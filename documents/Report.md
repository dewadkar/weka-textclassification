            any other resources you used
                ---NA
                
## Answer the following questions based on your experimental results.
1. Required: the top 30 features of each algorithm for each task.

            1. Label prediction:  features for [ChiSquare,InfoGain and GainRatio

3.  Which feature selection method works best? What seems to affect the performance of each algorithm?

4.  How many features are required for the different tasks, algorithms, and feature weight methods?
            -Number of feature for the task could not determined. 
            -Number of features for the algorithm evaluation, if less features mostly underfit and for more features it overfits.             - Methodlogy to determine the classifier features are unknown.

            

5.  Which text categorization algorithm is the most effective? Why it works better than other algorithms on this task?
           - Algorithms selected for the experiments are 1. J48-Decision tree 2. Naive Bayes 3. Support vector machine

6.  Required: Summarize what you have learned from this assignment at the end of the report.
