            My 1997 Dodge Neon has been running like a champ since I got it brand new off the lot.  It's made drives from Texas to Massachusetts and many other states in between.  On long trips and the daily 2 hours worth of commuting, it handles well in the heat of Texas and the snow and ice of New England.  

There are a couple of problems you should be aware of :

The trunk leaks slightly when it rains.  While this doesn't affect the performance of the car, it is something to look for.  Check and make sure the seals are tight on the trunk.  

Several '97 Neons (mine and my cousins' included) have an oil leak on the front driver's side.  Apparently this is due to a problem with the head gasket, and will need to be repaired.

(Update : As of 01/21/2000 I had my head gasket replaced and the little Neon is working great again with no oil leakage.  I took it to one of Chrysler's five-star dealerships and they did it for the price of the deductible on my service contract.  There is an alert out on this problem, so it has been acknowledged as an issue with pre-1999 Neons)
  


Gas mileage is decent getting about 28 to 30 miles per gallon (mostly highway driving).<br><br>
