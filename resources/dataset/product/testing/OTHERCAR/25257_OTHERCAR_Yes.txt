            I have now owned my 2001 Nissan Altima for 6 months, and I feel spoiled rotten. I absolutely love my car; it was the perfect next step from me from what I drove before. 

Background: I previously drove a 1997 Mazda Protege. I wanted a car that was a little bigger, but still good on gas, had a smooth ride, better acceleration/power than the Mazda, but I didn't need a sports car or prestige-mobile. I wanted quality, comfort, and price. This review deals with the GXE Limited Edition model, which has a great bundle of options for a reasonable price.

<b> The Car </b>
I will leave it to someone more knowledgable than I to go over all the engine specs, and focus on the drivability and feel. 
- Options: 8 way power drivers' seat, remote keyless entry and trunk release, power windows, locks, mirrors, AC, CD player,
- I also added a rear spoiler (for visibility in backing up the car more than for asthetics)

<b> The Good </b>
- This car is heavy enough to have a very smooth, comfortable ride, but still small enough to maneuver and park easily in the city.
- Great in snow, even better than my Mazda was, I assume because of the size and weight.
- For its size, gas mileage is good, 23-25 MPG city, 28 HW in my experience
- This car has above average storage - a 60-40 rear seat folddown, center console with two compartments, sunglass holder, nice touches with the in-dash compartments like rubber matting so things don't slide around.
- Acceleration and power very nice for an automatic. Smooth as silk transmission shifts.
- Great, responsive braking and handling. 
- Decent factory sound system. I particularly like the radio controls setup. 
- two power outlets, one in dash, one in center console. 
- Roomy, comfortable back seat. The 8 way power drivers' seat is a GREAT touch - makes long drives MUCH more comfortable.
- Excellent visibility; little to no blind spots.
- Good track record of Nissan reliability

<b> The Bad </b>
- Backing up, it is hard to see the trunk end if you do not have a spoiler. I added one aftermarket for this reason.
- Maybe it is just my car, but the remote entry has a very disappointing range, and the trunk release is moody. 
- Such a picky thing, but the gas cap is not attached to the car. I'm always afraid I will forget it. There is a slotted holder in the gastank cover for it though.
- Wish the gas tank held a little more (@12.5 gal)

<b> The Average </b> 
- Safety features, warranty, body styling, interior, all basically no better or worse than other cars. 

<b> What else did I look at? </b>
- 2001 Maxima
I loved this car, but it was more HP and gadgets than I needed for the money. I could have afforded either, but felt the value was more with the Altima. If one wanted a sportier car more than a sedan, but still with the function of a sedan, I would take a good look at the Maxima.

2001 Ford Focus
I came very very close to buying this car. It had some great features unique to its class - speed-sensitive volume programming, great stereo system, remote keyless, a cute, unique look, and a very peppy little engine! It got better gas mileage too, if I remember correctly. HOWEVER, the rear visibility was SO limited by the dumb back headrests that I just couldn't buy the car.

2001 Mazda Protege LX
This car I also loved, but once I had driven the bigger Altima, the softer ride and more powerful engine won out.

2001 Honda Civic LX
You know, I hated this car! The automatic had no pep, and I found it overpriced (and insurance wise, over stolen :) )It had nothing to offer other than the Honda name that set it apart from the other cars I drove.

<b> So, should I Buy One? </b>
I hear the 2002 model is getting a huge facelift, better engine, etc. This can be good or bad - I would hold out for the newer model, probably. However, the Altima is like the ignored stepchild between the Sentra and Maxima, I hadn't even thought of one until I went to drive the Maxima. So, cash back and financing incentives are impressive for this car.
