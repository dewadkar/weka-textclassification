            As an advit chevy buyer I must say I love the chevy venture. I purchased one a couple of months ago for my wife and she loves it. I still have another chevy parked right next to it in the garage and will always be a chevy buyer. The venture is so roomy and the added sliding door is just magnificent. The space is spacious and comfortable. The only thing that is a negative is the effort you need to make to get to the back seats. This could be considerate in the new versions to make it more accessible to get to. The venture handles good and rides real smooth. I know it's new, but i've had new cars that didn't ride this smooth during demo rides. The warner brothers edition was a nice try, but the screen is to small for the individuals who have to watch from the side. I love the mechanical sliding door, but I hope it holds up over the years. So overall I give the venture a strong 9. This is a perfect vehicle for the family of 5 or more. Keep it up Chevrolet.<br><br>
