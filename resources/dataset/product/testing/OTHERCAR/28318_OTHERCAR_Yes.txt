                <b>Corvette's</b> have been around for well over 40 years now, but none has the sophistication of the latest model (2002 Z06). The 98 C5 is not quite as fast, and is not as sporty looking as the Z06, but it still has the typical stunning performance of a Vette. The 98 model, unlike previous Corvette's ('96 and earlier models) are without the major compromise which made Vettes so hard to live with; the rough ride, etc.

<i>Driving Impressions:</i>
           
<b>T</b>he C5 signals Corvette's return to a true 'go-fast' machine. It is truly an almost perfect blend of comfort and performance. <b>Acceleration</b> is excellent! The alloy LS1 V8 engine revs instantly in response to its new electronic throttle control and sends this car soaring to 60 MPH is less than 5 seconds (according to specs) and past 150 MPH with reported "ease" (also according to specs). In other words, this car is very fast! Thanks to a redesigned body that is 4 times stiffer than its predecessor, the '98 Vette doesn't creak, groan or shudder over bumps, and the longer wheelbase and roomier cabin combine to make it much more comfortable than the pre '97 models. The 6-speed adds for some comfortable cruising thanks to the tall final gear ratio. <b>Braking</b> is awesome, after driving around a Ford Mustang the brakes took some getting used to, as they are very touchy just like the throttle.

      <b>B</b>ecause the Corvette has a fiberglass body, it has to have  a separate steel frame. A new  composite floor has been added, with a balsa wood layer sandwiched between two steel sheets, to stiffin the whole structure. The <b>suspension</b> features cast alloy arms, a multi link rear end for maximum control, and monofilament leaf springs made of composite material which are lighter and more space efficient.

      <b>Power</b> comes from a relatively new (at the time) small block Chevy V8, known as the LS1. The engine block is made of cast aluminum and fortified with 6-boldt main bearing caps and an alloy oil pan. It is still a traditional over head valve design, but thanks to redesigned cylinder heads, composite induction system, advanced engine management, and electronic fuel injection, the LS1 revs flawlessly through its power band, almost as well as a SOHC design. Maximum power(345hp) is reached at 5,400 RPM, while torque peak (350) is in full swing by 4,400 RPM. A 6-speed manual transmission and a 4-speed automatic is available.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

     The <b>interior</b> of this car is more than sporty, it's a combination of beautifully laid out ergonomics, piled to the brim with amenities. The completely redesigned cockpit makes the C5 corvette more comfortable and user friendly than most sports cars on this planet for this model year. However you will note that, compared to newer sports cars like the M3 Coupe, you will find the interior to be a bit dated and perhaps a bit cheap. The plastics in the C5 are not exactly up to par, and the leather seating feels almost as cheap as the much cheaper Ford Mustangs. These seats are supportive however and offer enough bolstering for aggressive driving.


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

    The <b>exterior</b> looks a little like the 1993-1995 Mazda RX7's , but it's more aggressive looking. Dual exhaust, with quad tailpipes make this car look like it is a rocket. This car is very aerodynamic looking, and is just that. The '98 Vette has a very low drag coefficient. This is a car that will turn heads no matter where you go, be prepared to be stopped by persons that just have to tell you how nice your car is. (Update) With newer cars entering the market for the 2003 model year the '98 C5 Vette does not turn heads like it used to. Even the Z06 can be lost in traffic, as these cars are becoming a dime a dozen.


<i>Price:</i>

             The <b>price</b> has always been right for the performance the Vette offers. Even used this car will offer style, class, and performance for as long as you own it. The '98 Vette started out at around $40,000 back in 98, but now you can expect one for around $35,000 or less.

      I don't own this car so I can not personally comment of reliability, but from sea to shining sea, these cars have been ruling the roads for years, with from what I hear, "no fuss."  


<i>Conclusion:</i>


If you are looking for a used 2 seater that offers amazing performance attributes in almost category the '98 Corvette is definitely worth a test drive.
