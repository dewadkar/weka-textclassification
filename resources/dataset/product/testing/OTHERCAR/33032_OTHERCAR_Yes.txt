            I purchased my 1998 Dodge Ram 1500 used.  I bought it to replace my previous vehicle.  It had about 16000 miles on it and I got it for a really good price.  This was my first time buying a used vehicle and I had my reservations at first.  I had heard alot of good things about Dodge truck ever since they had re-introduced themselves in the early 90's.  I must say that this truck has been the best vehicle I have owned.  It is driven over 80 miles a day to work and I have not had any major problems since I have owned it.  Only maintenance that has been performed was for a catalytic converter that failed which was covered by warranty.  I have done all oil, brake, air filter, and coolant hose changes myself as this is all that it has needed in 1 1/2 years of ownership.  It has a 360 cubic inch V8 that will deliver all the performance you could want and sounds really great with the Flowmaster's I have added.  I like the fact that it rides as good or better than my previous car, a 1993 Grand Am GT.  The styling is what caught my attention at first.  Even though other truck makers have re-designed, nothing comes close to Dodge.  It still looks updated even though the basic design is at least 6 years old.  The SLT package gives you chrome rims, cassette, electric side mirrors, tow package, bedliner (sometimes), 4 speed overdrive, lots of storage, split 40/20/40 seating, and other trim options.  I never thought I would own a truck, but now that I own this one I will probably never own a passenger car again.  If you are looking for a good truck to work or play in, this is the one for you.      <br><br>
