            Have you ever owned that one car that you can never let go of? Well I have and it was an '89 Honda Accord Sedan Gold with all the apointments that we needed/ could afford. At the time we bought the car in 1992 for 12k i think we were in love with Hondas after our love affair with an 1987 Honda Civic there was no way we were going to pass up this car. 

Performance
The car runs decent for 92 hp but it isnt a nascar favorite. also it has 123k on the odometer and it sitting in front of my house as a show piece. 

Looks
I love the looks of Hondas this is not my daily driving car, although i wish it were since it looks awesome, ever after some body damage (thanks a lot sis) 

Trans:
We have had the trans rebuilt at 108k and it runs strong now it was costly 800 bucks but it was definetly worth it.

Value 
12 grand 8 years of enjoyment, no need to explain Hondas are worth money, just dont buy an American (the way to tell is looking at the vin and if it starts with a H walk away), READ ME SOON TO COME 1998 Honda Accord which is nice and dependable, but no very cheap to keep.

Stereo
Honda has great speakers as does my 95 Accord (or my brothers, i wish i had it) the speakers are loud and inpressive for that car.

Size and styling
Small the way i like my cars and it looks sportly with flip up headlights

NOW IT CANT ALL BE GOOD YOU SAY 

Well it isnt i have had my radiator repaired/ replaced and i need a new , engine at 123 k which is horible they say a piston is not working, Hondas are also known for needing main relay swithes, which is what i need and that is where the car needs a few turns to start (i found this out after getting a new starter) i have also stoped work on this car since i have an awesom running '88 camry and am looking to get 94-95 accord 2 dr, like they say brothers think a like.
