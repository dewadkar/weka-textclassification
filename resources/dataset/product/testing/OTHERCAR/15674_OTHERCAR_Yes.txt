            Read this review if you are interested in a 6 month evaluation, if you are very tall, and if you want to read about service issues.

Bottom Line

I leased for four years based on a $35,500 purchase price, exclusive of tax and license.  This is the best car I've owned (comparisons: Saab 9-3, Toyota Celica, Mercury Capri, Pontiac Firebird, Ford Escort).  I've experienced a few minor glitches, but all and all, a most satisfying experience so far.  One big plus: great head room without the sun roof.  I look forward to driving this car every day.

Appearance

This is a beautiful car, inside and out.  You can see the car for yourself, what I can add is that as much as I liked the car when I first saw it, I find it even more attractive now.  Mine is black.  The standard paint job looks great, and draws spontaneous praise from strangers.  The interior has worn very well so far, and is pleasing in every way.

Performance and Handling

Compared to cars I've owned in the past, this car is truly a winner.  I've never felt a lack of power, and the acceleration is first rate for city and freeway driving.  As compared to standard American sedans (e.g. Taurus) that I frequently rent, the C320 has sporty handling, but it lacks the firm "sports car" feel of the BMW M3, which a friend owns and I have driven for comparison.  After experiencing the M3, I find myself still completely enamored of the handing of the C320.  Unless you are a true enthusiast, I think you will find the C320's performance and handling to be very nice indeed.  If you have never owned a car in this segment (e.g. BMW, Audi, etc.), I think you are in for a very pleasant surprise.

One special note on handling: I have almost always driven a manual in the past.  I find this automatic quite satisfying, and the quasi-manual mode is very good if you want to move through the gears yourself.

Reliability

I've had some minor glitches worth noting.  The power seat system failed twice.  The second time they took the issue seriously and fixed the problem which has not recurred.  The cupholder (a very elaborate fold out design) failed once and was immediately replaced.  Service was prompt and courteous, and loaners were offered.  I would rate this experience as better than Saab but not as good as my extremely reliable and problem free Toyota Celica.

Value

I bought the base C320 without options.  In my opinion, this is quite a good deal, pricing out at less than $36,000.  Indeed, used C320s frequently sell for much more.  Gas mileage is not great.  I get less than 20 mpg driving a congested freeway route with a lot of stop and go.

Interior Cabin (and the Height Issue)
You can skip this section if you are of average height.

I am 6'6", but I have relatively short legs and a long torso for my height.  (If you have long legs, then you would be about 6'8" or taller for my torso length.)  If you are in this category, then you know that it is very difficulty to find a car with adequate headroom.  This problem is especially acute if you are looking in the near-luxury or luxury market, because most manufacturers in this segment routinely include sunroofs which substantially reduce headroom.  I bought the absolutely base model of the C320, which includes full power seats but no sunroof.  With this combination, the car has incredible headroom--the best I've seen in anything short of a full-sized sedan (the largest Lincolns, Cadillacs, etc.).  I compared with Audis, BMWs, Lexus, Infiniti, Acura, Volkwagen Passat, and several other cars, and this was the best headroom I found.  With the sunroof, I did not fit and I would estimate that there is about a 2 1/2 inch difference in headroom, with and without the sunroof.
