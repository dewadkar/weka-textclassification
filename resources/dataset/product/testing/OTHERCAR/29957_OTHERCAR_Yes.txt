            I really don't have TOO much against the caravan it's just I don't love it or like it enough to reccomend it. I believe that Dodges can be dependable cars but as a former owner of a durango they can also be the biggest hassle and pain in the butt you'll ever lay eyes on. I believe that there are just many other mini-vans and SUVs out there that are more appealing for carrying around large groups and more dependable. I really don't know the fine details about miles per gallon and such but save this car for others to buy and go get yourself something that you can rely on and that'll last you a while.<br><br>
