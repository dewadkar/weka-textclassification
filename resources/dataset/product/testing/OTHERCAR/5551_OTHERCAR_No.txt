            WUT a mistake.. its worth more in scrap metal.. What a total hunk of dung this car is! I bought it out of insanity in 1997 for I got tired of riding my bike to work. What a big mistake that would cost me thousands of dollars. I thought because it's inexpensive, it would be cheap of course, but at least can run for a year or more. It has been nothing but a problem ever since I've had it.  The gas mileage also is laughable, it seems like all i'm doing is going to a gas station. Avoid this car AT ALL COSTS.  If you have a couple thousands of dollars to waste, give it to ME and i'll give you my bike which is worth more.
ULTIMATELY, this car is not for anyone except for the mentally insane or handicaped (no offense)
