            I have been driving a <b>Chevy S-10 Tahoe</b> for the past 8 years and have loved having a truck. After being limited to only 1 other passenger, I decided to purchase an SUV. I looked at the <i>Ford Explorer/Expeditions</i> - too boxy; <i>The Infinity</i> - too expensive; the <i>Lexus/BMW/Mercedes SUV's</i> - too expensive and for sissy's.  The <b>Dodge Durango</b> was the only option.  

Even though the gas mileage is not that great, I have never felt so good about a purchase, especially since I talked the dealer down from $35,000 to $29,000.  I love my Durango - great family vehicle.  I'll never buy a van again.  Also, I still kept my truck.<br><br>
