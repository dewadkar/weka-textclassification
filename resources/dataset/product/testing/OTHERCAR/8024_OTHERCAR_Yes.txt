             I was looking for an easy to use Digital camera- and I found it in the Ricoh-300Z .Purchased through a large on-line retailer it came to me with all the necessary hardware to start loading pictures on my E-mails immediately.
Although small and easy to use, it does have a major drawback in its heavy battery consumption. I recommend that you use the AC power cord when using flash indoors.I've had a number of pictures made into 4 x 6 prints and was very happy with the clarity even on the lower resolution settings.Good starter camera-but I'll be upgrading as soon as the budget allows--maybe to another Ricoh!<br><br>
