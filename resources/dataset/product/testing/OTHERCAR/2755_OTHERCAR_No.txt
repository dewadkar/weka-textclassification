            My Jetta caused me nothing but problems. I entered into a lease for a few years while I was still in school for a Jetta Trek. I didn't care about the bike that came with it and just gave that away, I thought the car looked nice. My Whole family has VW's we all got them from the same place. In fact, we had three Jettas counting mine. Mine was the newest, I needed something reliable while I was in Law School that wouldn't give me any trouble, I bought the wrong car.
This car served me somewhat reliably the first year, In fact, I Loved it. The love was soon lost, when things began to not work right. First it was the heater, That got fixed by the dealership, then the radio which was also fixed, but they said it wasn't covered and billed me for it, I was not happy about either of these things. I had a car that was only a year and a half old! 
I should have known from the start I may be in for some problems when the dealership gave me such a hard time throwing in the bra for the car when I was negotiating the lease, I mean, come on- you're dealing with a family that has bought 3 of your cars and you won't through in some silly leather thing ?
Then one day it happened, I was driving to work on the highway, during rush hour, when all of a sudden no power- I was so scared, I almost got killed in that car. The transmission went. An automatic transmission went after owning the car under 2 years.
Needless to say the dealership said I had to complete the lease and pay for some of the repairs. 
I was of a different opinion, and by now had completed law school.
I did not have the car after that day. I did not have a lease anymore either. I had a saturn a few weeks later.
No problems since.
