            I was hesitate to get into the all digital scene.  I still think that digital is not as good or as fun as the 35mm scene.  But I can't just stay back in the pre-digital age, afterall my Canon EOS Elan IIE is a bit high tech for a 35mm camera.

Heres where the story starts...

My brother has a Fujifilm FinePix 1400.  He loves it, and puts up hundreds of online images at a time.  He and I have argued over the quality, benefits, and the overall thoughts of SLR vs Digital.  His key point, he can basically shoot to infinity and not have to pay one penny to getting the film develop.  I, on the other hand, have 30+ rolls that need developing.  Hmmmmmm, get them all develop will well cost me this camera.  So, I have came to the decision of not forgeting the 35mm SLR arena, but merely also playing in the digital field.  I haven't forgotten my dreams of setting up my darkroom, but a digital camera and this camera has a lot of benefits.  So, here goes...

"The Fujifilm FinePix 2300�s 2.11 Million Pixel CCD is perfect for 5x7 and 8x10 picture taking (1600 x 1200 pixels)."  This is one of the statements or thoughts that got me to buy the Fuji and try it out for myself.

An avid amateur photographer, I love taking good pictures and pictures that can be reproduce in good quality and enlarged without losing too much quality.  Since I was on a budget, actually this was a bday gift, this was the best digital camera, I could get at the time.

Heres more detail about what you are getting with this camera, following with my further thoughts of the camera and then a brief conclusion statement...

This camera gives you three different resolutions to choose from:  choose from 1600x1200, 1280x960, or 640x480.  Then you have the option of choosing to have fine, normal or basic quality on the 1600 res.  The 1280 res you can choose between fine and normal.  However on the 640 res. it defaults to normal.  These choices, I just mentioned dealing with the quality, makes a difference on how many images that can be stored on the SmartMedia card.  I usually use the fine quality 1280 res.  This gives me a good res. while still adequately enough to use for my manipulating digital images for my desktop wallpaper.  For general Internet use the 640 res. will probably be more than adequate enough.  However, I like the freedom to work with the image, and if you take the shot in 640, then its like cutting your hair too short, you can only live with it, or wait for the opportunity to happen again.  Fuji doesn't leave you in the dark when it comes to knowing roughly how many shots you have left to take, there is an indicator in the upper-right-hand side of the lcd view to indicate the estimated # of images you can still shoot.

The camera gives you the option of choosing macro (close-up photography) or normal (general photography).  

The camera can go into three modes.  1) Setup mode - use this to set the camera's resoultion, time, date, etc.  2) Shooting mode - Self-explainatory.  3) Playback mode - this is the least used mode for me.  From this mode, you can view the images stored on your SmartMedia card, delete the ones you don't want to keep, delete all the images on the card, or format the card.  I choose to do all the stuff the playback mode does on my computer.  The ease of the USB allows me to just as quickly if not more quicker, go through the files (images).  I would advice the same as the menus or commands on the camera can be a bit difficult to decipher.

One of the smart options on the camera is the option of several choices when it comes to using the small built-in flash unit.  You may set it on auto mode, force it to use flash, suppress flash, red-eye reduction, or slow Synchro.  This is important when you have a mindset of how you want your pictures to come out.  Use the force-flash to illuminate someone's face when the background is the sun or a bright light, otherwise you will not get the details of their face.  Use the force-not-to-flash when you want to keep the nature look of a dark or shady place.  The red-eye reduction choice is pretty self-explainatory, use this when you fear you might get a picture with red eyes or you can usually find most graphic programs have an effect to fix this problem.  The slow Synchro mode allows you to use the flash (to get the details of your subject) while the slow synchro allows the dark background to still have decent and natural details.

There are many features this camera has that to comment adequately on all of them would be more than you would probably want to read, so I will briefly mention some of the other features of this camera.

This camera has/allows...
  a ten second self-timer
  gives you the control of setting the brightness 
  gives you the control on setting the white balance.
  many more features.

I found this camera to be fairly easy to use.  You can pretty much use it as a snapshot camera, or you can really get into it and maximize the quality of your pictures.  With a digital camera, such as this, you can make a new desktop wallpaper every day if you like, no more same ol' same ol' boring picture.  This camera allows to basically shoot infinite number of pictures, without having to develop them, which is quite costly, and you don't have to worry about using a scanner.  This camera comes with several programs to help maximize your use.  

I recommend this camera, although it does have some minor disadvantages, it doesn't look very sturdy, and the menu options can be a bit of a hassle.  Overall, this is a great digital camera to start out on with just about all the basics covered.  Tres Bien Fuji!
