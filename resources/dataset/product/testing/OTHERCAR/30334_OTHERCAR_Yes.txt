            I owned an Acura Legend from 1990 to roughly 1995 and I actually wish I still own one.  Unfort unately, the car was totalled in an accident in Virginia in 95 but that had nothing to do with car's faults or anything.  I think the LEgend is up there with some of the best great buy automobiles.  It has the feel of a sports car, combined with luxury, for the price of a compact.  The cruise control, acceleration, and comfort of the interior is unrivaled by cars in its class. There were no major problems with the car either.  I liked every single one of its features and even a decade ago, it had things that many cars lack today.  Along the same lines, I also recommend you check out the Nissan Altima.<br><br>
