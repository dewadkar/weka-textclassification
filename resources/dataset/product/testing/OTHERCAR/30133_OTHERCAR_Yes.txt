            My friend owns this car and we drive to golf every week.  The course is in the hills (Lake Chabot Golf Course) and the road is really curvy and windy.  And through these trips I've come up with my own opinions of the 1995 Saab 900.

The first useful aspect of the 900 is the trunk space.  The trunk can fit both our golf bags have lots of room leftover.  There's also a fair amount of room in the back row of seats.  The head room is ample, but the foot space is a little cramped.  The front passenger seat is <b>very</b> roomy, with enough space to stretch your legs.  (But I always have to sit in the back, oh well)

Another thing I noticed was the acceleration.  On freeway on-ramps the 900 struggles a little to get up to speed.  I would say it has moderate acceleration; sufficient  but somewhat lacking.

Back to the curving roads.  While turning on those, I noticed some body roll on the car.  It has good handling, but I think the stabilizer bars should be a little stiffer.  Some people prone to car sickness might feel a bit quesey while riding the the 900.

But one very important thing to note is that my friend's 900 has been to the shop multiple times.  He's even considered trying to declare it a lemon.  So keep in mind that if you purchase the 1995 900 you might have to make multiple repairs and fix-ups.

I think that the 1995 Saab 900 is a good car overall. It's one BIG problem is reliability.  Over 2 visits to the shop per year is too much.  So if buying a used 900, make sure it has a manufacturers used car warranty or something like that, just to be safe.
