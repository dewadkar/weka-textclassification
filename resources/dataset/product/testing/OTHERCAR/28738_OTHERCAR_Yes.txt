            I had a 92 Mits Eclipse, the AWD Turbo DOHC GSX.  That is a mouthful and each of those items added more power and fun to this rocket-like auto.  The steroe was cd/cass, it had 2 levels of AC, sunroof, mag wheels, tilt, cruise and a driver that loved speed.  I owend this little number in Anchorage Alaska, which was awesome in the snow and ice.  I could actually drive the car sideways down the icy roads, and very often passed pickup trucks that were afraid of the snow.  Due to limited law enforcement up there and doing late night fishing runs 100 miles away, it was common to set the cruise at 120 MPH and rifle down the large stretches of barren road.  Of course, I was admired by friends for all the fun I appeared to be having, but what they don't know is the behind the scenes story.  I went threw $600 dollars a year in tires.  Mind you, AWD does not really peel out, it just takes corners very easily at double the speed limit. By 50,000 miles it was on its 3rd transmission because the early model had practically plastic gears in the box. One major safety hazard with this, if your transmission locks up, AWD becomes ALL WHEELS LOCKED. Which happened to me on the thruway and I came to a screeching halt and had to pay much $$ to be towed off a state road.  They also had to take apart the transmission right there because they couldn't move it forward or back.  These cars are a blast, too bad they ruined the look with the 2000.  I highly recommend this vehicle, but have some backup cash for emergencies.<br><br>
