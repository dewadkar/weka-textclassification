            As with most electronic devices, digital cameras will continue to come out with newer and greater models.  There are higher pixel cameras on the market that have more memory, but for the price this camera does an excellent job.

Accompanied with PhotoWise software, this camera makes it very easy for even a novice computer user to take pictures and have them on their PC within minutes.  All that is needed is to load the software and connect the camera to the PC with a serial cable.  The pictures are then loaded onto the PC into a dated directory so you know when the pictures were taken (nice).  Some of the options of this camera are:

Settings for size of picture (larger the picture, the fewer you can take before the memory is full).
Removable memory card 
Option to take pictures in 5 or 10 seconds 
180 degree lens
ability to view pictures on the camera and delete them if necessary
day/night settings
flash/fill/red-eye/no flash settings

Particularly if you're selling items on ebay or if you're going to make a family web page, this camera takes quality pictures, but isn't so complex you can't figure out how to use it.

The only downside to this camera is that sometimes it'll get stuck in 'download' mode, which has happened all of once in the four years I've had it.  Plus it absolutely EATS batteries.  It takes four AA batteries, I find myself turning the camera on and off quite frequently at gatherings or holidays to try and conserve power.  A must-have accessory for this reason is an external power supply.  I could not do without this item with this camera.
