            In the spring of 2000, I decided that I needed a sporty little convertible because I live in Florida and drive around a lot on my job.  I wanted a fun car!!!  I looked at a lot of new convertibles, and then stopped in to the BMW dealer &quot;just to look around&quot; &lt;laugh&gt;. 

The salesperson at the dealership was so nice, and he showed me around the lot and showed me the service area, and the &quot;BMW Spa&quot;.  He pointed out a lot of cars, with a lot of options.......and really listened to what I wanted in a car...price, options, even color.  I fell in love with a 1997 BMW 328iC....seafoam green with camel leather...and it had every option imaginable. 

t drove like a dream....and then he told me that because it was a &quot;pre-owned certified car&quot;...the warranty was extended to 100,000 miles...and the dealership perks included free car washes every Saturday (includes vacuuming the interior, getting the love bugs off the paint, and armor-all-ing the wheels), free loaner car if and when I have to bring my car in for repairs, and free coffee and goodies while I wait.  He told me that they would even buff out the little scratches I found on the paint...so that the car would &quot;look brand new&quot;.   The Pre-Owned Certified Inspection included them inspecting EVERYTHING on the car, and I got all brand new tires too.  The car only had 38,000 miles on it....so the warranty was even better than a new car warranty!!!!! They made the financing so easy....and treated me so nicely. 

The car rides like a dream...it is so much fun.  I wanted to take it into the house with me, I loved it so much!!!!  The controls are easy to use....and there was an audio tape that takes you through everything you need to know about knobs and switches and how to run the on-board computer....everything is powered...even the top...and the seats feel good, and the carpet is plush.

I get about 20 mpg in the city, and there are lights that tell you when to take it in for service and what is wrong with it....the car monitors when you need an oil change and stuff so you don't have to watch the odometer.  The trunk is ok in size...not overly large, but for the type of car, it is fine...it holds a lot of groceries and other stuff.  It has a back seat, but I don't think I would want to ride in it for long unless I cut my legs off....not that much leg room in the back but it would be ok for kids.  The seats are all leather and VERY comfortable, even in the back. The driver seat is adjustable so many ways that for sure you will find a comfortable position for you no matter how much you drive.  Driving this car is undescribable...it is truly an &quot;ultimate driving machine&quot;...it handles well on all kinds of roads and on rainy roads too....it has built in traction correction so on dirt roads it is great too. 

As for the type of person who should buy this type of car:  someone who loves to drive and loves to have fun driving and who wants to drive the best handling car.  Oh yes, the sound system is great too...8 speakers.  And with the top down, you can still hear the sound system...and WOW!!! driving with the top down......with the wind whipping through your hair...it is great.  It is a HOT car that will get you where you are going in style!!!!!
