            I purchased it back in 1999 when they first came out.
It's everything I expected it to be with possible exception of gas milage (maybe that's because i've never owned trucks or SUVs before - I get around 17mi/gal in a mix of city/hwy driving)
Excellent handling and car-like ride!
Don't like positioning of some of the controls (like Cruise Control for example - one has to reach down and around the steering wheel)
Haven't had any problems with it since I bought it.
Seems to be pretty sturdy quality.

Hate the new 2001 shape and the fact that they came out with a redesign 1 year after the launch of 2000 model - that's really screwy toward 2000 owners.<br><br>
