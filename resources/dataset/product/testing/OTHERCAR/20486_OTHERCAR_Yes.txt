            Now I've had my 300zx Twin Turbo for about 2 months now and I have to say that I'm still in love with it! There's nothing about this car I don't like!. I have never driven a car that can grip the road like the Twin Turbo. Freeway on ramps will become the favorite part of your day ;)

This car has classic looks that never seem dated. The smooth lines keep the drag down and the heads turning. Everyone's excited about the new Z that's coming out in a couple years, but what most people don't realise is that this car is still in production and selling in many foreign markets. How many sports cars have you heard of that can survive relatively unchanged for over 10 years? Just more proof that this car was WAY ahead of it's time, as was the Toyota Supra Turbo and the late model RX-7 and 3000gt VR4. 

The 300zx accelerates well for such a heavy car, it's 300hp moving it well off the line, but much better if you get the revs up a bit first. Like most small displacement Japanese engines, the 300zx's 3.0 litre V6 doesn't have much down-low torque, but it makes up for it in spades when it's two Garret Turbo Chargers spool up. It'll catch you by surprise the first couple of times, but it's a very pleasant surprise! The engine is smooth and refined, with lots of high-tech goodies packed under that crowded hood. Until '95 Nissan was using it's own version of Variable Valve Timing that is similar to BMWs in that it works on the intake side only. Providing better low-end torque and throttle responce at low speeds. 

As wonderful as the powerplant is, the 300zx's true strength lies in it's handling. With all-wheel steering and a variable ride stiffness, this car can be a twisty highway road warrior, or a much more civilised executive sports car with a simple flick of a switch. The suspension is quite clever and unique in that it's a variant of the double wishbone setup with an elongated upper control arm to accomodate the engine bay's layout. The result is a car that feels like it will never lose grip no matter how insanely fast you go into a corner. The back-end will come out on you, but you really have to either be trying, or be a very poor driver.

The interior is much roomier that it appears at first glance and the seats are right up there with the best of any luxury sedan. The stock Bose sounds system is okay, but quite clever. Unfortunately it also makes it very difficult to place an aftermarket unit in the car (since you have to replace all of the speakers and the speaker housings aren't standard sizes.) The shifter is firm and comfortable, but to my dismay the steering wheel is not adjustable in any way. This can make it a little awkward for taller drivers such as myself. Another thing that bother me was how cramped the footwell was for my size 11 feet. You do get used to both problems though, and I feel they're minor issues.

The only other negative on the car is the repair issue. I feel that the Z is one of the most reliable sports cars ever built, but everything eventually needs to be fixed, even the best cars. Repairs are costly and time consuming with this car. The Nissan dealership here says it will take 20 hours of labour to replace both the turbos on my car, but I've heard it can be done faster by pulling the engine. If you take good care of the car, and replace the oil regularly, your Z should last you a life time.
