            I have read the opinions on this car and had to give my own.  I bought the avenger ES with the 4 cyl. 16 valve manual transmission.  I have found that it has lost of pep.  I can make the kids squeal just by hitting the on-ramp.  It corners like nothing I have ever driven.  I put 190 miles on it the first 24 hours I had it and a lot of those were making the rounds showing friends and family and taking them for rides.  Lots of starting the car and when I put gas in it the next day I got 28 mpg out of it.  Can't wait for a road trip!  It has a roomy back seat.  My husband is 6'2 and would rather ride back there!  OK by me!! I bought the car with 80,000 miles on it and there is nothing wrong with the compression or anything else.  Parking in a lot is something you need to relearn because it doesn't turn very sharp but we also own a dodge ram 2500 ext cab.  We are used to parking and taking up two spots!!  The only thing I have to get used to is the road noise you get when you have the low profile tires that are on the ES.
It is also my opinion that this car looks best Dodge Red but each to his own.  My daughter is 13 and I can drop her off in front of the school again!!! HOORAY!
