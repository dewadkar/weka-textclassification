            The plan was that my 1991 gray Saturn SL with 90,000 miles would be sold after I bought my new car. I cleaned her up and took her around to a few dealerships and used car lots and found that no one really wanted to give me more than $1,000 for the car.

A thousand dollars?! That's all? For a car that has served me like such a champ for nine years? There was no way I was going to part with my automotive companion for such a miniscule amount of money.

I bought my Saturn when I was in college and didn't have money to scrape together for real furniture. It was the lowest end model of the first model year ever produced by this fledgling company. I had no idea what to expect, but at under $10,000 it was cheaper than a comparable Honda or Toyota model.

The Saturn has seen me through many road trips, numerous close calls on bumper to bumper traffic, hauling everything from an 8' maple tree (thank goodness for those 60/40 dividing seats) to a patio table for my deck. It's never failed me on the road, although it has had its share of small troubles.

I had to have the alternator and battery replaced right at 60,000 miles. The clutch had to be replaced at 70,000 miles. The car burns a slight amount of oil, but if oil changes are performed every 3,000 miles with regularity, it's not a problem.

This is not a glamorous, cute or high performance car by any means. But when it's snowing, gray, gross and muddy outside and I need to transport a dining room table from a friend's house in another state back to my home, I know my Saturn will rise to the occasion.<br><br>
