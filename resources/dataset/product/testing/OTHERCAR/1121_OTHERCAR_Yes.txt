            Having owned many Dodge and Chrysler products, I was eager to see how the Neon stacked up.  As my drive to work is 35 miles one-way, I needed a comfortable vehicle which was good on fuel (therefore a small car) but with some amount of punch.  I was not looking for a family car, although I thought four doors would be good for my four children, just in case.  I looked at and drove the 1999 Neon first (less expensive), the 1999 Stratus seemed too big (read �lower fuel economy�) for just me (which is 95% of the time, we have a Caravan for the family).  And, just for kicks and grins, the Stealth was way out of my price range.  

What sealed it was that I was singularly unimpressed with the driver�s legroom under the steering wheel in the �99 Neon and since my legs would pass so much time under there it seemed a large concern.  Although I leaned slightly toward the styling of the �99, the Y2K Neon is much roomier and just had a better �sense� to it.  Since I would be spending my time looking from the inside out rather than outside in, I figured that my physical comfort was more important than any perceptual advantage an outside viewer might gain.  The seats are comfortable and the driver is afforded a very good �traffic picture� by the ample glass around the vehicle.  The only problem with the �view� might be the vertical door post behind and to the left of the driver in the 4-door model, it tends to obstruct the over-the-shoulder �look back� during lane changes, but I can�t imagine that it would be different in many models or makes.

The engine in my Y2K Neon is a fuel-injected, 2.0 liter, 4-cylinder, 16-valve with a good amount of pep for its economy (rated at 37MPG highway, I�m getting closer to 32 � but I drive it like a Porsche).  Without a tachometer (strangely offered in the �automatic� version, but not in the �manual�) the driver needs to listen and feel to get the most out of the engine; it does have a �flat spot� or two on its torque curve.  These are notable with the 5-speed transmission and will quickly become apparent with under-rev shifting, but with a little experience, the driver will learn to avoid them; they are apparent but not annoying.  I appreciate the Neon�s suspension and tight steering, it transmits the �feel� of the road without all of the teeth-jarring or wheel vibration that accompanies many other tight-handling vehicles and the Goodyear tires that come standard are well-chosen.

So, on July 11th I bought it.  How do I remember this?  Because 24 days later, on August 4th I was �party one� in a rear-end collision on the freeway.  I didn�t even have the plates on the vehicle yet.  So, it is with this unique experience that I can rate the vehicle from a crash-test perspective.  In the split second between the horrible realization of impending danger and impact, several things went through my mind: the vehicle does not come standard with anti-lock brakes (my Caravan does -- �why am I not stopping?�), the brakes lock up solid and the steering is tight, but even front-wheel-drive is not very responsive while in a 4-wheel skid.  So, it was armed with this newfound knowledge that I slammed into the vehicle in front of me, still moving at about 20MPH.  As the braking had been intense, the front of the vehicle had dipped low and luckily I had veered slightly left.  The front end of the car scooped under the target vehicle and I was spared the deployment of the airbags.  Sitting in the aftermath, I remember thinking that it wasn�t so bad, the vehicle took the impact very well.  Attesting to solid front-end construction, even the body shop was impressed at how well the frame and engine compartment had taken the collision.  I was able to drive off the freeway, but was precluded from continuing under my own power by a punctured radiator.

Now that I�ve spun my tale of woe, the car has been repaired ($4,000) and I have eclipsed my previous record of 24 consecutive days without incident.  I cannot say that no other car would have held up better, I can only say that the Neon held up well and did me proud.  Of course, in hindsight, ABS would be wonderful.  I have pined away for automatic door locks, possibly power windows, but these are relatively minor inconveniences, and considering the commensurate increase in price, I will happily do without.  Even so, Dodge�s attention to detail is evident.  From a quality sound system (I don�t pretend to be an audiophile), to a real trunk light, to the auto-dimming dome light (it doesn�t just turn off, it dims down), the Dodge Neon is a solidly-built, small car that is easy on the pocket and the fuel bill.  It is stylish enough for me, as I imagine it would be for most, and comfortable enough to take that long leisurely drive.  Windows up, it is quiet enough for passengers to whisper and be heard, after all, it's not a Cadillac.

Barring other traffic calamity, I think I�ll keep mine for awhile.  I know I�ll enjoy it.
