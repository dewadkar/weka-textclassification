The 98 MPV was a upgrade from our 96 MPV. We had been using the 96 for at least 1-2 years, when the time came for my dad to get rid of the 86 Toyota van we had. When we went to the Mazda dealers, we traded in the Toyota van for a 1999 Mazda Protege (this was May 1999) (see my Mazda Protege review). 

At that same time, while at the dealership, we noticed in the showroom a brand new 1998 Mazda MPV van, Sports Edition 4x4. The look of this MPV over the 96, was way better, plus this had many more options.

My dad, the good dealer he is, worked out a great with doing 2 tradein's and we ended up getting 2 brand new vehicles. 

The 98 MPV is not only a van. It is a SUV. Sure its got more than the average seating (total of 8 seating avali. Its also got 4 doors, which at the time, most vans did not, or at least thats when they started to come out with them. (Our 96 model only had 3 doors). It comes with a 3.0L 155 hp V6 engine, which is not bad at all. (sure its nothing compared to many of the SUV's today). 

It has on demand 4x4 avali which is easy to engage at the toggle of a switch. It also has center differental lock (which I haven't really understood the full meaning of that), BUT, to what i believe it means as it locks up all of the tires, when you're in 4x4. It comes in handy when going up steep, right snow/ice roads.

We've had to use that once, when going up to a friends cabin in Chilliwack. It was the winter months, and going up the mountain, it was quite icy, and snowy at the same time. Having our full family in the van (pretty much 5 adults), power wasn't a problem, and switching all the flips the MPV took us all the way up, with not problems.

One side note, that I found absolutely wild about the MPV is the spare tire. It is a FULL size spare tire, with same mags. Now unlike some other SUV's out there (ex: my brothers 2001 Pathfinder) the MPV has the matching tire, so your vehicle doesn't look like it has the odd tire out.

Other than that, the MPV has a fair amount of storage space, and it is quite easy to pull out the seats if needed for extra space (ex: going camping/skiing). Yes it did come with a rood rack, but I haven't got any  ski racks yet. Also the tires it came with, are exceptionally good. Michellen MTX L/S, and having put a good 40,000km on the vehicle, tires still good good, with no wear down.

I'd say the only thing I hate about it, is gas. But thats to come with buying any SUV, that you're going to have to put a lot more gas in it (compare to my Protege).

Anyways I would highly recommend this to anyone, I'd guess more for families since it can hold quite a bit, and its also great for long trips, and if you are taking a long trip (eg thru winter, throught rocky mountains) you don't need to worry about getting stuck in snow. I know Mazda stopped making 4x4 after this, and their 2000 MPV is more van, no SUV at all to it. 

This is a great vehicle, and I'll end by saying that the 98 MPV may be expirying soon, since I have seen the new Mazda Tribute, which has taken more of the Sporty SUV style. Hopefully by the end of the year, if my dad wants to, we'll be upgrading once again. Before that tie, I'd like to take the MPV throught some more off-roading to see how it really holds up, and if I do, I'll certainly update this epinion.

-= UPDATE: December 14 2000 =-

Today I got to experience more 4x4 side of the MPV. It snowed a little (but for Vancouver considered a lot) here today. 

There was a fair amount of ice on the roads today, and for the first time, I found out what ABS is.

Sure I knew what it was from the start, and but I just never had to use it. Strange enuf, even tho travelling around 5-10km I was apply the brake when all of a sudden the break pedal started going up and down at a extremely fast rate. I have to say, it scared the living daylights out of me! I didn't know what was going on at first, but when I noticed the other car in front of my sliding from side to side, I noticed I finally came to a nice stop!

Figuring it was ABS, I wanted to try it out more. So I went to my old high school parking lot, where there were no cars to hit, and I started pulling donuts and such for the first time. Its amazing how fun it was in the MPV. And the ABS was absolutly wicked. The snow was only around 2-4 inches, but for any other car, that would cause havoc. I didn't turn on the center diff lock, but I did have 4x4 on, and wow, I had a ton of fun! I was able to make the MPV slide sideways a good way, and even reverse at a fast speed, and spin around and gain control very fast.

Flipping the knob from 2x4 to 4x4 made a big difference, driving in the small streets where the snow as more compact (ie: ice) I never had a problem taking turns without loosing control.

I am totally happy with the MPV in snowy/icy/rainy conditions, and hopefully I'll get to try it in worst conditions, in hilly areas, and gravel/ice roads.

If you have a family, and want a van, that you don't have to worry about getting stuck anywhere, the '98 MPV is a great choice. And you can be sure that you'll get your family home safe and sound.<br><br>
