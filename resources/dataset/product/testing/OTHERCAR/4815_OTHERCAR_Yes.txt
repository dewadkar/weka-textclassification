            I bought my 1993 Pathfinder new when I was a junior in high school.  It was deemed a pretty sweet ride then, and I feel that it still is today.

The amazing thing is that I have put 86,000 miles on it, and it has never needed any work other than scheduled maintenance and a repair of the air conditioner.  The customer service is always excellent when I go in for service in spite of the fact that it is a relatively old car.  Last time I had it serviced, I decided to wait while they performed the work.  It ended up taking about 6 hours, but my service manager contacted me frequently to see if I needed anything.  When she saw me scoping out the vending machine, she offered to have one of the car wash boys run up the road and pick me up something to eat.  The service manager always calls the following day to make sure that I was satisfied with my service visit.

The truck itself is a pleasure to drive.  Nissan did an excellent job designing the interior because even after seven years, it doesn't feel dated or inadequate.  It is simple, functional, and durable.  As far as the exterior design, I personally feel this is still the best looking Pathfinder to date.  I  have the exact car that is shown in the picture above--beautiful.

I have and would definitely recommend the manual transmission which gives the driver more power and better acceleration.  The car is very quiet and has developed no weird rattles or squeaks over the years.

The only complaint I've ever had is that the noise level (from wind turbulence and engine noise) rises significantly over 65 MPH.  I'm sure this is true of most SUV's.

This car was an incredible servant to me over the years.  It got me through high school, college, and law school.  I will be buying a much more exciting car in the coming months--Porsche 911 (that law school was a good idea), but I think I may hang on the my Pathfinder just if I have the occasion to move something, or perhaps to commute in to avoid running up the mileage on my sports car.<br><br>
