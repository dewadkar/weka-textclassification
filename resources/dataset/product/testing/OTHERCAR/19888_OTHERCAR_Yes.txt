            I purchased this camera because I like in the beautiful Rocky Mountains. I was hoping to use it to take pictures of the scenery and wildlife. I found the biggest problems with it to be that it takes 4 AA batteries and when taking a full card of pics, if you use the LCD display the batteries die very quickly. You need to carry one or two spare changes around with you. That can mean a lot of batteries. Around the house it is great. You can plug it in anywhere and take pics all day with it. I have ended up using it mainly for taking pics of my nieces and nephews, and they love to see themselves in the LCD window. I really wouldn't recomend this item for someone who wants it for a vacation or a lot of outdoor use. The cost of the camera plus the batteries make it a very impracticle use for this one. But for anyone who wants it for a memory of children or holidays it is a wonderful easy to use item. Plus you can hook it up to the TV to view any pictures you take. I think it is a very nice little camera for the money you pay, it is just not one you can take anywhere you go.<br><br>
