            After pouring way to much money in my 88 Thunderbird Turbocoupe, which was overall a good car suffering from old age and high mileage; it was time to purchase a new vehicle.

My criteria for purchasing a new car were simple;
1) 4-cylinder turbocharged or supercharged engine.
2) 170-225 hp
3) Manual Transmition
4) Excellent Handling
5) Under $25,000
6) Rear wheel or four-wheel drive
7) Or it had to be a BMW

Not too many cars fit it the top six anymore. The only turbo-super charged cars on the market at the moment, are the Subaru WRX, Mercedes C230, Dodge Neon R/T, or a Saab, just to name a few. I really liked the Subaru WRX, which was running at the top of my list, but the new design is a little on the funky side with the round headlights. Certainly could go for the previous model, but the new model was new, had excellent handling, very good power, and was a manual. The Mercedes was up there also, but with all the desirable options, it ran well over $30,000. Though I loved the interior design, the rear end of the car, from the side, looked like someone chopped of the back of a regular Mercedes. Dodge Neon R/T was just too small and had not hit show rooms yet. And I have seen too many of them flipped on their roof along the highway.  Among other notables, Toyota Corolla S, Excellent looking car, great price...no power whatsoever. Toyota Solaria Convertible, Great looking car, reliable...way to expensive for a Toyota. Though there are others that made my list based on just plain being a nice car, for one reason or another, they got dismissed rather quickly, usually due to reliability issues. The finally criteria was they had to be from a reputable dealer with either the remaining factory warranty or certified pre-owned. All these criteria...so many cars...who made the pick. BMW...what else!!!

Most of my family owns BMW's. Father has a 95-318ti, mother has 84-320i, Brother has 89-525i, Uncle has a 99-540i, and cousin has a 99-M Roadster.  So needless to say, I&#146m very familiar with BMW's. I know all the models, all the engines, all the features, and in general a BMW nut that never owned one, but really wants an 8-series...never happen mostly due to price. Though at first when I was looking at a new car, I dismissed getting one, probably due to the price of the brand new ones, relatively high price of the used ones, and the so called high maintenance costs associated with these cars in general.

Almost by accident, I ran into a local used car dealer where he had a 95 325i convertible, all black, fully loaded, and under $15,000. Almost bought it, until I tried to open the trunk, and it wouldn't open, with the line from the salesman that there was a trick to opening it. There is a trick to opening it.... you hit the button and they lift right up. This wouldn't open at all. In conjunction with the dozen warning lights, from the on-board computer about the rear-tail lights, missing deck emblem, and other little quirks, I concluded that the car was rear-ended and a Car-Fax report confirmed that. But driving the car yielded no issues other than pure fun, especially with the top down.  So this car got me looking at more BMW's...at a reputable dealer.

After hitting Thompson BMW in Doylestown, PA...one of the largest and best dealerships in the area by reputation. I went straight to the older used ones; with hopes of getting one for under $15,000...what I thought I wanted to spend on a BMW. This put me in the 89 to 95 year models. Being with my brother, accidentally ended up in the newer used/certified pre-owned section of the lot. This one car caught my eye immediately; jet-black 323 is. I automatically dismissed this car as being to expensive, without even asking the salesman what it cost.  Being that the larger dealerships tend to not have too many older used cars on the lot, nothing really qualified to my criteria, as most were automatics, came with the standard 90 to 6 months used car warranty, and were not in the best of condition.  I went back that same night with my brother after the dealership closed to look around again, again the black 323is stood out in a lot of newer and expensive 3, 5, Z series cars. Again dismissed as too expensive, never really gave it a second thought.  The next weekend, I hit the same dealership with my brother to see if anything new had arrived. Nothing worth mentioning...but the 99 Jet Black 323is was still there, my brother being a BMW nut, convinced me to take it for a test drive because he wanted to see what a newer E36 3 series was like. I never cared for the E36 body style as I thought they were too boxy, to plain looking. But this car has something different about it. It looked lower, longer, had all the ground effects, including front lip spoilers, side moldings, and nice rims with wide tires. Again, not being interested in spending $30,000 for a car, I had no real intentions other than to see what a newer car was like to drive.  So the salesman let us take it out for a test drive. I was amazed to say the least. Very quick car for a 2.5-liter car had excellent handling, and a nice shifter feel with a softer but still hard compared to the average BMW clutch.  The interior was beautiful all black leather, all the comforts except power seats, and a nice steering wheel with an "M" emblem on it as well as the shifter. So I got my brother to drive it and he was in love also. Up to this point, I still had no idea what the car cost.  Once we got back the salesman quickly took us inside... As much as I know about BMW, I never really heard of the 323 series, with the exception of the classic car of days gone by. TO my knowledge the 3 series consisted of the 318, 325, 328, and M cars. Once inside at the salesman's desk, he quickly quoted a price of $30,500. I laughed in his face. Seeing my reaction, I got the usual lets make a deal. Before I knew it, we were talking in the range of $26,700. Now I know this is typical of how dealerships markup there prices. Well, that price was fairly reasonable for the car and just slightly higher than the "book" value.  The run-down, 1999, 323is, with 33,000 miles on the odometer, sport and premium package, jet black with "M" exterior package, Racing Dynamics front lip spoiler, leather heated seats, "M" interior package, on-board computer, power everything except for the seats, sunroof, fog lights, leather arm-rest and so on. Very nice car. After talking the typical financing stuff, I decided to think about it. And wished the guy a goodnight.  

On the way home, I surely had a smile on my face, I was more than impressed with the car itself. Was it going to be my next new car? After doing my typical research of the model, being that I really didn't know much about the 98-99 323is, I found out some interesting things about it. For starters, this car was going to be the replacement for the 318, as BMW's new policy of no more 4-cylinder cars. My father owns a 318, and quite frankly, how the 323 can be remotely considered a replacement is laughable because it is a far superior car.  Next though its displacement is a 2.5-liter, BMW wanted to distinguish the car from the previous 325, but renumbering its designation to 323.  Next, even though the displacement would indicate that it would have the basic 2.5-liter engine, it in fact is a modified 2.8-liter, sharing most of the engine's components with a modified head.  The fuel system management system, usually designed by Bosh, for most of the BMW line, is in fact designed by Seemans.  What all this means for the average person? Probably nothing at all.  Just interesting facts I guess. But what most people will notice when they first drive the car is the throttle response, likely due to the revamped fuel management system, the use of double variable valve timing, and OBD II engine computer program system.  Being that this car was only manufactured for 2 years makes it somewhat special. The fact that it was also manufactured at the end of the E36 model run, traditionally will make the car one of the most reliable of the model series, as BMW has worked out most of the kinks. The particular model I was interested in, had the Optional Sport Package, consisting of the more obvious, "M" Trim inside such as the sport steering wheel, "M" striped shifter, on the outside, sport alloy wheels with ZR rated tires, and to top if off, a sport tuned suspension, which makes this car kick butt in the turns. A car without the sport package, though respectable, didn&#146t have the fun factor or visual appeal of those that do. Next it has the premium package, which includes to the best of my recollection, fog lights, leather seats, power sunroof, leather arm rest, onboard computer, and leather seats, the later two, I&#146m not sure if these were actually part of the package or just add options.  Also on the car, dual electronic climate control, security-keyless entry system, tape deck, dual airbags, with side impact bags.  All BMW models of the later years have hook up for CD player and car phone. 

The interior overall is a very nice place to be.  The front seats are cozy and firm enough to provide good support on long trips. Seats have nice adjustable headrests, including the back seats. Will seat 5, however for a typical coupe, though roomy in the back, maneuvering to get back there requires a little dance of tuck, turn, twist and sit. But after all it is a coupe.  Dashboard layout is nice, very nice. All controls are where they should be, and easy to reach.  The steering wheel is just a few inches away from the dash, and is not adjustable which is a little different, but the view of the instrument panel is never obstructed. The center console, though a little cluttered, is overall very nicely layed out and makes a nice light show in the dark.  In the shifter area, there are the controls for the windows, heated seats, Active Stability Control, and a little light that shows everyone that the car's security system is armed.  Front seats for some reason are not powered, a little annoying considering what the car costs.  Rear seats fold down giving you some nice area for storage from the trunk. Behind the front seats are net map holders, which look really nice.  Doors have two compartments for storage, but overall there is not much storage...but then again it&#146s not a mini-van.  All seats have 3-point seatbelts.  Onboard computer gives all the driving essential information, fuel range, mileage, outside temperature, check control, timer, and alarm settings; all accessible either from the unit or the turn signal lever.

The doors have a trick to them, where since there is no actual frame around the window, open you open the door handle the window will come down a quarter of an inch to clear all the rubber molding around the door. A feature only the older 8 series has. When you climb in and shut the door, back up it goes, creating a perfect seal. All the windows have 1 touch up or down, if you press the button all the way down.  Also there is a one touch door lock button, probably more useful for the four door and lock all doors, including trunk and fuel door. Heated seats have two levels, put it on high, when they are nice and warm; they automatically switch to the lower level. Personally I think they take a while to warm up. Dual climate control perfect, air conditioning blows like an icebox, the heater is going in almost 2 minutes of driving, when set to 90. You can adjust where you want the hot air to blow when on the automatic setting with a little turn wheel next to the vent. Cruise control system on BMW's is nothing like you'll find on an American car, different place, different operation, but has been used by BMW for over 15 years. Just a matter of getting used to it. Sunroof is powered; either pops the rear up or retracts all together.  Personally I prefer a moon roof. When open under deceleration there is some wind buffeting in the cabin, but remains quite the rest of the time.  Note: do not run the windshield washer with the windows open. You will get fluid in the car. Obviously there is no rail on the roof to redirect water and fluid over the car. The floor mats lock in place by means of a Velcro pad, and never move an inch. Trunk and hood are all hydraulically held in place. The trunk though roomy has the rear window in the way, preventing getting larger objects in the car easily. In the trunk, the full size spare (actual alloy wheel, the same that are on the car) is under a nice trunk mat with rubber straps to prevent objects from sliding around. Overall very nice trunk. 

The control check monitors all head and taillights, turn signals, fluid levels, to name a few and tells you when there is a problem and where to look to fix the problem. The onboard computer in the dash tell you when to service the car and chance the oil based on how you drive, how far you drive, or on a time interval. Since BMW uses high-end synthetic oils, oil change intervals are 12,000 to 15,00 miles. It lets you know just in case you forget anyway.  Service intervals are in relatively long intervals, but cost a nice chunk of change. But all is taken care of, and when the recommended maintenance, these cars last forever. It&#146s not uncommon for them to last 200,000 miles plus. But the premium is not cheap when repairs are required outside of warranty.

So how does it drive? Like it&#146s on rails. Its that good. The handling on the car is awesome.  A combination of all the goodies from the sport suspension, to the all-season traction control, active stability control, anti-lock brakes, 50-50 weight ratio, and Z-rated tires, the car will enter any turn at any speed and stick like it is a true sports car.  The engine has a silky smooth feel to it. It's idle is always constant and very smooth. Put it into first gear; depress the rather soft clutch, and the car launches off, hitting red lines rather quickly and aggressively. In between shifts, The RPMs don&#146t drop very much, making the shift to second very easy.  Here the power curve of the car becomes noticeable. From idle the RPMs rise nicely as to never upset the car or scare the driver. Once on the way at around 3,000 RPMs, the car takes off hitting a jump in the power curve, launching it away at a nice pace. Once again around 5,000 RPMs.the it happens again, all the way up to redline and repeat it all over again in the next shift. This thing could haul way past 150 if not for the governor. At any speed, this car is quite, no wind noise, and always handles what it is given and then some.  Should you make an unlikely mistake, the active stability control steps in and modulates the engine power (and I think the brakes) to get you back under control. With the system off.... get ready to smoke those Z-rated tires on demand. The traction on the car though is awesome...up until you hit some snow, regardless of the amount. Even with the all season traction control, with the sport tires, this car is worthless in the snow. Almost impossible to get it going...once you do though...if you do...it can handle it. But the car stinks in the snow with those tires. Period! With snow or all season tires then its one of the best cars in the white gunk for a rear wheel drive car. But at what they cost from BMW forget it. Have a second car handy for the winter!  

Now the negatives of the car...though there are few. Mentioned earlier, the windsheild wiper fluid enters the car if the windows are open. The pedals of the car are made of less than adequate material...the clutch pedal actually squeaks, nothing that could not be fixed with aftermarket pedals I guess, but for a BMW, hardly acceptable. Some of the interior panels on the lower dash are not of the greatest material either, but are visually pleasing. Under the hood, there is no light, but I guess that&#146s what the rechargeable flashlight in the glove box is for. Plug it in and it is always there when needed.  

Even after all this I was a little hesitant to buy the car, especially since the new E46 model 4-door came out the same year. After test-driving them, I wasn't that impressed, even though I think it is a much better looking, bigger, and more modern looking car. Test-drove an M Roadster also, but with two seats, for a primary car didn't work either. Plus with the top up it&#146s rather tight. Hit my head on the roof rails several times, and that took that car out of the equation. But driving it was a blast.

So needless to say I bought the car for $26,000, which required some wheeling and dealing. After delivery, I got 4 new tires on the car, new floor mats, new battery, inspection II service, new wipers, and fluids. On and on an on. All under the pre-certified warranty of the car. This warranty is a hell of a deal, and better than the new car warranty. Since my car was a lease return, all items requiring repair when the previous owner returned it were fixed, comes with the remaining factory warranty which is 4-years 50,000 miles, and an additional warranty for 2 more years up to 100,000 miles. All in all it was a great deal, for a great car...that&#146s nothing less than a BMW; maybe not the fastest, coolest or most expensive, but a nice stepping stone to getting there.
