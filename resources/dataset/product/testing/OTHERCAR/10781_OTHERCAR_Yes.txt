            This is the ultimate family truckster!  Our family consists of two adults and three children under 5.  Needless to say when we travel, we need the room!  We have owned a Ford Explorer, a GMC Yukon Denali and now the GMC Suburban.  We had no complaints about the Explorer or Denali other than the lack of the third row of seats.  We have taken the Suburban on numerous road trips since its purchase and could not be more pleased with the ride and room.  We are able to arrange the seats so that our toddlers can sit in their booster seats in the third row.  We are then able to fold down two-thirds of the middle row and have our youngest in her rear facing car seat sit in the seat that remains.  We then are able to put a cooler on the folded down seats that easy for anyone to reach. We have yet to fill the Suburban to the top while we travel.

What also makes the Suburban nice is that we can still accommodate two additional adults to ride with us when the occasion arises.  No need to follow another vehicle around with this truck.  It lives up to the quality GMC name.

The only draw back we have found to the Suburban is an obvious one, it uses quite a bit of gas.  We joke about docking it and taking a walk while we fill it up.  Overall, though for the type of driving we do it really has not costs us much more in gas.  It gets great mileage on trips for its size and during the week while I drive it around town I usually only have to fill it up once every three to four weeks.

Anyone looking to purchase a full-size SUV should definitely test drive a Suburban.<br><br>
