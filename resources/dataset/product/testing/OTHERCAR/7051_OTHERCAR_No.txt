            Before I leased my Mazda 626 LX V6 in 1994, I rented it for several weekends over 4 months from Enterprise Rent-a-Car.  All the cars I drove during that time, were fabulous!  Unfortunately, they were nothing like the car I leased.  It HAD to be a LEMON!  It was beautiful, BUT it pinged, it knocked, it stalled, it idled very high, the engine cycled, the transmission slipped, the muffler rattled, and the stereo blinked in and out!  

I called, and called, and called the dealership.  I took the car to the dealership an average of every three months for four years.  The dealership assured me there was absolutely nothing wrong with my car.  I told the dealership I would do the minimum required maintenance to abide by the lease and nothing more.  I told them I hoped they would have to pick it up via tow When the lease was up.  And it was almost that bad.  I completed my mileage maximum with a year left in the lease.  Because I was so upset at the lack of help from the Mazda Corporation, I let it sit and rot in my driveway for the next year while I drove my other car.

I happened to accidentally leave some personal information like my name and phone number in the glove box in the 626 manual.  A woman who was seriously considering buying the car called me.  I told her all the problems with the car.  Her dealership had told her there were never any service problems with the car.  Bastards.

I have had many makes of cars over the years, domestic and imports.  I will never buy anything but a Toyota/Lexus ever again.  Two words describe this company in every way... NO PROBLEMS!
