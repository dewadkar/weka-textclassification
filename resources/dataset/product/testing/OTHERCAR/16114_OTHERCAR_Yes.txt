            Recently I just purchased a 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee and after 4 months I could't be happier.  Jeeps have come a long way in the past few years and now a revamped Grand Cherokee with a powerful 5.9 liter engine and a new body style is on the prowl.  There are many new options that set the Grand Cherokee apart from other SUV's in its class.  From the onboard computer that speaks 5 languages (along with doing a handful of other functions), to the 6 speaker Infinity speaker system (that is out of sight), to the radio/cd controls on the back of the wheel its loaded.  Option packages include leather, towing packages, sunroof, digital dual climate control, power seats and much more.  From top to bottom this Jeep is solid.  If you need a tough Offroad Vehicle its all new 4 wheel drive system is powerful and easy to use.  On the highway the Grand Cherokee is as smooth as a expensive sedan and roomy enough for a family of 5 and their luggage to be comfortable on any length road trip.  <br><br>
