              Yes, I live the good life! I own 2 cars. Not that they're like really good, but I always figured that two crappy cars equal one good one anyway!
This car which is an 84 Cutlass Ciera has been in my family since it was new. My parents bought it. After years of faithful sevice, they bought a new car, and gave me the Ciera. I LOVE this car! Not just because it's a nice car, but because it was a gift from my parents :)

  Why do I love this car so much? Well, the seats are really comfortable, the thing has a great motor and it's reliable as long as you know how to handle it. It's a very quirky car. I think it has a personality all it's own. The car has held up very well over the years. Mainly because my parents babied the car the whole time they owned it. After 16 years of Ohio winters and road salt, it's just now starting to rust through. Everything on the car is original and I have to say for what it's been through, it's in really good shape. It's just starting to look a bit wailed on.

  The car smells like a dirty sock,it leaks water through the floor boards, and the passenger seat is starting to fall through the bottom, but the thing still runs great. No major problems over the years either. The way the car is going, the car will still be running years from now, and the body will dematerialize and disintegrate on the freeway.
  I'll probably have the motor put in a newer body. It's that good!
