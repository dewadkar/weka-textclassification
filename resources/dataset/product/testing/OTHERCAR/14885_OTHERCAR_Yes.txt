            We have owned the FD-71 for about 5 months &amp; love it.  We hardly use our 35mm any more.  This is a great camera.  The view screen in the back is great &amp; very clear.  There alot of options about the quality of picture you are taking and saving to disk....disk - yes, this camera uses a floppy!  There are no messy wires to hook up to your computer to view your pics nor is there a memory stick.  All you need are floppys.  It is easy to pack &amp; travel with &amp; you never run out of film &amp; you can immediately view &amp; e-mail your pictures on-line!  Life is getting much easier!<br><br>
