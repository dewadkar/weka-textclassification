            For those of us who refuse to join the ranks of owning a family van, the Honda CRV is the perfect alternative.  It's roomy with plenty of storage for families on the go.  It's versatile.  Need to stop for lunch?  Pull out the picnic table in the back and grab a sandwich and a cold drink from the built-in cooler.  Too tired to travel any further?  Stop at the next rest area, remove head rests and recline all the seats for an instant bed.

The Honda CRV offers a firm ride, it's easy to maneuver and it's fun to drive.  The all-wheel-drive feature is an added bonus and makes driving in the snow almost a breeze.

The Honda CRV is a practical choice for small families with 1-2 children.  My suggestions to Honda for improving the vehicle would be to upgrade the sound system and to move the rear door hatch release on the front dash to a more easily accessible location.

To put it in the words of a friend of mine &quot;Honda's got it going on!&quot;<br><br>
