            I loved my last car- it was a beat up '87 Honda Accord. I had to get rid of it finally because the cost of repairs was getting out of hand and I'm pretty sure the engine was in decline. The point is, I LOVED that car. 

My shopping experience started with me looking at good used cars. I looked at some used SUVs and really wanted to find a used Accord wagon in good condition. I had no luck. So I decided to look into what I could afford in a new car. To make a long story short (too late!) I settled on the 1999 Honda Civic Hatchback in silver with the only amenity being an air conditioner as I reside in Texas. I don't love this car. Don't get me wrong- I like this car a whole heck of a lot- but it's not love. The longer I own this car the more character it will develop and I am sure love won't be all that far off.

The car itself runs so efficiently it amazes me. I fill up the gas tank once every 10 days or so. I get about 250 miles to the tank- and it's a small tank. That is mostly in city miles. I have yet to take this car on a long car trip, but I'm sure it will squeeze out another 50 miles per tank with ease. I find that the car lacks the pick up that I was accustomed to with my previous vehicle. At times I have to shut the A/C off temporarily so I can gun it across an intersection. It's kind of comical- it feels like I'm igniting the rocket boosters when I have to do this. The air conditioner works fairly well. It never gets overly cold but it does work as well as it needs to. One odd thing about the ventilation system in my car is when the A/C is off sometimes I get clouds of condensation coming through the vents. It scared the heck out of me the first time it happened. It happens fairly infrequently and only when the A/C isn't on and I've been idling at a stop light or a stop sign. 

I'm glad I chose the hatchback version of the Civic. It is very roomy and I can pack it full of stuff more so than I would have been able to in the 2 or 4 door versions. It also looks pretty sporty as well. 
I don't foresee this car having any problems for a few years. It is very reliable. That is why I chose it in the first place. I would recommend this car to anyone who has a limited budget and wants a car that they don't have to worry about. <br><br>
