            I was first exposed to this great camera a few months ago when my aunt was visiting from Florida.  She had just bought this camera and was like a little kid showing us a new toy.  After a few minutes, I realized why.  I had never planned on owning a digital camera before seeing this one.  The technology never really impressed me, and the cameras that I saw weren't that great.  It just seemed like a passing trend to me.  A few years and I'd be stuck with an outdated $500 camera that I would not use anymore.  Boy was that a misconception!  

I can't begin to tell you how much fun you'll have with this camera.  I have taken more pictures in the last week than I have ever taken in my life, and I'm having an absolute blast.  

The camera is laid out in a very interesting yet logical manner.  There is a 2" "Flip-and-fold" LCD screen in the back along with a few buttons.  You have the power button, the zoom button, a 5-way directional pad/button, along with about 3 other feature buttons.  

This camera is simple enough for first-time users and feature-packed enough for hardcore digital photographers.  You can choose to simply switch it on, point, shoot, and download the images to your PC without adjusting a thing, and the camera will handle the rest.  However, for more control-demanding people like me, there are a ton of things to play with!  You can adjust picture size, compression format, lighting effects, white balance, the list goes on!  All of these features are packed into an innovative menu system navigated via the directional pad.  After a few minutes of using this system, you'll wonder why it hasn't been used before!  

After taking pictures you can view them directly from the camera via the "play" mode selectable from a switch at the top of the camera.  This mode can be used to view individual pictures or even to play a slide-show style presentation of your pictures.  There is even a handy index view that allows you to see up to six pictures at one time.  Find a picture you don't want?  Delete it, you won't have to see it anymore!  Try that with a 35mm!  

Moving pictures from the camera to your PC is very people-oriented.  You simply run the included USB cable from the camera to your PC.  This creates a removable drive in "My Computer" that functions as any folder would.  You simply drag files in and out of it.  No complex and fussy software to play with as with some cameras.  And thanks to the USB interface, it's quick!  

The picture quality is nothing short of amazing!  They are sharp, clear, and vivid.  If you happen to have a newer printer, I suggest buying some glossy photo paper, you won't regret the results.  Suddenly, I can print out studio-quality pictures without leaving my office!  The image quality is amazing, and Sony should be heralded for it.

My only complaint as far as the images go, however, is that unless you are holding the camera extremely still, the image will blur.  This doesn't happen often, and thanks to the ability to view the picture you just took, you can just delete it and take another in seconds.  However, this is probably just a matter of getting used to taking pictures using this camera.

The LCD screen on this camera is a wonderfull treat.  It is bright and crystal-clear from many angles!  After playing with the "TV Mode" feature - a feature that enables you to connect your camera to your TV with an included video cable - I realized that the 2" LCD screen looked better than my TV does!  It is that nice, and you won't be dissapointed with it.  I was skeptical of the whole "flip-and-fold" feature, thinking that it might break easlily or be flimsy, but it feels solid and strong - this isn't going to break any time soon!

Time to re-charge?  Just plug in the A/C power cord and let it sit for an hour or so.  The small battery included is amazing!  After a charge, you get over 2 1/2 hours of use!  That's just nuts!  Unless you plan on using your camera to take 500 pictures in a half-hour period, this camera will last all day.  At night, just plug it in and it'll be ready for more pictures when you are!

This camera comes complete with a lens-cover, carrying strap, battery, and a 4MB memory stick.  However, I recommend purchasing at least a 32MB memory stick.  The 4MB one is fine, but will only hold about 9 - 10 high quality images at a time.  The 32MB model will hold as much as 80.  Just something to consider.

I bought this camera from www.etronics.com and it cost $479.95.  This may seem staggering at first, but let me try to explain something to you.  Think about the cost of your current camera.  Now think about the cost and hassle of film.  Again, think about how many times you end up taking 10 pictures you know you won't use just to get rid of a roll of film so you can get it developed.  Speaking of developing, it's getting more expensive by the day!  Not to mention the fact that you can print out a full 8 1/2 x 11 inch photo without having to make a special order for it.  I think you get where I'm going with this.  Bottom line, this camera is a GREAT VALUE!!!

All said, I can't recommend this camera enough.  Even if you don't think you need a digital camera, you don't know what you're missing.
