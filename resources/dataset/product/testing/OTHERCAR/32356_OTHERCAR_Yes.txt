            I acquired my 1995 Jetta GLS  through my parents as my first car.  While I was really wanting to hold out for my '67 Beetle to be restored (and it still hasn't been), I wasn't about to turn down a Jetta.  My father is a car dealer, and he got mine for a great deal almost by accident.  Since I started driving it, the car has been mechanically sound, handles well, and looks great.  The Jetta had been in an collision before we got it, so it was full of dings and dents, but it still looked decent.  It's a 5 speed manual, and shifts beautifully.  As a car dealer's daughter, I drive a lot of cars, and I have to say that the Jettas are probably the nicest manual to drive.  I cannot say enough about how much I adore the car, but it is full of little quirks.  The lock system of the 95 Jettas is wonderful.  I can't say how much I appreciate not being able to lock my keys in the car!  However, the vacuum has gone out on it a couple of times, and I've had to replace a motor.  At one point, we had to take the entire rear driver side door apart just so we could unlock the door!  The intermittant wiper timer had to be replaced.  It would wipe for a few seconds, stop wiping, and then it would begin wiping furiously and not shut off.  My cruise control no longer works, and we've had to replace the rear defroster button a couple times.  Don't get me wrong, the good in this car far outweighs the bad.  The car is easy to work on, and I can do most of the work myself.  Although 1995 Jettas are only published to get about 23 mpg in city driving, I have 23 to be the low end.  I drive mine hard and have gotten as high as 30 in the city, and average about 33-35 mpg on the freeway.  The mileage is over 100,000 and mechanically, all it has required is fluid changes and filter changes.  I have seen Jettas come through the dealership with over 130,000 and still going strong.  We get a lot of rain and snow where I live, and it handles flawlessly in bad weather.  It is a very ideal student car, as it is spacious.  I can throw all of my books, bags, and other oddities in the backseat or in the trunk.  The price of these cars is now low enough that they make an ideal first car for a student, though I would advise checking all of the electrical thoroughly before you purchase!
