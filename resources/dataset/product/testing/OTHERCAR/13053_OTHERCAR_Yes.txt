            This was my �baby�. The most fun car I�ve ever driven. A black convertible 1991 Mazda RX7.

It was an accident (or maybe faith?) when I bought my first RX7. It was a 1986 brown hatchback. At that time I needed a cheap car and some guy was selling it for $1,000. Since I knew the owner through a friend of mine and I really fell in love with the way it looks, I took it for a spin one night and then�. the next day I bought it.

My very first impression, as someone who never climbed into an RX7 before was that it was very low (duh). My next thing was adjusting to the way it steers. This particular model had no power steering so I had to use both hands every time I parked it. Adjusting to the stick shift was no problem at all, I drove stick shift cars all my life. The stick was very short but it shifted very easily. I was surprised by the amount of leg room I had in that car and by the amount of space in the hatch. The car handled extraordinarily. I looked at the  dials and noticed that the �red zone� on the tachometer starts at 8,000 rpms, this is something unusual. I fell in love with the dashboard. Very clean, in the dark it barely distracts you, the orange lighting gives it the feel of an airplane dashboard.

The next day however I brought the car back complaining to the previous owner that there is something very wrong with the suspension, that I could feel every single tiny bump in the road.  He smiled, and told me that this is a way a sports car should feel. When I bought it, the car had over 100,000 miles on board, but I did my homework and read that these cars last forever.

I bought books, I read everything there was about the RX7. Since I am an aviation engineer by education, I knew quite a few things about the rotary engine that equipped my car since the rotary engine (or the Wankel engine) was used on small planes and it�s principles are very well know in the aviation circles. I was becoming an addict. The car became an ice breaker and a frequent conversation topic. I was anxiously waiting for someone to ask me �how many cylinders� so I can put my RX7 smile on my face and answer �zero�.

At 132,000 miles I blew the engine up. Everywhere I would go to fix it they would ask me for several thousands to �rebuild� it. It�s the curse of the RX7, most of the repair people look at you like you just fell of the face of Venus � �uhhh, Charlie, come over here, what is this contraption?�. The people who know how to fix it also know that they are ones of the very few who know how to fix it so they charge you more than it�s probably worth. I couldn�t sell a car with no engine either so I pushed it outside my garage and left it on the street so I can use the garage for a borrowed car. The cops towed it for all my unpaid tickets. I let them sell it, I even got money back after my tickets were paid. I feel sorry for the guy who got it, the way they do those auctions is you see, you buy, then you get the keys.

I saw an ad in a paper. Someone was selling a �triple black� 1991 convertible RX7 for $11,000. I did not have the money but I wanted it badly. I called the guy after a few days of balancing reason and wildness (wildness won, by the way) but he sold the car to a dealer. Traced the dealer, got a loan, got the car. Just like that, no testing, nothing. Stupid? Perhaps so. But I did not want to deal with the dealer too much, the place was too shady, I saw a couple of people buying black BMWs on the spot, with briefcases full of money. I was wandering what exactly am I doing in such a place.

The car was dusty and dirty. The dealer took it for a spin over the weekend and didn�t bother washing it. I didn�t insist, just wanted to get out of there. I got lucky, everything worked, the engine sounded perfect, the clutch was new, the transmission was tight, nothing was leaking. It was a dream come true. My very first convertible.

<b>What�s so special about this car</b>

Because of the motorized top, you can�t move the seats as far back as in the hatchback version. Leg room is no more..

The trunk is very small and it can barely accommodate 2 carry-ons.

The top is extremely well designed. The roof is hard (I was never too comfortable in soft roof cars, what if an icicle falls right on your car - you�re dead). The rear window is made of glass and it has a defrost/defog system (cool).

You can take the hardtop off and transform the car into a targa. Great look.

The sound system (factory installed original) is incredible. The headrests in the leather seats have speakers. You can individually control the volume in each headrest. There is a surround button that produces an amazing effect. You can really listen to music with the top down, cruising at high speed on a highway.

The heater is more powerful that on the standard version, you can drive in cold weather with the top down and the flow of hot air will keep you warm.

They don�t make this particular model in a turbo version (I still don�t know why). Although the engine is not as powerful as on other sports cars, because of its design and high rotation speeds, the car is very fast.

<b>What�s not so special about this car</b>

You really have to love this car. It will love you back! If you don�t, get a Mustang or a Vette. Frequent oil change is a must. Good tune-up is a must. Sparkplugs are special and expensive.

Eats a lot of gas. But then again, when�s the last time you heard a Corvette owner telling you �well, I bought this car for it�s low fuel consumption�.

Can�t park this car on grass, especially after a long ride. The catalytic system heats up a lot and the car is very low. You might risk a fire.

<b>Conclusion</b>

Overall, if you really love the true meaning of a �sports car�, this one is special. Too bad they don�t make them anymore.
