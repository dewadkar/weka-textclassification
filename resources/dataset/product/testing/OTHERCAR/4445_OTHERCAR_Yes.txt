            When you ride in the CL, the first thing you notice is the acceleration.  The smooth growl of the engine, the feeling of being pushed back in your seat.  That's when I realized that the CL is a true luxury sports car.

When I first saw the CL, I wasn't sure what Acura was thinking when they designed it.  The front is ALL good, but flip side 180 degrees, and your facing the back.  Its been described as <i>distinctive</i> but I don't really like it.  But even with the drawback of the truck shape, the 1997 CL is a good looking car, if not great.

The performance for the CL is exceptional. Like I said before, the acceleration is pure joy.  And it performs and handles well just driving city streets.  Responsive breaking, etc.  But I'm sure that its true soul only comes out on the race track, which I am looking forward to experiencing if my friend lets me.

For a coupe, the CL has lots of headroom and legroom in the back.  Its fairly easy to get in and out for the back passengers.  The front is even more comfortable, especially when your not driving and can lay back and enjoy the ride.

So if you're on the market for a sports coupe, consider the 1997 Acura CL.  With great handling and power, as well as good saftey, its a very competitive used car.<br><br>
