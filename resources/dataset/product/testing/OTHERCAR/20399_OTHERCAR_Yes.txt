            The Soccer season was not even over when two of my buddies and I started making plans to hit the mountains to do some skiing.  There was one anomaly this year.  It was not snowing in the Sierra Summit.  So we had to wait until Mother Nature became generous to us a few weeks ago.  Finally, the snow slopes were open.  And we were ready to execute our plans this year.  Call it a guys' stuff.  We wanted to do some cross country, back-country skiing in the Sierra mountains.  I will not hide my beginner's status.  The other guys grew up in this environment and knew what to expect.  So they wanted to give me a lesson out there.  But I know I can make them pay back on the soccer field any way.  Cross-country skiing is something I have always wanted to do.  I just seized the opportunity to participate with them.

<b>2001 VW Golf GTi GLS on the way to the ski area</b>

As I refused to drive in the snow country in this vehicle, I volunteered to drive from the Central Valley up to Oakhurst, a thriving community in the foothills.  At that point, the real owner of the VW Golf would take over.  On the way up, I could see how some fellow commuters or skiers looked at our Golf.  I am still not sure whether they were paying more attention to our skis or the vehicle.  As for Ryan, the vehicle's owner, it was the 2001 Golf without any doubt.

<b>Just like the Beetle, the Golf turned heads in its own way</b>

The 2001 Golf is like a rocket on the road.  I remember making my buddies laugh when I lost a teenage driver listening to loud music at a stop light.  He was looking at us while tapping on the steering wheel of his Honda Civic with a loud muffler.  The last time I looked into my rear view mirror, he was barely leaving the light.  The owner of the Golf warned that I'd be caught by a highway patrol.  "I was not speeding," I responded.  "You and your lead foot," he added.  <i>The Golf is a 150-horsepower, 1.8-liter turbocharged engine.  As long as it's not in the mountains, the Golf is like a rocket beating most cars in its category.  I still don't know why my wife did not pick it when we went out to test vehicles last year.  She preferred the familiar Honda Civic instead.</i>

<b>What have I observed while being at the steering wheel?</b>

<i>Safety Features are important to me</i>

If anybody wants to be different, he/she can go with the Golf.  Far too many people are just going after the Beetle these days.  They just don't know how satisfied they could be with this Golf.  In my view, you will get more for your money.  After all, it's the same vehicle without the Beetle look.  I also test-drove a few Beetles.  I enjoyed the fact that I could see all around me.  I did not observe any blind spots.  The 4-speed automatic Golf I was driving is truly an engineering feast.  It's appealing and sturdy.  I can understand why some female acquaintances are attracted to it.

If you are concerned about features, you have all the standard features plus front and side-air bags.  The Golf has four wheel anti-lock brakes.  Then, you can have some additional options:  Cold weather package, luxury package, and Monsoon sound system.  The stop is pretty smooth.  It takes very well. 

* For the first 2 years or 24,000 miles, you will receive regularly scheduled maintenance

*  You will also have powertrain warranty for 10 years or 10,000 miles.

*  You can adjust your seat to your height.

*  Great gas mileage City/Hwy:  24/31 mpg

Take into account all the features listed above and more when you are ready to purchase a reliable, small car for your transportation.
