            The Polaroid PDC640 is a very good camera if you're just making the change to digital cameras, or if you want to send pictures in email and post on a website. It took me less than an hour of reading the manual and taking practice shots to get up and running with this camera. 

The LCD screen on the top of the camera keeps you informed of several key facts such as - what resolution you're using, flash mode, how much memory is left and battery life remaining.

Flash choices are normal, red-eye reduction and no flash. You can choose from very low resolution pictures to squeeze more out of the memory card, or go for the higher resolution (less grainy) if you like. It's nice to have a choice between low resolution, web quality pictures, and the higher resolution shots to send along to a developer. 

The view finder on the back of the camera is excellent and I love the live-panning option which allows you to frame your picture perfectly. Want to include yourself in that family picture? The self-timer gives you enough time to run over and fit into that group shot. All of the functions, such as Review and Delete are easy to understand and use. But, like anything else, it's a good idea to run through all of these in a practice session while reading the manual.   

I am glad that I got the SmartDisk adapter, which is a 1.44 sized diskette the SmartMedia memory card fits into giving you instant access to the pictures. It made the total cost more - by a $100, but it was well worth it to me in time and frustration savings. I'm not one to let loose wires hang off of anything, much less a computer, and I didn't relish the idea of plugging in a cable every time I wanted to download pictures from the camera. The SmartDisk adapter solves that problem perfectly for me. 

Of course if you don't mind plugging in the cable and letting it sit, then you can do without the SmartDisk adapter, keeping the cost of the camera down and still get the same functionality.
