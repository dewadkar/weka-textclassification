            For a year and a half, I drove a used 1995 BMW 325i. In January 2000, as the odometer tipped 102,000 miles on my current car and a bunch of little things started to go wrong that were going to add up to more than $1,000 in repairs, I looked toward getting a new car. 

I wanted to stay with BMW, but my choices weren't clear: I needed to stay at or very near $30,000 -- which in this particular car line, doesn't take you very far. There was a possibility of getting a 1997 528i, but the ones in my price range had very high mileage. I could also get a pre-owned 3 series, but even the 1997 and 1998 models were up near $30,000 themselves. I figured I was basically out of luck, until I picked up one of those &quot;new car review&quot; maagazines in the bookstore one night, and saw that the base price of a new 2000 BMW 323i was only $26,000 and change. This changed my thinking entirely.

What I found was that with many of the cars I had been looking at were optioned out to the gills, which drove up their selling price considerably. When I priced out the car I *wanted*, with only the options I wanted, I suddenly found myself in a price range I could afford:

A 2000 BMW 323i in jet black, with a sand &quot;leatherette&quot; interior (leatherette is just a fancy word for vinyl), automatic transmission, cruise control, navigation system, and fog lights, retailed for $31,670. I ordered my car in January 2000 and took delivery in March. I haven't regretted the decision at all.

Even without the sport suspension, the car handles beautifully. In its latest revision, the 3-series has lost some of the edge it used to have, but that edge has been replaced by a feeling of overall balance and maturity that fits the image of the car nicely. BMW has retained the aggressive looks and has improved upon the overall design of the car, making the best small sports sedan even better. The 2.5 liter engine in the 323 provides plenty of power without seeming overwhelming, and while the sedan lacks some of the &quot;pocket rocket&quot; feel of the 3-series coupe, for someone with a family and/or someone looking for a car they can drive comfortably in traffic, on the highway, and on long trips, it's a perfect choice.

There are, of course, some quirks and odd features to the car. Most notably, by not purchasing the Premium Package I do not have power seats in the front. Also, there is no button inside the car to open the trunk -- I have to use a button on the key to open the trunk remotely. A base-model 323/325 also lacks some of the interior trim features of their more expensive brethren, as well as the &quot;upgraded&quot; interior lighting (footwell lights, map lights, etc.). On the plus side, *all* new BMW's come with 3 years of scheduled maintenance included, which basically covers 1 oil change and one &quot;inspection&quot; at around 30,000 miles. Air conditioning, power windows, power locks, tilt wheel, and a slew of selectable settings are all included in the price of the car, though in the 2001 325i the climate controls are *manual*, not digital (or &quot;automatic&quot;) if you don't purchase the premium package.

Also for 2001, BMW has made purchase of the Premium Package (about $3500) mandatory in order to get the navigation system (this wasn't necessary in 2000)for silly reasons I won't get into here (okay, fine - it's because the &quot;manual&quot; climate controls won't fit in the area they have to be moved to in order to make room for the nav system. Therefore, you have to have the digital climate controls, which, of course, are only available in the Premium Package. I told you it was silly). 

When driving a BMW, I always get the feeling that while the car may not have the most luxurious interior, the most technological gadgets, or include the most features for the price, I know that the $30,000 I spent is almost all under the hood and behind the body panels. And I'm perfectly OK with that.

A fully optioned-out 323i/325i can cost over $40,000 if you get a convertible with all the bells and whistles. But you can spend more than $10,000 less, and still enjoy the experience of an Ultimate Driving Machine. If you're looking at a vehicle costing around $30,000 you owe yourself a test drive.<br><br>
