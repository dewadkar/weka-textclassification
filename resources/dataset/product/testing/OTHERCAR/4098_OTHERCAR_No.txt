            SHORT TERM:  The Intrigue was a sharp looking, comfortable car when we first looked at it and decided to buy it.  It handled like a dream around curves and it accelerated well.  The engine was a tested engine that had been around for years so we trusted it.  It fit the &quot;It's not your Grandpa's Oldsmobile&quot;.  We really enjoyed it until we got it off the lot.

LONG TERM:  The car started giving us problems twenty minutes after we drove off the lot.  It had 120 miles on it, but that car must have had a hard 120 miles.  We owned the car for 11 months.  Here is the list of problems we had with it.

1.  Dash cluster whet bad.
2.  Short in ignition wiring causing car to not start one day.
3.  ABS went out, faulty equipment.
4.  Front end was unable to be aligned due to bent suspension (happened in that 120 miles before we received it)
5.  Left front tire blew out for no reason at 20 mph.
6.  Wheel bearing bad.
7.  Computer module bad, cause car to beep and buzz non stop until replaced.
8.  Tires bald after 18,000 miles.
9.  Brakes warped.
10. Drivers door kept coming out of alignment.
11. Transmission began slipping.

DRIVE:  Granted, I don't think our car is typical of all Intrigues, but the car always acted like it was being thrown around by a heavy wind, even on the calmest days (due to bent suspension?)  You could not drive this car in snow and rain.  I have never in my life had a car fishtailing on wet pavement for no reason.  The car would pull to one side or the other constantly.  It was unsafe on wet and snow covered roads.  On dry roads, if you could get past the blown around feeling, it handled well.  It loved curves.  It took off with vigor and I know I always left people at the stop line.  Plenty of power.

INTERIOR:  The interior of the car was really high quality in comparison with other cars of this price range.  It is comfortable and does not rattle.  If feels sturdy.

EXTERIOR:  Sharp looking car.

OVERALL:  I honestly hated this car.  I would fear for my life if I had to drive it and the roads were not dry (and I grew up in the snow belt of northern Michigan so I know how to drive on bad roads).  The repair shop would took at least three tries to fix every problem, thus we decided to never buy a GM car again (again, we are from Michigan so I grew up think only buy American.)  I think if someone were to get a non lemon car, they may enjoy it, but we could not.<br><br>
