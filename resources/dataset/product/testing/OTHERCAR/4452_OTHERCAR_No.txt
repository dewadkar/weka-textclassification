            It's  a sorority girl's car.  No matter how much you want to like it,  it still comes across as a sorority girl's car.  "Cute" is the most common word used to describe the Cabrio's styling.  The 2000 Cabrio has its roots in the old VW Rabbit and it's obvious, frankly that was a girl's car too.  Styling aside the Cabrio does many things well, and a few things very poorly.

Inside the Cabrio you'll find small buttons and switches, all the same size with only a universal symbol on each to tell you what it does.  It's typically German.  Speaking of German, who else would put BLACK LEATHER seats in a convertible, OUCH !!  Anyway, once the key is put in the ignition, out comes the most irritating sound ever.  Instead of a chime or a ding, the Cabrio plays some tune that sounds as if it were borrowed from an 80's hand held video game.  At first it seems cute, but after a few days it gets downright annoying.  Cabrio seats are hard as plywood, but not terribly uncomfortable.  The manual height adjustment on the driver seat is a great idea.  The stereo sounds good, but lacks bass.  Cup holders are good for cans only.  Gauges are well placed and easy to read.  At night the dash lights up in blue - very cool.  The top is power and is very easy to operate.

On the road the Cabrio is a mixture of new and old.  With the top up, the Cabrio is most likely the quietest convertible in its class.  With the top down, wind noise is acceptable but there is way too much cowl shake.  It's common in convertibles, but on this specific car, it is worse than most.  The Cabrio is as shaky on rough roads as a FIAT 124, and yet overall is so very smooth.  Speaking of FIAT, the Cabrio is one car an old FIAT could beat in a drag race with no problem.  Don't get me wrong, I love those old FIAT's (I had an '81 Spider), but they were not super fast in a straight line.  Same is true for the Cabrio, only the Cabrio is much newer, and costs $25,000.  That old FIAT is looking like more and more of a bargain.  With only 115 hp, the Cabrio has its work cut out for it.  Compare to a Miata which has 140 hp, is lighter and less expensive.  Also the gearing of the Cabrio 5-speed is more suited for the Autobahn, than the typical suburban streets, most of the power and torque live above 3000 RPM.  That means fun on the open road, but a hassle in traffic.  

The main advantage a car like the Cabrio has over the Miatas of the world is usefulness.  It would be possible to have a Cabrio as your only car, and not be miserable.  You won't get many groceries in the trunk of a Miata, and you won't get anyone or anything is the back seat of a Miata - it doesn't have one.  The Cabrio on the other hand has a surprisingly large trunk, even with the top down and two short adults could ride in the back seat. After all, your sorority sisters are probably well under 6ft tall.

Overall the Volkswagen Cabrio does some things very well, and some things very poorly.  A smooth ride, quiet cabin, and everyday usefulness are the Cabrio's strong points.  Underpowered, overpriced and an aging platform are its weak points.  Many will be drawn to the  car for its styling.  If you just must have a Cabrio, you'll probably be happy with it.  However, if you are shopping for a good, sporty convertible,  there are better choices.  Check out Honda's S2000 or the Mazda Miata, they are both a better value and no one will say you're driving a girls car.
