            This is the newest camera in many respects. At first, it has 4-megapixel matrix, and secondly, it is first specially developed, as the digital mirror camera, with a possibility of a manual focussing on a dim screen. The camera looks very solidly, both on weight. In common, serious camera, and serious approach. The camera is equipped optics with a 4-multiple modification of a focal length, 9-36 mm, and with an effective relative orifice 1:2 - 1:2,4.

The modification of a focal length is made manually - turn of a ring, on which rim the significances of a focal length are put. The similar construction of a modification of a focal length is looks to me very convenient. But is not present in the world of perfection, and the standard remote control panel delivered together with the camera, can not operated focal length. Turning LCD screen can be used and as the range finder, the truth, on it is observed some stripes. Especially it does not hinder, but...

The most part of operations with the camera is carried out with the help of of buttons and switches on body. The functions of the menu intuitively are clear, except for represented on a screen 3/3. It, as is become clear on a perusal of the instruction, - loudness of imitation of work of a lock and loudness of preventive signals. To the camera is applied the instruction for the user on 204 pages. 

The information about parameters of shooting is visible both on LCD screen, and in the optical range finder. It is possible to receive and almost comprehensive information about the already shooted frame.

The manual focussing is carried out rotation of a ring on optics, which, however, not directly mechanically moves lenses, and includes the motor drive. Therefore on this ring instead of metric area only 2 significances: "closer" - "farther". 

Possibilities of saving rather rich: it is possible to use as SmartMedia, so CompactFlash type 2, truth with IBM, probably, have not agreed, therefore work with IBM Microdrive is not guaranteed.

The universality does not limit by memory, similar approach and to a battery. The module for batteries has a rather artful construction and allows using both firm CR-V3, and standard batteries of a size ��.
