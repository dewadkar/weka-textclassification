            I bought my 1993 Prizm (Geo) because our family of 3 would be traveling 6 months out of the year, every weekend..184 miles...economics was a big factor.  This car has proven it's self!  It is great on gas..about 28 miles on the highway.  It has good pick-up for a compact car.  The maintenance has been, in my estimate, average.  It has over 72,000 miles on it.  It has had three batteries (one was a bad battery.), two alternators and one starter.  

Besides the gas mileage, it has a very spacious trunk.  The front wheel drive has gotten me through many a snow storm.  I won't take it out after 5 inches of snow has accumulated, but it will make it through 4 inches of snow with a reasonably sane driver.  The sound system is decent.  What I don't like about the car, is the back seat is not comfortable for anybody over the age of 14.  The ride is OK, but with a compact car the back seat just isn't that roomy.

This car handles well on winding, mountainous roads.  It also does well on the interstate and city driving.  

This is not a family car, but is good for the commuter, student and couples.  I love it and would buy another one.<br><br>
