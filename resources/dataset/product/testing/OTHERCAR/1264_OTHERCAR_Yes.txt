            It is clear that the Nikon tradition continues as this camera takes INCREDIBLE pictures!!  The USB interface worked flawlessly with my desktop PC but failed to install on my Dell Laptop.  While customer service line was no help, I am sure that the software glich will be solved shortly.  In the mean time, I have staved off this problem by purchasing the EC-AD1 PC Card Adapter ($29.00).  Pop it in, move the file to a desktop folder (extremely fast transfer!), drag the Nikon folder (from the flash memory) into the trash, select the icon to turn it off, pop it out and back into the camera and your off again. I can manage this all in 30 seconds or less!

Don't be fooled. This powerful camera will take time to learn to utilize all its features, but, out of the box, it will take magnificent, balanced, full color pictures that rival a quality 35mm SLR.  Coupled with a powerful editing tool (like Adobe Photoshop), and great color printer (like my Epson Photo), and you can work like a pro and print only what you like.  This camera will end up saving you thousands of $$$ in processing alone!  It even has a flash sinc for use with off camera flash (must use Nikon 3pin PC cord though).

Picture files can be small ~200k (JPG basic), ~1meg (JPG normal) or giant ~16 megs (TIFF) and quality follows, but oh, the choices and control you have; including choices like aperture priority and variable shutter speeds to 1/1000 of a second. This camera can become a powerful tool for the professional.  I am throwing away my Polaroid back for my Mamiya RB67.  If you are an experienced photographer and are looking for quality computer interface photos, this camera is cleverly designed and clearly has the clout to make your photographs speak volumes!

One last thing about batteries.  I have purchased the nickel metal hydride batteries to stave off the mega cost of keeping my camera going and going.  The initial costs are high, but the savings will pay for itself in a few short weeks.  Purchase excellent quality batteries with good output and you will be happy with only two or three sets.  

Another wonderful feature I use is the off camera sinc for flash.  The on camera flash can produce red eye unless you use the red eye setting. This remedies the flat light from the on board flash.  You must purchase the Nikon flash sinc cable and turn the ext. flash on in the settings.<br><br>
