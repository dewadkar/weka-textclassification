            I have seen many people listing the Tacoma as the best truck ever.  I will not dispute that it is a good little truck, but there a few things I would like to change about mine.

1. The transfer case shifter is in the way of the driver's right knee when you are using cruise control and trying to rest your leg.  It is very difficult to find a position that doesn't put your knee up against the lever.

2.  The windsheild wipers are not the greatest and they wear out fast.

3.  The absence of true drink holders are greatly missed.  They center console has a depression that can be used, but it doesn't hold two drinks well.  The drink holder behind the passenger seat is virtually useless and might be better of eliminated.

4.  The bucket seats are comfortable on short trips, but they tend to lack support in proper places over the long haul.  

Overall, I wouldn't sway many people from buying this truck, but it would be nice if these things were fixed.  Toyota engineers have been designing great trucks for years, it seems these things would not have slipped by them.<br><br>
