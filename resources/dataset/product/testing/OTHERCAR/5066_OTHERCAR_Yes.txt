            INRODUCTION
The Sony Mavica MVC-FD75 digital camera is the second digital camera I&#146ve had. I bought it to replace the HP 215 that I also reviewed &#150 and rightfully ripped to shreds. With an optical zoom and simple features, the Mavica has filled the digital void left by the HP 215 and filled it well.

Without any further delay, let&#146s jump into my review.

PROS
The first good thing to say about the Mavica is that there are no memory cards &#150 sort of! All images are stored onto a floppy disc, which can hold anywhere from 36 to 25 images depending on the Image Quality setting: Fine, Standard, Low. And since floppies cost considerably less than any type of Smart Media or Compact Flash, it&#146s pretty economical. This camera also features a nifty Email setting in which it takes both full-size and thumbnail image, perfect for emailing. Having the images stored on a floppy also means not having to buy a card reader for transferring the images.

Speaking of image size, the Mavica takes them at 640 x 480 .JPG images &#150 much smaller than a one megapixel camera. This makes this camera the ideal camera for uploading or emailing pictures and just okay for printing. More on that later.

The controls are all on the rear of the camera. A thumb-wheel button acts as the main controlling device, allowing you to easily navigate through the options menu. Options include Flash Level (Low, Standard, High), Image Quality, Bitmap, and Disc options. The Mavica also has some Special Features: Sepia, Black and White, Solarize and Reversal. All of these features allow you to express your creative side but remember that they are irreversible. If you take one in b/w but want one in color, you are out of luck. While useful, they are practically unnecessary with today&#146s digital imaging software that can allow you to do the same thing, and preserve the original color version.

Also on the back is the Flash button. This allows you to turn the flash off and on without having to navigate through a menu screen.

What about battery life? Nothing less than outstanding in my book. On a trip to Las Vegas, a single charge lasted over 2 hours. There was still juice when I returned to the hotel. During the entire trip, which included side trips to Hoover Dam and Red Rock Canyon, I never had to worry about the battery dying on me. Buying a backup battery for any camera is always a good idea but with this camera I never had to.

The 10x optical zoom is controlled by a thumb switch at the top right of the rear of the camera. This zoom really zooms, too! If you are less concerned with great image quality and more with capturing the moment, you will love this zoom.

The Mavica features a hefty LCD screen as well. When compared to most other digital cameras, this screen is massive. This means less squinting when looking at images.

The lens on this camera allows for close-up shots &#150 and I mean close-up! I&#146ve taken pictures of centipedes crawling on the ground at a very close range and they are pretty sharp. The closest I&#146ve taken a picture was less than 1&#148. Depending on your subject matter, that might even be TOO close!

In the box: imaging software, battery, charger, strap, instructions and lens cap.

CONS
Time for a reality check! While this camera has been great in every way, I can&#146t say all positive things about it.

First of all, the floppies. While they can hold a decent amount of pictures you are stuck with carrying a box of floppies with you. A little inconvenient. A camera with a large capacity storage media will be able to hold many more images and eliminate the need to carry extra bulky items.

The camera is a bit large but remember that it does have a floppy drive in it. If size is a concern then you might want to reconsider this camera &#150 not recommended for sneaking into concerts, if you know what I mean.

Finally, print quality. This camera is best suited for emailing and uploading images. The images are 640 x 480 @ 72 dpi which means that print quality will be a little less than amazing. Don&#146t get me wrong, I have gotten decent quality 4x6 prints but if you are looking for anything larger than that, this Mavica simply isn&#146t going to deliver. If you are looking for clear prints from either your inkjet printer or through a photo lab, then go at least 3 megapixels.

THE VERDICT
The Mavica has served me well. I paid $349 for it about a year ago and if you can still find one, you can get it for about $199 or less. That&#146s a small price to pay for a fun camera that is packed with lots of spiffy features and is easy to use. While I&#146ve moved on and have a Canon S20, I still use my Mavica for certain applications that require a quick, low-res imaging solution.
