            We bought our 1996 Acura Integra Special Edition Coupe (aka LSS) off the dealer lot in late December 1996. It was one of the few remaining '96 models, so we were able to get a really good deal. The SE is basically a GSR without the VTEC. It came standard with leather, special edition wheels, badging and a rear spoiler. 

We've owned the car for 4 years and have had no mechanical problems at all. The 1.8 liter 4 cylinder engine puts out 112 horsepower and although I wouldn't call the torque thrust even &quot;peppy&quot;, I would say its adequate under most circumstances.

When we bought the car, it was 2 years into its design cycle. A 2001 Integra basically looks like a 1994 Integra. A new model is set to come out for the 2002 model year, but its expected not to carry the Integra name. Overall, the exterior styling has held up well, our car still attracts gawks from the teenage crowd. You have to wash an Integra to truly appreciate its exterior design. There are all kinds of subtle creases, that you don't notice when you just look @ the car. If you take the time to touch and feel the car, you will notice all kinds of handsome characteristics to the design.

We are one of the crazy families that actually enjoy shifting gears, so we opted for the 5 speed transmission (It can be burdensome in urban areas with traffic problems). We get somewhere in the ball park of 25 miles per gallon in mostly city driving. The car has go-cart like handling, meaning its fun to drive.

The go-cart description is how to describe the ride too. Its rather harsh on any surface other than a smooth one. There is extremely loud road noise that creeps into the cabin, to the point that you have to turn up or turn down the stereo based on your speed and road surface.

Speaking of stereo's, the AM/FM cassette player has poor sound. The 1997 model came standard with a CD player and 2 extra speakers. I can only assume they sound better than ours.

I am not a big guy, yet I feel cramped in the Integra. The leather bound front seats are firm. Driving position is low slung, but comfortable. The back seats although cramped are okay for short trips. Headroom is next to nil in the back.  We enjoy the versatility of the hatchback and the split fold down rear seats, which provide ample cargo room. The Integra is our &quot;pick-up&quot;.

The dashboard is Honda simple, with all the information you need right before you. Interior plastics are low budget, if you consider the fact this is supposed to be a &quot;high-end&quot; little car.

Build quality has been good, with a few complaints:

We had to have both interior door panels replaced (on warranty) as the plastic began to &quot;crinkle&quot; within the first year of ownership. The back hatch and plastic roof liner rattle more than we think they should.    
 
Our Integra has been a great little car.  We think its holding up well and intend on keeping it for a few more years. When we do trade it in, we expect to get top dollar @ trade in time...you really can't go wrong with any Acura/Honda product....but the Integra is strictly a car for singles or teens. 2001 there is no 4 door available.<br><br>
