            Bought S430 AMG with most S500 options/gadgets on 3/31/00. 

3 years feel like I own&drive brand new vehicle, nothing matching it. No such thing as over-engineering. 

Only klutzy thing  is user interface on integrated COMAND system, but, I'm Mac-user. Would've liked wood-trim steering, gear knob. Loved included Motorola StarTac. New models have newer phones. 

6-CD changer decent. Got extra magazines. (Same in BMW,  convenient to switch cars, carry music).  Would love Apple iPod connector. 

Seats' adjustable lumbar support, heat, are great. Gas mileage pleasant surprise.  Luxury, even with thin AMG sport tyres great. 

LOVE aircushioned feel. Most noticed crossing intersecting roads different heights, most cars would give lift-off crash-down feeling, won't notice went over a dip-rise-dip at 80 any more than 40. Amazing.
