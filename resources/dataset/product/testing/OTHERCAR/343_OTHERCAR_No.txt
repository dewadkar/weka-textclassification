            I bought the thing because I liked the way it looked, plain and simple.  I have had MANY vehicles in my 44 years, many cars, several trucks, an Eddie Bauer Aerostar, a couple SUVs... and I bought this thing because it looked great, and fit OK into my lifestyle.

I've had the thing since November.  Here are my observations:

The engine compartment is a chamber of horrors - when I opened the hood at the dealer, it nearly broke the deal right there.  But &quot;fogettabout it&quot; ... that will be Nissan's problem, not mine.  The vehicle has a 36,000 mile warranty, and I'll be the former owner before that number shows up on the odometer.  But if you want to see how NOT to fit an engine into an engine compartment, take a look at the XTerra (and make a special note of the ancient-technology prop-stick which holds the hood up).  Cheap, cheap, cheap.

Speaking of the engine, it gets lousy mileage (15MPH), and is somewhat underpowered, although it's good enough for what I use it for.  I live in San Francisco, and the engine handles the hills well enough.

Handling is fine, although crossing the Bay Bridge with high winds is a white-knuckler.  The aerodynamics of the high-profile vehicle demand both hands on the steering wheel during windy conditions.  I've only had it in the snow once; found shifting into 4WD kind of confusing - and the manual was VERY vague on how it was done.  Once in 4WD, I was still slipping and sliding on packed snow - which I found very surprising, and unexpected.

Heating/AC/Ventilation is great.  Best heater I've ever had on a vehicle.

The famous bump on the rear tailgate - the bump that holds the medicine bag:  the same trip to the snow found me with a screaming headache, and I was glad I had the medicine kit - except I guess Nissan Engineers don't get headaches - no aspirin.  Mondo stupid, IMHO.  

The stereo is in a major need for a poweramp.  Very anemic sound, and the radio isn't half as sensitive as the one in my Maxima.  Very disappointed with this feature.  The hutch, in which to place your CD's is adequately sized.  I find it curious that there are 12V cigarette lighter outlets all over the vehicle, and an ashtray, but none of the outlets actually have a cigarette lighter, just a cap.  Odd. 

NO LIGHT IN THE GLOVEBOX???? WHAT????

Speaking of no lights in the glovebox, the console lights are so bright as to be REALLY hazardous to use at night, even for the passenger, when driving.  Maybe they thought this overly-bright light would make up for the missing light in the glovebox?

Yes they give you ten tie-down places ... but they give you NO PLACES to stow your bungy cords.  Lunacy.

Having to remove the seat cushions in order to lower the rear seat backs, and giving us no place to stow said seat cushions - clearly, somebody on the design team had a drug problem.  My rear seat cushions reside comfortably in my living room closet, effectively making my Xterra a 2 seater.

The carpet in the rear cargo area is clipped down with the cheapest plastic clips money can buy.  I have an 80 lb dog, and these clips aren't going to last, even though she doesn't chew on them...merely steps on them.  The &quot;fabric&quot;...some non-woven conglomeration of synthetic fibers, is the excuse for a carpet.  It's somewhat pathetic.

But damn, the vehicle looks good, especially in Black.  It DOES get rubbernecked alot.  Just what this mid-life crisis needed.<br><br>
