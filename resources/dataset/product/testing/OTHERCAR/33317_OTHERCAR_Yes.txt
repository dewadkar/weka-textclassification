            I bought my 1998 Subaru Forester after researching the CR-V and the Forester side-by-side.  The safety features sold the car to me.  I love the space, the height, and the comfort the Forester has to offer.  I can carry my art supplies and my big dog in comfort and style.  
   Driving the Forester is a pleasure.  The huge windshield and rear window allow the driver to see everything, without a blocked view.  The ride is comfortable, and the car chassis and all-wheel-drive make me feel very safe.  
   I recommend the Forester to anyone looking for a small SUV. It would be a wonderful family car or a superb first car for a teenager.  <br><br>
