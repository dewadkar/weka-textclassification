            The Fuji 2400 is dead easy to handle. If you don't want to fool around with menus and settings you won't have to, and it will still take nice pictures. The 3x zoom lens seems to be very sharp for this price-range camera, and it takes pictures with good contrast and colors. If you are interested in settings and features you can reach them on the rear LCD panel. Some of them are a bit tricky to get to and don't expect any pro-level customization... :-) Battery life could be better - buy yourself some NIMH rechargeable batteries (at least 8 of them) and you will see that you get more pictures out of one set than alkalines. Also get either an AC adapter or a USB card reader so you won't have to use up camera battery life while transfering pictures to your PC/Mac. You should also invest in some more Smartmedia memory cards, since you will only fit 10 pictures of highest resolution and quality on the 8Mb card that comes with the camera. Get as much memory as you can afford!
The 2400 is an excellent choice if you want to take family and travel snapshots and post them on the web or print up to 8x10. It is certainly not pro-level, but it will be more than adequate for most people. It is an easy camera to use and its automatic exposure etc will take perfect pictures in most any situation. The lens is sharp, and the camera is surprisingly small, and sits nicely in your hand. 
Some other things I would recommend you to get for your 2400 is a good camera bag. There are camera bags made especially for digital cameras, but they seem to cost more than regulars, and I don't think they are necessary. Also get a good neck strap for your 2400 so you can hang it around your neck. It comes with a flimsy wrist strap which is all but unusable. There are special neck straps for point-and-shoot cameras that will help you look after your camera.
