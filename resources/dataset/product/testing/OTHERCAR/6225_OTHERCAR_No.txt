            When I was growing up there were quite a few constants in my life...one of them being that my parents always owned a truck and a car.  The car was usually a Honda and the truck for the most part was a Ford.  In the early 80's my dad bought a 4X4 Nissan King Cab Truck.  It was black...it was big and I thought it was cool.  We drove around Canada in that truck and I sat out back and read books during the drive.  One day my father broke the news that he'd be getting a new truck...one that wasn't as much of a gas hog.  He came home that day with a shining new blue Nissan truck.  It was very little comparatively to the other truck and I was greatly disappointed.  How was I to know that that truck would be the best little truck I've ever seen.

As I grew up...I finally had the chance to drive that truck.  It was a standard with no power steering and I soon learned to master it.  When I was in high school..it was my one form of transportation and I lovingly called it &quot;Betsy.&quot;  That truck drove around like no other...it hit a few mailboxes and a few snow banks...but it got pretty good gas mileage and lasted for over 170,000 miles. The power in this truck was very impressive....it didn't lose any power going up the hill and it continued to run well, never having to go into the mechanic money pit once.  I can't say enough good things about this truck....my truck.

My dad decided to trade in the truck for a Mazda B series truck in 1996.  I have to say that even though the new truck was a pretty truck....that shined and smelled new, it didn't have the power, the gas mileage, or the reliability of my Nissan truck.  <br><br>
