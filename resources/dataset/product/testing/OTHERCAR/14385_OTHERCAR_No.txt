            Has the public really wanted to remove all the chrome from cars, or is it simply the work of the car designers?  The new 2000 Deville is ugly!  I thought we were doing away with boxes!  It would look so much better with chrome
molding strips on the sides, and some chrome on the bumpers, a la the current Lincoln Continental, which I own (it's a '98 which hasn't changed).

Cars have gotten so plain, that you can't tell a Caddy from a Chevy.  In fact, Chevys have more style and some chrome, so they look more stylish than this box.

The inside is nice, but if you want a digital dash (not in the DTS or DHS models), you can't get the Navigator screen.  If you want the nice hood ornament (also not in those models), you also can't get the Navigator screen which shows a map of your position.  WHO MAKES UP THESE RIDICULOUS RULES???

The bulky door handles are plain ugly.  Although I prefer chrome handles like the Lincolns and the Infinitis, I can put up with others if they are attractive.  These are just ugly, contributing to the ugliness of this car.  The Seville, which was an attractive car with chrome accents, also has gotten bare in '00, and has become much uglier.

Bring back a model which resembles the beautiful '59 with its pointed lights and fins.  We need a drastic change back to beautiful and unique styling.  Who looks at cars any more and ahhhhs and oooohs over the looks?<br><br>
