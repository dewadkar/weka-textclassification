            I've had my Canon S300 since March of 2002, and I'm very happy with this great little digital camera.

Performance: 
This little camera has an excellent lens for its size that does a great job taking crisp and rich color pictures.  I've had success printing pics in the standard 4x6 size and the larger 5x7 size with no problems at my local camera shop (I have not tried printing them on a home printer).  The pics look great.  I'm reluctant to print an 8x10 since its only a 2 mega pixel camera.  I've also taken and printed nice looking black and white pictures as well.

Night shooting is OK (I took some nice light shots in Vegas last year), but it's obviously limited when compared to manual SLR cameras.  I've had pretty good success using a monopod and switching it to night shooting mode. But again, don't expect to get great night time pics you can blow up.

Portability:
Its small size was a big reason I purchased this product. It is very portable. My wife can slip it into her purse without adding much bulk and I purchased a tiny camera bag that has a loop for my belt to slide through.  I thus wear the camera around my waist (via the belt bag) when traveling.  People don't know its a camera (its pretty small) and so I don't feel and look like a toursit target for theft. 

Looks:
The brushed stainless steel case and small size make this one of the most attractive digital cameras on the market...it has a high cool factor.

Issues:
I haven't figured out how to use the stitch feature which allows for panoramic pictures.  I'll have to thumb through the user manual again...this feature isn't very intuitive.  If you want to print 8x10 + size pictures, I recommend spending a few more dollars and buying the 3 or 4 mega pixel versions.

Tips:  
I recommend getting an extra battery and at least a 120MB memory card.  This will give you plenty of battery time and good memory card storage (I get approx 200 pics on the 120MB card using "fine" resolution).
