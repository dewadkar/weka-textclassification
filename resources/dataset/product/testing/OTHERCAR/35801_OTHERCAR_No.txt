            I own a Saturn SL1, 1995 model, that currently has 197,000 miles on the odometer. Most of those miles are from state to state commutes, interstate driving. I guess you could say I both like and hate my Saturn. I originally purchased my Saturn because of its reputation for reliability, and over the long haul, I guess you could say it has been reliable. But my car has had so many hateful little and not so little things go wrong with it that I both like it for its reliability and hate it for its propensity to have things wrong with it.

Both front doors leak, for starters. They have for three years! Not it heavy rains, mind you, but in light to moderate rain. I can't count the times I've gone to work with the seat of my pants soaked. When someone asks, I just say &quot;I drive Saturn&quot;. I've had a lifter that has clattered off and on since 20,000 miles. At the time, I was driving 1200 miles a week and passed the 36,000 mile warranty before I could have it looked at. It was 500 miles out of warranty and it had been doing this &quot;clattering&quot; for 16,000 miles (12 weeks) and they wanted $350 to fix it. That's another gripe I have: I've had my car to the Saturn dealership at least 2 dozen times and it's NEVER been washed. Okay, that's something little. But save the 197,000 miles, my Saturn experience has not been good.

Within 3 months of buying it, I began to have trouble with the engine losing power and missing. It would just come and go. On the sixth trip to the Saturn dealership the faulty EGR valve that was causing this problem was finally fixed. It was correctly diagnosed and replaced on the fifth trip, but the new replacement valve was also faulty. Between the third and fourth trip to the dealer, I was taking my wife to the hospital at 5am with her contractions 5 minutes apart and....you guessed it! Here we are 8 miles short of the hospital puttering down the emergency lane at 35 mph!

The seat back on the drivers seat would ratchet back with the slightest pressure. It was recalled and fixed......however I complained to Saturn corporate 2 years before it was recalled and fixed. I told my wife if I was ever in a wreck that that deathtrap of a seat could very well have been the cause. When you're flat on your back at 60 mph.....that's not a good feeling.

That's why I like/hate my Saturn.<br><br>
