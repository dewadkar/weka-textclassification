            The X5 proves that BMW does know how to build a highly desirable SUV. Its decision to build such a vehicle was initially ridiculed by some quarters who claimed it was made due to the success of the Mercedes Benz M-Class. 

Now, as everyone can see, the X5 is all wholly by BMW. The all-important platform is based on the 5-series. And, where Land Rover and most other serious 4x4 makers use a strong ladder frame chassis, BMW did it the passenger car way--with a monocoque body. 

Four-wheel drive technology is via what BMW knows best--using its latest traction control for all four wheels, Automatic Stability Control (ASC-X) and Dynamic Stability Control (DSC). Both are computer-controlled electronic aids that automatically correct a slide or give back stability should the vehicle yaw from side to side. 

Both conditions occur regularly, especially when road conditions are wet and slippery, or when the driver goes over the threshold of his or her driving limits and loses stability especially in a tight or sweeping corner. 

The suspension is a combination of MacPherson struts for the front and a multi-link with semi-trailing arms for the rear. It shows that BMW is taking the safe way by following the usual 4x4 practice--using the proven MacPherson struts for the front but in the rear adopting a retuned 7-series rear multi-link setup. 

The added feature is the self-levelling function which is useful should the X5 tow another vehicle or carry heavy loads. 

For those who want to drive more exuberantly, or regularly want to push the vehicle that much harder, a sports suspension package is available. 

Even though it uses a 5-series platform, the X5 is a large vehicle by any standard; and thus larger 332mm ventilated discs are fitted in the front while the rear has 324mm discs. The latest four-channel ABS along with CBC (Cornering Brake Control) and DBC (Dynamic Brake Control) are to be found, showing that BMW is serious about safer braking under all conditions. 

The heart of the X5 is the powerpacked 4.4-litre V8 32-valve 286bhp quad-cam Double Vanos. It can embarrass any high-powered sports car that's not in the same league as a Porsche or a Lotus Elise. 

This is because the X5 is extremely quick, taking only 7.5 seconds to accelerate from a standing start to 100kph. Top speed is computer-controlled to 210kph. 

Like the other BMW models, the X5 has a five-speed automatic/manual/Steptronic transmission that makes driving more enjoyable. With three different modes, a driver can choose one to suit his or her driving style. 

The luxurious interior is all BMW, from the leather seats to the dashboard design and the instrumentation. BMW owners will feel perfectly at home in the X5, with the added advantage of sitting higher up and enjoying the improved all-round visibility. 

The bottom line is that BMW has built one of the most desirable and sought after luxurious upmarket SUVs. The only hiccup is that with its big 4.4 litre V8 engine, fuel consumption is on the heavy side; but if you can afford it, fuel consumption should not be a problem. 

There has been such a high demand for the X5 since its launch that, even though BMW has upped production, buyers in certain countries still have at least a year's waiting list. 

At the same time, accolades are pouring in for the US-built X5. It is being produced in the same Spartanburg facility in North Carolina that also makes the Z3 sportscar. 

In the first year of production, readers of Automobile Magazine in the US awarded the X5 4.4i a Readers' Choice All-Star for "Best Small/Mid-Size SUV.'' The magazine also lauded the X5 for "setting new on-road standards for vehicles that can also venture off the pavement.'' 

Last November, the Washington-based Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) described the X5 as the best vehicle yet tested in its 64kph (80mph) offset crash test. IIHS noted that "the occupant compartment sustained very little damage and measured intrusion into the compartment was less than in any other vehicle the Institute has tested... BMW has set the standard for all other manufacturers to aspire to.'' 

This February, the X5 was named winner in the off-road category in the "Best Cars of the World 2001'' readers poll conducted by the leading German car magazine auto Motor Und Sport. 

What Car?, the highly respected British auto magazine, in its March issue awarded the X5 "Winner of the 4X4 category'' in the "Car of the Year 2001'' Awards. 

All this augurs well for the X5. BMW has proven that even without 4x4 experience, once it gets down to it, it can meet the challenge.
