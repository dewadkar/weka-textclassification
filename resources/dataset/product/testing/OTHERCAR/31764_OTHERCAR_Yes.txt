            &amp;#65279;If you like the finer things than you will like this.  BMW has paid close attention to detail in the323ic.  Little things like the windows automatically open and close with just one touch.  The radio offers 12 stations and if you chose the call letters will appear instead of the numbers.  The seat adjusts in six different positions, great for those of us that are vertically challenged.  It is the only convertible in which I could comfortably sit and see (I'm only 5').  The 323ic is an incredible drive, especially for the price!  It drives like a dream and handles like a charm.  If you enjoy driving you will enjoy this car.

BMW still has room for improvement.  The cup holder is under the armrest making it quite inconvenient.  Also, after a year you begin to notice a rattle hear and there.  Nothing major just annoying.  Finally, my last complaint, the top sometimes sticks when you put it down.  It is easy to fix but once again very annoying.
