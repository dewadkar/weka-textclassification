            I had this truck for a year now. Based on Toyota's reputation for being reliable and performance, and after the test drive, this truck was the Toy for me.  The V6 model comes with a standard V6 190 Horsepower, that is more horse power than a lot of the other trucks in the same class.  I'm impress with gas mileage for V6. You can feel the acceleration on this truck.  The dash is pleasant to the eyes.  The truck design itself is eyecandy. Also Toyota trucks have great resale value, don't forget that.  The drawbacks on this truck is the extracab, its really small compared to domestic trucks.  It has mini seat in the back, but even Alley Mcbeal would be uncomfortable sitting back there.  If your use to Ford or Chevy feel, its going be different world for you.  Its a little rougher, but thats why you get a truck in the first place.  Unless your get the TRD version, you need to get a bedliner.  Only TRD version comes with ABS, so if you have deep pockets, you should opt for the TRD version.  The Toyota Prerunner is more geared towards the Gen Xers, not your family truck.  So if you're looking for fun truck to drive with a lot of horse power, then selecting the Tacoma Prerunner V6 is for you.  <br><br>
