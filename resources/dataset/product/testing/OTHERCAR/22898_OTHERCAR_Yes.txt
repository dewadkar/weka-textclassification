            The body of the car is sleek and very sporty. My car is not the usual hatch back style. It has a longer back, which I like the shape of it as compared to the other. Because of this body style it is a unique looking car, not like every other foriegn car out there. I have had a few problems with the car, I had to have the transmission rebuilt, this was quite expensive with the overdrive option. Also the gas gadge is broken and the trunk will not open at all, with key or latch. This car only had 52,000 miles  a 1 1/2 years ago when I bought it, which was a plus and it still only has 73,000 miles, not bad for a 12 year old vehicle. I love the alarm feature and the manual disabling feature, it really helps a lot.
The body style,I have to admit, is what first caught my eye. Again, I am an avid 300zx fan and have had three of them in the past. But for the money, the 240sx was comparable looks wise and a lot more reliable/sensible. Even though the "Z" is still my favorite car in the world.
