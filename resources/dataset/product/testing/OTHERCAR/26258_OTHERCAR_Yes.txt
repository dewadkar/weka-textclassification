            I just leased a Civic Si and it looks sooo cool.  I stickered it up nice and good so that all the girls will think it is fast.  I put eibach springs,  Momo tires and a Jackson racing exhaust system on there with a 5 inch exhaust tip!  It sounds really loud when it gets high in RPMs, and I figure the louder the car the faster, right?  I don't know how much I spent on stickers, but they were worth it.  You can almost not see the original color under them, it was red by the way.

I know you aren't supposed to mess with lease cars, but I figure when I'm done with the Civic they will be glad to have it.  It'll look soooo cool that anyone would buy it in a second.  Unfortunately I won't be able to because I spent so much on the exhaust and stickers.  I basically doubled the price of the car.  But I don't mind.

Man is this car fast!  It has the VTEC engine which means it goes really fast.  I don't really know why, but that's what the people who write the articles for sports compact car and turbo say, so it has to be right, right?  Unfortunately there are other fast cars out there too.  I never realized that there are cars out there that are fast, but don't look it.  There are all of these ugly German cars that beat me in races.  They must have nitros or something because there is no way a car can look slow, but be fast.  It just doesn't make sense, I mean come on.  I also noticed that my car really isn't as fast as I thought it would be.  I basically have to put it into the redline before it gets really fast, and it got worse after I put in the new exhaust.  But it was worth t cause the girls think it looks fast.

One bad thing about having a car that looks really fast, but isn't as fast as you thought it would be, is that cops pull you over.  I tried to run from one once, but it didn't work out as good as I thought it would.  Those American cars can go fast in a straight line!  If I could have practiced the turns a little I might have done better, but they caught me.  Maybe I need a new cam shaft or something.  My parents bailed me out, man were they mad!

The interior is really kind of cramped.  The back seat isn't really good for anything, but putting stuff on.  And my trunk is filled with my stereo equipment.  But there wasn't that much room there before, anyway.  I found I look really cool in my fast looking car if I recline the seat all the way down.  That way people can only see my head, and not see my scranny little body.  But when they see my head with the hat turned backwards in this fast looking car they think I'm  a player or something.

Well I hope I was helpful to you.  This is a great chick magnate car!  It attracts so many that most civics I see are driven by them!  It's like taking a poetry class you are surrounded by chicks, so you are bound to get one, right?  Actually this car hasn't helped me get any girls yet, but I'm sure it will!  Go and lease a Civic Si and make it look fast!  It is awesome, and there are so many Civics riced out that you won't be alone.  Strength in numbers!  Peace out all!
