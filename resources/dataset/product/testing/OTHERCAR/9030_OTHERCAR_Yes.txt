                I purchased a 2000 Kia Sportage in September of last year. I had up until that point been driving a 1996 GMC Suburban, and test drove the Kia on a whim because I thought it looked cute. I was very sure that it would be a gutless, cheap, toy SUV. Boy, was I wrong. First, I was completely amazed by the leg room in the drivers seat, it is very spacious, as much or more as the Suburban. 
    I asked my Kia dealer if I would be allowed to drive it to the top of a 6800' mountain located near our city for a test drive, and was quite pleasantly surprised when they agreed to allow me to do so. I was astounded by the Kia's performance. I did have to use low in a lot of places where my Suburban didn't notice the incline, but then again my Suburban had vastly more power. The Kia is adequately powered for the use that I put it to, and is surprising on snow and ice on paved roads and in the mountains too. By the time I got back from my test drive I was sold on it, because it will do the job I need it for, which is to get me to the tops of mountains.
    It is not as robust as the Suburban by any means, but for half the price, I am impressed. There is one really annoying bug that I have noticed. When I drive over 55 MPH the right passenger window will not roll up all the way until I slow down. Other than that I love it so far.<br><br>
