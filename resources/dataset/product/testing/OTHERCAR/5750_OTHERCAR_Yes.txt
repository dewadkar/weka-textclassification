            I have to admit that after not one but two test drives I am confused about this car.  Everything I read applauds the new V6 200 hp engine, and both test drives I took demonstrated to me the car is quick to move from a complete stop.  However, and this is the confusing part, both LXi's I took for test drives had trouble going up the smallest hills.  I'm not sure why on level roads the car seems powerful, but on hills it seems to struggle.  Maybe it has to do with the design of the transmission.  Either way, it is definitely underpowered going up hills.

Nevertheless, the interior is very comfortable, with enough headroom and legroom for tall people, and frankly, enough "other room" for those of us who need room in other directions...

All controls are easily accessible except perhaps the optional CD changer, which is mounted rather low and may conflict with whatever cups that are in the cupholders.

Styling I understand is very subjective.  But I think we can form a consensus on the fact that the Sebring convertible is designed to have a "never-go-out-of-style-conservative-look".  If you like chrome, there's a little bit of it.  If you like a "serious" looking car rather than a "whimsical" or "in-your-face" look, this car will please you.  

Another plus is its front-wheel drive, which is important to provide the flexibility of using it as a year-round driver where I live.

An added bonus this car provides is a large back seat, which is rare in the more sporty convertibles such as the Mustang, Eclipse, Firebird, and Camaro.  

The only real competition to this car is the Toyota Solara convertible, which is more expensive, but similarly styled.

Overall I am still considering purchasing this vehicle because in my opinion the conservative styling and sluggishness on hills does not outweigh the comfort and convenience provided.
