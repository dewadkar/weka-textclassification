            We began looking for a new car shortly after our son was born and realized a 2-door sports coupe was not the ideal family car.  We had seen the Malibu commercials on T.V. and decided to take one for a test drive.  

The Malibu had all the features we were looking for:  4-door mid-size vehicle with good safety features, reasonable price tag even with full options, and good gas mileage.

After owning the Malibu for two years we are still very satisfied customers.  The only feature that we are disappointed in is the stereo.  It Has no power at all.  Shortly after purchasing the car, Chevrolet called and surveyed us.  We told them about the sound system and how it should be more powerful and were informed that there were several similar complaints and that the system would more than likely be improved.

I would recommend the Malibu for everyone, especially for families.  There is plenty of room in the back for two adults and a car seat, and a nice roomy trunk for strollers, toys and food.
