            After 9 years we were about to have a new baby in the house.  My husband felt that my Monte Carlo was just not going to be convenient any more.  But I loved my Monte Carlo, the power the looks and everything but it was a two door.

We bought a Plymouth Voyager.  I love it.  Its a four door.  The first night we had it we took 4 eight year olds out to dinner.  Now this van must also make you brave. lol

It has been so convenient for getting car seats in and out as well as other children.  Sometimes I take 4 kids to school in the morning.  They do not have to crawl over each other like they had to in the car.

Theres lots of room in the rear for groceries and other stuff.

We did get the short wheel base and I do wish we had gotten the long wheel base you can always use more room.
