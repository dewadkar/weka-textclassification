            I started college in the fall of 1996, and the Mercury Sable was the car my dad chose to give me.  He said that it was better than the old pick-up I was driving because it had driver and passenger side air bags and would get better gas mileage.  These two things proved to be the only good things about the car.  After putting 40,000 miles on this vehicle I have gotten to know it very well.  The transmission and A/C had to be worked on and once it was "fixed", the A/C went out AGAIN on the 3.5 hour drive back to college!  I went the whole summer without A/C, and if I had to choose any option over another, it would be a great air conditioner!!  I have also had many problems with keeping tires on this car.  I have had 2 blow-outs and 3 flats!   I purchased name-brand tires, and still something is wearing them down because they just don't seem to last.

The cruise control only works when it wants to.  I have also had this worked on, TWICE!  Wiring defect.  I cannot unlock the passenger-side door from the outside.

All-in-all, this vehicle isn't very dependable, and I would NEVER recommend it to a friend.
