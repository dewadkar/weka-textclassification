            This is a slick little camera that is very user friendly.  There are only a few buttons so it doesn't get too complicated.  It comes with everything you need to take great pictures and get them on your computer so you can print, e-mail them to friends/family or put them on the web. Shop around, I found mine for $259.00 and that's with the accessories and software you need. Adobe Photoshop and Pagemill come with it.  Photoshop is a great program but will take some time to master. Pagemill is for the more experienced person that wants to create webpages.  Don't let that scare you, the camera gets the job done.  You will use and enjoy this fun little camera.  For the price you can't beat this camera.<br><br>
