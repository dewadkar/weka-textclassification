            Why this vehicle? 
- It's cheap for it's size and compared to it's competition. The Xterra is designed to complete against mini-SUVs like the CRV or RAV4, or cheaper mid-sized SUVS like the Isuzu Rodeo or Jeep Cherokee. The Xterra offers true 4x4 functionality that the mini-SUVs lack, while undercutting the prices of the Rodeo.

What's to love about it?
- Besides the cheap price, the overall style of the Xterra's body is sure to turn heads since it's relatively rare and unique. It handles relatively well for a truck, with the tightest turning radius of all the mid-size SUVs I've test driven. Lots of cargo room, well designed, functional controls, and a functional rack that's not just for show.

What's to hate about it?
- Gas mileage, which is expected for an SUV. 
- Power... the Xterra seriously lacks power for freeway driving, especially up steep hills. However, it's V6 engine is more then adequate for keeping up with traffic. This truck is not meant for people who want to drive it like a sports coupe. 

What's it like to drive?
- Nothing like a car. This is not a SUV that is based on a car's frame like the CRV or RAV4. It handles like a truck, and even has a truck's handbrake (taken straight from the Nissan Frontier). If you are looking for an SUV that drives like a car, try the CRV, RAV4, Lexus 300 or BMW X5.

Who should buy this vehicle?
- Anyone who is interested in a down-to-earth, no frills SUV. Great for taking up into the snow. Plus, there's a great online community of Xterra owners who help each other out

Who shouldn't?
- Anyone looking for a luxury SUV, or something that rides/handles like a car


Good SUVs to compare against:
Isuzu Rodeo... ~$28,000
- The Rodeo has more horsepower and more convenient folding seats compared to the Xterra. However, they have a known history of mechanical failures which have owners taking their Rodeos back to the shop very often. While the Xterra is a new design for 2000, so far, I have not heard of anyone encountering serious problems, or any recalls. 
- You might be able to obtain a Rodeo at a bargain as Isuzu dealers seem desperate to unload it. A Isuzu dealer I was talking to was offering to beat any price on the Xterra for an Isuzu Rodeo with similar equipment

Honda CRV... ~$19,000
- Cheaper then the Xterra with slightly more passenger space. It also comes with a picnic table! This SUV handles very much like the Civic that it is based on, good acceleration, very little rolling. However, it's All-Wheel drive system is not a true 4x4 system like the Xterra's is. This car will get you through most chain control, but not for serious off-roading

Toyota RAV4... ~$?
- Waaaaay too small. It may seem to be the same size as the CRV, but it cannot hold 5 people comfortably

Toyota 4Runner... ~$29,000
- Great truck, proven design, nice big truck. This truck is slightly more bumpy then the Xterra, but it's price tag pushes it out of my range

Nissan Pathfinder... ~$28,000
- The Xterra's &quot;Big Brother&quot;. Sales of the Pathfinder have probably been driven down due to the Xterra's cheaper price, and the Infinity QX4's almost comparable price. However, I have seen Ads that are offering discounts on the Pathfinder to drive it low enough to compete with the Xterra


Misc hints on buying the Xterra:
Due to it's popularity, most dealers have ridiculous mark-ups (~$3000) on all 2000 Xterra's. However, I have heard stories of the dealer who runs http://www.xterrastore.com offering reasonable prices, plus offering to fly you out to pick up your own Xterra. I did not do this myself, but it might be something to look into. A good price to get the Xterra would be about $500 under MSRP at this time.


Update (5/15/00)
- I took my Xterra off-roading about a week ago, and found it to be very capable of handling the dirt roads, and obstacles. The 4-Lo setting proved itself very capable as the Xterra kept up with Jeeps and other vehicles. One thing to note about the Xterra is that I recommend that you remove the step rails before attempting anything difficult. The step rails are not too sturdy, and will bend easily if it comes into contact with any rocks<br><br>
