            The Mitsubishi Galant is a very nice car to look at, but unfortunately that's all we found it to be.  We purchased our Galant back in 1996.  Galant's have been spoken of favorably in the past, so we had little apprehension about getting one.  The car is priced very reasonably for the extras that we got, which included a sun roof and a CD player.  At first, we were very happy with our car, and wouldn't have hesitated in referring it to a friend.  

Well about one year into our Mitsubishi ownership, we started hearing all kinds of noises and rattling coming from the hood.  We immediately took it in, only to get no explanation from the dealer.  Please keep in mind that we've only had this car for about a year.  The general driving of the car was O.K.  The only downfall was that it was  4 cylinder and the pickup was really slow.....really really slow.  Then to top things off, about 6 months later the timing belt broke.  I was enraged, even though I had a warranty, I still felt that I had just bought a lemon, and it left a sour taste in my mouth all together.

Well about 2 years into the ownership, we're fed up. We take the Galant to get traded, only to find that the resale value on Mitsubishi's suck.  We are both educated individuals, so it wasn't just the car dealers trying to get over, these cars really depreciate fast.  We ended up being about 1200 in the hole.  We then purchased or Jeep Grand Cherokee, which is the complete opposite.

Maybe we just got one of the bad cars that came off the line, but whatever the situation was, it left us very unhappy.<br><br>
