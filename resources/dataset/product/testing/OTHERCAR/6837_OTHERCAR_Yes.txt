<TEXT>
            Chevrolet, Ford, and Dodge names that will always bring love, hate relationships in the minds of those of us who drive trucks. I have driven Ford trucks for over 20 years, up until 1998 when I purchased  a new Chevrolet Cheyenne 2500 series for a &quot;work truck&quot;. The price was $6,000.00
cheaper than a same style Ford, so I purchased it. Let me give you the &quot;Good, Bad and the Ugly&quot; in comparison to Ford trucks. 
  Chevrolet 2500 Cheyenne, 350cu/in, 5spd, 410 rear end, am/fm cassette, air/heat,8'bed,extended cab.
  LOVE and ENJOY:
 Chevrolet trucks have awesome acceleration, and power, no comparison to Ford.
 Chevrolet trucks seem to cost less than Fords. 
 Thats where it all comes to a stop:
In one year I will give you the hoe-down on what problems I have encountered with my Chevrolet Truck (63,000) miles.
Drivers door handle latch (broken)
A/c on/off Switch (broken)
Blowout 3rd day, faulty tires
Asian or cheap metal, anything over 200lbs in bed causes dents.
                       hit a small bird and your hood crushes
Inside door handle cracked
Brakes prematurly wore out (36,000 miles)
Over-all: Lease a Chevrolet, buy a Ford
