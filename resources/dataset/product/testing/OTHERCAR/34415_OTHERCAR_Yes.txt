            I just bought a 2000 Tiburon, and it's a great car. I spent a couple months shopping for an affordable, sporty car that could give me the features I wanted. The Hyundai's warranty alone tells you they have great faith in their vehicles. The styling is bold and yet not overdone. The true testimony though is sitting behind the wheel. the steering is precise, controls are very easily reached, and the power is more that enough. Although it has a smaller engine, it works like a larger one. If grouped with the manual five speed transmission, acceleration will push you back in the seat. With items like power windows and locks, and air conditioning as standard features, on a car less than 15,000 dollars, there isn't a lot more i can say. Only problem I personally found, was as the sun would set or rice, the reflection of the speedometer was cast onto the windshield. A minor annoyance but it does get to you after a while.<br><br>
