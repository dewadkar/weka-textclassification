            That's what I said back in the 1980's.  I had been using Canon equipment since 1966.  I started with a Canon FP and ended with the T-90.  In the 1980's I noticed that a number of my photos exhibited problems in focusing.  After talking with some fellow photographers, I determined that my eyes were the culprit. I decided to switch from manual focusing equipment to auto focus.  I would have stayed with Canon, but none of my manual focusing lenses would work with the auto focus Canon cameras.

At this point, I traded all my Canon equipment in for Nikon equipment.  I've owned Nikon equipment ever since and vowed never to purchase a Canon photographic equipment again.

Well, it's now year 2000 and I was contemplating purchasing a digital camera.  I had looked at the Nikon when they had the N950 and I was ready to purchase the N990.  I did some research at various internet sites dealing with digital photography and was almost ready to make the purchase when I came across the Sony DSC-F505v.  The Zeiss lens really caught my attention.  I tossed between Nikon's matrix metering, external flash synch and Sony's 5X optical Zeiss lens.

Suddenly, I heard about the Canon G1.  What intrigued me most was the lack of digital noise as reported by reviewers.  I finally eliminated the Sony because it would only accept Memory Sticks.  Upon further research, I found that the Nikon was more expensive as were the accessories for the N990 (this was not a surprise, because Nikon's film photographic equipment is also more expensive).  

I finally decided to purchase the Canon G1 and have owned it for about one month.  I've noticed that the other reviews here have gone in depth in pointing out the features of this camera.  I just wanted to share my personal process in making this choice.  I am impressed by how long the camera can operate with the batteries.  I also like the compact size of this camera.  Most of the photos that I have taken so far have been in low light situations.  I am very impressed with the output.  I have been printing the images on a HP Photosmart printer.  

I'm not ready to say that it is as good as film, but I am ready to say that I am very satisfied with my purchase.  Over the years, I have felt that Canon was always more high tech than Nikon.  It is not to say that one is better than the other because I feel that the photo capabilities of both companies are very similar.  I think however in the digital field, Canon is currently ahead of Nikon in the sub $1000 price class.  I've heard that Canon has demonstrated some new lens making technologies which are very interesting.

Addition:  1/8/01
A very exciting feature that I have finally tried out is the PhotoStitch software which is included with this camera.  This allows you to take multiple photos and merge them to form a single photo (panoramic view).  When I demonstrated this to my brother-in-law who owns a video production business, he was impressed with the final results.  This feature is not easy to duplicate in 35mm, but Canon has made it very simple.  This feature is a real winner.
