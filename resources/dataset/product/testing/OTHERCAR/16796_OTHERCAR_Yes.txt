            For my whole life....or at least the past 6 years or so, I've dreamed about getting a Chevy Camaro Z28. My dream finally came true about two months ago. I traded my little 4 cylinder 1995 Honda Civic &quot;rice burner&quot; in for my power hungry V8, 305 HP beast of a machine!(A 1999 Z28!) I could talk about how the interior is a little tight-spaced or how the front nose is a bit long, but why bother? The great qualities of this legendary beast outweigh the minor cons of it. First of all, under the hood is the LS1 V8 (Corvette) engine which puts out 305 HP and 345 torque!!! Let me just stop there. For under 30,000 this is the greatest deal in the world for a sports car enthusiast! (which I am;check out my profile!) The performance and handling that you get in this car is a dream in itself. From Acceleration (5.5 0-60) to Braking, this car is a priceless treasure to take care of and cherish. Yeah, it does eat more gas money than I spend on myself in food sometimes, but everyday I ride in it, the unforgettable experience I get is pay back enough.              <br><br>
