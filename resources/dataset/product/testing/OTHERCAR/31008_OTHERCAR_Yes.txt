            Dodge took a chance in 2002 and redesigned some of the exterior and interior features of the 1500 light-duty Ram truck. Many old time Ram folks didn't like it, although it has grown on them just like the last major redesign.

The basic 1500 ST is basic as you can get. No interior carpet and no fancy options, just a work truck. Lots of the flashy options the dealer sells you can be purchased on line or locally. So far I've installed the Mopar Wood Dash kit and CD Player for a fraction of what the dealer would've charged me. 

The ride is decent for a big truck. The brakes and steering are noteworthy. The shocks and standard Goodyear tires could use an upgrade however, judging from the bounce when travelling at highway speeds. Otherwise a drive, 300 miles plus was nice when I learned the in's and out's on my truck.

The standard cab interior is very roomy with the storage area ranking high. Cheap plastic is used here and there but otherwise the layout is excellent. The standard sound system contains 4 speakers; 2 in door and 2 in side rear panels. I purchased a factory CD player and it was very easy to swap out the factory cassette player.

I settled on the 4.7 liter V8 Automatic. The V6 with the same gas mileage and less power or the 5.9 liter which it's power I don't need. It all depends on what you plan to do with the truck and what you can afford.

The 4.7 engine is far from perfect. I've been plagued by rough idle, RPM surges and engine stalls(corrected by leaving the A/C or heat on). Nothing major but still sad being it's a brand new truck. Judging from some of the Dodge Truck messageboards, I'm not the only Ram owner with this issue. Service has been spotty since I've owned the truck. The above issue has not been corrected yet, although I keep trying. Be sure to investigate the dealership you intend to buy from, not only for the sale but for the service as well. I would recommend visting messageboards like pickuptruck.com and dodgetrucks.org for more information.

At 9000 miles, 9 almost 10 months of ownership I'm fairly happy and besides the minor problems described above it's treated me well. Sure the gas mileage stinks but you wouldn't buy a truck if that was your sole concern.
