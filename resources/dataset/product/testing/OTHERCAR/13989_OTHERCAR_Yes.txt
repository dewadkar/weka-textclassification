              I drove a 1995 Honda Accord Sedan for a few months.  I don't think there is a way for this car to have less personality than it does.  This isn't a bad thing.  If you are a driving enthusiast as I am you'd find it lacking in some very important areas.
     
  Braking is rather mushy with lots of pedal travel required to reach the desired braking effect.  Acceleration is good for the engine type.  I only say only get the 4 cylinder as the 6 cylinder is more expensive, and it's extra size means mechanics to do some routine engine work must totally lift the engine from the bay, and we know that translates into more labor costs.  

  On the plus side the backseat is extra roomy with plenty of head and leg room.  If you're a six footer like myself you will find it a little cramped, but nothing that cannot be fixed by moving the seat up a tad.  There is plenty of room for anything you want to carry.  My sister was able to go back and forth to college with very little problems.  

  All in all it's a very good car if what you want is a car.  IF you're looking for something more, try a Nissan.  But if transportation is all you're looking for, the Honda Accord is a great car for you.<br><br>
