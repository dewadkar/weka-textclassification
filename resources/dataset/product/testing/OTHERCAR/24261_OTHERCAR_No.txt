                 I was extremely jealous when my friend bought home a 2001 Acura NSX.  Very jealous.  I had only seen pictures of this car, never had I had the opportunity to actually drive in it.  But once he let me borrow it for a weekend, I wasn't jealous anymore.  I pitied him.  So far he has had his car for three months, and he has already been to the mechanic eight times, from things like a blown fan belt to the Catalytic Convertor pooping out.  This, in total has cost my friend a cool $9,000.00, but luckily it was covered under the warrenty (still, a pain in the butt).

     The Acura NSX was first introduced in 1991, and I have always dreamed about them since that year.  Year after year, it would recieve praise for it's sporty design and overall craftsmanship.  I see none of that in this particular car.  I guess it could have been a bad apple, but I am going to write a review on the car I drove, and beleive me, I didn't like it.

     <b>Stats</b>

     The NSX is a pretty powerful car.  Driving this great looking car is a 3.2-liter, 24 valve V-6 VTEC engine.  With an engine like this, you look for impressive stats, and the NSX seems to deliever.  It gets 290 horsies with a standard trans, or about 260 with an automatic.  It also manages to do 0-60 in 5.5 seconds and 60-0 in an impressive 122 feet.
     The 1/4 mile time on the car is also fairly impressive, at 13.4 seconds (105.9 mph).
     The Acura NSX redlines at 8000 rpms and has a compression ratio of 10:2:1, with a displacement of 3179 cc.
     The NSX gets about 17 city miles per gallon and about 24 highway miles per gallon.
     

     <b>Interior</b>

     I felt that the interior of the car is very roomy with quite a bit of leg room.  The car sits two people comfortably, except for my friend, who is really fat (Sorry Paul!).  I really didn't like the lack of truck space (5.0 cu feet), I could barely fit my Jack Russel Terrier in there, nevermine a nice set of subwoofers!
     I am a fairly tall person, and I felt that I was hunched over a bit while driving.  The head room in this model is 35.5 inches na, which is about 2 inches smaller than most sports cars.
     Another complaint I have with the NSX is the loud air gushings sounds I experienced on the highway.  Crusing at about 105 mph, I heard a loud roar that was really distracting.  I couldn't feel any air coming in, but it still got me mad.  

     <b>Exterior</b>

     Simply put, this car looks great.  Awesome European styling has made this one of the better looking cars out there.  With a rear tail light resembling the Mitsubishi Eciplse, the NSX is everything you could want to look at.  Oh, and by the way, my friends NSX is a bright yellow. 

     <b>Value</b>

     This is where the car loses major starts.  Granted, it is a well preforming car that looks great... but so is the Porsche 911 and the Corvette Z06.  At a retail price of about $89,000 US fully UNLOADED, this car is costs a mint.  Loaded, you are looking at about $92,000 US.  Here is a comparison between the NSX and two other major sports cars:

==Acura NSX : $89,000.00
==Chevy Corvette Z06 : $49,505.00
==Porsche 911 Carrera : $67,900.00

     As you can see, the Acura is the most expensive, but it also preforms the worst on the 1/4 mile and 0-60 times.  And, to tell you the truth, I think I would rather have the Corvette, even for the looks!  

     <b>My Test Ride</b>

     I had some fun driving this car, but I couldn't stop thinking that I had $90,000 at my fingertips.  I decided to take it for a spin on the highway.  I got in, ducked my head a bit and started off.  Tootling around town is pretty fun because everyone is pointing at me (and laughing at "that funny hunchback" as one girl said, refering to my hunched over position).  I stopped at the red light leading onto the on ramp and revved the engine. Sounded good.  At green, I looked around and floored it.  The car took a millasecond, then rocketed forward.  I kept a firm grip on the wheel, my friend yelling "Watch the *$*%%# CAR!!".  I managed to reach 105 mph before I started getting honked at and I slowed down.  It was a good ride, except for the deafening roar in my ear and the lower back problems I'll have for a week now.

     Overall, this is a good looking car with a fairly dated engine, that is easily overmatched by most American muscle cars.  If you are thinking about buying this car...don't.  Get a 'Vette or a Porsche, you will be happier.
