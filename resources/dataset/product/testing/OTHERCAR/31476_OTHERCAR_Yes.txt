            In all, this is an excellent camera. The features and picture quality far outweigh the speed, which I see as the camera's only real shortcoming. Agfa even includes a charger and a set of NiMh batteries with the camera. I bought this camera for $330 (closeout), an excellent deal. No camera could come close to the features and quality at that price, and few can even now. I have spent a day with the 1680 (my dad liked mine so much he bought a 1680) and it builds on the good features of the 1280, and fixes the problems. I also bought a Sony Mavica FD-83 for my office. I chose the Mavica since it does not require download cables and  software, which can get lost when shared between several people. For $700, the FD-83 has the same resolution as the Agfa, and  the same 3x zoom. It does add a video mode, but you can't do much with a 1.4Mb floppy. I use our Sony a lot, and the lack of a pivoting lens really is a limitation (if you get used to a camera with one). My coworkers are impressed with the Agfa, noting that it
 keeps up with the Sony for under half the price. I wholeheartedly recommend the ePhoto 1280, and would buy another Agfa any day. <br><br>
