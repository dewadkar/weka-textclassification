            So, you're looking for a used car and you thought that the No. 1-selling passenger car sold in this country might be a good place to start.  Well, it is.  I have owned a white 1998 Toyota Camry LE V-6 4-door sedan for over two years now and have accumulated 60,000 miles on it. So I feel well-qualified to share with you what owning a Camry will be like. 

As you no doubt know, the Camry has been lauded in the automotive press as a paragon of mechanical virtue. And, yes, it has much to commend it.  The V-6 engine is silky smooth with great reserves of power, given the relatively light weight of the vehicle. Rumor has it that the Camry will sprint from 0-60 in less than 8 seconds.  BMW 323i territory.  I belive that.  Plus, with all the performance, the gas mileage is surprisingly good: I average about 22 mpg.  

Continuing on the theme of drivetrain refinement, the auto-trannie shifts so transparently that you are not even aware of it.  The ride is soft and supple and, although the Camry leans sharply in tight turns, it is smooth and controllable at all times.  The quality of the materials, and their fit and finish, is also commendable.  It holds up well in day to day use.  Nothing rattles.  Nothing has fallen off!  The fronts seats are comfortable and the controls intelligently placed.  The car is still pleasant to sit in even after two hours of rush hour driving. The body styling is certainly not a big draw, but years from now, it should still look crisp and clean.  

As for feature content, the Camry is missing some of the comfort items found in its competitors.  It only has an &quot;auto-down&quot; windows switch for the driver's door.  The design of the instrument panel is innocuous.  There is are no interior lights other than the overhead dome.  The HVAC controls are manual, devoid of any automatic settings.  The driver's seat have very limited adjustments, without a lumbar support.  However, there are some thought features that the competition does not have: adjustable rear head rests and the lights turn off automatically when you open the door!  The sun visors have shades the pull out to block those gaps where the direct sun gets into your eyes.  And, the standard cruise control works flawlessly!

However, the Camry is not without flaws and one in particular really stands out: the brakes!  They are, in a word, NOISY! Everyday!  

From day one, the front brakes on my Camry, which has the ABS that comes standard with the V-6, have continued to gnash, screech and grate on my mind.  I have been to the dealer many times only to be told that these symptoms are due to Toyota's use of &quot;organic brake pads&quot; and that there is simply nothing that can be done. OK, Toyota, then why do other manufacturer's cars in the Camry's price range not have the same problem? The Passat? Nope. The Maxima? Nope.  The Accord? Nope.  Passengers in my car often have a look of shock when they hear these noises for the first time, anticipating that the brakes are about to fail!  Oh, what a lousy feeling!  I feel like I should have some Xanax stored in one of the many cubbyholes to ease my passenger's anxiety. 

This iteration of the Camry has been in production for over three (3) years and yet this brake problem continues.  With such a smooth, powerful engine, and quality of workpersonship it's a shame to have to endure such rude brakes.  Brakes are better felt not heard.

I have owned all of the previous versions of the Camry, starting with the 1985 Boxmobile, and, although signs of cost-cutting are evident on this model (eg.: the hard plastic on the bottom of the instrument panel and glove box), compared with the prior version, it is, overall a very competent vehicle.  I am hoping to get the 150,000 miles out of it that my last Camry gave me.  But, please, Toyota, with all those TV ads of yours trumpeting your legendary quality, give me a brake!
