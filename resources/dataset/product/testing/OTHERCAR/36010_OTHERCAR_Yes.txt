            After much thought and test-driving of other cars, I settled on my used '96 Mark VIII in l0/98 for $20,000 (about half the original price) with about 25,000 miles on it and about l-1/2 years left on the 4/40 full warranty.  I liked its having price-depreciated so much (as they have) as that was to my cost benefit.  I bought it as it looked stylish (tho' a bit Jetsons-like), was very fast/powerful at 275 hp. for my base model, was quiet, comfortable and well regarded by Car and Driver, plus a great used luxury car value.  Now, 4-1/2 years and 27k miles later, I still feel that way.

It's quite a rocket, good in the city, but ideal as an all-day highway cruiser that leaves you relaxed on arrival.  Fast, quiet, fully accessorized and an awesome premium JBL sound system w/ multi-disc Sony changer in the trunk.  Nice LED trip/service computer screen tells me I get as much as 28-29 mpg. highway at 70 mph. if I'm really steady, but only about ll-l2 mpg. in pure city stop-and-go traffic.  Premium's recommended but not mandatory; I usually use regular w/ no noticeable effects or pinging.

I had a number of electronic gremlins in switches, relays and radio, but got 'em all fixed courteously and free at an LM dealer during the warranty term.  The low-profile headlights on the '93-'96 models are horribly dim and cast very little light.  Look for a '97 or '98 model, both of which got a few upgrades, including the pricey, high-discharge headlights which are much better but can't be retrofit to the older models.  I went to 100w. halogen bulbs for $l5.00 each and they improved things somewhat.  The plugs and plug wires went at about 50k. mi., causing very choppy running and half power, but new plugs and wires ended that for about $40 plus labor.  I've flushed the coolant, trans fluid and replaced the front brake pads and tires.

I'm 6'2", 220 lbs. and long-legged, so I especially liked the big doors in this supercoupe and the long, bottom seat cushion which really supports my legs nearly to the knee--a big plus for taller guys.  Also, headroom is good, esp. since I don't have the moonroof, which lowers all cars' headliners by an inch or two.  The eight-way power seat is also great for me.  Yet, even my 5'3" girlfriend can drive the car in comfort.  If you find replacing the original, durable Michelin V-rated tires a bit pricey at about $125 each, you can buy Dunlops by web or mail order like I did for about $60-$70 and they'll work well.

On ice and snow, however, the high power and almost-meaningless "traction control" of this rear-driver make it very tough to get away from stoplights, much like a Corvette, Z28 or similar, esp. w/ performance tires.  The ABS and good, 4-wheel disc brakes make stopping a better proposition, however.  I prefer FWD, myself.

My gold Mark has generally been everyday dependable, has cost me little to maintain and still gets admiring comments from cops and car hikers.  It's not much of a family car, but for a single or a couple, it's great.  While it's again depreciated by about half what I paid, I like it and am keeping it.
