            I have mixed feelings about this Jeep (1998 V8, 5.2 Liter Grand Cherokee Limited).  This article is written by a Motorcycle guy, and the car is registered in my wife's name, so take that at face value.

Though I live in New York City, I wanted to get a good, American-made SUV because my wife was pregnant.  No, I don't go four-wheeling in the wild, but I figured if there was even one good snow-day, I wanted to make sure my family had the reserve on hand, you know?

If I had to pick a car for myself, I would have always selected a Wrangler, because they aren't sissy cars.  So, I figured we would look at the Jeep when the time came for my very first auto purchase.  We looked at several Grand Cherokees, all used, before deciding on this one.

We got it with just under 30K miles, and it seemed like in very good shape (I assume it was just off-lease, but never asked).  Looking under the hood revealed what appeared to be a pretty worn-looking AC compressor, which I honestly assume was replaced with a used unit, but we haven't had any problems there.

The only thing I *really* like about it, is the acceleration.  While taking a first drive, I told my wife "Ok, let's see what it can do", and proceeded to floor the gas.  I was pleasantly surprised as I was pressed back into the seat and my arms stretched to the wheel, while it took off like a bullet.  Score 1 point.

Of course, it drives and handles like a truck.  Well, a little one anyway.  If you are thinking this thing is a car, you are mistaken.  While suspension seems adequate (we got new shocks, recommended in several car magazines), it isn't a soft smooth ride, nor a quite one at that.  It is, an SUV.

The storage space sucks.  Mostly because of the spare tire taking up room in the back.  I can't say how it really compares with other SUVs, but there have been plenty of times when it was a struggle to pack for even a 4-day weekend trip.  Given some of the deep trunks I have seen in modern cars, I bet they come pretty close to the jeep.

When I drive on the highway, I sometimes notice a *very* noticeable vibration, almost a shaking, in the passenger compartment.  It seems almost like the passenger seat is shaking, and you can actually visibly see the shake.  A little disconcerting.

We had a brake recall issue, which our mechanic fixed for free, but now the transmission seems to be slipping, and it can become pretty noticeable (we now have about 44,000 miles on it).  I haven't shopped around, but our mechanic estimates about $1,900 to repair.

Our electric windows also stopped working several times over the summer.  I first noticed it when I drove into Manhattan to pick up some items from work, and I had the Window down, and was unable to raise it back.  After 20 minutes of cursing, I just drove home, refusing to leave it on NYC streets with the windows open.  by the time I got home, they were working again.  This seems a very intermittent electrical problem.

Other than that, it is relatively good.  It's a car after all, and has decent seats (we have the cheaper leather seats, which suck in the summer), air conditioning, and a decent stereo (I believe it is Jeeps top-of-the-line, but I would rate it 'acceptable').

It isn't the most safe vehicle either.  Minivans really do have this section locked up tight, and don't come close to the 'roll-over' issue that seems to have arisen lately with SUVs.  The Jeep seemed 'average' in the safety reviews I saw.

One major choice in purchasing it, was that I wanted an American made vehicle.  Though I purchased it almost 2 years ago, given the recent September 11th tragedy, I am extremely glad we made that decision.  I think an American flag looks pretty good on it.
