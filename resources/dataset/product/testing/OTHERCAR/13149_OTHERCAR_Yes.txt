                      I am not going to talk about the technical specifications of this camera you can review those at www.olympus.com 
I am just going to concentrate on the end results, which are the pictures, produced by this awesome camera. We all buy cameras to take good pictures. If that is your goal this is the camera for you. I have taken hundreds of pictures with this camera, and the majority of them have been awesome. Why do I say the majority? Because the ones that came out with problems were the ones with special lighting conditions or difficult shots that could have been better, if I had taken the time to study the thick owner&#146s manual. 

     Overall regular shots taken with the auto setting are great. One minor complaint I have is that the flash in the auto setting tends to be too bright. However, I have found that adjusting the intensity level gives me good results. In addition, I have read several complaints about the sharpness of the pictures. However, I have not noticed this problem at all in any setting, if you do notice something you can also adjust the sharpness too.The camera has a small LCD window on top of it, which is very helpful to read basic info without using the main LCD screen like the amount of shots left, white balance settings etc.  

     As far as battery life, it is great, you can take a good amount of pictures with one charge of the included batteries. The camera feels solid and it does not look like a toy. The main LCD screen is bright and big and you can also tilt it up and down.  I discovered that by placing one of the screen protectors used on my Compaq Ipaq over the LCD screen, protects it against scratches without sacrificing the detail or clarity.  Moreover, the video quality of this camera is excellent. I have taken great video shots with this camera with no problems. 

     Taking photos in the macro mode is outstanding I was able to take a picture of a tiny flower with excellent detail and clarity. My friends thought I got the picture from a National Geographic website. The software that came with the camera however is too basic for the advanced user. Olympus needs to work a little more on that. I have bought different filters for the lens and the pictures of natural settings like the ocean come out great. One feature I really like is the ability to use a compact flash and a smart media card at the same time, and to transfer pictures or movies from one media to the other.That is great because you can buy a 256 compact flash card and a 64mb smart media card and take 80 pictures in SHQ quality.

In order to use filters I recommend buying the optional lens adapter.If you leave the lens cap on the lens and turn the camera on, the lens will strain against the cap, I do not like to strain an expensive camera lens like this. I got the adapter on the web for less than $6.00 (Check the following website it is great. http://www.wrotniak.net/photo/c5050/lens-adapt.html) 

Overall I am very happy with my decision to buy this camera.  I recommend it 100% with no reserves.  Read as many reviews as you like. One note about some editorial reviews in some web sites is that some of them prefer a certain brand over the other. It seems like they are getting paid to talk about a certain product. My advice is to read the owner&#146s reviews.
