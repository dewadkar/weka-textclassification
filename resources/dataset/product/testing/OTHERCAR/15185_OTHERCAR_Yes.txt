            My wife and I were considering an SUV for the last year. We test drove many of them and thought they were all just ok. I was never happy with the hauling ability of any of them except for the biggest ones which were impractical to drive on an everyday basis (having to park in parking lots and such). I should also mention that I'm a super Toyota owning currently 4 Toyota's. 

Anyway, while at the dealership, the salesman suggested driving a Sienna. Being a man, I thought &quot;No freakin' way am I buying a minivan!&quot; I drove around the block just to apease the salesman and really liked the car. It felt much more like a full sized van than a minivan yet handled and drove like a car. So, the next week, for fun, I drove around with my wife and she and I just finally fell in love with the car. It was fast, good handling and the right price.

I really started to like it when I realized it could haul way way way more than ANY SUV once the seats are out... that is, by volume. Sure, it can't haul a ton of bricks (in weight) but who cares... I wouldn't want to do that in any new car.

And passanger room! We've had 6 adults and one child in there with no problem at all... just compliments!

My wife and I and two friends just got back from a 5000 mile driving trip around the country. After getting back, I'm happier than ever we bought this wonderful car.

My wife (who is not strong at all) can take out and put in all four seats on her own... she has done it a few times.

For all you guys out there (like me), get the spioler, running boards and bug shield and you got a macho looking minivan!

The only bad thing (which is minor) is the van needed an alignment when we bought it.... free of course.<br><br>
