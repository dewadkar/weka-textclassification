            <b>I Saw That Clock Down The Street...</b>

To set the stage for my criticism of the 1999 Buick LeSabre, let me start with a little family anecdote.  Not quite a year ago my father went to a client, a Buick dealer, and decided to lease himself a new vehicle.  After some touring and haggling, he choose a greyish Lesabre and brought it home to proudly present it to my mother.  He led her out to the garage and was rewarded with a terrified scream, &quot;Oh God, that's my father's car!&quot;  Oh yes, dad had unknowingly bought the exact same car as my grandfather.  This is an old Italian's car, and I'll tell you why:

1.Giant Numbers--The most noticeable indication that this is a car for senior citizens with a penchant for the overdone is the incredibly excessive size of it's display numbers.  Over an inch and a half in height, the radio panel is so powerful that you can actually tell the time from the back seat of a car that is behind the LeSabre(this I know from personal experience).  Only someone with severe vision problems would need this size display, and do we really want those people on the road?

2.No Shocks--When you're driving down the road in a Buick LeSabre, you will feel every bump, pothole and small piece of gravel that your tires come across.  If you want to really &quot;feel&quot; the road this car is for you, as you will have a direct physical connection to any item on the road.  If  you're a weirdo like me however and like the luxury of a smooth ride than you need to avoid the vehicle all-together or you will feel like a human milkshake.

3.Whoaaa Lumbar--The LeSabre's lumbar support is best described as excessive, but more accurately represented as painful and annoying.  As
my best friend Vinnie says, &quot;The front seats, while I am sure they are comfortable for a three hundred pound 67 year old man, gave me a nasty
crick in the back.&quot;  I can only echo his wisdom and warn that the effect only grows worse on longer trips, making them virtually impossible.

4.Unicolor--The interior design of the vehicle is an Italian's dream. There is no style with complementary colors or contrasting sharp and soft lines.  With the LeSabre you pick the color you like and the vehicle is dipped into a vat of it...every detail seems to match perfectly.  Everything is large, padded and bulging which once again appeals to Italian-Americans love of physical comfort and opulence.


<b>The Final Verdict</b>

I know that some people will think that I'm cruel for criticizing this vehicle because of it's obvious focus towards and older ethnic market, but that's not true.  While those elements do bother me, it is their effect on the overall driving experience that bothers me more. Uncomfortable and aesthetically displeasurable, the Buick LeSabre is a
driving experience I would rather avoid...<br><br>
