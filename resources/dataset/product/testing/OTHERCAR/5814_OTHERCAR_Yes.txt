            I had been looking for a good quality digital camera and had finally decided on the Olympus D460.  Imagine my surprise when they had just come out with the D490.  An excellent price for a 2.1 mega-pixel camera.  The quality of the pictures and ease of use has far surpassed my expectations.  For the beginner it can be as simple as point and shot.  For the more advanced user there are options galore, everything from an auto-timer to full-motion video.  Set your own f-stop settings or just point and click.  I would recommend this to all levels of photo enthusiasts. <br><br>
