            My husband chose this vehicle, and I am so glad he did.  I was skeptical at first, but now that we have owned it a while - Wow!  I like sitting high, looking down on other automobiles.  I like the punch it has when I need to move fast.  Also, it handles well, it's good for off road and on, and when the roads start to get slick this winter, I know I will appreciate the variable four-wheel drive.  Another bonus with this vehicle is the excellent dash board set-up.  I know immediately when I need gas or oil or an oil change.  Overall, this jeep is a great buy for us 30-something folk.  It has power to take us up to the ski slopes and to all kinds of adventures.  It also has the safety features needed to transport our precious children.  What better combination could you have?  Plus, you won't have to worry about resale value of the Grand Cherokee, that is, if you ever decide you can part with it!
