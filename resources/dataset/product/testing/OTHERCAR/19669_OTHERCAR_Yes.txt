            From a girl's perspective this is one great car and one great company!  I got my Saturn SL1 in January of 1999 and have had no problems with it whatsoever.  The car looks good (Blackberry with dark interior), runs like a dream, handles well and is economical on gasoline.

I purchased the three year service plan from Saturn which saves me time, money and effort. When I moved states this year I received an introductory letter in the mail from my new local dealership so I knew exactly where I had to go when the car needed it's next service (and where to go to window-shop for my next car!).

At all of the Saturn dealerships that I have visited the sales personnel are helpful without being pushy and extremely knowledgeable.  I bought this car because of its appearance, economy and the no-haggle price.  I have not been disappointed.<br><br>
