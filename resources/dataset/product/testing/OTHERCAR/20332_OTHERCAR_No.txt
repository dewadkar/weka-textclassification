            We purchased our '96 Nissan Altima last May in an effort to get our monthly bills down. We needed a smaller car payment and the Altima came highly recommended to us. Well, I've been driving it for the last 11 months and I can hardly think of a single good thing to say about it.

The transmission feels like it is slipping (but we had it checked out and they said it was in perfect condition), after 4 new tires and a front end alignment the car still pulls to the right. I think I have scraped the crest of every speed bump in the Mid-Atlantic region...and I KNOW my tires have the proper amount of air pressure. Overall, the Nissan Altima just isn't a smooth riding car. 

As far as gas mileage is concerned, the car does okay...but moving down from a GMC Jimmy, I totally expected to get EXCELLENT gas mileage. Again, I was disappointed. I'm lucky to 30 miles to a gallon. The norm is more like 26.

Oh, and when they say &quot;compact,&quot; they truly mean it. My husband doesn't fit in it but, since he is 6'3&quot; and weighs 235 I can almost understand that. However, here I am, at 5'5 1/2&quot;, I don't feel like I have the necessary driving room.

Can't wait until we can trade this one in!<br><br>
