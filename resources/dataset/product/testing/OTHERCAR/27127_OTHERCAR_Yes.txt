            My family includes Me, my Wife, 4 boys.  Do we need the room?  YES!  This van is great for a family.  We chose the all-wheel drive model because we live in Northern Maine, and snow is a big issue.  That point brings up a very important consideration with this vehicle.  In snow you need to have good tires!  As with any car or truck; if you get any amount of snow, get SNOW tires, NOT all-seasons.   This van handles well with all-seasons, but tends to slide on the stops and turns,  with better tires it takes on a whole different personality.  I feel very comfortable when my wife bundles up the boys and heads into town on snow covered roads now that we have put on better snow tires. 
The van has a towing ability of 5100 pounds, but with only the V6, it tends to run low on power tackling longer hills if towing.   If you have a lighter boat trailer, or any trailer lighter than 2500 pounds it is easy to forget they are back there.
Getting around town with the Safari is a dream.  It has the room for 8 people (those in the far back need to be skinny.)  There is plenty of storage space in the back for WAY too many grocery bags, or other items needed when traveling with 4 boys ages 2 months - 6 years.  Looking at the far back seat, it is not even worth trying to fit back there if you are even "normal" sized.  With that said, it is perfect for the kids.  If an adult does get back there they will find plenty of room, and ample leg room.  If the car seats are out of the middle seat, I can flip it down to get in the rear and have plenty of room for my 6'2" 250# frame.  Plus my legs even fit (at 37" inseam, I cannot say that about many vehicles.)
Overall the Safari is a stable, safe, well mannered van that anybody with a growing family, or soccer shuttle shouldn't be without.
