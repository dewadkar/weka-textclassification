            Well - not a bad camera at all for the price.  Australian retail price is normally $299 and at that price it doesn't represent great value.  I managed to get it on sale for $199.  So at that price it actually represents very good value.  Handling is good, only thing I can complain about is the lense is too close to the left hand side of the camera, not allowing you to grip it properly without fingers showing up in the viewfinder (and I have small fingers).  

For those with poor eyesight, the dial selector button or buttons on the back of the machine may represent problems being seen clearly, but for those with average eyesight there should be no problems.  Viewfinder is clear and clean.  That is good. LCD is clear and uncluttered and actually is quite bright.  Bonus.  Lense appears to be of a reasonably good quality, good F ratio, pretty good central sharpness, edge sharpness is lagging.  That's normal for a camera in this price range.  I don't have a problem with that.

General usage and menu navigation is fine and intuitive.  Kudos to Vivitar on this.  Features offered is reasonably good overall, even better when the price is noted.  

Overall build quality is also good, whilst not a hardened machine, it's still very good for the price.  Not too large or heavy either.  

Software bundle is very very good.  Again Kudos to Vivitar here.  Installation is very good, and the manuals supplied with the product are clear, concise and easy to read and understand.  Again well done.  

A few drawbacks to this camera (nothing serious at the price point but nevertheless should be noted) -

1.  No optical zoom
2.  Iso Rating is fixed
3.  Not able to choose compression ratio (i.e lossless)

I do know that some of the Vivitar models above the 3640 do offer these abilities.  That is fine - the old saying "you pays for what you get".  I knew that the 3640 didn't have them before I purchased it, and I was happy with that.  Others may not be and should look elsewhere if that is the case.

Camera is rated at an effective 2 megapixels - that is really good.  Good stuff Vivitar for offering this at such a low price.  I shoot all my stuff at the best resolution - 1600*1200 high quality.  That's what i'd suggest others do, but i've also seen images at lower resolutions and they appear fine.  Personally i'd avoid the 3 megapixel interpolated image, it looks worse than the 800*600 one.  Overall image quality (when things are right) is very good overall, excellent if looking at the price.

Now - onto some unpleasantries...

1. Batteries - shocking.  After ten or so shots and one 60 second movie battery was completed drained.  And I wasn't using el cheapo batteries either thank you - Energizer Titanium technologies, about the best on the market.  That is very very poor.  A mate who bought the camera before myself said battery life was poor, but I didn't realise how poor.  From what I am seeing in the market this is extremely poor, nearly ever digital camera offers a LOT better battery comsumption/life than this.  Vivitar MUST improve this.  One saving grace here is that the batteries are AAs.  Easy to find - anywhere.  Try finding Lithium batteries everywhere.  

2.  Shutter lag - absolutely shocking.  Between 1 and 2 seconds at least.  Again this is below industry norm.  If the subject doesn't stay still for that period you'll end up with blur.  Seriously.  This MUST be improved.  

One saving grace is the movie function.  I was very very impressed with this.  Comes out excellent as far as i'm concerned.  It makes up for the inability of shooting images of moving objects reliably with this camera.  

Warranty wise - one year.  That's OK, if fact good given the price.  Bad side?  Well for myself...living in Australia, there is no warranty and repair here.  I have to send it to Hong Kong.  This is very bad Vivitar.  Australia is fast becoming realised as the centre of Asia Pacific.  

One thing I will say - generally Vivitar' website is very good, easily laid out with good access to drivers etc.  Their coverage of new products is shocking though, the Vivitar 3640 has been out for nearly 2 months now and still nothing on their website.  

A real negative and it must be said - poor customer service.  I emailed their technical customer service division 5 weeks ago and did not hear a reply back from them.  I sent a 2nd email 2 weeks after the first one and still nothing...this is shocking and MUST be fixed.  A copy of this review will be forwarded onto Vivitar so that they may defend themselves here.  I'm yet to test what their customer service is actually like since i'm lacking a reply.  This will be interesting.  I suspect poor customer service and would say to anyone purchasing a Vivitar product "caveat emptor" - let the buyer beware.  This is solely based on Vivitar' inability (or unwillingness?) to reply to my queries.  

Overall a very good camera, taking price into account, an excellent buy.  I'd wholeheartedly recommend it for either a newbie to photography in general, someone just dipping their toes into digital photography like myself, or for someone who just wants something cheap.  It's by no means nasty.  Oh and i'm not new to photography thanks - i'm committed to analogue photography at this point of time with au $15k of Canon professional gear.  So I do have an idea of what i'm talking about.
