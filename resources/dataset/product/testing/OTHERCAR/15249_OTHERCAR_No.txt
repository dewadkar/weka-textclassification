            My father was a Union worker under contract to GM who also makes Pontiac.  When they can out with the Grand Am he told me NOT to buy one.  I never did.  Unfortunately, my husband did not heed his advice.  When I buy a car I plan on having it for a very long time so I can get my money's worth from it plus I can't afford to trade it in and take a loss.  We where stuck with this car for eight years and it was horrible!

Two weeks after we got it the water pump broke.  Not to big of a problem except we were on vacation and it broke out in the middle of nowhere!  There wasn't even a car dealership of any kind in this town.  It took two days to get the pump from a Pontiac dealership.  Kind of ruined the vacation.

Then two years into owning the car, the air-conditioner broke.  It wasn't covered on the warranty.  Gee, thanks a lot.  That only cost us about 300 dollars to fix.  By now I'm sure this car really hates me.  One year after that, we have a side-wall blow-out on the front right tire.  Not the car's fault of course.  What was the car's fault was that it didn't come with a tire iron or a jack.  The dealership apologized of course and sold us the set.  See, they couldn't just give it to us because the warranty was up and they where sure it was there when we bought the car!

I could go on and on about all the things that went wrong with this car, like the rear view mirror falling off every couple of days and so on.  The worst thing about this car was that the labor to work on this car was so expensive because of the way they set up the engine.  You can see everything but you can't reach it!  Plus the car always sounded like it was running really rough.  The mechanic at the dealership told us that it was just the way it was made.  He even started up another Grand Am so we could hear that it sounded the same.  It was really annoying, especially when you where going through the drive-thru at Taco Bell!  Eventually the overdrive went out and the transmission wasn't to far behind it so we traded it in.  Needless to say, I got to pick out the next car!!<br><br>
