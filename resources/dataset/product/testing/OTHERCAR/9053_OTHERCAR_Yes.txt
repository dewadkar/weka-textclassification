            My husband and I rented a car--which was the Kia/4 Door Sport Utility SUV. I found the car to be roomy and comfortable inside.  The radio and heating/air conditioning controls were within reach of the driver or passenger. The radio worked well with little to no interference.  The heating, defrosting, and air conditioning worked well as listed by Kia.   The Kia 4 Door Sport Utility SUV handled the road cleanly.  It handled well in good weather, as well as in rainy weather.  It handled the bumps and curves without any difficulties.  I felt safe in this car.  I would recommend it to someone looking for a lower-end price SUV.  <br><br>
