                I was so surprised when I enterd this SUV and found as much seating as  a mimi van.  YOu can fit five people plus three digs in it, believe me..Iv'e tried it.  It is also very cmfertable
     Even the very back seats are worthy of a somewhat long road trip.  I never expected them to be SO comfertable.
     It is also an extremely reliable SUV.  It is built on the Dodge Ram frame so it is as strong as a truk....I can go anywhere and do anything with this car.
   Unfortunatly, it is not as smooth of rids as some of the smaller SUVs out ther but it is managable.  
   I would sugest this SUV anyone who wants the features of a mini van and hummer all in one.
  All areound great vehical<br><br>
