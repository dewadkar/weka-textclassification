            I may never own a car with the character and reliability of my dearly departed 1989 Acura Integra hatchback.  When I was 17 I begged my parents for this car, and luckily they gave in. 

In the two and a half years of owning this vehicle I only had one major problem.  While driving on the interstate my fifth gear just went out.  All other trips to the shop were either routine or caused by my bad driving.

I've never ridden in a car with as much punch as this one.  My car was the first from every light with it's five speed manual transmission.  And continued it's sporty characteristics in it's color, a beautiful candy apple red, and it's accessories a sweet sunroof with automatic pop up wind guard and rims.

Unfortunately my Acura is no longer with me, with nearly 120,000 miles I'm sure that it had many long years in store.  Although as I mentioned before, I could be the world's worst driver, and in a fit of stupidity, I ran a red light and directly into a sheriff's deputy vehicle.  This is where the really meaningful part comes in.  I was traveling 50 mph, not wearing a seatbelt, and hit the windshield on impact.  I had to be bayflighted to a hospital, but only required a few stitches.  It is my honest to God belief that the build and engineering of the Acura Integra saved my life.  To me there is no finer vehicle, and if I ever find the money to afford another one, it will be the only car I'll drive.

PS in loving memory of Red Dog, my beloved Acura who faithfully passed away on Dec 31st 1999.<br><br>
