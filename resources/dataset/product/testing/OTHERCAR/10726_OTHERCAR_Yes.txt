            Saab has jumped into the mainstream with their hugely improved new 9-3 Sports Sedan.  How it sizes up against the competition and who will buy this car is a much deliberated subject in various car review magazines and web sites.  If you are interested in buying this car, read on and hopefully you'll get a different perspective that will help in the decision-making process.

A lot of editorials and reviews talk about the loss of Saab-ness due largely to the lack of a hatchback and the increasing influence of GM.  Let me just say, get over it.  Debate all you want but spend time with this car and judge for yourself.

In the broadest sense, the new 9-3 has been redesigned to compete in the small premium sports sedan market.  This is a very competitive arena with some world-class vehicles.  Saab has taken a unique path in their fight for market share, one that might be just right for you.  In terms of performance, driving dynamics, size and luxury, the Saab falls somewhere in the middle.  The middle can be either a successful balance or a very lonely place depending on your perspective.  For me, it is a successful balance.  Kind of like being a triathlete-good at everything, sucking at nothing.

I have a fully-loaded Cosmic Blue Linear that I purchased in April.  I also added the brushed aluminum interior accents for a sportier look.  The handling is crisp and sporty, yet composed.  The steering feel is lighter than a German car but heavier than a Japanese car and is tighter than the typical American makes.  Once spooled up, the turbo engine really takes off while delivering good gas mileage.  The styling is handsome and taut without being in-your-face or wallflower invisible.  The interior is surprising roomy and comfortable for such a small car and I would venture a guess that the trunk is one of the largest in its class. And safety is for real in the 9-3, not just a marketing slogan.  OK, and one more thing, there aren't a million of them on the road so I don't feel TOO mainstream.  I chose this car for everything that it is, not what it isn't.

So who should buy this car?  If a nicely balanced premium sports sedan is in the cards for you, by all means, take a drive.
