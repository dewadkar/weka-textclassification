Well this is the second car I have owned in my life and I have to say it has impressed me. For three years now I have only had to change the front rotors, spark plugs, wires, new tires, and oil changes.  This <b>1991 Laser RS</b> had only 33,000 miles on it when I bought it in 1997.  It now has 58,000 miles and still runs great. 


<b>Exterior</b>

The car looks great from the outside. Mine actually has a few modifications done to it that make it look a little better than the normal Laser. I have an Eagle Talon spoiler on it, and an Eagle Talon front grill.  The previous owner did this to it, not me.....he said he was turning it into a Talon, and he took really good care of this car. A black rub rail goes around the entire car and joins with the front and read bumpers. Just behind the doors there are gills on the black rub rail that add style to the car. The RS and turbo models come with a hood that has a bump in it which looks sporty.  The lights flip up when you turn them on, and there is also a place to install fog lights if yours doesn't come with them. A DOHC (Dual Overhead Cam) sticker adds a finishing touch to the exterior, located just above the gills on each side.


<b>Interior</b>

I really like the interior of this car. You sit really low in the seat and all the controls are very easy to access. The instrument panel is slightly tilted towards the driver, making it easier to change stations on the radio. All options are available with this car except heated seats and some of the other newer bells and whistles. I have all options on mine except for power seats and turbo.  Everything electronic still works on my car. One thing that has had it is the hydraulics that keep the hatchback up. You have to hold it up yourself of have someone help you. This is a little car and if you are tall you wonï¿½t be able to fit more than three people in this car.....if a passenger is tall as well then you are limited to two unless you want to crunch in. 


<b>Under the Hood</b>

This is a standard 2.0-liter DOHC 4 cylinder car. It gets great gas mileage and also has some power. Another feature this car has is the power/economy button. You save gas for long drives on the express way while in economy mode, and get some extra power when in power mode. Everything is really easy to change and access under the hood. The oil filter isn't in an impossible spot to get a hold of, and the spark plug wires don't run all over the place. 


I have only been in one accident in this car. I was going through an automatic car wash one day when all of a sudden I felt a bump and then the car wash shut down. Turns out there was a big truck stuck somehow in front of me. His car was fine but I has 2 smashed high beam lights, scraped up bumper, and smashed front grill. I made the car wash owner pay for it all so no harm done. Just thought that was a unique little story I could throw in. = )


<b>Overall</b>

Obviously I really enjoyed owning this car. It has been virtually maintenance free for the 3 years I have owned it. The next owner should be pleased as well because I took great care of this car. What am I planning to get after this? Well I won a few scholarships and have a bunch of savings bonds that my wonderful Grandma and Grandpa O', along with a few other people have bought me over the years. So college shouldn't be hard to pay off these last 2 years with my co-op job and all. Yep, a 2001 Camaro SS will be ordered in December.
