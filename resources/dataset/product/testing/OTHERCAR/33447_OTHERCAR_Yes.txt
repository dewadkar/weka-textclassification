            My 2000 Jetta GLX VR6 is the best car for the money!!! With my stickshift, 174 horses, and 181 pound feet of torque available whenever I call, it delivers.  Mine is black with black leather and looks excellent. I have a front end cover and a spoiler.  Truly a great car that anyone will enjoy driving if they love sporty cars....or any kind of car. The Monsoon stereo is powerful and i have a six disc CD changer in the trunk.  The climatronic control works excellent too. No problems so far and the dealership was excellent working with me.
