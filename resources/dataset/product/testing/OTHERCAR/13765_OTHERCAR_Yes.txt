            &amp;#65279;If you are looking for a truck with lasting durability, high safety, and a great price, then this truck is for you. I bought this truck because I needed a vehicle with lots of room, 4 wheel drive, and low maintenance. 
     First let me tell you what I love about my 1500 4X4 1999 regular cab, short box, auto transmission Dodge Ram. First of all, it has never caused me any type of extra service for maintenance. If you live where you need four wheel drive ( like I do so badly here in northern Iowa) its easy access shift stick allows you to push it into 4 wheel while you are driving. Although it did not have the auto-4wheel luxury of some cars it comes with a great price. The second thing you will love is how roomy it is. Being 6'6'' 250 lbs I need my leg room and this vehicle gives me that and more. It can fit 3 people easily including the driver, and sometimes 4. I often use it as an excuse to refuse people rides. Heated mirrors and auto adjust side mirrors are a luxury. I did not get leather seats or keyless entry. I did have a hands free cell phone system in there and with plenty room for it. It came with a AM/FM radio/ CD player with no cassette compatibility. It came with power locks and windows. The last thing I liked about this truck is that it only cost me 22,200 brand new. I thinks thatï¿½s a great buy. Some things I did not like about this truck is lack of keyless entry. Sometimes it is a pain to fiddle around with the key when you are freezing in the cold. There is little space in the back to put anything except I managed to have a 12'' sub specially made to fit back there and a 500 watt amp under my seat so if you really need a nice system or anything this will work. 
  This vehicle rides very nice but still has some of the bumps and twists you would feel in a truck. It is very high up but is easy to get used to.
  I recommend this vehicle for a person who needs to drive in harsh conditions, or needs to transport things without a large amount of people. I do not recommend this to a large family because of its low capacity.<br><br>
