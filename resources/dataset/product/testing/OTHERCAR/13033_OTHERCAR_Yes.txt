            Recently my family just got the all new Volvo s-80 and each day we are more and more impressed with this amazing automobile. (Our 4th Volvo in the family , 850/850/wagon/S-80)  

First and foremost I enjoy the satisfaction of owning the &quot;safest car on the road&quot; and volvo does not say that for nothing.  This car has never skidded on my even in the wettest conditions.  The wide wheel base hugs the road and corners with ease.  Speaking of ease this car drives itself.  It is almost silent when I turn it on and it glides on the road and breaks with amazing quickness.  

Another advantage of buying the Volvo S-80 is the interior.  Looking at the interior of a BMW or say Infiniti, the inside of a Volvo is extremely nicer both on the dash and the seats.  The wood trim is also a very nice feature.  One suggestion is not to get the too light interior since it might stain too easily.  

The exterior or this Volvo also impressed me very much. This car does not look like any other Volvo it looks like a BMW, as anyone.  And that is where the piece of mind of owning a Volvo comes in.  Volvo has great reliablity (my old Volvo was at 150,000 miles when i got rid of it for this beauty) and safety I mean why go with the more expensive BMW 5 series.  I mean go Sweedish not German...Watch out BMW this car will take away a lot of sales.  <br><br>
