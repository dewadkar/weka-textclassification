            In 1997 I received a new company vehicle, a 1997 Chevy G2500 Van.  It is the cargo version and at the time, they did not carry the Express name as the passenger version did, although it is the same body style.  Chevy started attaching the Express name the following year.

Let's get the ugly part of the review over first.  These vans are quite unmistakable when you see them on the road.  They are HUGE, although probably no taller then older body styles, they sit lower to the ground.  The tail lights are very high up and look kind of goofy.  When an co-worker of mine received his new gray van, he described at as a bloated beached whale.  That's about it for the drawbacks to this van and when you are at work or hauling around 12 people, you really don't need to be driving around in high style.

Now on to all the high points.  First I must point out the van I turned in when I received this one was an underpowered 1993 Chevy SportsVan with a 4.3L engine.  My new G2500 came with a 5.0L Vortec engine.  Oh the power!  I was finally able to drive around with the van in overdrive most of the time.  Even with the bigger engine, bigger van and more power, I was getting better gas mileage.  I now consistently get 16-18 MPG and that's loaded down with racks, equipment and tools.  The longer wheel base makes for a very smooth ride.  It feels like your driving a big Cadillac!  The amount of vision out the windshield is spectacular.  You really get a good view of the area around you.  During the winter, up and down snowy winter passes (like the Rockies, the Bitterroots or the Cascades in WA, ID and MT) I have never felt like the van was slipping from my control.  I have flipped two different mini-vans in icy conditions, but I have always felt safe in my new van.

Some of the nice features, that even come in the cargo van include: daytime running lamps, good AM/FM stereo including speakers in the back, dual cigarette lighter ports, lots of courtesy and reading lights (three courtesy lamps down the ceiling, 6 reading lamps and courtesy lamps in all the step wells) and dual big cup holders on the doghouse.

Speaking of the doghouse, I'd like to mention it is very small.  Chevrolet has extended the hood, so that most everything can be accessed from under the hood, including the air filter.  I'm not sure if the doghouse has ever been removed and it sure isn't in the way.

I've had two problems with the van in the past three years.  First, at 42K miles (one year and a half), the transmission self-destructed.  The warranty ended at 36K and Chevrolet did not want to stand behind it.  Being a fleet vehicle, the fleet administrator put pressure and Chevy and they finally re-imbursed the cost.  It now has a SRTI remanufactured engine that I have put 68K miles on with no problems.  The second problem was a bad EGR valve at 92K miles.  That cost about $250 to repair.

Overall, the Chevrolet Express van is a great value, great drive and very under-appreciated.  People who want this type of vehicle, go looking at mini-vans, that generally cost more, have much less power and space and in my opinion are much less unstable (narrower, shorter wheel base, making them top heavier).

Today the van has 110K miles on it and it stills drives like new.  When I am scheduled to receive a new company vehicle, I plan on buying this own to keep for road trips, it's perfect!<br><br>
