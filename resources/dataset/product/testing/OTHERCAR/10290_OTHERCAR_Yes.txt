            (Updated Sept 23, 2002 with additional information.)

I had a 1978 Porsche 924 for about 10 years and enjoyed its practicality, economy and "tossability." The clutch finally died and I swapped it for a 1993 968, which I have now had for 2.5 years.

I really like the 968. It has beauty, power and practicality, and it is not something that you see on every street. In fact, when I tell people that I have a 968, the usual response is "What's that?" The general public remembers the 944 and the 911 is as well known as movie star, but the 968 came and went without leaving an impression. It is the forgotten Porsche.

For those of you unfamiliar with the car, it was built from 1992 to 1995. It replaced the 944 and incorporates styling elements from both the 944 and 928. The 968 was, in turn, replaced by the Boxster.

All versions of the 968 use a 3-liter, four-cylinder, 16-valve engine that is rated at 236 horsepower. It has balance shafts for smoothness and variable valve timing for both economy and power. The car was available with a "Tiptronic" automatic transmission and a six-speed manual. I have the manual and it shifts pretty smoothly, although the clutch is very touchy in 1st gear takeoffs.

The power available under my right foot always surprises me. Once you get the car past 2,500 RPM, the engine is as sweet and smooth as any I have experienced. At 3,800 RPM, my car seems to kick into warp -- the power is outstanding.

At the other end, the brakes are awesome -- without question, this car has the best brakes I have ever experienced. With huge vented disks at all four corners and ABS, the brakes on the 968 feel and stop like nothing else.

Although at least one reviewer has complained about space, my coupe is an excellent car for a couple to take on a road trip. (The cabriolet has less interior space than the coupe.) My wife and I took the 968 on a week-long trip and had room for everything we wanted to take, with space left over for flea marketing. Milage averaged about 25 MPG on the trip, too.

A neighbor has both a 1993 Miata and a 2001 Corvette, and I have driven both. Both are fun rides in very different ways, but the 968 coupe is MUCH more practical than either. (Both the Miata and Corvette are convertibles.) You can fit two adults and a 10-year-old child in the Porsche, and still have room for groceries. This is impossible in my neighbor's cars. 

From a power and handling standpoint, the 968 beats the Miata hands down (the 968 is MUCH more expensive, after all) and holds up pretty well against the newer, more powerful Corvette. Of course, I paid $18,000, and my neighbor paid about $50,000.

The car has a light gray interior with firm and supportive leather seats and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. There is an enormous removable sunroof that has a motor that tips it up in back for ventilation. I almost never remove the sunroof but I frequently use the tip-up feature, which works very well. 

The feel of the steering is excellent and the car handles turns at speed without any sense of lean. The ride is firm, like you expect in a sports car, but it is not too punishing. The gauges are excellent and my car has a thermometer for the outside temperature, which I enjoy having.

Maintenance is a mixed bag. Tuneup stuff is very easy and the oil filter is also easy to replace. However, draining the oil requires removal of an aerodynamic cover from under the engine and this is a pain. I'm very surprised that Porsche didn't put an oil-drain port in this cover.

I bought the car used and I now know why it was sold by the previous owner. It had a baffling stalling problem that happened VERY intermittently -- it might happen in a couple of days or it might happen in six months. The car simply died and would not restart for about two minutes. It then restarted and drove perfectly normally, as though nothing happened. The next occurance could be days or months away.

I got several opinions about this problem, a couple of which were mutually contradictory. The last opinion, from a very experienced 944/968 mechanic, was to try a new DME relay (a $25 part). That was about eight months ago and it has not stalled since. I have my fingers crossed!

I'm now updating this review in September 2002 and the car has still not stalled since the replacement of the DME relay. Since it is a year since the replacement, I pronounce the repair successful and the car no longer has the stalling problem.

This update is written on July 21, 2003. After owning this car for 2.5 years, I decided it was time for a brake job. Although the brakes felt and worked fine, the front rotors were worn beyond their wear limit and the rear rotors were close to the limit. The car had 92,000 miles on it and I think these were the original rotors. The parts for the brake job (rotors, pads and pad-wear sensors at all four corners) cost around $400 from a mail-order company. I did the work myself and had no problems.

However, on my first drive after completing the brake job, the car's heater control valve burst open and all the coolant shot out of the engine. This stranded the car, my wife and me about 10 miles from home. Shortly before the heater control valve failed, I heard a couple of clunks from under the car on the passenger side but didn't think much of it.

I got a new heater control valve for $16 (that's right, $16) from a mail-order company, but had to pay $25 for overnight shipping. Replacing the part took about 90 minutes. Of course, I had to add a bunch of coolant, too.

On the test drive to see how the new heater control valve would hold up, the clunking under the car was painfully obvious. I immediately drove it home and found that the rear bushing on the front control arm (passenger side) had completely failed. The part cost $70 (from a local supplier) and the repair took only about 40 minutes. I believe that this part failed because it was covered in oil from a minor engine oil leak. Time to get at the oil leak! Unfortunately, this bushing affects the front-end alignment of the car, so now I need an alignment.

I hope this is the end to this recent rush of repairs! I drove the car to work this morning and it was fine.

I really like the car. It feels solid, drives great, has plenty of power from a free-revving engine and (other than the problems referred to above) has been very reliable. The 968 coupe is a sports car that actually works in a family, as long as you have a more traditional "grocery-getter" in the stable.
