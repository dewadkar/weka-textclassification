            If you are impressed by what the Subaru Legacy Outback has to offer, but finding that is is a bit too much car for you, the Impreza Outback Sport is a fun to drive alternative. This car offers superb handling, quick acceleration, and all wheel drive, all the time! 

Before this sounds like  an ad direct from the Subaru itself, let me digress by telling you how well this vehicle has performed in real time. This car can climb a steep mountain pass with 4-5 inches of snow and ice on the ground better than most. I had it up to the unbelievable speed of 60mph on a steep, straight climb. The side mounted pistons help eliminate much of the turbulence a fast moving, hard working vehicle can produce.

 This makes the car very smooth for it's size, and 100mph can feel much like 75mph, as several state troopers have made it painfully clear. I purchased this car from the dealer. Subaru offers a great product, and I don't hesitate to recommend Subaru to anyone.

 Specifically, this model is good for single people, or married couples with 1 or less kids. I don't recommend getting your used  Subaru its scheduled maintainence at Subaru, since it is prohibitively expensive; go to midas for brakes,etc, unless something breaks prior to it's scheduled replacement. Buy Subaru! Great car! Get the oil changed elsewhere.<br><br>
