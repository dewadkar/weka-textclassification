            I would not think of Honda when it comes to 4 X 4 jeep type off roaders. 
Landrover,Suzuki and Chrysler Jeep yes! 
it now seems every motor manufacturer wants to jump on the offroad bandwagon and build a 4 x 4. 
But the Honda CRV is a nice little car as well as an off roader. I compare it to the Rav 4 and BMW or Mercedes offering. 

Special edition models of popular cars usually add a number of extra equipment items for little extra cost and that's exactly what Honda offers with its HR-V 'Special Edition'. 
It comes in 2 flavours of Jeep. A 2 Wheel version and a 4WD version. The difference in Price is only ï¿½500 to. 

Exterior. 
--------- 
It looks like a high wheel base car with its 16-inch alloy wheels, a rear spoiler, integrated roof rails and body coloured side sills. Add to this a solid Spare Wheel cover coloured to the car as well and you have a very smart looking vehicle. 

Ergonomics and Practicality. 
---------------------------- 
My Wife drives one of these at work and she loves it. Working as a nanny, she has to get 2 small children in and out of the car. In her Renault, its a struggle with bending over and lifting the heavy little people out of the car. 
With the Honda CRV, there is no bending down as the vehicle is much higher. 
I think this is why so many mothers drive them to school to drop off their little ones. 
Its suitable for such operation. 

Around town it is excellent. Its not too big for parking in tight spaces and the power steering helps out. One thing that does count against it is the lack of rear visibility. 

These days, there seems to be a 'lifestyle' machine to suit virtually every type of car buyer. 
You could call it a 'lifestyle' machine for the parents at the school gates. 


Safety was a priority for the HR-V's designers and the car's bodyshell has been engineered to minimise body deformation and the impact on passengers in an accident. Safety is even more paramount if you are carrying other people's children. 

Inside the car. 
--------------- 
The cabin is as stylish as the exterior with its large blue speedo and rev counter dials nestling under a deep recessed dashboard. Like all Hondas, the HR-V's switches and controls are as easy to operate as those on a child's toy and it's all put together with the precision of a Swiss watch. 
The seats are finished in a wonderfully soft fabric so there is no chaffing in the summer to your bare legs. 

Extras. 
------- 
Essentials include: 
power steering 
twin airbags 
air conditioning 
electric windows and door mirrors, 
anti-lock brakes, 
remote central locking 
RDS stereo are all standard kit. On the practical side there are split/folding rear seats so owners can squeeze long items into the car. 

Servicing 
--------- 
The car shouldn't break the bank to run thanks to Honda's lengthy 9,000-mile service intervals. 
No big bills form the garage. 
Fuel consumption of around 33mpg cant be bad around the guzzling town roads. 
And just in case you are worried, there's a three-year/90,000-mile warranty. No worries from the manufacturer about the car breaking down. 

Overall. 
-------- 
If you're looking for something that's fun, stylish and neatly packaged, the Honda HR-V Special Edition is well worth a look.
