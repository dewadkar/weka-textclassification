            My camera broke last year.  For Christmas I stressed to my loving husband and my twin sister that I wanted a nice camera.  Not knowing me as well as I assumed both of these people would, they purchased this digital camera for me.  I was less than excited, however, decided to give it a shot.  My main concern is that I wanted a camera that would allow me to take pictures of my children and put them in a photo album.  to me it didn't seem this was the answer.

Much to my surprise this camera has come in handy and I have come to love it for what it is - a handy computer accessory.  It is wonderful for snapping pictures and sending them real time via email to all of our loved ones.  The camera is easy to use and not all that difficult to figure out once it is attached to the computer.

The software included with it is not that great.  For the price of the camera, it is decent, but doesn't do much when it comes to detailing the pictures.  If you want to spend quite a bit of time putting peoples faces on other bodies for fun - it is all you need. There are plenty of the &quot;photo fantasies&quot; included with the software.  Another downfall is the resolution.  Again, for the price, the resolution is not too bad, but unless the picture is taken in just the right environment and from the precise distance, the image is very grainy.

Over all, this toy has brought me hours of fun in sending pictures to my family, but it could not provide me with my much desired scrap book pictures.  

As an afterthought, my birthday was this past Monday and much to my surprise, my darling twin sister bought me a really nice camera which will give me photo quality pictures.  Perhaps my complaining worked for once!!<br><br>
