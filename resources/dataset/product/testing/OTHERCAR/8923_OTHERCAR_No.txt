            We bought this 1998 Dodge Caravan because we needed a minivan with a budget. We bought it used. It had 11,000 miles on it. I was personally looking at a new one but couldn't afford it.  They had this one on the used lot.  The price was right. 

When we first got our van I was happy. Now that we have had it for a period of time, we grew to hate it. We have owned a Dodge before and was involved with a head on accident and knowing how it held up made me feel safe with buying another Dodge product. It gets fair gas mileage. This is a basic model with Power windows as my luxury. Holds seven passengers, with the two back seats as removeable.

This van has had 5 belts, 3 heater cores & a new transmission all in less than 2 years (40,000 miles).

The first belt went out in only 17,000. Then a month later it did it again. The following week another one. And you get the idea!!!

The heater core went out around 25,000 miles? We were in shock. They also didn't even give us a loaner, kept it for 2 weeks.  Then before it even left the shop, they didn't have it done right and had to put another heater core in. Well we just moved recently to Oregon, and within a week of getting here, it went out again (in less than 9 months), and now it was over the 30,000 mile warranty. They told us that it would cost us $1000! Even though they found out it was NOT assembled and correctly put in the first time. They kept it for 5 days! And we had to rent another van!

Within days of it hitting 40,000 miles the transmission went out, completely. They told us that we would have to pay to have it done even though it was unusual for any of their automobiles to have a transmission go out. Until we found hundreds of articles & posts saying opposite. We told them that they were going to fix it but that we would have to pay the $676 in labor. They kept it for a couple of days and now it is a high performance type transmission. It is loud and jerky. You can feel the whole car move when you drive down the street and the transmission is changing its gears. They said this is normal. While my husband was waiting for them to pull the car around there was a lady that hadn't even had her 2001 Dodge Caravan 2 weeks and her transmission also went out.

The dislikes that I have are that this van has too much inside noise. It is not a quiet ride. My other quarrel is that when I went on a long trip I had problems with the gas pedal position. By the time I got to my destination my foot was in serious pain. I would recommend getting cruise control if you bought this year and model. My husband didn't believe me tell he did the majority of the driving this last trip and his foot hurt also, and he is a long distance truck driver. The seats take 2 people to move but then they can easily be rolled by one person.

I would recommend another company minivan. A company that can fix there vehicles and make a quality one at that. I would NOT recommend any Dodge Caravan. 

We are trading it in as soon as possible and going with Honda. A family shouldn't pay $16000 for a vehicle that they can't feel safe in or be able to take it for more than a half hour drive and wonder if it will break down. With huge expenses.
