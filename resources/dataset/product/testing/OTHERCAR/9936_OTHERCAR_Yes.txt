            My car is still going strong after 5 years of driving across the country at least 6 times and a 40 mile one way commute M-F. I purchased this car in 1995 after having purchased a brand new Neon....I fell in love with this car from the first time I sat in it...power everything, they way the seat held me, the layout of the dash, (ive yet to find a car with a sensible dash controls} and a sun roof...what got me was that everything was padded inside, the Neon was cookie cutter hard  plastic. Granted the Neon was a four door, but it was just me and my 6 year old daughter, so this car was perfect! Shifting is a dream and it is very responsive.!!!  I traded the Neon in and drove off in my Mazda, I love driving this car!! Repairs include, the window switch on the Driver's side replaced, bushings in the steering, and new ball joints on the front. The car had 43,000 miles on it in '95 now it has 117,000. Since then Ive married and drive our chevy 2500 now, my husband uses the car for driving to and from work, he absolutely loves it (he is 6'1 and fits although a bit snugly). It does need a new paint job badly, but for a  commuter car it does the job!
I would recommend this car as a second car for fun and commuting, for a single person looking for a distinctive and reliable car. I have seen 93's around that have been painted and "restored" and they are just beautiful!  
**UPDATE!!** 1/2003 Car is still going strong!! It now has 139,000 miles on it!! The only things that need attention are the front left cv joint and the sun roof (it opens and closes very slowly and sometimes stop altogether) and of course the paint..since this is our second car used for commuting its low on our priority list..It gets great gas mileage (Hubby figured about 30-40 to the gallon). Great car!!
