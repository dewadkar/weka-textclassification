            One thing i've never liked about SUVs is that they don't quite specialize in anything.  Bear with me for this explanation.  Vans specialize in storage - especially the type of van most cable technicians drive.  While they aren't anything special to look at, you can transfer the most the fastest.  Sports cars specialize in looks - the slick and smooth look and even feel of a sports car is it's defining quality.  Sedans are the perfect family car - everything you could ask for when on a car trip with annoying, ungrateful, petulant children is there and in excess.  Trucks (F-150 et al) are great for their power - I don't see a Sedan pulling my Nitro 205 boat.  

SUVs on the other hand, while good, don't have any specific features that make them stand out.  They're just 'decent' in every area.  Decent storage, decent for families, decent looks, etc.  I could never own an SUV because I can't be driving the "I do everything decent" vehicle.  

Before you figure it out yourself, yes I did formulate the above argument out of nowhere.  However, does that make it any less true?  

To get to the vehicle in question, the 2002 Isuzu Rodeo Sport, the car comes in 2 and 4 wheel drive versions.  I rented the 4 for myself while in Greenland.  They're cheap over there.

If you're buying a 2WD, it comes with the following: 2.2 liter four cylinder engine, and a hard top for only 16 grand.  I of course, did not buy this version, but this information was still added to my review for the purposes of  being informative and complete.  Mwooah!

The Rodeo Sport comes with alloy wheels, a six CD changer, air conditioning, power windows, mirrors and locks, some amazing floor mats (more on this later), and a net used for whatever the heck.  

<b>Overall Impressions of the car</b>

Outside of my dislike of SUVs in general, the car was OK for an SUV.  It isn't nearly as classy as a Jimmy, nor does it have a cool name like "Ford Explorer".  But, it's still OK.  Easy to drive, seats about 5 people over (add however many bodies in the back).  The air conditioning is cool (haha,kill me!), you can switch 6 CDs (haha,kill me!), and all that stuff.  A great vehicle, go not buy it.

This is my first ever car review.  Apology if its low on detail or analysis - do comment and fill me in on what I should do instead.
