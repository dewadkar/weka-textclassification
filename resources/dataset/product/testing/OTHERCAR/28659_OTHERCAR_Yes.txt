            We had wanted a digital camera for a long time, but with a limited budget, 
our choice of cameras was small.  After reviewing all cameras in our price range, the Kodak DC200 Plus appeared to be the camera that would most meet our needs while staying within our budget.  

We have been pleased with the overall quality of the photos from this camera.  The camera is easy to use, settings are easy to change, and uploading pictures to your computer is easy, though the transfer rate is slow.  

This camera, unlike some other Kodak models, can be used with an optional lens kit.  While we have not purchased the lens kit yet, we do have plans to obtain this lens kit to provide us with a greater range of picture taking abilities.  

One accessory I feel is a &quot;must have&quot; is a card reader.  The card reader is capable of doing a full format on your memory cards, while the camera just does a quick format.  Our first flash (memory) card was corrupted when the batteries died (not something that will always happen, but can happen) and we had to send the card to Kodak to have it reformatted.  Another must have accessory is rechargeable batteries as the camera does go through batteries.  

I would recommend this camera to the amateur photographer who is looking for a good starter camera or someone who wants an easy to use digital camera.  <br><br>
