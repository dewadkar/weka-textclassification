            I recently went on a trek to purchase a digital camera.  It is like buying a computer.  Each camera varies to the individual's needs.  My needs were that of an around the house point and shoot camera.  I researched indepth and had the field narrowed down to 3.  The Kodak DC215, the Olympus 360 and the Fuji 1400.

In researching, the other two were serial transfer whereas the Fuji works with the computer's USB to basically create a removable disk.  So that leaned me towards the Fuji 1400.  Although the Fuji does not have the TV link the other 2 had, but I was able to deal with that.

The Fuji houses a 6x total zoom, 3x optical and 2x digital.  I has flash modes that are selectable to the surroundings.  The price was around the same as the other two.  Here is a more detailed explaination:

CAMERA:  The Fuji 1400 is sleek and comfortable to hold.  It uses a zoomable viewfinder allowing you to shut off the digital display during picture taking to save on the batteries.  Once you open the lens cover and turn the camera on, the lens is motorized out.  This concerned me.... a moving motorized part that can go bad.  

SETTINGS:  The camera has a total of 6 image settings.  Basic, Normal and Fine in the two resolutions of 1280x960 and 640x480.  The 640x480 is what I figure to use most of the time.  With the 4MB card that comes with the camera, it will hold 44 photos on the SmartCard at Normal 640x480.  I purchased a 16MB card in addition raising that to 163 images at the same setting.  

I do not recommend the Basic setting.  I used the camera at a party and had it set at BASIC 640x480.  The close up shots were ok, but the room shots were not that good, a little fuzzy.  Also, the camera uses red-eye.  Don't forget to set the flash to that.  I forgot and got red eye in a lot of the picks.  Not the camera's fault, but mine.

BATTERIES:  Have extra AA's on hand.  I put the batteries that came with the camera in it when I opened it up.  About 40 pics later after playing with the camera, the low battery light came on.  But, the camera I got came with metal hydride rechargable batteries and a charger.  Once fully charged, they lasted the 78 images that I took at the party as well as all the showing of the cameras display.  But it does not hurt to have extras.

SOFTWARE:  The software that comes with the camera is pretty basic.  Adobe Photo Home Addition came with the camera as well as it's interfacing software.  It was confusing to load, as there is no ONE setup.  You have to install all the programs seperately.  Once installed, the camera downloaded 78 images in 5 seconds.  Now that is a PLUS!

While taking pictures you can review them and delete the ones you don't like.  The LCD display is smaller than most and is hard to see in bright light.

All in all the camera is a good beginner camera for the non-professional shooter.
