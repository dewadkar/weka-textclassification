            We bought a 2001 V70 2.4T with the versatility, touring and leather packages to replace our '92 Volvo 740 Turbo wagon.  The honeymoon lasted less than 24 hours, here's why: The day after bringing the car home we had a dead battery.  It took three visits to the dealer, during which they had the car a total of 22 days (out of the first month we owned it) to discover the fault - a bad alternator which drained the battery when not running. They also had to replace the steering differential (it caused the steering wheel to jerk several times while starting or stopping).  Condensation in the right headlamp (fixed on the second visit), rear door rattles from speakers (fixed on the second visit), chipped wood trim at the corners of the door handles (both driver and front passenger doors, the roof rail trim on both sides oxidized and became rough and spotted in the first month (the dealer said they'd seen this one before and ordered new rail trim immediately).  This all happened within the first three months of ownership, and we baby our cars - no rough treatment here, just poor materials.  We believe this is Ford ownership leaking through.  Had we any idea of what was in store for us, we would have gone with our second choice, the Volkswagen Passat wagon.  The positives: the car looks great inside and out, and is very comfortable to drive.  We love the cargo net that came with the versatility package and keeps our dogs confined to the cargo area.  The auto-dimming rear-view mirror is slick.  It's got lots of pep and good gas mileage.  It's quiet (quieter than the non-turbo model which has a noisy exhaust system). The automatic climate controls are beautifully designed. Ah, but here are some more negatives: the low sweep to the windshield is awkward when getting in and out of the front seats, or poking your head out the window (whack!) when backing up. The radio controls are not intuitive.  It doesn't hug the road on fast acceleration, tending to hop and skip around instead (more noticeable if already traveling at faster speeds and needing to pass, for example). The rear seats sit high (as did our old Volvo's), which leaves the rear passengers feeling a bit too tall.  Will we get another one in four years? Probably not, if Ford is still owner and quality is still "job undone."
