            My wife and I researched a new minivan for quite some time before deciding on attempting to purchase an Odyssey.  We really did have to work at the purchase of this.  It was very difficult to find a dealer that had one to look at never mind one to purchase.  After reading the safety reports and looking at the competition we went after finding one to purchase.  I ended up being very lucky and finding a dealer through Carpoint.com that had an EX model coming in in a few weeks.  He sent me the price (MSRP + some options) and we made the deal in an hour or so. It was an easy buying experience due to the fact that we weren't playing around with prices or financing deals, etc.  I am not sure what the availability of the 2000 models will be, but I have heard Honda will be significantly increasing production for the upcoming year  On to the car.....
We have owned 3 different kinds of minivans over the past 5 years, so we knew what we liked and did not like about these cars.  We were interested in the safest vehicle possible.  We were interested in having room to move around and spaces to move in.  We wanted easy access to the back and space to move things with the van.  I also wanted to make sure that there was sufficient power to be able to navigate in traffic on the highway.  After looking one over and driving it around, I was very impressed that this vehicle met or exceeded each of our collective needs as a family.  The room seems tremendous!  There is great room between seats and you can move the second row seats from captains chairs to a row in under a minute.  The back row seats three easily and has an ingenious shoulder seat belt for the middle seat that comes down from the ceiling.  The now famous back row folds down and back very easily to give you tons of room to move stuff with.  The great thing about the seat is that it folds down flush to the floor to make it very easy to slide stuff in and out.  When the seat is up, it creates a large well area in the way back to put bags, strollers, etc.  It is also very easy to move from one part of the van to another.  Of course, cupholders everywhere and an extra power outlet in the back (for our cooler).  I nearly forgot the power sliding doors!  These were my wife's favorite feature by far.  It makes it incredibly easy to get the kids in and out of the car.  

This van has a Camry V6 engine that gets up to highway speed quickly and quietly.  It maneuvers easily in both highway and city traffic with good lines of sight throughout.  The driver's seat has the feel of a pilot's chair with the ability to move in almost any direction ans is quite comfortable. My only complaint about the seat is the armrest on the door.  It is hard and not well cushioned.  This tends to bother me on long trips.

This is by far the best minivan I have owned and comes close to the best car I have ever owned (my 85' GTI has some sentimental value for me)
