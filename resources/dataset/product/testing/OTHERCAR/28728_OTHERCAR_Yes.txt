After getting into a wreck a few months ago, we were forced to buy a new car. Being that we are a family with a new baby, money is short. We hadn't expected to buy a new car anytime soon. We owned a 87 Toyota Pick Up before the Eclipse, so this was a huge improvement for us!

My father personally knows a local car dealer that he recommended us to. We were in a wreck on Friday. My husband was in the military at the time of the purchase of this car. The military base was an hour away from home, so we had to have a car by that Monday. As many of you know, in the military you can't just call in with a broke down vehicle. You must find a way there. So, down to Joyner's Auto we went. Being that we didn't have months, weeks, or even days to buy a car we were looking hard for a good deal on a nice car. We weren't prepared for many things and we new that anything would have been an improvement from a small pick up. We searched over numerous cars, more than 20. We asked questions after questions. Because my father was friend's with the owner, we were given a good deal. We were told the truth about every car. From the knowledge of the owner there was nothing wrong with this car and it was a steal at less than $4,000.00. The car was cute, sporty, and inexpensive.

Okay, enough of my story telling. I will tell you about the car now. To explain a few things about this car to clear up any differences in models I have to say a few things. Our car is an Eclipse GS. I don't know what difference this makes, but it does when purchasing parts so it may also be important to you as a reader. My car is a manual 5 speed. This also makes a difference to some.

Being that this isn't a new car, I am aware of some things that are important. Mileage is one. When we purchased the car it had 150,000 miles on it. This mileage seemed like nothing to us. The truck had almost 300,000 miles on it. We looked through the paper work and have noticed that oil changes, timing belts, fluids, brakes, and all other timely maintenance had been done on time. This probably has a lot to do with the great performance of the car. Much like anything you own, you must take car of it. 

When we pulled off the lot with the car, we noticed a squealing noise. I had a mechanic look at it and found that it was the alternator belt. The belt eventually did pop and had to be replaced twice. This had nothing to do with the car, but rather that the mechanic obviously didn't know what he was doing. I was sure we were sold a lemon car after it broke down 3 times within a month. It was only a small problem that the belt wasn't put on properly. The car runs wonderful now and that has been the only maintenance we have had to do.

~~Features~~
We have a sun roof. It isn't an automatic sunroof. You have to open it and close it with your hands. This is no big problem though. My theory with automatic features is that, that is another motor that will someday need to be replaces.

We have automatic windows and locks. There is a window lock feature. This locks the passenger window. This is an excellent child safety feature that I believe every car should have. We do have a problem with the passenger window though. The car is almost 9 years old. With in the nine years, the motor in the window has obviously been worn out. In order to get the window up sometimes you have to pull up on it. The cost to have this replaced is more than I intended, so I deal with it and pull the window up. The automatic locks are unlike any others that I have seen. When you lock one door, the other door locks automatically. There is no way to change this. I have a problem with this. Out of habit I always lock my door when getting out. After locking my door, the other door locks. My baby is still in the car, so I have to unlock the door. I don't understand this feature, and I don't think I ever will.

We have a radio and CD player. They still work wonderful. Everything works fine, the light still works inside. The speakers are factory and more than obviously blown. This isn't something I worry with though.

We have cruise control which is complicated to work and I still haven't figured it out.

The drivers seat has a cushion inside the seat. You can turn the dial and it feels softer or harder depending on the way you turn it. The seats are moved easily. Like most cars, there is a lever underneath. You just pull up on the lever to move the seats forward and backwards. You can also recline the seats with a lever on the side.

There is a trunk release, gas release and hood release button. These are all great, mostly the trunk release. Have you tried getting a baby out the car, with bags of groceries, and trying to get the key in that small hole all at the same time? What a task. All you have to do is pull the release. Now there is a problem I have with the trunk. It is a hatchback and doesn't stay open on it's own. I don't know if there was something that used to hold the trunk open or not, but it isn't there now. I have to use a broom handle. I know, how silly? It is what works though.

The antennae comes up when the car is turned on and goes back down when the car is turned off.

There is a back windshield wiper. This is a must for a hatch back! You would never be able to see out of it in a storm without the windshield wiper.

We don't have the leather interior. It is just a soft plush like material. The seats are extremely comfortable. The back seat is very small. My car seat barely fits in there. I don't know why we didn't check out the back-seat first. There is not a chance that you can fit more than two people in the back-seat. One person in the back seat is pushing it! There is no middle seat, nor seat belt. This is my biggest gripe. If we plan on another child, this car will have to go.


~~How does the car drive?~~

Can I just say wonderful? Of course not! This car has 'get up and go' written all over it. When you say go into 5th gear it goes. It is a pleasure to drive. For lack of a better word, quiet is what this car is. I couldn't believe how quiet it was being that it is nearly 9 years old. The gears are found easily. Before this car, I had only driven one other manual and very few times. This would be a wonderful car to learn how to drive a manual. There is no searching for gears. They are so close together, you can't miss them. 

~~How does It Look?~~

Other than the faded paint on the hood, this is an attention getting car! My car is blue. If you open the doors you can look and see what color the car used to be. The car is certainly due for a paint job. The car is sporty. As you look at the newer sport cars, what runs through your mind? Fast is what I always think. This car says the same thing. Saving you time, you can just look up to your left to see a picture of the car. Wouldn't you drive it?

~~To Sum it Up~~

Besides the little problem we had in the beginning, we love this car! It runs great! Excellent gas mileage! I would give anything for a bigger back-seat and less truck though. 

If I have left anything out, please let me know. Being that I don't know much about cars, this is what I gather from the car. These are things that are important to me. If there is something that is important to you that I haven't mentioned, please let me know!
