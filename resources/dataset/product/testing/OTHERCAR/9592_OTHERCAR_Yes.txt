            This fall I started my sophmore year at UCSB and so I needed a car.  Originally my parents weren't planning on getting me one.  So it would have been the third year after getting my license without a car. Then within a few weeks they did an about face and instead of getting themselves a new car, they decided on getting me a car. 

So began our process of getting a car. First it was suggested I get a Honda Civic.  Are you kidding me? How creative and original is that?  That's almost as bad as a rich Caucasian kid driving a Mustang at my school.  You see one ever 2 minutes!  So I asked for a Accord but that turned out to be too expensive.  Deep down inside I had always wanted a Celica since they came out.  I would make detours in parking lots so I could check them out.  All my friends knew how much I wanted one.  So one day my dad came home and asked me if I had heard of the Celica.  I was on my way.

I will cut through the long story of buying the car.  On the way home I managed to back up incorrectly and my front side hit a concrete support column.  This is important since (besides showing what an idiot I was) it shows how extremely fragile the paneling is.  And here we go with pros and cons.

PROS:
The car is very gas efficient.  It has great acceleration and you can hear the engine which I like alot because it makes me feel faster. The car is very unique on the road, although that is starting to change with everyone buying one.  The car is extremely light. 2500 pounds so this only helps with speed.  The handling on this car is great. I always turn by loading the suspension and my tires never slip (stock) and my back end never gives. I hit corners pretty quick and it's so fun with all the stuff sliding back and forth in the trunk.  The sound system is great. Alot of fellow owners comment on how it is one of the few good stock systems.  So much so that I am probably just adding subwoofer and new head unit and keeping everything else.

CONS:  There are many but every car has some.  The outside paneling is very light. I have seen a Camry hit a concrete wall and it would only scratch the paint. I hit a column while backing up at 1 mph and it dented it causing $600-$1000 worth of damage.  It is easily dented.  The inside paneling is prone to scratching, especially the passenger door which is always hit with the seatbelt buckle.  There are very heavy blind spots that you have to get used to.  The spoiler perfectly blocks bright headlights but it also blocks police sirens, so you don't really know if you should be slowing down.  There are others but most have been addressed by TSB's (Toyota Service Bulletins).

I hope that my cons list hasn't driven anyone away.  Don't get me wrong, I love the car. It's an incredible performer and is gas efficient.  It turns alot of heads and <br><br>
