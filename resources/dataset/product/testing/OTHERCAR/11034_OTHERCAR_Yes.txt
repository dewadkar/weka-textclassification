            The last of the large-frame Caddys, the 1984 was a lovely sight to behold. Weighing in at two tons of massive-looking, sculpted Detroit steel and stretching 18-feet down the driveway, you feel secure in this behemoth. You know an accident that would kill the occupants of any vehicle hitting you would result in mere bumper scrapes on the Cadillac.

The huge chrome egg-crate grill above a massive, gleaming bumper, surmounted by the distinctive Cadillac Crest held high on a hinged pivot, a throwback to radiator caps of yore, loom intimidatingly in the rear-view mirrors of those driving mere Chevys and Toyotas.

Interestingly, a study recently showed that folks will vacate a choice parking spot nearly a full minute quicker if the car waiting to get into the space is a Cadillac or other luxury vehicle. Speaking from personal experience, it's true.

My Caddy clocked in at over 180,000 miles before I sold it. I had replaced both the transmission and the engine once and the air conditioner twice. This particular model (and no others) featured that damned aluminum engine that I'm sure GM regretted putting into production. It was their wink-wink, nod-nod to improving milage figures at the expense of weight and power. (To better understand this shameful period in GM history, see Michael Moore's brilliant documentary "ROGER & ME.")

This underpowered Cadillac DeVille rode proudly high on a "Level Ride" system that gives it a distinctly "carriage" look to my eye. However, those increasingly popular "road humps" to slow traffic on side streets gave it fits, resulting in a harshly jolting ride over such things even at slow speeds. But the smooth and comfortable highway ride simply couldn't be beat. No matter what the load in the trunk or back seat, the Cadillac's air-assisted shocks/struts maintained its perfectly level plane to the road.

With its small turning radius, great visability, massive road presence, sensitive power steering and excellent brakes, this is a safe car that you might consider as a drivable old clunker for work or for that kid who is just learning about driving. (But with its gigantic and comfortable back seat, you may not want your impressionable teenager to have one, if you know what I mean and I'll bet you do.)

You may remember this particular model by the ugly visual created when the cheap plastic inserts used as "crumple zones" between the fenders and the chrome tailfins rotted away, leaving a void in its place, tail-light wiring dangling in the wind. Most of these models had left the roads by the time this inevitable horror happened, but some didn't. Mine was one of them. Every bit of plastic trim used on the outside of the car finally rotted away. But then, it was over 15 years old by that time.

I found replacements for this trim at a place called MUSSLEMAN'S in Houston. Great company, great service.

My Cadillac featured a beautiful mist blue exterior with matching soft, padded, 'leather-look' roof. Medium-blue leather upholstry covered the interior, including the massive dashboard. Everything was power, including all passenger seats! With a tilting, telescoping steering wheel and 8-way power seats, this car can accommodate any size driver, short and tall.

When I first bought this car it would impress people when I'd pick them up at the airport, for example, and as I glided up the trunk lid would magically pop open in a controlled way for their luggage. And no slamming the trunk lid, please. Just close it to the catch and it closes itself quietly and securely. While "extras" have moved beyond this little toy, it sure was hot in its day.

I loved the small details: the cigarette lighters in EVERY ONE of the FIVE ashtrays (and I don't even smoke); the lighted make-up mirrors on BOTH visors; the reading lights that really worked properly; the carpeted waste basket built into the firewall; and the wood-inlaid steering wheel, to mention a few.

I also loved the fact that whenever I'd take it to the dealer for service, no matter how trivial, I'd get to feast on Krispy Kremes, orange mini-muffins, self-serve hazelnut cappachino and other goodies (including peanut-butter stuffed pretzels!) while lounging in a leather easy chair paging through "Yachting Today" magazine. And it would be returned completely washed and dried inside and out.

ASIDE: The funeral home industry had a big snit when GM stopped producing this model, as it was the favorite for hearses.

By the bye, in a story too long to go into here, I got this Cadillac for only $1,000.00 in the late Eighties. It was in perfect, one-elderly-owner, garage-kept condition. I sold it last year to my son for the same $1,000.00.

This tailfined Cadillac will one day be a collector's item and is already valued by the savvy few who understand its importance to the Cadillac design heritage. My son is returning his to showroom condition and it already turns heads.
