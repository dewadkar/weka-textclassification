            I just want to say that I looked for a sports car and boy the Pontiac firebird caught my eye. It is sleek and stylish, it is the most car for your money and I recommend it for any age group who is looking for style and speed. When I drive down the road all I get is looks and smiles, People say &quot;nice Car &quot;, and that in itself is a plus. It handles well and feels like A cockpit, everything is at your fingertips. One down fall is that it is a two seater in the back and the back seat area is very tight. But if you do not care about that than this is the sports car to but. It is priced well and definitely beats out the ford mustang in all aspects. Plus there is just not many of the firebirds manufactured as compared to the mustang. I highly recommend it. If there are any questions just email me and I will respond. oh The T-tops are great.<br><br>
