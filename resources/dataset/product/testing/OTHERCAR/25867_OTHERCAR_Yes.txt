            First of all, I went from driving a '94 Explorer to my 2000 Cherokee Sport 4X4.  I'd say it was a nice upgrade, and don't regret my purchase at all.

The 4.0L v6 produces a good amount of power with lot's of torque.  It's been a solid performer for me with absolutely no problems.  The engine is a little noisy but it's a jeep, you don't buy it for it's Cadillac quiet sound.

The four wheel drive is excellent, especially living in Michigan's lovely 5-6 month winters (it's April 8th and we've got about four inches of snow right now).  Engaging and disengaging the four wheel is soundless.  The only thing you'll notice is a slight tugging on the wheel while the 4 wheel is engaged.  It doesn't make it hard to turn, but it is noticeable.  Ground clearance is great!

Many people like to complain about the possibilities of the Jeep rolling.  I won't deny it, at first the power steering feels like it's overcompensating some times, and this may make you feel a little uneasy.  After a few weeks though, I adjusted just fine and there were no more worries.  Yes, it is a smaller SUV.  Yes, it has a good amount of ground clearance for such a shorter wheel base.  But remember, it's a Jeep.  Nobody should be taking corners at 40mph.  On the highway, I can comfortably take a sharp curve (note- curve, not sharp turns) at about 65-70mph without any worries; however, you will obviously have to compensate for bad weather.

Inside, the room is a little tight but not overwhelmingly so.  Up front you'll be fairly comfortable, but passengers in the back seat may not want to go for long trips with you.  The back seating area is a little cramped, not to mention a pain to get in and out of the back doors.  Having the Sport package, the interior is very nice - for a Jeep.  Jeeps aren't exactly meant for luxury.  Then again, anybody looking for the luxury of a Cadillac or Lincoln better look elsewhere.

Driving down the highway there is definite cabin noise, something you can't get around.  The noise is honestly not that bad, but you may have to turn up the stereo a bit.

Speaking about the stereo, to put it frankly - it sucks.  Even with the better sound package, you'll be highly disappointed.  Don't be surprised if you get the urge to do what I did.  After a month of going crazy listening to the peewee sound system, I replaced the stock deck with a higher performance CD player.  While this changed the sound drastically, the stock speakers just can't handle much of anything.  So I replaced the stock speakers and hooked up some 3way 6X9 speakers and put them in a box.  It made an excellent change over the standard micky-mouse tweeters.  From there I decided to change up to some 12" subs and an amp, but that's another story all together.  In the end though, plan on at least upgrading the radio.

Gas mileage is moderate.  I can usually pull about 250-300 miles from a full tank (depending on highway/city driving).

Final synopsis:  Good vehicle, okay gas mileage, reliable engine, solid performance, horrible sound system.
