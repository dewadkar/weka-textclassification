            This car drives like a sports car.  It is fast and fun.  It also has great breaks that come in handy.  I have taken many road trips in this car, and I didn't even mind the long rides in this car.  The leather seats are very comfy.  They recline with the touch of a button in like 8 different directions.  The only thing I don't like is the back seat.  The left and right sides are ok.  But if you want to lay down in the back seat, there in an uncomfortable &quot;hump&quot; in the middle, that doesn't make sleeping very fun back there. But sleeping in the passenger seat is very easy and comfortable.  The ride is nice and quiet and the sound system is great!

My car has airbags, power steering, alarm, remote keyless entry, leather seats, cd player, air conditioning, cruise control, and just about everything else that you can get.  Even if the car wasn't loaded with all of these great features, it would be a wonderful car.  

The only problem we have had, is that once the oil change light came on and even after an oil change, it wouldn't go off.  That took very little time to fix that, other than that, it has been great.<br><br>
