            Just today, I had the opportunity to drive a nearly loaded Pontiac Grand Am GT coupe at a local dealership.  Now although I never got a chance to really bring it up to speed, I got a good feel for how the car behaves, and I must say I'm impressed.

The powertrain in this vehicle was a 3.4L OHV V6 making 185 horsepower, mated to a four-speed automatic transmission with overdrive.  Starting the car produced an authoritative growl from the six-cylinder, which in turn produced a rather large grin on my face.  The car sounds like it has a lot more power than it really does, although it has quite a bit of power.  Throttle response is good.  It's a tad sluggish at low RPMs, but picks up quickly after around 2000 RPM and pulls strongly after that.  The transmission shifts accurately, and with little delay, being smooth when able, and aggressive when needed.  Handling on the car is also quite good, and brake pedal feel is firm and responsive.  The steering is quick..a little too quick for my taste.  It's too heavily boosted, and takes almost no effort to turn the wheel.  I'd prefer more resistance here.

The interior was intelligently designed, with the controls in easy reach.  The seats were quite comfortable, and the interior was well insulated against noise and vibrations..execpt when you step on the gas.  Then, just the right amout of rumble from the engine gets into the cabin.  That motor sounds even better from the inside than out.  Visibility is also respectable, and the guages are easy to read.  
Rear seats were also good, but were a touch cramped for my six-foot-plus frame.  But even with the optional sunroof, headroom wasn't a problem.

The exterior design of the car is very sporty, and the alloy wheels on this car complimented the sheetmetal well.  However, all the plastic moldings and fairings seem a little gaudy for my taste.

A brief note about the price: As-tested, this car was around $21,500, and this car had every option available but leather seats.  That makes this car a great deal for the money.

In review, this is a solidly-built car with a strong engine and sporty feel.  A few problems hold it back, but otherwise, if it sounds good, why not try it out?<br><br>
