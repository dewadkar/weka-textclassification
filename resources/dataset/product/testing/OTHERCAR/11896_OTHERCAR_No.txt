            Approximately 6-8 months ago I purchased a Agfa ephoto780.  I like the camera generally. It doesn't have too much of a problem with battery consumption, but it does have a problem with indoor pictures.  Outdoor pictures turn out fairly well. Indoor however, have a tendency to have problems with glare, darkness and getting a rather green tinge to them.  We've tried several ways to remedy this to no avail. We usually wind up taking the indoor pictures with a regular 35 mm camera and scanning the images into the computer. All in all, we use it fairly often for outdoor events, but are hesitant to use it for indoor.
