            I have had two of these in the last year. I bought a 1996 Corolla DX in July. This car was the top of the line. It had everything. It drove great, was comfortable and got great gas mileage. Unfortunately, I was in an accident and the car was totaled. However, the airbags worked exactly like they were designed too. I was not injured.

 I immediately began looking for another 96, but as luck would have it, I got a better deal on a new one. I ended up with a 2000 Corolla VE. Compared to the DX, this one was bare bones. That, however, is fine. Less things to fix. The VE is an automatic and the 96 was a manual, but I like both. 

The 2000 is so quiet! People have commented on how quiet it is. The only things I don't like is that there is no overdrive, which makes for a lot of engine noise over 55mph, and that there is no intermittent wipers. One would think this to be trivial, but only having low and high can be annoying. I think there was more room in the backseat of the 96, but for a compact the 2000 is really roomy. 

Driving the car is wonderful. It practically drives itself! I love Toyota and will never buy anything else!<br><br>
