            I bought my vivitar 2750 at a local walmart and I love it! I studied camera very thoroughly on the web before making a purchase and found that this one, being in the lower price category was well worth the money. I use a webtv and very few digital cameras are webtv compatable. They need to have the video out cords to work. Most inexpensive cameras that do have this capability are very poor picture quality and do not have to ability to &quot;upgrade it&quot;. By upgrade I mean using additional or higher level memory cards in them. This camera also came with the batteries and a battery recharger so at a price of $125 I felt I couldn't go wrong. I especially love the LCD screen on the back. I can see my pictures and delete them immediately if they aren't what I want. It is also wonderful because when you are visiting family you have the ability to hook it right up to a vcr or television and show off your pictures. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a first time digital camera and to all webtv users.<br><br>
