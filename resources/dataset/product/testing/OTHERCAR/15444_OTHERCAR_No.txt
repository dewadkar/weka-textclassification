            I got a Sony FD-88 about 5 months ago.  It works fairly well, but here are the problems I have had with it:

It doesn't have a optical view finder, so when one is in sunlight it is very difficult to see the LCD view screen, and see what it is that you are trying to take.

When I try and send a MPEG movie it causes my netscape 7.0 to give a general fault and I have to reboot the computer.  I called Sony but they didn't want to hear about it, didn't care to even record my complaint. In fact I would rate the customer service as poor, they acted like they didn't even want to work there, the two times I called.

If you take the highest resolution photos 1280 X 960 in FINE mode one can only take 3-4 photo and then the 3.5 inch disk is full.  I don't remember any mention of Normal and Fine modes in any literature or on the outside of the box the camera comes in, and the fact that the Normal mode is suppose to be used when the camera is hand held, which accommodates hand-shake, but reduces the final resolution.  They only have JPEG recording format, so the final photo is really not top quality, but with the small 3.5 disk that is about all one can use.  So you need a bunch of 3.5 inch floppy disk to do any real picture taking.
But they are easy to download to your computer, or you can just give them away to somebody, since they are so inexpensive.

You are going to have to buy the more powerful battery, because the one that comes with the camera just doesn't last very long. So you end up carrying around an extra battery and about 10 3.5 inch disks. there isn't any way to connect an external power supply to the camera either.

I like to use the camera but the next time I'll get one that isn't so heavy and has a different storage media, and an optical view finder.
