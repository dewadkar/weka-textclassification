            We bought our Previa LE new in 1991 and have loved every minute of driving it. People either loved or hated the styling of this "Easter Egg" vehicle. We are on the "loved it" side, inside and out. 

Our main criterion in the purchase was the easily configurable space. We've hauled full sheets of plywood, a rototiller, and even a Lazy-Boy recliner in the back of this thing without removing any seats, and still had seating for four! And we've slept comfortably in it with the middle seat removed.

There is loads of interior space and you don't have to remove the rear seats to get it! In fact, you just fold the rear seats flat, pull a rip-cord, and the seats flip up to the sides of the van, to be held in place by an attached cord to the hang-on handles (for lack of a better term to call the things you hold onto when the driver banks a turn too fast or the things you hang your dry cleaning on). The only catch is if you use the van as a second home, which we tend to do, you have to move a lot of stuff in order to fold the rear seats flat so that you can flip them up!

We don't travel lightly. My husband still loves to tell the story about the time we put our Lazy Boy recliner in the back of this van to travel across country to visit his brother (I had a good reason -- really!). That was along with the new first baby's portable crib, tons of toys, clothes, diapers, etc. And you should see us when we go camping! With the middle seat removed and the back seats folded up against the sides, you can fit a 4x8 sheet of plywood in the back lying down flat ... and it's also perfectly flat so you can use a double air mattress (a nod to the "party wagon" review!)... when camping, of course.

We find the cockpit very comfortable and the instrumentation intuitive and easy to read. We call it a cockpit because we've always felt like we were getting into a future-mobile with this van. 

It's only 4 cylinders, but we're test driving 6 cylinder vans now and find our Previa very comparable. I've never had a problem climbing a steep hill at top speed. We're consistently getting 20 - 21 mpg around town and trusted it enough to take it on a 3,000 mile road trip this summer, where we got 24 mpg fully loaded with the pedal to the metal :-)

We've moved this van from California to Texas and now to upstate New York. I would drive this van to its death if it had AWD, or perhaps even front wheel drive. But with its rear wheel drive, I've had a few problems climbing our very steep road and making the sharp 90-degree turn into our even steeper driveway. Just a few times, but enough to where I'm going to sadly trade it in for something with more traction. We're looking at the Grand Caravan AWD and the Montana AWD as replacements. They're OK, but really pretty boring compared to this van and not nearly as flexible or roomy.

With the exception of replacing the alternator at about 125,000 miles, we have had NO problems with this car's powertrain. 

We do have a few other problems. The moonroof cable broke and costs hundreds of dollars to fix. Opening the moonroof is no big deal to us; however, keeping it closed is. We've had to tape shut so it wouldn't slide open, being too cheap to spend ($400 was it?) the money on a cable.

Also, the overhead read AC unit, while a wonderful must-have option, has developed a squeal, or should I call it a squalor -- My daughter, who came home from the hospital in this van and is now 9, says it sounds like a baby elephant screaming for it's mother. It's intermittent, but apparently also a very expensive fix (bad bearing or some such). Toyota says we have to replace the entire unit.

The passenger side sliding door is starting to take a little more energy for our daughter to open and close, but we probably just need to clean the fall leaves out of the tracks.

The spare tire is full-sized (good thing), but held underneath the chassis (bad thing after many years on the road). The padlock that we put on it has rusted shut and I carry a pair of bolt cutters for the day that I might have to use the spare (I'll let AAA do the cutting!).

Otherwise, after over 155,000 miles, there is one tiny rust spot on the back. The paint looks great. The interior has held up very well, despite rampant big, muddy dogs and kids eating fast food. The dash is Teflon and cleans up very nicely.

All in all, this vehicle has served us very well and I would buy it all over again. I wouldn't say it handles like anything other than a minivan. I love driving sporty little cars. But the Previa feels OK on corners -- I never felt like I would lose control, even though perhaps I might drive a little faster than I ought to.

I think Toyota went backwards with the Sienna. The cargo space is not so easy to configure and the Sienna lost the head-turning factor that the Previa has. We've looked it over and moved to other manufacturers, in spite of the phenomenal reliability we've experienced with our Previa.

11/16/01 addendum re:traction
I had studded snow tires on this van and still had problems on the steep stuff (this is VERY steep, folks). Highly recommend this van for people living south of the snow belt or in snowy, but flat, places. I never had problems in the rain with traction, but I use good tires (Perelli P400 touring).
