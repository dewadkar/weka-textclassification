            I have owned a Durango for 2 years. I love it. For the money its a great value. The engine is powerful and always has passing boost on demand on the highway. I live on a heavily wooded lot. I have used my Durango to pull out stumps, haul around a small utility trailer that I have a habit of filling up beyond its sides. I haven't had any problems what so ever with traction our not be able to move the load. 

I have previously owned Chevy, Dodge and one Ford pickup truck. Dollar for dollar, the Durango was a better value for me. I did not sacrifice passenger space for utility. I have the best of both worlds. I have always been impressed with its unique style and curb appeal. It is a muscle truck for a very reasonable price. I compared with Blazer and Explorer. Those two vehicles did not offer the space, power or any real difference in options. It was a matter of paying for the name plate on the side of the front end. In my opinion, this vehicle is the best of all worlds. It is very easy to drive. Its not the largest sport utility vehicle on the market, so if you are looking for a monster, look somewhere else. I bought it because its the best value for the money.

The mileage is not very good in terms of a lot of miles per gallon. But when you buy a sport utility vehicle, fuel economy can not be top on the list.<br><br>
