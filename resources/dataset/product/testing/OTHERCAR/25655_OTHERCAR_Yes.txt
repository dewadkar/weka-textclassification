            My wife and I wanted something a little more practical than our Tacoma 4x4 to haul our 2-year old around in. We wanted to stay under $25k, so we started our search with the Saturn Vue and the Toyota Rav4. The Vue was nice, but there were a number of niggling issues (mainly quality related-see review elsewhere on epinions) that left doubts in my mind and the Rav4 was just too small. After testing the Rav4, the Toyota salesrep mentioned the Highlander but most on the lot were loaded and priced well over $30k, so I didn't give it much thought. A few days later I had my Tacoma in the shop for an oil change and the dealer had a fairly basic Highlander with a 4-cylinder and front wheel drive on the lot. With the doubts about the Vue in my mind, I took the Highlander for a test drive. I was sold instantly. The 4-cylinder has plenty of low-end torque and it feels like the Toyota engineers have spaced the gear ratios perfectly. I did not drive the V6, but we have a Nissan Maxima, so I know what a V6 feels like. If you are considering the Highlander, you owe it to yourself to test drive the 4-cylinder. My gas mileage so far has been around 23 mpg in city driving, much better than the 15 I was getting from my Tacoma!
The Highlander is much bigger inside than anything else in the Mini-ute class (although I don't think the Highlander is considered a mini-ute). I've found the seats to be comfortable, the ride and steering exceptionally stable and solid (far superior to the Vue). The overall fit and finish is standard Toyota. ABS, disk brakes, power mirrors and door locks, and cruise are all standard. Granted, even with all that our model is still a little spartan, but this is a utility vehicle for us, not a badge of conspicuous consumption. I would have to agree that a $35k loaded Highlander might not stack up well against other competition in that price range, but if you can live without a burled mahogany dashboard and heated seats and are unimpressed with the Mini-ute competition, hunt around and see if you can find a base-model Highlander. FYI-don't expect to get much off the sticker!
