            Okay People,
As anybody who reads my reviews knows, I research and research and research my purchases until I am certain I have the best for the buck! This car is a dream come true! It rides so smooth, the interior is very roomy and the back seats fold down for extra big products. You can even have a baby car seat in the back (you know what a pain it is to take those out) and still fold down part of the seat. Last week I put 2 play structures in the trunk and still had room for my stroller! I won't even get into all the extras that come with the car. I mean like automatic seats, duel temp control, great stereos and awesome colors they come in. I feel like I'm driving a sports car but have the ability to haul a truck load. This car feels sturdy and safe. After you drive one you won't be able to buy anything else! I feel like I sound like a commercial, but really, I love my car!<br><br>
