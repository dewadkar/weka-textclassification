            Olympus knows how to make some great cameras.  I bought this camera with high expectations and they were all met.  The resolution is superb.  A full size high resolution picture would probably be about 4 times the size of the screen.  This camera has the usb port which makes file transfers so much faster.  It is small and nicely shaped to fit easy in the hands.  It has around six different resolutions that you can choose from. My favorite option that the camera has would have to be the movie option.  It comes with a infrared remote so you can hook the camera up to a tv and give the fam a nice little slide show.  These are just a few of the great features this camera has.

I only have a few gripes.  You cannot leave the lens cap on when turning camera on.  If you do you will hear a nasty grinding sound and I know that can not be good for the camera.  The menus and icons in the menus are sometimes confusing, but after some time you will get used to them.  

Don't let my gripes discourage you from buying this camera.  I own it and love it.  <br><br>
