            When I bought my Intrepid I test drove a lot of new cars, but once I drove it I knew that was the car I wanted.  In addition to being one of the roomiest cars in it's price/size range it drives beautifully.  My 6' 4' roommate has no problem fitting his knees in the back seat even if the front seat is all the way back.  Then engine and the transmission are exceptionally quiet and smooth, even during extreme acceleration.  Handling is superb both on the highway and driving around the neighborhood.  With the 4 wheel anti-lock disk brakes braking is smooth and confident.
The trunk is, as they say on the commercials, &quot;cavernous&quot;  and will literally fit anything.  It is also a comfort to know that it houses a full size spare tire (even though I have never needed it.)  
I definitely recommend the ES, as the additional feature like the bigger engine, 16&quot; wheels, and transmission are definitely worth the extra money.  Also the split-back rear seat makes loading the large trunk easy, and is almost a necessity when small things slide forward.
The power leather seats are also a very worthwhile upgrade.
Over a year and 20,000 miles the only times my car has been in the shop has been scheduled maintenance.  I do a lot of highway driving, however, and the low, sloping front end seems to invite rock-chips.  If you are buying used check the hood where it meets the front bumper for any signs of damage.  For some reason these cars also seem to get more than their share of door-dings.  Also check the trim and door seals on the outside of the car as they seem to wear poorly.
If you want a roomy car that behaves like a small car, and is a lot of fun to drive, get this car.<br><br>
