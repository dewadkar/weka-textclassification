            I have the Sweet Job of Selling Digital Camera's, and it is part of my job to know how to use em, and sell em.....and this camera usually sell's itself.  The Name Recognition should be enough to convince you it is a quality Product, lots of inovation went into it, and who ever is lucky enough, or smart enough to purchase this camera will be forever delighted.
It will give you Photo realistic quality up to an 11x14 print. It's Compact size and Unique Features like the turret style lens are Original,
facinating, and fun to use.  Instead of getting down low on the ground to capture Kids and small animals...just turn the turret so the LCD is facing you, and you can get great Low Angles, and even shoot over peoples heads at Large gatherings...the turret style lens is to be commended!
USB Connection is another great feature, much faster than recent or previous technology. (Serial Port connection)  High Quality, Ease of Use, and GREAT Manufacturer Support should Convince you.  This Camera is hard to keep in stock, so dont expect the price to go down for almost 6-8 months....Dealers are having no problem collecting $999 for this Gem of a digital Camera.  Carefull when buying off the internet, if they have it in stock, hope you get an undamaged unit with a USA Warranty.  I like to save money as much as anyone, but there is nothing better than being able to drive down the street to the place you bought it in the event of a problem.  To date, we have only seen TWO Defects out of maybe 350 cameras, and Nikon was very receptive as far as making an Exchange was concerned.  If you want the best toys....you can expect to pay for it.
If you can find a COOLPIX 950 still in stock, it also is an excellent camera, and the price has gone down....Grab it while you can if your tight on the budget. (See my Epinion on the Coolpix 950)  I can also consult with you TOLL FREE during the week at 1-800-3CAMERA.
