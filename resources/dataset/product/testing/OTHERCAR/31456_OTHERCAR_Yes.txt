            I'd been eBaying for over a year and I'd been searching for a new PC for almost as long. I already owned a digital camera, but it was far from satisfactory.

That was my situation, when I saw the ad for a decent PC bundle, including digital camera, in the Staples circular. So, to make a long story short, I didn't really pick the Photosmart 318 after weeks of deliberation and smart shopping. It just kind of fell in my lap!

However, I immediately came to love my little camera. I am a terrible photographer and do not blame my Photosmart for my headless shots, or the upside down ones of lamps. It gives me fabulous color, a great flash and an ease of use that is great for a dummy like me! 

At the lowest quality setting, this camera can store over one hundred pictures. If you are planning on using the photos online or just on your PC, the lowest quality is fine. If you plan on printing them out, you will want to go with a higher setting. However, the better the quality, the fewer pictures the camera will hold. (This is just with the regular memory. You can install more flash memory, if you wish.)

The camera has some nice features like a flash (that can be automatic or controlled by you), a zoom (2x magnification), a timer (so that you can take pictures of yourself), automatic focus, a fair sized screen on the back so that you can view (in great detail using the closeup feature) and choose to delete or keep your photos. If you have an HP Photosmart printer, you can also hook your camera up to it directly and print your pictures without a PC.

The camera uses 4 AA batteries and uses a lot of juice! Invest in some Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) rechargeable batteries to get the best value.

It attaches easily to your PC using the included USB cable.

Ok, now the cons... This camera is a little finicky. Sometimes, for no apparent reason, the screen will not show an image unless you take a picture. This is annoying if you were trying to access a menu. However, it is not a crippling defect as most important setting changes do not use the screen menu. Rather, they can be changed by physical buttons located on the top of the camera.

Another slight problem is the fact that the camera cannot focus on an object that is closer than about a foot from the camera. Even when using the zoom, I am obliged to photograph a lot of background just to get a focused picture of a small item. Also, the camera has extreme difficulty focusing on shimmery and gauzy items like sheer scarves.

All in all, this is a great camera for a hobbyist photographer or an eBayer who sells large to medium small items (since it is not perfect for photographing tiny things).
