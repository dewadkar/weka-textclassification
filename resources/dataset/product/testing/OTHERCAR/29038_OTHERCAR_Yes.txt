            Living in the Mid-West you need a vehicle that is reliable, good gas mileage and can handle the snow.  We found in in purchasing our 2000 Honda CRV.   

I use the CRV for all my business trips.  This means I travel through rain, sleet, snow you name it.  The CRV holds the road.  Even in windy conditions I am not struggling to keep it steady.  While driving in a blizzard I felt confident when I felt all four tires gripping the road when I hit an icy patch.

A downfall that I don't like about the design of the CRV is that there is no passenger arm rest.  While this may seem like a small item....I have found my passengers struggling with where they should let their arm rest.  I would recommend purchasing the option immediately.  It is a small price to pay for the added comfort.

Would I buy another Honda CRV......YES!!!<br><br>
