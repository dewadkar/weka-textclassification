            I love the Humvee, my experience though is limited to the military version. Which is a heavier more rugged one, with bulletproof doors and windows. The Humvee is simply the best vehicle on the market if you decide you want to drive over, or through something. Completely water tight you can drive through a river and as long as the air stack is above the water line, you can breathe, it is like a big snorkel.
The humvee is as wide as it is tall, this was designed to prevent the roll overs that was the problem with the Army Jeep.
The Humvee can accept the standard m60 machine gun, a 50 cal machine gun, a 40mm automatic grenade launcher, or a missle launcher. It also has towing capabilities, in case you decide to tow a 135mm cannon behind you. 
You can never have enough things to blow stuff up with. 
Road Rage ? just try to mess with the hummer!
The only two annoying things about the hummvee is the horrid acceleration times it has, and pathetic gas mileage.
Oh yeah- and cost.
almost 70 to 85 thousand for a truck the government pays under 30thousand each for! 
You get a CD player, the government gets missles, who gets the better deal ?
update- 13 people who visited and didn't rate this?
I'm going to have to find me a missle launcher. At least click on something! Don't just leave, if you thought this stunk, rate it so.<br><br>
