            ...that stinks!!  I purchased a 1996 Mirage brand new.  For the first year and a half I was pleased, for the most part.  There were lots of rattles and road noise that bothered me a lot, but it got me where I wanted to go.  However, the word &quot;compact&quot; has a new meaning here!!  Room was something you didn't find much of inside the Mirage!!  The speakers often went out.  The cup holders were directly in front of the CD Player so, if you put something there and hit a bump, the CD Player got a drink.  Speaking of the CD player, it skipped quite easily.  The glove box had a large opening in the back of it and things where lost in there a lot.  I'm not sure if they were in the car somewhere, or if they fell through to the road, but they were gone.  The seats were comfortable for short trips in town.  Traveling was not something that you wanted to do very often in the Mirage and not at all if you were taller than 5'4&quot;.  The back seat laid down to make room for large items in the trunk.  This is a very nice feature, if you plan to leave the car sitting in the driveway.  With the seat folded down you can not move the front seats back far enough to drive or ride unless you are 5'2&quot;.  Which I happen to be but most people aren't.  Also, a note for parents or the expecting, rearward facing CAR SEATS WILL NOT FIT IN THIS CAR.  With the car seat in the middle of the back seat, neither the driver seat nor the front passenger seat will lean back far enough to lock in place.  With the car seat in the side back seat, the front passenger seat will not move back far enough to lock into place.  Also, the car has air bags so children can not ride in the front seat.  Speaking of airbags, I ended up in a wreck in my Mirage.  This was a head on collision at about 40 mph and the airbags did not deploy.  Luckily I did not get hurt that bad, but the car did.  Again, I was hit by a car going about 40 mph and I was going about 5 mph and the car simply crumbled.  If I had been hit at 60 mph I would be dead.  The car did not hold up very well when hit, the airbags did not work and the car was totaled.  The Lord was on my side here, not Mitsubishi safety features. <br><br>
