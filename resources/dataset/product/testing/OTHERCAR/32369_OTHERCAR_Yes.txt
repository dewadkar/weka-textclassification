Strengths: Extremely comfortable, quiet, and secure ride. Excellent creature comfort features, ie: air conditioning, stereo, seat positioning, passenger room, power amenties (windows, door locks, moonroof, rear vent windows, etc.) Commanding view of the road due to vehicle seating positioning and glass area. Outstanding performance from the 300hp/32v/5.4 Intech V8 engine - really moves out for a 5200+lb vehicle. Overall styling is very good.  
Weaknesses: I have to say gas mileage. But, having said that, one doesn't normally buy a Lincoln if they're looking for a vehicle with great gas mileage. Overall vehicle size takes some getting used to, but not a ral problem if you maintain your sense of it.  
Similar Products Used: GMC Tahoe, Surburban, and Jimmy, Ford Expedition &amp; Explorer 
Review Summary: This has to be one of the nicest vehicles I have ever owned. I have been very pleased with the styling, performance, ride, and overall quality in my Navigator. Room for both passengers and cargo is outstanding. Even the 2nd row bench seat feels like a First Class airline seat. While not for everyone, if you're looking for a great ride, with enough room for the wife, kids, and luggage for an out-of-town weekend, I'd recommend you look at a Navigator. If you're budget minded, however, this may not be your best choice. 

I have owned my Navigator for 12 months, having been delivered on 1/30/99. List price was $44847, but it was purchased for $40425, which was $1000 over invoice. I used www.edmunds.com to verify dealer prices, delivery costs, and rebates/incentives available to the dealer. I found the dealer to be very receptive of this knowledge, which made the buying process that much easier.

Mine is a 2WD model, as I have no real use for 4WD. There were not many options available, as most were standard on the Navigator. However, I ordered mine with the JBL stereo AM/FM/Cassette, CD Changer, heated seats, power moon roof, second seat bench, and aluminum wheels. Everything else that I may have wanted was standard: power seats, steering, brakes, windows, door locks, cruise, tilt wheel, leather seats, automatic A/C (temp control), adjustable pedals, limited slip, etc. etc. etc. etc. - the list goes on and on. 

I now have 15800 miles on my Navigator, and have had very few problems. The drivers side overhead map light switch broke which resulted in replacement of the overhead console. Presently, the drivers side heated seat is inoperable, but I haven't had a chance to return it for repair. I suspect a bad switch. But, in 15800 miles, that's it. Everything else has been superb. I would definitely buy another Navigator when the time comes, as I am very pleased with the vehicle. 

I have had the Navigator on the road for at least two long trips (over 1000 miles), and have been very pleased with the ride, comfort, and road presence of the vehicle. Gas mileage on the hiway was 22+, while in the city, I average about 14.5 mpg. Not the best, but I think reasonable for the ride and comfort the vehicle provides. 

I had previously owned 2 Ford Explorers, a '91 which was traded for a '96, which was traded for the Navigator. Prior to that I had an '87 GMC Jimmy. While looking at the Navigator, I compared the GMC Suburban and Tahoe, as well as the Ford Expedition. The GMC products were too 'trucklike' in their ride and both had fairly average fit and finish. The Ford Expedition, on which the Navigator is based, came closest to the Navigator (naturally) in fit and finish and overall ride. However, in '99 the Expedition only came with a 260hp 5.4ltr V8, which while more powerful than the 230hp version in the '98 Expedition/Navigator, it still needed some more legs. Lincoln was developing the 5.4ltr 32v Intech V8 which was rated at 300hp. Indeed, this is the best overall engine but was it was not offered for the Expedition. So, that made up my mind...Navigator was my choice. As soon as the 32v 300hp engine was available, I placed my order. I have been very satisfied. <br><br>
