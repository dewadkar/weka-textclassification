                 I said &quot;little&quot; because thats its stereo type its actually not that small on the inside with only two seats theres plenty of room for you and someone else.  
     I just bought a used '92 &quot;hardtop&quot; miata don't let that scare you because a hardtop is just an option meaning all miatas are convertables the hardtop just fits onto the car after the top is down.  So you get the both of two worlds warmth in the winter and the rush of a convertable in the summer.  Another option I would highly reccomend is the headrest speaker because the give you that surrond sound feel.
     Ok now lets get down to business this car is very fun to drive the five speed transmission is a million times funner to drive than an automatic.  This car has the best handling of any car I have ever drove.  It also has great acceleration.  
     I think almost anyone should get this car except maybe people that hate convertables or fun cars.  So if you decide to buy this car I hope you the best of luck (even though you won't need it its a great car)<br><br>
