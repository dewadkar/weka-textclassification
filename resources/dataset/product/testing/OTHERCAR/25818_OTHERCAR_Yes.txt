            First off I basically love this camera. I had been researching different types of small digital cameras before I settled on this one. The other main camera that I was considering was the Digital Elph. I'm glad now that I didn't purchase that camera because it wouldn't have been portable enough for me. I am currently living in China and purchased this camera for that reason. I want to be able to catch things when they happen. I can just drop this camera in my pocket and go. <p>Some people have complained about the On/Off button being to close to the shutter button. This is true at first but after a day or two of using the camera it ceases to be a problem.<p> Another common complaint is the battery door being flimsy. At first glance it doesn't seem too sturdy but after carrying this camera everywhere with me for a month and a half I had no problems and it doesn't appear that I will in the future.<p> Using a proprietary battery at first seems useless but the camera wouldn't have been able to be as small if it was using AA's. I purchased 2 extra batteries for this camera on eBay for roughly $25 total and have been more than happy with the battery life.<p> The picture quality of this camera is fairly good. Some people complain about blurry pictures or noise. I have experienced no noise in my pictures but occasionally do get a blurry picture if I'm taking a picture of a moving object. I have used this camera for business purposes with all the settings maxed and achieved crisp, crystal clear pictures. The normal pictures I take are very satisfactory for sharing with friends when I just point and click. I can also take a bit more time taking the picture and max my settings and get a very good professional looking shot.<p> Overall, if you want a professional photographer quality camera you aren't looking for something this small. If you are looking for an easy to use, metal cased, high quality, small and lightweight camera then I would recommend this one.<p> I use a 256mb SD card that I purchased on eBay for $65. I normally use 1600x1200 res at the highest quality setting for taking pictures. Currently I have 127 pictures on the camera and 10 video clips with room for about 20 more pictures at this resolution. The video clips range from 50-60 sec on average. I hope this gives you a good estimate of what SD card you will need for your own use. Lowest res for taking pics is 640x480 and the highest is 2304x1728.<p>  Overall I'm quite pleased with this camera. It is well built and feels quite solid. When I showed this camera to my father, who travels extensively and only purchases the best electronics, he said, "Wow, now thats how a portable digital camera should be!".  I hope this helps you with any questions you have when your choosing a digital camera!
