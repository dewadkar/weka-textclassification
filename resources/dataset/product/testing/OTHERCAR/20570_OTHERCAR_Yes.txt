<TEXT>
            As someone who &quot;grew up&quot; in the car business (my dad was an auto sales and leasing professional for nearly 40 years), I've ridden in and driven more than my share of vehicles. My current car -- an Acura 2.3CL -- is far and away my favorite.

I work 40 miles from where I live, so I spend a lot of time in the car. I have never even been tempted to complain about the comfort, stability, power or dependability of my CL. It is a true luxury car -- quiet, smooth and easy-handling. I love that the stereo and cruise control buttons are right on the steering wheel, letting me adjust them without taking my eyes off the road. And living in Wisconsin, I really appreciate the terrific way the CL handles in winter weather conditions. I have never felt safer in a car.

I opted for the 2.3 model rather than the 3.0 because, driving so many miles a year, I was concerned about fuel economy. (You'll never see ME driving a gas-guzzling SUV!) I honestly do not miss the extra power. At better than 150 horses, the 2.3 accelerates nimbly. And once the car's up to cruising speed (for me, around 80 mph), you never miss those two extra cylinders.

The trunk is amply sized, with a ski pass-through in the rear seat. The back seat is comfortable enough on short jaunts (I've been back there for 150 miles in someone else's CL), but probably wouldn't be so great for a taller person (I'm 5'6&quot; tall). But let's face it, most coupes (including the CL) aren't really billed as a passenger vehicles.

Perhaps the most compelling thing I can say about how I feel about this car is that, even though I have it on lease until spring of 2001, I've already talked to my brother-in-law (my &quot;car guy&quot;) about buying the car at the end of the lease. Common sense (and my dad) say, &quot;Don't do it.&quot; But I love the car so much I may not be able to part with it. I'd really miss all those total strangers who approach to tell me what a gorgeous car I have.<br><br>
