            I'd always wanted a Chevy Blazer, so when the transmission on my 95 Grand Am started acting up, I traded it in on a 98 4x4.  Now, I wish I'd just fixed the tranny on the Pontiac.

I do love the design on the Blazer.  It's a good-looking truck, and I love the extra space.  It's just enough for me, and it's easy to get in and out of.

Don't get me wrong, it's never left me stranded.  And I could even forgive the little things, like the levers being gone on the seat adjusters and the lumbar supports not working.  Unfortunately, when I test-drove the car, it had snow tires on it.  Though the dealer bought new tires for me, I had NO IDEA how hard this truck rides!  Not only are you bouncing all over the place with the littlest of bumps, but EVERYTHING in the interior creaks.  ALL the time.  I actually have to keep my window cracked a tiny bit to keep the door from squeaking.  I drive a lot on the highway, and luckily by myself, because there's no way you're having a conversation with anyone with all the road noise.

It's interesting to me to read these reviews and see that we all have the same problems.  I know how it feels when the windshield wipers work only when they want to.  Mine will eventually start working if you turn them on high for a few seconds, but not always.  Or how about the driver's side mirror shaking around like there's an earthquake.  I'm glad that the only problem I have with my rear window is that it squeaks a bit when on rough pavement (knock on wood).

I also have a problem with my airbag light coming on when it's hot outside, and my parking brake has never worked.  My a/c stopped working right after I bought it(leaking seals), but a dumb kid ran a stop sign and hit me so I got the a/c fixed off of that.

And I was SO happy to find out today that even though I spent extra money for 4-wheel drive, it no longer feels as if it has to work.

I don't even want to talk about gas mileage.  I expected it to be low, but not this low.  I can get as low as 13 miles per gallon in the city.  My father gets better gas mileage in his Chevy Silverado WHILE he's pulling his boat and camper everywhere across the state.

I just replaced the serpentine belt, and it's squeaking again.  I'm so tired of Jiffy Lube telling me, "You're Engine light is on, your rear transaxle is leaking, etc, etc."  I bought that truck to be reliable.  I think Chevy owes lots of people an apology.

It's just disheartening to me that this was the first major vehicle purchase I've made, and I don't have any less problems with this one than the ones I've spent much less money on.  I'm still in school, and still have quite a bit of money left to pay on my Blazer when I finish with college.  By then, it may have shook itself apart!

OOOH...and someone try to figure this one out.  The flasher on my Blinker clicks ALL THE TIME!!!  We've taken the flasher off and bought a new one, and it STILL does it.  Good thing my radio still works, otherwise the clicking, creaking, squeaking, and tire noise would drive me insane!  

One of my friends put it best when she said, "I WAS thinking about buying an SUV until I rode in yours."  My boyfriend hates my Blazer and keeps trying to get me to buy a Toyota.  I think I'll consider it.
