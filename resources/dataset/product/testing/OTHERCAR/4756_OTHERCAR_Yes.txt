            Everything feels very tight in this Audi.

The dashboard and controls are very understated, which I like. The dash turns red when driving at night, very pleasant for your eyes.

Comments I get from this car are : "cool", "sexy", which aren't too bad to receive.

The Audi handles very well. Although not a sports car, you feel the road quite nicely.

The 2.8 comes with Tiptronic, which I don't use that much, but it's nice to be able to hold the gears a little longer.

The max hp and torque come in the high rmps, not what you would expect from a V6, but since engine sound is a symphony, just step on the gas!

Drivers seat and front passenger seat are super.
The 2.8 comes with leather, so the front seats are really nice to sit in, for long periods of time.
You can adjust the hardness of the seat for your lower back.

Almost no normal/small-sized sedan has adequate backseat room.
As so, with the Audi. Don't buy this for chaffeuring around your folks.

The back seat folds down, to make room for surf/snowboards. Nice.

After a couple of hours owning this car, I recognized a hissing/whizzing sound from the front vents when the A/C was on. This became quite annoying since the car is otherwise very quiet. 
Audi Service said it was normal. I said no way. I listened to a newer Audi, not the same sound, but you could hear it coming. More people (check out www.audiworld.com) seem to have this problem too.

If you buy used, check for A/C noise! Let the airco run for a little while, turn the fan on the first 1 or 2 settings and listen for a pulsating whizz.

The Bose stereo has too much bass. This might sound ridiculous, but it's true. Even on the min setting on the Bass, it's still to much. Replacements are easy to fit though.

Gas mileage is reported to be 20/29, which I've had too.
