            I drive a 1998 plymouth neon, and I absolutely adore my car.  I drive at least 100 miles a day, 6 days a week, and my car runs almost like new.  This after I have been in two accidents.

I originally bought my neon because I thought it was cute, and at the same time affordable.  I would recommend buying a neon to someone who is looking to buy their first new car.  

They are relatively inexpensive, reliable, and very safe. I have been in two accidents (pretty bad ones i might add), and I walked out of both without a scratch, thank goodness.

I enjoy driving my car...I feel safe, it looks good, and despite a small amount of leg room in the back seat, it's overall pretty roomy.  Trunk space is excellent...I LOVE MY CAR!<br><br>
