            The doors are nice and wide and allow my 8 and 10 year old sons to easily flip up the seats to they can climb into the "way back" as they call the third row of seats. On the EXT body style, the back doors are extra long and make ingress and egress very easy.

Mileage is about 15 mpg in city driving. Whaddaya think? Is that good mileage (for an SUV), or should by eco-buddies string me up by my heels?

The stereo is terrible. I just got the baseline AM/FM/ Cassette/CD Player stereo. Who chooses these things for Chevy? They must be deaf. The stereo sounds like crap. There's no definition in the bass, and absolutely no sense of reality in the quality of the audio. In other words, you're not anywhere close to hearing a cymbal. Instead, you hear a scratchy sound that sort of sounds a bit like a cymbal's second cousin twice removed.

But, that's a minor detail. You can always buy a good stereo and have it installed. There's no option for a CD changer on this base stereo.

I love the ride, although there is some rolling that's noticeable when cornering. The vehicle feels solid and confident (this is my first SUV, and I'm still getting used to sitting up high and looking down into cars). Acceleration is slow and steady from a stop, but, at highway speeds, or even when you're entering a highway from an onramp, acceleration is good. I feel as though I have lots of power in this vehicle (my last vehicle was a Pontiac Grand Prix GT). I just feel, though, that I can actually see the gas gauge sliding down whenever I punch the accelerator.

Interior is okay. The front seats could use more lateral whatever. I just feel like the seat doesn't hold me all that well. I have the power adjustable lumbar stuff and the 37-way power adjustable driver seat, but the seats just don't feel like they were designed to hold people. My kids like the back seats (even the "Way Back" seats). The controls have a nice, solid feel to them, but I hate the standard GM trick of not putting the windshield wiper controls on a separate stalk (GM does it on Saturn); I'd much rather flick the stalk to run my wiper once than twist that knob on the end of the blinker stalk.

Tons of capacity. I got my new vehicle just before I move, and was able to haul huge amounts of stuff (when I had the second and third row seats folded down). And, like I said a while back, the seats fold very easily - I did it in the dark the first night I had the vehicle, and my boys can do it on their own. Clearly, Chevy has designed these seats to make it easy for people who don't have a lot of upper body strength to manipulate them.

One other thing: a standard feature on the EXT version is this funky little voice memo recorder. If you have kids, don't let them know about this feature - they'll drive you nuts with cries of, "Dad, can you make a memo?!" or "Can we make a memo?!"

In short:

The ride is good and steady. Lots of power.
The interior is pretty good, especially the design of the back seats. Controls are nice and easy to use.
Lots of space.
It's not the best looking vehicle on the road (too tall and skinny).
Gas mileage sucks.
The stereo sucks.
