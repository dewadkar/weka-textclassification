            I have had my VW Golf since August, 2000- it's a 4 speed automatic, GL 2 door.  Before I leased the car ($16,0000), I considered the Honda Civic and Ford Focus hatchbacks- I really like hatchbacks because they are small but can still carry a good amount of stuff around in the trunk. 

I settled on the Golf because a friend had a 1998 Golf that never quit, and I also didn't like my Honda Civic test drive (I couldn't parallel park it for my life!) and my family has never had much luck with Fords, so the Focus was out.  Below is my review of what is best and worst about this car-

PROS
1. Superior safety for its size class.  Check out the highway safety commission review of compact cars.  The VW Jetta and Golf (both built on the same platform) came out on top this past year- the Golf has driver's and passenger's side air bags as well as air bags in the doors.  I was informed by the dealer that the Golf is the only car under $25,000 that is offering side air bags.

2. Great handling.  The bad girl in me regrets not getting a standard transmission because this car really sticks to the curves at 35 and 40 mph.  

3. ABS brakes.  So, it's taken a bit of getting used to the brakes, but when you want to stop, you don't have to pump the brakes.  The car stops as smooth as buttahh.

4. Height adjustable seats.  Being puny (5'2&quot;) it's nice to be able to see over the dash.  The Civic didn't have this option.  The seats are also nice and firm- they feel ergonomically comfortable for me, and my friend who is over 6' tall and 220 lbs.

5. Good visibility.  From the driver's seat, you have a good view behind and around you- no blind spots, for me, anyways.  You'd have no problem parallel parking or making quick lane shifts.

6. Great paint job and sound structure.  I backed was in a minor fender bender where the front end of the car behind me crumpled, and I had only a hair width scratch on my rear bumper.

7. Well planned userability design.  Everything in the car is intuitively designed- the back seat folds down *flat*, the front seats can be pulled up for backseat passengers without having to bend over and dig around for a lever (the pullup lever is on the upper part of the seat) and there's no wondering what all the buttons on the dash mean.  I didn't get the CD changer, just the standard tape deck/radio, but the nice thing about the VW CD changer is that it's a plug in appliance.  Literally- you get the changer and plop it into the slot in the trunk.  A nice plus is the blue lighting in the dash- it's distinctive and pretty to look at.  Not at all like the typical green used in most auto interiors.

8. Sweet payment plan and service.  Being a recent college grad, I got a nice discount on my payments, so I'm really paying $14,500 for a car that I bartered down to $16,000.  Also, the dealership I went to bought me bumper-bumper coverage for the next 3 years, which is the majority of my lease (4 years).

9. Good gas mileage.  Of course, car companies are achieving better and better gas economies- but considering the expense of gasoline these days, it's nice to know I can expect to get 25-28 miles per gallon.

10. Surprisingly spacious back seat.  For as compact as the Golf is, I've been able to fit passengers comfortably in the back seat- nobody's complained of cramped feet or legs.


CONS
1. Low pickup on hills.  I know this is typical of most small cars, but living in western PA and dealing with mountainous hills is not what the Golf was intended to handle.  This may have been different if I'd opted for standard transmission instead of automatic.  Also, I don't think of this really much as a CON, than me just being unrealistic.



Overall, as you can see, I love the Golf GL.  It doesn't have the heated seat option like the GLS, which is the only other drawback to my car I can think of.  It handles curves great, has wonderful pickup (except on steep hills) and is a safe little car that fits in those tricky tight parking spots.<br><br>
