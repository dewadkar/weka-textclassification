            Let me start off by saying how much I love my 1990 Corrado G60-- I love driving it, I love the way it looks and handles and I love people asking me what kind of car it is.  While not a commercial success, the Corrado evokes the kind of attention and community often reserved for cars in a different price category. 

But it doesn't necessarily make a great used car.  While still a VW and serviceable at local VW dealerships, the Corrado has too many unique problems that require special attention: the Supercharger (on G60 models), broken sunroofs and leaking passenger-side windows are the source of constant problems-- and finding affordable spare parts is a full-time job. These are very particular cars and need owners with some level of mechanical aptitude.

Used Corrados are likely to be driven very hard by enthusiasts--  modifications and wrecks are common.  If you're lucky to find a pristine stock example, expect to pay a premium.  The US had two models- the 1.8L, 158hp, Supercharged G60 and the Vr6 powered SLC.  If you can afford it, purchase the SLC over the G60-- it seems to have fewer problems.  Prices vary widely from 6K to 16K (on 9/99)and if purchased from a dealer, try to purchase an extended warranty. If this seems high for &quot;a VW&quot;, remember these were not inexpensive cars to start-- expect most models to be delivered loaded with leather, power everything, and trip computer.  And as if to remind you of its more expensive cousin, the rear spoiler rises at 40 MPH.

For anyone thinking about buying a used Corrado, the Corrado-list (via e-mail) and the Corrado-club.com website is a must read-- it's full of great information.   While the 1990-1995 Corrados all look basically the same, certain models, years and options are more desirable than others.  The website and e-mail newsletter (twice a day!) have a very active and friendly following. 

In the last six months, I've noticed a growing trend among the online Corrado community of people saying their good-byes. Whether it's money for school, the new Audi TT or a new baby on the way, many people have also come to realize that their Corrado is no longer a reliable and practical daily driver.  I'm saddened to say that I too am headed in that direction.
