            I'm going to be honest with you all: I do not know much about computers or the equipment that inevitably comes with them. I don't really understand all of the technical stuff, but I can make a well-informed opinion based on my results, because, as they say, &quot;seeing is believing.&quot; My parents first bought this digital camera last summer for their business. Of course, seeing a new toy, I wanted to play with it. The only problem I had was that I did not have the directions. Luckily this was not a problem as SONY made this product so easy to use that instructions were not necessary to perform its most basic functions. 

While I was pleasantly surprised at how easy this digital camera was to use I could not have been more shocked as to its overall quality. Not having a scanner, and hoping to use specific pictures for a possible web page, we decided to simply use the camera to take a picture of our pictures. The quality of these images, pictures of pictures, is great. Except for the flash mark (which can easily be edited out) there was almost no indication that it was taken with a digital camera. While some people may not be surprised by this at all, I was shocked because previous pictures I had seen taken with a digital camera were grainy and it was obvious that they were taken with a digital camera. 

I would definitely recommend this product to anyone considering a digital camera for either their business or personal use.<br><br>
