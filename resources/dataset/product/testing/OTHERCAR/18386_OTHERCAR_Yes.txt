            I always wanted to be a princess when I grew up and now I feel like one. Just bought a 1994 Mercury Villager &amp; I love it. High miles, but full service records, yes every oil change and tire rotation. I have owned over 25 vehicles in my life ranging from a '62 Corvette to a '75 VW and an '88 Dodge Caravan. Some I even purchased new. This is my favorite.

I always have stuff to cart around, an 11 boy with his own head phones, and a big black dog. We now can all travel in comfort.

The ride is superb, handling great and even the turning radius is way better than my old caravan. Probably the only drawback that I can see is that I will never use the roof racks. This would interfere with the sun roof.

I promise to keep it clean, change the oil and maybe in ten years sell it to someone who will love it as much as I do.

I'll keep you posted if I have problems.<br><br>
