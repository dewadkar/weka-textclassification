                 I loved the MX-3 from the minute it debuted in 1992!  My father surprised me for my 16th birthday with a new candy apple red MX-3.  I loved everything about it and drove it until well after I was married, but unfortunately had to sell it in 1998 because my job required a larger auto. I wanted desperately to keep it because it had such wonderful gas mileage, but we needed a down payment for a new car so we sold it.

     I drove this car for 6 years (even back and forth to college 25 miles away for 1 year) and never had any problems mechanically. I never had to carry it to the shop and nothing ever was done except oil changes and typical maintenance.

     I would recommend this car to anyone. The only downfall I can think of is to check safety tests(something I didn't do)because it is a very small car(I was never involved in an accident) and possibly not durable in a crash(my opinion only).  I loved the car it drove exceptionally well for size and looked brand new interior and exterior after 6 years.    <br><br>
