            This is my third Grand AM! Bought the first on in Feb. of 1994, a Grand AM SE, 4 cyl, AT coupe. Not many options. Had to put a alternator in that car after 50K miles, but that is it, I still have the car, and use it as my daily driver. 135K miles and it still looks and drives like new. In Nov. of '99 my wife decided she no longer wanted to drive our Jeep Cherokee anymore, so we sold it and bought another Grand AM. A 2000 GT sedan, white with all option except the sunroof and leather. I loved the car so much I bought another one 6 months later, RED with chrome wheels and a sunroof. Needless to say, I never get to drive that one, my wife claimed that one when I brought it home. I have 16K on the white one, and 3K on the Red one. The only trouble we have had is a power steering pump was leaking on the red one. I dropped it off at the dealer and it was fixed in two days. They gave me a Bonneville SSEi for a loaner while it was being fixed! Haven't had any problems otherwise. 
   It has plenty of power, I had it put on a dyno at a friend's shop, and it puts out 189 HP at the wheels! That's with the drop in K&N filtercharger installed ($40). 50 series Eagle tires keep it glued to the road, even in the rain. Tight suspension and lighting fast speed sensitive steering makes this car handle like no other.
