            I'm writing this in honor of &quot;Baby&quot; (you know, as in, &quot;C'mon, baby, gun it!) who cranked her last mile in the summer of 2000.  My husband and I had gotten her used in 1993 when we suddenly found ourselves in Tallahassee, Florida, the least pedestrian-friendly town in the US.  When we got Baby, she had 30,000 on her; at her last towing, she'd gone over 160,000 miles.  We used that car, and we used her hard, and yet only a couple times did we have any problems with her.  Any car that could survive the paces we put than Sunbird through (including 10+ roundtrips from Florida to Philadelphia, and never EVER an accident or a breakdown either on the long hauls or the short hops) earns a rave review.

Well, all right, Baby had a few downsides.  She wasn't the kindest car as far as gas consumption goes, but nor was she what I could call a guzzler.  Her biggest problem, and I've heard this is true for all Pontiacs, was that she ate alternators, the little device responsible for directing and maintaining the car's electrical systems.  In other words, to be honest, this was a big downside; I don't know offhand how many times we had to get the alternator replaced, but it might have been as often as once a year.  On the upside, Baby had an engine that was an auto mechanic's dream; it was huge and spread out like some great console, with almost everything easy to access.  Ironically, we'd finally moved into our own house where we could work on her ourselves when she went for the last time.

Still, I think there's something to be said for a car that transports you safely for seven straight years.  Baby was the first car we owned, and she gave us our first real taste of American automotive freedom.  If you do manage to get your hands on your own Baby, check to see if she's possibly at 75,000 or lower.  You'll have a good lifespan with her.  You might also ask about the alternator.  But all in all, be good to her, and I suspect she'll be good to you.<br><br>
