            When my husband and I first set out on the search for a mini van I wasn't crazy about the idea.  I was a little intimidated by the idea of driving such a big car. The first time I drove it I KNEW I WAS IN LOVE. Let me tell you a little about it.  
 
-power locks                 
-six CD changer/cassette
-power windows               
-cruise control
-power sunroof               
-radio controls on steering
-leather seats               
-power sliding door
-four captains chairs        
-driver seat is power adjustable

Now if I had to pick one feature I could not do without it would be the power sliding door.  This is every mothers dream.  I like to call it the magic door.  It is located on the passenger side.  It can be used three different ways.  The remote control, the dash button, and behind passenger seat. I can't say enough about it.  Just picture your arms full of groceries while lugging baby and just when you think something is going to fall out of your arms...ahhh the magic door.  The only thing you have to watch out for is the remote is very sensitive, it even works from indoors so without knowing it you could hit it and oops you come to find hours later your door is open, hopefully without any visitors.  TIP: ALWAYS LOCK THE CAR SO YOU WON'T HAVE THAT PROBLEM.

Now as for the car itself, it rides like a dream.  I don'feel like I'm driving a van.  The leather captains chairs are very comfortable, the arm rests are a nice plus.   The ride itself is smooth, even over the bumps.  

The radio controls on the steering wheel are a nice plus especially since the radio is a on the low side.  The stereo system itself sounds good.

The last row of seats has a wonderful feature.  Sometimes you need just a little more room in the back so instead of only being able to remove the seat you can slide it forward. 

The power sunroof is really big which is nice.  My only complaint is closing it from the tilt position.  It is a little confusing because you have to press the same button  to slide it open as you would to close it, but you have to kind of listen for the small pause so that it doesn't continue from closed to sliding open.(sorry my explanation is just as confusing)

The location of the windshield wiper control is strange.  It's very close to the shifter on the steering column so every time you go to shift gears, you end up with a clean windshield wondering why the car is not moving in reverse.

All of these complaints are minor and don't come between me and the love I have for my Sienna
