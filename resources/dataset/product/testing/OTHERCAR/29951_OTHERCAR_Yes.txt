            After my husband and I looked at the Dodge Grand Caravan, we were hooked.  We didn't even go to any other dealerships to check out other minivans.  

Our search for a more family oriented vehicle started with SUVs, but nothing was practical for us being that I need a vehicle that can hold three car seats.  A few of the dealerships swore we could fit three car seats in the back seat of various SUVs.  But no we couldn't, not legally that is.  I think in the back of our minds we knew that a minivan was the only real solution for us.  We only have one child, but I care for two babies full-time, so off we went to the Dodge dealer to check out the minivans.  I really hesitated because there's always been that stigma that goes along with minivans - the whole family car thing.  But honestly when my husband and I saw the Dodge Grand Caravan Sport, we loved it.  It's actually very sharp looking. Once we drove the van, we knew this was the vehicle for us.
Since buying the Caravan, we have used it in so many different ways.  The kids love it, because there is so much room for them and I love it because it's wonderful to drive.  My husband has used it to move furniture, we've taken it on vacation and filled the back completely up, and we only use the van to go grocery shopping anymore.  I think the uses are going to be endless.
Some of the great features of our Dodge Grand Caravan are: the CD/Cassette player, front and back A/C units, grocery hooks (the plastic bags hook on so they don't fall over), moveable seats (so convenient), over ten cup holders, various storage compartments, cruise control, power doors/locks/mirrors, and lots of other great features.  We can't say enough about our Grand Caravan.  We are going to have this vehicle for a long time.  Not only is the ride smooth and comfortable, but the safety factors alone are enough to encourage a purchase.  I feel so much better driving my son and the other children in the minivan rather than our other small four door car.
I would encourage anyone searching for a minivan to test drive the Dodge Grand Caravan, I'm sure they won't find it a waste of their time.
