            I have always loved Saturns.  I don't know why.  It's like I have a soft place in my heart for them.  I've owned each model of the Saturn SL that they have made.  I just went and bought the new 3rd Generation Saturn SL and so far i'm HIGHLY pleased with the car.  It drives and handles like a dream.  It has excellent power, the kind that makes you want to go top speed all of the time.  The car is cute, and while others say that it looks bland, I think it is beautiful.  The lines of the car just roll and make a curvacious plathora of design.  I have only a few complaints.  The car needs more space; Trunk, Front, Rear, ect.  The engine, even through many improvements, is loud.  There is a good amount of road noise, and it's seats are not all that comfortable.  Other than that I would say that Saturn has done a very good job of makeing this car.  All should experience the joy that is Saturn.<br><br>
