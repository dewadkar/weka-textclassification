            There are three models to choose from, the GL with a base price of  $26,290, the GLS with a base price of  $30,425 and the Premiere with a base price of  $33,225. All three come with a 185-hp, 3.4-liter Fuel Induction SFI V6 that is rated at 19 MPG for the city and 26 MPG for the highway mileage. All three come with an automatic transmission, 4-Speed with Overdrive.

One thing I really like as far as a safety factor is the �Restraint System� has dual front air bags with a front side impact air bag for the driver. This is extra protection for the driver with the front side impact air bag, now they need one on the passenger side. Also for safety they have power front disc brakes with a front and rear Anti-Lock system.

Oldsmobile's Silhouette is a sister to the Pontiac's Montana and the Chevy's Venture with some slight design changes.

<b>Standard Equipment on the Premiere model </b>
This beauty is loaded, I am just going to list the main ones.

Air Conditioning, Dual Zone Automatic and an Auxiliary Rear, this system works great even in the rear of the van. 
       
OnStar is included with one-year free service. (This is a nice feature) 

A rear window defroster.

The Entry System is an �Illuminated Keyless Remote Control�

Power: Door Locks, Sliding Passenger Door, Windows, Steering and more. (Be careful when using the power sliding door, make sure no one is in the doors way.)

An AM/FM Stereo with a CD player and Cassette deck with Rear Audio Controls for the ones in the back. (Digital Clock)

Garage Door Opener

Windshield wipers are intermittent for the front with a wiper and washer for the rear window.          
         
All kinds of little storage places and cup holders.
        
The Mirrors are Dual Heated Power & Dual Illuminated Visor Vanity.

The seats have a Dual 8-Way Power with Driver's Memory. (What this means it automatically adjusts the seat depending on which of the two ignition keys are used.) The front seats are also heated.

Tilt steering wheel and cruise control. 

Fog Lights, Cargo Compartment Lights, Daytime Running & Reading Lights
 
 Aluminum Wheels

 A Fuel Tank with a 25-Gallon Capacity.

<b>The Entertainment  Package</b>
This is a mini van with the family in mind.

The Premiere has an Overhead Fold-Down LCD Color Monitor with VCP & Video Game/Camcorder Input Jack. Also are headsets for the ones in the back to use so it doesn�t disturb the driver. (There are 6-cordless headsets)

The Monitor is mounted from the roof and not on the floor. This makes it nice for watching the screen. The picture quality is great! 

This will keep the kids entertained on those long trips.

<b>The Ride</b>
The ride is smooth and cornering was a surprise for me it cornered rather well. 

The engine was rather quiet and I got from 0 to 55 MPH in about 9 seconds. If you need to pass someone it had enough get up and go to do it.

Visibility all around you wasn�t bad, this also surprised me. Road noise wasn�t bad and it seems to shut other outside noise out pretty well.

The cruise worked great, when climbing a hill it never lost more than 1 MPH. The brakes held really good and I couldn�t get the to squall when I locked them up, the anti-locks worked great. 

<b>Overall</b>
The price on this Premiere was $34210 with a $640 destination charge included. This is a little steep but remember it has all the extras including the entertainment system for the rear passengers. If this price is to steep remember, you could get the basic GL model for about $7000 less.

It is attractive minis van with plenty of room and storage. This makes it a great addition if you have to haul the kids around to their different ball games.  

I highly recommend the Oldsmobile Silhouette Premiere.
