            When we finally decided it was better to have a van that actually spent the majority of its time on the road rather than in for service, we began looking to trade in our 1995 Ford Windstar.  As the mom of 5 kids, 7 and under, a van was not simply a nice thing to have, it was a necessity.  We test drove many different models and even gave our old nemesis, the Windstar a fresh look with its new body style.  But in the end, it was the Grand Caravan SE that won out.  

Trying to pick ONE favorite thing about the Grand Caravan is a difficult thing to do.  But if forced, I'd have to say that I can't imagine life before my driver's side rear door.  It makes getting kiddos in and out of carseats a cinch.  And no more mass dashes to the one passenger door where a fight or pile up is sure to ensue.  There are many other things to love about this model though.  It handles like a dream.  You almost forget you're in a van, especially when it comes to u-turns and making those hairpin turns.  The steering ratio is unbelievable!  The seats are nice and roomy with lots of space for growing bodies to squeeze into.  The driver's seat is nice and comfy for the long haul and the easy to reach controls, make for a worry-free cross country jaunt.  Another great thing for those long vacation trips is the onboard computer system that tells you everything from your current gas mileage to the outdoor temp.  And there's plenty of cargo room to carry the baby's stroller and tons of luggage.  

We plan to keep this baby for years to come so who knows what will be on the market when the day finally comes for us to make a trade.  But I'm pretty sure the Dodge Grand Caravan SE in the year 2008 or so will definitely get a look when the time comes.<br><br>
