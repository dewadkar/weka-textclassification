            Was just a rental for a few days. Didn't had the chance to try out the rear parking aid, but at the dealer I tried out the rear seat folds flat into floor, and gives you a huge storage space.

What's really good about this minivan MORE then any others is: Fuel Economy, Biggest fuel tank in class at 25 Gallon (only Ford Windstar has a 26 Gallon, but Ford's van is very thirsty and drinks up the gas very quickly causing it to burp afterwards.... Know Ford's is a REALLY noisy engine) Rear Parking Aid is also available on GM's and Ford's.

GM's minivans also has the biggest outside mirrors in class, giving you a clear look around. The Venture & Pontiac Montana are the only ones to offer available 8 Passenger seating, while Chevy add to that one built in child seats (in the lower end Chrysler/Dodge MV's you could have 2 child seats). Another advantage of the GM minivans is that the center windows flips out, a feature no other MV offer today. Some old Chrysler MV used to offer it, but things are getting worse not better these days... tooo bad...

The Con's? The smallest, weakest engine, but at least gives you great mileage, although the Honda Odyssey (which I don't like the different shape, but the van is great) has the strongest engine today (240 hp in 2002 models) and delivers also outstanding mileage, almost as the Chevy Venture.

Another funny thing is the wipers. The good part about the wipers that it flushes in when not engaged, so you see no wipers, and reduces wind noise (as Chevy is advertising), but when activated, the upper wiper stays a little up, giving you a blind spot, and looks funny! Also it doesn't cover enough of the windshield. Gotta be a little bigger.

Chevy Venture is the only minivan not offering Fog Lamps. Also the only minivan not providing RPM gauge, called tachometer, even for a 1000 bucks. It's simple not available. Also GM's minivans doesn't offer electhrochromic mirrors, which most other minivans DO offer it, at least optional!

The GM's minivans also have an outdated message center, with old looking tired gray fonts on a thirsty looking orange LCD.

The only different I found in the Montana is, they offer a tachometer, fog lights, red gauges as all Pontiac's, 2-tone paint gives it a beautiful look. The Chevy Venture is also the ONLY minivan that doesn't offer color-keyed color handles and bodyside molding, only in the WB edition. Chevy may also choose new wheels. How many more years they think to stay with those old outdated wheels which wasn't changed since 1997?

Still doesn't give you Automatic Temperature Control as Chrysler/Dodge/Toyota MV's. and the rear A/C is really funny there - the center row passengers gets the air from the rear... There is no separate A/C ducts for all passengers as Ford/Toyota/Chrysler/Honda, only one vertical bar serving all passengers. The front cup holders are "one size fits (?) all". while other MV's offers cup holders which adjust to your cup size.

So for an average driver, it should be good. Better than most other minivans.
