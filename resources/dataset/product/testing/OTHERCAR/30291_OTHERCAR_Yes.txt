            Well first off I bought the Saturn SW2 to replace my old Honda Civic about 10 months ago. My parents used to own a '95 Saturn SW2 and I really like how it drove and also the versatility of the car. I do a lot out door activates and so I find the rear trunk very useful for transporting coolers, snowboard, and also my mountain bike.

I recently went up to Lake Tahoe to go snowboarding and I bought special chains for the Saturn called Spiders. They work really well and I had no trouble getting around in the snow, which made for a great day of snowboarding.

Another great quality of the SW2 is the gas mileage. I so a lot of freeway driving because I go to visit my girlfriend every weekend in San Diego, which is about a 300 mile trip. On the freeway I have gotten about 37-39 miles to the gallon and when I'm driving around town I get about 25-29 miles to the gallon.

One of the features I really liked about the SW2 and all other Saturns is the dent resistant paneling. This really helped to protect the car when I went to grocery stores since my cars are always a magnet for shopping carts. Also it�s always fun to give your car a little whack once in a while to impress your friends. J

The seats in the back can fit two people comfortably and the driver and passenger seats are very comfortable as well which make long drives relatively more enjoyable.

Over all I would recommend the Saturn SW2 to anyone who does a lot of traveling and out door activates. With the great gas mileage, dent resistant paneling, and abundant space in the back anyone will enjoy driving the SW2. Oh and don�t forget the Saturns are American Made!!!
