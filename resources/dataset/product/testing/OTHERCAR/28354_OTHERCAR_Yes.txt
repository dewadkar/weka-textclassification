            I looked at the Acura RL, the Audi A6, the BMW 530i, the Cadillac STS, and the Lincoln LSE when looking for a car that was both comfortable and performed well.  I wanted a car that would be fun to drive when I wanted some excitement, but also comfortable to drive the rest of the time.

The Lincoln was more comfortable and better appointed than most of the other cars.  The ride was better than all others, with the exception of the Cadillac.  Handling was better than the Cadillac, as good as the Acura, and almost as good as the BMW and Audi (which has all wheel drive).

I like the look of the vehicle (especially with the LSE trim level), and the overall build quality is good.  The only surprising thing was three small defects that I feel should have been caught before the car left the factory.  There was a small grinder mark in the edge of the hood, a few small dots of welding spatter on the drivers door under the handle, and one of the pieces of body side molding does not align perfectly with the other pieces.  Nothing major, but probably all things that would have been caught by a German or Japanese luxury auto maker.

I have not owned the car long but am very happy with it so far.  I have driven several of these cars as rental cars over the past 2 years and have never had a bad experience.  

I would recommend this car to anyone who wants a comfortable ride, good performance, but does not need the fastest sports sedan around.  While it is quick, it is still middle of the pack for a sports sedan.
