            I've had this car over 18 months and it hasn't had a single problem.  Oh, one little problem, the latch on the console between the driver's seat &amp; front passenger doesn't &quot;click&quot; anymore.  Big deal.

It handles great, I live on a hilly street with a very hilly driveway.  I got up the driveway all winter into my garage!  (other cars used to be parked by the street during this weather!)

My only real complaint is that the mileage isn't as good as my former car (Toyota Corolla).  However, compared to those guzzling SUV's out there, the mileage is good.  I average 21-25 mph, depending on speed, traffic, etc.  But considering I have disk brakes, and 4wd which have prevented at least two accidents already, I am not complaining at all.  

The car is solid, comfortable, and easy to drive.  Passengers in the back don't feel cramped, a 6'2&quot; guy often rides in the back and he is perfectly fine.  

Storage is great in this car, I can fit my bike INSIDE the wagon, along with luggage for a long weekend trip.  In fact, we brought the car to the Cape two weeks ago with my bike, a ton of the wife's luggage and came back with a bunch of souvenirs!  

I have not had a single mechanical problem.  I change oil religiously and had transmission fluid recently changed.  There is nearly 24,000 miles on it now so I will need some manufacturer work done on it.<br><br>
