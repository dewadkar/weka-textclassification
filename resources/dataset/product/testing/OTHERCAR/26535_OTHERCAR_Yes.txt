            My husband just had to have a 4 by 4 truck.  So we went looking.  Since we didn't want to spend a small fortune, we settled for the smaller truck. The Chevy S-10 fit the bill. My husband works for General Motors, so our choices were limited,but the rebates were great.  The current year models were on sale and VERY hard to come by. We almost gave up.  

Then, we found a truck with a v-6 engine and 4 wheel drive. Just what my husband ordered.  We didn't care too much about other options, but we should have. The truck came with a bench seat. Not the split bench, mind you, just a plain old bench. This didn't seem like a problem. I wouldn't have realized it on a test drive either. It wasn't until we took a 900 mile trip did I find out what was wrong with the truck. The only adjustment you can make with the seating is how close you are to the steering wheel.  I am only 5 foot and 2 inches tall.  When I drove, the seat was too close for my husband, even though he is only 5 foot 8 inches.  His knees were in his chest!  When he drove, I had plenty of leg room, but the seat itself was too wide for me. My feet did not rest comfortably on the floor board. This caused low back pain.

I like the truck, but can't wait to trade it in on one with either a split bench seat, or bucket seats.
