                 My wife and I recently purchased a 2000 Kia Sportage EX 4-door and are thrilled with this purchase.  I think the greatest thing that can be said about a vehicle is that you would purchase the vehicle again, and we certainly would. 
      We were in the market for a sport utility vehicle when we found out how difficult it was for us to get our infant son in and out of his car seat.  The lease on my 98 Honda Accord was also up.  Being loyal Honda owners we set out to look at the Honda CR-V.  Our dealer only had one on the lot and was unwilling to budge from sticker price, and that coupled with the terrible experience we had getting basic warranty work done from our dealer, sent us elsewhere.
      We then drove the Suzuki Grand Vitara JLX.  It had a very cheap feeling interior and the V-6 engine was so unresponsive in the mid range that it felt like it would never get up to speed.  The dealer was willing to work on the price with us but it did not include a CD player, and that was a must for us.
      We continued our search at the Kia dealer and fell in love with this vehicle immediately.  It was completely loaded except for the rear spoiler, ABS, and leather interior.  The dealer was very willing to work with us and got us everything we asked for including the 4.9% financing from Primus.  We now have almost 3500 miles on the vehicle and have had no problems whatsoever.  I recently took the vehicle on a 500 mile business trip and was thrilled with it's creature comforts, great stereo, and highway feel and handling.  This is the first winter we have ever been anticipating the first big snow fall, so we can really give that 4-wheel drive a workout.  If you are considering a Small SUV purchase in the near future I Highly Recommend the 2000 Kia Sportage EX 4-wheel drive.
