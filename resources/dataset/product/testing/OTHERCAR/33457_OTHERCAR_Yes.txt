            Ever come across something that we wish you had a camera with you?
My wife and I do all the time. We usually have at least one disposable camera with us when we travel and keep one in the car. Then comes the problem of waiting until we finish up the roll. But the excitement of finally getting the roll developed just to see what we had shot. This usually results in, &#147When did we take that?&#148 &#147What is that?&#148 

When it was time to leap into digital, I had certain needs. 
*Price: If we damage or loose the camera, it won&#146t be a financial hardship.
*Size: Disposables fit in your pocket. I don&#146t want to lug around extra baggage.
*Batteries: Proprietary batteries= expensive and sometimes hard to find. Rechargeable batteries are ok. But when they are dead and you can&#146t charge them= extra baggage and dead camera. 
*Features: What features did we need? Optical zoom (won&#146t degrade photo like digital zooms), Panoramic (another feature of a disposable), Flash (for some of those dark shots), expandable memory (More pictures on one card= less baggage).

Now this is not meant to be a digital camera buying guide, only a guide to what our needs were and why we choose the Olympus D-520.

The Olympus D-520
*Uses 2-AA batteries (we use rechargeable batteries, we got free after rebate).
     They seem to last around 100 pictures with display on.
*Uses up to a 128mb (wish it could use bigger cards such as 256mb & 512mb)
     It has four resolution modes. 
	SHQ (Highest quality) 128mb = + 96 photos
	HQ (next down) 128mb= + 296 photos
	SQ1 128mb= + 600 photos
	SQ2 (email quality) 128mb= + 900 photos
We have been using HQ mode for most of our photos. They print out nice 5x7 prints on our inkjet printer. I also email them (though they eat up 435mb, which may take a while to up/download, if you are using a dialup).
*The Flash pops up when you open lens cover, which also turns on the camera. You can go into a dark, pitch black room, and when you snap a picture, it comes out as if all the lights were on. The pictures we have taken this way have not been washed out from the flash. In fact they seem to have just the right amount of light. Now keep in mind this flash is probably not good for distances over 15 feet away.

Now the problems we have encountered so far:
	*If object is moving (faster then a slow walk), and you are zoomed in, the picture will blur.
	*If it is really sunny and don&#146t have white balance set right (Even in automatic), the pictures will blur.
	*Recovery time. The time between taking a picture and the camera being ready to take another picture, can be as little 1second to as long as 2.5 seconds. This may not seem like along time, unless action is happening in front of you.

Plusses to the problems:
	*You can set the camera to show you the picture instantly, after it was taken, so you can retake if bad. 
	*There is a movie mode to take moving shots. But it eats up memory and quality is not true video quality.

Note: It seems Olympus has gone to proprietary batteries like most of there competitors, at least with the newer cameras. This might be because accessories are where companies make money. Either way the option of AA or AAA batteries may be harder and harder to find in the future.
