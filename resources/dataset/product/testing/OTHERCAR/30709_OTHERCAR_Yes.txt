            My wife and I purchased a Pontiac for her shortly after we were married. She drove it every day for 13 years with no problems what so ever. At that point we felt fairly confident buying one for our son Brian after his first car had been totaled in an accident.

We bought him a used �94 Sunfire from a local dealer and the car has been nothing but problems from the first day we got it. Three days after we bought it the car refused to start. We stopped the check and called the dealer. The dealer towed it to a service station and charged us $250 to fix a broken fan belt. Five hours after we picked the car up the second time it refused to start. We called our car club and they had it towed and inspected by a third party. The engine block needs to be replaced which will cost about $1300. We once again stopped the check and will probably end up having to fight the dealer in court.

For the short time we were actually able to drive the car it handled well. I wish I was able to give you a more detailed review but alas, the car no longer runs.

I don�t know if it was this particular car or if it�s the model. It just goes to show you that you have to have any used car you want to purchase inspected thoroughly.
