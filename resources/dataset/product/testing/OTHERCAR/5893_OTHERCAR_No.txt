            It was time to retire my beloved 2500 Gmc diesel after 10 years of hard work and I really liked the looks of the new style Dodge. The dealer was helpful and was very willing to fix us up with the right truck.  We went looking and found the Quad Cab to fit the bill of what fit our needs. This truck has the 5.2L or 318 with an automatic. It is rated for 13-18 mpg and was confirmed that was not a problem to obtain. That was what made the decision over the 360. When we picked the truck up we were totally happy with the ride and the amount of room. The rear doors are super and the rear seat comes in very handy. The truck is two tone and the colors are good and it makes a sharp package. It has power everything and the heated mirrors are handy on those frosty mornings. We travel North Snowmobiling hauling a trailer and there is no problem with taking the 9 hour ride in this truck.
 There has been a lack of quality after only 15000 miles and the gas goes through it like there is no tomorrow. Empty highway 13 mpg if you're lucky, 10 mpg towing a 1500# trailer. The power up hill lacks and the dealer has adjusted it a few times to no avail. The shifter had a pin snap and unless you were in neutral you could not start the truck. Now with cold weather the windows freeze shut all the time which is something I have not had with either my GMC's or Fords. It already has lots of surface rust showing and the dealer says it was a poor plating job. The over head console keeps loosing up and needs attention often. The carpet has a rubber back and condensation has build up under it and it has no way of drying and the truck has a musty smell.
This is by far the most comfortable truck to ride in that I have owned (8 New trucks) and it has also been the most disappointing. Usually  I put on 40k plus a year and this one only has 15,400 after 16 months. When you spend that much on a vehicle you want it to last.<br><br>
