            The 2003 Toyota 4Runner is a fantastic car.  From the new Body shape, it's new handling features and hidden compartments.  It's has all the bang for the buck.  I love how the 4Runner rides.... its, very smooth, like a luxury car.  The 4Runner seems to be larger in size than the older models, which is a great feature.  It also has a new hard cover 'shelf' for the hatch of the SUV.  Therefore, if you perhaps have a stroller or something you always carry around, you can put it under the shelf and have perhaps your groceries on top of it.  My problem before having a Pathfinder, i would have my stroller in the car at all times, but when i would go grocery shopping i would have to stack all the groceries on my stroller, with the new 4runner, you can put the 'shelf' in and have to levels of the trunk.  The 03 4Runner also has many additional features, such as a pull out in the back seats that hold your fast food bags, convertible sized cup holders, and a tray that pulls out so you can place your food on it... instead of balancing it in your car.  The adjustable cup sizes are great, from holding a super big gulp to the smallest cups... no more spilled drinks.  The interior is very roomy and spacious.  It's quite luxurious and the SUV makes you feel as if you are in a luxury car.  It's like driving a Mercedes.  It's fantastic.  The Toyota 4Runner also has a sport edition vehicle that has a V6 engine and has a sporty new look.  It's great for anyone looking for a sharp looking SUV without the extra bulk and weight.  The stock tires and hubs also look great with the vehicle.  There's not much I can say that I don't like about the vehicle.  I wish the price of the SUV was a little lower, but I think you get what u pay for.  And Toyota has done tremendous to revamp this beautiful SUV.  It's a modern looking vehicle, and is great for both the young and young at heart.  It's a fantastic vehicle that looks great in any color you get it in.  Gas mileage on the truck is about the standard for any SUV out on the market....  Best SUV on the current market.  Where else can you find a SUV that drives as well as the 2003 TOYOTA 4RUNNER.
