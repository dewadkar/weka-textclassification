            Second Opinion:&quot;Olympus D-360L&quot;
&quot;Wow, what a camera! Took this camera to our daughters wedding in September. Took over 100 pictures. Down loaded to my laptop, edited the ones we wanted to keep. Sent the rest to our online photo processor, had them put on a disk and had several made into hard copies. Several photos we sent to friends and relatives on the internet in e-mails. 
What a great way to process and store photos.
The pictures are great, looks like a professional photographer took them.
&quot;I will not leave home without may D-360L.&quot; The easy operation, great pictures, the low cost on processing, storing and a disk where I can view and have more hard copies made. &quot;What more can I say?&quot;
I highly recommend this camera. Olympus is going to have to work hard to come up with something better, and if they do, I'm sure it won't be in the same price range.
Think about this camera for the holiday,coming in a few weeks, as a nice gift for yourself or a family member.
