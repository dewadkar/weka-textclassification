            When I first started to drive I didn't know what i wanted to drive until I got behind my dad's Toyota Camry. Not only does this incredible car run smoothly but packs in the horses. It's incredible accelaration helps you get to your destination quickly. It's affordable price allows for the range of people buying go from low middle class to the extremely wealthy. It includes all of the luxuries needed. It has the required heat and air conditioning that are a must along with power windows and locks which allow for easy access and air. It has the standard radio and cassette with the option of getting the cd player which these days is a must. The steering is another plus with it's easy turning and when it comes time to brake it includes anti lock brakes. 
I suggest that anyone who is looking for a new car look no farther than a Camry whether old or new. It's reliability surpasses all in its class and its price is affordable for all. It is a easy car for people to drive and for those learning how to drive it is great because it won't jack up insurance rates because of its family like quality which tends to lower insurance.<br><br>
