            The HP 315 was my first venture into digital photography a year or so ago, and from the beginning I loved it.  However, I didn't realize just how good it was optically until I compared it to the much more expensive Olympus Camedia 3020 Zoom. It's worth comparing these two cameras because the optical failings of the Olympus highlight what a great bargain the HP 315 is.

The HP 315 is a mid-range, no frills point-and-shoot, with a 2.1 Megapixel resolution.  It's basic in that it is entirely automatic, doesn't allow you to mess with aperture or shutter speed, and certainly doesn't have any of the advanced settings offered by the Olympus 3020 Zoom (such as black and white, white balance control etc etc).  However, it's a dream to use all the way through the process (from actually taking photos to downloading and viewing the images).  What's more, it takes wonderful pictures at three resolution settings.  The lowest resolution is adequate for most snapshot needs; the second level is excellent (giving clear, full-screen images on a PC).  I rarely use the third, though it's clear that any pictures taken on this highest setting could be blown up to large size without loss of resolution.

More praise for the HP: it's CONVENIENT in every respect.  Resolution changing is one-touch, and the menu system is simple and logical.  Furthermore, downloading couldn't be easier: you connect to your PC with the USB cable provided, open the camera and the software automatically recognizes the camera and prompts you for download.  Before you do this, you can view the images and rotate them if necessary (unless you're using Windows 95), then select a folder to download them into - the software remembers where you sent the last batch and offers you that as a default - and off you go.  It also gives you the option to automatically delete the photos from the camera after they've been downloaded.  Finally, the photo viewing software that comes with the HP 315 is ACDSee, which is outstanding and very easy to use.  All this for $250, a year ago; it's much cheaper now.

But the Olympus Camedia C-3020 Zoom is almost twice as expensive (I paid $445, plus another $25 for a 32 Meg storage card).  It's 3.2 MP and in many other ways is much fancier, so it must be much better, right?  Wrong.  Yes, it has many more features than the HP, but then it's supposed to be more like an SLR than the humble little HP point-and-shoot.  Most of the problems I list below are, admittedly, simply convenience-related, although this drawback in itself is enough to suggest that you seek another piece of equipment if you want something more flexible than the HP.

However, I was astonished to find in a side-by-side test with the HP 315 that the C-3020 actually takes WORSE photos, and does so with larger file sizes.  I snapped a series of photos with each camera, at the same time, from exactly the same locations and in exactly the same conditions; with flash and without.  These included inside and outside photos, as well as an experiment in which I took pictures of books in a bookcase (the print is a good test of a lens' optical quality). 

I tested the lowest resolution on each camera, and also compared the HP's second resolution level with the Olympus' second (HQ, high quality) setting.  The resolution on the Olympus was in all cases inferior, and it dealt consistently poorly with many exposures in its fully automatic mode (both inside and outside photos frequently came out darker or less even than on the HP).  Yes, you can of course compensate for this on the Olympus by utilizing the camera's option for manual control, but this is cumbersome to do every time and would certainly be a trial and error process.  When you're trying to get easy photos without much fiddling around in a standard, non-creative situation, you'd like the automatic mode to be able to do this with no fuss.  It doesn't.

Then I compared the HP - still at its second-level resolution - with the 3020's THIRD level (SHQ); note that the latter generates file sizes that are between one and two million bytes.  Amazingly, the point-and-shoot STILL performed better, with markedly superior resolution (and at file sizes less than a quarter of those generated by the Olympus).

Given the poor image quality, it may be pointless to list other problems with the Olympus, but here they are anyway.  The optical zoom (3x) on the Olympus is of course much superior to the max 2.5 digital zoom on the HP; the latter provides lousy resolution at its maximum setting and is essentially unusable as a result.  But the Olympus zoom has the annoying feature that - on any setting except the most wide-angle (the camera default) - the viewfinder image is shifted from the image that the camera actually captures.  This means that, in any mode except wide angle, you have to compose a photo using the LCD screen, which is a very fast way to drain batteries.

The menus on the Olympus are complicated, though you get used to them with practice.  However, there is no one-touch feature for resolution control, so if you want to switch from snapshot to HQ (or better) mode this involves a several-step process (again, with the HP 315 you can do this with a single button).  The highest quality setting on the Olympus gives you a TIFF file, which is all very well, but it's so enormous (millions of bytes) that storage and manipulation become a major issue.  And again, the second and third resolution levels (HQ and SHQ) are inferior to the HQ setting of the HP 315, yet the file sizes it produces are larger.

The software (Camedia) that comes with the 3020 is miserable in comparison to HP's.  Unlike the HP, the Olympus software doesn't automatically recognize the camera and prompt for downloading; in fact I couldn't get the Camedia program to download at all -it kept telling me it couldn't connect to the camera -  and I had instead to transfer files using Windows Explorer.  There is no option to preview and rotate images prior to download, and no option to automatically delete images from the camera's memory card afterwards (again, all standard with the HP).  Not only that, but a really annoying feature of this camera is that, once you've downloaded and deleted a batch of images, it starts the next batch with the same file numbers.  This means that you can't download consecutive batches of images into the same directory without manually renumbering every one in the second set.  This is a very basic and extremely aggravating deficiency.  In contrast, the HP 315 keeps track of numbering and starts file names for any new images with the next number in the sequence.  Simple and logical, right?  Why on earth Olympus couldn't figure this one out is beyond me.

Once you have the images on your PC, the Camedia software's display mode is vastly inferior to that of ACDSee.  It doesn't allow one to easily move through photos (this can be done very easily in ACDSee with the mouse wheel) or to show full-screen images (again, a simple touch of the mouse wheel with ACDSee).

So all in all, I have serious buyer's remorse with the Olympus, and appreciate my little HP 315 even more than before.  This is all the more disappointing given that I have liked Olympus products in the past; I have two 20 year-old OM1 SLRs that still work well and take great photos, and also have a nice little Olympus point-and-shoot 35 mm.  I was prepared to suffer the inconveniences in the 3020's design on the assumption that I'd be getting better quality photos (or at least images that were comparable to those of my little old HP).  But I can't even approach this without going to image quality settings that produce huge files - and even then the optical quality of the lens remains visibly inferior to that of the cheaper Hewlett Packard.  So essentially I paid a lot more  for manual controls, and even though I will often have to mess around with these to compensate for the camera's deficiencies in automatic mode, I'll still get lousy results.

In summary, the Olympus Camedia 3020 zoom is a camera to avoid; I don't know how people who rave about this camera justify the praise, but perhaps they haven't had the advantage of testing it against anything else.  If you really don't need shutter speed control and other creative features, and instead want just a good quality digital that will be easy to use and give great results, go with the HP 315.  It's a super little camera, and a real bargain.
