            Unfortunately, the Oldsmobile Alero wasn&#146t very successful in competing with the Honda Accord, Toyota Solara, or the Dodge Stratus - All vehicles in its price class. While not as popular, The Alero certainly stands up to its competition. Boasting a 150-horsepower, 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine, this car operates much like a V6. Unfortunately, the Oldsmobile brand is being phased out by General Motors in a year or so.


<b>What I like about this vehicle:

It has power everything!</b> This can be as much as a liability as an asset, but right now I am enjoying the positive aspects of this: Keyless entry, driver&#146s 6 point power seat, remote trunk release, power mirrors, doors and windows. There is also a panic alarm on the keypad, to alert passersby if you are in trouble. When activated, an alarm sounds, replete with flashing headlights and the whole shebang.

<b>The controls are very well placed and easy to read</b>, odometer, speedometer, etc. The buttons for cruise control are conveniently located on the steering wheel, which is wrapped in matching leather. There is an auxiliary outlet into which you can plug your cell phone or other electronic gadgets, freeing up the cigarette lighter outlet for the use of smokers.

<b>The trunk is roomy</b> &#150 larger than even the Honda Accord&#146s trunk, and the rear seats fold down if necessary to accommodate oversized items you may need to transport. 

<b>The sound system, while far from a Bose, is actually much better than the usual factory installed system.</b> The Alero comes standard with AM/FM radio and single compact disc player. It comes preset, with settings for <i>jazz, classical, country, pop, and a manual setting</i> which allows you to adjust the bass, treble, and mid-range sounds. There is even a setting for talk radio! The only problem I have is the CD player skips if you are driving over rough road. Either the CD player is too sensitive, or the suspension could use a little beefing up.

In my last vehicle, a Subaru Impreza, I could barely drive 20 miles before I started to get an ache in my lower back. The seats on the Alero are well padded to accommodate longer than average drives, and they match and complement the exterior color on all the color schemes I have seen. My car is gold, with interior cloth seats that are shades of tan and brown. And while I have the 4-cylinder coupe automatic, the Alero comes in a sedan, with 5-speed manual transmission, and a V-6 engine also. There are several combinations to choose from.

<b>Steering is so easy it&#146s almost frightening!</b> - You merely have to move the wheel slightly for this car to respond. It handles unbelievably on sharp turns, much like a sports car. It took me a while to get used to the sensitivity of the mechanism and to stop over steering. And the pick up on this car is remarkable. I found myself climb smoothly from 0 - 70 in under 30 seconds!

<b>The head/fog/parking lights</b> There is an automatic setting, which allows the vehicles computer to adjust the lights according to the time of day, or lighting in the area in which you are driving &#150 Just set it and forget it!

All in all, I am happy with not only how this car handles, but how it looks. The back sits up high and the front low to the ground, much like a dart. The wide aluminum alloy wheels give the coupe the appearance of a more expensive sportscar. The spoiler kit on the back only adds to the sporty effect.

<b>What I don't like about the Alero:</b>

<b>Headroom is virtually non-existent.</b> I am 5'9", which is hardly tall &#150 Still my head sometimes hits the roof of the interior &#150 I can&#146t imagine anyone taller than 6ft. tall being comfortable for an extended period of time.

<b>There are 2-cup holders in the front</b> &#150 One between the driver and passenger, and one right in front of the gearshift. The one in front of the gearshift cannot be used comfortably when the car is shifted into certain gears, as trying to get to the cup or container is impossible. The cup holders in the back (2) pull out from the centerpiece and are well placed.

<b>The narrowness of the side and back windows, and the aerodynamic slant of the car make it difficult to see well when backing up.</b> It takes some getting used to, especially when it&#146s raining. I had to use my rearview and side mirrors constantly until I got the hang of it.


<b>Safety features:</b>
Both coupe and sedan come with four-wheel disc brakes with ABS, traction control, a four-wheel independent suspension, and hydraulic engine mounts. They come with anti-lock brakes and electronic traction control. (Which is designed to reduce wheel spin under hard acceleration.) 

According to Oldsmobile, <i>&#147The traction control system uses ABS wheel-speed sensors that detect when the front wheels are spinning; torque is then reduced by up shifting the transmission, retarding ignition timing and, if necessary, cutting fuel to the injectors.&#148</i> After being activated, this system can be turned off by just a push of a button. The ETS button is located just below the gearshift. 

While the Alero only has dual front air bags, the vehicle is constructed with tubular door beams and strategically placed foam blocks to guard against side-impact injuries.

Rear seats are equipped with child seat anchors. 

When I purchased this vehicle 3 months ago, it was in mint-condition, and only had 20,100 miles on the odometer. The dealer was so anxious to make a sale, he actually paid my first month of insurance, threw in a full tank of gas, and also an oil change. After all was said and done, I walked off the lot having paid only $11,200 for a used vehicle that sells on the average for $12,300.
