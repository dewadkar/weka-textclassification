            I purchased my Coolpix 950 after doing extensive research on the various digital cameras currently available. The listed price was $999 locally and after some shopping managed to find a dealer selling the US version for $799.

The camera feels very solid, as it is made of metal. The zoom lens operates quickly and has a wonderful range for wide angle landscapes to portraits. There are several modes of operation from fully automatic to manual in addition to a memory that holds favorite settings. I find this very useful for holding information on Virtual Reality photography, keeping the settings I use most frequently.

On the down side, with all the abilities of this camera, there is a good amount of time involved in learning everything it is capable of. I spent a good hour learning the basics in the manual, then some additional time for the memory settings. In addition, I experience a lot of red-eye when photographing subjects in a casual setting. If the photos are pre-planned, I do use the red-eye reduction feature with better results, but don't enjoy the several pre-flashes before the main exposure. 

The image quality is super. I have taken the images into Photoshop and output 11x14 images that are picture perfect. I have even done some cropping and printed what would be a 16x20 with very good quality. An 80 Meg card holds over 300 regular images or over 50 high quality images.

I give the camera two thumbs up and would recommend it to everyone, especially as the price continues to come down.	<br><br>
