            Several months back this camera arrived at my workplace. No one was quite sure what to do with it, so I was assigned the task of working with it. We were all quite amazed that it didn't require a roll of film. *G*  We were equally delighted to find you could delete a picture immediately if it didn't turn out perfect. (No waiting for pictures to come back from developer before discovering you took a crummy picture!)

Considering I knew absolutely nothing about digital cameras, I found it easy to use. (Bear in mind that the most complicated camera I have ever used prior to this was an old 110-drop-in-the-film-cartridge, point-and-push-button model). The software that came with the AGFA ephoto780c
(photowise) was quickly and easily installed, and worked beautifully. I was thrilled that I didn't have to read through a tedious manual in order to take pictures and print them out...just a few clicks, and voila! Easy to figure out!

I thought it took fairly nice pictures, and was pleased. Boss was pleased as well, and before long I thought my job description had been changed to &quot;on the spot photographer&quot;. Quite a novelty item, quite popular.  Everyone else was scared of &quot;hurting&quot; it, so I was able to have free use of the camera for about six months or so, which is about how long it took before anyone else mustered up enough courage to try it.

In that six months, I learned a lot about this little camera, and a little about digital photography in general. It has been a pleasant experience.  Great camera to start with - pictures are clear enough, 
and the quality is pretty good considering the lower cost.

I would recommend this camera to any first time user, because of its simplicity, ease of use, and lower cost.  There are a few points about the camera that gave me cause to want a little better camera after a few months, however.

One downside is the size of the pictures..they are about regular snapshot size. A few times I have wanted a 5 x 7 or so, and this isn't the camera for that. But if you only need snapshot size, that's not a problem.

Another downside is that when using the flash, it would &quot;white out&quot; things in the picture if very close  - that is, make them look faded out or kind of white.  Taking closeups with a flash can be tricky.

While this camera took good pictures indoors, it was still best to be in a good light source - for whatever reason, dark items and very light items were hard for me to get very detailed pictures of, unless taken outside in good sunlight. Otherwise, the detail often did not show up, or show up very well.

Still - for snapshot size photos, ease of use, low cost - this camera does great.  It doesn't perform like a $900 camera because it isn't a $900 camera..but it performs very well for a less than $200 camera!

Be sure to have  a large supply of batteries - we went through a LOT. Getting rechargeables would be a good idea.  

All in all, pretty good! Now that others in my workplace have decided to try working with it, I no longer have free use of it - but it is still going strong and everyone using it is pleased.  I've now had the chance to use other,  higher end digital cameras and so am able to evaluate this one a little better now, by comparison - and I still think it's a pretty good first time camera, suitable for most everyday things. In time, you will want a better camera, but this is a great place to start. Just don't go showing everyone how easy it is to use, or you'll have everyone asking to borrow it!<br><br>
