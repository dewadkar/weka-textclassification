            I finally decided to purchase one of these nifty gadgets, I'm very pleased with it so far.  As usual, before I purchase anything I research & read reviews and ultimately decided that all I needed was a decent 2 megapixel camera that would give me good image quality in varying environments(indoor, outdoor, day, night etc.) and that wouldn't eat up batteries like crazy.  The Sony DSC-P51 does both very well & a lot more.  It comes with two nickel-metal hydride rechargeable batteries, battery charger, wrist-strap, av & usb cable and 16 meg memory stick.  If you register the product online, Sony will give you a $20 credit redeemable for any digital camera accessory on their website.  So for $279.99, you're getting a good bang for your buck.  

Picture quality is excellent, when the camera is used correctly.  The manual will explain everything you need to know.  Colors are rich, resolution is sharp & no pixelation to be found anywhere.  The auto-focus lens is outstanding, the 2X optical zoom will get you very nice close-ups.    Taking pictures at night is easy with the twilight mode, though there will be about a two to three second delay for the camera to process the shot in that mode.  You can also shoot movies in mpeg format, with no sound.  Though there is no sound, it's still fun, you can shoot until your memory stick is filled up in 320 HQX, 320X240, or 160X112 resolution.  If you want more time to shoot movies you'll have to upgrade to a larger memory stick but most people would just invest in a camcorder.  Cam also includes multi-burst mode and clip-motion mode used to make animated GIFS.  You can view pictures and play movies on the lcd screen and do anything you'd like with them ie delete, resize, edit movies etc.  The lcd is nice and bright & menus are a snap to navigate through.  The included software is horrible, I wouldn't even suggest putting it on your hard-drive.  However, you will need the usb driver for the camera that is on the software cd.   

The included rechargeable batteries are absolutely powerful.  Battery life will surprise you, with the lcd screen off you can get up to THREE hours of shooting time.  The camera has a power-save feature, and though it darkens the lcd a tad it is pretty effective.  With the lcd screen on, you can get well over two hours battery life with the power-save feature on and it doesn't degrade the lcd screen quality much at all.

Hooking up the camera to your computer or your tv is very simple.  Showing pictures off on your tv to family & friends is fun. Copying pictures and movies to your hard-drive is as simple as drag & drop.  Then you can clear your memory stick to take more pictures.  Sony designed the camera very nicely, it's compact and pretty stylish looking.  Inserting batteries and memory sticks is a snap, and the lens closes automatically when you turn the camera off, so no worrying about lens covers.
