            The Kodak EasyShare CX6230 is a good personal digital camera. The camera is inexpensive (between $120-$140), it's sturdy, and very easy to use. 

The CX6230 camera is a good many extras for the price. The camera has a zoom lens, night time mode, burst mode (for taking several quick shot pictures), and an easy to follow menu option and review mode. The camera comes with the USB hook-up cable and also included are cables for TV picture viewing. The docking cradle is included if one wishes to purchase the picture printing unit, which is an available option. 

After using this camera, I find it to be very easy to use and manage. The pictures are easily downloaded to one's personal computer. The pictures are of good quality. Managing the photo albums and pictures are very user friendly. The manual and menu options on the camera are very well explained. Within about fifteen minutes I was using the camera, and having no problems. 

The camera is compact, about the size of a disposable camera. It is a sturdy camera, not fragile, or overly sensitive. The camera internal memory will take and save about twenty-one pictures before downloading. By purchasing a memory card (they vary in size) one can add the memory capacity by 150-250 pictures before having to download. 

This is a wonderful, inexpensive, digital camera and a great digital camera for the novice; or as a beginners camera. Digital cameras give the user so many more options than traditional cameras, and the Kodak EasyShare CX6230 is a great digital camera for one to initiate themselves into the world of digital photography.
