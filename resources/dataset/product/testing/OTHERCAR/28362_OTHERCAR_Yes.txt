            I have owned three Lexus in the past (ES 300, LS 400 and the RX300).  Wanted to trade the RX on the new LS430, so I started car shopping.  The LS430 is a beautiful car, but wow, the price has gone up to $72000+ (remember when the Lexus was introduced it was high quality/luxury for around $45,000!).  Anyway, on a whim, I thought before I part with this kind of money I really should take a look at the S-Class Mercedes that all the auto magazines were raving about.  So, I took a test drive in a S-430 Sedan. 
I bought the MB S-430.  Right there and then.  It is the most luxurious, classy, well-built, top notch handling car I have every driven.  It's really something out of the ordinary.  The quietness of the car is incomparable to anything else that I have driven.... this quiet adds to the feeling of top-notch quality.  The car has lots of electronic do-dads that will keep a gadget fan like me busy for the next few years of ownership. Cool things like a standard GPS navigation system, top notch Bose sound system, rear view mirror with a built in motor that remembers your setting just like the seat settings, doors with little motors that close the door if you don't shut the door properly, keyless entry, window glass that prevents infrared radiation from passing into the car, and so many other useful (and some would probably say, not so useful) features.  My feeling is that for the price of the car it is loaded with all these features... makes it seem worth the price.
Regarding handling:  the MB really has the Lexus beat here.  The MB has an adjustable ride from soft to firm... even on the soft settings its handling is absolute perfection!  The feeling of confidence in controlling the automobile is well developed here.<br><br>
