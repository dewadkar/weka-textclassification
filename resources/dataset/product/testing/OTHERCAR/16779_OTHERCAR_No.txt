            This was my wife's car before we got married.  It was a nice looking car, but the 2.5L engine had too many problems.  At 93,000 miles casually driving to church, the head gasket blew.  The cost of repair was $500.00.  We were told that they had to machine the head surface because it warped.  After this repair, the heater never heated well again and it seemed like the engine had less power.  A couple years later at $120,000 miles, the head gasket blew again.  Again, we were told that the head had warped and we needed a new head.  I asked the service consultant about putting it back together without machining the head and he told me that there would be guarantee, but it might run good enough to trade it.  So I took his advise and got rid of the car.
