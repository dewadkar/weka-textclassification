            The outstanding s500, I actually have the privilige to drive one every now and then because my dad just got a 2000 s500.  It is very quiet and very smooth, acceleration is very strong, 0-60 in 6.2 seconds, the government limits the top speed.  You can make the shocks stiffer for a more sportier drive with a touch of a button.  You can also raise the car about an inch with a touch of a button.  rear seats have unbeleivable amount off room, you will never hear your children fus in the back.
