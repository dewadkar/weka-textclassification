              I purchased my first Jeep second hand in high school. It was an old military issue MULE and had a lot of hard miles on it. I fell in love. I drove it till it fell apart and couldn't be fixed. I have since owned a Chevy, GMC, and a Ford SUV, but this January I went back to Jeep. You can't beat the dependability or the low maintenance cost of any Jeep product. Although the cost of fuel is slightly higher, it balances out with the low upkeep. After purchasing my '90 Cherokee Laredo, i drove it from Texas to Connecticut straight through, stopping only to rest. It didn't miss a beat. I drive it 100+ miles a day to and from work and its still going strong. If i had to pick one thing I DO dislike about my Jeep, (and it's hard to find anything to dislike) it would be the turning radius. Not really able to make sharp, into a tight space turns without the tires rubbing the side walls, but it's an off-road monster in a city street size, so I guess you give a little but get alot. If you need an occasional off-road vehicle, but still want the roomy car, then Jeep is for you. But please drive responsible. Its not for those tearing around the streets drive. <br><br>
