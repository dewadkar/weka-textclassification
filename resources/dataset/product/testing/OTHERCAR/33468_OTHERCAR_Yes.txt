            I own a Chevy Cavalier Z24, the one that is pictured above, color and all.  Her name is Shadie because she's so dark and tinted.  I bought this car a year ago for $4500, and she's still going strong!

Shadie takes me to school an hour away from where I live 5 days a week, and she's gotten me there safely every day.  I have had no major problems with this car.  I recently had to get the starter replaced, but that has been my ONLY semi major repair in a year.  My last cars were HORRIBLE compaired to this one.  They practically lived in the auto repair shop!

This is a good car for your college aged kid because it looks nice and is relatively inexpensive to purchase and maintain.  It is a bit of a gas hog, but doesn't run you broke.  I go to college full time at a major university and rent my own house and have no problem affording the gas or maintenance. 

As is expected with any car, keep up on you tune ups and oil changes.  Get any possible problems looked at right away so they don't get worse.  If you do these things you should enjoy your Shadie for a long time.  I just brought mine up over 100,000 miles and you wouldn't know by the way she runs!<br><br>
