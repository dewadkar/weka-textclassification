            We leased our '99 Passat GLS in Oct '98. Granted, it was already a year old by the time we got it because of the way VW handles the production of their cars, but we didn't mind. We wanted a car that had unique styling... something not along the lines of the Accord and Camry... 

The Passat style was copied to the Jetta as well.

We had our Passat for 11 months and in that time, the only things wrong with it was the side mirror adjustment know broke off and the center arm rest came loose. (both fixed under warranty)

The engine had plenty of power for a turbocharged 4 cyl, the car had plenty of room for our family. It averaged 31 MPG according to the computer onboard...

All in all a pleasant experience with the Passat.

We even got to experience the safety features even though we did not want to. The drivers side air bag deployed in a side impact that totaled the car.

It was hit in the left front fender by a pickup truck going 40 and the car was waiting for a right turn...

The bag deployed and quite possibly saved the life of the driver.

It would be nice if we still had it.

Great car

The factory warranty could be a bit longer lived... 36mo/36000 mile is standard on almost all cars, the 24mo/24000 mile offered by VW is a bit cheap.<br><br>
