            I bought my Avalon to make driving more enjoyable.  I drive approximately 400 miles a week on an interstate highway.  I had a Toyota Corolla which was an excellent car for in-town driving but for prolonged periods left a lot to be desired.  My Avalon is comfortable for all passengers and for me.  It is a 6 cylinder and has all the power necessary for passing yet is quiet and handles terrific.

I love the sleek, elegant look and the comforts that it offers; such as a CD and cassette player, power everything yet it still gets 30 miles per gallon of gas.  The only negatives that I have encountered are the cup holders are not large enough to hold a 20 bottled drink and if there is anything plugged into the cigarette lighter (such as a cell phone) the ash tray has to be open which makes it difficult to place things in the storage area of the console.

Anyone who enjoys an economical car with a touch of class should definitely consider the Avalon.  I will never own any other car other than a Toyota and the Avalon is the best of the best.  <br><br>
