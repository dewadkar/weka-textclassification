            I recently purchased a new QX4. I was definitely influenced by its good looks and quiet ride, love the sound system and luxurious interior finish but I have to admit that the seats sold me.  I drive a great deal in the course of my job and through the years have tried back pillows, rolled up towels and anything anyone recommended to make car seats more comfortable usually to no avail. The seats in the QX4 are wonderful and even after hours of driving I don't have any back or neck pain.

The lines of this vehicle are good and in my opinion it's the best looking SUV on the market. The front is roomy and comfortable on long trips.  The back is comfortable for three kids or two adults- three adults on &quot;around town&quot; jaunts. The sound system is truly wonderful and (unlike most vehicles) the fade really does work, so you can listen to your tunes up front or let the kids listen to theirs in the back without inflicting them on yourself. The rear hatch is easy to use and convenient, but I still haven't figured out how to remove the cargo cover so more stuff can be crammed in. The auto 4-wheel is also wonderful; in &quot;auto&quot; it will detect slippage and apply the appropriate amount of 4-wheel drive needed.

The warranty also had a great bearing on my choice. I drove the Nissan Pathfinder, both Honda SUVs, the Mitsubitsi Montero, Ford's Eddie Bauer, the GMC Jimmy, Nissan's Exterra, and the Olds Bolero. None of them had a warranty or ride that could compete.  Infiniti offers a bumper to bumper four year/60,000 mile warranty and if anything goes wrong they will come get you- anywhere in the U.S., provide you with a loaner while your car is repaired and reunite you with your car at your intended destination. The power train is warranted for six years or 70,000 miles.  

Now for the complaints. There's really only one- not enough power. The QX4
has adequate power for running around but could really use more in passing situations. I wouldn't try to tow anything with it.  The gas mileage is acceptable but not great- city MPG 15 /highway MPG 18- pretty typical of this size SUVs on the market.<br><br>
