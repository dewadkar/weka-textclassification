            This is one incredible car!  I never really though this car would be this good.  I have had no problems with my car beyond the regular maintenance items.  I have driven my car around the United States two times and from Florida to the Arctic Circle in Alaska and after 120,000 miles there are still no problems.  I have taken this car down city streets, logging trails and on the worst highways in the USA and Canada and it still runs like a champ.  This car gets about 40mpg on the highway and somewhere in the high 20's to low 30's in the city.  This particular car is a standard and has the SOHC engine.  Personally, I would recommend the same setup as above.  I have had friends that bought an automatic and it lacked the power of the standard.  For those of you that want and inexpensive vehicle that can get up and go, this is the one for you.  Since I bought this car I have installed some bolt on accessories and this car is pretty impressive.  Mind you that there are a lot of lemons out there and some of them are new so you may see and hear some bad things but from what I see, this is a great car, and trust me I drive pretty hard.  For those of you that do not work on your own vehicles the overall cost of repairs are pretty low. There is no doubt in my mind that this has to be the best value in a sport compact out there.<br><br>
