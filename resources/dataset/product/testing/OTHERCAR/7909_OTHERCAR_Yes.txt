            Do you like to take pictures? Moreover, do you like to take <i>clear</i>, SHARP, and <b>bold</b> pictures? Then seriously consider investing in digital photography with the Canon Power Shot A20.  I've had many 35mm cameras that have just outlasted their usefulness.  It got too tedious just to keep getting film and running to get it developed.  Although Digital cameras won't replace 35mm (especially if you lack a photo-quality printer and gobs of ink), they do offer an excellent way of taking hundreds of pictures effortlessly and a great way to archive them on simple computer media.  The A20 is very simple to use and includes an 8MB Compact flash card (which will hold about 7 pictures at the best quality).  I'd honestly suggest getting a 64MB or 128MB card if you intend to take this baby on vacation or to that two day retreat.

    This camera will take at least 300 shots with a rechargable NiMH battery (a must).  The camera takes 4 batteries, so I'd buy a charger and two sets of four batteries to go along, so you can have a back up pair.

     The pictures this camera takes simply blows me away.  When I looked at some simple nature shots I took, the depth and vividness of the photograph actually made the trees' leaves <b>jump</b> out at me.  

     The list price of this camera is $399, though I found it for about $315 on DigiExpo.com.  So use that extra money you save for accessories!
