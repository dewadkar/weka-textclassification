            First, let me start of by prefacing this review with the fact that I have leased my Alero since April, 2000.  I am generally satisfied with the car, mostly due to the great price I paid.  When I was in the market for a new vehicle I was looking for a modest size vehicle for an economical price.  The Alero fit the bill.  The sticker price on which the lease was based was $17,100.00 for a loaded GL 4-cylinder, which makes my lease payment about $240.00 per month.  

For this great price you get power locks, power windows, power drivers seat, leather interior, cruise, air-conditioning, AM/FM/CD/Cassette, automatic trunk release from interior or key fob; keyless-entry & alarm, Tire-Pressure monitoring system, Oil-Quality Monitoring system, 16-inch alloys on Goodyearï¿½s, 4 wheel disc brakes, Anti-Lock Brakes, Traction Control, and a 150HP 2.4 liter 4-cylinder engine.

You might look at this long list of features and say, "you get ALL OF THAT for only 17K!!??  This is true.  My Alero has everything a top-of-the-line GLS would have except the V6 engine and the dealer-installed sunroof (which I've read is prone to leaking).  I got a great deal on this car brand new.  The car has been reliable, as it should be since it now has only 22,000 miles on the odometer.  Here is the breakdown:

Interior:
The Alero interior will not take your breath away with breathtaking interior design.  Everything is where it should be and is pretty much standard American automaker design.  The leather is definitely worth springing for since it gives the interior of the car a much more elegant and more-expensive look.  A couple of gripes about the interior are: floor mats are rather cheap-looking and are worn down very easily; no "grab-handles" above the front passenger door or rear doors for drivers or rear seat passengers, for those riding with a driver who like to take hair-pin turns or passengers who have difficulty getting out of the Alero's low seats (i.e. my pregnant wife);  the car stereo become alarmingly hot when in use for more than 30 minutes.

Exterior:
The exterior of the car is very appealing in my opinion.  When I was looking for a vehicle, it came down to the 2000 Mitsubishi Galant or the 2000 Olds Alero.  I liked the styling of the Galant better but the price of the Alero was tough to beat and the engine has more spunk.  The Alero is a great looking automobile, especially at night when its VERY bright fog laps are blazing a path for it through the night sky.  The 16-inch Aluminum Alloy spoked wheels do a lot for the mildly aggressive look of the vehicle.

Engine:
The Alero has a strong but very noisy 4-cylinder engine.  If you floor it with the automatic, you will squeal the tires.  The engine could really use some refinement however, as it sounds to much like a farm tractor when pushed hard.  I suspect that GM had to make some concessions in order to squeeze 150HP out of this engine.  Another gripe is fuel economy.  The transmission seems to be tuned very aggressively.  It shifts way up in the higher rpms of each gear. This drags fuel economy down considerably.  I usually get no more than 18MPG in the City and 23MPG on the highway.  This is atrocious for a car this size and a 4-banger engine. 

Overall:
The Alero turned out to be a vehicle with mixed results for me in these last 22 months.  I have been back to the dealer on several occasions.  When I first purchased the car, I noticed a slight defect in the plastic just above the radio housing.  It was not very obvious but I noticed it the first day I had the vehicle and I demanded that the dealer replace it.  The dealer tried to avoid having to replace the piece and told me it may not be covered under warranty (The usual B.S. dealers say).  Finally, the dealer said "GM had approved the repair" and it was fixed.  It must also be noted that the Alero has a rotor problem that GM refuses to acknowledge (see alero.org).  Within the first 14,000 miles, the dealer had to replace both front rotors TWICE.  After the second time and on the way home from the dealer, I felt the same vibrations in the front end when braking at highway speeds.  I brought it back to the dealer, they checked it, and told me that the warped rotors they had just repaired had damaged my pads and they needed to be replaced for $200.00.  The dealer refused to pay for the new pads even though the rotor defect had obviously caused the damage.  I fought with the dealer, called GM directly, to no avail.  Finally, I brought the car to my VERY honest local Midas dealer who put new pads on for me and had to turn the rotors AGAIN because he said that in fact the dealer hadn't even turned them, never mind replaced them.  The car runs better now with the Midas pads (which have a lifetime warranty) than the garbage original GM factory pads.  I felt very cheated by my local dealer and will not buy another GM vehicle because of it. I should also mention that a front strut failed at 20,000 miles also, and had to be replaced by the dealer.

If you want a cheap payment for a loaded and larger than compact car, attractive styling, and an American product, buy it.  However, be prepared to return to the dealer at least 3-4 times in the first year and be prepared to haggle with the dealer over brake problems, which have plagued GM vehicles for a while.  My next vehicle will be a Toyota (or hopefully a Lexus :)  But the Alero has filled the bill as a cheap way to drive a new car loaded with features at a great price.
