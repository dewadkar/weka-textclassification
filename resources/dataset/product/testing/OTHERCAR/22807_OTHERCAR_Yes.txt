            I wont lie, the Cadillac Escalade is a beautiful, well designed truck.  It has plenty of power and more than enough luxury.  Unfortunately, the Cadillac Escalade is just a GMC/Chevy Yukon/Tahoe with a little bit of plastic trim thrown on the sides.  When you can pick up a 2000 Chevy Tahoe with all options for about 35,000(if your a good bargainer) the Cadillac Escalade runs about 43,000 to 50,000 depending on the region you are in when buying.  Recently while i was at the Pheonix Auto Show, I had a chance to view both at about 100 yards away from each other and the only thing different really is the exhaust tips, wheels, plastic trim, and the interior fake woodwork and silver handles.  Other than that, it is the exact same truck.  I dont mean to bash the Cadillac Escalade, but I think its just an excuse to jack the price up another 10 grand.  But, if you really want to sport the Cadillac name on your SUV and can afford too, then more power too you.  I own a 99 Chevy Tahoe and I haven't had any complaints about it except for there is a rotor problem with the front discs.  Most people i have talked to have had to replace them with aftermarket parts because the factory parts were out of round and the truck would shake when you applied the brakes.  This problem will also hold true with the Cadillacs, but it is easy to fix and can be done on your own for about 80 dollars.  It takes about 30 mins to an hour to change both the front pads and rotors.  The rotors come off with the loosening of a screw, and the brake pads are snap on!!!  It doesnt get any easier!!!  The vehicle rides like a towncar with the Bilstein shocks, but i have noticed it kind of rocks when making 90 degree turns.  The leather smells wonderful all the time, and the sound system can hold its own.  The factory window tint keeps the car cool on those hot summer days while the radiator and engine cooling system is the best i have ever seen!!!  You can drive all day in 100 degree weather and never get anywhere close to overheating.  The AC pumps out freezing breezes, and keeps you from sticking to the seats.  More nice interior features of the Tahoe/Yukon/Escalde include: seat heaters, electric seats(driver and passenger), automatic dimming mirrors(rear-view and side-view), compass and tempurature computer on the rear-view mirror, and the wonderful programable radio transmitters for up to 3 garage doors or gates.  The vehicle weighs about 7500 pounds and will tow a whole lot with a 350 Chevy V8 pushing 250 HP.  Another advantage is the automatic four wheel drive.  If ya start to slip, it kicks in on the fly and helps you get back on the road.  You can also change to full time 4x4 and low range 4x4, for those off roading situations, with the push of a button.  The passenger and cargo room in the Tahoe is amazing!!!  There is plenty of leg room in the back seats and still a massive amount of space in the cargo area.  Overall, the Chevy Tahoe, GMC Yukon, and Cadillac Escalade are all great vehicles and i would strongly recommend it to anyone who can afford it. <br><br>
