            Buy this car.  I have no interest in Toyota... no relatives at the factory.  But you can't possibly want anything more in an auto for general use.  I drive 2000 CE on the mean streets of Manhattan and Queens and on the highways and side streets of New York's Long Island.
   Ride is smooth, but it lets you know the road's there.  Maneuvers like a charm.  Good gas milage (I'm averaging 26 mpg overall.)

   It was perfect when I drove it off the lot.  It's still perfect.  Plenty of legroom (I'm tall,) sensible instrument positioning, easy to use controls, even while you're going 70... ooops, I mean 55.

    Not good for a family of six.  But two adults and two teens fit nicely.

    Wish it had just a little more pep.  I don't like 4-cyl. engines, ordinarily, but this one's plenty powerful except in climbing steep hills getting onto the highway.  A small concession.
    Nice extras.  There's a second power plug so you can use your cell phone without pulling out the cigarette lighter.  Rear cup holders.  Fabulous radio.  Strong, fast-acting air conditioner, and a FULL SIZE SPARE TIRE!
  Not a bad price, either.<br><br>
