            My family bought a Previa in 1991 and a Sienna last year. By far, the Sienna is the better of the two, although I miss the oddly shaped, but practical dash on the older model. Here are some more comprehensive details about the newer Toyota Sienna:

Reliability: So far, this minivan has been flawless in terms of mechanical and peripheral reliability. There has been no defect in any component that my family knows about, and it drives today just as well as it did off the showroom floor. I give this car a ten out of ten in terms of repairs/maintanance.

Driving: This minivan was built on the Camry flatform, so it has a good ride, especially for a minivan. In fact, it drives a lot like a car, too. The power steering was coordinated just right so that it's neither overasisted nor underassisted. The V-6 engine has fairly typical power for a minivan. It's not a slowpoke, but it's far from being a speed demon. Fuel efficiency is also about average. The transmission shifts very smoothly...no trouble there. Noise is low at low and high speeds. In government crash tests, the Sienna did extremely well.

Comfort- My Sienna is the upgraded model with leather seats and a front sunroof. The seats are comfortable (and definately improved over the old Previa) with fine back support, although I prefer more cushioning. My model also comes with quad seating meaning there are bucket middle seats. The rear is a bit cramped, but there are air conditioning vents in the roof for ever passenger, except the middle of the rear row. The ride is soft enough to be considered comfortable.

Design and features: The Sienna comes with a good deal of features. Mine has a CD/tape/radio, power windows and door locks, leather seating, air conditioning, keyless entry, dual airbags, ABS, alarm, and a sunroof. The seats in the rear and middle of the car can be removed, although they weigh quite a bit. With the seats installed, however, there isn't a terribly large amount of storage area. (With them outm there's a ton).

Unfortunately, this Toyota is not cheap. My family paid a little over $25,000 for our minivan. For that price, I'd prefer the Oldsmobile Silhouette Premier with the TV and surround sound for the kids to watch in the back (although, i've always had a lean towards American cars, so you can take that comment with a grain of salt). I recommend this auto for those who insist on a high quality, low maintanance minivan and don't mind paying the extra cash. For value oriented customers, however, consider another brand.<br><br>
