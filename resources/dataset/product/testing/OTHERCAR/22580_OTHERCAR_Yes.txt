            I've never been the type to be too impressed with cars and other material goods. However, I've always thought the f-body (Firebird, Camaro & Trans-AM) models from the 80's and early 90's were some cool looking cars, so when a '91 Firebird caught my eye at a dealer's lot, I borrowed $1900 and took home the pink slip.

Up until that point I had been driving a perfectly ugly gray 4-cylinder 1987 Dodge Omni, so this car was definitely a big change, and for the better. The vehicle handles well at most times, although it gets a sometimes little hairy on very wet roads. I haven't had the 'pleasure' of driving on snow or ice yet, but I'd imagine it won't be too pretty. Still, the general handling of the car is nice. 

Of course this car is fast. Mentioning that fact is a bit like saying that a grizzly bear is large - it's kind of unnecessary. I don't race at all, so I can't tell you much about that side of it, but I'd imagine that if one of those little 5.0 Mustangs managed to get ahead of this car at the beginning, it wouldn't stay out front too long. This thing has a ton of top end. This is especially true if you have the 5.7 liter model. I have the 5.0 and it has all the power and speed I need, and more.

Reliability has been great for me. I've had the car for about 8 months now, and I haven't had a single problem worth writing about. Some fuses blew, and that's about the extent of it. This is especially encouraging, because my Firebird has over 212,000 miles on it. There may have been some rebuilding done to the engine at some point, but a lot of the car is original parts. It starts up easily even in cold weather (without stepping on the gas at all), idles smoothly, and runs without rattling, misfiring, or other unsettling noises. 

The interior of the car looks cool, but it isn't quite as comfortable as it could be. It's no big deal, because this is a sports car, but long trips might get a little fidgety. The back seat, of course, is unmentionable. It's tiny and is not any real place to put an adult for more than 10 or 20 minutes. Such passengers would probably be more comfortable in the trunk area, which is actually reasonably large. ;)

The paint on my car is its biggest drawback. I've read on a couple websites that environmental legislation in California caused some of the 1991 Firebird models to be painted with inferior materials, which ends up causing the paint job to break down earlier than it should. My car shows evidence of large peeled areas on the hood, which the previous owner tried to cover with green spray paint. Too bad the car's finish is blue. The resulting ugliness is probably a big part of why I was able to pick this car up for such a reasonable price. Not all of the '91 Firebirds have paint problems, though, so you should take a careful look at the paint and see for yourself if it looks questionable.

You're going to buy a lot of gas for this car, unless you get the V-6 model. All V-8 engines guzzle gas, this one is no exception. You might also smell gas when getting in and out of the car, this is due to a minor problem with the fuel filler neck on some of the cars. There is a recall, and Pontiac has to fix this for free, but I haven't really bothered worrying about it.

All in all, I like my car. It's fast, looks cool (aside from the paint), and runs reliably. It seems to be a good one, but be aware that there are lemons out there in every make and model. Each car should be checked out individually, don't just decide to buy (or avoid) the Firebird because of what you read here. This information is just my experiences, presented to help you make an informed decision.
