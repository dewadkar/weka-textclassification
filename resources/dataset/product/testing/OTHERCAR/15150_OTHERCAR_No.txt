            My 1996 Grand Am GT failed to live up to the reliability standards I expected for this car.  In the year and a half that I owned this vehicle, it had to have three new alternators and two front brake jobs.  I would suggest to anyone interested in buying this model that they first do some research into consumer reports before taking a chance with this car.

However, not everything on this car was disappointing.  I think the design of the car is pretty decent.  In fact, I've never been in a car with such comfortable seats.  Furthermore, all the gauges were easy to read and everything was placed in an easy-to-use manner.<br><br>
