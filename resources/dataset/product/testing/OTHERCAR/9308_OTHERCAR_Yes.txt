            I am recently leasing this car and there can't be a better one out there.  It is what every man should be driving.  I still think that I am going to wake up any minute now.  The seats are nice and the car is extremly roomy.  My dying wish would be one last ride in this car.  I bought this vehicle because I wasn't really sure what to get then I thought of my father's mercedes 10 years old and still runing strong.  So I thought I to would make the safe buy and go with a mercedes also.  Let me tell you something I am not regreting it one bit.  You may think It costs a lot but in the long run it is a better buy.  This vehicle had no visits to the shop at all last year! None!!  The ride is also dead queit with the top up but when you have the top down it feels like the car will lift off the ground and start to fly.  I recomend this car for anyone with a job demanding a nice looking car or anyone who wants on of the best  and most reliable cars in the world.<br><br>
