            My wife and I were going to Alaska and we needed a new camera. We had waited for the digital cameras to get good and the Canon Powershot G1 didn't disappoint!

After a week of frolicing around the great white north, the only thing we regret is not buying enough memory for this great little camera.

When we purchased the camera we also bought a 341 mg IBM microdrive. The only thing we regret is not buying the 1 gig microdrive. If you are taking high quality pictures -- get more memory with the camera. The 16 mg card that comes with this camera has yet to be used and would hold about 7 high quality pictures from this camera.

Having the camera a week before we left, I played around with it quite a bit before our trip. So I was no expert at running that camera by any means. 

The two features that make this camera great are the movies -- it will record up to 30 seconds of movies -- and the panoramic picture mode. Both features are excellent and make this camera a great product. Battery life is also VERY impressive. We brought 2 batteries and only ended up using the spare after 8 hours of constant use. Very, very nice.

The weaknesses of this camera are the LCD viewer is a bit small, but it does rotate 360 and is VERY useful, and for some reason there were a few instances where the camera would not focus fast enough. This could be just due to my inexperience with the camera however. The LCD display really worries me, because I am afraid I am going to break it off -- there are some plastic parts on this camera that look a little flimsy, but overall operations are solid.

After the trip I downloaded the 340 megs of pictures and I have been VERY impressed with the quality. Having a program like Photoshop to adjust settings and cropping pictures is a useful tool with this camera. 

Downloading and installing the software for this camera is a breeze. I had no issues and it works perfectly everytime with my USB connection. 

The panoramic shots are GREAT! Excellent feature and you can't even tell where one picture stops and another begins when they are "stitched" together.

If I had it to do over again, I would purchase this camera and more memory. If you think you should buy more memory -- buy more you WILL need it if you are on a trip!
