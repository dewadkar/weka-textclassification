            Talk about mixed feelings!  How can I love my Beretta and hate it at the same time?  I haven't been this emotionally confused since falling in love with a beautiful, but schizophrenic girl back in 1991. (Which must have been an omen since that's when I bought the Beretta, my first brand-new car, that I'm still driving.) 

While &quot;Linda&quot; and I parted ways after about four years (or 50,000 miles, whichever came first), my Beretta and I have now been together for nearly a decade.  Which relationship has had a greater impact on my life has yet to be determined since I haven't yet been able to part ways with my Beretta.  Somehow I don't feel like a 'real man' because I haven't even given her (my Beretta) a name- I know that 'real men' name their cars, but I have never been able to think of an appropriate moniker for her.
(Notice that I do have the 'real man' quality of at least recognizing that 'my Beretta' is female.) To avoid confusion and save space going forward, I will simply refer to my loves as Linda (girlfriend-91 model) and MB (My Beretta-91 model).

Linda and MB originally impressed me with their beauty - Linda with her striking shiny red hair and MB with her bold blue shiny paint job. Linda
was able to hold her beauty as time passed while poor MB's beauty quickly faded and turned out to be only superficial.  MB's lustrous glossy paint job turned out to be only skin-deep.  Her skin began to peel off within our first year as a couple.  By the third year, she was mottled with large areas of silver where her paint had mysteriously stripped itself from her body.  I compared notes with many others who owned Berettas (MB's sisters) and learned that this is a common disease which apparently runs in the family.  Take a look on the highway tomorrow- any Beretta you see will have this dreaded genetic trait- random areas of peeled paint surrounded by areas of glossy perfection. I took pride in being a 90's kind of guy and knowing that our bond went beyond the superficial idea of beauty.

Sometime in the third year, both Linda and MB began breaking down on a regular basis.  Linda's breakdowns set me back the cost of a dozen roses while MB's breakdowns cost me the equivalent of an entire truckload of rare orchids.  They both started out small - a crying jag here and an alternator there.  While Linda at least kept it interesting by developing new problems each time, MB started to become boringly predictable by repeating her past failures again and again.  She was never satisfied and insisted on four separate alternators in a three year period.  When we finally agreed on one she could live with, she started nagging me about new brakes.  Over the past 8 years, MB has gone through 6 entire sets (both axles) of brakes (the whole works- pads, rotors, discs, etc.)!

Once again I consulted with my fellow MB lovers and discovered that this is also a family trait.  Love a Beretta and be prepared for alot of time spent at Midas pacing in the waiting room while she gets a yearly makeover costing several hundred dollars.  But can you really put a price on love?!
    
Through the years, Linda left me stranded on the side of the road exactly twice.  MB has left me stranded on the side of the road at least twice PER YEAR!  Each time I have taken the blame---if only I had had her serviced at the manufacturer recommended intervals---if only I hadn't pushed her so hard.  How could I blame her for blowing a head gasket (3 times) or throwing a rod (twice)?!  

Why are MB and I still together many years after Linda and I parted ways?
Linda couldn't handle my fast-paced lifestyle...MB may occasionally complain, but all in all she has stuck with me through 130,000 miles of my abuse.  

Linda was replaced for free.  To replace MB would cost me about $16 Grand and because that's about the same amount I've poured into her over the years- I choose to believe the fantasy that she'll make it for another 5 years and face the reality that she hasn't left me with enough money to replace her. I think she planned it that way.  She aint   
pretty anymore, but she's dependable at least 95% of the time---about twice Linda's reliability factor.  I think I'll keep her!
