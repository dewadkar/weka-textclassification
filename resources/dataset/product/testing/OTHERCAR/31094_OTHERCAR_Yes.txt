            What can I say about the Toyota Tundra?  I just love it! My husband vowed years ago that after our youngest graduated from college that he was &quot;gonna go out and buy me a truck!&quot;  After doing some research online (this was very unconventional for him) and visiting a few lots, he returned home with this wonderful vehicle at which I initially turned up my nose (afterall,it was a truck). 

I was happy for my husband for he acted like a little boy of years ago who just received his first Tonka toy.  Well, boys and girls, this IS a toy on a larger scale.  Rides incredibly.  Beautiful interior, knockout audio system, security alarm, and attractive chrome accented railings and side step bars (he said he got for me for easy access; wasn't that sweet?!) Since it's a four-door, the back seat is  comfortable though it could be a bit more spacious. 

And, ladies, it drives even better.  Guys, you'll be impressed.  It responds immediately, powerfully with that V-8 engine whenever you accelerate.  With constant congestion in our area, it's a plus to be able to sit elevated where I can more affectively assess the traffic conditions.  I was even more pleased with the price and deal my husband obtained. I was not very enthusiastic about pickup trucks but the Toyota Tundra is a hottie with a touch of class and has changed my opinion for sure!!<br><br>
