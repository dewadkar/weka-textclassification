            After years of my doors getting dinged and ending up upside down when trading vehicles in, I finally woke up and smelled the coffee and realize that cars are a horrible investment.  That's about the time I was passing the Hyundai dealership on the way home from work and decided to stop in.  I ended up coming home with a base model 2002 Hyundai Accent L.  This was what they referred to as the "ad car".  The "ad car" is the car they put in the newspaper to lure prospective buyers in, with the intention of talking them up to a more expensive model with 'more acceptable' features.  Well, I didn't care, I just wanted the ad car.  So the ad car I got.

The 2002 Accent is a great car if you are looking for something inexpensive to get you around.  If you are looking for something to drive on long road trips, this is not the car for you.  We just took it on a 12 hour drive, and I have never experienced that level of soreness in my backside in my life.  I was even sitting on a fluffy pillow.  

The Accent gets around 27 mpg in the city, and up to 37 on the highway.  The 5 speed manual transmission is very easy to shift and control.  The 13" tires are a bit small, but when it comes time to get new tires, I would hope the bill would be a bit less as well.  The 10gal gas tank is plenty, and when its time to visit the gas station, you will always feel lucky to get such great mileage.

I've now owned my Accent for about 6 months and have not had a single ounce of problems.  Hyundai's 5 year 50,000 bumper to bumper warantee is a great deal as well, or you can extend it to 10/10000 for an extra $1000 or so.

All in all, this car is worth the money if you are looking for a budget car to get you around the city.  If you're looking for comfort, this is not the car for you.
