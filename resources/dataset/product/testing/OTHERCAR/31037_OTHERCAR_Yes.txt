            I had an SE, would highly recommend the turbo-charged SE-R model as it would get better performance.  as it was, the SE had a decent four-banger when mated with the manual transmission, gave me a decent amount of oomph.  and the mechanics of the car were virtually trouble free.  I bought mine with  50,000 miles on it, put another 30,000 on it and all I have done is changed the brake pads, and put some new tires on, and changed the oil.

Comfort level is high in this car, good seats, and a suprisingly roomy rear seat for a small 2door car.  trunk space is about what you'd expect with a small pass-through to a 60-40 split folding rear seat.  that helped out a couple of times in transporting some large objects.
