            I started with a 1998 Ram 1500, this was my first mistake. The gas engines in these trucks just don't cut it. It was so gutless that the tires would not spin in mud fast enough to clean them. I then made the second mistake of saying I would never own another Dodge. I now have a 1999 Ram 2500 Quad Cab with a Cummings diesel engine. If anybody is like me, you hate having to downshift to make a hill. I have not had to downshift in the 10 months and 13000 miles. Even though this is a 6 cyl 360 ci engine, it really pulls. The first thing I did was take it to Florida. It loves to run and it makes you watch the speedo close if your not using the cruise. I picked up a 3000 lb trailer and towed it home. Never knew it was there. Up hill, down hill, side hill, this truck pushes on without working. It lacks a little on reaching passing speed, but that isn't why we buy trucks. The turbo is pure music. I personally don't mind a little engine music as I tool down the highway, however, the wife and kids get awfully tired of having to repeat themselves. This won't be a problem if you don't want to hear them to begin with. I love the power, but the noise??? If your looking to get this for a dual purpose, truck and family car, don't. The back seat is cramped if your over 48 inches tall. If you want the back seat for storage then fine. If your wanting raw power and a little noise won't bother you, this is the one for you.<br><br>
