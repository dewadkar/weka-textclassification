            This is the hottest camera on the market.  While it comes at a hefty price you will save money in the long run.  With an additional $150 investment in a photo printer you will never have to go to the film developer again.  Thus the big savings.  In terms of the functionality, it really brings the amateur Photographer to the Pros.  May favaorites functionality is the portrait.  This allows you to focus on a subject while blurring the background.  This is very dramatic and almost un heard of functionality in digital cameras less than $1,000.  You should not spend more that $1,000 (pre-tax) on the camera.  I have seen prices consistently at around $825.  Aslo note that there are rebate programs on the Sony web site.  To qualify for the rebate you need the UPC code from the box and the original reciept.

The camera has a lot of functionality that is not hard to figure out.  It is very easy to use and you will find you will become a better photographer .  

It is perfect for the Amateur photographer who really takes photos seriously.
