            I am having my friend Frank and riding with buzzing traffic in the Durango!  He is not being my boyfriend!  He is having the happiest of wife and little girl.  In traffic, we are sitting up high on the Durango and can see far across the roofs of taxis.  They are like yellow bugs to us.

Outside, it is being very hot and poor when outside and getting nothing but wet from exercise or just standing.  We are getting lunch and coming back from it with many friends.  They are three in the seat behind and two more in the seat behind and looking near the window!  We are being very cool inside in rich seats that are like the couches.  With the air conditioner, it has vents all over in the front and in the back and is making sure we are very cool.  I am very cool!  We sing our small song for the joy it is to be being cool when others are so hot.  They wilt in front of us and are having not joy at that.  I am telling you.

Before I am riding in the Durango, I am noticing on the hood is a v8.  It is being a very big engine and taking lots of gas.  My friend Frank is being always at the gas station in the city.  And there is no zoom in the engine when we are driving and being cool.  My friend Frank is stepping on the gas pedal and we are going not one place forward!  It is very poor to see.  I am hoping my epinions friends will not be in a driving Durango if they are in the city.  People are everywhere and cars and there is not one big place to park!  It is most poor to be having your Durango in a squeezing spot in the garage on any level.  But my friend Frank is saying for in the country and mountains for Kayaking it is being most gracious!<br><br>
