            I bought my 2000 Toyota 4Runner in October of 1999.  So far my 4Runner has had two vacations to Las Vegas.  It performed better than ever expected.  The wind on both trips was strong.  While other SUV'S and vehicles battled mother nature the 4Runner held its own and didn't look back.  Around town driving is the best and most fun.  Your seat is higher than most an you can feel safe and secure while your driving.  Toyota's are the best and most reliable vehicles on the road.  The saftey and security provided by Toyota is second to NONE.  You can feel confident purchasing this vehicle.  Now go buy one and don't look back.<br><br>
