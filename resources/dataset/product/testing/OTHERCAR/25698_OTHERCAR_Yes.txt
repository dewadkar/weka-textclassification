            Aah, where to begin? 
I purchased my 1995 Nissan Pathfinder SE-V6 used, almost 2 years ago (36K miles) for $16,800.  I had always loved that body style, and had wanted one for years.  Problem was I was in college and could not afford to purchase one in '95.  Once I had the steady income, I knew what I had to do.  And boy am I glad I did. In my humble opinion, the 95 Pathfinder is the best looking SUV on the road.  Apparently, there are others that agree as I am constantly getting compliments on it.  It has a rugged, tough looking body style that is rarely seen in todays more luxurious (dare I say wimpy) SUV's.  It provides ample room, which is another reason I purchased it.  You could curl up and fall asleep in the leather seats, and the back seat is the most comfortable around.  Aside from the somewhat average leg room, those back seats recline independently and have individual armrests.  On a recent 8 hour trip to Lake Powell, my wife slept the whole way back there.  The back also provides excellent space given that the spare is located on the back gate (a must option in my opinion).  I have put four people, camping gear and my 80lb Golden Retriever in there for a three hour trip with room to spare.
The ride is a bit stiff, but that comes in handy when off-roading.  Gas mileage is average for a sport utility, as I get anywhere from 19-22mpg depending on the driving condition.  My only complaint is that the 150hp V6 engine is a bit insufficient in the mountains.  More times than not, I have to keep it in 4th gear to maintain my speed. 
At this point in time, reliability has been good.  However, tomorrow it goes to the shop to fix an exhaust manifold problem that I understand is common for this model at around 60k miles (mine has 56K).  Luckily it is still under warranty.  I was told that Nissan has agreed to fix the problem free of charge within 5 years or 60k miles.  My warranty expires in 2 weeks, so I guess I got lucky there.
The stereo is impressive, with 8 speakers and an after market CD player.  Loud music causes a rattle in the door, although this could easily be fixed given a little effort.
Living in Colorado, I have many opportunities to get to the mountains, and this car is a great way to get there.  It provides a smooth highway ride, yet is tough when you need it to be.  Would I recommend a 1995 Pathfinder SE-V6?  Everyday of the week, and twice on Sunday.<br><br>
