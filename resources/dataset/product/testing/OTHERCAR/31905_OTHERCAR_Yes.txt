            I bought my first new car just one month ago, it of course being the 2001 Subaru Forester.  I wanted a car that I could take into the snow and sand, but not pay for it.  

My model is the five speed &quot;L&quot; model, but if you are serious about your off-road driving go with the Subaru S automatic.  This model is equipped with a more capable AWD than the other forester model because it adds a limited slip differential to the S package.  

The AWD system on the S model is also more effective at handling slippage and traction.  The AWD system is a complex piece of machinery that you should inquire at the dealership about.  For example, the AWD on the L stick model does not provide power to every wheel equally as some would think.  On normal driving situations the power train is going about 90% to the real wheels, and 10% to the front to give it a &quot;sporty&quot; feel, which it really is.  Sometimes I am very surprised at the acceleration I get out of this car.  During slipping or loss of traction the AWD system senses which wheel is slipping and will make that wheel spin more slowly.

After one month of driving that has included on and off road driving I can honestly say that I feel confident about my purchase. Do not purchase this car if you want to go mud hopping in serious stuff.  

This car is designed for some occasional snow, sand, and light off road duties. There is no Low gear for off-roading, and the four cylinder engine limits what you can do off the pavement.  What the horizontally opposed 4 cylinder loses in off-road performance makes up for in the city.  This is especially poignant with the current up-swing in gasoline prices.  In the city I usually tend to get about 20-22 mpg, and on long hauls about 27mpg.

The interior of the car is well spaced with ample head room and a wide view out front. The air conditioning in this car rules, and as of yet no problems with the non cfc cooled car.  The seats boast adjustable seat belts for those that are too big for a child seat or booster, but not quite big enough for a regular fit.  

I purchased a few extras that have added a nice touch, and a few un-forseen drawbacks.  I love the keyless/remote entry, but when I unlock or lock the door the car unleashes a loud beep, and I mean loud.  Above the radio there is a recessed cup holder which accomodates most every type of cup, but it has an awful habit of getting in my way when I shift, an extra that I would have placed elsewhere.
