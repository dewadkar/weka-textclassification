            Ok folks, I got this car on November 17, 2000.  While I can promise you I haven't had any major problems with my car, I can tell you it isn't amazing.  I got it in Navy blue with tan leather interior and no Nav system.  Since the 3.2 TL basically comes loaded, I had no options added on o my car.  The car that I bought is simply nothing more than a loaded Accord.

There are a few exterior differences such as the dual chrome exhaust on the TL and 16 inch wheels instead of 15's, but the overall price difference doesn't make the car much better.  I mean, even on my driver window there is a Honda sticker.  

The car has performed well in areas of strict performance such as acceleration and skid G's, but ergonomics such as MPG and Fuel tank size are disliked by me.  I hate how every 5 days I must stop for gas because the tank is only 17.7 gallons and the car guzzles fuel like there is no tomorrow.  I do however like the idea that you can leave your lights on and simply lock the car and the lights will go off automatically.

The seats are comfortable, but no more comfortable than the Accord I test drove.  Also, the back seat is a bit smaller in the TL for those of you transporting people.  The sound system is definitely my favorite part of the car, as I think it packs a 12-inch subwoofer in the backseat.  Of course it has tiptronic shifting which is fun, better very ineffective and the sunroof is always a nice toy.  But most of this stuff can be found on the Accord for a lower price.

To wrap it up, the Acura TL is a nice car, nothing to superior though, but you can get the same car, just with a less respected name for a few grand less if you choose the Accord.  It's simply a tossup in what you want more, flashiness or cash in your pocket.
