            I am a father of two, both under two years of age.  Our Nissan Pathfinder had been extremely reliable and great for a yuppie couple that liked to haul furniture and plants, but nimble enough to get around the streets of San Francisco, and when the moons were aligned, compact enough to squeeze into those impossible-to-find SF parking spots.  It wasn't until our recent road trip from the Bay Area to Los Angeles with the kids, that I realized we needed another SUV.  Two car seats take up the entire back seat and the storage space in the back was completely packed with luggage, strollers.

But it was the two babies crying in stereo for three hours that made me realize that the acoustics in the Pathfinder were less than desirable.

We arrive in Los Angeles, only to find that my folks had purchased a Lexus LX470...just to have now that the grandkids were in town.  I know, tough life.  We pretty much have been driving the Lexus LX470 every day for the past four months since we moved to LA.  Since then, we have driven in the Range Rover 4.6, the Cadillac SUV, and the Ford Expedition.  All fine SUVs, but none compares to the Lexus LX470 in several areas: 1) super smart interior design- there is no wasted space, the instrumentation is brightly lit, very accessible instrumentation and the interior is extremely roomy. 2)exterior does not look or feel bulky-feels as roomy inside as the other super SUVs, but the exterior looks and feels more aerodynamic. 3) great driving performance - The turning radius is terrific, nice acceleration, and the ride is sooo smooth. 4) and most importantly, best acoustics among the bunch.  The kids cried and for some reason, the sounds were absorbed into the fine leather surrounding us everywhere...or it could have been the great stereo system that can crank with the best of them.
