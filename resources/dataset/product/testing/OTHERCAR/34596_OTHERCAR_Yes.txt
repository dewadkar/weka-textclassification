            I bought the Saturn SC2 because I heard they were very reliable and well built.  Besides that, the price was perfect.  No where else can you get all the features that Saturn offers for the price they offer.  The car is also unbelievably safe.  I was in a minor accident and could not believe how my Saturn held up and even more, how it protected me.  The car is comfortable, sleek looking, and handles well in all types of weather, especially the snow and ice.  If looking for a compact car that is dependable, well built, sleek looking, and safe for you and your entire family....the Saturn is perfect.  Not to mention Saturn service is the best service I have ever received.  And that is what makes everything so much better.<br><br>
