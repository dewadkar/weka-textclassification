               I bought my 95 Prelude (blue, no spoiler, buzzsaw wheels and low-profile tires, EXACTLY what I wanted) from a national used-car &quot;superstore&quot; a year and a half ago.  I hope it never dies, because I can't imagine ever growing tired of the car.  I would have held out for a VTEC model, but the VTEC tends to bump the price up by $500-$1000.  My price was about $14000 with a host of really nice features, including a custom CD stereo installation that really rocks.  Thankfully, the previous owner had the good taste to opt out on the obnoxious subwoofer and any exhaust system modifications.

   Not knowing enough about Prelude body styles when I was looking to buy, I looked at this car and thought it was a 98 or 99 model.  It just looks very modern, about 5 &quot;style years&quot; ahead of its actual manufacture date.  The body, interior and engine were impeccable in appearance, so I was floored when I saw it had about 50,000 miles on it.  

   The styling is thoroughly modern, inside and out, and I love the roomy and very comfortable front seat layout.  I think this is, by far, the best of the Prelude body styles, with an aggressive and handsome look.  There aren't many other cars out there that I find clearly better-looking, and most of those cost at least twice as much as the $14000 I paid for mine.

   The car runs like a top.  I have had only one problem, when a heat shield near the left rear wheel became loose.  It was quickly remedied at very low cost.  I perform standard maintenance on the car, including requisite fluid changes and inspections; in return, the car provides complete driving pleasure.  I have at times spent 12 consecutive hours driving the car, stopping only for gas and fast food, and the driver's seat was still comfortable when I stopped for the night.

   The car corners like a dream, with very minimal body roll.  Hard lefts on a good road surface will have you clinging to the wheel for dear life trying to stay in your seat, because it's very difficult to get the tires to release their grip on the road.  (This is a good thing.)  The lateral G's you can pull are very impressive, due in no small part to the car's low and wide stance.  While I would love to out-accelerate a Mustang GT on the road, that won't happen in my car.  However, the car is pretty fast off the line and you can quickly get yourself out of trouble, or into trouble, depending on your preference.  Even at highway speeds, a downshift consistently buys enough power to get you out of a truck's blind spot, away from a tailgater, or out of swerving range of the cellphone user in the car next to you.  I am pleased with the car's acceleration at any reasonable driving speed, and the ample brakes have saved me from a couple of accidents when animals or errant trucks entered my lane unexpectedly.

   The cons of this car are of low consequence to me, personally.  Since I almost never have a need to drive more people around than my girlfriend and myself, I am not at all bothered by the teeny rear seats.  I am tall enough, at 6'-4&quot;, that I put the driver's seat back all the way to drive.  That means the back of my seat is actually touching the front of the seat behind me, and there is no way a passenger could sit behind me.  But for me, that is pretty much never a problem.  If you have a need to drive 3 or 4 people around, this will be a big problem.  The payoff for tiny rear seats is very comforable front seats, which even fit 200-pound guys like me when you get them adjusted properly.  If I was an inch taller, I probably would be mildly uncomfortable in a Prelude.

   Another con is the need to sit DOWN to get in.  The car is low, so you really have to pay attention when you get in and out.  For me, this is no more a problem with Preludes than with any other small to mid-sized car, since I have to do a lot of self-folding to get into any of them.  But if you're used to effortlessly sliding into your Accord, the Prelude will be notably different.  Getting out is usually more complex, since you don't have the gravity assist.

   If driving a manual transmission frightens you, the Prelude will not brighten your day.  It demands precise shifting, and is less forgiving than pretty much any other car I have driven.  It is not terribly difficult, however -- I had the hang of it halfway through my test drive at the car lot, and I hadn't driven stick for a long time before that day.  

   Storage space is adequate for a graduate student like me, and I've used it to haul a decent volume of groceries, laundry for two, et cetera without much of a problem.  The trunk is roomier than you might expect, but it's no Buick so you won't get those dining room chairs or that new 25&quot; TV to fit.  There is a small pass-through door from the trunk to the rear seat, and I've used it to get some six-foot pieces of lumber into the car when necessary.

   If you have a family and frequently drive them to school, soccer, carpools, etc., I don't think I'd recommend this car to you.  But if you're in a stage of your life that allows you to make use of a vehicle that's slightly less practical and considerably more fun to drive, I would wholeheartedly recommend a Prelude.  The 95-era body style is still very attractive and turns heads.  (Until now, I've never driven a car that gets frequent compliments.  I'm still getting used to that aspect of Prelude ownership.)  They're inexpensive, they get better mileage than most cars in their performance range, and I'm not at all worried about the previous mileage on my car because Honda has a reputation for building cars that run for a long time.  I look forward to driving this one for many years.<br><br>
