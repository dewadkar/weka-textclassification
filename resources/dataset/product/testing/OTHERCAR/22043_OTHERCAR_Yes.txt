            When it came time to upgrade my digital camera, I went on a quest. Well more like a adventure in online comparison shopping.  I settled on KODAK brand because my neighbor had one (the 200) and it took some impressive pictures. 

This digital camera was about oh, 50 dollars more than I wanted to spend. After rationalizing it away (you know, the family can eat off-brand, and I can cut down on Venti Latte's for a month)I went ahead and got it. It is AWESOME! AND....I love it.

I ripped open the box, and got right down to it.....

<b> Box Claims - My Results and Thoughts </b>

The <b> DC215 Zoom Digital Camera </b> I purchased from outpost arrived the next day. First things first, I read the outside before opening. It toots it's horn by saying :

<i> Incredible Pictures, Incredibly Easy </i> Taking pictures was really easy. I simply inserted the batteries (included) and the compact flash (into the slot on the left side of the camera). Turn it on by sliding the grooved button right. Once it is on it prompts you to set time and date. Bam now you are ready to take pictures. Built in flash can be set to automatic or manual. This comes in handy as shiny surfaces tend to white out.

<i> 2x Optical Glass Zoom Lens </i> Does come in handy somewhat. While it does capture images that otherwise would be blurs, it doesn't really do a good job. If you want to take far away pictures this isn't the camera for you. It takes pictures across the street fine, but four houses down no. To use the zoom press the tulip button on the top of the camera, and adjust the zoom by pressing the switch (located next to the power button) either left to right.

<i> Photo Realistic 5x7 Pictures </i> This is true, and the pictures do look great. Only one picture was blurry , seems that if you move even slightly the cam doesn't like it very much. I snapped a few pictures and went to download them soon after. In order to print photo realistic, bear in mind you need a somewhat decent printer as well. 

<i> Picture Resolution </i> either 640x480 for standard or 1152x864 on high resolution. There is one slight peeve here, it does take a while between picture snapping for the camera to be ready. This does annoy me when I am trying to capture a moment but have to scream 'Wait can we do it again, I missed it...wait...wait...ok I'm ready now...'

<i> Pocket Size Zoom Camera </i> fits perfectly in your hand or bag when traveling. It is lightweight as well, and comes with a cord that not only aids in carrying but keeps the lens cover secure.

<i> Easy To Be Creative </i> The software included makes it easy to cut, crop paste and add borders to pictures. I found this to be really easy to learn, and there are extremely helpful menu's in case you get overwhelmed.

<i> 4 MB Compact Flash </i> is perfect for someone wanting to take a few pictures casually. However if you are going on vacation, or want to chronicle a holiday you will need to upgrade the compact flash. In high resolution cases the 4 megs only holds a handful if not slightly more.

<i> New Metal Design </i> was I admit one of the reasons I bought the camera. It is gold (also comes in silver) and it stands out. I thought it was very attractive and eye pleasing.

<b> Software </b>

The software included is functional for some, not for me. If you want to go all out in editing and creativity you might want to upgrade, or seek another graphics program. But, included in with the camera is :

<i> Kodak Software </i> that has all the camera functions, and info on it. For instance you can clear the camera of pictures, change resolution, zoom, or any other feature you might want to default to.

<i> Adobe Software </i> contains Photo Deluxe the image editing program. You can edit your pictures by adjusting the color, brightness and a host of many other enhancements. This software also doubles as the middleman for downloading. You use it to tell the camera to retrieve the pictures, then store them on your computer.

<i> Cables </i> included are the serial and video cable. One for hooking to the back of your PC to retrieve photos and send commands to the camera and one for hooking to other devices for slideshows etc.

<i> Manuals &amp; Guides </i> that I never read all the way, though I probably should. They contain warranty information, trouble shooting, and various other information.

<b> My Closing Thoughts </b>

At the time this was a good camera boasting 1 megapixel. While there are other better cameras out there, this suited me at the time. 
Two suggestions I do make is to opt for rechargeable batteries, and a bigger flash memory card (the one that came with it is 4 megs). The batteries that came with the camera lasted all of 20 minutes. With the rechargeable batteries and bigger flash memory card I now am extremely happy with my camera. <br><br>
