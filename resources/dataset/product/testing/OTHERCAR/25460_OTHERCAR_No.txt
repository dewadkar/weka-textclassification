I purchased this vehicle brand new based on the excellent experience I had with my old Saturn which I also purchased new in 1992 and,today 267,000 miles later still runs as the day I drove off the dealership,everything is still original, including the clutch, except tires, brakes regular oil changes and a couple of tune-ups nothing else has ever needed replacement or given any problems at all.
Unfortunately, it was with the purchase of this new Saturn that I learned quite soon that their manufacturing and dealership prestige and quality  went down the drain quite fast.
Soon after driving the car a few weeks it started to develop small but very annoying problems....the power windows always worked fine until I would stop at a toll booth or the gas station and needed them to roll down,press the switch...nothing!!!try again half hour later...everything's working great,   the techs at the dealer never found or even could duplicate the problem.
I usually kept it garaged, but if I would park on the driveway for some time, and come night time would move the car in the garage, the next morning it will not start(happened just about every time)would just crank.
Saturn tech support tought me a trick that worked and I used everytime after which consisted of opening the fuse box and swapping the #1 relay with the #4 relay(something like that)that got the car started fine.....but who wants that hustle early in the AM when you're already running late for work!.
To make a long story short, the event that banged the last nail in the coffin was when at about 30,000 miles it developed a bad vibration when braking, and I mean so bad that it would knock anybodys false teeth off their mouths, took another ride to the dealer,found severely warped front rotors, not worried at first thinking it would be covered under the 36,000 mile warranty (I worked for Toyota many years and rotors were and still are covered by their warranty)but...not Saturn,their rotors are not covered I was told by a totally incompetent service clerk at the dealership,the labor n parts estimate.....$ 362.00.
me n my wife both left in despair and drove straight into a different car brand dealership and traded it in......and Saturn will NEVER see me or any of my friends in any of their dealers ever.
Never got any of their &quot;customer satisfaction&quot; reviews questionnaires every 3 months or so as I did with my old Saturn,never got any &quot;how did we perform?&quot; questionnaire from the dealership after each  of my many trips as I did with the older Saturn...in conclusion, they didnt care anymore,the &quot;different kind of car&quot; was no longer different and the &quot;different&quot; Saturn dealers are no longer different....you will be treated as if they want to grab your money and run! <br><br>
