            I have always envied people who had Suburbans.  I wanted one so very badly and knew I would never be able to afford one.  When we decided to trade our yucky Ford Windstar van in for another vehicle and cut the losses on the 3 year lease vehicle we had for only one year, I figured I would not find what I really wanted at a good price.

This vehicle we purchased was from an auction.  The Nissan dealer asked us what we wanted and to the T we described it.  Low and behold the buyer for Nissan's used vehicles purchased it the very day we &quot;placed our order&quot;.  He didn't even know it was what we were looking for.  

It was a match made in heaven.  Not even let go on the lot...not even driving it we bought it.  I could not wait to drive this all black fully loaded machine off the lot.  Immediately I fell in love with the way it handled.  Oh and the room!  I had 8 kids and two adults in the vehicle for Halloween.  Oh what a wonderful treat!  Just what I wanted...all the kids and lots of room still!  When you shut the doors you can hear how sturdy the metal is...solid as a rock!

The seats are very cushiony and comfortable.  The driver side has all sorts of adjustments.  I love the rear controls access from front and back.  The rearview mirror has a automatic dimmer in it to diminish bright lights.  It is tough, sturdy and very roomy.  People are forever looking at the piece of art and making remarks about how much it must have cost.  Little do they know it was cheaper than our mini-van.  I love all the storage compartments as well.  It is so easy to place a TV into the vehicle for the kids entertainment.

I love the room in the trunk area.  I have placed so much in this vehicle for travel, fun or work it has always fit the bill.  Now I know why I wanted one so badly.  I believe I have grown to love this bad boy machine more everyday.  I can't wait to get it out in the snow and play!<br><br>
