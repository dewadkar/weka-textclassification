            **WARNING** - The fuel sending unit that controls the fuel gauge (thus telling you how much gas you have) doesn't work in this car.  They did a recall in 1996, but mine broke again and left my wife on the interstate with no gas (even though the gauge said it had over 1/4 of a tank).  I wrote to Chrysler Customer Care and they requested that I send the receipts from the work to them - I am hoping that they will pay for the tow truck, the tests, and the new unit (totaling about $300).

I purchased my Neon Sport (2 dr, 2.0 DOHC) in November of 1994 when the first 1995 Neons came to Indiana.  I was sold on its quickness (fast) and price tag ($13,000) right away - even though I came there to buy an Eagle Talon.

I still love it's speed and enjoy putting this car where I cannot put my Jeep on the roads in DC.  The 5-speed stick is a bit sticky at times, but overall it has done well.  The car is also very loud - even when in 5th gear going 65 on the highway.  I HATE the huge blindspots in the back corners where the windows are small.

Driving the Neon is really like driving a racecar - you are low to the ground and in controll of a quick machine.  The car also sports the most headroom in its class (a must have for folks over 5-10).

This car is perfect for young single people - since the back seat is a penalty box.  I is OK on fuel performance and mine has stayed out of the shop for the most part.<br><br>
