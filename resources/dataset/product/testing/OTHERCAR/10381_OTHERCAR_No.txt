            We were getting ready to have a baby and we had 2 cars but both were 2 doors.  We went looking and we test drove the Kia.  I loved it.  I told my husband I wanted it.  The car had 4 door and plenty of room for a carseat.  I have had the car for a few months now and LOVE it.  It drives smoothly and does not eat gas.  Another thing is they are totally affordable.  One of the features I like best is the car will not go into gear from park unless you put on the break first.  It is so when you leave the car in park and say go to the mailbox, your child will not run into it and move the car.  Overall I am totally happy with my car.<br><br>
