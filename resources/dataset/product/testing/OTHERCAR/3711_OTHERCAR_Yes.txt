            I purchased a 2000 Chevrolet Silverado LT 4x4 Z-71 Extended Cab back in September.  It has been a wonderful truck so far, because of the quality and the ergonomics of the truck.  There are few things I dislike about the truck, just because it is like a luxury truck, including things like heated leather interior, cd and cassette in the dash.  It has everything down to heated mirrors and the temperature gauge for the outside and directional guidance.  This is one nice truck that is worth the money, I can see why it was Motor Trend's truck of the year in 1999.

The few things that the truck lacks are a locking rear tailgate, a fourth door for the extended cab, (the current ones have 3 doors), but there is good news that I've heard from the dealership.  The news is that they are coming out with a fourth door in the spring, so there go's that complaint.  The only other real complaint I have is that I can't drive it enough, and that payment that I make every month on this, it is a wonderful truck.

I have towed a 21 1/2 foot boat with it as well, without any problems whatsoever, (leaving it in 2wd), and have had to climb mountains towing it behind me, so I have tested it's towing abilities to that extent.  The one thing I haven't really tried is taking it off-road, because I have a problem taking a $34,000 truck off-road, when I have no need to.  

I love most everything about this truck including the exterior design, interior appearance and feel, as well as the instrument gauge, one drive in this truck and you will have to own it, the only problem is affording it's gas, since the 5.3 liter motor gets 15/18 miles per gallon.  The power is unbelievable though, with 270 horsepower and 315 torque, there is ample power for most anyone.  

I am not sure of the statistics of the competition, but I drove and compared this truck to the Dodge Ram, Toyota Tundra, Ford F-150, and the GMC Sierra 1500, and the only other one I would've considered, but really didn't was the GMC.  The sales practices from GMC made it difficult to deal with them, and I liked the appearance of the Chevrolet better.  The GMC and the Chevy are basically the same truck other than appearance as far as I could tell.  As for the rest, the power wasn't as good, with comparable gas mileage, and comfort was best on the Chevy/GMC.  The appearance was a big factor as well, but not the sole one.  I did compare, and shopped around for 3 months and by far I believe the Chevy is the best deal with the most comfort around for the money.



UPDATE:

6/7/00
I have now owned the truck for about 8 months and 13,000 miles.  The truck is still holding up as if I drove it off of the showroom floor.  The off-road capabilities are wonderful and the ride is not compromised at with the off road package.  I took it down into the hills of KY in the winter, and the truck perfomed way beyond my expectations; I honestly felt like I could've taken it anywhere I wanted to go. I am pleased with every aspect of the truck.  I took it to Florida, a 3000 mile road trip, and the ride was great, comfortable, even for the people that rode in the extended cab.  Everyone had ample stretching and leg room.  Chevrolet has answered my main problem of the truck not having 4 doors, because all of the models built now have 4 doors.  I'm sure that if Chevrolet keeps this up, they will ave satisfied customers, and one in particular... me. I am averaging about 16 mpg in the city, and I got about 20 on the interstate on the way to florida, so I'm fairly happy with that, considering the sticker said I would get 15 and 18.  I hope to have the same kind of updates in the future, but only time will tell, but as of now, I'm a pleased customer.  My neighbor liked my truck so much, he went out and bought one last week, LS model though, even the same color (which I could've done without).

UPDATE: 11/10/00

I have had this truck for approximately 20,000 miles now, and it has not been in the shop yet, so this has been a wonderful truck and only costing me for the scheduled maintance.  I take it camping all the time, and there is nothing I think it can't do.  It seems to go anywhere i need it to, without any slippage or hesitation, and the 6 1/2 ft. bed has proven to be a good choice for me, because I have never needed anymore space than that as of yet.  With the winter months about here now, I'll be able to test its abilities on the snow again, especially since I didn't get to do that much last winter due to there not being much of it on the ground.  So to summarize this truck is a definate A++ and I recommend it to everyone that asks about it, and even had a few people try to buy it from me.... so I really love it!

UPDATE - 9/10/02:

The truck now has about 50,000 miles on it, so I have had it for 3 years now.  The best way to say it is, I hope I have the same pleasure, luck, and feeling with any vehicles i buy in the future as I have had with this one.  This has been just a great truck, and only been in the shop once at 34,000 miles when there was a recall that they had fixed (something to do with the break pedal.)  The dealership did an overall inspection of the vehicle as well due to it being around 36,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty.  The people at the dealership found a spot in the seam (that was about to be a problem) of my leather seats, and replaced that under the warranty.  Other than that it has been with me the whole time.  I have taken the truck off-road many times now as well as I have gotten more comfortable with it.  The Goodyear AT's hold up great, and take me wherever I have wanted to go without ever getting stuck in the mud!  I am about to replace them though (with the same type), they still have about 1/5 inch of tread left or so, but my off-road driving habits demand a little more, and I do not feel like getting stuck.
