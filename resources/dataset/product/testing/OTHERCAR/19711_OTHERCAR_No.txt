            Shopping around for a small wagon in 1999, there was not a lot of choice. Subaru Impreza - too expensive; Escort - depreciates too fast; Hyundai - think &quot;Pony&quot;. That left me with the Saturn SW. I chose the SW2 to get the bigger engine, and went with auto-stick because of Vancouver's ever increasing traffic congestion. Once you cut through all the Hype and have lived with this car you learn that it's just an average car with a balance of Pros and Cons. Let's start with the Cons. The seats are uncomfortable all around, very much so in the back. The seating position is cramped for 6 footers both front and especially back. The heating control's ergonomics are poor.  The shock towers intrude the hatch and gobble up storage space. Engine is harsh and noisy. Storage pockets are sparse and tiny. The car lacks a sporty handling feel (but, it is, after all, only a station wagon) although that could be tuned with performance tires and shocks.
The Pros are: Strong engine, despite the racket/vibes and tied to auto-stick. Fairly solid feel on the road. Strong brakes. Good heating and ventilation; Tranny shifts smoothly even under hard acceleration. Doors don't dent (more on that later). Clear instrument cluster. Surprisingly good stereo for a standard model. 
These pros and cons are the kind of things I've come to expect from an American car.  I had previously owned and driven Hondas and Acuras.  Saturn pales miserably in comparison. Fit &amp; finish, performance and handling, ergonomics and roominess - all subpar when beside the Honda family (or Toyota, or Mazda).  But, I knew I wasn't buying a Honda, so I'm not overly disappointed.  I've had no mechanical troubles after 30K, just minor wheel alignment/tire balance issues.
One last thing: about those plastic panels that clad the doors and quarter panels.  Yes, they are dent resistant, but don't think they are damage resistant.  People have still managed to make permanent marks on my front bumper and drivers doors in parking lots.  If you want to keep your Saturn shiny and new, keep away from the long-door-Lincoln morons and any big-pickup-bumper-buffoons.
Just remember; forget the hype- Just digest what I've written, live with the car, and come to your own conclusions.<br><br>
