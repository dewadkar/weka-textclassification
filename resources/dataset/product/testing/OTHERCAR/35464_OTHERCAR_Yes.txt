            I've used  a number of digital cameras, but always went for the 35mm (Canon EOS Elan 7) when quality was an issue. We still use it once in a while, but not very often.  We have two small children at home, and my wife was burning through film at a rate of about 2-3 rolls a week. That, plus developing (incl. dbl print, enlargements, etc...) was costing a fortune. Storage was becoming an issue too.

Then I saw the 707! My eyes glazed over and I ran home to research it.  I went back to the store a few days later and bought it.  It was probably the best electronics purchase I've ever made.  

My wife can now take as many pics as she wants.  In the first ten weeks of owning it, we've already taken about 1500 shots.  Quality is virtually no longer an issue with the 5 megapixel quality this unit has. 

Memory Stick is the easiest storage media I've come across.  Easy to use, and easier to carry with you when traveling.  I've purchased two 128M and two 64M MS which gives us about 240 shots in 'fine' quality.  We keep it set one level down from best quality for most of what we do.  The extra memory comes in handy when we're not near our PC.  

Sony made it SO easy to transfer the pics to the PC and its so easy to view them, that we keep all of them (except for the really bad ones).  We catalog them according to date (as we transfer them) and just burn a group of dates to a CD and date the disk. Voila!  If we want prints, we use one of the many services out there (Ofoto, Snapfish, Shutterfly, etc...).  Very inexpensive and we've never been disappointed by only buying prints of good shots.  

Back to the camera.  We're used to the size of a 35mm SLR, so the 707 is a dream.  Big enough to get your hands around, but smaller and lighter than our Elan.  The battery has never run out on us once (just remember to plug it in when its low).  We've gone through all four MSs (close to 300 shots, saving 240+ pics) on a single charge with room to spare!  The (shutter) delay is minimal, compared to other digitals we've used, and the '3 shot burst' feature has given us some incredible shots.  Focuses great, even in low light, and  the 'viewfinder or LCD' option for viewing is fantastic.
