            While not acually owning this vehicle i have ridden enough times with it and read numerous articles on it as well as done research in the SUV market.  So bear with me.  I am very critical of the SUV market so j**p isn't the only one i bash or praise..  

Simply put this vehicle is one of the finer vehicles Jeep has built.  It will go just about anywhere with some effort.  First off it is designed to cope with the road travel a little to nicely.  It doesn't lack too much on the road, but it does suffer off road due to that fact.

Key elements to a successful 4wheel drive include; Soft yet durable suspension, lack of horsepower and adequate torque, ground clearance, gearing, and endurance.  

The cherokee is found lacking in many of these categories, but does perform well off road.  Certainly one of the finer vehicles jeep has put out for the weekend off roader.  It suffers from a tight suspension that does not allow good suspension flow.  alot of times you'll end up on three wheels and the way a differential works you're not going keep moving the way you want to.

one thing drivers will notice is the smooth acceleration on this vehicle.  heck who needs a car when your jeep can 0-60 it this fast!  that does present a problem off road.  in many of the grueling challenges one will face off road you need a vehicle that converts horsepower to torque at very low speeds and low RPMs.  otherwise you're going to break something or stress the engine for long periods of time.  

the jeep does however have excellent ground clearance at 8.3 inches, thats enough to clear most obstacles and enough torque to take it to the next century at 225lbs.  the vehicles weight comes in at about 3000 lbs.  it has a decent torque weight ratio for 4wheeling although the horsepower tends to interfere.

Endurance is another factor though.  i'd like to point out that the jeep has ample endurance for a weekend exursion which is probably more than many of us will do..  but when it comes down to it would it stand up to the test of something like Camel Trophy? or even keeping up with a Land Rover of any age and model?  due to the tons of horsepower and lots of torque mix you'll go through U-joints very rapidly.  Do pack an extra couple with you as you will need them after off roading for more than a couple of hours or so.  that is one thing that does urke me..  the vehicle is fine and dandy until you put some real off road stress on it that stock rovers were designed to handle.  The jeep wasn't designed off the line to do much 4wheeling.  I don't care what they say it does on the rubicon, if you do much off roading the jeep will be in the shop sooner or later.  It doesn't come ready made out of the box as Land Rovers do.  You have to do some tweaking and lifting before you're not going to break something in a jeep cherokee.

Lets be realistic though, Cherokee is one of the few SUVs that does make sense to buy.  Its on road/off road abilities are distributed for the Average American in mind.  Land Rover can have the rough road, but how many of us spend a Rover's amount of time off road?  Jeep is the clear choice for a level headed chap in the SUV market that desires a vehicle with good road performance and some off road abilities as well for those weekend excursions.
