            I purchased this SUV well before the SUV craze, but it is vehicles like this one that helped create the markets' strong demand.  The Landcruiser will run circles around it's contemporary competition the Range Rover, and the rest are not even in it's class.
First let's talk about the things you won't like.  Gas mileage is the number one draw-back (like most &quot;real&quot; SUV's), don't expect to do any better than 12-14 miles to a gallon.  However, it does have a 25 gallon tank which helps extend time between the pump and it will run without knocking on regular gas.
You also will have a little sticker shock..even used the Landcruisers hold their value very well.  If you are selling one that's great, if you are buying, be prepared to pay more than you would think reasonable for a 6 year old vehicle.
Finally, if you know cars well you will recognize that this transmission sometimes does not shift smoothly into 2nd gear.  You may feel a solid bump as it does.
Those are the only negatives you will probably find on this SUV!  Now let's talk about why you will love it!
Certainly there are all the traditional SUV values here...nice high ride, solid feel of a 5,000 lb vehicle, and the ability to drive over most terrain.  But the Landcruiser does things that most 4-wheel drive SUVs won't, and this is why I put it into a class of its own.  
It has full-time four wheel drive (partially explaining the gas mileage) which provides extra security both on and off road.  Driving in the rain or snow with full-time four wheel drive inspires much more confidence.  What is amazing is that despite the four wheel drive, it has a remarkable turning radius, I would stack it up against any two wheel drive SUV and beat them in a tight turn.
Reliability is another winner.  My neighbor works for Toyota in their industrial equipment division and he indicated that this big 6 cylinder engine has been used in Toyota industrial equipment for over 30 years.  Make no mistake, these engines are built to reliably go 250,000 miles or more (starting to justify the cost?).  I regularly change the oil and service the vehicle, and have never had an occasion to put it in the shop other than than these usual service items.
Inside there is room for all and Toyota figured out a clever way to install a rear bench seat that folds out of the way when not in use.  You could carry the whole brownie or boy scout troop yourself and not sacrifice looks or performance by using the popular (but unattractive) mini-van.  The rear seats also fold up quickly and easily and suddenly you have the cargo capacity of a mini-van.
This Landcruiser is the total package, you can't go wrong if you want style, reliability, and functionality in your SUV!
