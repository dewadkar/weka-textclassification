            the 1992 honda accord is a very solid car.  The stick shift gets great mileage, the interior is stylish and roomy (for a non-luxury car), and it handles like a dream.

my contact with such a fine automobile is that my girlfriend has one and she drives me places all the time.  I drive it too, occasionally.  Ypou dont have to be as hard on the stick as you do in my car (toyota corollla) and it is altogether a smoother ride than most other cars.  The trunk space is ample as well.  the tape deck hasnt let me down either.  I play my music in her stereo all te time (heh heh)

If you can get one for a decent price, i reccomend it.  It is a very quality car that you can depend on and just feels good to drive.
