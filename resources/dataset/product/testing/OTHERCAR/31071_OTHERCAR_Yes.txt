            Pros:
I purchased my Toyota Tundra in September, 1999 and as far as full-size trucks go, this is the best I've ever owned.  I have owned a 1995 full size regular cab Chevrolet pickup, a 1997 full size extended cab Chevrolet C1500, and a 1999 Club Cab Chevrolet C3500 (which I traded for the Tundra).  All three developed interior rattles within the first 3 months.  All three were returned for warranty service within the first month of ownership.  These problems varied in nature but the point is this...I've owned the Tundra for 3 months and the only problem that I've experienced is a weak battery in the door remote control.  The truck is extremely quite inside, fit and finish are excellent, power from the V-8 engine sets a new standard for truck acceleration and towing power. The driving experience is excellent. The truck handles as well as any European sedan.  My overall experience with my Tundra has been excellent and I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase.  

Cons:
Rear seat room is somewhat cramped and the gas mileage is less than I would have expected from a Toyota.  But hey, there are tradeoffs, I'll take power over fuel economy, (13 mpg city, 18-22 mpg highway.  <br><br>
