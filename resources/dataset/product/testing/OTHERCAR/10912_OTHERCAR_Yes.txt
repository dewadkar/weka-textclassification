            Here's an update for everyone who might have read my earlier epinion (<a href='/./auto-review-2EE8-916B28A-3822204B-bd1'>http://www.epinions.com/./auto-review-2EE8-916B28A-3822204B-bd1</a>), &quot;The 2000 328 Ci Coupe&quot;

First off, I ran into several problems, mostly minor, and fortunately, not frequent.

1. After about 4K miles, occasionally the engine would have problems starting. It didn't really correlate to hot or cold days, or anything else I could figure out. This has happened about a dozen times or so. The BMW service technician suggested my foot may have been brushing up against the gas pedal as I got inside the car, flooding the engine slightly.

2. Sun roof issues: the open/close button is supposed to be &quot;one touch&quot;; meaning, you don't have to hold it down to operate the roof. However, at times, the glass would close about 3/4 of the way and then stop. I would have to open the roof all the way, then hold down the button until it finally closed. The technician claimed that it was a common problem and first said that they would lubricate the seal. However, they ended up replacing the entire sunroof because it turned out there was a slight defect in the way the glass was set in the roof.

3. &quot;Key-less&quot; entry: using my keychain, I am supposed to be able to unlock both driver and passenger door by a double-tap action. Once in a while, the second tap does not do anything, forcing me to open the passenger door manually from inside. The technician ran some tests was not able to identify the culprit.

What makes these issues bearable is the superb handling of the car. Cruising up San Francisco hills and pulling tight turns is a fun experience. The  mileage is decent considering the amount of hills and stop and go traffic I contend with daily (and the current price per gallon!). The leather seats, 12 speaker sound system, and great air/heating system raise the comfort and enjoyment level to new heights. Also, the amount of maintenance required is very minimal. I just passed the 11,500 mile mark and the car's &quot;maintenance meter&quot; advises that I take the car in for its first oil change.

My gut feeling about the car's troubles is that it was an early showroom model (I purchased it November 1999) that perhaps the factory rushed to meet some delivery deadline. I find it ironic considering the video I received emphasized the manufacturer's commitment to quality (and the amount of testing they supposedly do at the BMW factory).

On a side-note, this car drives poorly in winter conditions. I managed to get up to Lake Tahoe a few times, even using chains in a few situations on the way out. With chains on, you cannot use the dynamic stability control feature, so the car was sliding at times. BMW is now producing the 330xi which is all-wheel drive. This is probably a better choice when anticipating driving on icey or snow-covered roads.
