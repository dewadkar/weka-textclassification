            This was my dad's vehicle. I drive it around alot. It drives really smooth and gauges are easy to read and well lit at night. When we first bought it new I was surprised to see that the lights inside go on when you try to open the door when it is locked. Plus at night the power window buttons light up(if equipped on your vehicle).  Some minor flaws about the vehicle that I dislike are when you sit in the back seat and you are a average sized guy your knee will hit the power window button and open the window. It has happened alot, and when we travel I normally sit in back so if it is cold outside and your asleep in the back you might want to turn on the window lock upfront. Another thing is the so called remote next to the stearing wheel for the radio. The buttons have been sticking or will not work at all lately. I have no clue why? If you do alot of highway driving you might want to check this out when you test drive one. When your speeds get high like around 70 or so the whole dashboard starts to like vibrate which is really weird. The front lights on the car do not get really bright when you turn the brights on. But even after getting into a left front side accident the car has been repaired and still drives beautiful and the best thing about it was that when my mom got hit she did not get hurt so I guess you can say it has paid for itself.<br><br>
