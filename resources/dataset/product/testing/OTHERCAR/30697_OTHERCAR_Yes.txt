            2000 Pontiac Sunfire Coupe

The original game plan was to go try out a few cars I had gotten information on from the internet. After trying out the practical, 4-door models available (as was our original game plan), I followed my eyes which kept wandering to the sporty little silver bullet at the end of the car lot. Thinking to myself that surely it was out of our price range because it was &quot;just so darn cute&quot;, I was shocked and pleased to find out that it was not only in our price range but it was MORE affordable.

I absolutely love it!  'She' is beautiful, sporty, fun to drive and easy to maneuver.  When you sit behind the wheel, you have the feeling that you're driving a much more expensive sports car, of course the electric moon roof and the CD surround sound stereo system help with this. The bucket seats are comfortable, everything is user friendly and easy to reach while driving. My first weekend with the new car, I put on 750 miles, never suffering from &quot;road trip rump&quot; or any other discomforts.  There is actually room in the back seat and the back seat folds down for additional room in the trunk. It has good acceleration and is VERY easy to find a parking space for.

The only problems that I could foresee is that a larger person wouldn't find it as comfortable.  I'm 5'7&quot; and sometimes my hairdo brushes the roof when I wear my hair up. A taller person or a larger person might find it a little claustrophobic.<br><br>
