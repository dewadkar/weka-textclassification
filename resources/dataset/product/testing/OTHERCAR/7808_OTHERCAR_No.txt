            I purchased my 1994 Saturn SC2 new. I had read good things about the car and the company itself. I expected to get a reliable, steady, and well built car. I didn't get all that I wanted. (by the way, I traded in my SC2 for a 2000 Mazda MPV. Check out my review of the MPV.)

First, the good. Driving the SC2 was a lot of fun. It was easy to maneuver and had decent pick-up for a 4 cylinder engine. You could easily zip around town and fit into almost any available parking spot. The stereo system was nice (I had only a AM/FM radio) with very good sound quality. The A/C worked very quickly and blew out a lot of air. The roadside assistance program worked (see &quot;The Bad&quot;).

For a first time buyer, the Saturn buying experience is great. But remember, you do pay full sticker price.

The bad: 

I expected my Saturn to be reliable. Well there were two occasions when my Saturn broke down and had to be towed. First the battery basically burned up and later the alternator went bad. (Just have to love AC Delco parts). This was within about the first two years. On both occasions the roadside assistance program worked well and dispatched a tow truck. The air foil under the front section of the car broke off one day on my way to work. Without it the car will overheat. I was able to put it back on with duct tape until I could get it fixed. My Saturn really had a nasty habit of burning oil. Worse was that it was almost impossible to change the oil yourself because of where the oil filter was placed. Also, the SC2 had an external transmission fluid filter--one time a mechanic mistook it for the oil filter and loosened it by mistake. This caused a leak with resulted in another trip to the repair shop.

The tires on the SC2 were very thin and easily punctured. Happened to me twice. The worst part is that these tires are specially made for the SC2 and cost about $100 each. 

The interior was all made of plastic (like many cars) and not sturdy. Several parts of the interior broke apart within the first 2 years. The ride was noisy, bumpy, and not comfortable. If you has a long ride, you got a stiff back and legs. 

The antenna kept coming lose and had to be screwed back in every couple months.

When I traded my Saturn in, it had 43,000 miles. That is not a lot for a 6 year old car, and still I had many problems. In contrast, I have a 92 Honda Civic that still runs like a dream. I really felt that the Saturn would not hold up much longer and decided to trade it in while I could still get something for it.
