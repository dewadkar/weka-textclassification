<TEXT>
            We have a 98 Villager. When we first got it, there was some transmission problems, which were corrected {twice, unfortunately!} We had owned Fords before, and they all had terrible transmissions, so we were worried, but we have had no problems with it since.
We live in a hilly area, and have no problem getting up and down, even in the snow.
The middle seats are a bit difficult to remove, but since we don't need to do this often, this is not a real problem. I wouldn't want to do it weekly or more! 
We've been able to get everything we've ever needed to into it, from lumber to furniture to soccer teams. 
The car runs well after 3 years with no major maintenance. <br><br>
