            I bought a Chevrolet Blazer because I have a family of five and I wanted a vehicle large enough to carry all of us and a vehicle that could haul things if needed.  I have an LT model with all the bells and whistles except a moon roof.  The ride is pretty smooth for a  &quot;truck&quot; and my boat is an easy tow for this vehicle.  However,some of the things that have been replaced already are:  The radiator, the heater core, the alternator, and the transmission has been rebuilt.  I feel like I'm constantly in the shop with the vehicle.  Many parts put in the car are plastic, which is a component of its failure.  I have been told this is due to government regulations for the weight of the vehicle and fuel economy.  So when a part has been replaced, it's been replaced with metal in place of plastic.  

Another problem with the interior has been break-through type holes in the two front seats.  I was told this is a common problem with the interior and I'd have to take it to an upholsterer to be redone.  A piece of carpet is put in under the leather so that these holes don't recur.  Why did Chevrolet make these seats with this potential flaw in them?  

I also find that when I drive in rain (even a drizzle that wets the road) my brakes will lock and I've had a few close calls of hydroplaning and almost rear-ending somebody.  The dealership has never been able to find the problem but I've spoken to at least two other owners who have experienced this situation.  

The car has a comfortable ride and I like the looks, but I will never buy a Chevrolet again.  <br><br>
