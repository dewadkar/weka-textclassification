            I bought a Dodge Stratus 5 years ago when they first came out and it is
the best car I have ever had. I bought this car because of it's handling
and roominess. My entire family is close to or over six feet tall. There
was no car except the Stratus that my entire family felt comfortable in.
There is not only enough leg room there is stretching room too. There
are also large pockets in the front doors that can handle anything from 
6 canned drinks to the largest of maps.
The handling on this car is incredible. It has a suspension that makes
you feel like you are driving a more expensive car. It is low to the
ground in front and hugs the curves. I can handle the sharpest curves at
higher speeds and still feel comfortable.
The spunk in this car is also great step on the pedal and it is very
hard to believe I am in a four cylinder car.
The only problem I have found with this car is my fault. The owners
manual tells you when to change the transmission fluid in this car and I
went 7,500 miles past that mileage. I ended up burning all seals from
the engine and transmission. Please buy this car but follow owners
manual better than I did.<br><br>
