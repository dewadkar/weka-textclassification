            i bought this car in 1999 when it had 106,000 miles on it. I used it on our honeymoon and it was fine. When it got around 118,000 miles on it the engine was going out and had to be replaced. It has the Ford 302 with Auto OD tranny. It is a poor combination. Lacking power all across the board. Even this new engine has been a dissapointment. With the OD on, 'stepping' into it produces nothing until the pedal is almost to the floor. It also handles funny on the highway. It makes you feel very unsure out there at times!
  The interior is fairly comfortable, although it could be better. The sound system is not the top of the line one and that is fine. The only complaint I would have with it would be that the front speakers are mounted in the doors and not the dash top where they should be. Things are laid out well. Easy to use controls.
  The body and paint are done right. I have no complaints about either of those. The Ford nameplate is not a horrible car to own just not the one for me. I would have to admit, though, that it has been a dependable car to own. It has never left me stranded.
