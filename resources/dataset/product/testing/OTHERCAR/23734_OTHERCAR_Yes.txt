            The Volkswagen Jetta is the best 4 cylinder, mid-size car on the market today for the young professional.  Everything from commuting to taking it to the mountains on a ski trip, the Jetta has it all in terms of convienence and comfort.
Quick and responsive, the Jetta always has that extra kick to pass a slow moving vehicle and the handling to deal with any type of road.  Put this all together and you get the ultimate road trip car.
A huge trunk, plenty of room for four, and the little amenities like a great sound system, cup holders and romm to put the little things makes this the enterprise of rodtrippers everywhere.  It's the little things that count, like being able to put an oversize drink into the slot below your seat to adjust the seat's position back and forth.  
Versatile and safe, the Jetta has been my car for over 12 years.  I'm on my 3rd GLS now and would recommend this German engineered car to any young professional who values style, comfort and performance without sacraficing space and the little nick-nacks we all love in our car.<br><br>
