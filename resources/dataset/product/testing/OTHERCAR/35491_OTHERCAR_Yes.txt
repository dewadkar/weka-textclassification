            I waited for three years to buy a minivan because I believed that Honda could do better than the original Honda minivan. We read the review about the new 1999 Honda Odyssey by Consumer Reports (sorry this was not available) and put in an order for the van the next week without ever getting to see one in person. We were not disappointed. I bought the EX model and I am so happy with the wonderful extras (the power remote doors, power locks and windows). It has been my dream vehicle. And of course Honda is always a reliable and worth the extra money. This van drives just like a car but fits 7 people comfortably. My opinion, do not get the bench seat in the middle. The cabin seats are much better for the people trying to get in the back seat. This van has plenty of room and the back fold down seat is very convenient. Taking out the middle seats is very easy also for those big items needing to be carried. Highly recommended!!!<br><br>
