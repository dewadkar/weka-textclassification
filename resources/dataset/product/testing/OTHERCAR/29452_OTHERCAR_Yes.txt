            I have owned my 1999 Wrangler for a year and a half now.  Most improved in this model over previous years was the reduced noise level from the soft top.  The suspension is Drastically improved with little to no chance of roll over during normal driving conditions.(Including taking turns to fast on pavement).  The Dual airbags are a plus, and I was able to push a Honda Civic stuck in snow with my front bumper with no airbag discharge.  Keep in mind when pushing the Honda out I was in four-wheel drive and was even bumping the car with my front bumper. I have the smaller stock tires and have had no problem getting out of mud, snow and even sand dunes in Northern Michigan.  Although the suspension and comfort are improved in this model it is still a utility vehicle and is not best suited for a family on long trips.  I have calculated my gas Mileage at 27 MPG on the highway.  One draw back in fueling the Wrangler is it can be difficult to completely fill.  It is possible for the gas pump to not allow anymore fuel in the tank and your indicator reads 1/8 empty. The top is very easy to bring up and down. Although this can be done with one person I found it to take me about 10 minutes to fully extend or retract it.  The optional rear roll bar speakers are a must for proper music enjoyment. If there is a strong wind it is possible you will not hear the radio with out the rear speakers.  I have found mine to be in the shop three times to have the defroster fixed.  For some reason the selector valve on the heater always got stuck directing the air to the floor, leaving the defroster disabled. My turn-signal switch was defective, but was corrected and no problems since.  They hold resale value very well, it is an excellent first off-road vehicle with many options available.  My insurance in Michigan for a 27 year old male and no tickets is $800(full coverage).  <br><br>
