            I purchased my 1995 Geo Prism as an executive model in 1996.  I was told by the dealer that it was one of the few cars that he has only had in the shop for routine maintance, never has any problems with this car or any complaints.  

I drive a minimum of 280 miles a week JUST to work, sometimes 350 miles, plus school, kids using it, several trips to Chicago and Indiana (I live in southern Illinois) and have never had any problems with it.

After 108,000 miles, I have only put on new tires and a battery.  It recently has had a new starter put on and three belts replaced.  Not bad for that many miles.

As for gas milage - 28-30+ miles to the gallon.  Not bad either.

Plus my 6 ft. plus sons and my father are fairly comfortable in the back seat.

My opinion? If you want an economical, maintaince free compact car, this is it!<br><br>
