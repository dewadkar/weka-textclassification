            Since its introduction in 1994, Dodge has steadily improved its groundbreaking Ram pickup to help it keep pace with newer and more sophisticated designs put out by the competition.   While it retains the best looks in the market segment, the Ram has slowly fallen behind in terms of driving comfort, braking, and overall refinement.  It's not a bad truck, and doesn't do anything poorly, but it's not the ultimate. Then again, it is much more affordable that some of the competition's new vehicles.

The Ram interior was revamped for 1998, with much improved cupholders, which take it from having some of the worst around to some of the best. They are huge, and can grip your drink so it won't fall out even in bumpy terrain.  Seat design and materials were also improved, as was the general interior and dash design.  

In 2000, Dodge moved to improve the Ram's handling and braking characteristics, and they succeded to a degree. There is less steering slack, wandering, and braking is stronger, with less fade.  Overall, the truck is rather superior to pre '98 models.

My overall impressions of the new RAM:

Looks:  Top notch. Especially in 4x4 SLT trim.   It's the best looking truck on the road, though it could use a sheetmetal update soon.  

Comfort/Interior:  The seats are also the best around. Big and spacious, with a great console, it doesn't even need bucket seats as an option(which isn't available).  The controls are all well marked and easy to use.   The stereo is adequate, I would recommend an aftermarket setup rather than their overpriced upgrade CD/Cassette Infiniti setup.  Rear seating is not as good as the GM Silverado/Sierra, but it's adequate and the Ram is better looking inside.

Performance/handling: Never a strong point for a truck, this is probably where the Ram shows it's age the most.  Though steering feel is improved, it still isn't as carlike as the competition.   They have however, fixed the Ram's tendency to wander on the road.  Braking is adequate, though still worst-in-class.  Despite the &quot;sport&quot; models they sell, this is not a sport truck.  Engine power is fine, especially with the 5.9L V-8, but it is coarse and noisy compared to the competion's models.  These are 70's design engines that have been modernized over the years.  Totally new engines will accompany the new Ram in '03, I believe.  On-road ride is smooth, but tire noise is evident and you should drive a Toyota Tundra for an example of how quiet a pickup can actually be.   But absent that, you aren't really bothered by the noise.  

Reliability: Dodge continues to have major problems with their transmissions, though engines seem rock solid.  Be sure you have a quality dealer service department nearby before buying, because you probably will be in for warranty work.  My brother's Ram required a full week in the shop  for a transmission rebuild at 35,000 miles.   My Ram was in 3 times in three years, and required a rebuilt overdrive unit among other repairs.   The 1500 series Ram is not a good choice for towing or hauling.   Try a model with a tougher auto transmission, or a manual.  Service departments have run from good to terrible here, so ask around before buying.

Other:  The paint jobs are about average for American trucks.  You won't be in show condition after 5 years, but you probably won't have peeling paint either.   The black tends to dull quickly.  Visability is good, with the Ram's large greenhouse.   Just be careful not to back over a Subaru.  Fuel mileage is a weak point, with my 5.9L V-8 4x4 acheiving only 13 mpg around town.   (my Tundra gets about 17 mpg, but it is a 2wd model)

All in all, the Ram is a decent truck, especially if you don't care so much about a quiet, soft, smooth ride or sporty performance.   With the recent improvements, rebates and heavy discounts, it's a great value new.
I would avoid used models, especially since they do have a history of transmission problems.  A well equipped extended cab 4x4 can be had for $24,000 if you find the right discounts and buy from a high-volume dealer.
Chevys, GMC's, Fords, and Toyotas do cost a little more.

HINT:  Business owners can join their local farm bureau and get an additional $500 rebate(check for details)


Overall, the Ram is no longer my first choice, but it is tops in comfort, looks, and regular cab spaciousness.   They also have great resale value, which makes them a very affordable vehicle to own.
