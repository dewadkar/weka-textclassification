            I got my Accord about 2 weeks ago, and I love it. It has a bigger engine than I used to have, so the power is really nice. The ride is smooth, and I never bumpy. I have the 4 door, and it is very spacious. There is plenty of room for me, my school stuff, and any passengers. 

I have the EX-V6-L model, which comes with leather seats, V-6 engine, moon roof, six speaker CD player,front driver,passenger, and side air bags, keyless entry, and an anti theft system. I feel very safe driving this car, and I love the look of it. It is sporty, but spacious at the same time. 

My parents bought an Accord in 1999, and they love it. That is why I got one. It is my early graduation present. My dad knew that I would be safe in this car. I would recommend this car to anyone. It great for someone in college, as well as someone with a family. The Gas mileage is great. I went over 200 miles around town before having to fill up again.

The Honda web site is outstanding, and you can customize your car, and also get a price quote. It will also hook you up with the Honda dealer near you.
