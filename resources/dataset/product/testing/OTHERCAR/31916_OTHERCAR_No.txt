                 When I test drove the car in February the check engine light was on.  I liked the car but did not want it because of this.  The salesman kept calling and calling.  He told me the car had just come in and had not been checked.  He promised me it was fixed and the car was fine.  After 18 days of this, I gave in and went back to buy the car.
     On February 29 I signed the papers and went to take the car.  Before I left the lot the engine light was still on.  I told the salesman and left, not taking the car, it sat for another 18 days.  At this time I did not want the car, there was something wrong with it.  
     Then the salesman again started calling and calling.  He was threatening me telling me it was too late it was mine and I had no choice but to take it.  He also promised it was fixed. This went on for about another month.  With all his threatening me, how it was my car and
they would sue me, I would have to pay for it anyway, my credit would be ruined etc.  I again went to get it and before I left the lot the engine light came on again.  
     We took it to the service dept. they checked it and said it was just a sensor.  He said the part was backordered but he reset it and it was OK now �there really was nothing wrong.� I took the car.  Then a couple of days later the light came on again and I took it back and left it there for a couple of days again and they said they replaced the sensor.  
     Finally they called and said it was fixed, and I again picked up the car.  A couple of days later the engine light came on again.  I took it back it was there again for a couple of weeks and they said the gas cap was loose and reset it.  This was in April.
     Then I was on the Parkway at the speed limit of 65 mph the engine light came on and the car started shaking and the engine stopped.  When the engine stopped there was no steering or brakes, the car started spinning.  I could not steer the car and it spun around, it was severely damaged Almost $ 8,000.00, and took over a month to fix.  The body shop
also said the air bag had malfunctioned.  In an accident that severe it should have gone off, it didn�t.  The body shop man also said there was something wrong with it because it stalled when he was moving it in the shop.
     Then I picked the car up from the body shop, on August 1.  After a couple of blocks the engine shut off again.  I got out of the car had it towed to Kerbeck Subaru where it is now.  The sales man now says he is waiting for some guy at Subaru to get back to him. 
After over a month, I canceled the insurance, and when I went to remove my personal belongings and license plates the car was still all apart in their yard.  
     It was obvious they could not fix it.  After paying the $500.00 deductible for damage caused by the vehicle malfunction, then having to pay for towing.  I have decided to cut my losses.  I stopped making payments, and informed the loan company as to the location and
condition of the car.  Now the loan company (Subaru Credit), says I have to get this 'brand new' car running so they can reposes it. After this many trips to the dealer it is obvious this car is not able to
be fixed.  The first accident almost killed me, I am afraid for my life to get in this car.  My credit may be ruined, but at least I am alive.  This brand new car has been sitting at the dealership for three months all apart, with the parts piled on the seat.  
I would not recommend a Subaru to anyone.<br><br>
