            Around mid 1999 I was getting tired of my 91 Suburban and decided to go car shopping. One of my aunts works at a Lincoln Ford Dealer and I was able to trade in my Burby for a brand new red gleaming 99 Navigator.  I was already in love with it before I tested it.  It didnt take much to convince me to buy, but little did I know that this car would one day save my life.  About six months later as I was picking up a tux at a local rental shop near my house I got into a potentially serious car accident.  As the car that had cut in front of me from a side road  stood there in my path, I quickly slammed the brakes but I knew that I could not stop this or any other car going at 45mph within a distance of thirty feet. All I have to say is the antilock brakes worked their magic.  When I finally hit the Ford Bronco on its driver side, not only did I not kill the young eighteen year old driver, but I came out without a scratch.  The front of my precious vehicle was damaged, but it was nothing that could not be fixed.  Its been almost a year since the accident and my Navigator drives as if nothing had ever happen to it.  I definately recommend this vehicle for its safety features and its durability.  Some definate quality work must have been put in it for it to be such a road worthy vehicle.  If you can afford a luxury vehicle and you want safety and durability, you can already guess what I'm going to say, &quot;Buy a Navigator&quot;<br><br>
