            This is my first Subaru.  I was aware of the devoted owners before I bought this car in October 2000, and after one winter I think I understand why.

Our Subie wagon is Titanium - a great color.  Looks good and hide dirt well.  There are not many options to order on the GT - CD player and alarm being the major ones.  I also have the spoiler which looks very good on the wagon.

Overall, this car is fun to drive with just the right balance of sportiness and ride comfort.  I have the 5 speed manaual - a very nice unit with short shifts and easy to use clutch.  The overall fun factor is high, although this car will not win any drag races.  Alot of heft to get moving off the line for the flat 4 2.5 liter engine.

The car is fairly quiet, especially at idle or highway speeds.  Under hard acceleration, the H-4 gets noisy, but not overly harsh like many 4 bangers.  My only recommendation to Subaru would be to offer a turbo on the GT or the new H-6.  A little more spunk and leather interior would make this Euro killer.

The interior is very nice.  I like the seats - I am a big guy and have no trouble getting comfortable.  I wish the interior had about 3 more inches of leg room total - and a bit wider (3 car seats in back will be a tough fit).  The hatch is great - this car call haul alot of stuff with the rear seat down.

So far only one problem - the driver door trim came loose. I think the stereo guys actually caused the problem but it was fixed under warrenty.  The AWD is awesome in the snow.  Forget traction control and FWD - AWD is the way to go.
