            I recently bought a 2000 Monte Carlo SS. I was looking for a nice comfortable car with many options but not a really large price.  Most of the cars I had looked at were in the $30,000 dollar range. Then I found the Monte Carlo SS.  Mine has a power sunroof, Leather seats, security system, a cassette and CD player, steering wheel radio controls, and an external AMP direct from the factory.  I don't have to worry about leaving my headlights on and having a dead battery because the car turns them on and off automatically when needed.  I love driving my car, the seats are very comfortable, my friends always joke that I could live in my car because of how roomy and comfortable the interior is.  I am a college student and I love my car, however it is kind of pricey for the average college student. The car is best suited for those who are young at heart, people who want fairly a large car, that has plenty of room for four adults and still have room for comfort.<br><br>
