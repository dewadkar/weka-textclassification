            I just love my Voyager!  I have a '96 voyager.  Although it is a 4 cylinder van, it works great for me!  I have 4 small children. My older two have plenty of leg room, and my younger 2 are both in car seats still.  I have plenty of room to put the 3yr olds car seat, and the baby carrier/car seat on the middle seat.  They don't touch, or get in the way of each other at all!  

This van handles like a car.  That was one of my biggest fears in buying a mini-van, that it would be too big to maneuver.  Boy was I wrong!  It is so easy to drive, I wouldn't go back to a regular car if I could.  There is a blind spot on the drivers side, but once you get around that you are set as far as vision goes.  I also live in a colder climate, and it handles really well in the snow!

As you can imagine with 4 kids I haul a lot of stuff around with me all the time.  I can fit all of my son's hockey equipment in the back and still have enough room for all of the baby's things too!  With the removable seats, even if I have really big stuff to move I can!  

I do a lot of driving, and I fill the tank up about once a week.  That is usually enough to get me around for the whole week.  It costs me about $20.00 each fill up and we pay about $1.37/gallon here.

I am even buying a new one so that my husband can have one too!! (He got tired of me driving him to work so I could have the van!)  I would recommend this to anyone looking for more space, and easy driving!<br><br>
