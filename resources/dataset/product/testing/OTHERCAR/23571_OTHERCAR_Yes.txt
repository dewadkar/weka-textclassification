            I am the proud owner of a 1998 Chevrolet Silverado K1500 truck.  This truck is the one that I had searched for endlessly, and finally found a few months ago.  I knew that I wanted to go with a Chevrolet because my
 family and I have never had good experiences with any other make of truck.  The Chevrolet that I own is a regular cab short bed Z-71 that currently has about 20,000 miles on it.  After buying this truck from a 
dealer, and since it was used when I bought it, I was a little wary that I may encounter problems with it down the road.  However, I am still as in love with this truck as I was the day I drove it off the lot.  Everything
 in it still works like new, it drives beautifully and smoothly, especially for a truck.  Best of all, it gets about eighteen miles per gallon.  I find myself having to get gas much less than I used to.  I 
would recommend this truck to anyone who likes trucks and is interested in purchasing one.  Everything about it of the highest quality, and you can't go wrong.  <br><br>
