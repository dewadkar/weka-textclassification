            This is my fourth Audi, my second V8. It is used daily for commuting to school in northern Nevada. The mileage is 153000 and climbing by 800 miles per week. For the money it is hard to imagine a more versatile vehicle. With minor mods (K and N air filter and 4prong platinum bosch plugs) the big Audi  gets 24.8 miles per gallon average. 
The full time quattro system has been trouble free. and it's comfortable. The only real challenges are finding internal trim parts.
Anything made of leather is almost impossible to find new. However luck would have it I found a parts source in southern California (4Audi) that has been very helpful. Over time I have replaced the front seats, ( I recommend the sports seats if you can find a car with them) the steering wheel, and other small trim items.
 The only major mechanical issues are getting replacement front brake rotors, they are very expensive and we have have been told it would be cheaper in the long run to replace the front brake rotors with an updated style. (the original are called UFO's)   Although Audi doesn't recommend it (believe it or not there is no recommended interval for transmission oil changes) we change  the transmission fluids on a regular interval on of 30k miles. The engine oil we change every 4k.
 This car is a true highway cruiser and feels like it's just waking up at the highest US  legal speeds. We have had the best luck with Pirelli 210 all weather tires. Because of the weight over the front wheels the fronts wear out first. Tire rotation is important for maximum tire life. 
There are two operational problems. One is in the worst of winter conditions the windshield defroster will not keep up. The second is the Blaupunkt radio which has the worst AM section I have ever heard. The upside for less than sixteen thousand dollars including purchase price, a smart person can buy one go through it and have a super machine which would cost over sixty thousand to purchase new. <br><br>
