            I LOVED my Park Avenue! Are you sick of unreliable cars that ALWAYS need repairs? Well if you're ready for a change I recommend the Buick Park Avenue! Some friends of ours drove one and it was always really nice but we didn't know much about it and we'd never had a buick before. We ended up inheriting a virtually new one just months later and have never owned a better car! After putting almost 150,000 miles on it in two years, it still ran beautifully and never needed more then rutine procedures such as oil changes, new tires, new break pads and an alignment! Every other car I've ever owned has needed much more then that by the time it ever hit the 100,000 mile mark. Not only does the car run great and look nice from the outside, but it's one of the most luxurious family cars that are priced affordibly as well. The seats provide perfect support for long drives as well as rejuvenating comfort for after work or long days in town. The only thing that ever went wrong with our car was that there was a recall on the paint it had but we took it to a Buick dealer and it was re-painted with no problems! The Buick Park Avenue is still my number one choice for a family car.<br><br>
