            Last July I was leaving for a trip to Europe and I was planning on taking lots of pictures. I wasn't looking forward to having to pack and haul around dozens of rolls of film. I decided I was going to buy a digital camera to take along instead. I figured the small camera and no film was going to be a plus. I was already taking my laptop, so I planned on downloading each night to keep the camera empty and charged.

I looked at just about every camera under $500 and finally decided on the Cannon S10. Why, you ask.....

Size - It is the same size or smaller than comparative cameras. It is small and feels good in your hand. Some of the cameras I picked up, felt cheap and fragile. This camera has a good weight and feels balanced in one hand or two. A good friend has the Cannon S100, which is similar to the S10 but even smaller. I found the S10 easier to use and far more flexible. It isn't that much bigger, but gives you more comfort in use.

Cost - As I stated before, I wanted to spend about $500 on a camera. I purchased the camera, the charger kit and an extra memory card for $512.00 after tax. I looked at the Kodak and Sony, which were close in price; they just didn't seem to have the feature set that the S10 offered.

Flexibility - This camera is amazingly adaptive. I have used this camera in just about every situation. When I was touring the Louvre in Paris I was able to take pictures without a flash and was amazed at the depth the camera pulled out of the paintings. 


Features - It has been a year now and I am still finding more features about this camera that I overlooked in the beginning. For instance, you can set it a mode to take panoramic pic's. It takes a pic and sets it in place on the LCD. Then you align the next pic on the LCD to the previous one. This allows you to be more accurate and not "double cover" an area. You can do side-by-side or even up and down. This will allow you to take a picture of a large building without having to be two miles away. Then you can import it to the included software, Photostitch 3.1 and it automatically meld the multiple pics into one. It works amazingly well. Another great feature is the ability to pre-program your settings. For instance, you get 3 settings on the top dial. I set one for very high resolution and compression, one for medium and one for small. This allows me to quickly change and take a picture and not have to waste time and battery life to re-program constantly. One of my favorite feature is the on board slide show. You can play the slide show and with an inexpensive adapter cable(camera has a video out), you can plug it into your VCR and make a tape of it. It is fun and a great way to send copies to family. I went as far as to add audio. Easy and very cool to look at.

Software - I have nothing but high praise for the included software. The main SW is Powershot. It is very easy to use and takes no time to learn. Photo record is photo album software. It lays out you pictures to look like they are in a photo album. You can customize your pictures as well as the book layout. Photostitch is the software I talked about earlier that takes multiple shots and melds them together into one pic. Works great. It also comes with Adobe Photo. I have not really used this, but it is SW that you can edit the pic's with. 

Con's - The only negative things that I have against this camera are the variable battery life and it doesn't react well to "concert style" lighting. The latter well may be my own ignorance and lack of understanding of picture taking. I have "snuck" the camera in (again, great size for that) to a number of concerts and have had mixed results. The farther I am from the stage, the worse the focus. As for the battery life, if you avoid the desire to take pictures looking at the LCD and not through the viewfinder the battery life are decent. This is something that takes some time and discipline.

Finally, I have a couple of suggestions for anyone that is going to buy or already has purchased the S10. Buy the charger kit and use the battery that comes with the camera as a back up only. Also, get a 32MB card and use the 8 MB as a backup. This allows you to not have to miss a picture because youï¿½re on your last shot and you want to wait for the "perfect" one.
