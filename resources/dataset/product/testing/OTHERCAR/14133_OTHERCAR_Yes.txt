            My Fuji 1300 was my first digital camera when I purchased it back in 2000.  I still own it and use it!!

What I liked most about it, since it was also one of the many digital cameras I sold at my job at the time, was that it was very easy to set up.  No major scrolling or button pushing.  Everything was marked very clear on the dial in the back.  Plus, it's the same size, or smaller than, some 35mm cameras, so it was not awkward to travel with.  Plus, stocking up on the Smart Media cards sure is a lot easier than toting around film all the time!!  The size, quality, ease of use and price in my opinion are the best for a camera in the 1.3 MP range.

I recommend this camera for people who enjoy photography as a hobby, and e-mail and upload images often.  It is also great for people who would like a back up to their film pictures, especially at important events.  For example, at my sister�s graduation, we brought the 35mm and my digital, and the film didn�t load correctly and we would not have had anything at all from her big day if we didn�t have the digital. 

I have been very satisfied with image quality and its "printability".  Images on low resolution will make great 5x7's and smaller, and 8x10's of fair quality.  The low resolution is also great for those who take pictures for the Internet, whether for web design or e-mail.  They load quickly and require little resizing.  High resolution will make excellent 8x10's and smaller.  

Memory storage on the 8 MB smart media card is 89 pictures on low resolution (640x480), and 12 on high resolution.  Downloading into the computer is also very easy.  Install the software, plug it in, and transfer.  What I suggest to save battery power is to immediately copy the pictures to your hard drive.  It also saves sanity when you accidentally select "clear all" instead   of "clear image" later.  Then, after they are transferred to your hard drive, shut the camera off, and edit away!

Adobe Photo Deluxe is my primary image-editing program.  It's easy to learn how to use the basics, and I've had my program for two years, and I am still learning all of the fascinating things it can do!  The tutorials on it are very clear, and each editing choice walks you through step-by-step.  

The features I like most on my camera are the self-timer and continuous picture taking (though it is only ideal in conditions where flash isn't necessary).  Digital flash settings work a little different than film, so I do recommend taking some practice shots.  I found that if you're at a museum, and items are in glass cases, placing it on red-eye reduction reduces the glare.  In some conditions, no-flash will produce a muddy image, as will suppressed flash.  The manual settings will allow you to accommodate for various types of lighting. 

The durability is great.  I�m notorious for putting my cameras in peril, so the fact that mine is a little survivor speaks highly of it. Mine has been accidentally dunked for a brief moment in a kayaking accident, dropped on cement, rained on and dropped in the snow.  It has been in extreme heat, and extreme cold, and on beaches.  Through all of these, it has survived, pictures and all.  The worst that happened was the batteries came out when dropped.  It has also taken weather conditions and accidents better than my 35mm cameras.  The best part is, there is never any fear of film being exposed or destroyed during some of these conditions.  This is the first time I�ve had a camera last me this long through so many conditions, and I�m not one that would normally put such an expensive camera (for me at least!) through such conditions.

The downside of the camera is that it has digital, rather than optical zoom.  I've been relatively happy with my zoomed pictures, but I do not use my zoom often. Some zoomed pictures may be a little fuzzy.  Also, the zoom only works on the low resolution.  If you're a person who wants a camera with high quality zoom, this may not be for you.

Batteries are always a damper to the digital experience.  Depending on the battery brand, mine have lasted from 100 exposures up to 500 exposures.  DO NOT get lithium, they get hot too quickly and could leak.  I use, believe it or not, the "generic" Everactive brand sold at Wal Mart.  I've had lots of time to experiment with various battery brands, and those have been the most reliable and longest lasting, and half the cost of the more expensive brands.  Most people like rechargeable batteries, however if you travel often, rechargeable are not always the best option.

The whole beauty of digital photography is the fact that there is no one else between you and your pictures.  No more lost film, damaged rolls, unexposed (blank) rolls, and no damage done by the lab.  I�ve taken pictures for years, and worked in a photo lab and have seen and experienced all the tragedies that film can go through.  No more worrying about vacation, or important event pictures not coming out.  YOU control your pictures, and no one sees them before you.  Reprints can be made with a few clicks of a mouse, and not having to sort through negatives and blind your self by holding them up to the light to find the right one.  You can see your pictures right away, and delete them as you go along.  There will be no more wasted film and money.  There is also the opportunity to take even more pictures than ever.  The smart media cards are very small, and the 8 MB card can hold about 3 rolls of film on low resolution.  Smart media cards are very affordable, and a 64 MB card can hold about 24 rolls of film worth of pictures on low resolution.  That is, for a one-time cost (that capacity runs about $50), unlimited use of 24 rolls of film.  Fill up the card, transfer it to your hard drive, delete the card, and use it again and again!  The greatest part, no more buying film and having it processed and developed.  If you take pictures as often as I do, it will pay itself off in a few months with the money saved.  

Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my camera, and it's helped me with my websites a great deal.  The product and software are easy to learn, and you can more or less take pictures as soon as you get it out of the box, load the card and batteries, and turn it on.  They print out very well on a photo-quality printer.  It fits my needs and my budget.
