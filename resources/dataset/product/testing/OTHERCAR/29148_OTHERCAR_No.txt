            I bought this camera only because I received a $250 Toshiba gift card as part of a class-action lawsuit settlement.  I hadn't been in the market for a digital camera, and honestly had given them almost no thought.

When I got that card in the mail, I really couldn't think of anything from Toshiba that I wanted and didn't yet have, so at my wife's suggestion, bought the camera.  My method was simple, log onto Toshiba's website and get whatever camera I could for equal or less than our card amount.  We had only two choices, the PDR-M21, and the PDR-M11, which is identical in every way save its lower 1.3 MP resolution.  THe 2.1 MP model was exactly our price limit, and after tax and shipping, we paid $40 out of our own pocket.

As a $40 camera, the PDR-M21 is phenominal, however as a $250 product, it leaves much to be desired.  Of course, we bought it in late 2001, when $250 was very little for a digital camera, however even the $250 models of the time had real autofocus (PDR-M21 is fixed focus) and at least a 2X optical zoom.  The PDR-M21 has only a 2X digital zoom, and unless you are shooting on the highest quality mode, the picture quality is very poor with the zoom engaged.

The camera came with an 8MB smartmedia card, however at the time I ordered, they were bundling a 32MB card for free, giving us 40MB total on the two.  I usually leave it set to highest resolution and highest quality JPEG setting (the camera also supports higher quality TIFF format), and can take 32 photos on the large card.

The camera body is large, which makes it very comfortable to hold.  There is a rubberized strip on the front making that grip very secure, however the same bulk that makes it a pleasure to point and shoot, makes it rather hard to stash in a purse (yes, I'm a guy and I carry a small purse).  This camera is almost 2 inches thick, though in other dimensions it looks just like a cheap 35mm camera.  The camera is controlled by a single dial at the top, and it is easy, however it is also easy to inadvertently turn the camera on while carrying it.

Finally, transfering images from the camera to your PC is VERY slow.  I recently purchased a new Canon S200 Digital Elph, and that camera can transfer a full 64MB CF card worth of photos to the PC in less than half the time the PDR-M21 takes to transfer the contents of its 32MB SM card.  The difference is very obvious, and makes using the Canon MUCH more satisfying.

For casual photos, of the sort you would use a disposable camera for, the PDR-M21 is perfectly fine, though for the price, I really think you can do better.  The same $250 that the Toshiba cost when I bought it can buy a VERY nice 3MP camera (or the 2MP Digital Elph) with optical zoom and much higher quality.  Perhaps I'll give the Toshiba to my 8-year-old daughter who loves taking pictures, CDR is much cheaper than film.
