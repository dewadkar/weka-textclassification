            	That's the best thing I can say when it comes to my former car, a 1987 Toyota Tercel.  My mother had purchased the car in 1987 and gave it to me when I turned 16.  I drove the Toyota from the time I got my license until last year when I turned 21.  

	I didn't think that the '87 Toyota would ever kick the bucket.  I sure glad when it did though, because I really desired a new car.  Other than typical maintenance, the car didn't really have any major catastrophic problems until its last year. By then I was wishing death on the thing!

	I highly recommend any Toyota Tercel.  It doesn't necessarily have to be an ancient model like the one I drove either. I know of some folks with newer models that have really been reliable as well. This is really fabulous vehicle for anyone.  

	If you want a car that'll give you over 10 years of use, a Tercel is a wise buy.  They've gotten pretty nice-looking over the years. The '87 version was kind of boxy.  Even though it was an older car, it was still the nicest looking car at my old high school.  Not a speck of rust in all its years and that's pretty darn good considering all the rough winters in Buffalo!

	The Tercel also offers a very smooth and quiet ride.  The only time it was noisy was when there was something wrong with the car, and until its last year that was a rare case. 

	If comfort is your desire, the Tercel is extremely cozy.  You could sleep in the seats and not have back problems the next day.  This is a good quality for busy folks on the road frequently.  It wouldn't be to pleasant to be in a car for an extensive period of time in an uncomfortable seat now, would it?  The Tercel will give you the comfort you need. 

	The Tercel also drives very good in the winter.  It doesn't slide all over the road like a Camaro or Firebird, that's for sure.  Those cars are useless in the winter and seem to always be sporting dents to prove it around my area.  Unless you enjoy frequent fender-benders and higher insurance rates, you may want to consider buying a car for its reliability and comfort rather than its outside appearance.  People that buy cars based solely on looks need their heads examined.  So if you want a cute little car that is also reliable, I highly recommend the Toyota Tercel.  

	For those who enjoy music on the road, Toyota offers a quite impressive stereo for your listening pleasure.  Superior high-quality sounds pulsating from the speakers if I ever heard it!  The stereo didn't have to be replaced until I graduated from high school in 1996.  Pretty long life for a car stereo, huh?!  Nothing was really wrong with it either, except for the fact that it started eating some of my favorite cassettes. I just desired a cd player in the car since cassettes had slowly started to slowly dissipate from the record store racks.  CDs are more practical than tapes anyway!  Since times were a-changing and technology was improving, I didn't want to have a car which contained an outdated stereo. The car dealer would probably have laughed at me when it came to trade-in time.  

	So if you want a car that's going to give you the most miles for your bucks, buy a Toyota Tercel.  My car lasted for almost 200000 miles and yours can too!  I was in awe by what the Mitsubishi dealer gave me for my dead Toyota last year.  50 big ones!  What more can you ask for after about 13 years!?<br><br>
