            I bought this truck for the Quad cab, which was the largest Extenda-Cab available at the time.  (I have 2 kids &amp; I needed the extra seating.)
I bought the 2WD with the standard V-8 engine. The vehicle is quiet and smooth-riding, with plenty of power.  Finish is good.  
I particularly like to fold-down center console: it is easy to enter &amp; is big enough to hold lots of stuff (air gauge, owner's manual, band-aids, etc.) but not big enough to lose things in.  When the console is raised, the front seat safely seats 3 people.
I have had no maintenance problems other than the glasses holder in the overhead console: the latch has broken twice in one year. Both times,however, the dealer replaced the item without charge.
The cab has a lot of room. I'm 6'1&quot; and usually slide the driver's seat all the way back in any vehicle, but not so in the Ram.  This leaves usable seating space behind the driver.
Gas mileage could be better -- I get about 15 to 16 on the highway with the tailgate down and about 12 in town; not much better than the Suburban I used to have.<br><br>
