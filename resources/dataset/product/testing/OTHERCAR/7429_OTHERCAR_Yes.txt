            I've been a proud owner of a 2001 S40 for over a month now and have about 2300 miles on the car - I've loved every mile I've put on the car!!

I love driving smaller cars, after driving a Jeep Grand Cherokee for over a year now I am more than happy to give the SUV to my wife (who loves it) and get my hands on this gem!  Supposedly, Volvo has been selling the 40 series in Europe for most of the second half of the 1990s, but has just brought the series to North America beginning with the 2000 model year.

The car is competitively priced starting at $23,500 fairly well equipped.  Standard features include automatic, A/C with pollen filter, power doors, power windows, power mirrors, and many other features (too many to list).

The thing that sold me on this car and with Volvo itself is their commitment to safety.  This car doesn't disappoint - it features a steel safety cage, six airbags (yes, six - two front, two side, two side head), whiplash protection seats, side impact protection system, daytime running lights, ABS, etc.  I really feel safe, and having a little one on the way this is even more important.

OK, now to the drive - the car is VERY sporty!  Yes, there is only a 4-cylinder engine, but this is hands down the BEST 4 on the market today.  There is very little body roll in corners, and road handling is very good.  The suspension is fairly sporty, so there is a bit of road feel, but it is not a harsh ride at all.

Volvo offers many options for this model, and they can escalate the price of the vehicle to and past the price of the new S60.  I opted for the weather package which includes dynamic stability assistance (compensates when the car detects slippage of the wheels), heated seats, and headlight windshield wipers (which I believe are the silliest things - to each his own).  I also opted for the Atlantic Blue Metallic paint, which is stunning!  I wish I had also opted for the sunroof, and I could care less about leather seats (again, to each his own).

All in all, I am 100% satisfied with my purchase thus far.  If this car continues to meet my expectations, they are going to have a customer "for life".
