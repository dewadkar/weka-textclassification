            Ahhh&#133the love of technology.  This digital camera is fun and easy to use.  It features 6 times optical zoom/2 times digital zoom and has up to 2.1 mega pixel resolution.  It uses Smart Media memory cards, which are wafer thin and pretty inexpensive.  The compact stylish design is very modern while allowing practical ease of use.  It utilizes four AA sized batteries or AA sized rechargeable NiMH batteries which are perfect for picture outings. You&#146ll never have to worry about proprietary rechargeable batteries that will leave you hanging while on vacation.  The Fuji camera has simple point and shoot ease for excellent outdoor photography and is pretty quick for taking successive pictures under good lighting conditions.  The FinePix 2800 has several different modes of operation including photo (auto mode for regular snap shots), Macro (close ups for flowers/small objects), self timer (when you don&#146t have someone around to take your picture), picture with 30 second voice captioning, up to one minute movie mode with sound, continuous shooting and several other features that will allow you to take excellent photos. 

What&#146s great:

FinePix 2800 has 6 times optical zoom with is equivalent to 35mm-228mm zoom on a normal camera.  Combine that with 2 megapixel resolution and you are able to get excellent close up shots of distant objects.  I was able to use the optical zoom feature to zoom in on a ship on the Atlantic while at a beach, snap a photo, and then use the 5 times zoom feature while viewing the picture on the camera to read the name of the ship!  Outdoor photography is excellent.  Just simply point and shoot.  You are able to set the resolution manually for VGA up to 2 megapixel pictures. The camera has manual menu driven settings that allow you to set white balance for different light sources and exposure compensation.  This is needed for some indoor photography.  The operation manual is easy to use and very straightforward.  It takes the technical out of digital camera operation and even comes with a quick start card.  The menu operation of the camera is logical and easy to use which is a big plus.  You don&#146t want to spend a lot of time playing with menus when you want to snap photos.  I paid $279 plus shipping from an on-line retailer.  The camera cost a hundred dollars more at Circuit City, CompUSA and Ritz Camera stores!  You really get a ton of features for the price.  I believe that there is no comparison when you consider the optical zoom feature.  Transferring pictures from the camera to your computer is quick and easy and comes with a USB cable.  You can also buy a Smart Media Card reader for your USB or even a floppy disk that allows you to insert the media for easy access to your photos.  Window XP user will not need to install the software for picture viewing.  The movie playback on the camera also records sound.  It&#146s a fun feature.  The battery life is good.  I would go through 4 AA sized regular alkaline batteries after a day of intensive shooting outdoors (no flash).  I think they last well for an electronic device.  Plus batteries are pretty inexpensive.  You can also use  rechargeable NiMh batteries to save the environment and your wallet.  You&#146ll just need to buy an inexpensive recharger as well. The camera can also be used as a web-cam. 

The not so great:

The auto focus feature has a hard time focusing on objects in poorly lit locations such as a dark room or at night. You&#146ll have to find an object that is well illuminated at the same distance to obtain focus using the focus lock feature. It&#146s not a big issue just one to keep in mind.  Also&#133as with many digital cameras&#133 you&#146ll need to have a steady hand or use a tripod for natural light shots that normally require flash in order to avoid picture blurring.  The camera has a camera shake warning feature that will notify you when there is a chance of occurrence.  Movie playback with sound was pretty dark when viewed on my computer.  It was excellent when viewed from the camera&#146s LCD screen.  It could&#146ve been user error though.  I&#146m scratching my head on that one. The electronic viewfinder and LCD screen can be dark in poor lighting conditions. The bundled software for viewing your pictures installed easily.  I just wished that it had a no-nonsense Windows' style of interface with the program&#146s buttons. The program is simple to use.  It&#146s just a little different.  

Just a little note:  I have not tried printing photo quality pictures using my printer. You&#146ll need to consider your printer quality specifications if you want the What You See Is What You Get quality.  You can take the Smart Media Cards to film developers to view the actual quality of your photos printed. Stop by an electronics store to get a hands-on feel for the camera. You&#146ll be surprised at it&#146s actual size and the features.
