            My daughter decided that it was time for her to purchase her first new car.  She started looking at small affordable vehicles.  Initially she wanted the Toyota Corolla.  Her father has one and she loved it.  Last year Toyota had come out with a new design to their Corollas and they were hard to find.  

I finally looked at my daughter and said <i>"What about a Honda?"</i>  Her response, wanting to be the different one, said<i>"Everyone has one!"</i>

True, true.  <b>But</b> why does everyone have one?  Is it:  The price?  The reliability?  The look of the vehicle? Or all of the above?

Well this put the bug in her head and we went to look at Honda Civics online and at several dealerships.  As time seemed to move on, my daughter got more and more anxious.  She wanted her new car.  BUT, her father, he had to get the best car deal.  Finally the day came - We opened up the newspaper and there they were "Honda Civics - 5 at a wonderful price."  <b>$15,600</b>

We toodled on down to the dealership and found her dream car.  There it was her new Clover Green 4 door Honda Civic Ex.

We did not get many upgrades in the car because everything she wanted in a new car was a standard feature.  However, she did have to have the rear spoiler, an alarm and floor mats. 
 

<b>~~STANDARD FEATURES~~</b>

I was highly impressed with all of the standard features that come with the Honda Civic Ex.  Some of the great standard features of the Honda Civic Ex are:

*  AM/FM CD Player with 4 speakers - the most important vehicle feature for a music lover

*  Air Conditioner - perfect for the California Sunshine

*  Power windows / door lock 

*  Power sunroof / moonroof - When the sunroof is open it causes a little more added noise to your drive.  Nice feature, but something I could live without.

*  Trunk / gas tank lever inside the car

*  Tinted Windows - a must have!

*  Cruise Control and Intermittent windshield wipers

*  Rear Defroster - I have always loved my rear defroster and I was happy to see that the Honda had it too.

*  Remote keyless entry - This is a great feature on the car.  The locks can be controlled my a remote controller.  If your hands are full you simply push a button on the remote and your doors unlock for you.

Please note that these are just some of the highlighted options.  There are many more!


<b>~~GAS MILEAGE AND OTHER THINGS TO KNOW~~</b>

This is a little about the gas mileage, engine size and such for those that need to know.  Myself, I need to know that the car can go a little faster than the speed limit and looks pretty. :)

*  The engine is a little 4 cylinder VTEC 1.7 liter engine.  Although it sounds gutless, it does have get up and go.  Since my daughter has been driving her Honda, I have noticed that she exceeds the speed limit now.  

*  The gas tank is a 13 gallon gas tank and gets exceptional gas mileage:  30 city/38 highway.

*  My daughter got the automatic transmission. 

*  The braking system on the Honda are ABS brakes with disc brakes on the front and drum brakes on the rear.


<b>~~MY EXPERIENCES~~</b>

I have driven my daughter's car on several occasions and I love it.  The car handles well and is perfect for jetting in and out of traffic.  

While driving her car, I did not notice any blind spots or hard to see out of areas.  It was easy to look out in all directions and see if the traffic was clear.

The Honda Civic Ex fits in most compact parking spots with ease and there is room left over so you do not get door dings. 

My husband and I have taken the car on a mini road trip and the car fits five small adults comfortably for a short period of time.  I sat in the back seat with some friends and it was a little squished, but by the time we were uncomfortable, it was time to get out of the car.  There was plenty of leg room for the three of us, but there would not have been if our husbands had sat in the back seats.

I have a friend who had a few problems with her Honda Civic's air conditioning.  My daughter's air conditioning is perfect.  It blows out cool air and it cools the car down within minutes.  Sometimes it is hard to regulate the air because it can get too cold in her car.  

Most of the controls for the radio / air conditioning / heater / cruise control are within easy reach for the driver.  As a driver changing the radio station or turning something on or off, it is a simple reach and you can still leave one hand on the wheel and your eyes somewhat on the road.  

Basically, I have only driven the car within the city that I live in.  It is perfect for stop and go traffic and keeps up well on the freeway.  It has a lot of get up and go when I need to increase my speed upon entering the freeway.


<b>~~OVERALL THOUGHTS~~</b>

My daughter has had her Honda for about a year now and loves it.  She has taken many little road trips and finds that the car is comfortable enough for her.  I have read many reviews that the car is a little noisy.  I think for the size and compactablity of the car, the noise should be expected.      

I feel that the Honda Civic was the best choice for my daughter's first new car.  So far the car has been reliable and fun for her to drive.


<b>~~WARRANTY & MAINTENANCE~~</b>

The Honda Civic comes with a 36 month/36000 mileage warranty.

Honda says that the car can go 110,000 miles before you will need to get your first scheduled tune-up.  However you will still need to get your oil changes and other fluids changed.
