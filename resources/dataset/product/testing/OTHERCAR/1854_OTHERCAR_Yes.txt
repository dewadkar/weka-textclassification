            I bought this car a few months ago because we heard it was a good reliable car and my fiance wanted one. it only had 38,00 miles on it when we bought it.  No complaints really.  I will never buy black again because it is a pain to keep clean. Other than that it is awesome. very beefy for a 3.1 v6.  Handling is awesome and the seats are very comfortable.  We bought the GT model.  I love the tilt steering wheel and the alloy rims. I do wish it was a little more roomy in the back.  But that doesn't really mater since i don't ride back there.
Great trunk space.  I also like how you how you can turn off the Enhanced Traction System with the click of a button. It also has the feature where if the proper key isn't used the computer won't allow any fuel into the engine.  making it virtually impossible to steal.  A lot better than an alarm since people just usually ignore them.  As far as a sound system it is one of the best factory i have heard.  They actually pur a a pair of tweeters up at ear level.  Which really helps out.  i am a bit of  an audiophile so i really appreciate the the graphic eq on the cd player.<br><br>
