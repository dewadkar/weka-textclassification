            We traded in our 1995 4Runner for this van. It was an awesome trade. Oldsmobile is currently offering 0.9% financing which means you are paying virtually no interest. We were very impressed with how comfortable the van was. It is amazing how much more room there is and how much more better a trip is in the van.
The van is equipped with tether hooks and the LATCH system. And the dual doors make getting my son in and out so much easier. 
The van also came with a 6 year/60,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty. This is another great incentive. 
The gas mileage is about 19/26. Not to mention the fact that it has a 24 gallon gas tank and uses low grade gas.
There is also an air compressor built into the back, so in theory you could inflate your own tires.
OnStar is free for a year with all new vans. Basically it will unlock your car, help in an emergency, etc. Very nice feature.
The upper end models have leather interior, power sliding doors, and some have entertainment systems. I was not interested in paying that much more and I am totally satisfied with my base model. (with a tire upgrade and traction control upgrade!)
