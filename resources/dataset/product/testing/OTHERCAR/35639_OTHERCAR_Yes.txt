            I own a 93 1/2 premier edition Toyota supra that is truly the best car I have ever owned!  I bought this car used back in 1997 for a very good price, and if I sold this car today I would make money on it!

There are a lot of good things about this car.  It has beautiful lines and handles wonderfully!  The interior is very comfortable and almost feels like you are in a cockpit of an airplane.  This car also has a lot of power, even on the non-turbo version (side note: I own a non-turbo version that has been converted to a single turbo and boy does it fly with 400+ horsepower!).  Even after owning this car for 3 years, it has not been in the shop for anything other than regular maintenance!

But like everything, there is always something that has to be bad.  These cars are hard to come by mainly because between 1993 and 1998, they only made just over 10,000 of these cars, the non-turbo's being the most rare.  Because they are so desired, dealers will increase the price according to mileage and shape and people will still buy them up (recently, there was a car dealership just down the street from my home that had a 1994 Turbo with 32,000 miles on it and they were asking $30,000 for the car!).  

Another bad thing about this car is the insurance if you don't have a perfect driving record.  My insurance company doesn't even know the car is a turbo now and with his 2 tickets, our insurance is outrageous!  So basically, if you like to drive fast, you better have a good lawyer!

I highly recommend this car to just about everyone!  I had always wanted to own one of these cars and have not been disappointed!  It is a total head-turner!!<br><br>
