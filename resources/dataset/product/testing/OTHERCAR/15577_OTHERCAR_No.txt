            When my Wife and I purchased our 1999 Mitsubishi Monetro Sport In July we were taken back by its overall good, rugged, looks.  The fact that we were not encountering this vehicle at every stoplight like the 4 Runner and Chrysler products intrigued us.  Since we purchased the vehicle, though, we have been plagued with rattles, grinds, and poor handling in all conditions.  Every complaint we have had so far, from a whining rear differential to water accumulating in the rear garnish have been met with the dealer insisting that these things are not to be worried about and are classic 'abnormalities' associated with 'this type of vehicle'.<br><br>
