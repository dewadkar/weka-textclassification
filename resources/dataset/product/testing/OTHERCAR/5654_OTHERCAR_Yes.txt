            First off I have the 2.8 model which is a step up from the standard model. Overall I love this car for its simplicity and performance. From a standing start I feel I can run with the best of the best, and looks forget about it. I don't think anyone would not look twice at this baby. Arctic silver with black interior, CD changer in the back, and hard top. The only thing I had trouble with was the rear plastic window, which would develop a crease or pit marks if the top came down awkward, but I found a solution. Take a broom handle and cut it down to the full length of the window. Wrap a terry cloth towel around it and secure with string or rubber bands. Place this in the middle of the window when lowering the top and presto, every time you open the top back no creases or pit marks. I also definitely recommend the hard top for winter climates. All in all this car is a pleasure to drive all year around.
