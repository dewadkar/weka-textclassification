               This is a Nice camera For beginers. There isn't much setup and the instructions are very descriptive! There are only four buttons. (the power, the flash, select and delete.) Power Turns the camera on and off. (you have to hold it down for a few seconds the the light right above it will come on and you know the camera's on. 
   The flash buttons has four setting that you change by hitting the button multiple times. There is Auto flash, This setting the flash is always on. the next is Fill flash which is used when there is a bright light behind the object your taking a picture of. After that is red Eye Reduction. This you use on people and animals to keep from getting that ugly red eye in your pictures! Last but not Least is Flash Off. You can use this when the flash isn't needed or when a flash isn't alowed. When you select these settings the LCD screen displays the name of the setting and  brief disctription like I did. 
   The Next button is Select. This is used like an enter or OK button. When you go to settings on the switch at the bottom (I'll describe that later) you yous the select button to "select" the setting you want. This button also serves as the zoom button. This camera has 3x digital zoom.(which means you can get 3 times closer without moving) The only problem with this is that the LCD screen has to be on to use it! 
   The delete button is on the bottom of the 4 buttons. This lets you delete any unwanted pictures. That way you don't take up too much space on the internal memory.(or your multimedia card if you have one.) 
   Right next to the Row of buttons there is an arrow key it is circular with little arrows pointing up down and left and right. this can be used to view you pictures (left and right) or change settings.  (also left and right) While viewing you pictures if you hit select it lets you zoom in on it and then you can use the arrow button to view different parts of you  picture.
   Directly under that is a Switch that has 3 settings on it. It has a picture of a camera, which lets you take the pictures. Next is what looks like a play button. This allows you to view your pictures. third is the Settings this has a picture of a check mark. This has 7 options. You can change the language, change the date and time,View you pictures in a slide show,change the immage quality (the defult is best),Copy pictures from your internal memory to a MMC, get info on the camera, or format your MMC (multimedia card).
   The camera comes with a video cable and video out puts on it. This means that if you have a Video input on your TV you can view your pictures from your TV.(this way the whole family can see the amazing pictures you've taken. Kids love to see themselves on TV) 
   It has 37mm lens and auto focus. All you have to do is push the shutter button down halfway before you take the picture! That simple!
   There Is a USB cable that comes with it that you hook to the computer and to the camera to download your pictures to the computer. It comes with the Kodak picture transfering software which lets you transfer the pictures to cpmputer and also lets you view and modify them. This software also contains Email and Print abilitys.
   You can buy the Easy share dock for the camera too. This makes downloading pictures easier. all you have to do is set the camera in the dock and push the button on it. This also recharges your batteries for another day of picture taking! 

   I've had a great expeirence with this camera and I think you will too! I'm uploading pictures to my website soon so you can see how great the turn out.
