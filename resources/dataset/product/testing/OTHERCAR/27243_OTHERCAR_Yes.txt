            With all of the <i>muscle</i> cars on the market today I prefer the Pontiac Trans Am.  The look and style of the F-body sports car is one that appeals to me in all sorts of ways.  Although I don't own a Pontiac Trans Am, I have driven several by way of test drives and several of my friends own them as well.

<b>Good:</b>
The Pontiac Trans Am is equipped with a 5.7l 305 horses.  That is more horses that my Chevrolet Silverado and all you can just imagine what it will do crammed into a sports car.  If you decide to go with the optional Ram Air air intake package then you can up the horses to an even larger 320 horses with 340lbs of torque.  That, ladies and gentlemen, is pure performance that can't be topped by any other sports car except for maybe the $100,000 sports cars.

As I mentioned earlier the look and style of this car is beautiful.  It's sleek shape gives it that &quot;fast&quot; definement.  It's the look and feel of speed.  It will always turn the heads of onlookers whether they are car lovers or not.  Amazingly the looks of this car have always been good looking, even when the sports car first came out.  Not only does it give pleasure to the onlooker but also the driver.  The feel of sitting in the cockpit of this car is a feeling unlike no other.  You can feel the performance and the amount of power through your hands on the steering wheel.  It's a wonderful feeling experienced by no other.  

The road handling and stability is also wonderful with this car.  It literally hugs the road and takes tight turns without even a shift of the body.  It easily accelerates around corners and the traction, even on wet surfaces. is unbelievable.  Although the Chevrolet Corvette has a Traction Control Button, the Pontiac Trans Am hugs the road on it's own without the use of a button.

The interior design is perfectly laid out for the user to get maximum visibility.  All of the controls and gadgets are conveniently located for easy reach.  The gas gauges and speedometer are right in front of the eye and the convenience gets even better with steering wheel radio controls.  The plastic areas on the car are very stable unlike other plastic parts on other cars as well.  The convertible top is easily put up and down in  less than 30 seconds and it's a very tight seal that lets no leaks in at all.

<b>Bad:</b>
Although the feeling of sitting in the cockpit is very wonderful, the visibility is rather thin.  There are several blind spots and because the seats are low it's hard for short people, like me, to see over the steering wheel.  The rear window is rather small and difficult to see through even in the rearview mirror.

This car is very heavy.  It's weight is a negative factor when it comes to racing this car.  There is also no room in the back seat at all.  There is no room for children, toddlers, and much less adults.  You might fit a few boxes in the seat just for storage but I would only recommend putting passengers in the back for only short trips around the block. 

There are very few cons to this car and the pros totally overload the short amount of them.  This is my dream car as you can probably see.  Although I love off-roading in my truck I also love the performance in the acceleration of this car.  Check it out for yourself.  Thanks!
