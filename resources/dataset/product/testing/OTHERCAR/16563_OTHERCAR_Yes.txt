            This car is great!!  I picked up a used 1991 Jetta this summer and I have had nothing but good things to say about it.  I have only had to get oil changes on it and nothing has had to be fixed on it to date.  I love the way it handles and there is enough room in thr trunk for a small circus act!  I use this car to get me to and from CT while I am in College and I can fit everything in it that I need to without any problem.  I must say that it is a light weight car and so it is a bit tricky in the snow, but not horrendous to drive by any means.  I would definately say that if someone is looking for a cheap used car to get a lot out of the Jetta is for you!<br><br>
