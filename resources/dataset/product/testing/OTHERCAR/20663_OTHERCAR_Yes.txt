            This is our second Audi. The last one we owned for 3 years and were very happy with it. It did not have much power but it handled very nicely. The new one is a 2.7T with enormous power and luxury.
 We checked out the E320 and found it not as luxurious as this car. We install the navigational computer and it works flawlessly. It does not need any attention from the driver since it gives verbal commands. My wife loves this feature since she can take all the detours when encountering heavy traffic. 
All the seats are heated and the quattro traction is unbelievable. This car will go where no Jeep has gone before. I also have a Chevy Tahoe and when it snows or it is icy I wish I had my wife's Audi. I am seriously considering purchasing another one for our household and dumping the truck. 
The service is great since we pay nothing even brakes, which only wore out once in three years. With our 1992 Infinity Q45 my wife changed 6 sets of brakes driving the same mileage. I think this car is the best for it's price range. Don't let dealers fool you with traction controls on rear wheels. They just don't work. <br><br>
