            I was given this car by my mom.  It has been constant problems from the beginning.  It started with small repairs, like the turning signals.  Since then, I've replaced the engine twice.  I wouldn't have even bothered replacing it twice, if I didn't get a good deal from a family mechanic.  Since the last replaced engine, I have had to have it repaired three times.  Most recently, the check engine light kept coming on, it was sputtering and stalling, and three mechanics (outside of my family) have been unable to figure out what's wrong with it.  I can't wait to get another car, and the next one will NOT be a Skylark!
