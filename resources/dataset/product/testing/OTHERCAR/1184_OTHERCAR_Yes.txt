            i recently bought a new 2000 dodge neon. A car i had always told my self i would never buy that is till they came out with a new body style.  the new body blows the old ugly style away the car also has a whole lot more leg room than the older neon's had.  Since it's a small car the 132 horse power engine it's got in it is perfect to pull the car on and off the highway. my car is still fairly new but i have yet to have problems with it and the ride is one of the smoothest i have had in a compact vehicle so if i had to stress what i thought were the best features would be it would have to be the look it has ,the spacious interior, the standard 6 speaker system it comes with, and the great gas mileage, so if you've got some cash and need a reliable car with style that wont leave the pockets dry i strongly suggest the new dodge neon.<br><br>
