            Don't purchase an SUV until you've tried this one.  The Mercury Mountaineer is not only one of the sweetest looking vehicles out there, but its also packed with power.  Its 5.0L V8 engine gives this baby the ability to do anything.  It combines the power of an SUV with the looks of a luxury vehicle.  

One of my favorite things about the Mountaineer is its don't-lift-a-finger-to-switch-on 4WD.  As soon as the vehicle senses that it is on rough terrain, the 4WD automatically switches on.  This feature gives the Mountaineer great handling in snow and other slippery situations.  

Internally, the comfortable leather seats, great factory stereo system, and highly accessible dash controls make the Mountaineer as nice to sit in as it is to look at.<br><br>
