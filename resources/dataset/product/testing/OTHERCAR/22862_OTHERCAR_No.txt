            I do not own this vehicle, but my brother-in-law does and I must say that it seems that to own it is to love it.  I've read all the other reviews for this vehicle (1999-2001) and their owners seem to praise it too.  I'm looking at it from the outside, and not the person who paid close to $30,000 for it.  I have driven the vehicle several times both on road and off road and I'm not impressed with the exterior nor the interior.
 
The styling is definitely love-it or leave-it.  Everyone that I've spoken to either thinks it's 'cool' or it's 'ugly.'  No in between.  For me, it is definitely a unique style like no other vehicle out there, for that alone, I give it a thumbs up.  For good or for bad, this car does receive a second glance from those that see it.  You won't lose it at the mall parking lot, that's for sure.

The interior is a totally different story.  It is average at best.  I have read that the dash is straight from the Isuzu Trooper, which was not a great interior to begin with.  For a 1999 vehicle, the gauges, buttons, and knobs on the car all look like something from a mid 80's Dodge or something.  Does not fit the exterior look at all.  The color scheme is 'different.'  It's black leather (fair quality) with red leather accents.  The seats are not power adjustable, but comfortable.  You can extend the seating surface by a pulling or pushing a retractable extender on the front of the seat.

The rear seats are fairly comfortable also, if you can get back there.  I'm 5'10" and have a terrible time getting back there (that's why I hardly sit in it if I'm going to be sitting in the back).  For most two-doors, the front seats usually fold and slide forward atleast six inches or more to give you additional clearance to get to the back.  On this vehicle, no such luck.  You get the fold, but only an additional one to two inches at most.  Once back there, you sit in what feels like a tomb.  The interior is black and the windows do not let in much light, so you sit there feeling like you're sitting in church waiting for confession.

There is not much cargo space behind the second row seats.  You wouldn't use this to haul a baby around, but if you did, you'd have a hard time fitting a stroller back there.  You do have additional storage space if you fold the second row seat and push it forward.  Doing this more than double the storage space.  One problem with cargo space restriction is the spare tire.  It's a donut spare that fits inside a cavity on the rear door.  This spare tire storage takes up a lot of interior space, plus it's also the cause of a great deal of lose of rear view vision.  Looking out the rear window, you could not see a small child (4' tall) walking across.  I've found this very dangerous, as my brother-in-law has backed up into plenty of cars, both in the parking lot and while driving.

The rear quarter window and rear window are basically useless.  You'll have to drive this with the same mentality as driving a cargo van with metal side panels.  Just use the side mirrors and hope nobody is back there.

The car has this Traction-On-Demand (TOD) mode which I believe transfers power to the wheels the computer detects are slipping.  There is a small meter on the dash that indicates which wheels are getting power, and it looks like a 80/20 (rear/front) split during normal driving.  I haven't driven the car when I've noticed any shift in distribution, so I can't be sure how this works.

Having done some maintenance on the car and coming up on over three years, and almost 60,000 miles on the car, the reliability is questionable at best.  The car had to have the front, driver's side suspension replaced at around 32,000 miles because it broke.  I'm not sure if it was really the car itself, or my brother-in-law's driving, but it broke.  Both front headlight seals started to loosen and flip off around 35,000 miles.  The car started burning oil around 30,000 miles (it eats almost one quart per 3,000 mile oil change).  The only good thing about the oil is that the engine uses the same filter as my Honda, so I use my Honda filters on it.

I've read how the ride is smooth for this 'type' of vehicle.  I'm not sure what they were comparing the ride relative to, a Mac Truck or a dumpster, but this car is anything but smooth.  Because of the heavy duty suspension that this car has, it is great for off-roading, but not for highway driving, which I believe most drivers will use this vehicle for.  I've driven it on the smoothest and roughest highways around here and you feel every little bump and imperfection of the road.  This vehicle drives exactly like it looks, a TRUCK.  You'll never mistaken this for a car.

Power is adequate.  I believe the official numbers are 8.9 seconds to 60 mph, with a 3.5 liter V-6 engine with 215 hp.  Good numbers for a vehicle that's probably over two tons.  It's a gas guzzler though.  On one trip to Atlantic City, we only averaged about 15 miles on the highway.

Resale value is not great, but not terrible either.  The current retail price for the vehicle is approximately $17,000, which is a 43% drop from original price.  My RX300 which has about the same mileage and is also a 1999 has only dropped 30% in value.

Finally, I guess if you've paid over $30,000, you'll probably love this vehicle more than if you were someone who occasionally drove and maintained it.
