            I bought a 93 used in 1995 and have since put over 100,000 miles on it.  The only major expense has been tires and brakes (normal consumables)  The clutch is getting a little long in the tooth, (I have a rare 5-speed) but that is to be expected at 110k.  Otherwise the paint looks great and the leather is fine.  I very much recommend this car to anyone who wants a sporty luxury small car.  The suspension is a little stiff for some (this is a performance vehicle) so don't expect the washed out Lexus type ride.  There is a good reason that this vehicle is always in the top 5 used cars by Consumers Reports.<br>
