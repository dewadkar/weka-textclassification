            I looked at all 4x4 &quot;small&quot; pickup trucks and although this one is slightly more expensive it is the one I choose.  It has all of the features,V6, automatic power everything, cd tape, 31&quot; tires, club cab and cruise control.  The only one that came close was the the Nissan Crew Cab Frontier, but the wouldn't budge on the price and I understand that Renault just bought Nissan and I am not very impress by them.  I plan to use this truck to tow and 4x4 on the beach for surf fishing on the outer banks of NC.  The dealership really worked with me to purchase this truck.  Given the reliability of Toyota I plan for this to be my son's first vehicle and he in 6 years old.  It does drive like a truck and sits very high.  If you want a dependable 4x4 that you plan to keep for a long time spend the extra $2,000-$3,000, if you are looking for a less expensive SUV this isn't the vehicle for you it is a well built well appointed truck.  An example of the detail, while purchasing the road hazard warranty on the $130 (to replace) 31&quot; tires the shop man stated &quot;wow those are really nice shock.&quot;<br><br>
