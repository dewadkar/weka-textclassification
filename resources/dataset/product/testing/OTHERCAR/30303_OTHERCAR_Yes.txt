            It would have to take some truck for us to switch from Ford to Chevy, my husband grew up in a Ford family, I married a Ford man, now we own our first Chevy and LOVE it!!

I balked for 2 years at getting rid of my Eddie Bauer Expedition, I thought nothing would compare.  You can see that by my review of some time ago!!

The ride in the Avalanche is incredible!!  It is like riding in a luxury car.  The leather seating is so comfortable.  It really seats 5 very comfortably.  It is well laid out and handles like a dream.  I did not realize what a tank the expedition was until I drove this.

The only thing I miss is my 6 cd changer and the sound system in the expedition.  They could have maybe put a premium sound system in the Z71 package.  I guess I was spoiled by the MACH I system in the expo, but the one in the Chevy really stinks especially if you like to crank it!

The cool little extras like on-star and the neat buttons that replace your garage door opener.  They also have buttons that can be programmed if you have one of those remote home centers that open doors and turn on lights.

We find the "Change for a Dollar" system to be workable.  We were told by our dealer to not expect a water tight system.  It does get wet down both sides of the bed a stripe about an inch wide.  A bag for the 3 covers comes with the truck.  The neat little cargo bins that are lockable outside the bed work well too!

Seeing out the back window is not very good, my husband who is long a fan of side mirrors feels it is not an issue, for myself it is.  I am very nervous in reverse, which has upset people in the local mall parking lot waiting for my space.  It is more children I am worried about than other cars, you would not see a small child, that is a fact.  Hubby says it is no different than driving any other full size pick-up.  Also, at night, the dash lights reflect an exact reverse image of your dash on the rear window, which is a vision problem for me.  I just turn the lights down and that solves the problem, I am used to the low light at this point.

With the not very snowy winter we have had, we have not had a chance to try it in the snow.  We have had it off road taking clients to see properties though.  It's 4WD system works well.

We own a small construction company and are enjoying the versatility of this vehicle.  It works for our company as well as our family. It does get a truck designation. All in all a wonderful vehicle, which I love.  Sorry Ford, but my hubby's next pick-up is a Chevy!!
