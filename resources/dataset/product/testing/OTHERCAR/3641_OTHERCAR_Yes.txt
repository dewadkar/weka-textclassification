            My boyfriend recently leased a 2000 Jetta GLX. While I absolutely love his car, I knew I couldn't afford anything quite that expensive when it came time for me to buy. I've always had Volkswagens, though, and love them for their sportiness, sleek interiors and dependability. So, when I went looking for a car I naturally drove straight to a Volkswagen dealer that had a good selection of used cars on its lot.

I hadn't thought of buying a Golf until I saw it sitting there among the Jettas. A black '97 with black leather interior, only 31,000 miles and a sunroof. As I slid into the front seat, I knew I had to drive it, just to see what it felt like. Then, I thought, I can choose from the green, grey and red Jettas parked all around me.

Needless to say, I drove away that evening with the black Golf. I was so enamored with how great it drove that I turned the wrong way out of the lot and continued driving for about 3 miles in the opposite direction that I wanted to be going. I've had the car for a couple of months now, and I have had no regrets at all about buying it. Jettas are great cars, but if you want something just as nice for a little less money, Golfs are a great alternative. They are not that much smaller inside, either. Once you get in the car and turn and look around, they seem bigger than they look. And the fold-down back seats make great use of the space for carrying loads of whatever you have to transport.

And believe it or not, sometimes my boyfriend even wants to drive it!<br><br>
