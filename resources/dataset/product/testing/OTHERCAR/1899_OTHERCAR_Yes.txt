            All right...it ain't the top of the line...but it is a good point and shoot camera for the price...and VERY easy to use.  The perfect &quot;grab shot&quot; camera to haul around in the van to the kid's soccer games and birthday parties or in the boat, where you wouldn't want to risk a more expensive unit.

I like the simple optical viewfinder, which is very bright.  I've had too many cameras with dark viewfinders and I hate  them.  Agfa did great job of making SEEING what you are shooting easy.

Unlike the high end cameras, you don't need a Ph D. to learn how to use this little gem.  It has well marked control buttons and an easy to read and UNDERSTAND control panel that'll tell you flash and battery status, self timer status, image quality, remaining number of frames, etc..

It comes with 2mb of internal memory, onboard flash, and a TWAIN driver that makes my downloads a snap.  

Switch hitter!  Yep, you can even convert it to a line powered Webcam simply by plugging in the included USB cable.  Cool!   When I upgrade, I know where this baby's going...to a Webcam application on top of my computer.  Nice idea, Agfa!

Image quality on this snap camera is good - but, remember, it is fully automatic and has a fix lens, so no macro or zooming here.
