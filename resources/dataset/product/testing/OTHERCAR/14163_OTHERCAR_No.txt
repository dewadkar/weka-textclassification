            Some of my friends have this massive machine they are rich spoiled and all have the money to afford this machine. I must be honest i love it to death only if we are going off-road though...Why? duhh..this beast is crazy it takes on any terrain and gets u out of anywhere..except the ocean!! But this is definitely not for people who never see:

1- Snow
2- Rough terrain on the way to work
3- A small stream crossing the road
4- $$$$ in their bank account

1- the snow is no biggy for this thing it just snowed here where i live and me and some friends went out and never got stuck. i tried to go where we went in my jeep and well it just really wasnï¿½t the same!!

2- If you are a business man or woman and take this machine to work you are a wack...unless you work in the smokies

3- Streams and rivers are no problem either just don't go too deep because you might find your self swimming with the fishies.

4- My friends are rich (those punks) but why waste your money on this when you can get a porche or some sweet race car. Because how often do you go off road.

warning: this machine is for off road nuts or rich fools who want to have a safe winter
