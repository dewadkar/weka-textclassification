            Married and 30 years old with children, it was time to trade in the 1996 Ford Escort. Having been very well served over six years of ownership of the Escort, I intended to stay "brand loyal" and perused the local Ford lots for a new Taurus. 

The test drive of the Taurus was unpleasant to say the least. The incessant yammering of the salesman (who insisted on being with me on the test drive) combined with a very mediocre showing from the car left me headed for the Chevy dealership. 

After deciding that I would rather have lunch money than drive around in the hot new Impala, the salesman tossed me the keys to a 2002 Malibu. 

The ride was pleasant and quiet. The stereo system was robust and filled up the roomy interior nicely. The car effortlessly climbed a mountain highway often giving subtle hints of the old Chevrolet grumble from its engine.  

Although the average American pie body style seemed very camouflaged before the urban/highway backdrop, the savings and quality were unmatched by the Taurus. Several hours later I was quite figuratively and literally sold on the Malibu. 

Writing this review is a bit difficult for me, as longevity is by far the most important attribute of a vehicle. With only 2,000 miles and one long road trip under its belt the Malibu is still untried and unproven in the proverbial test of time. 

I feel obligated to do this since it is a "review" so here goes;

Favorite Attributes of the 2002 Malibu:

Value/price

Interior space, especially the headroom, as I am 6'1" tall and able to wear a baseball cap while driving (a luxury not to be had in the Escort). 

Keyless entry, power windows and locks. 

Cruise control is easily accessed via the steering wheel. 

The CD player is a nice standard option and is complimented by a quality sound system. 

Things I might change about the new Malibu:

For some reason I believed that folding rear seats were very common standard feature, hence did not look for this during my inspection of the vehicle. A very unpleasant surprise. 

Still unable to figure out a few of the equalizer presets on the stereo...and I am computer guy. I dare say that this could be a bit more user friendly.

Probably could do a little better on the gas mileage as I only seem to get around 26-28 mpg on the highway.

Last word, took my father for a ride and he loves the Malibu, scary. This car is certainly a throwback to the old days of your father's Chevrolet.
