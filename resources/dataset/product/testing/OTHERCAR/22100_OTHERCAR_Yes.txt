            That's what I wrote a while back. Now I would like to retort to my own review. 

Don't throw away your film camera yet...

Beautiful pictures, taken by this camera, uploaded to a site like ophoto.com, and then printed on a high-quality photo paper make DC 215 a perfect substitute for a regular 35 mm/APS camera.
[quality is not that great. colors are blurry]
This camera is sleek, easy to operate, a great travel companion.
[yeah, it just eats AA'a like crazy]

 The zoom function lets you take close-ups and panoramic pictures with the same quality. The cable that is provided lets you upload the pictures to a harddrive, and then they can be used in e-mails, etc. I don't use the cable because I go an PCMCIA adaptor which takes Compact Flash cards which I can insert into my Powerbok, and I can simply drag the pictures to my harddrive. The camera comes with 4MB memory card which is pretty pitiful-only 16 high quality pictures will fit on it. The lower quality pictures don't look as impressive-the colors seem artificial, and the pictures, if printed, look aweful. The highest quality pictures (each taking about 250K) are of decent quality and look excellent when printed.

[they still do not look as good as regular film prints]

 So, buy a bigger card (16MB or 32 MB), and you will be safe.
The camera is a battery hog. If you travel, make sure you take a lot of batteries along with you.
The LCD is helpful-it allows you to preview the pictures taken and instantaneously delete the ones that you don't like.
The camera is a good first digital camera-combination of price and features seem to be a good combination for the beginner. If you are a professional photographer, or want more capabilities, look at more expensive models. 
[actually, of you are not only a professionla photographer but someone who wants quality, look for 2 megapixel cameras that come with rechargeable batteries]

Alas, I sold it on ebay. Now to bigger and greater things. Read my review on Canon G1-unbelievable!<br><br>
