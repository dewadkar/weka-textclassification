            My family and I own a 1996 Saturn SL1 and we love it!  We bought it used from a Chrysler dealer in October of 1998 with 40,000 miles on it and now it has 75,000 nearly trouble free miles.  When we purchased this car we were actually in the market for a used minivan and then we saw this car and fell in love with it!  

Since we did not buy it through a Saturn retailer, we were not able to experience the &quot;Saturn Retail Experience&quot; but are aware of it.  However I have visited two Saturn retailers in my area and I was treated with kindness, respect and dignity, and the people were pleasant as well as honest, not the phony types you would find in a normal dealership.  
     
The only trouble that we have had with this car was having to replace the transmission at about 60,000 miles.  Other than that, and routine maintenance this car is trouble free!  For it's size, this car has a smooth ride (I happen to think that it has a smoother ride than a Ford Windstar) and is comfortable.  The seats are supportive and comfortable and they aren't as close to the ground as other cars.  

The rear seat is wide, but leg room is a little cramped for taller people, but it is much more comfortable than a Ford Escort or Dodge/Plymouth Neon's rear seat.  Ergonomics are great in this car, everything is easy to reach and simple to use.  

I also can't believe the amount of comments I have received on this car, especially on the polymer panels, how amazing it is when you hit one it just bounces right back!  Even when it is filthy, people seem to like it!  The polymer panels just go along with the extremely high level of quality on the exterior as well as the interior.  As far as the engine, this car has a peppy 1.9 Liter 100-Horsepower 4-cylinder engine that is surprisingly powerful.  

The only thing I don't like about this car is that the engine is kind of noisy.  I am used to driving older cars so I have no problem with a noisy engine, but other people may have a problem with that so I thought it would be good to include that information.  
     
This car handles very well and is surprisingly agile.  It is powerful and comfortable at the same time.  People who need a small yet roomy car, or need a powerful yet economical car should buy a Saturn SL1.  People who hate noise should not buy a Saturn SL1.  Overall, I think that this is a great car and I HAVE recommended it to many people.
