            I bought my 1996 Dodge Stratus as a 2 year old car. I was immediately in love! It was the base model with a 2.4L 4-banger. I was never more satisfied with a small engine like that. 

Well, a week after I bought it with only 39,000 miles on it I noticed an oil leak. The head gasket was replaced and a mechanic said, they are already coming back with leaks, I won't be suprised if yours does too!
So, at 75,000 miles I'm zooming down the highway and all of a sudden I see white smoke in back of me and it's so thick I can't see through it. 
I pulled over only to find out the engine caught fire. Luckily I had a fire extinguisher on hand. I called my mechanic and he said, &quot;why didn't you let it burn!&quot; I could kill myself, for not letting it. 

Chrysler said they would pay for everything and a new head gasket. Thank god, although I wanted to leave it with a big lemon painted on the side in front of Chrysler Corp. That would have made my day!

Now my rack and pinion steering has gone out. Which I hear is a Chrysler faux pas also, along with bad gaskets!

I love everything about this car except for those few things. 

Anybody else interested better keep a few things in mind before they buy this model....

If you have anyone over 150 lbs. sitting in back you will feel it like you were towing a horse!

Tint those huge windows! My credit card was lying out on my seat and warped! This car is all windows!

Whatever you do don't buy a '96 model! Gaskets are not cheap!
