            I was quite surprised to end up with a Neon and here is how it happened.

I was driving a Dodge caravan and had good luck with it, so I went back to Dodge dealership when I started looking for a new car.  I only knew that I wanted to downsize and I wanted something good on gas.

I talked with the salesperson and stated my wants, a two wheel drive, antilocking brakes and good on gas.  He suggested the Neon and once I drove it, I really liked it.  It handles better than any car I have driven.  I feel like I am driving a sports car with the way it handles.  The wheel responds to any movement.  I am getting about 22 miles per gallon as I do alot of highway travel.

My Neon is only 3 months old.  Already I have received a recall on this vehicle.  It seems in Winter, the idle does not work properly and if not fixed, could cause accidents.  

The tires are Firestone which I was originally thrilled to have.  Now, they may be recalled.

It is not cold weather and my Neon is not idling properly.  It can go up to 10 mph on it's own.

Something is wrong with the exhaust system as the smell of exhaust is frequently strong in the car.

I did purchase an extended warranty so I am sure all these problems will be addressed and fixed.

As far as handling, price paid and gas mileage, I am satisfied with my purchase.
