            i bought my 89 chrysler lazer from a cousin, and now i know why he sold it. that car had to be the worst car i have ever owned!!!! i owned the car one year from when i bought it and it was only 3 years old when i got it with 20,000 miles on it. in the one year that i owned the car, i bet i replaced nearly every part in the car twice! i replaced parts i have never thought of replacing in a car before. i had to replace the car's computer, the power window switches, the power window motors, all the electrical stuff in the engine, coils, and coilwires, distributor cap, starter, alternator, the entire axel, the universal joints, the tirods,the entire power steering unit, the exhaust, the radiator, the heater core, the entire air conditioning unit. all i can say is that i'm glad my grandpa was a mechanic. i will not ever by another chrysler product after owning that car. i ended up just selling it to a junkyard for 50$<br><br>
