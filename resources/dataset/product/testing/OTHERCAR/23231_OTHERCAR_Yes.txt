            My Polaroid MP3 digital camera was a gift, so I had no choice in the buying process.  On sale, the camera cost $99, compared to the original price of $160+.  For a beginner, who has never operated a digital camera before, the Polaroid MP3 is a great choice. It is low in price and very easy to use. 
The instruction manual was very clear and concise.  I was up and shooting photos in a matter of minutes. 
The camera comes with one 16 MB memory card and runs on AA batteries, both of which are easy to change.
My camera came with a handy carrying case, one 16 MB memory card, cable to connect to the computer, and cables to view photos on the television, earphones, 4 AA batteries, and Polaroid PhotoMAX 4.0 software.  A great deal!
The software is very easy to use and the photos are a breeze to upload...just plug-in and click.
Now for the down-side... the flash takes a long time to juice up, and what you see in the view-finder is not what comes out on the photo.  The view finder is slightly off, so I have to adjust what I see in the finder to what I want to see on the photo.  I avoid this entirely by using the full color LCD monitor.  You can not take close-ups.  anything closer than two feet is fuzzy.  You have to have a very steady arm in order for the photos not to be out of focus.
I use my digital camera for photos of items I'm selling online and for quick picks to email Grandma.  If you are looking for high quality photos to print out, you might look elsewhere.  If you just want to have a little fun with a digital camera, you can't go wrong with the MP3.
Oh and did I mention you can download and listen to music too.  What a concept!
