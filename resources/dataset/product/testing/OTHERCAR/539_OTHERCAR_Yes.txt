            When it comes to the Hyundai Accent, it is all a matter of finding out whether and how the car performs on the road.  In addition, you want to take into consideration the earlier disappointments suffered by this Korean car manufacturer.  They push them to take a better look at their engineering components in order to improve and not repeat the same mistakes or refrain from fueling the perception that Ford's Nova had.  Most people came to see Hyundai as the company that rolls out unreliable and cheap vehicles in its early days.  <b>But, all of this perception thing will stay in the past.  The company made a change about face and started producing affordable vehicles that most parents and families can afford these days</b>

To tell you the truth, I won't hide my own preferences, discrimination, pre-judgements against this car.  I discouraged two friends of mine from buying a Huyndai Sonata back in 1998.  One of them did not heed my advice, went ahead with her purchase, and was big-time, very unsatisfied with her new vehicle.  I only saw her arrive at work in the car to see her calling AAA for assistance.  It broke down.  Her husband got mad at her for falling for the looks of the vehicle.  He bought her a different vehicle.  She appears happier now.  <i> Keep in mind that was the past.  The present looks better for the Hyundai company.  It appears to take into account the various consumers' complaints about dissatisfaction</i>

<b>I Advised &quot;Penny-pinche&quot; too parsimonious Irrigation Supervisor To Buy A Hyundai Accent.</b>

This friend of the family is so tight with his money that he just saves every penny he can.  How many of us envy his financial discipline!  He is known by everybody to buy old, used vehicles, get them working and use them for his transportation.  He finally decided to take advantage of the Accent.  The way I presented it to him was that it was cheap.  Things have to be cheap for him to even consider them.  I made all kinds of presentations and comparisons with vehicles in the Accent category.  I talked about the new Toyota Tercel comparison, for example. A few weeks aftewards, he went and purchased a 2000 Hyundai Accent.  So far, he appears to be happy with his vehicle.

<b>Longest Standard Warranty in the industry</b>

What truly got under my irrigation friend's skin is the warranty offered by the company.  100,000 miles 5-year bumper to bumper warranty!  It shows that Hyundai is willing to stand by their product.  In fact, that's the way it should have been for all car manufacturers.  Consumers should not have to be worried about having limited warranty after forking over so much money for these vehicles.  Any way, the base price of Hyundai Accent makes it very appealing to groups of people such as this supervisor. They would never have the courage to invest so much money into a new vehicle.  <b>Hyundai makes it possible for them.  It makes it possible for this irrigation foreman!</b>

<b>Let's take a deep look at the Accent itself</b>

With the 2-door L, 4-door GL, and 2-door GS, Hyundai is trying to bring quality products to the market.  The Hyundai Accent offers great gas mileage.  MPG (city/Hwy) 28/36.  It can seat 5 people.  Mommy, daddy, and the 2.5 kids can fit in it.  It is somewhat roommy both in the front and the rear.  It is being powered by 4 cylinder, 1.5 liter 92 horsepower engine.  While the styling of the Hyundai Accent is sharp and attractive, the ride can be a bit noisy when you hit the freeway.  Why?  It appears that the wall sheets are too thin.  In my opinion, they are very skinny.  However, the seats are comfy enough to allow you to travel to a long distance.  I drove this Accent on four occasions; I felt fine.  Well, of course, I had to fold myself in two to get in there.  As soon as I established myself in front of the wheel, I pushed back the seat.  I needed leg space.  For 6'4''people, you may want to think twice.  No matter, you will fit in the vehicle fine.  

<b>What else? Let's see the facts now</b>

If you know how to drive stick shift, you will save more on gas.  The irrigation supervisor bought a stick shift Accent.  The GS &amp; GL come with standard driver's seat folding armrest.  The option package equipment includes AM/FM stereo with CD, air conditioning and power windows, mirrors, door locks, carpeted floor mats, mud guards, trunk cargo net.

If you are not looking for luxury, the Accent is the vehicle for you.  If you want to stay within budget, it is for you too.  If you want to surprise your teenager who just wants a vehicle to go to the nearby community college, it can be his too.

Good luck selecting the one you like!
