                I just sold my 1999 CR-V LX 4WD after over a year of ownership. The seating position is very uncomfortable for anyone over 5'6". The seat is not high enough to allow for chair or truck-like seating and it is not low enough for sedan seating. The driver's side seat adjustments help some, but not enough,and there are no adjustments in the passenger seat. Also, to be close enough to the steering wheel for my arms to be comfortable, I had to scrunch up my legs. Extending my legs even a bit meant having to extend my arms straight out to reach the steering wheel. The seats themselves are tiny with no side support, so I felt like I was perched on the seat rather than seated, and around curves I had to brace myself to remain upright because the seats are completely flat. Sitting in the back seat is like sitting on a bench. Taking a long trip was a painful experience. 
    The CR-V handles more like a truck than a car. In addition, the car had a wobble when it accelerated in first gear. Honda's response was that all CR-V's have the wobble to some extent, that it has to do with the torque, and that this is "normal." It did not feel normal to me. When you floor the pedal in an emergency situation, there is a delay before the car accelerates which I found dangerous.  The loud revving upon acceleration at higher speeds is annoying.
    The car was difficult to park because the tire extends out further than the rear bumper so that you find yourself scrunching the car behind you with the tire before you tap it with your bumper, and there are blind spots.  he air-conditioning was really poor, even if you go through the steps Honda tells you (open the windows, cool the recirculating air, etc.)
    On the plus side, being higher up makes for great visibility, but it also makes you feel insecure, especially around curves.  The big windows are nice, but it also means the sun is beating down on you more, and the little visor doesn't help.
    I come from a Honda family and have owned Hondas for years.  This was a big disappointment.  And its resale value was not great.
