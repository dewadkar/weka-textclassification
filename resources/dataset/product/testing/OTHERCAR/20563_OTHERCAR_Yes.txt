            I drive 20,000-30,000 miles per year, so I need a comfortable, reliable car. The 1999 Acura Integra LS certainly fills the bill. I previously had a 1990 Integra that had 180,000 miles on it when a drunk driver totaled it. That car would have been good for at least another 50,000-100,000 miles. A car that lasts this long is a great value! Repair costs were low, because they're seldom needed. And although replacement parts (such as brake pads) are expensive, they' re very durable, so you total cost of ownership remains low. My old Acura ( may she rest in peace) still steered solidly and rode comfortably even at 180,000 miles. <br>The new 1999, redesigned Integra is even better. It's very stable through turns and it's low profile keeps it steady on the road. Even though my car is kept outside, it stays good-looking with an occasional wash and wax. It's a pleasure to drive and a comfortable ride. I fully expect this car to last over 200,000 miles. I don't enjoy driving, except when I'm driving my Acura.<br><br><br>
