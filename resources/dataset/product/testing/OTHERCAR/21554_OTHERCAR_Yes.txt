            This camera is great, I got it about a year ago and have not stopped using it.

First thing is the obvious, it's extremely small and convenient to carry on trips or anywhere.  But the great thing about it is that they it seems they did not have to give up features to go this small.

I don't want to give anyone the wrong impression, this is still a point and shoot camera, but it has many cool features that will give you enough control over the picture without taking a photo class.

I have been very impressed with the simplicity and quality of this camera.  I got my mom the S330 for Christmas this year (pretty much the same camera except it has a 3x optical zoom instead of the 2x, and it has an external speaker for your recorded movies and irritating clicking noises:)  My mom is far from technically minded but was able to take this out of the box and start taking pictures right away.

After using my moms S330, I have to say I like the S200 more.  On paper the difference in size is very marginal, but it just really seems much smaller when using it.

The movie feature will allow you to shoot short videos (30 seconds tops) which is a cool feature, but I definitely didn't buy it for that.  Great for sending grandparents movies of grandkids etc...

The battery life is decent (much improved over the previous versions of this camera thanks to the new and improved longer lasting bater that comes with this camera).  I would suggest that you buy another battery though, it's still a digital camera and uses alot of juice to power that little screen.

Overall, this camera has been great, I have never had any regrets buying this camera.  It is a perfect on the go camera that will get the job done.
