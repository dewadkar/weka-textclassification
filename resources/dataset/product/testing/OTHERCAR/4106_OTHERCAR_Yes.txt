            I was looking for a Monte Carlo.  Seemed that was the car I wanted to replace my dying Chevy.   Nothing in the lot appealed to me (I am not ready for red) so I was leaving when I spotted the Intrigue.  It has been so long since I looked at Oldsmobiles, I didn't recognize the symbol on the hood.
Salesmen took me over and I drove it..That was it!  I was taken.  The car has power when needed, runs like a charm (have owned it for 2 years with NO problems, even after my son decided to test drive it into a tree)and other than the normal maintenance has not cost a dime.
I now believe the Olds advertising which says &quot;This is not your father's Oldsmobile&quot;
The car is great for families, trunk room is spacious and have no trouble fitting golf clubs or other large items.  Oh Yes...My father could drive it as well!<br><br>
