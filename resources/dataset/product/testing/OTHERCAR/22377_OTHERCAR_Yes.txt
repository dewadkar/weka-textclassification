            I received this camera as a gift for my last birthday from my boyfriend.  After many problems with the store we were ordering from (which is a whole other story, completely unrelated to this camera), I finally had my gift.

Whoa!  I've never had a digital camera before, but being a photography student for the past 5 or so years, I quickly realized everything I'd be able to do with this camera.

Firstly, a knob lets you choose between taking different photos, according to taste and situation.
If you choose S-Prg, you can take photos depending on the situation, light, etc.  This allows for better nighttime photos, action, still life, and close-up pictures, and is also where the movie mode is.
The P function lets the camera choose the correct exposure for the photo.
A/S/M/My Mode lets you choose between Aperture Priority mode, Shutter Priority mode, Manual mode, and "My mode," in which you can change settings and save them for each use of the camera, even if turned off, to your own liking.
Then, of course, the Playback and Power selections on that dial.
But that isn't all!  The camera also has a nice, easy to use zoom function, located on the shutter, as a swivel-like dial.  If 3x optical zoom isn't enough, you can access the Mode Menu to enable the digital zoom.
Speaking of the mode menu.. Wow, I love this thing.  I don't use some options much, like the white balance, contrast, etc, but what I do like to use is the "function" option.  This option lets you choose between taking photos in black and white, sepia tone, "blackboard", "whiteboard", or no function (regular color).  These options can definitely lead to some fun experimenting.
There is also a self-timer, which can be very useful, as well as autofocus.

One thing I don't like much about this camera is the lens cap.  The camera came with a nice strap, which you attach the lens cap to, via a small cord.  The cap itself is one of those "press" ones, where you press in two pieces of plastic sticking out from either side, and this causes to lens cap to be knocked off very easily.

So here is where I tell an embarrassing story.  Well, one day over the summer, I went out to an amusement park with my boyfriend and new camera.  I left it in a high locker most of the day, as I wanted to go on rides, and I did not want to leave it on the side where my bag could've easily been snatched.  Anyway, as I went to take it out from the locker (and due to my sheer stupidity), I pulled out my bag, forgetting that I didn't zip it (duh.) and.. out flew my beautiful camera.  It did suffer a bit, the USB door that covers the USB connection did break off, and the flash timer got a bit messed up, so if I take automatic pictures inside, they don't come out well.  Anyway, that doesn't bother me much, since I like to use the manual setting without flash (most of the time - honestly I also haven't taken advantage of the warranty!), but know that you should be very careful.

A third (and last) thing I don't like about this camera is that it came with only a 16 MB Smart Media card.  Okay, so it's not THAT small, and I don't know, maybe the camera isn't sold with that card anymore, but if you want to take photos of the best quality available with this camera (3.2MP), it's just not big enough.  I went out and bought a 128 MB Smart Media card, and it's MUCH much better that way.

All in all, this camera is definitely worth buying for someone new to digital photography, or even someone completely new to photography, since it's really easy to use.  Just make sure that you don't take it along on a trip that might cause damage to it! :)
