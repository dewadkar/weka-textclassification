            I purchased the Polaroid pdc 640 on February 25,2000. I was looking to get the most pixels at the lowest cost. I found this camera at our new wal mart. The price was great (179.00) and the pixels were in the middle range where you are able to print a nice picture up to 8 X 10. I have taken about 20 pictures with it so far. And they all seem to look excellent when I print them out on my printer. They also look good when I send them through my E-Mail.

I do wish though that I would have known that there was another kit that had the floppy disc adapter because I would have purchased that instead. I bought the digital camera creative kit, which came with the PC cable where you plug it in to your serial port. So I wound up having to install a second serial to be able to download my pictures and use my mouse at the same time.

The only things that I dislike about the camera is .... it does not have any zoom capabilities and the PC cable you download with to your computer seems to be made too small where you plug it in to the camera. I have to mess with the plug for a while until I can get a good connection.

Other than that it seems to be a very economical camera that takes great photos.<br><br>
