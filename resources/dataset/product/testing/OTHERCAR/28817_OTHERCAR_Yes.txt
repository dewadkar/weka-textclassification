Kodak DC210 plus with included software. Came with serial and RF cable. AC adapter, batteries Picture Easy software. 8MB Flashcard

Installation
Very easy to install. Insert the CD and away you go! Install Picture Easy and mounter software. 

Camera Performance
Picture taking is a snap, just point and shoot. Fixed focus lens eliminates a step, but this can be a bad thing! Objects at a distance are somewhat fuzzy, this may be due to overly aggressive compression or the fixed focus. Works best indoors with the flash but only at a distance of about 10 feet.
If you intend to use regular batteries then you may as well buy stock in Duracell. My advice is buy re-chargeable NI-MH or NI-CAD batteries. This camera can eat batteries at the rate of 4AA for 75 pictures depending on use of preview or not.

Quality of Prints
I have made prints using several Web companies with good success. Beware of anything larger than 5x7, it will look pretty fuzzy with this camera.
I suggest getting a Nikon Coolpix.

Software
Included software is ok for basic image manipulation but is no Adobe Photoshop. The twain interface is very slow due to the serial connection and suggest an investment in a good card reader.

Overall
I would consider this if you are looking for a basic digital camera for occasional use. I have used this for over a year now and am happy with it's performance since I don't demand the highest quality prints.
