            I got this camera, because I was looking for an inexpensive digital camera. You get what you pay for. 

It is pretty easy to use, since there aren't many options to get in the way of taking pictures..

This is basically your point and shoot digital camera. You can turn on the flash, have it auto, or leave it off.. and there is a timer.. that pretty much sums up the features of this camera.

It takes standard AA batteries, which is good, you don't have to spend a ton of money on a 'camera' battery which can be expensive.

The photo software it comes with is not bad, again, not a lot of frills, but if you were looking for a professional looking software interface, you wouldn't spend $50 on a digital camera. It is easy to transfer the pictures from the camera to your PC so you can e-mail them or what ever you have in mind for them..
