            I just purchased a new Chevy Impala LS 3 days ago.  I did have a Ford F150 supercab pickup, which was very nice, but I decided I wanted a car again.  After much research, I decided on the Impala.  This car has everything a person could want.  Heated leather seats, trip computer, decent sized engine, excellent styling.  This car hugs the road like no car I have ever driven.  I have taken curves in this car at speeds I would never have thought possible in other vehicles I've driven, with little body roll.  The only real problem I have with the car at this point is that I don't have enough time to drive it as much as I would like to.  It's that much fun to drive.  

Anyone who wants a practical car, with a lot of amenities and sporty styling, at a decent price, need look no further than the Impala.<br><br>
