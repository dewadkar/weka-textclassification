            The Pontiac Trans Sport Van is somewhat of a good/bad vehicle. One good thing is that it has two rear sliding doors.  It also has front wheel drive, and where I live front wheel drive is a life saver in the snow and ice.  The removable rear seats are very helpful when you have pets, or lots of cargo.  It has plenty of power to tow a trailer, boat, or jet ski.  It has a very sleek, stylish look ,and is good on any road or highway, and long distances.  On the other hand, I have had numerous problems with it.  The caliper on the disc brakes stuck.  Then the locks in the back do not work at all.  When the air conditioner went out last week, I took it in to the shop, and they still don't have the parts, so all that I can conclude is that the parts are somewhat difficult to obtain.  In its defense, it comes with a generous 3 year 60,000 mile warranty.  It is a descent vehicle, but kind of a problem. <br><br>
