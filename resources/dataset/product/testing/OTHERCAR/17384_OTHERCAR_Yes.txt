            		This car is a dream come true! Muscle-car performance, show car good looks, and Japanese reliability, all in an affordable package.  I recently purchased a brand-new black GSX (automatic transmission), and I love it! I get looks no matter where I go, the grocery store, the car wash, even to unlock the car in the parking lot.
	 There are very few gripes with this car, mostly related to visibility. If you are shorter, seeing out of the front windshield and rear quarters(for passing) will be difficult. Also, the high rear spoiler may limit your view.  But these are minor flaws with an otherwise wonderful car.
	If you are looking to transport more than two adults and their SMALL children, then you should probably pass on this car, as it really is a two seater. Room for luggage/stuff is surprisingly good, since the hatchback and fold-down rear seats allow you to play around with the configuration.
	I also looked at the Honda Prelude and Mercury Cougar, and this car had better acceleration, handling, and overall comfort of ride. It was tad bit more expensive than the Prelude, and significantly more so than the Cougar, but in my humble epinion, very much worth it. The only drawback being that this car requires premium fuel, versus the regular/midgrade for the others. But what is a few bucks a weeks for the car of your dreams?
	If I am ever feeling down, all I have to now is get in my car and look for open road.<br><br>
