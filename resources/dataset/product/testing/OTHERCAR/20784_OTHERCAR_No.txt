            Since going through high school, I have owned two Chevy Blazers. I like their body type, that &quot;truck&quot; ride and their dependability over a variety of surfaces. 

Driving a Blazer is an empowering experience. It's a great feeling to be up higher than a standard car, and in the event that you have to navigate any treacherous terrain, you know that it'll be there for you. 

Pre 1995 models definitely ride like &quot;trucks&quot; meaning, don't expect to feel like you're in a Mercedes...or heck, even a Camry. Since they began to put the Vortec engine in (around '92) acceleration has been great. But as with all SUV's the Blazer's cornering ability is not quite good.

Gas mileage is decent for a truck, and you can fit a lot of junk in the back by folding down the rear seat.

You may have heard rumors of frequent electrical problems. Unfortunately, they are true. In both my 1986 and 1993 Blazers, such problems arose. They typically materialize in the form of failed power windows and door locks. It is possible to lock/unlock doors w/out power, but the windows will not budge when not functioning. 

Most pre-1992 models will konk out on you before reaching 100k miles. It doesn't matter how well you take care of them. My only advice would be: If you're buying a pre-1992 model, go with the 4.3 liter engine. The 2.8L version is too small for the truck and is known unaffectionately as the &quot;death rattle engine&quot; by many truck aficionados . This term comes from the frequent engine knocking that all of these older trucks fall to sooner or later. 


All in all, the Chevy Blazer S-10 is a fun truck to own. But I would advise against buying a used one. Hopefully Chevy has ironed out all its problems and you'll be safe with a '99 or 2000 model. I wouldn't recommend the vehicle for families with children, since it's a pain to get in and out of the back seat and in case of emergency, seconds count.
However, it's a fine machine for college kids and single folks who have the need to constantly move stuff around.
