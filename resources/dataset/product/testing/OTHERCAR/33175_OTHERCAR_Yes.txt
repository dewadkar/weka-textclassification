<b>History</b>
Sometimes in automotive history, a carmaker will create a jewel, a masterpiece that still impresses after many years. I am reviewing a car today that is very special in my mind and also in that of many others. That car is the Mercedes W124 E-Class, and in particular the 300E model.

The Mercedes W124 E-Class was released between 1986 and superseded the ailing but innovative W123. The W124 was seen to be a very important model, as it was more upmarket than the 190-Class (C-Class equivalent) but considerably cheaper than the massive S-Class. It was the car that would suit the executive, the retiree or the family man. Over the years the W124 sold exceptionally well, finally discontinued in 1995. The long 10-year life span of the car as well as the large number of buyers is a credit to the superlative nature of the W124.

Yet it wasn&#146t that the W124 was just value for money that made it such a success. It was a variety of things. The fact that the car was superbly engineered, contained up-to-date yet useful technology and conveniences, but in my own opinion it was the continued refinement of Mercedes strengths such as quality, road holding and performance. It is these strengths, which lead me to think that the W124 is possibly one of the great post-war sedans. The W124 has a loyal group of fans, evident with the large number of fan sites. On this website there are a large number of W124 reviews and while many, if not most are not too detailed you do get the feeling that almost every owner is very happy with their experience W124.

A note to buyers: The W124 series changed their naming method in 1993. Originally it was the engine capacity (eg. 400E &#150 4.0 litre engine) followed by class designation but in an effort to prevent confusion between classes Mercedes put the class designation before the engine capacity (400E became E400) which turned out to be a confusing process in itself considering the number of updates that happened over the years. A confusing set of changes for the better.

My wife and I have owned two W124 class cars, a 300CE and another 300CE when we moved to Australia. I have a number of friends with 300E cars and I am also a  member of the German Mercedes-Benz Club.


<b>Appearance</b> 7.5/10
The W124 came in a variety of models and three distinct body styles. There was a four-door sedan (most popular), a coupe and a wagon. All of these were based on the sedan variant, which in itself was very elegantly styled. The W124 is not styled to turn heads, but if you take a closer look you realise that the car is the epitome of conservative yet tasteful design. The traditional Mercedes-Benz grille was present and the car really does look like a smaller version of the expensive S-Class. In earlier models indicator lenses were orange but were updated to a much cleaner and clearer look on 1993 models with clear indicator lenses.

The most elegant looking W124 is undoubtedly the coupe, with the sweeping roofline and pillarless windows adding to an airy look. Unusually for a coupe the rear windows can retract. In 1990 the car was updated to include colour co-ordinated skirts, which further made for an elegant look. The alloy wheels fitted to all W124 cars really complement the style of the car. I would avoid any aftermarket fitments as the elegant look of the car is lost.

While the W124 is no supermodel compared to current day Mercedes-Benzes such as the SL-Class it still has an undeniable elegance, which I think would impress almost anyone (with the possible exception of the wagon).


<b>Interior and Accommodation</b> 33/40
<b><I>Quality</b></I> 5/5
The W124 was the &#147last of the line&#148 Mercedes-Benz cars that had the feeling of being hewn from a single iron block. Every other Mercedes model since has not been on par. In the early 1990s Mercedes began to realise that they could not over engineer their cars to remain financially viable and compete with other manufacturers regarding pricing. In my native Germany many taxi drivers still drive the W124 because it is bullet proof. The newer cars &#150 particularly the trim do not stand up to the every day wear and tear of the constant passengers. 

The trim on the W124 is second to none. Early models were fitted with MB-Tex, which is extremely good quality vinyl that almost feels almost leather like. Cars fitted with MB-Tex will still look brand new! Later models and certainly the more expensive models were fitted with excellent leather trim that has remained soft throughout the years. It won&#146t wear as well as the MB-Tex but it is real leather after all. Rubbers and plastics were of the highest quality, and even today you won&#146t find many cracks (if any at all). Panel gaps are minute on both interior and exterior which give a much more solid feel and look. The Mercedes-Benz door slam is still on my wife&#146s car, even though the car is now 10 years old. Zebrano wood trim is fitted to the interior of earlier W124s and it has been known to discolour but the quality is so good that it does little to discredit the rest of the rest of the interior. Later cars are fitted with burl walnut.

<b><I>Ease of Use</b></I> 5/5
The W124 used the Mercedes&#146 traditional centre console and transmission tunnel. The centre console is a model of glorious simplicity. A beautifully polished piece of wood extends from below the ventilation vents all the way to the centre front armrest. Integrated into the dashboard are all major controls for climate control and sound system, as well as a few other simple buttons for miscellaneous functions such as rear headrest release, electric windows etc. This car was conceived a long time before GPS became standard fitment!

<b><I>Seating</b></I> 4/5
For those of you who are wondering, the W124 does have those rather firm seats, which many Americans seem to loathe. No they can&#146t be liked to rock benches or torture seats as I have read in other reviews. The firmness is prevalent for a reason &#150 to provide unparalleled support and comfort over long distances and it is in this respect that the W124 delivers! The seat is shaped and designed well &#150 catering for various frames. Seat heating was an option except on the 400E and 500E (both of which are exceptionally rare). Electric seating was standard on the 300E and all models above however after 1990 I think electric seating was fitted to all models. Seating is adjusted via the usual Mercedes seat adjustment control located on the door of both driver and front passenger. When a certain area of that controller is pushed, the seat moves accordingly to where you have pushed. The driver had 2-position memory. 

<b><I>Technology</b></I> 4.5/5
The W124 doesn&#146t have any groundbreaking technology by today&#146s standard however it must be remembered that it is a 17-year old design. Many of the technologies that were fitted however were safety orientated. At the time the car had ABS brakes &#150 a milestone in safety and even today lesser vehicles are only getting this feature as standard. SRS airbags became standard fitment once the W124 got its mid-cycle update in 1991. Lastly ASR (Anti Slip Regulation) was fitted to later models as the Mercedes traction control system..

<b><I>Heating and Ventilation</b></I> 4.5/5
Mercedes has always fitted superb climate control systems to their cars &#150 as is usually a European tradition (with the exception of Italian cars). All W124s that I have driven have had separate driver and passenger temperature settings however this is obviously not the case in the United States. All cars I have seen there have only had one temperature zone so it might be an admission on US specification. The system is highly efficient and through my own experience it has remained so throughout the years. If you operate the system weekly it keeps all seals in good condition and thus prevents cooling gases from leaking. Other owners have complained of difficulties and problems with the climate control however I think it is an infrequent problem. 

<b><I>Sound System</b></I> 3/5
This sound system was a weakness of the interior in my own opinion. The  W124 existed when a Mercedes-Benz option list was longer than the standard equipment. You had to pay quite considerably for a CD auto-changer. The system has 6 speakers &#150 sufficient but nothing compared to today&#146s efforts. Nevertheless compared to other cars of the day the system is still good and in most cases the sound system has most probably been upgraded with an aftermarket fitment as is commonplace these days.

<b><I>Safety and Security</b></I> 4/5
As I mentioned before, the W124 class have a driver&#146s airbag after 1991 and a passenger side airbag after June 1994. ABS brakes and traction control are also fitted. Most of your safety however will come from the solid body, which many buyers consider a top priority when buying a Mercedes. No alarm system is present however it was an option. An immobiliser was fitted to later models and central locking to all models.

<b><I>Storage and Space</b></I> 3/5
Interior storage is sufficient, but not abundant. There are no cup holders and rear seat space is only average (which is made up for by rear seat comfort). Front door pockets, rear seatback pockets and console storage are the only storage areas on the interior. The large boot that has a good opening and shape makes up for any inadequacies on the interior. The coupe is slightly smaller than the sedan in the rear but still adequate for most trips.


<b>Engine and Handling</b> 16.5/20
<b><I>Engine and Performance</b></I> 7/10
There were a number of engine choices in the sedan available at different times. E= Sedan CE= Coupe TE= Wagon
<b>Capacity			Model			Years Manufactured</b>
2.3 (Straight Six) - 		 	230E 			1986-1993			
2.6 (Straight Six) -  			260E Later 300E 2.6 		1988-1992		                  
2.8 (Straight Six) -  			300E 2.8/300TE 2.8		1993			
3.0 (Diesel)          -			300D Later E300D		1986-1993
3.0 (Straight Six)  			300E/300CE/300TE		1986-1990			
3.0 (24 Valve Straight Six) June 		300E-24V/300CE-24V/300TE	1990-1993
3.2 (Straight Six)                 		E320/E320C		1993-1995
4.2 (V8)		         		400E later E400		1991-1995
5.0 (V8)		         		500E later E500		1991-1994

As you can see there is a large variety of engines to choose from depending on which model that you choose. The original 3.0 straight six (135kW) is not excessively powerful but has the smoothest, most seamless delivery of performance out of all the engines. The 3.0 24 Valve (167kW) is significantly more powerful offering better performance however it is not as smooth as the original. The 2.3 and 2.6 (121kW) litre engines really are not up to the job of pulling the weighty chassis of the W124 so I would recommend you avoid them if you can. The diesel engine really is quite a gem if you want a diesel. It has none of the associated odours or refinement problems usually associated with such an engine. Be prepared to crawl along in the city however, the Diesel isn&#146t exactly blistering. I have not tested either the 4.2 or 5.0 as both are exceptionally rare. The 5.0 were tuned in conjunction with Porsche and are a real sports sedan &#150 maybe the first proper Mercedes performance sedan built to compete with the likes of the BMW M5. The sedans and wagons have a four-speed automatic transmission, which can be at times a little reluctant to shift upwards, the coupe however has a 5-speed auto which is superb &#150 making use of all the engine&#146s power with a first gear that has an exceptionally short ratio.

<b><I>Handling</b></I> 9.5/10
I think that this is where the W124 series of cars truly shine. A 300E feels more sporting to drive than the larger Mercedes models. It corners extremely well, has a tight turning circle, nicely weighted power steering and sensational brakes. Even badly corrugated Australian roads don't unsettle its composure. In overall poise, the W124 Mercedes probably had no peer in 1986. But it is the combination of bank-vault build quality and this superb ride and handling that really sets the car apart from its contemporaries and makes it such a desirable purchase even though the oldest models are nearing on 17 years of age and with the odometer nearing 250,000 km. Ride and handling are superb and this trait is spread throughout all W124s. Unlike many European cars, the W124 is unfussed by appalling roads, soaking up huge bumps disdainfully. 

<b>Ownership</b> 8/10
<b><I>Insurance</b></I> 4/5
Insurance on any W124 should be reasonably cheap. The fact that there are a large number of them as well as the fact that they are now no longer brand new cars should ease the pain of insurance. In Australia we pay AUD$1040 for our car to be comprehensively insured.

<b><I>Maintenance</b></I> 4/5
Maintenance for the W124 can be approached in 3 ways as with most other cars. You can get it serviced by an authorized Mercedes Benz dealer and get charged heavily for parts and labour (as well as service personnel and mechanics who always replace unnecessary parts to prevent failure and boost profits). Another option, which is the choice I use is to use a Mercedes-Benz specialist. Real Mercedes enthusiasts usually run these establishments and would only be too happy to give you friendly advice, information if you want it, professional service, guarantees and a competitive price (as they have to compete with the dealerships). You can get your service records stamped which will help at resale time (which probably won&#146t be an issue because you will love your W124 so much :D). Often you will find yourself saving hundreds of dollars using this method. Lastly you could service the car yourself. The W124 is a car that can be easily worked on. Yes the car has some computers in it but they don&#146t dominate the car and much of the engine is still mechanical in its operation. I perform my own maintenance and oil changes. Parts for Mercedes aren&#146t always cheap &#150 sometimes they can be damn expensive, other times you will be surprised at how cheap something was. Often you could use quality aftermarket replacements but some things are Mercedes fit only. The W124 doesn&#146t use excessive amounts of petrol &#150 usually between 9 and 14 litres depending on how it is driven with the diesel being even more economical.

<b>Final Evaluation</b>
You probably would have come across my preaching for this model somewhere across the site. I am always using them as my benchmark for quality and that shows what I think of them. These cars stand up extremely well to the aging process and even a specimen that has covered 250,000 km can drive almost like new. Not only that but the driving experience itself is very close to that provided by a current six-cylinder Mercedes-Benz, which is to say exemplary. The quality of the W124 is not the only positive of the car. Performance is adequate &#150 it is the way it is delivered which is the real strength. The car is a smooth cruiser but if pushed can become quite spritely. It is this flexibility, which makes the W124 appeal to all sorts of drivers.

The flexibility of the W124 with its combined strengths make it one of the best-used car purchases you could make. A truly impressive automobile, which will please you every time, you drive.
