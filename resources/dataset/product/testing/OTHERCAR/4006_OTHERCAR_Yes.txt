            I purchased my 2001 Saturn LS 4cyl. 5spd in November of 2000. I wouldn't consider purchasing a foreign plated vehicle, however, I wanted the build quality of a Japanese make with the solid feel of a German road car. I think the Saturn lives up to both of these. The 4 cyl., an original Lotus designed DOHC 2.2L 16 valve with heavy GM influence, likes to rev all the way up to the 6k mark. The engine is quite smooth and the transmission complements the power by providing sure positive feel shifts in all gears. The 5 speed transmission is the same one used in GM's Saab 9 3 series, which works quite well with the engine. The engine provides more than enough power to move the sedan down the road, while still retaining an impressive and consistent 27 mpg in a city/highway mix.

The build quality is impressive. The interior components based off of the current S-series and GM's Opel Vectra in Germany, are very solid and provide a long lasting feel. The instrumentation is clean and easy to read. 

The ride is a perfect compromise between ride and handling. It is firm, yet will soak up bumps without injuring your behind. The handling is good when pushed hard, however, the tires are not suited for spirited driving. I replaced mine with a set a Michelins, which seem to compliment the suspension much better.  

I only problems I have had with the car was a small squeak in the instrument panel which I fixed myself and the tire concern mentioned above. The replacement tires ride a little harder than the original smooth riding Firestones, however, they were worth the switch. 

Overall the vehicle has been very reliable and fun to drive. Lets give a round of applause for another quality product from Saturn.
