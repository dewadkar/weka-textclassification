            �AM General's 1991 decision to sell to the public finally allowed nonmilitary personnel to experience the exceptional off-road performance and problem-solving abilities of a military-based utility vehicle. Save for a few comfortable and practical refinements, the Hummer is virtually unchanged from its much-storied military counterpart. All of the power, durability and versatility of the military Humvee is available to you in the Hummer, the world's ultimate off-road vehicle.�
--or at least that is what the sales people will say�
The hummer is really an oversized, unpractical, hard to drive, behemoth of a vehicle with bad gas mileage. Don�t get me wrong, it is still a kick-butt off road machine; too bad the only people who actually can afford to own one never take it off pavement. They drive around toting their soccer children and ballerina girls to practice. Here are some reasons you might want to entertain if you plan on buying one.

#1 The size. Yes, you can ford 30� of water and drive through a three-foot snowdrift. The Hummer features a bonded and riveted aluminum alloy body built more like an aircraft than a truck. A steel box frame bolstered by five heavy-duty cross members, 72-degree approach and 37.5-degree departure angles, 72&quot; track width for extreme stability; yes it is 6 feet wide.  Unsurpassed 16&quot; of ground clearance, Multiple heavy-duty cooling systems, 6.5 L, 195-horsepower turbo diesel engine, 37.5x16.5 Goodyear MT radial tires, Runflat tire system, Beadlock tire system, 4000-lb. payload capacity, 42-gallon fuel capacity and if that�s not enough it comes with Helicopter lift hooks so you can pick it up off your favorite island.

#2 The Drive. Well, the new one is quieter than that old one; in fact it�s very quiet, much like a sedan. On road handling is sluggish, with a fair amount of body roll. Cornering isn�t good because it just too heavy. The new V-8 turbo diesel adds to the acceleration, but it is still slow, but it was never made for � mile drag races.  Off road this thing conquers anything. It can practically climb trees. The Hummer has the best stock ground clearance of any vehicle on the road, as well as a run flat system that enables one to keep driving even when a tire goes flat. Another interesting feature is the �stop and rock.� When you stop at a light the truck rocks forward and back because its so heavy. I heard they are terrible in snow too.

#3 The new look. The new redesign gives the Hummer 2 a much more rounded look. New front grill, paneling and chrome accents also make it look more like a street car.

#4  The gadgets. You can deflate and inflate the tires from a button in the cab, lock all the differentials so all four wheels move at the same speed all the time. Helicopter hooks so you can pick it up with your helicopter.  A special snorkel kit can allow one to ford 60 inches of water, yes drive through 5 feet of water. Ohh, and special rocker panels that are side effects of the military version that will protect you from any mines you drive over on your way to gets some eggs and milk.

#5 The price. The Hummer 2 hasn�t been put into production yet but when it does it will probably be between 65 and 90 thousand, depending on the gadgets. So even if you want one, unless you have a good job or a rich family it might be hard getting your hands on one of these.

#6  The Inside. Big is an understatement. The driver and reach out their right arm and barely reach the passenger. Did I mention this thing is wide? The interior of the civilian version is nothing like the military version, all the amenities of a streetcar. The seats are fairly cramped, especially if you�re a big person. I am 5�10� and 180 and I would prefer a larger car. The back seats are roomier but still a bit cramped.  

#7 Being part of the clique that drives them. This I could do without. I have never seen a Hummer driven by anyone that actually looks like they use it for what it was intended, a side effect of being so expensive. I guess I have never seen a Range Rover or Land Rover driven by anyone who looks like they use it for what they were built for either. It�s their right, but they look like a bunch of posers if you ask me.
