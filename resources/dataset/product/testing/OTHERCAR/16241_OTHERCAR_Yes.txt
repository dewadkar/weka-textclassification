            As the second most popular car in the world, I would say that the Toyota Corolla lives up to its title.  The Corolla is a very good value for first time buyers that want a reliable,fun, and peppy car. 

Ride: The ride is very smooth, considering that it is a sub compact...It takes tight curves and bumps with ease.

Engine:The engine is an all aluminium I-4, standard fare on a small car, but this engine delivers excellent acceleration, with minimum noise and effort.

Interior:I have the base model corolla, which is called the VE and comes with the least amount of features, but I must say for a base model with no power locks or windows I feel that the interior is well put together and comfortable, even for long commutes and trips.  I might add that although this is a small car, it is not as cramped as some may think. There are also many nice touches that toyota has included such as a rear cupholder, a nice center storage bin,and seatbelt adjusters. Very comfortable and cozy all together.

Exterior: Redesigned for 1999 and 2000 with a more attractive look than other models.  I especially like the rear light cluster, very modern looking.
