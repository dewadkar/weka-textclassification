            I got my Mercury Sable 5 months ago when I was due with my 3rd baby. I was driving a 1995 Ford 4x4 extended cab truck which I loved but the car seat I had would not sit on the back seat right. The car seat base hung over the back seat at least 3 inches which is not safe so we had no choice but to buy a car. We are a family of 6 so trying to find a vehicle that can fit 6 people comfortably is hard to do. Especially one in a reasonable price range. 

We looked and looked and finally one week before my due date we bought our light blue 4 door 1998 Mercury Sable. The car had very low miles so it was still under factory warranty. The Sable is a comfortable riding car with lots of leg room. It's still hard to ride comfortably when all 6 of us go away but we do it. (I did not want a van) The Sable is a very smooth riding car. The first day I drove it I was going about 65 and did not even realize it. The trunk is huge, I can fit the stroller and all my packages when I go shopping with no problem. I love the 4 doors with the kids.

My Sable came with Air, cruise, tilt, cassette stereo, lumbar seats, heated mirrors, dual air bags and power windows. One word of caution on power windows. Mine only go part way down in the back and my youngest son was messing around and hit the button and the window went up on his head. Luckly I noticed it and ran to the car and put the window back down. We now lock the windows so he can't do that again. he back seat is nice because if needed it folds down so you can put something big in the trunk. My kids thought they could play and crawl back to the truck but that was put to a stop very fast. 

Overall I am very happy with my Sable I have not had any problems yet and hope not to. I get great gas mileage and have comfort yet it's stylish.
