                 My last vehicle hit the 180,000 mile mark and I was concerned about its reliability.  I looked on Epinions.com to see what kinds of vehicles out there I could afford.  The Kia Rio appealed to me, and the worst features mentioned were 1.  lack of HP and 2.  poor quality sound.  

     I went to a tent sale and bought one.  I got a 5 speed with air, cassette radio - a fairly basic package.  The Rio handles very well.  Although the car only has 96 horses, those horses are peppy little critters.  Going up steep mountains puts those horses to the test, but they reliably plod along.

     I found the sound system to be adequate.  The interior is exactly what I needed as a divorced mother with 2 children - the lack of lots of leg room in the back isn't an issue quite yet.  I'm especially pleased that my car has the child safety lock feature in the back doors.  

     Perhaps my biggest beef with the car is the paint.  It's scratched way too easily.  My car already needs repainted, due to two idiot dogs chasing "treeing" a cat on my car.  I doubt if the paint on most vehicles could have withstood that torture, but the Rio could use a higher quality paint or clear coat.
