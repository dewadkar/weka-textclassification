            Reasons why I bought this vehicle:

- Price/quality issue
- Looks
- Style

This vehicle should be bought by people up to 35 years old. It's not a family car, even though it's more spacious inside than it seems when looking from outside. Arm supports missing - a little bit more attention should be paid to these little details that count a lot during a long drive. Lots of space in the rear compartment when the back seats are folded towards the front. Spacing the cup-holders could be done better: I can use three in the front and only one in the rear seats. After market products for RAV4 are kind of expensive and difficult to find. It would have been great if I'd had a choice of engine when I bought this car (I've heard they'll have more options for the 2001 model)
 
Overall: This SUV is fun to drive and economical.<br><br>
