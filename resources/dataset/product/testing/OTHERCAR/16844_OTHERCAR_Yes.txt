            I bought this car new in 1996 because my husband and I were trying to have kids and we needed a car.  We thought we should buy a larger car, so that by the time we had kids we would have it (we didn't think we could afford it after kids). 

 We looked at a lot of station wagons and mini vans.  We liked the Lumina because it was a good car and it came with a very well priced package deal.  We also liked the Dodge Caravan (it drove really well when we tested it) but for the price, we got all the extras in the package that Dodge would have made us pay extra for.  We got luggage rack, shopping netting, locked lug nuts, fancy hubcaps, etc. 

 Well it is now year 2000.  We still don't have kids.  But we LOVE our car!  In the last 6 years we have not had one problem with it (except for a flat tire once--my fault)!!  There is over 75 thousand miles on it,I am NOT kidding about that!  We drove from California to Texas to Florida all the way up to Connecticut.  We drove from Connecticut to Canada, Maine, all the way to Florida, back to Texas and back to California! We drive A LOT!!  Its cheaper than flying and we can sleep in the back if we want to.  And we have slept in the seats before.

I have moved my whole house twice with that van (it has removable seats). And I can impress little kids with the automatic sliding door (we paid extra for that and its worth it when you are carrying a lot of stuff in your arms).  All in all it is a great car.  We decided that when we buy a new car next year we are NOT going to trade in the van.  We love it too much! 

 Last note, when taking out seats...it is NOT hard to do and putting them back is easy cause every seat has a diagram on the back of where to put it.  Each seat comes out separate (not a bench seat) and is not too heavy to move about.<br><br>
