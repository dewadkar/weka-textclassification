            I bought my Stratus ES fully loaded new in Sept. 98, I was buying a leftover new car.  I got stuck with a lemon.  I have a court case going and I am utterly disgraced with this vehicle.  Before 20,000 miles I have had the tires replaced, (michelins) three alignments, tires rotated 3 times, and wheels balanced 3 times.  Then at 23,000 miles the brake pad came loose, and I got it fixed under warranty, now at 28 k miles the bolts backed out of the caliber on the same wheel, so I was out of a car for a day.  Which was in direct result of the repair done at 23,000 miles.  I now cannot turn on my fog lights, and I am greatly disappointed in Chryslers 5 Star service, what a crock of bologne.  There service is horrible, as soon as my breech of warranty suit is over, I am going to trade it in for a GM vehicle.  I understand that Stratus' are nice cars but I got stuck with the rotten apple out of a bunch and now Chrysler is turning the other cheek.  THey claim that they never felt the shaking while going over 45 mph.  Go for another 4 door sedan than this one if you can.
