            I recently leased a 2000 Lexus GS 300 and I'm pretty happy with the decision.  The car has all of the Lexus qualities down pat, and therefore is a very competent car.

The overall driving experience is good.  The braking, acceleration and ride are top notch.  For a 6-cylinder engine, the car has a lot of pep, but somewhat poor gas mileage.  I'm lucky if I get around 17-19 mpg, on premium fuel, of course.  Handling is not all that I had hoped for, but I am very used to driving BMW's, which are known for their excellent handling.  It handles competently, but not sportily.  You can feel it bob up and down during some cornering maneuvers.  But, the ride is very good, so that is a compromise you make.

The interior is immaculately and meticulously designed.  Everything is well placed, with big buttons and easy to use controls for the ventilation and audio system.  Every button and control also operates smoothly, like warm butter.  You get a feeling of quality when you are in this car.  The interior is also very plush, especially the seats.  The quality of leather is much better than that of it's German competitors.  Being a Lexus, it is also very quiet.  I can barely hear the engine running at idle.  The only noise that is a little excessive is wind noise when at highway speeds.  But, you can easily drown out any noise with the excellent stereo.  Crisp sound reproduction no matter how loud you have it.  And I love the fact that the CD changer is up front, where it should be.  Interior space is a little cramped, but everything is comfortable.

The car is missing a few features that are in other cars in this price range.  First off, some features like rain sensing wipers are not present.  Also, Xenon (HID) lights are not available with the GS300 premium package, and have to be installed aftermarket.

Overall, the car is very competent, and costs less than much of the competition, such as the E320 and 528.  If you like a car that is very comfortable and plush, with a very good ride, this is the car for you.  If you prefer a sportier feel, this car will certainly handle well, but won't match the rock solid sportiness of the competition.<br><br>
