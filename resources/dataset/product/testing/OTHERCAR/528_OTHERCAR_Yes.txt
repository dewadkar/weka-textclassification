            At $500 and dropping there's no better deal. This camera in spite of what's been previously written is outstanding.
  For pros it might be insufficient for more than 8x10 prints but for expert/intermediate amateurs & novice picture takers there really isn't a better choice. Picture quality is damn good in almost any environment. For the availability of full auto & full manual control plus everything in between allows excellent creative control that one can choose to grow into if so desired. The IS Zoom gets the shots others just wish they could get and the IS works hand-held throughout the whole optical & digital zoom range with the exception of longer shutter speeds & extreme low-light conditions. The digital zoom is quite good in 
" well lit " situations & almost unrecognizable. I've yet to see a better digital zoom output. The IR illuminator will surprise, if not amaze you with better than you saw with your own eyes results much of the time. 49mm lens thread for filters etc. doesn't hurt either 
  My two year previous experience with a Ricoh RDC 4200 1.3mp digicam really allows me to appreciate The UZIs speed, control, power consumption, Zoom, & picture quality. The UZI is more than 10 times the Ricoh when you add up the quality & all the features available. 
  The only real draw backs to this UZI is the ridiculous pricing of Olympus brand accessories (fl-40 external flash, cable & bracket. Combined cost almost as much as the camera.) Although non-Oly flashes can be used but they won't integrate with the on-board flash as will the FL-40. And the loss of the panoramic function of the Oly SM cards if they're formatted in anything other than the camera.
 
"So don't format the Oly cards in anything but the camera"!

  The small 8mb SM card included in the box is pitifully small at the SHQ setting & pretty much useless in the TIFF setting.
  The 1600MAH NiMh Batteries & 3 hour charger & remote control are good to have. The charger charges my old 1450 MAH NiMh batteries just fine too. I have more than 300mbs of SM cards & this camera is a joy for filling them up. I suggest at least one extra set of batteries & at least one extra SM card of 64mbs or more. 
  I agonized for months while researching which camera to upgrade to. I used my own SM cards to test the E-10, C700 in stores & compared the Canon Pro90IS as well as other 3mp cams online & I'm extremely happy with my UZI. The IS zoom pretty much narrowed the field to the UZI & the Pro90IS with the UZI winning because I could use the batteries and SM cards I already had from my Ricoh. 
  I ruled out the Oly E100RS since it's only 1.3mp & twice the price even though it's quite a bit faster in sequential mode. The sequential shooting speed of the UZI Isn' all that slow & surprisingly sufficient enough for me. 
  The C700 zoom which is not stabilized made hand-held shots with my unsteady hands unsatisfactory through at least half of the optical zoom range & impossible in the digital zoom range. 
  The E-10 had better picture quality with it's +4mp rez but only a 4x zoom and quite a higher price tag. 
  The Pro90IS had a slightly larger ccd, tilt/swivel Lcd & hot-shoe but I don't think the extra $300 -$500 cost as well as the media and proprietary battery situation would be worth it. My Ricoh has the tilt/swivel but I don't miss it much. 
  And finally the Nikon, Canon & other 3mp cams just weren't that much better with their 3x zooms to sway my decision. 
  I take the UZI with me everywhere just in case that Pulitzer moment presents itself & just because it's fun and fast enough to be on & ready to shoot from the time I grab it from the case and put it to my face. With a little practice I've been able to perfect powering it up with my initial contact when grabbing it & not resetting it when it's in an oversize bag on it's side. 
  If pocket ability & large posters are main requirements then this isn't the choice but if you want good unedited print quality to 8x10, reasonably fast performance/power-up & refresh rate, multiple auto, manual & metering controls as well as one of the better on-board flashes & most importantly hand-hold ability from 38 through 1025mm zoom at $500 or less. There really isn't any other choice. 
  I doubt I'd opt for the Pro90IS even at the same price.
  Mine even came with a bad pixel on the rear lcd & the 128 Oly SM card locks the camera up in review mode but both I am told by Oly support are covered for a year under their warranty. Non-Oly cards perform without a problem & there's even a hack out there to enable the pano feature. 
  The UZI will get a chromatic abberation (purple edging) in extremely brightly back-lit conditions but I've not had too many such pics in 4 months so it's not an issue for me.
  Unfortunately the OLY rebate on accessories expires at midnight tonight & it was a nice bonus to get $100 back on the purchase of the Oly 128mb SM card that I'd have eventually bought anyway. 
  Oly Tech support is decent so far & they keep tract of any problems you may report to them. They have given me reference numbers for the few so far minor problems I'm having. I eventually will be sending the UZI & 128 SM card in before next June.
  
         "I recommend the C2100UZ 'very highly'".
