              This is a great car, and well with the time spent at the dealer, took a week, i really got a great deal.  I traded in a 1996 Beretta, they offered me 5300.00 other car dealers offered me from 1800.00 to 3000.00, Kia was the way to go for me.  
  They had a 2000 Kia Sephia, with the works, absolutely everything, plus i had a payoff of 6900 for my car. they ended up paying off my car, plus giving me a discount on the new Sephia, 14,369 was the total price. and the new price on the car was 15,589.00.  
  Trust me it has everything! i drove it home and haven't seen any problems with it yet, it has 53 miles on it and runs great, i would recommend Kia to anyone, especially with the 10 year 100,000 mile warranty, they have confidence to back it with all that, it has to be a good car or they would be out of business.   
  The driving of this car, its okay, its not luxury, but its not a old escort,(my older car), but for the price i think its the best around. If your looking for a good buy and a great looking car this is the way to go.<br><br>
