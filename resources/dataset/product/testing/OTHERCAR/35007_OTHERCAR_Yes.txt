            I bought my little Mirage S new and it has been a dream to own ever since.  Nothing has ever gone wrong in eight years and the only repairs have been normal maintenance like replacing the timing belt and hoses, etc.  It's now got almost 130K miles and it still runs like a top.  It has great visibility and maneuverability, terrific gas mileage, and peppy acceleration for such a little engine.

The first three years I owned it in New England, where ice was scraped off the windshield every winter morning; and then I moved to the desert where it gets baked in 110 degree heat.  Amazing, but the exterior paint is still bright.

Some interior plastics have started to get a little brittle, however, and the seat covers fell apart at the seams. The seats are still very comfortable, though. This was no-frills car, but it has served me well.

On the other hand, I'll never buy from a Mitsubishi dealership again. The one in Danbury CT that I bought from in 1995 was a bunch of liars who screwed me with add-on "insurance."  They went out of business shortly after.
