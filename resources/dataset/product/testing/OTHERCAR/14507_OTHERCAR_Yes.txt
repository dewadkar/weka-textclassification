            All of my friends look at me in shock when I jump into my truck telling them it is unlocked.  How are we supposed to get in the back.  Well Nissan has answered this problem with the Frontier Crewcab.  It looks mostly nice and has great ride.
Well I of course love the four doors on this truck.  They tend to make many situations so much easier to manage for lazy me.  The body does has that funny look to it.  I have had mine reffered to as the baby truck.  In spite of this there are so many options to line the inside with goodies, you will feel like you are in a lexus.
I chose to go with the leather interior and manual transmission.  I am using it for off roading, as I have a 4X4 model, so the leather is easy to clean and the gear control is always nice.  You can enjoy all the benefit of a six disk cd player that is in dash.  No need to control it from there when the steering wheel has controls added to its fortay of buttons.  Overlaying the airbag you have you cruise control options.  And the best part is there are plenty of cup holders, and they fit all my cups.
Well this is the car for me because I want comfort and the ability to haul lots of stuff.  There is room to make roadtrips and not have anything to worry about as far as comfort.  This truck may look like... well..something, but it is convienient beyond imagine.
