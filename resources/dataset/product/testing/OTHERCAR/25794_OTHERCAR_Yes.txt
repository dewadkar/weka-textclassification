            I purchased my 626 LX in June of 2000 once I discovered that the vehicle I was driving would have cost over $3000 to repair. (Got to love that keyless start and anti door lock feature) I had never paid more than $2000 for a vehicle, and never had car payments, so I was looking for something used that would make my payments around $250 a month. 
    
I looked at a few vehicles, including a 1998 Chevy Malibu and a 1997 Ford Contour. Both of those seemed to lack a smooth ride and I could hear the noise from the road. The interior was uncomfortable, and they just didn't seem like the right car for me. 
    
I then stumbled upon my baby on the lot for a remarkable price. When I test drove it I found that the ride was smooth, the interior was comfortable and it was just as much as the other vehicles I had test drove, but it had more options and features, including air, CD and cruise control. Needless to say, I took that one.
    
I have owned the car for almost a year now, and am still very pleased. It has good pick up for a 4 cylinder, the engine is quiet and it rides smooth without much road noise.(My mother drives a 1997 Pontiac and the engine is 10x louder than mine.) I get about 27 miles to the gallon, and the 4 doors are wonderful when I have a car full of friends, and the fold down rear seats are a real life saver when I throw my bike in the trunk. 

Even my boyfriend who is so critical about everything enjoy's driving my car. He says it is quite powerful and it moves well for a 4 cylinder. 
    
The only negative thing about this vehicle is the cost to repair. The ignition coil went this winter, and it cost me over $200 to repair at the dealership. Had I gone elsewhere, it may have been cheaper, as the labor rate was ridiculous. I change it's oil every 3500k, and I do all the services. I am good to my car and it is very good to me. =)
