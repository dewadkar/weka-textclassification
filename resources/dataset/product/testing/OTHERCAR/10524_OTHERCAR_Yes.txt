            The Acura TL is like buying a front wheel drive BMW 328i except it is
$10,000 less expensive and faster than a 328 automatic.

Its fit and finish is perfect, the infinitely adjustable power drivers seat can go very far back for my fried who is 6'4&quot;, but very close up and high for my wife who is very short.  The seats are very nice to touch leather, and come with seat heaters that really work.  The climate control
even on zero degree days comes on very quickly but does not broil you like Toyota products tend to do.  The outside temperature and the inside temperature are different displays, as are the real odometer and the trip odometers.  There are other nice touched like a center console with 3 compartments, cup holders that can hold different size cups and cans.  The center console also can be adjusted to where you want it under your arm.  It also has radio/cd controls on the steering wheel and an electronic automatic darkening read view mirror, plus heated side mirrors.

Now for driving information.  It has a 5 speed automatic transmission that can be self shifted both up and down easily.  It also comes with Michelin MXV tires, 4 wheel disk ABS brakes with traction control.  Quoting Car and Driver it does 0-60 in 7.1 seconds, but you can feel the car instantly respond to the gas pedal.  The brakes seem to match the accelleration, and the turning is instantaneous.  It feels like a BMW except a little faster than 328 automatics.  It also has as many safety features including the new 2 stage airbags, side airbags, door beams, and sensors to detect children in front seats.  It even senses if you are slouching in a way that would cause you injury with the side airbags.

Now for what BMWs don't do.  It goes in the snow.  Starting from a standstill on an upgrade on an icy surface it just goes.  Start off with all four wheel on slippery snow and it goes.  This is due to the tires since they are all season and the suspension can deal with loss of traction when the traction control system does its job very well.  

I bought this car because my wife likes to drive fast (she has a 25 mile mainly highway commute) but she has to get to work when it snows.  Her Toyota Camry Solara got stuck 1/2 block from our house when even Mustangs could go and with brand new tires.

The people who should buy this car are people who like to drive, but be comfortable and safe.  They want more than basic transportation but some fun.
