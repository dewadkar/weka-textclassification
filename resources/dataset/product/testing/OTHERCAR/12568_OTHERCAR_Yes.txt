            I own a 1996 Acura Integra RS coupe that I've had for three years now. The car is reasonably fast (thanks to the manual transmission), great for storage and carrying things, and reasonably comfortable. A weak A/C and the occasional rattle and shake mar the overall experience.

Pros:

- Compact for driving and parking.
- Very roomy with the hatchback. I've fit in pieces of furniture and boxes by folding down the seats that wouldn't have fit in much larger cars.
- Fun to drive - good cornering and decent acceleration.
- Good quality internal components. Doesn't feel cheap and plasticky like many other cars in the same price range.

Cons:

- Noisy - the engine revs very high, and road noise isn't too well insulated.
- Very weak A/C. Turning it on has a significant effect on the car's performance, and it does a poor job of keeping the insides cool.
- Slightly underpowered for sporty driving.
- Rattles and shakes on the rearview mirror and the doors. Not significant, but sometimes bothersome.
- Stock tires have weak grip and are prone to skid on tight turns.
- Limited range - gas tank only holds about 11 gallons.

My biggest regret is that I wish I'd bought the GS-R. Although the integra is zippy with the manual transmission, every now and then one wishes that the engine didn't have to strain so much when trying to accelerate.<br>
