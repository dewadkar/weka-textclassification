            I am 16 years old and have had my license for nine months. During the winter I drove my grandparents pontiac sunfire. They came home from arizona and I gave it back to them. Not having a car sucked. My best friend bought a 1990 honda accord for a really good price. I look online for a while a found many cars I liked. For some reason the Honda Accord stuck out in my mind. I made a proposal to my grandpa that if he would help me out with buying a used car I would pay him back. When he had listened to what I had to say he offered to pay for the thing himself. I found a 1990 Honda accord online for $2400. It had 180,000+ miles but sounded in good condition. We went to this guys house and I test drove the car. I didn't love it right away but liked it enough that we decided to buy it. I have had the car for a little over 2 months now and I love driving it. I can't wait to go places because I know i'll get to take my car. There are a few things wrong with it but no major problems. It is comfortable and drives great for a 10 year old car with so many miles. At the age of 16 I've been sold on Honda's for life. My friend and I both have 1990 Honda Accord LXs. We love them and work on them together and I would recommend this car to anyone. The steering is great it is relativly quiet and get me where I need to go. Over all...Honda makes great vehicles.<br><br>
