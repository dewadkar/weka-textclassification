            Well a few months ago me and my fiance at the time were looking to get rid of my 96 Ford Thunderbird that I was having a lot of transmission problems with.  I looked around for a while and researched many hours on the internet trying to find the perfect car.  I was looking for something that was sporty.  Not only looking, but performance wise.  But yet it had to be practical enough to carry a family around.  And when I saw the Pontiac Grand Am GT1.  I fell in love.  I took my fiance' to see it and she was absolutely in love as well.  To tell you the truth the only reason we even test drove the car at the dealer was to ensure that it had the power behind its powerful look.  And let me tell you it did.  I put the pedal to the floor the first time.  I fell like I was being launched out of the catapult of U.S. Navy's finest nuclear aircraft carrier.  I was so very impressed.  I didn't think twice about it.  I took the car back to the dealer walked right into the show room and bought it.  

It is like pure Heaven driving this car.  It has all the comforts of a large car.  Plenty of leg room front and back.  Sunroof, AM/FM Stereo, CD and Cassette player.  And the sound system is incredible.  I have a lot of my friends ask me what kind of system I am running in my car.  And when I tell them I am running a stock system the generally look at me twice like I am losing my mind.  

To top off this car it is the most beautiful and awesome car that I have ever owned.  By far.  If you are looking for a sporty, fast, family car for not all the much money... Then you are lookin at the right car.  THE 2000 PONTIAC GRAND AM GT1.<br><br>
