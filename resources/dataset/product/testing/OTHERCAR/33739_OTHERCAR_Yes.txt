            95 Nissan Maxima SE, automatic, very good car overall.  No extraordinary features, but overall a good all-around car for normal people.  The car was bought new, replacing the 91 Maxima SE.  The engine has a 30hp increase over the 91 Model, so there was a big difference in power.  Power delivery was smooth and had decent punch as almost all speeds.  It lacked the punch of my Mom's Mazda Millenia, but also gives up 20hp.  The automatic transmission works pretty well, shifting when its supposed to, and does it smoothly.  Passing power is sufficient, but not great.  Low end power is very good, better than the Millenia.

The car handles decent, but not great.  It tended to have a little less grip than the 91 Maxima, though turn-in and overall handling was better.  Wet weather handling was decent, snow was a little dissappointing.  The brakes are decent as well, though not as good as the Millenias.  It was significantly better than the 91 Maxima.

The interior design is very tasteful and well done.  All gauges are black on white, and are easy to see.  All the vents and stereo controls are within reach.  Overall fabric and plastic quality is very good.  I bought the cloth seat version because I don't really like leather, and its fairly comfortable, except it feels a little flat, perhaps typical of sedans.  I wish it contoured the body a little more.  Rear seat room and overall headroom is at least adequate.  Trunk space is pretty generous, but those "bars" that hold the trunk lid up give up the height of the trunk.  I wish they used hydrolics instead.  The "premium" bose stereo with cassette/cd combo is decent.  The unit itself was good, but the speakers weren't the best.  Midrange and midbass response was actually very good, but the highs sounded very harsh, and the very low frequencies were absent.  I'm a stereo freak, so I put in an aftermarket unit.

The tires are 65 series 15", the next years model used 16" wheels on the SE models, which I would have preferred for better handling.  The overall paint quality is ok, but the paint itself is kind of plain, and it gets dull-looking if not washed frequently, but that's partly due to the fact that my car is black.  The car is mostly free of squeaks, but the doors feel very flimsy.  It feels really light and when you close it, it doesn't have that solid feel or sound to it.  Nothing too big, but it just feels a little cheap.

I've had this car for 5 years, with almost 100k miles on it, and so far, the problems have been minimal.  The two most serious problems have been a dead alternator (2) years ago, and a dead starter this past winter.  All other problems have been very minor - burned out foglight and headlight (normal), occasionally squeaky brakes (heard this was fairly common among Nissans and some other cars), rear door mechanism need greasing and a few other general maintenance stuff.
