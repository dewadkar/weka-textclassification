             I've listed a lot of reservations below; I don't dislike the car at all.  But it's certainly a hyped-up product.  It remains to be seen whether it delivers on all the promises!

 First of all, my dealer has stopped taking 2004 orders!  So you may not be able to get one at all.  I wanted an intermediate options package, with side-curtain air bags and Stability Control,  but without a DVD Navigation system.  I was told that they "seem" to be building 2004 Priuses only "stripped" ($21,000) and "loaded" ($26,500).  Money wasn't my primary issue, but I would have hated myself every time I saw the Navigation system, so I took it stripped.  I give my dealer a lot of credit for honoring my August, 2003 order in December, 2003 (The tax deduction decreases by $250 in January, 2004), and not giving the car to some doctor who buys a new Land Cruiser every year.

 The car is indeed as spacious and comfortable as a Camry.  It rides a little harder (see below), but certainly accelerates as well as a 4-cylinder Camry, meeting Toyota's promise.  Like most hatchbacks, the rear visibility is poor, especially with adults in the back seat.  The seating position is nice and high for a sedan, but you still can't see the front of the hood.  Rear leg room is outstanding for a Japanese mid-size.  All of the dimensions (but not the sheet metal shape or the unibody) are similar to those of a Camry.

 It's not fair to evaluate mileage on a car with only 600 miles on the (electronic) odometer.  But I believe this car can get 60 MPG in heavy city traffic in the summer, with the A/C off.  It won't at any other time.  Although the A/C is electric for 2004, running the heater (which is a top-notch heater, with climate control features) encourages the engine to run, especially when the car is cold.  My computer is currenly reporting 44.5 MPG average, for a 15-mile highway + 10-mile city commute.

 You must understand that the high mileage is part of a big picture: Aerodynamics (odd profile, no roof rack), low front end sheet-metal, 5W-30 motor oil, high tire pressure, extra-cost low-rolling resistance tires, and sensible driving practices.  It won't happen "automatically"!

 Moving the speedometer readout towards the driver was a big improvement in this year's model.  If you don't have "keyless start", you have to insert the entire remote-door fob into the dashboard to start the car.  This means you have to spend several hundred dollars to get a third key, when they become available.  Be sure to leave the "Valet" instructions in the car if you have to park and leave the key.

 At 600 miles, I like the car, and am satisfied with Toyota's promises.  It remains to be seen if they hold up over time.
