            As we own a Van used for long distance driving we wanted something smaller to drive around the City and for short trips. My wife was also going to drive so she also preferred a smaller vehicle. With the Van we enjoy sitting up high so so this is one thing we were looking for as well we thought 4 wheel drive would be great in the winter. This is how we decided on the Tracker. Our only requirement was automatic transmission.
The vehicle is great in the city. Great viewing when driving and easy to manoeuvre because of it's size. It is not the most comfortable car or SUV in the world but sufficient for short trips. When on the highway it is not the easiest handling vehicle, it does not hold the road as our van or other large vehicles. I certainly would not want to take a long trip in it. However being an elderly couple we are more fussy when it comes to comfort. It is certainly cheaper on gas than larger SUV's and as far as repairs, we have had none to date. However our mileage is still low. I feel younger people who want a SUV without great power and less comfort but a lower price and operational cost should look closely at this vehicle   <br><br>
