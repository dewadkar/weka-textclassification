            I've owned a '99 Boxster with all factory performance driving options (traction control, 17&quot; wheels, stiffer suspension) since 8/98.  It has been an amazing ride.  Excellent handling, bar none.  Usual Porsche &quot;surprise oversteer&quot; at the limits, but the traction control helps on the road and can be turned off for the track.  I'm also tall (6') and of the Z3, M3, and SLK the Boxster provided the most comfort while still providing a snug seat to hold you in place around corners.

Torque at low revs (sub 2000RPM) can drag, but this is being addressed by the wider power curve and small (17HP) power bump of the MY2000 Boxster and the 250HP plant in the MY2000 Boxster S.

Complaints include: plastic rear window (easy scratched and does not have a defroster), limited compartment storage space (though there is plenty of room in the two trunks for enough luggage and supplies for a long weekend), a very expensive stereo upgrade that does not provide good sound nor match the excellent fit and finish of the rest of the car, and the high price and lack of dealer willingness to price bargain.<br>
