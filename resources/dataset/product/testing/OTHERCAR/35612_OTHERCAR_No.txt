            I felt that a review of my three-year-old 1998 Chevrolet Malibu would be more relevant at this time.  Most people are in love with their new cars and fail to be objective when writing reviews shortly after the purchase.

Currently our 1998 Malibu LS has 85,000km on it and a few serious flaws have arisen.  The most annoying problem that we have had is a reoccurring brake problem, more specifically, the front brake rotors warp prematurely.  The calipers and pads are well within service limits while the brake rotors warp.  This warping causes a serious and potentially dangerous vibration while braking.  The majority of mileage driven on our car was highway miles that would eliminate the most common problem of warping rotors.  I have found that more than 60% of Malibu owners have this problem as well. http://members.home.net/lbjgh/malibu/malibu.htm

Poor fit and finish on the Malibu is apparent inside and out.  The poor exterior panel fit is contributing to a very annoying wind noise problem that GM wasn't able to fix under warranty.

Other problems include, faulty fan speed-control switch (twice), premature corrosion of the wheel centre caps, and poor on-centre feel at highway speeds.

One thing going for the Malibu is the MSRP.  Compared to the Japanese and European imports, the Malibu is a relative steal.  Unfortunately, you get what you pay for... lower price = poorer quality, both from an engineering standpoint and from a quality standpoint.

I would not recommend the Malibu unless price is your only consideration.
