            I live in Ohio and there is a lot of snow.  My other cars are rear wheel drive so I was excited when I found Mercedes was coming out with a SUV.  I bought a 98 ML 320 and was very happy with it and traded it in for a new 2000 ML430.  The new 2000 model is much better than the previous years.  The interior is much more luxurious than the old ones.  Finer materials and leather are used. The engine is a 4.3 liter V8 that produces 268 hp.  This provides a nice pickup for a SUV.  However if you would like real good pickup that compares to a sports car, consider a ML 55.  The car also has tiptronic shifting.  It handles well in the snow but performance could be improved with better snow tires.  The tires that come with the car are meant for on road driving and aren't designed to handle off-road very well.  The storage in the back is much bigger than a Grand Cherokee or a Ford Explorer.  The car comes with many standard features, the only things that are needed is a standard cd player with BOSE and the sunroof. A really cool option is a Skyview sunroof which extends throughout the entire roof.  This car is good for many people. It offers great 4 wheel drive with Mercedes quality.  However if you really want a car like ride, consider a Lexus RX300 or a BMW X5.  These cars don't have good off-road abilities but drive well and handle snow just fine.  Also, if you want to haul lots of kids around, try a minivan or a Ford Expedition.  <br><br>
