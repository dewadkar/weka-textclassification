            The Toyota Camry is quite simply a wonderful car.  From comfort to style to reliability to gas mileage, this car has it all!

I have driven American-made cars for most of my life - mainly Fords.  But I kept reading great reviews of the Toyota Camry.  Consumer Reports kept rated it an exceptional car, with an unbeatable record for Reliability.  Since Toyota now assembles cars in the U.S., I decided I wouldn't be too un-American to at least look at this car.

I talked to people who have owned Toyotas.  They raved.  They talked about the car like it was member of the family.  They told me stories of how their Camry's outlived the family pets.  They talked about the car being passed from generation to generation.

I went to the dealer and looked at the new Toyotas.  Now, I'm an engineer by trade.  I have an eye for details and for flaws.  What I saw in the Toyota Camry was nothing short of perfection.  This car was designed and built with incredible attention to detail.  And when you put this kind of attention into the design, you get a car that will run without problems for many, many years.

All right.  Enough gushing over design.  Is it comfortable?  Yes again.  The seat has a good range of adjustment, and there is plenty of headroom for those of us over 6 feet tall.  The controls are very well laid-out.  The temperature controls heat up the car quickly (very important feature, as I write this in Pennsylvania in February!)

Is it fun?  Yes, this car is good fun to drive.  Even with the 4-cylinder engine, this car has plenty of acceleration.  And I still get between 25 and 30 miles per gallon, depending on how much highway driving I am doing.

I have had the car for over 2 years now, and have had no reliability incidents with my Camry whatsoever.  I did take the car to the dealer after some vandals tried to get in the gas tank, and damaged the inside gas-cap release mechanism.  Even though I had no appointment, the Toyota Service people fixed the cap release, and even ran in to get some matching touch-up paint to cover the barely-perceptible scratches in the paint!  All handled on-the-spot, no appointment, no charge!!

As you can see, I have already adopted the Camry into my family.  I expect that it will be with us for a good long time.  In fact, I'm already planning to pass it along to my kids when the time comes (even though my oldest is only 8!).

If you want a solid, well-made, reliable, and comfortable car, you just can't go wrong with the Toyota Camry!
