            I purchased my new Rodeo because Isuzu has updated the styling and feel of their auto.  This is my first Rodeo and to this date I have been VERY satisfied with the drive, feel and looks of the vehicle.

I am impressed with many features of the vehicle such as it's sharp styling, the &quot;tight&quot; feel to the drive and also the spaciousness of the interior.  The V-6 engine has plenty of horse power in my 2 Wheel Drive model to tackle any driving situation I have thrown at it so far.  My needs do not necessitate the use of 4 Wheel Drive, so I opted for the cheaper 2 Wheel Drive model.

There are only a couple of things I would change about the Rodeo.  1. The seats are not as comfortable as they could be, but this is only a nuisance on long drives.  2. The rear seat belts do not retract well into their slots, which causes them to bind in the doors every so often.  3. The gearing in the transmission is very low and it really wants to jump off the starting line in the lowest gears.  Not so much a problem as much as it is a necessity to shift quickly until you get into third or fourth gear.

Other than those items listed above, I have been very happy with my purchase and would highly recommend the vehicle to anyone.  Hope this has helped in your purchase.
