            This is the fourth Corolla I have owned in the last 12 years, and I love it!!  Technically, I don't really &quot;own&quot; the vehicle, as we lease it, but by leasing, I know that every 3 years I'm going to be getting a new car and its something I look forward to.  This time, I was convinced that I was going to &quot;upgrade&quot; to a Camry, but after shopping around, I found that for the money we were prepared to pay, I would end up with the very base model, but if I stayed with the Corolla, it would be &quot;loaded&quot;.I am now driving around in a Silver LE with spoiler, sun roof, cruise control, tilt wheel, and front and side airbags, just to name a few features.  The ride is extremely smooth with little outside noise.  Gas mileage was also a big factor for me as we do a lot of highway traveling (including round trip from New England to Florida each year).  I know the car isn't &quot;broken in&quot; as yet, but so far I have been averaging 36 mpg on the highway. Not bad, considering the price of gas these days.  About the only thing I  dont like about the vehicle is the comfort of the seats on a long drive.  They are fine for short trips, but anything over an hour and my back starts to hurt.  I have a pillow that I keep in the car for that purpose and that pretty much solves the problem, but it would be nice if they would install the lumbar adjustments in the seats like my husband has in his Chevrolet S10.   I highly recommend the Corolla for all around value and know that this probably wont be the last one I'll call my own!   <br><br>
