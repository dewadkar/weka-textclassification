            THE BEST OUT THERE 
TOYOTA might just be the best car on the road.  Why you ask?  Because our family is full of TOYOTA lovers.  My immediate family owns two, my parents one, and my sister is on her second.  

LOOKS ARE IMPORTANT
To tell you the TRUTH, I bought my '89 COROLLA because I liked the look of it.  I didn't have enough money to get the best so I did what I could.  I bought that had all the things I needed and just one treat.  A moon roof.  I must say that it still looks pretty good.  It doesn't look all box shaped like other cars of it's age.  To this day I still love the little thing.  I do miss it though.

TRUST IS IMPORTANT ALSO
I gave the COROLLA to my son when he turned sixteen almost a year ago.  After ten years it was still running great and had my trust.  I felt comfortable giving it to my son without fearing that it would break down or anything on him.

NEVER SKIPPED A BEAT...ALMOST
Nothing has ever gone wrong with the car...almost.  The only time that I can think of that anything went wrong is when the engine fell apart on me.
Don't worry though.  That was my fault.  Not knowing anything about cars, I didn't bother to pull over when i heard a loud knocking.  I guess one of the pistons or something blew out from not having enough oil.  That's another reason I am so amazed at it's performance.  All those years of having me for an owner and it STILL RUNS!!!

COLD WEATHER HURTS
I do have to admit that sense it has sat in the cold weather for almost a year now, the weather is beginning to show.  It is sometimes hard to start in the morning and the locks are a little harder to open.  That is it though.  Still runs great after it warms up for a couple of minutes.
