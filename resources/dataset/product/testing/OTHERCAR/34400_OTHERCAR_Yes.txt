            I came very close to buying this car. When I was in the market for a new car, I looked closely at three different models: A Honda Civic Hatchback (wrote a review on that), a Ford Focus ZTS (never even test-drove it) and the Hyundai Tiburon.

I went to check out the Tiburon first. Things started out great...the dealer was very responsive to my needs, found the exact car I wanted (5-speed, cd player, and a sunroof) and I was happy to find one with all of the above (slathered in obnoxious orange paint...I *loved* it) plus power windows and locks was only stickered for $14,033...not a bad deal at all! The Focus was only slightly cheaper comparably equipped but a bit less of a car and the Honda (I'm guessing) would have been about $17,000. 

I test drove the car (without the salesman in it...I got lucky) and loved it. The engine was nicely responsive and potent, although it must be whipped up into the high revs to really perform. It pulls up to 100 mph without hesitation, and feels quite stable at that speed. I wasn't able to go any faster, though...my trusty radar detector (which I managed to sneak in) went off due to the Dallas police :p

The disappointment, performance-wise, is the handling. The car sits rather high compared to what I'm used to...and the body leans quite a bit for a car that is trying to be this sporty. It seems to stick to the road decently, however, and pretty much goes where you point it. 

The interior was quite nice. I really like the silver decor touches on the dash, and the drivers seat was quite firm but shaped nicely. The dash has a sort of jet-airplane sort of appeal. 

About 20 minutes into my drive was where things got bad. I started feeling *really* nauseated. I'm still not sure why. I opened the window and that helped a bit. Something in about the smell of the car was really nauseating. I pulled over and got out for a few minutes and felt better; five more minutes of driving I was about to puke again. Scary scary!

So anyway, I drove the car back to the dealer...got in another tiburon...sat for like five minutes, and you guessed it; nausea. So, I took this as a message from my body to NOT buy the car. I suppose it was a good idea that I listened.

Wish I could have bought it! It was a very charming car.<br><br>
