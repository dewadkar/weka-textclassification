            After a lifetime of shooting pictures on film, I bought this camera. My main reasons were its long 10x zoom (27x digital) and the fact that it feels like a real camera. Since then, I have been amazed at what the camera can do. It's easy to simply point and shoot pictures, with or without the built-in flash.

As I've taking pictures with this camera at family gatherings and at work, people have been amazed by the long zoom lens, ease of use and quality of the shots. I've converted several family members and co-workers to digital photography with it.

The C-2100UZ (called the UZi by its fans) has built-in image stabilization, like videocameras, so you can hand-hold it for longer exposures in low light. It offers a whole range of advanced shooting options, like shutter priority, aperture priority, white balance, spot/average metering, etc., for the more sophisticated user.

The camera comes with a set of rechargable AA batteries -- and the charger! -- and a remote control, so you can put yourself in the pictures. Battery life is much better than some other cameras I considered. I can shoot all day on one set of batteries. 

One potential drawback some people have with this camera is its 1.92 megapixel sensor (1600 x 1200), but I have discovered that I can easily print 8x10 photos, even if I've cropped part of the image. Most of the time, I have to scale my pictures down to email them, anyway.

The SmartMedia storage card that comes with the camera is only 8MB, holding about 16 full-size pictures at standard JPEG compression. I've seen 128MB cards for as low as $54 and 64MB cards for $20, with rebates, so reusable memory costs are far less than film. Since you can erase pictures you don't want to keep, you can take more good pictures, anyway.

I looked at several different cameras before buying this one, and I believe it had the best combination of features and price. I haven't been sorry for my decision.
