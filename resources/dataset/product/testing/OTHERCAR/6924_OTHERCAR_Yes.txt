            I had read about the Insight before it came out, and was trying to make up my mind between it and the Prius.  Since most of my driving would be highway, the deciding factor was the Insight achieved 68 mpg highway and the Prius only 45 mpg.

I've now put over 30,000 miles on the car, so this is not a review by someone who took it for a test drive.

2 Seat Limitation: With a wife and 2 kids, the car allocation is pretty easy.  First, install an on/off switch for the passenger side airbag.  Next, the Insight can be used when 1 or fewer passengers are to be transported (which is well over 50% of our trips).  The family car (33 mpg Saturn) is used on other occasions.  We've never had any time when the 2 seat limitation kept anyone from going anywhere.  Those with families of 4 or more children might want to consider the Civic Hybrid or the Prius.

Mileage: When I am thinking about fuel economy and drive with moderation, the Insight rewards me with 70+ mpg.  When I drive normally, I average 60-65 mpg.  When I'm in a hurry, I only get 55-60 mpg.

Handling, Driveability: Similar to my 1972 Triumph, though a bit smoother.  While not an out and out sports car, it does have a sporty, nimble feel. The lightweight aluminum body helps to offset the weight of the batteries.  The shifting and wheel motions are easy and precise, pedals are very accessible, and all other controls are at your fingertips. 

Fit and Finish: Like most Hondas, the engineering and production are excellent, with attention paid to detail and driver nuances.

Reliability: So far, nothing of substance to report.  The emissions control monitor required a tweak when I took it in for it's scheduled maintenance.  Acceleration is adequate, and best in the lowest gears.  The gauges can be a tad distracting for the first 100 miles or so, but the art of driving the Insight soon becomes second nature.
Image: I'm not the type to buy a car to enhance my image, but this drew dozens of interested onlookers a week in the first year. As the antithesis of the SUV image, it does seem to make those drivers squirm when I'm stopped beside them.

If I had the chance to do it all over again, I wouldn't hesitate the purchase the Insight.
