            Bought this car for mom, the 99 Millenia S.  It's been a little over a year now, I've driven it numerous times, and overall, I have to say it drives a lot better than my 95 Nissan Maxima.  Turn-in and overall handling and grip are very good compared to the Maxima, likely due to its 17" 50 series tires.  Surprisingly, the ride is also very good for the lower profile tires.  In fact, it seems better than the Maxima, which uses 60 series, though the worn springs and struts on the older car may be a factor.

The engine is pretty good overall, but works much better at higher speeds.  Highway passing power is more than adequate, and during normal driving, it has plenty of power.  However, I was disappointed with the lag sometimes associated with the supercharger at very low speeds.  For example, when I am stuck in rush hour traffic and hit the accellarator to move to another lane, it has considerable lag, which could be dangerous if it doesn't kick in soon enough and the car in the other lane closes in.  Don't have the problem with the good sized V6 engine in the maxima.  Highway passing and power and medium to higher speeds is much quicker and smoother than the Maxima.

Overall handling is another strong point with this car.  As stated before, it has a good combination of handling and ride quality.  To my suprise, during this past winter, the car drove the absolute best of any car I've ever driven in the snow.  We had a nasty snow one week and my Maxima was sliding all over the place with now grip, though that was partly due to the fairly worn tires.  The Millenia cruised in the especially slippery snow, hardly ever slipping and always in control.  I was quite surprised, given the 50 series 17" tires.  They are Dunlop SP4000 all-season high performance tires.  I had those tires in my old 91 Maxima (65 series) and it didn't handle nearly as well as the Millenia in the snow.  Braking is very good on this car, and the ABS system works well with minimal pulsing of the pedals.

The interior is generally well done, with all the controls located within reach.  Material quality is overall pretty good for a car in this price range, though the doors have cheap looking and fealing plastic.  Leather lining on the door would have looked better, though this isn't a luxury car.  The leather seats are fairly firm but have decent comfort.  I wish it had more support on the sides, though.  I'm not a big fan of leather - too hot in summer, too cold in winter, though they look nice.  The leather quality is decent for this price range, it was much better than my 91 Maxima's leather seats.  The power seats have a decent range of controls, but wish it had memory settings.  The rear seats are decent, and leg room is ok.  Trunk space is very good as well.  The factory Bose stereo really sounds horrible.  There is no bass and the sound just plain stinks, especially for a Bose "premium" system.  One other thing, the when the airconditioner is turned on, the compressor kicks in and makes an ugly noise, which can be kind of annoying.

Reliability has generally been good.  The only thing wrong so far has been one of the fog lights going out.  Other than that, we have experienced no other problems so far.  This car is outdated and is likely to be replaced soon.  The sticker price is high, and there are probably better overall cars in its price range.  However, there are significant discounts offered on it, so you can buy it for much less.  We paid $24,500, with a sticker around $30,000, I think.  You can probably get one for less these days, and I think it represents a pretty good value for the selling price.  Overall, I would recommend this car.
