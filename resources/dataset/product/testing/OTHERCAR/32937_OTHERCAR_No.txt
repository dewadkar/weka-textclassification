            I bought my Grand Caravan Sport 2001 last Nov. 2000, and it has been to the shop for around 5 times already. As soon as I got it, it had strange steering wheel vibrations when running at 60mph, and it took me 4 visits to the shop to have it fixed (Wheel balanced, Aligned, and then replaced all four wheels). I had a test drive before I bought it, but we didn't notice the vibrations after a few weeks...

A few days after I got the van, we found the rubber seal for the Liftgate doors was hanging out... I was able to fix it by putting some glue in and pushing it all the way in...  We noticed how the rubber seals for all the doors were poorly mounted, so we had to do it ourselves... I guess the people building the thing were tired and never exerted more force when pushing the seals in...

My under chassis is starting to rust already (less than 6 months after I bought it!), I asked them why they don't make rustproofing standard or inform me about it before I purchased (so I could've had it rust proofed by Ziebart or something), they say most owners replace they vehicles every 3 years, so if I wanted to keep it for more than that I should rust proof it myself!(This means I have take taxis again while I having it rust proofed!)... My previous car (a 2000 Hyundai Elantra) didn't have rusts at all when I had it traded in for this poorly constructed vehicle! 

Just yesterday my Airbag light lit up while I was driving! This means I have to miss work again to have it fixed....  On the fourth month the usual hum of a running engine started to have slight rattles... I'll have it checked out when I bring it in for the airbag light repair... 

All in all, I'm very disappointed with this vehicle... I was expecting very strict quality similar to Japanese vehicles, or at least not having any problems within the first year of use! But reading up on previous Caravan comments from the Newsgroups, I guess Daimler-Chrysler hasn't done anything about their quality and still prefers quantity...

I bought a brand new vehicle so that I wouldn't be getting problems with having it fixed, but I think I would've been better off buying a used car instead! 

I asked Chrysler for compensation for my transportation to and from the shop and work, but they told me that they don't offer it. I guess I know now why they're having problems with their stock prices! If they keep this "quality" up, all of America will soon be driving Japanese cars!
