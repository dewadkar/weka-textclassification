               I was going to post a review of MY car, a 2000 Dodge Neon, but since I bought it only a week ago, I don't think I'm really qualified to give a fair opinion of it.  

My mother, however, bought a new Pathfinder last year, and I have driven it more than she has, since I take my siblings to school and run all the errands (and, OK, I did a little joyriding too).  I like the way the Pathfinder handles, and its 4-wheel drive comes in handy.  When my parents went on vacation this spring, Mom left me the Pathfinder, and everyone at school thought it was the coolest car ever.  But as for performance, I have a few complaints.  

   For one thing, the shifting is very sluggish (it's automatic) and it always has been.  I don't know if this is how all SUVs are, but on the Pathfinder, it seems almost like the transmission is not powerful enough to be carrying such a big car.  (If there's a technical term for that, I don't know what it is; I'm an 18-year-old girl who knows nothing about cars except how to drive them!)  The gas pedal is too close to the wall next to it, and too close to the brake.  I don't know the technical term for that, either, but if you wear big shoes, like I do sometimes, you can actually wind up stepping on the gas and brake at the same time.  Gas mileage is terrible, but that's to be expected with an SUV.  

   There are no rear audio or air controls, also.  In my mom's old car, a 1996 Nissan Quest (minivan), there were rear controls for the stereo system and air conditioning/heating (of course, the driver could turn off the rear controls if they wanted to); there were also headphone jacks so the kids could listen to music and the grownups could talk.  In the Pathfinder, it just basically sucks to have to sit in the backseat.  Even with the front seats pushed forward, there's very little legroom.  There are 2 flimsy cupholders, and the windows only roll down 1/3 of the way.  Plus, if you drive with all the windows open, there's a really irritating helicopter-like sound that comes from the air passing through the back windows.

   Maybe if they redesign the Pathfinder, they could put seats in the very back, instead of a cargo area.  The cargo area as it is, is too small to haul anything substantial, except maybe groceries.  But there's enough room to put seats back there, and move the middle seats back some so there would be more legroom. But I guess if they do that, it'll technically be another minivan.

   A few options that are unnecessary:  there's a programmable button for the garage door opener above the driver's visor, but it's nearly impossible to program.  There's a digital compass and temperature reading.  Not a useful temperature reading, like in the heating controls of the Ford T-Bird; it's just there to let you know how hot or cold it is outside.  I guess in case the windows don't work.
