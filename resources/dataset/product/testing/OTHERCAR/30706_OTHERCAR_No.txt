            I just had the opportunity to drive around a 2000 Pontiac Sunfire SE sedan.  I was not impressed.

The car I drove was equipped with the base 2.2L four-cylinder engine, making around 130 horsepower.  This engine didn't have nearly enough power to back up the car's sporty appearance, and liberal use of the accelerator to get any kind of motion out of the car.  My old Dodge Omni could pull better launches than this thing.  However, the one advantage to having a powertrain this gutless is the savings in fuel mileage.  This car averaged over 30 miles to the gallon, a very good number overall, but only a bit above average in this class.

Handling in this car was also unacceptable.  Its limits come early and often, producing tire squeal in turns at speeds as low as 15 MPH.  The steering feel was nice and firm, but the car's handling just overall felt very sloppy.  Brakes were about average, stopping reliably, but with a bit more distance than I would have expected from a car this small.

Inside the car, however, was an entirely different story.  The interior of the car was very comfortable, and roomy, especially for a compact.  The CD stereo equipped in the car sounded excellent, but the red illumination was very hard to read in the sunlight.

Trunk space was a surprise, providing a considerable amount of room to stash your stuff.  The overall appearance of the car was very pleasing.  It had a very sporty look, without a lot of the gaudiness of its big brother, the Pontiac Grand Am.

In conclusion, this car has a lot of potential.  It could be a very good car, but if you can't afford the high-performance GT model, I suggest you look elsewhere.<br><br>
