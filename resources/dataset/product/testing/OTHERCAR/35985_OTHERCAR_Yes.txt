            When my old 1985 Chevrolet Van began showing its age, and needing occasional repair, there was no doubt in my mind what I would get to replace it.

It was early in 1996, and I wanted a new one just like the old one, only this time a full ton van, not a 3/4 ton like before. My local dealer wouldn't sell me one! They were in the middle of a model change, as they do every 10 years or so, and they weren't making any of the old model, and the new ones wouldn't be released for a few months. I couldn't even get them to order one for me.

I saw the pictures they had of the new model, and I liked it. I searched around until I found a company that would order one for me, and have it delivered to the local dealer when it was ready. I couldn't even pick out the color intelligently, as they hadn't yet released the color charts. They did have the names of the available colors, though, and &quot;light autumnwood metallic&quot; sounded good to me. 

Finally, in August 1996, they released the first ones. Mine was the first to arrive at the dealer's lot. Well, it looked just like the picture, but it was HUGE!  

Huge was fine with me.  I wanted something big and strong (V-8, 1 ton) so I could tow a trailer with two horses anywhere there was a road. This one would do the job quite nicely. I also wanted something I could fit my 9.5 foot long kayak into, without anything sticking out. It did that job nicely too. 

I use it as a home some weekends, when I go to equestrian events. I have enough room to set up my bed, and store all my stuff, with plenty of room left over. I also keep a folding table and chairs in it, and use it as my travelling dining room.

Even though it's usually the biggest thing in the parking lot, I still have a hard time finding it. It looks just like every minivan in the lot. You don't notice how big it is until you get up close to it.

Speaking of big, I'm an average sized woman, and I can't come close to reaching the roof, or most of the windshield. I carry a step-stool in it so I can clean the windshield with a long-handled cleaner.

With the big V8 engine, it really has power. It can beat out almost anything at a stoplight (don't ask how I know that), and it just cruises up steep hills like they weren't even there. Sometimes I forget I'm pulling a trailer, it hauls so nicely.

It won't fit into my garage, so it has sat out in the weather for all this time. After 4 years, and 30,000 plus miles, it still looks almost new. The weather hasn't hurt it a bit. Only one tiny dent in it so far.

It does ride a little bit like a truck. But it is a truck, so I guess I shouldn't complain. 

When I have to replace it, eventually, I'll probably get another one just like it. <br><br>
