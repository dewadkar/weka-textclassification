            I must admit I blindly purchased this camera, Kodak DC280, without too much consideration.  I was looking into photography options for a website that I am working on which consists mainly of small detailed images of jewelry and charms.  

I weighed the options of a traditional film camera versus a digital camera and figured I would be better off going digital.  Reaching this decision was easy since I would save a bundle on film, and save time with immediate uploads to my computer.

Excitedly I rushed home with my new camera and quickly educated myself on its directions for operation.  The camera seemed simple enough to use and within minutes I was taking my test shots.

Immediately I became skeptical as to the sort of quality I was going to receive.  The 2 megapixel (1760 x 1168) resolution looked askew through the 1.8� LCD viewfinder.  Not only that but I was using the viewfinder as my main source of focus and coming up with completely different shots then I had hoped for.  

The LCD viewfinder made the images look bright (white).  The only people who I shot came out with �red-eye� and a bit blurry despite using this function on the camera.  I carried on knowing that I wanted to photograph small objects, the jewelry, and knowing that the digital camera shutters have a slight seconds lag.

The camera had trouble recognizing the software for the USB interface.  I was hoping USB would be available for faster downloads but I had to resort to the serial port.  Ah, the beauty of computing . . . options, options, options. 

The lens is a 2x optical glass zoom (the auto focus determines the zoom) and 3x digital (digital software determines the zoom).  The lens focal length is 30mm to 60mm equivalent.  Sadly, this zoom just didn�t cut it.  The charms that I had photographed were dark and grainy.  They looked horrible through the LCD and no amount of tweaking in Adobe Photoshop could enhance the picture image to my specifications.

The camera comes with 4 rechargeable Kodak batteries.  I burned through these in no time just playing with the camera and the instruction book.  Leaving the LCD on really drained a lot of the power.  In no time I was burning through the 4AA Kodak alkaline batteries.  These batteries seemed to serve more as an advertisement for Kodak batteries instead of their intended application.  I was chaffed to learn that the power adaptor was optional.  At this price you, over $500, would expect it to be included.  On top of this, the picture card door was weak and kept flopping open. 

I really hate to downgrade a product.  Especially one from a known leader in the industry but my experience with the Kodak DC280 was weak.  I expected more from the digital technology considering the price I paid.  I also learn that my needs would be better suited in the 3 megapixel range and eventually sprung for the Sony Cyber Shot DSC-S70.  While all digital camera aren�t without some hitch, at this point in the revolution, I am quite satisfied that I shelled out for this camera.    

I almost purchased the camera at Best Buy but learned that they have a 15% restocking fee on opened items.  This would have cost me close to $75 for my misfortunes.  I went next door and bought the camera from Office Max who almost refused to take it back until I verified my original reason for buying it there (Best Buy�s return policy) and my concerns for quality resolution.  The staff succumbed quickly, and buckled to my menacing, quivering left eyebrow.    <br><br>
