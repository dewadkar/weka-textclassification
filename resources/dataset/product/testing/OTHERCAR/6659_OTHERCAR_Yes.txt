            We recently purchased a 2000 Chevrolet Tracker and were impressed with it's handling capabilities, and it's roomy interior.  But unfortunately, the vehicle lacks one very important thing...power.

While driving on a freeway in New Mexico we never reached a speed over 55 miles per hour.  Due to 45 MPH winds in the opposite direction.  While other mid-sized SUV's, sedans, and full size vans, were passing us with ease.  Even the occasional 18 wheeler.  The roof-rack causes a lot of resistance if used.

The 2000 Tracker has a 2.0 liter engine.  This is a smaller engine then a 1996 Dodge Neon.  At the very least a 2.2-2.4 liter engine (like the s-10 pick-ups) would be more effective, and give the vehicle a lot more appeal to buyers.

Despite the apparent lack of power, the Tracker is a very good vehicle for a small family.  Well priced, and can turn on a dime.  We've enjoyed ours, and will look into buying another in the future...if the power is upgraded.<br><br>
