            I used to own one 1987 Jeep Cherokee with the 151 cubic inch 4 cylinder and a 5 speed transmission. Red with a black interior, air conditioning, 4 wheel drive, 4 doors, what a ride. I bought it from someone who said it had never used a drop of oil in 230,000 miles and he only wanted 1000 dollars for it so I thought I would buy it just to see. He was right , it used no oil, until I washed the engine really well and well the front oil seal started to pour oil out. After I replaced it though it continued to operate just fine and the oil usage stopped-shouldn't have washed it I suppose. The 5 speed transmission made a noise in 5th, but I understand this is the weak point for all of the Jeeps of this period, noone had trouble with the automatics. I recently sold it to a friend of mine and he is getting excellent service from it, he has added larger tires and a CD player, and shocks but other than that it just keeps right on humming along- shouldn't have sold it.<br><br>
