            Yes, I loved my Tracker. About as much as you can love any vehicle, I suppose.

Originally purchased because I was looking for a fun little get-around, with decent gas mileage, it also had the one quality that was a must in my life at the time...

See, I previously owned a 1992 Toyota 4x4. And while the truck and I had grown close, I seemed to have developed a problem of locking my keys in the truck. I can't explain as to why... something psychological maybe? But I had the problem anyhow. And while it wasn't the reason I sold the Toyota, it was a peeve.

The Tracker was a convertible with a soft top which made it fun in the summer just cruising around town or four wheeling at the lake... and yes, being a soft top made it <b>impossible</b> to lock my keys inside. There is a God and he made this car for people like me. Seriously.

It's light little four wheel drive body added to it's charm. I mean, who can resist barrelling through tons of sand at the beach, cruising past stuck vehicles. 

Winter was a test for it. I was afraid the lightness would make sliding more likely but I ended up having no problems venturing out on any given chilly, snowy, probably windy Wyoming day, when most people would stay home... afraid to take on the drifts. Sliding happened no more than with any other vehicle that I'd ever owned. Plus, it warmed up fast inside, despite the soft top. Another worry I'd had.

Now, I will say that if you are planning on driving on the highway and would like to hear your carmates on a smooth, quiet ride, this is probably not the vehicle for you. Being a taller model of a convertible it tends to catch the wind. And we definately noticed that the ride was more pleasurable when the top was down...maybe nice for a year-round sunny place, but not feasable in snow country.

They also warn that with the short wheel base you have more of a risk of rolling. I never saw it, but hey... I also don't tend to drive like a mad-woman (unless,of course, I am at the beach). But even with gusts of wind... and I do mean gusts... I never felt unsafe or like we might tip over in the least.

There just isn't a lot bad I can say about it, which leads me to why I don't have it now....

Why I sold it? I can't say, but I think it must have been temporary insanity. I want it back!!<br><br>
