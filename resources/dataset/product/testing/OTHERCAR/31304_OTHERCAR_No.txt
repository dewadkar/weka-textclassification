            A couple of years ago I drove and reviewed the 2000 model year 4.4 liter X5. This year I drove the base model, which shares an excellent 3.0 liter six with the Z3, 330, and 530. I wanted to see how the X5 rode on slightly higher profile tires, and how well 225 horsepower could move this 4500 lbs. truck

<B>Styling and Accommodations</b>

The X5 manages to be instantly identifiable as an SUV and a BMW, and still look near perfect. This is no mean feat. Porsche made a similar attempt to translate its aesthetic character into an SUV form with the upcoming Cayenne, and the results aren&#146t too pretty. Not only is the X5 attractive, but, aside from the virtually untouchable Z8, it may be the best styled BMW for sale in the U.S. Unlike the 3 and 5, it retains some of the edginess that used to characterize BMW styling. The well-integrated fender bulges are an especially nice touch. Unlike the 7 and Z3 coupe, it manages to be distinctive without being ugly. (Though this distinctiveness will take a hit when Chrysler introduces a very similar looking, if larger, Pacifica next spring.) 

Inside the X5 benefits from what might be the best styled BMW interior. Looking much like the interior of the 3 or 5, the X5&#146s interior possesses a few stylish curves lacking in the others. Materials are top-notch, putting the interior of the Mercedes ML to shame (and thus doing much to justify the X5&#146s higher price).

People buy SUVs in large part for excellent visibility, and the X5 does not disappoint. The seating position is high, and the amount of glass in all directions generous. The only aspect of the driving position I had a little trouble getting used to was the great distance to the fairly upright A-pillar. This recalled the truck-like view forward in large Isuzu and Mitsubishi SUVs. 

The X5 I drove this time had the sport package, which includes seats very similar to the supportive yet comfortable units found in the 3-series with sport package. Despite the slippery leather, these seats hold the driver in place through aggressive turns. If having the absolutely most comfortable seat is high on your priorities, though, the 4.4&#146s optional ($1,200) &#147comfort&#148 seats (shared with the 5 and old 7) are the way to go. I&#146ve never sat in better.

The rear seat provides just enough room for the average adult male. The cushion is high enough to provide a decent level of thigh support, though you won&#146t mistake it for the wonderful rear seat in the new 7. Unlike many SUVs these days, no third row seat is available.

A major weakness of the X5 is the amount of cargo space. I assume many people buy SUVs for their cargo hauling ability. There&#146s not much here, about the same amount you get with a small wagon. Even much smaller SUVs such as the RAV4 and Escape can haul considerably more stuff. Sure, we&#146re not talking Z3 levels of cargo hauling incapability here, but I imagine many SUV buyers would like more.

<b>On the Road</b>

I&#146m not an SUV person. I&#146m a car person who loves to drive. But if there was to be an SUV that might win me over, this would be it. Alas, even after a second drive I&#146m not among the converted.

The 3.0 moves this heavy vehicle suprisingly well. But that&#146s only because according to the laws of physics it should be a dog. Credit the transmission for generally making the most out of this engine. For most people in most conditions, it will be adequate. Most impressive is how quickly the X5 jumps from 40 to 60 when floored. The automatic downshifts in an instant, putting the engine in its powerband. 

The engine is actually less satisfying when less is demanded of it. Up hills, especially with the A/C on, it feels a bit strained. But enough with the nits. I actually found this powertrain annoying when gently dipping into the throttle to maintain my desired speed. Never could this be done silently. Given just a bit of extra gas the engine emitted a clearly audible drone. This might be the same engine whose noises scintillate me to no end in the Z3, but in the X5 I generally found its constant intrusions unwelcome. I&#146ve had similar issues with other SUVs, but wish that in this area BMW could have made the X5 a bit less trucky. If memory serves, the 4.4 is superior in this regard.

Handling is similarly a mixed bag. For an SUV (always that qualification) the X5 corners flatly. The chassis when pushed maintains the finely balanced feel typical of BMW chassis (save that of the Z3). This certainly appeals to the car guy in me. Even better, the steering is well weighted, and provides decent feedback. I&#146d even say it&#146s a bit better than the steering in the 530 I drove the same day in these areas (though I must admit that my higher expectations for the 5 may have played a role in this evaluation). 

Things get worse from here. The laws of physics dictate that taller vehicles, all else being equal, will lean more in turns. To make the X5 corner so flatly, BMW has fitted a stiffer suspension than that found in its sedans, even when all are equipped with sport packages (as those I drove were). Consequently, the ride of the X5 is considerably worse than that in the 5. (Though, if memory serves, the ride is a bit better with the 18&#148 wheels than the 19s.) Sure, over fairly decent pavement the chassis seems composed, almost making one wonder if BMW has cheated physics. Then a front tire meets a dip or bump it simply does not agree with, sending a jolt through the vehicle unlike any I experienced in the 5 or even the 3, and such illusions are shattered. It&#146s that truck thing again. 

Even when the roads are fairly smooth, the X5 somehow lacks the &#147all of a piece&#148 quality typically found in expensive German cars. Frequently through the wheel I got the sensation that various components were not joined as solidly as they should be. I get a similar sensation in my wife&#146s Oldsmobile Intrigue, but I don&#146t care for it there either. I&#146m not sure what the source of this is&#151perhaps some compliance designed into the suspension&#151but I wish they&#146d find some way to tighten things up without further degrading ride quality.

The brakes are strong, especially for an SUV. Too many SUVs cannot stop nearly as quickly as the average car, which frankly frightens me a bit whenever one is a bit close in my rear view mirror. The X5 is not one of these. That said, I found this X5&#146s brakes a bit mushy at the beginning of their travel, and generally would have appreciated a more linear response. 

I still have not tested an X5 off-road. But, like more and more SUVs, it&#146s not really meant for use off the pavement anyway. 

<i>Update:</i> See the comments for a rebuttal from an owner who has taken his X5 off-road. He says it performs well there. It seems that the electronic driving aids at least partially make up for the lack of a low range.

<b>Last Words</b>

Last time I concluded that I was not sure who this vehicle was for, and I remain confused on this basic point. Sure, there&#146s an obvious answer: Someone who just has to have an SUV for image reasons yet also wants the image and/or performance of a BMW. Beyond the image factor, there&#146s not a whole lot here to recommend the X5. In traditional SUV areas of off-road capability and cargo capacity the X5 does poorly. In non-traditional areas such as on-road performance it performs better than any other SUV&#151but still is no match for a good performance sedan. What about all-wheel-drive for inclement weather? Well, more and more cars, including BMW&#146s own 3-Series, are available with all-wheel-drive. For a combination of performance and all-weather capability, they are the better bet.
