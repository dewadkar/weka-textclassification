            I purchased my black Rav4 over two years ago.  I love the fact you sit up higher then the car I had before.  It's not like climbing a mountain to get in just is an step up.  Since I'm short it was perfect for me!  I however don't recommend this to taller people, since the back seat can be a little confining.  I have been asked by many people about my Rav4, how sharp it looks and what kind of mileage it gets.  I put easily 250 miles a week or more on one tank of gas.  I love how the back opens like a door, and the seats move down for more room. It's of course 4 wheel drive which makes going through the snow a breeze.  With the push of a button, you have instant high speed thrust. Since it's 4 cylinder that's a plus.  I recommend the Rav4 to just about anyone!!<br><br>
