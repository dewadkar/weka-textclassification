            I am taking the time to write because when I began considering the purchase of a minivan several months ago to accomodate our growing family, I had never heard of the Kia Sedona.  This is our first minivan and we upgraded from a Ford Taurus Wagon, which we loved, but which was getting cramped with two children under two, a dog, and the various required items required for even a short road trip.

I was skeptical about the Kia, and when I checked reviews on their other cars, which have been around for a few years, I was not impressed.  I should point out, however, that I had no bias against foreign cars or vans when I started my research.  My wife and I each drove the Sedona on a spontaneous trip out to the dealer one afternoon, and both of us were very impressed.  It handled very nicely, with a tight feel and great responsiveness.  It also proved to be quite zippy with great pickup on the open road.  Other writers and reviewers have commented on the comfort and features of the van, including numerous cup holders, so I won't dwell on those.  Suffice it to say I was not disappointed at all (in fact, pleasantly surprised and impressed!), and the comfort and features were all as good or better than described elsewhere.

My comparison test drives included the Honda Odyssey, Toyota Sienna, Chevrolet T&C, Ford Windstar, and Mercury Villager.  Most of the above were driven used, as we intended to buy a late model used van in order to save on depreciation, but I did drive a new Sienna as well.  All of the above have their pros and cons, but if you've been doing your reading/homework as well as test-driving in preparation for a minivan purchase, you know that NO van out there, new or used, is perfect.  The ones that I was most impressed with, the Odyssey, Sienna, and T&C, are all very pricey ($20K and up for late model used), and as time went on I was reluctant to pony up that kind of dough for a used van.  So I put the whole thing on hold for a couple months.

In the meantime, I was contacted by the Kia dealer and informed that they were running some special incentives, so I paid them another visit during my lunch hour one day.  By this time they had a wider variety of options on the lot, including the one I wanted: EX model with cloth seats, ABS, keyless entry, and a CD player.  It also came with a sunroof, which was not a priority, but has turned out to be a fun added bonus feature in the nice weather.  We finalized our purchase about two weeks later, and have not looked back.  We got $3500 on our '96 Taurus Wagon as a trade-in, which reduced our purchase price on a NEW Sedona EX to about $19K including tax and title.  We absolutely love our new van, and so do our kids.  Our 2 year-old has a MUCH better view of the world rolling by outside her window and can easily see things out the front windshield because she rides up high.  Putting her and her newborn baby brother into their seats is an absolute breeze compared to our wagon, and we ride comfortably and happily up front.  We are so happy to have made this decision, which could have been put off for another year or so.  But as time went on, we realized that weekend and family road trips would be much easier and more fun for all if we made the purchase now.  I attribute much of our enjoyment and satisfaction thus far to a good choice on the model of van we purchased.  And it has gotten 19 miles per gallon thus far, which had been a concern.  I highly recommend consideration of the Kia Sedona--it'll save you money and you'll be happy too.
