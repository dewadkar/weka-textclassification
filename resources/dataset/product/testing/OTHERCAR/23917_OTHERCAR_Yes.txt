            I own a 2000 180hp Quattro TT. I avidly follow the TT forum sites.After 4 month of ownership these are the pros and cons.
Pros: 1. This car attracts more attention than cars 3 times its price. There will come a time when this is no longer true (as more are available). 2. The styling is unique. 3. The car handles superbly at normal speeds (under 90mph) 4 The quattro really makes this an all season car. 5. Fit and finish are first rate 6. Great warranty and free service

Cons. 1. Although I have not had any problems many owners have had transmission (Front wheel drive cars primarily)problems. Electrical problems and problems with the Xenon headlights are also common. 2. The rear seats are useless. 3. The 180 hp version is a bit underpowered. 4 There are some handling problems at extreme speeds and extreme cornering. These are being fixed. 4 The optional Bose system is mediocre for the price.

All in all its a very unique car at a fair price. It should improve with time as it is perfected.<br><br>
