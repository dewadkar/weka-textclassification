That was just stuff you probably wanted to know about the car.


 I love the way it doesn't eat up gas in one day, its reliable and safe. It beats all the competition on other cars that but, cost a bit more than usual price for a sport. Its worth the money you pay. The way people notice you on the road means they respect cars like that. The way  it turns with no problem and the sleek of shifting what else could you want considering the civic ex or si.
