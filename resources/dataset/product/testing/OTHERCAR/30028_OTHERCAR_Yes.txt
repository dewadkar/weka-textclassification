            	I purchased the Kodak DC280 after reading many reviews about digital cameras and what was important when buying one. Things you should take into consideration when first buying a digital camera

	First you want a good amount of Mega Pixels, at least 1.3 and up.  Basically more mega pixel sharper and larger photos. Since the Kodak280 has 2.0 mp that was good, especially at the time.  Two years ago a 2.0 mp digital camera was about $599 to $699, now you can find a 2.0 mp camera for about $200 to $450.  Second you want to know how many photos the digital camera can hold.  The Kodak280 comes with an 8mb card, which is decent. An 8mb card can hold up to 100 photos at the least quality, and about 36 at the highest quality.  If you wanted to buy a larger card like 32mb or 64mb so you could take massive amounts of photos it would cost around $35-$60 extra.  Third thing you want to look for is battery life.  The Kodak280 has about a four-hour battery life (that�s with continuous use).  That gets really annoying when you try to take a picture and the batteries are dead (recommend buying extra rechargeable).  The batteries tend to die quicker if you use the LCD screen a lot, so try to avoid using it unless you have to.  Fourth thing you should take into consideration is the Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) screen that�s where you review you photos after taking a picture.  Take a picture and it shows up on the LCD screen and if you like the photo keep it, if you decide the photo isn't right or made a mistake just delete it on-the-fly (advantage over regular cameras).  The LCD on the Kodak280 is 1.8 inches, which is fine for reviewing photos.  Fifth thing is the software & camera connections.  The camera comes with comes with a set-up disc and a photo editing disc (for Windows & Macs).  Pretty simple, and it comes with a Universal Serial Bus (USB) cord which is connected to the camera and then connects to the USB port, transfers photos pretty fast.  

Amazon.com is where I purchased the Kodak DC280 for about $450 and still is $450, the price for the camera didn�t change at Amazon.com, and you can purchase it somewhere else for a cheaper price though.  When I ordered the camera, it came about a week and a half later.  It came in a small box with the following contents: Kodak DC280 camera , 8mb compact flash, 2 set-up disc., USB cord, serial cord, a lens cap, & TV out cord for viewing photos on the TV.  I inserted the compact flash card into its slot and turned on the camera.  I took a few test photos and viewed them with the LCD screen.  Then I loaded the 2 disc it came with, the photo editing software was pretty neat and the you can enhance, crop, cut, paste, edit, or just plain play around with the photos.  The photos I took were very impressive, very sharp crisp, and large.  The camera saves the photos on the 8mb card as a JPEG file (compressed photo).

About a couple of weeks later I found the battery life was pretty short so I purchased a extra set of rechargeable batteries.  I kept one set in the charger and one set in the camera.  So would always have some fresh batteries handy.  The Kodak280 has been running very well for me and I think it is worth every penny I spent on it.  I hope this review has helped you.  Thanks for reading.
