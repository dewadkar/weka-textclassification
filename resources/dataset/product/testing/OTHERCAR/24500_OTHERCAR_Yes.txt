            I purchased this camera to upgrade from my Sony FD7 that uses 3 1/2" floppies.  Wow, what a change I've seem.  The pictures are so much better!  I create PowerPoint programs and constantly take pictures to use for the presentations.  

This camera offers a variety of photo resolutions that the user can choose to best fit the need at the time.  I really like having the 3" CD-R's and CD-RW's since they hold a large number of pictures.  Generally, I use the highest resolution and get between 80 and 100 photos per CD.  There is also a mini movie feature that is nice to use for short clips.  

I'd rather have a better zoom, but the built in zoom is adequate for the most part.  However, this camera allows for optional lenses and zooms to be added as needed.  I have found this to be very advantageous for the type of photos I use. 

The jog dial allows users from inexperienced to very experienced to set the camera to fit your skills.  As an inexperienced photographer, I found this to be a helpful feature until I learned more about the camera... though, I'm sure there's much more I can learn.  

I have really enjoyed this camera and am pleased with the photos I have taken with it.  I especially like the freeze frame that shows upon taking picture, it enables me to know instantly if I need a second shot when doing posed shots. Snap and click away with this little baby!
