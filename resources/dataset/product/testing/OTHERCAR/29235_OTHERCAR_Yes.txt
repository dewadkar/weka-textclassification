            I drove a Dodge Durango and commuted every day to work.  I was killing my bank account with the gas consumption of the Magnum V8.  I needed to change my vehicle of choice.  I wanted to continue having some stowage capacity while decreasing gas consumption.  I used to drive a lot of people in my Durango (which I really enjoyed) but I don't have to drive so many people now so I didn't need another SUV.

So, I looked at the Toyota Matrix and Prius, VW Jetta as well as the Protege5.  I liked the idea of the hybrid Prius, but it was too small and expensive for what you get.  I'm all for environmentally friendly cars but it has to make sense in the pocketbook as well.  My calculations are as follows.  If I were to buy a Protege5 and compare with a similarly equipped Prius, I would have to pay an extra $10000 for the Prius.  Let's say that I save about $150 a month on gas on the Prius compared to the P5.  I would have to drive the Prius for at least 9 years to match the P5 to recoup the difference in price of the Prius.  Given the new technology of the Prius, what could go wrong in 9 years?  Would it cost more to fix?  Tough questions to answer right now.

The Jetta was something that I always liked.  The Jetta handled really well but the one I wanted was the 1.8T and it recommended premium gas and that goes against why I was changing the cars.  Also, it was a lot smaller than I thought.  The back seat was tiny.  The cost was also quite high for the car I was getting.

So, it came down to the Matrix and P5.  The P5 looked better and handled better.  The price point was better (although Mazda didn't move very much on the price and I know I can get good prices on cars).  The only thing that Toyota had in its advantage was its build quality reputation and 180 horses for the XRS.  I decided that my reasoning for a new car were monetary, so I went with the P5.

I picked it up in December and I have loved it ever since.  No problems what-so-ever.  Did not get the 6-disc changer (get better equipment for the money with aftermarket stuff).  But did get the moon roof and AC.  The build quality is top notch so far.  I live in British Columbia where it rains buckets and the Protege5 had no difficulties with wet roads.  There are days that I would like more power, but then I get the gas bill and I'm smiling again.

I was asked to update an give more opinions of the Prot5.  Well, the engine is a little buzzy when you accelerate hard, but it is very quiet when idling.  The engine gives a good pull at the low range, but it is the higher revs that you will find the engine lacking.  But that craving of more power is overcome by the handling capabilities of the car.  In a lot of cars you have to brake hard when you hit a turn, but you can go pretty fast into turns because the car handles so well.  The car feels very comfortable being tossed into turns.

The brakes are also very balanced.  In Canada, ABS is standard (I don't know about USA) an I liked how the ABS didn't always engage.  In my Durango, the ABS was always engaging even when I didn't think I needed it.  The Prot5 would let you threshold brake without problems.  Definitely something for someone who likes to drive a car hard.

Which brings me to the transmission.  It is a good one.  I wished it had the short throws that a Miata has, but it still pretty good.  It feels very much like a Civic's.  Under regular conditions, everything works very well.  When driving hard, the spacing is a little vague but after a little bit, you will get a good feel for everything.

In terms of the interior.  I was shocked to see how much space there was in the backseat.  I sat 3 six-footers in the back.  They were a little squished, but they weren't complaining.  Of course, with people in the back seat, there really wasn't much space in the hatch.  I think the hatch is a bit small, but what can you expect for a small car?

The driving position and front layout is pretty good.  Everything is where it should be and easy to reach.  The only thing that is bad is the cup holders.  Too tiny.  I like my big water bottle and the only thing that doesn't tip over is a soda can over small to medium Starbucks mocha (I'm from the Northwest :-)

There are a couple differences that made me want to buy a 2003 instead of a discounted 2002.  First, I like how they now have a leather wrapped steering wheel and shift knob standard.  There were also tweeters by the mirrors now, which allowed me to put in my aftermarket stereo components much easier.  I would recommend this car.
