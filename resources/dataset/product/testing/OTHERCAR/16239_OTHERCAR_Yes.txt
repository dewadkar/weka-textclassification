            My wife has a 1999 Corolla CE.

She  bought this vehicle because of Toyota's outstanding reputation for reliability. I read somewhere that the Corolla, over the last 30 years I think, is the best selling car in the WORLD. The Camry is number one in the US. Everyone else seems to buy the Corolla for the same reason I did. Driving around California, you see an awful lot of them

WHAT I LIKE: The gas mileage is really good. It get about 30 mpg regularly and we don't take the highway often. I've heard the 2000 Corolla has a new engine that gets more horsepower (about 5 I think) and gets better mileage. I stopped by a dealer last week and I think the new corolla gets 29 city, 37 highway.
   Even though the car is small, you don't feel cramped. I actually feel pretty safe and well-insulated from the outside world. I saw this accident one time where this Corolla got T-boned by a Ford Crown Victoria (a taxi) on the driver side. The driver was pretty shaken up, but the reinforcement beams in the doors work really well. The outside of the Corolla was smashed to bits, but the driver's compartment was perfectly fine. The kicker was that the power windows in the destroyed doors still worked after the accident. (although since the door was all smashed the windows only went down an inch)
   The seats have really good padding. They are really comfortable. The backseat is really roomy, but what I like is that the backseat actually has bucket-seat style headrests. Very comfortable again.
   The outside of the car is round, but not too round, so it has that 'cute' look to it. 

WHAT I DON'T LIKE: Nothing really. There are some personal things that stand out though.

1. The Corolla is really popular. In other words, you'll often see other corolla's in traffic that look EXACTLY like yours (Same color and everything)

2. I think this car was designed with utility in mind. The outside is cute, but it lacks the certain 'sexy' quality. For example, the Civic has that 'sexy' quality; the Corolla doesn't.
   The same goes for the inside. The best you can say about the inside is 'average'. There is nothing about the interior that is unique. Everything is placed in a practical place. 

3. The price is kinda steep. We got our CE with options like power windows and locks for $15,200, and that was with a $500 rebate. The upside is that since the corolla is so popular, you can probably find a dealer willing to sell them for a lot less. I've heard some people get a CE with power locks and windows for about $13,500.

If I were you, I'd get the CE. The LE is way too expensive and gives you options like alloy wheels and gold badging. The VE doesn't have much in it. The wheels look really bad and I think it lacks an overdrive transmission (i.e. the fuel economy is worse).

UPDATE 4/14/00

I was on a business trip last week and I rented a Corolla VE (I think it was a 1999 model)

I'm not sure if it was just the model I had, but I think that the CE is the much better value. The VE I had:

1. Had no clock. Just a plastic panel where the clock in the CE is.
2. Had really cheap upholstery. The cushioning and support was real bad.
3. The side mirrors on the doors were not adjustable. I'm 6 feet tall (average height in other words) and had to crane my neck down to really use the mirror.
4. Steering wheel did not adjust. Again, from where I was sitting, the wheel obscured the tops of the speedometer and tachometer. 
5. No power locks. When you unlock the front doors, you have to stick your hand around the B pillar to manually unlock the back doors.
6. On the CE, there is this thing where if you turn your key once in the lock it unlocks the drivers door and all doors if you turn the key twice. A very convenient feature that my VE did not have. 
7. I'm not positive of this, but I think the engine on my VE was noisier (growled more) than the CE engine.
8. No overdrive on the transmission.

Again, I'm not sure if the above reasons were inherent to the VE model or depended on the options that my rental VE had. In otherwords, I don't know how a comparably equipped VE and CE would compare. The only thing I'm sure about is that the VE does not come with overdrive and the CE does. 

Lastly, I'm not sure if its because I drove a lot of highway miles, but I got really good mileage.  I got almost 250 miles on 7 gallons. <br><br>
