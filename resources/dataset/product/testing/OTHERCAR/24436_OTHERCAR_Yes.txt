            I am very impressed with the Sony DSC-S50.  I use a variety of digital cameras at work on a regular basis.  The most common cameras are the Sony brands with the 3.5&quot; disk.  While they offer good quality photos, they are somewhat cumbersome to use due to there size and weight.
A co-worker brought in his new Sony DSC-S50 and after a brief 2 minute lesson, I was instantly hooked.  The picture quality is fantastic and the size and weight make it great for carrying around.  We printed some photo's with a high quality HP color printer with regular paper - if we would have used photo paper, I doubt that I would be able to distinguish it from a 35mm camera.
After a couple of weeks contemplating the price, I decided to order one since I was going on vacation soon.  
I would highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a compact, high quality digital camera.  My only hangup is the 4Mb memory stick - get at least a 32Mb stick if you plan on using the video feature.  Sony has a $50 dollar rebate on when you buy the camera and at least a 16Mb stick (ending early in 2001).
