            If you are in the market for a digital camera, the HP Photosmart C200 is a very good choice. It is easy to use and you can get it fairly cheap. It comes with a memory card, strap, and batteries.

Good features:
Easy to use, auto flash, auto focus, easy to use memory card, easy to carry, easy upload, easy to set quality, and you can review pictures before uploading, no film

The only downside to having a digital camera is the fact that the batteries will die real fast. I have used the camera sparingly for about 5 days and have gone through 4 packs of batteries. I put some rechargable batteries in it, and after that use, the batteries couldn't be recharged anymore. The only suggestion I have is to buy an AC Adapter from Hewlett Packard for $50 or go to eBay and buy a generic type for around $25. I bought a generic adapter on eBay and it works fine with my camera.

My Final Thought: Buy this camera because it is very user friendly and buy an AC adapter instead of wasting batteries!
