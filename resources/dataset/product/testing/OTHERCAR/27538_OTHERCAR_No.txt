            This 1996 Grand Cherokee is our 6th non-wrangler Jeep in a row. We first bought a Comanche pickup when the 4.0L engine came out, had three regular Cherokees, and now this is the second Grand Cherokee. Obviously, we like the Jeep line. But ............

We've driven this Jeep 100,000 miles and it's a good thing for us that we had the 100,000 mile extended warranty. What to do now , is as yet, an unanswered question. 

Probably somewhere over half of those miles have been towing a trailer that weighs about 6000 lbs. We've also probably put more real off-road miles on it than 98% of SUV owners. It is a goer! It looks kind of funny pulling a trailer so much bigger than it is, but does an excellent job at this task. It is a very good off-roader having garnered many comments such as, &quot;How did you get that up here?&quot;

For this much, and kind of, use this vehicle has some problems:
1. Full time 4 Wheel-Drive-only which puts a strain on the power train.
2. Very small front differential, which causes the ring and pinion to be smaller than they should be. 
3. Aluminum rear differential housing which, although it saves a little weight, has allowed the carrier bearings to spin in their mounts.
4. All of the above contribute to a troublesome noise that comes on soon after ring and pinions are replaced. 

I've had three rear ring and pinion replacements plus one complete differential replacement. I've had two front ring and pinion replacements.

The power train mechanic and the service manager at my dealership both have similar GC's and say that the problem is universal with the full time 4 wheel drive GC's. 

I've also had 4 Infinity stereo system replacements, mostly as a result of the CD player not ejecting the CD. 

Admittedly, we ask a lot of our vehicles, but we also paid a handsome price for it, and it is reasonable to assume that Jeep would get these power train problems worked out. <br><br>
