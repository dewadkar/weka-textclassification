            We use our 1998 Chevy K-3500 1 ton truck for hauling heavy loads.  Besides the added weight of our payload we also have a steel flatbed mounted in place of the original pickup box.  Incidently, we are at the trucks maximum GVWR when loaded.

Also this truck is used as a snow plow vehicle.  In the winter we install a Meyer Snow Plow on the front of this Chevy.  As most people know   plowing snow is very hard on a vehicle.

  Our 1998 Chevy K-3500 now has 59,000 miles miles logged on the odometer.  Most of these miles are highway miles, though the off-road miles racked up on it are VERY TOUGH miles.  Driving on twisty, rocky four wheel drive roads to remote areas is VERY HARD on a vehicle, especially when loaded down like our truck is.  Our 1998 Chevy Truck has never let us down yet, and that is important.  

  We do maintain our Chevy very well, so the chances of a breakdown are minimal.  Changing the oil every 3000 miles and lubing the chassis is a given.

  The following is a log of unscheduled maintenance performed on our truck since we purchased it new in 1998:

     1.  31,000 miles - New front and rear shocks.
     2.  32,000 miles - Adjust Rear Drum Brakes. 
     3.  47,000 miles - Cracked Rubber Boot on Inner 
                        Front Wheel.
     4.  49,000 miles - New front brake pads.
     5.  57,000 miles - Replace fuel pump. 

  As you can see from the maintenance, none of it except the fuel pump is out of the ordinary for the miles stated.  The fuel pump going out is most likely our fault.  The fuel filter should be replaced every 15-20,000 miles.  We neglected to ever change it.  So, the poor fuel pump probably had to work over time, thus shortening its lifespan.  By the way, the new fuel pump cost with installation ran us $560.00 !  So I recommend changing out your fuel filter as your manual recommends (this could apply on all makes of vehicles).  The cost of a fuel filter is a heck of a lot cheaper than a fuel pump.

  The choice of engine in our Chevy K-3500 is the 454 cubic inch V-8.  It is mated with a 5-speed manual tranny with  4:10 rear end gearing.  Power is very adequate.  Even when loaded down with a load the cruise can be set at 70 mph and held.  Unfortunately, the gas mileage is very poor, as can probably be expected from this heavy duty truck.  It gets about 9 mpg, empty or loaded.

  After 3 years of heavy use this truck still looks good.  The paint seems to be holding up very well.  The interior is still solid.  No noticable annoying rattles have popped up. I have been very pleased with our Chevy K-3500 truck overall.  And when it comes time to trade in our truck next year, I only hope we get another Chevy product.
