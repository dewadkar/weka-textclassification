            The newest camera to come into my hands, the Olympus C2500-L is a good, bordering on excellent, camera.

Aside from the TTL viewfinder and color preview LCD, the camera also features a larger than average LCD status display which displays the status of many of the camera's manual controls. The camera can accept both SmartMedia and CompactFlash Type I cards simultaneously. Finally, a camera strap with lens cap holder is also included.

Image quality is excellent for photos taken in well lit situations. The camera has three image capture modes, manual, aperture priority and programmed. In manual mode you have complete control over aperture and shutter settings as well as zoom, white balancing, spot metering, focus mode, flash settings, film speed selection and exposure compensation. Programmed mode is essentially a point-and-shoot mode with no controls except for zoom, focus, spot metering and flash settings. Final image quality is a little different from the quality shown on the LCD after capturing an image. Overall, I found the camera to be better than any other Olympus digital camera and both slightly better (battery life and final image quality) and slightly worse (preview images and ease of use) than some of its non-SLR competitors like the Nikon Coolpix 950.
