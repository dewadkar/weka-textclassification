            I set out to buy myself a digital camera in the $250 price range, and was determined to get as good quality as I possibly could - of course. My choice fell on this little darling, much because of its size which is conveniently small but doesn't feel like it's too thin and fragile either. The feature with the 180 degree swinging LCD screen so you can take nice looking pictures of yourself or around a corner, had nothing to do with my choice, but it is a nice feature.

I was amazed at first with its ease of use. It's point-and-click if you want it to be, but after exploring the menu items, and reading the manual a bit, I realized that it can be more advanced for those who wants to be able to get a bit more oomph out of their pictures.

The sharpness of the pictures is excellent, and the colors are bright and powerful. Sometimes, the LCD might fool you a bit - don't delete a picture you think might be too dark when you see it on the LCD, wait until you can view it on your computer.

I also like that it has more optical zoom than most cameras in its class. Digital zoom is useless in my opinion, and I could turn off digital zoom to ensure that I wouldn't end up with too pixelated pictures. 

There are so many features included in the camera, and I don't have time to write this review all day. Go to a photo store near you and check it out, or check up on the features lists on pentax.com.

I would recommend however to get some kickin' rechargable batteries and a bigger memory card. You won't regret it.
