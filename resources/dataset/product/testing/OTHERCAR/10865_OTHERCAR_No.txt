            I bought my 1997 Pathfinder XE new; it now has 42,000 miles on it.  It came with two option packages, one that gave me power windows, door locks and mirrors; the other gave me limited slip differential, fog lamps and a luggage rack.

The Pathfinder is not my every day car; it is my �snow car�.  During the week, I live and work in the San Francisco Bay area and drive a Mercedes Diesel.  On weekends I am on Ski Patrol in the Tahoe area.  So, no matter how bad conditions get, I have a commitment to public safety to be on the hill.  The Pathfinder has been great in this respect.  There have been days where I was the only one to make it up the steep driveway to my mountain condo late at night, hours after the last plow run.  While everyone else has to dig their cars out to get going in the morning, I can get away with clearing the snow to bumper height in front and to the ground a few inches in front of each tire.  I then put it in FWD Low and drive over the snow, no big deal.  I am always driving by other, stuck SUVs.

On the down side, the Pathfinder is thirsty, has poor ergonomics and terrible service point access.  Even coming down from the mountains, the Pathfinder does not hit 20 MPG, a round trip to the hill averaging about 17 MPG.  Nissan seems to have gone through a lot of effort to remove all controls from your driving line of sight!  The worst example of this is the master switch for the speed control, which resets every time you start the motor.  The switch is buried low and to the left in close proximity to the instrument lamp dimmer.  After all the time I have spent in this car, I still cannot place my hand on that switch without fumbling and often dimming the dash lights first.  The console cup holders are another example of bad ergonomic design, buried under the fixed armrest, they are hard to find without looking and only accommodate small containers.  No Big Gulps in the Pathfinder!

As someone who likes to maintain his own cars, I really hate the poor service access of the Pathfinder.  An oil filter change requires removal of a gravel shield secured with a dozen bolts.  When you spin the filter off, oil pours all over the frame members and half shaft boot, a real mess!  I made an apron out of aluminum to keep the oil off the half shaft and most of the frame but the job is still messy.  Another example is the cooling system.  If you look in the Nissan manual, it shows you clear access to the engine block coolant drain plug and the radiator drain plug, not the case when you get under the car.  The block drain plug is buried under engine accessories and the radiator drain sits directly above a frame member.  So, to flush the cooling system, I remove the lower radiator hose, which always results in a cleanup project.  Nissan recommends servicing the front wheel bearings every 15,000 miles.  This job is way beyond most do it yourself mechanics and from what I can tell, most professionals.  The Nissan manual calls for replacement of two O-rings and a cap in additional to two bearing seals per wheel.  I have yet to find a Nissan dealer with the O-rings and cap in stock, so I can only assume that the dealers are not following the factory recommendations!  The job also requires an expensive tool to remove the bearing nut (or a lathe to make one yourself, like I did).  I will not go into more detail on this job here but check it out in the factory manual before considering to tackle this one.  Nissan recommends that the front brake rotors be turned on the car, a service I have been unable to locate.  As a result, I have been plagued with a small amount of vibration when I apply the brakes from some speeds.

I do not feel there is any valid excuse for such poor service access and ergonomics in these days of computer design.  When I am ready to replace the Pathfinder, I will look at other SUVs.   Of course, I would hesitate to recommend the Pathfinder to others unless they too need to get there in the worst of conditions.
