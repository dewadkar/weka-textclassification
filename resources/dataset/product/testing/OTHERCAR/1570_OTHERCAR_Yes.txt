            I think the Dodge Grand Caravan is a great car for the average family.  It is a great value and the price is not very expensive.  The van includes a roomy interior, rear air conditioning, air bags, cassette player, automatic windows, and many more features.  These cars are great for family road trips, trips to the grocery store, trips to the mall, and driving your kids to their after school activities.  The van includes a lot of trunk space which is good for groceries, toys, suitcases, etc.  I think these vans are great for everyone with kids or without.  Highly recommended.<br><br>
