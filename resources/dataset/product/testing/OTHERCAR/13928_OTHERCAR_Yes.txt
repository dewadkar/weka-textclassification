                 It was a difficult decision for me to give up my 86 Chevy Blazer for a new car.  I loved my Blazer.  We'd been together thru thick and thin and the only thing that let me down was the paint job.  I especially loved the position of sitting up higher than the average Joe, and that gave me an especially secure and powerful attitude.  But facts were facts and it was time to let it go, so I perused my options.  Having just moved to Colorado, I was now facing a whole new way of life and the necessity for a 4 wheel drive vehicle.  Yes, the Blazer was, believe it or not, (no one in this part of the country could) a 2 wheel drive.  It was great for California highway driving and shlepping furniture around for my upholstery business, but it failed miserably in any kind of slick/snow/ice ...even heavy frost!  I discovered that the Subaru is a really popular car here, and I quickly learned why.  
     
     My first pick was the Legacy Outback, permanently in 4 wheel drive and 5 speed manual. I was spoiled with the fabulous cargo space of my old Blazer and wanted the option of flipping down the back seat and being able to load in a 2 seater sofa...or a few bikes, a pile of tents, a few backpacks, an ice chest or two, fishing rods, a large dog.  The Subaru could handle it, but I was frustrated with the extra step of having to first pull the seat up and then put the backs down.  In a sudden storm or blizzard I don't  want to linger with  my backside sticking out while I race to get the goods inside.  This hasn't really remained a serious complaint and anyway I'm not a whiner, so I got over that one early.  The front seats are a bit hard and I can only drive a couple of hours until I have to get out and stretch.  The back, however has great leg room, and split seats.  One can have a passenger in back and still have one seat down for a long object in the very back.  Great example...I recently bought a 6' trellis and was able to lay it flat and still have a kid in the other seat.

The next small irritant is the infamous cupholder....don't they all have to have one now?? I HATE mine....use it only when the teenager is threatening to spill sticky soda all over my upholstery.  It sticks out in front of the climate controls and--heaven help me--the radio!  I can't lunge for the station changer when I've allowed my sweet 14 year old her choice of music.  When the music turns baaad, I want to instantly switch back to NPR.  The flimsy plastic of the holder has me alarmed too, just how many super slurpers can it handle??

     Aside from those really unimportant nuisances, I love my Subaru!  It took awhile to get used to sitting at ground level and even longer not to cringe every time I drove over a larger than average obstacle.  Then I realized that the clearance is as much as the Blazer, and it's fabulous on any kind of road condition.  Most people around here live on dirt roads, and in fact my 1/3 mile long driveway would qualify as a serious
4 wheel drive only.  On the highway it's smooth, spunky and gets great mileage.  I'm still cringing at the thought of a being at belly level  with an antlered animal, but that's the only thing I would change if I could.  I've put 35,000 miles on this car and not a hint of a problem.  I went for the cold weather package which includes heated seats, heated outside mirrors and a sturdy cover to protect the underside when I'm ripping up the backroads.  I wouldn't take this car over any of our high mountain 4 wheel drive roads....it doesn't have the strength to get up and over some of those serious stretches.  I do feel very secure in a heavy snow, whether I'm on a back road or the interstate.  This car's a keeper.
