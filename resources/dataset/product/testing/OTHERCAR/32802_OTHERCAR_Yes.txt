            I live in an area that get feets of snow and work never closes down. So when my 88 escort got totalled in an accident I decided to get an SUV. 

The list:
I was considering Acura MDX, 03 4Runner, Highlander, RX300, GMC Envoy, and the Pathfinder.

The Acura dealer could not get a new one for 3 months and only had used ones(which I was considering) but wanted to sell it to me for about $3,000 more then a new pathfinder plus it had 24,000 miles on it. 

The 03 4Runner looked really nice but since it came out a few months ago the dealer said only at MSRP and he only had V8s

The highlander was smaller, no extra's (I wanted the AWD version) and wanted $2,000 more then MSRP because it was selling like "hot cakes".

The GMC Envoy had too many problems with it. I knew at least 4 other people with that had many "small" problems ie, knobs, wipers, etc....

The RX300 was a very very close second. the cons was that I couldn't get new one at the new pathfinder price, plus it was about $800 a year more on the insurance policy. It is smaller and could not handle a foot of snow.

The winner was the pathfinder.

The Reasons why:
Ride - very smooth and comfortable. the leather seats were extremely comfortable, and the 8 way power adjustable seats make it very easy to adjust plus with the presets, I just press a button to my position from when my wife drove it. Gauges and instrumentation was logically laid out. Rear entry was a little cramped getting in and the floor for the rear passengers seemed a little high but that is a trademark for the pathfinder. Automatic temp controls were nice but dislike the fact the air conditioner kicks in when you put the front defrost on automatic. Love the radio, cd, volume controls on the steering wheel. I never liked BOSE because their home theater systems are whimpy. I am a audiophile so I am very particular about how I hear my music. The BOSE system in the Pathfinder is awesome! I would compare it to Kef speakers in terms clarity and Carver Subs for the deep bass. 

Handling - very much like a car. Although the turning radius could be smaller, it was agile and responsive. Reminded me of the MDX. I don't know why Nissan didn't go with independant suspension in the rear. Instead they went with 5 spring multilink system with a rigid axle. So on some of the bumps you will feel. 

Power - tremendous power. It is very sensitive especially starting from a stop. It took some practice to evenly accelerate to higher speeds. Passing is a breeze and the automatic never has problems finding the right gear. Although on paper the Envoy had more power, the pathfinder felt it had better pickup. 

Exterior - It is sleek and refined. Not so contemporary that it will look outdated in a few years. Could be more rounded. The MDX won in this department.

Breaking - nissan put an ABS system in the pathfinder. it has dics in the front and drums in the back. I think they should have gone with discs in the back as well but I guess they had to save money some where. I thought that the RX300 had better breaks but it is also much lighter.

4X4 - it has an automatic 4x4 system. I put it on durning icy conditions or snow. I never felt it kick in but then again I have not slid and had great traction in snow. This SUV has a center differential so you can travel in 4x4 mode for long periods and at higher speeds. It also has 4Lo when your really bogged down, which the RX300 did not have. 

The extra's - the leather is worth getting if your going to keep the SUV like I am, until the wheels fall off, because it will last longer and wear better. the power seats and presets will avoid arguements and frustrations. I've always wanted a sunroof in a car. Tow hitch?... yea it came on the the one I got but I'm never going to use it. Roof rack will come in handy when I have kids (to put luggage not the kids) Heated seats are very toasty on cold mornings. BOSE system is a MUST! 

I got this SUV as a steal because it was an 02 and I bought it December of 02 and also I had a very honest and committed sales rep.
