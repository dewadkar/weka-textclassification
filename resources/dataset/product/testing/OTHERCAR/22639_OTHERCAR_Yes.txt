            I purchased my 2003 Honda Hybrid for $18600.00, which is about $1000.00 over dealer invoice (approx. dealer mark-up 5%, so not too bad).

I love practically everything about this car. I especially like the heat reflective glass, which helps keep the interior cooler. You feel almost no heat from the sun through the glass. This helps reduce the power required from the car to cool the cars interior.

The only slightly negative things about this car is some sun glare on the instrument panel, and an unimpressive radio. If you are a person like me who switches between AM and FM, you will be annoyed by having to constantly adjust the volume. The AM channels are too low for some reason.

If you are looking at purchasing this car, a few things to keep in mind:

1). Oil changes will be slighly more expensive due to the 0W-20 motor oil required. I have priced the oil between the dealership, websites and auto stores, and they are all charging between $4.50 - $4.80 per quart. The car holds 3.5 quarts of oil.
2). Honda recommends oil changes every 5k miles, and for some reason oil filter changes every 10k miles. Fram has oil filters available.
3). To change the motor oil, you must remove a panel below the engine, which is held in place by (9) clips. If you aren't very handy at this type of thing, you may want to have a professional do it. 

Anyone who drives alot of highway miles, like I do, will really enjoy this car. 

I highly recommend it !!!!       :-)
