            We were looking for a small vehicle that would hold it's value. We also wanted good gas mileage, reliability, and a nice style. Not having bought a new car for a few years it was time to look around.

I started by doing the research with car magazines, then moved to the internet looking at the car buying and comparing sites. I had my choice narrowed down to several makes, but the Honda seemed to be the best value for the money.

After shopping at several dealers (on line and off line), we came to a price agreement for the 2000 Honda Civic hatchback DX. We made the deal. Really there are only two extras needed for the DX. The first is really a necessity, air conditioning. The second is a better radio. Otherwise, the car has good pick up even with an automatic, and excellent mileage.

The doors are heavier then I expected. The interior has enough room to sit comfortably in the front, but not much leg room in the rear. The back seats are 50/50 and fold down one at a time. However, even with the back seats folded down there is less room than expected. The reception on the radio is not the best, which is why an upgrade is needed. I also wish it came in other colors 4 colors and one interior color is a little limiting.

It handles the road very well, and reminds me of the acura integra when it first came out in several ways. The seats are similar, the pick up is similar, and the handling is similar to what I remember.

I wish it had some other options such as power mirrors, ABS, and a light over the ignition key, but hey, it is a relatively inexpensive car. It holds the resale, at least the older ones do and there is nothing to make me believe this one won't either. I say buy it.<br><br>
