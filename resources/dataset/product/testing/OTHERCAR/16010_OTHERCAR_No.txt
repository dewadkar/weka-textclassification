            I recently drove a 2001 V6-equipped Camry for a week on business.  Let me say right at the start that the car was excellent through and through.  I wouldn't buy one, though, and would not recommend it to friends.  Let me admit that my lack of enthusiasm for the Camry has nothing to do with the car per se, but with the car's main competition.  The Camry was safe, quiet, comfy, reasonably quick, and pretty well-equipped.  It was also as dull as a refrigerator.

If all you value from your car is A-to-B transportation, then perhaps the Camry is a great choice for you.  I personally feel that it is too expensive to justify if all you want is to get where you need to go.  For the mid-$20Ks, I believe that a car should also get one's blood pumping a little bit.  The Camry's essential failure is the failure to excite in any way.

The Camry I drove is truly an excellent car.  It had a nice ride, all the essential features (nice radio, power windows and locks, roominess, good fuel consumption, etc.), and seemed as though it would run forever.  It was comfortable as well.  What it wasn't was fun.  Though the car accelerates briskly enough to merge into traffic unscathed, the Camry doesn't exhibit any joy while doing it.  Cornering was more Lincoln Town Car than it was BMW 5-series.  There was a significant amount of body and suspension roll, and the seats failed to hold their occupants firmly in place.  

If you simply want to get where you need to go, buy a Toyota--the overall quality and value were amazing.  I'd go for a Corolla, though, over the Camry as the Camry is priced steeply.  If you're going to spend 25 grand or so and need the bigger car, do yourself a favor and drive a VW Passat, the new Nissan Altima (which I admit to not having driven, but I have read very positive things), or a Mazda.  All three provide the same basic transportation as Camry with all the goodies and value Toyota gives, but you'll find yourself happy to be out for a drive.  And that would happen at no extra charge.
