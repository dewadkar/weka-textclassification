              I bought my 1996 Tracker used,in 1999.  I've since discovered, that it had been wrecked.  No matter, I still love it.  It's been in the shop once, because the &quot;CHECK ENGINE&quot; light was always on.  They fixed it, but almost immediately it came back on, and still is sometimes.  I think the light is stuck. So far this is the only problem I've had.

  Now I think mine isn't very good on gas. I have an automatic transmission, and it seems like I'm always at the pump. Then too, I think the gas tank is small.

  There's not much leg room in the back (ok for kids), but up front is fine.    I'm short, so never had that problem with any car.  The back seats fold down for groceries and storage, not too much storage, mind you.  And it can be a little awkward putting things in the back, you sort of have to become a pretzel, to manuever around the back window. Mine is a convertible, with a sunroof.  Opening the sunroof is no problem, but taking the entire top off is another story.  Comes off easy enough, but sure is a LULU to put back on. Afterwards it's kind of leaky (air) for a day or so, a few whistles to boot.

  I love to drive it.  I'm really cautious on sharp turns, therefore have never had the feeling of flipping over.  I think I love driving it so much because it reminds me of a toy. It's so darned cute!  Mine is black, with a little red trim. I also have 4 wheel drive, but have never used it.

  Though I'm 45 and still enjoy my Tracker, I would recommend it to younger people.  Someone who has plenty of energy,for removing and replacing the top.

I can't remember exactly, but I paid $8000 plus for mine.<br><br>
