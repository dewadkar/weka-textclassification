            <b>Tiny camera packs a lot</b>
In addition to receiving very high marks in magazines and reviews, what caught my eye was the camera's small size.  It is very light and small, and can fit in a shirt pocket.

<b>I've owned for 6 months, glad I purchased</b>
I bought my Fuji Finepix A303 in June 2003. Since then, I've been very pleased with my decision. I had my eye on this camera since Christmas 2002.  In the stores the price held firm at $299 since late 2002 - June 2003.  However I purchased mine on line for $235 and that included ground shipping.

<b>I take more pictures now then ever before</b>
<b>Update December 2003:</b>
Since purchasing, I've taken more pictures then ever in my life.  Digital photography is great!  I can snap over 30 high quality shots on the 16 meg card that comes with the A303, which is plenty for any day.  I can take more if I quickly offload the pictures to my PC. (A 2 minute procedure)

<b>What the camera comes with</b>
The camera comes in a small box.  It includes 2 AA alkaline batteries, a 2 foot long USB cable to connect between the camera and a PC, a CD of software and setup drivers for your computer, a short 10 inch camera strap designed to fit around your hand while holding the camera  (I recommend putting the strap on as soon as you open the box, so you can hold the camera better without dropping it)  Finally, it includes a tiny XD picture card, of 16 megabytes.  The 16 megabyte memory chip is enough memory to shoot over 100 pictures of a suitable size to send through email to friends, or around 30 large pictures suitable for printing, or at the highest quality setting it will store 12 pictures suitable for high quality printing.  

For those that don't understand what I'm talking about,  the camera stores pictures you take to the memory chip which is snapped into the camera next to the batteries. Later, you connect your camera to a computer's USB port via the included cable.  The Fuji software, which you loaded on your computer, will start up automatically when you turn on the camera and allow you to save or transfer those pictures to your hard drive. Just choose the "auto save" feature from one of the menu's.  It all happens in less than 30 seconds.  Then, you can delete the pictures from the camera's memory and go out and shoot more pictures.  You can also delete pictures, you don't like, from the camera itself to save memory between the times you connect to your personal computer and offload your pictures. If you have more than one XD picture chip you can swap the chips out when one is full, then later connect to your PC and offload the pictures from each chip.

<b>XD picture cards</b>
The XD memory chip is a new format being used in some digital cameras. The prices are coming down on these chips too.  Currently there are 16 megabyte, 32, 64, 128 and 256 and a recently released 512 megabyte XD cards for sale, so if you need extra memory for the camera, perhaps to snap more pictures on a trip when you don't have a computer to offload them, you could certainly purchase one or more of these tiny chips either now or in the future as prices drop.  The XD memory chips are about the size of a man's thumbnail and about 1/8th of an inch thick.  Higher capacity XD memory is on the way, and eventually these chips will be offered at memory sizes to store 8 gigabytes of data. Incredible!


<b>Batteries</b>
The camera uses two AA batteries, either alkaline or NiMH rechargeable batteries.  The camera ships with two alkaline batteries and I appreciated that.  Reviews state the camera is ultra low in power consumption, and one could stretch the batteries to take 300-400 pictures in a pinch.  

I realized after wearing down my alkalines in less than 3 days that the rechargeable batteries were the way to go.  
Invest in a set of recharable batteries if you own this camera.

I checked Best Buy but their prices were sky high, but found a better deal at Wal-Mart. $10 for a battery charger with two sets of NiMH batteries, or pay $16 for a 2 hour quick charger with 2 sets of batteries.  The higher priced charger has the added ability to quick charge in 2 hours PLUS charge off your car's cigarette lighter as well as house an electrical outlet. 


<b>Web cam</b>
One of the reasons I wanted a camera was to also use it for a web cam. I keep in contact with someone in another country and wanted the option of using a single camera for everything.  This camera does an excellent job as a web cam. I plug it in and start up Yahoo messenger, then click the web cam button. It works great.  Unfortunately though, the Fuji software kicks in and tries to run, unnecessarily. I turn that off and just use Yahoo Messenger for voice chatting while running the web cam.  TIP: By the way, you can do all of that on a simple dial-up internet connection and have two way voice conversations with friends and family while also sending pictures through this camera set up as a web cam.  If you travel a lot and want to set up a web cam to stay in touch with your family, this camera would be a great solution for you.  I've found Yahoo messenger to work well with this camera, it's a great free program.

<b>A/C adapter almost must have for web cam mode</b>
I recommend you purchase an A/C adapter for this camera if you intend to use it as a web cam.  If you run the camera on webcam mode, a fresh set of NImH batteries will operate the camera for a little over 30 minutes. The A/C adapter will save battery life when downloading pictures from the camera to my computer.  However, I can turn on my camera and save  a chip full of pictures in less than 2 minutes which isn't too draining on batteries.

Unfortunately an A/C adapter is not included with the Fuji A303 camera.  Many sites are trying to sell the Fuji adapter for over $50.  Again, I checked Best Buy, the prices were sky high, so I bought what I think is a better quality universal adapter, for digital cameras, at Wal-mart for $12.  The price on the A/C adapter, at Wal-Mart, was about 1/3rd the price of Best Buy's price or less than 1/5th the cost of the one's offered for sale on some web sites. (Perhaps other stores have as good or better deals, but it appears that stores like Best Buy have their adapters set as very high markup items.)  If you don't get an AC adapter, then get the fast battery charger like the one I mentioned.  


<b>Picture Quality</b>
So far I've taken about 300 pictures in addition to using it as a web cam. It appears the quality is spectacular, especially for well lighted or outdoor shots. Color correction was almost unnecessary in Fireworks or Jasc Paint Shop Pro, software programs which I use frequently.  I'm pleased with this camera's performance! The zoom features also are an added plus.  I've found I use the 2 megapixel setting the most and get over 30 pictures on the standard 16 megabyte card at that setting.  Even with the 16 megabyte chip that is included, that should be more then enough to snap pictures throughout your day.

<b>5 Flash modes</b>
The Fuji A303 has a handful of flash modes when taking pictures in low light.  Simply clicking the button on the back of the camera will toggle between modes.  You can set it to Automatic flash, Red Eye reduction, No Flash, Forced Flash and Slow Synchro (for night shots needing a slow shutter speed to catch a lighted background, use with a tripod)   You should experiment to get the desired effects.  I find myself switching the flash mode during the day and night.  <b>TIP: The red eye reduction really works, so be sure and use that for night shots of people unless you want your dog to look like the hound from hell and all your friends and family looking evil.</b>


<b>Self Timer</b>
The camera also comes with a self timer, to take pictures and still jump in front of the camera yourself or when you need to take a picture with a slow shutter speed yet not move the camera.

<b>Conclusion</b>
I'm pleased so far with my Fuji A303 and think it's a great buy.  With the exception of not including a A/C adapter and the lack of a tiny padded case, I think it's a winner all around!  Its incredibly small size, the use of readily available AA batteries and huge memory capacity, by purchasing additional memory chips, makes this camera a fantastic choice!
