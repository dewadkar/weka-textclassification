            I feel sorry for my family's Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited. You see, i was pretty hard on it. Surprisingly, it never whimpered. 190km/h? No problem. Almost removing the rear bumper with a ditch while offroading? No big deal. 
I was unsure how the 5.2L V8 would fair, but it trucks on. You'd never know how it's been treated. Regular maintenance at a four star Chrysler dealership helps, but it has to be a good vehicle to have lasted this long. My mother now drives it, so it doesn't get too many kilometers anymore, but the 70'000 that it does have, sold me on Jeeps forever. (i now drive a Cherokee) 
The V8 is not cheap on fuel, but it sure is fun! I have driven my friend's Grand Cherokee with the 4.0L inline six, and I have this same engine in my truck. The 4.0L is no slouch either and gets far improved fuel economy. 
Off road ability is often not a concern with luxury SUV's, but if you never take a Grand Cherokee offroad, you are missing out. Even with street tires, this truck will take you wherever you need to be. Snow is its specialty.
Living in the country where my road is rarely plowed, our Jeep has never once hesitated through drifts, or been squirelly in the slippery stuff.
Comfort is paramount in the Grand Cherokee, these seats would have made King Tut jealous. If you live in a cold climate, the heated seats are worth the extra bucks too. The Infinity gold stereo is best I've come across in any vehicle, including Bose equipped cars.
Handling is far and away the best in this class, unless you consider those little vans from Mercedes and BMW to be SUV's. 
I highly recommend this vehicle, and the est endorsement i can give it is that a dedicated gearhead like me will probably always drive a Jeep.<br><br>
