            We just purchased a 2000 Grand Vitara and we are loving it.  It suits all of our needs.  We originally had planned on purchasing a pre-owned Sport Utility Vehicle that was a couple of years old.  After test driving the used vehicles and figuring out all of the costs, we started looking at new Sport Utility Vehicles. We needed a 4 wheel drive vehicle, that would be economical on gas; yet we wanted something sporty.  We looked at every Sport Utility Vehicle currently on the market.  As well we did a lot of research and reading on Sport Utility Vehicles.  

We find that shifting gears is smooth and easy. The dash board is laid out in an easy manner.  The only difficulty I have experienced was locating the rear window wiper when I was hit with a sudden rain storm.  It is on the lower left hand side of the steering wheel. I especially like the storage drawers that are located under the driver and passenger seats.  

Everyone in our family loves the Grand Vitara.  I would definitely recommend it.<br><br>
