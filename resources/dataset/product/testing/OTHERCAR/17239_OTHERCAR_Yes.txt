            I have owned this car for about 8 months now, and have got mixed feelings about it.  It is a very nice sporty looking car, I just love the front lights on the car, and the best thing is that the body style is still up to date, it does not look like a 9 year old car.  

The good:
The interior is ergonomically positioned, everything is good within reach.  The leather is holding out well, no rips or serious damage, the only down side is that one small part of the driver seat string is coming loose, but this is easy to fix.  The steering wheel is very comfortable and smooth, and the manual transmission is also smooth, not jerky like some other cars I have driven.  
The reliability is also good other than some pretty minor things.  The engine has not had a problem it is still smooth and relatively quiet.  The car also has plenty of pull when needed.  

The bad:
Well there are several things which are not too serious.  First of the fluorecent display has one light that is not working anymore and it is very expensive to fix so I have to wait for more lights to go off to make it a worth while expense.  The windows do not have a door support go all around them, this is nice because it looks sporty, but it also allows more wind noise to come though the window when closed.  This is not a problem, no leaks or anything but can get annoying.  This can be fixed by using a silicon compound to make the rubber flexible again.  

This is a nice car, it is reliable, but you have to bring it to an outside mechanic, or to a Toyota dealer to get it worked on since Lexus clearly likes to OVER CHARGE Lexus owners.  Considering that a lot of parts in this car are the exact same as the Toyota Camry this is a ripp off on the part of Lexus.  (example 90k service costs $1200 at Lexus, and almost half that at toyota $650)  Both dealers do the same thing, and use the same parts.

Personally I prefer German cars, they are build more solid, and handle highway speeds much better, but you will end up paying more money for them on maintenance.  Again that is a personal opinion, the lexus is a fine car but personally I prefer something more heavy and solid.
