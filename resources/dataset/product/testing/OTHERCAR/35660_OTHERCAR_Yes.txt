            It's a strong person who can visit their Honda dealer to have a vehicle serviced and NOT look at the new models! I caved (of course!) and finished the day buy a replacement for my recently sold 1991 Nissan 300zx tt (which I owned for nine years). The new Honda Coupe EX V6/M6 is a beauty.
 
Exceptional front/side perspective. Very smooth with an excellent finish (one botched window-trim piece...being replaced under warranty...probably should have been caught in the pre-delivery check...hey, who's perfect?) The vehicle seems BIGGER than last year's model. But, in fact, it's about the same size. It is easier to get into (at least the front passengers...pity the backseaters!) than previous Accords, and the sitting position is very upright and in fact the car is quite a bit taller than the 2002 Coupe (I parked this one next to an '02...quite a difference). Older drivers (in a V6/M6?smile) will appreciate the ease of getting into and out of this sporty coupe.

Using the manual 6 speed transmission is a breeze. The clutch action is smooth and light. Shifting from 1st to 2nd can be a little dramatic to begin with...the engine is very quiet and you can sometimes find yourself over-revving and dragging the clutch...maybe just my poor driving?smile

Seating in front is outstanding...lots of support and nice size seat surface. The V6/6M comes with perforated leather. Reasonable quality...just. The seating arrangement is very comfortable and all guages/controls are easily manipulated. The steering wheel controls for the stereo system are good. I've read reviews that complained about them not being backlit for night driving...doesn't make sense to me...shouldn't you be FEELING the controls while you DRIVE the car?smile

The difference between the V6/6M coupe and a four-cylinder with AT was $1843. For that I got 17" wheels/tires, side-head airbags and a better stereo system. Seemed a decent value. This car is black (actually looks like super-dark blue in strong sunlight) and had a spoiler already installed. I had the windows tinted for around $200 (not the dealer) and the vehicle looks very good. 

For those folks who have owned Hondas previously, there are a few changes: the fuel gage indicator travels in REVERSE from FULL to EMPTY; the quick one-stroke wiper action is also REVERSED a la previous Accords...you push UP, not DOWN. Minor things...but if you own an older and NEW Accord at the same time, it's a little strange.
