            I purchased a used 1996 Chevrolet Lumina LS in 1998.  With the addition of two children, my wife and I needed a car to haul everyone around town.  I looked at a few cars in our price range (at that time $12 to $15K) including Pontiac Grand Ams, AMC Spirits, Dodge Stratus, and Saturns.  I chose the Chevrolet Lumina because it has a softer ride, quieter ride, more power, comfortable seating, and more room than the others.  I realize it's a larger vehicle, but it competed in that price range.

Overall, it has been a good car and served its purpose.  Our car has shown tendency towards electrical trouble, causing us to replace/repair one alternator, two batteries, and stereo speakers.

It has a good sized interior and good trunk room.  The keyless entry/alarm is a good option for convenience and safety.  It has a good sound system.

I also opted for an extended warranty.  I learned that Chevrolet uses and insurance company to hold the warranty, so if you have a dispute over repair/repair billing you will be forwarded to that insurance company.  I was disappointed with Chevrolet's customer service.  I had negative experiences waiting for them to repair warranty and non-warranty items.  They needed at least twice their estimated time to repair the vehicle, and rarely called me with updates they told me would occur.

I recommend the vehicle, but buy one with low mileage.
I still recommend the extended warranty service for financial security, unless you will repair the vehicle yourself.  Just realize the difficulty you may have with any disputes during repair.<br><br>
