            I bought my 2001 black Elantra in March of 2001.  I had been driving a 1991 Nissan Sentra for the past 3 years and it was about to grind to a halt.  I had been looking for a used replacement, but the Elantra seemed like a great quality car at a good price, so I bought it.  For the most part, I've been very happy with it.

THE GOOD NEWS:
First of all, the price was great (I paid around $13,500 for an automatic with a couple of options).  The car runs well and feels solid. I LOVE the way it looks- people have mistaken it for a Passat and even (gasp) an Audi.  It already has over 13k miles on it, and it drives like it's brand new.  Last weekend I packed 4 adults into it (including 2 men over 6'2") for a 5 hour trip and while it was a little cramped, everyone was comfortable.  The truck is monsterous- I can't believe how much stuff I've jammed in there.  I get great gas mileage (14 gallon tank, so I fill up every 350 miles and pay around $16.00 per fill up).  There's a funky sunglasses holder in the ceiling which is my husband's favorite luxury.  The cupholders are big, there are little storage spaces everywhere for change, speeding tickets, etc.

THE BAD NEWS:
When I first got the car I was told that you had to be very careful with the gas cap or the check engine light would come on and stay on for two days.  My check engine light was on quite a bit, no matter how I followed the directions.  I finally found out that the gas cap was defective.  They replaced it at no charge under the warranty.

My brakes had been making a strange clunking sound for the past 5k miles or so- I thought it was something in the trunk but finally decided to have it checked out this week.  They needed to do something to the lining of my brake drums (I have no idea what) but they fixed it under warranty. Yay!

This car scratches if you even LOOK at it wrong.  I've scratched it with a grocery bag.  If you even brush up against it, the paint gets scratched.  These scratches show up very clearly with my black car, and I get really annoyed every time I find a new one.  It also dings fairly easily (I've had a dent from a rock on the highway and a paintbrush that got tossed towards the car and accidentally hit it- oops).

My biggest problem with the whole Hyundai experience was the dealership.  I bought my car from the Hyundai dealership rated #1 in Customer Service in the country- and quickly found out why.  The salesman had me fill out a survey to send back to Hyundai headquarters about my buying experience, and he cautioned me for a good 10 minutes about what I said on the survey. He told me that if I rated ANY question on the survey at less than 100% satisfied, he wouldn't get paid for selling me the car.  Once he cautioned me about the version of the survey I got at home, he pulled out the copy I was supposed to fill out when I purchased the car and answered all of the questions himself.  He would say "I know I took care of you on this one, so I'm marking it 100%".  I found it amusing but later got insulted by it.  

When I received the home copy of the survey, I gave 100% on all the questions but included a note of response stating how unhappy I was with the practice.  I also was called by Hyundai headquarters to see how I liked the car and told them the same thing.  They tracked down the owner of my dealership who called me and had me come in to sit down with the salesman, in a closed room in the back.  It all seemed a little mafia-esque, but the salesman listened to me and I left feeling like nobody was going to bomb my house.

on the up side, once Hyundai learned I was unhappy with the dealership they were VERY interested in helping me out and fixing the problem.

IN CLOSING
I'm not 100% in love with my Elantra, but I am very impressed with it.  It's been through a lot in the past few months and I think it was a great purchase.  I would recommend an Elantra to anyone looking for a good quality, low price car that has a good warranty and DOESN'T look cheap.
