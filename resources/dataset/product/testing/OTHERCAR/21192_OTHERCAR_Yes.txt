                 I purchased my 1997 Geo Metro at a dealer auction in August of 1999.  I was returning to school and needed a more reliable vehicle than my twenty year old station wagon.  As the purchase was made at auction, my choices were limited and the Metro was definitely not my idea of what a car should be.  However, I overlooked its shortcomings (diminutive size, underpowered) and placed my bid.  Lucky for me, I was the highest bidder.  I have now owned my Metro for ten months and have put approximately 9000 trouble free miles on it.  I have always owned V8 musclecars in the past, so the Metro's acceleration leaves much to be desired.  It more than makes up for this with its good mileage, easy parking, and thus far maintenance-free driving.

     The Metro has seats that are hard as bricks and the engine is louder at highway speeds than a V8 with glasspacks at 3000 rpm,but its surefootedness on snow and excellent handling have made me glad that I purchased the vehicle.

     The Metro is an excellent car and I would recommend it to anyone.  While there are few creature comforts, the car is an excellent value and has proven to be a solid school car. <br><br>
