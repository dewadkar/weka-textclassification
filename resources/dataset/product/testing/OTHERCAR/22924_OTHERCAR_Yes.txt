            Maybe it's a guy thing-- doubtful. Maybe it's a fun thing-- definitely. Whatever the thing is, you've got to get it! My dad own's a 1995 Wrangler and besides the gas it uses, to me, there is not one thing wrong with this car. Sitting higher than everything but Semi's, you feel and see part of the bigger world-- be wary of trying to step in, it takes some getting used to for some people, but being over 6'2&quot;, I have no difficulty.

The 4 wheel drive capability is the best in the snow-- but don't expect to climb Everest with it though. Granted, this is not your everyday family car, although I must admit that at 6'2&quot;, it does seat surprisingly comfortable in the rear seats. But the summer with the top down and the half doors on (make sure you get the one with the half doors and not the roll down window doors), you are guaranteed to have a great time-- and a messy hair-do. And for the winter time, the heater works immensely well, better than my Grand Am. Seriously, the heater kicks out a lot of heat to keep you warm in a less than air tight car. 

The price is also just right for a first car for a teenager as well as a toy car for the teenager at heart. This a no frills car, but you cannot help feel like a million bucks while driving. I have been in the Jeep for a 4 hour road trip and found the ride comfortable, but mostly enjoyable from the unobstructed view on a bright summer day. Now go get yourself that Jeep.
