            <i>This review is part of a write-off in memory of epinionator roadiem, also known as Mike Lambert. I learned a lot from Mike in the short time I knew him: about perseverance, social decency, the importance of family, and of course, many things automotive. The most important lesson I learned, though, was to always try to reach beyond my grasp.</i>

In many ways, my car is like me. Not new by any means, it'll still go a couple more miles down the road if treated right. My car's looks have never been anything to write home about, but nobody makes that gagging gesture as we drive by either. The best that can probably be said is that it <i>blends</i>, and I like that just fine. 

I bought my little black Bonneville a couple of years years ago with 114,000 miles already on it. (It now has 131,000 miles and is still going strong with no real problems.) My mechanic, who also happens to be my spouse, checked it out first (always a good idea with a used car, of course) and pronounced it both structurally and mechanically sound. 

In addition to the reasonable price ($4000) he also liked the way the "innards" were arranged. Many cars apparently require removal of the battery to change the oil, the use of a funnel hose to fill the windshield washer reservoir, or otherwise having to deal with the kind of design "quirks" (not quite the word he used) that make it annoying for a formerly professional, now driveway, mechanic like him to maintain a vehicle. 

With a 3.8 liter V-6 engine, which I am told is middling-big for a car this size, it has power to spare. There was a supercharged option on this model, but my car doesn't have, nor in my opinion, need it. I'm no drag-racer (well, not lately) but I do live in a city where most people take the highway to go to the grocery store. 

The highway/tollway system in Chicago is big, fast and crowded. So when it comes time to merge into four packed lanes of 70 mile an hour traffic, and the entrance ramp runs up a short, steep slope, I want to know exactly what my vehicle will do. My car does everything I need it to.

The gas mileage is just okay, 17-25 mpg, but with the lack of a car payment and an only occasional routine maintenance cost, this car is pretty economical to operate, at least for me. 

Some of the things I really like:

The dash is easy to read. Though some reviewers are offended by the red lights of the instrument panel, I find it easy on the eyes. It is not too bright a red, more like a crimson/dark orange. Of course nine years ago, when we were all a little brighter, it might have been a more obnoxious hue.

The climate control system is simple and civilized. It allows me to control the temperature, direction and intensity of the air coming at my face. Some of the rental cars I have driven seem to have been designed by people who apparently think I am too stupid to know how to set the heat or air in my own car, so they leave it up to a computer chip. Somehow, those computers and I just never seem to agree on what the temperature should be. Since I spend enough time at home, arm wrestling for the thermostat with certain teenage housemates of mine who insist on wearing swimwear in January, I like to be solely in charge of the air in my automobile, thank you very much.    

Comfy, too are the seats. Because I enjoy driving, it is not uncommon for me to take a quick (six hour round trip) drive downstate to have dinner with my sister, and come back the same night. I honestly don't know if I could do that as often as I do, if my car wasn't as amazingly comfortable as it is. Something about the seats -- you just never feel tired, whether you are driving cross-country, or just running down to the hardware store. 

Speaking of which, I really appreciate the size of the trunk on my car. It is huge, big enough to fit whatever you are hauling -- a foursome's worth of golf clubs, three teens acting goofy (uh, not recommended okay?) two weeks worth of groceries, or a bird house and a Bradford-pear tree (ball and burlapped, of course.) 

For even more space, anyone handy with a socket wrench can remove the back of the rear seat to extend the trunk space into the cabin of the vehicle.

A couple of things I am not so crazy about:

Stupid, crappy, messy, non-functioning cup-holders. You get the picture.

Um, let's see. Okay, the rear window is situated on a slant since this is supposed to be a sporty (or sporty-ish) car after all. But when I drive in a blizzard, the snow accumulates on the window faster than I can defrost it. 

Guess I'm kind of reaching here, but frankly there just isn't much about my '93 Pontiac Bonneville not to like. Me and my car: we're old, we've been around the block a few times, we're low-maintenance, no-frills, hard-working and kind of comfy. What's not to love? 

<i>Many thanks and fond memories go to Mike "roadiem" Lambert; the dude knew how to treat cars and life, friends and family. I'll never forget him. 

Oh and by the way, roadiem's rule #2 for owning a car with 100,000+ miles on it: always keep a cell phone with you when you drive, because sometimes things just don't turn out the way you expect.
