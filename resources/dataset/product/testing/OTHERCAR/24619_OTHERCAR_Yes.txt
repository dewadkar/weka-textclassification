            If your looking for a sports car but yet want your family to fit in it � here is a car that should be in your garage.  It�s fast, and you can fit the kids in the back with no problem.  It gets you around town with the utmost ease and quickness.  If you need to stand on the gas, get ready for a quick take off.  Once you�ve reached high speed the power assist steering tightens right up for a better feel and control � slow down and it loosens back up (a very nice feature).  Just want to go out for a Sunday ride, open up the power sun roof and enjoy the great outdoors, or do you just want the breeze and not the sun, just pop up the sun roof vent.  Overall a great cruising car!

If I had to jot down my favorite features, at the top of my list would be looks and then the power and feel of the 3.0 liter/210 horse power/DOHC V-6 power plant.  The 4 wheel independent suspension helps hold this fast car to the ground and give you a smooth ride. Cornering at high speeds  you feel very little roll.  The interior is very comfortable and convenient, with an attractive leather and wood appointed touch.  The dash is simple and not over done with gadgets � very pleasing to the eye.  This car has been virtually maintenance free, getting the oil changed and having the regular checkups done are basically all we go the garage for.  Love the keyless door opener which opens the truck as well � a life saver when your hands are full and you need to get in the trunk.  This car comes standard with just about anything you would ever want or could think of adding.  I think the only option is the built in cell phone. I could go on, but I think your getting the picture.

Ok, now for what you�ve been waiting for, the bad list and it's not much � this is my wife�s car and if you asked her you wouldn�t get a list.  Now, I have some things that bother me.  To start with, I am 6 feet tall and weigh about 200lbs.  When I get in this car the first thing I have to do is put the seat back � way back, almost touching the back seat.  So, if some one other than my little girl was to sit behind me I would have to compromise my space to provide them with the room needed just to get in the car.  Got the picture?  Yes, it�s not the biggest car, so all you big people out there look elsewhere.  Did I say my wife loves it?  The noise that the self adjusting brakes make � it sounds like the front end is coming apart.  Although the dealer assures us that it�s quite normal, it still bothers me.  That�s about it, I told you not to expect much.

This car is Ideal for the busy mom with one or two small kids.  Or, the busy man on the move with long business trips to make � he will have plenty of luggage space in the trunk and room left over for that set of golf clubs.  The gas mileage is average to good, we get about 17 city and 25 hwy.  Your friends will look twice and want to test drive it.  I give this car a big thumbs up.
