            We have been researching minivans for the last nine months.  After several test drives, lots of online research, and many word-of-mouth recommendations, we bought a Mazda MPV LX.  To begin with, anyone looking to buy a minivan has got to seriously consider ONLY the foreign models.  Check Consumer Reports and you will find that the popular Ford Windstars, Dodge Caravans, Chrysler Town & Countrys, and all other American made vans have very poor reliability and subpar fit and finish.  The foreign minivans, including the Toyota Sienna, Honda Odyssey, Nissan Quest, and Mazda MPV are the only minivans rated as Consumer Reports Best Buy models.  Everyone we knew with an American made minivan had problems with it mechanically.  

We started out looking at the top four vans.  We loved the Toyota Sienna, but comparably equipped to the MPV, it costs about $6,000 more.  Not to mention, they are in such hot demand you will easily pay sticker price (or more if there is a wait list in your area).  The old reliable Honda Odysseys were very nice, but I was tired of seeing them everywhere...and their body style is 6 years old, so even the newest models look tired.  And again, their sticker price is easily $5,000 about the Mazda.  That brings us to the Nissan Quest.  Newly restyled, the Quest is a nice car and well designed.  Two problems:  the interior dash layout is ugly and resembles some Star Wars machine, and they too are priced way above the MPV--$4,000 more for the base model (which lacks lots of the options we got on the MPV).

The Mazda MPV LX that we have has dual power sliding doors, cold weather package, rear bumper step plate, rear heat and a/c, and a 6 CD in-dash changer with Bose speakers.  We paid $20,275.  Just try those options on another minivan and watch the price climb.  Mazda was offering a $2,500 cash back on their 2003 models, and 0% financing on their 2004 models, so do your research.  Because the Mazda MPVs aren't as "hot" as the Toyotas and Hondas, you have a lot of bargaining room with the dealer.

Now, considering how much money you save on this van, it is incredibly well equipped.  The engine and ride are excellent, it is easy to drive, park, and turn, even in tight quarters.  The interior is well laid out, and the dual power doors are excellent--you can open and close them from the driver's area, the passenger area, the key remote, or from the door handle itself (touch it and it slides open).  This makes an incredible difference when you're loading three kids in the car--hands free!  The second row seats are well laid out--they slide together or apart, and slightly forward or backward with one hand.  The seats are equipped with the LATCH system which makes car seat installation a snap.  The third row seat folds flat into the floor, leaving an excellent amount of cargo space.  This third row does not split 60/40 like the Toyota does, but that hasn't been an issue for us at all; unless you're used to that feature, you don't miss it.  One excellent feature of the MPV is that the rear windows slide down like in a car.  The only other van that does that is the Sienna, and it is great when the kids are riding back there and need some air.
