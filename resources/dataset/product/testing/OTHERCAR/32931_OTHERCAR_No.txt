            I would recommend that someone truly interested in a sports car not look at this car.  Although it is fast and does in fact accelerate well, the whole tour/sport selection feature is a waste of money.  Also the all wheel drive is useless and has problems.  I have had no success with this car in any type of hazardous condition.  The all four wheel turning does in fact work, but makes such a minimal difference that you wont notice.  I can say that the vr-4's twin turbo boosters make a huge difference.  They are all that make the car.  If u want to purchase it i highly recommend getting that model, if u want anything less go for the eclipse the body of this car isn't worth the price.  Also the active aero spoiler constantly gets stuck and with speed limits on street roads never really goes up to even make a difference.  <br><br>
