            I LOVE Toyotas and especially Land Cruisers, but HOLY COW! Did you see the sticker price?!?!?!? Why buy the worlds greatest 4X4 when you wouldn't dare to take it off of a paved road? I don't know about the rest of you, but if I had leather seats in my 4X4 I'd have to replace them every year. I know, most people that buy the new Land Cruisers don't take them off the pavement, but that is like buying a 100 room house and never leaving the bedroom. Why not get it out and exercise the beast?

The 4.7L DOHC V-8 puts out 230 horses and muscles 320 lb-ft of torque, has Full-Time 4WD, clears all obstacles that are under 10 inches high, tows 6,500 lbs, and drives like a dream. That translates into $45,000 to $50,000 dollars of unused equipment if you just drive it on the regular road. If you just want to drive back and forth to work and the grocery store, then buy a Camry. It drives even better and it saves you about $20,000 on the sticker price alone.

HEY!! Where is the 5 speed?!?!?!? Only AUTO??? UUUGGGGGGGGG!!!!!!

I drool when I see a Land Cruiser driving on the road, but then I cringe when I see that the truck has obviously not seen a day of real off-road use. The trucks have been designed to do this since the mid sixties.

My advice, drool on 'em in the showroom, but put your money into a vehicle that suits your needs.
