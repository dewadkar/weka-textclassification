            The Corvette Hardtop is very hard to beat when it comes down to bang for buck. Weighing less than the Coupe or Convertible models while using the same power plant provides better low and high-end acceleration. Since the hardtop is a fixed roof vehicle, handling is better than its siblings too. AND...it's less money! You don't get all the frills but you do get the racer-boy performance model. A 6-speed manual is standard (an $850 OPTION in Coupe or Convertible!) as is the Z51 performance suspension. Now to the subjective: The car is not without its quirks. The shifter is stiff and metallic; the gas gauge is not constant - reads up or down 1/8 tank between drives; The brakes are prone to squeak and the headlights dim for a fraction of a second for no apparent reason every so often while driving. However, the car is one of the most balanced handling cars on the street - in the league of the Porsche 911, and Acura NSX. The acceleration is well under 5sec to 60mph, again - in very limited company. Power delivery is silky smooth and the distribution range is HUGE (i.e. 1st is good to 52mph, 2nd will get you to 80, 3rd is good for an easy 115, 4th will take you to 150+mph. 5th will take you the rest of the way to the aerodynamically limited 172, +/- 1mph). Unmodified, this car is an unbeatable value at around $40k. You better get one this year, as the Z06 will replace it in '01 and it goes for $49k. You do get a lot of extra performance in the Z06 but at 50 big ones, it no longer sits in the budget exotic throne. Having only owned a C5 Hardtop, and never really considering a corvette prior, it has my highest recommendation.
