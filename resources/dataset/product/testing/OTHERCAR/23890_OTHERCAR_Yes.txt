            I bought a used 1995 Millenia S. It has been a great car and they are extremely good values in the used market at between $12,000 and $16,000. Nowhere can you get as much car as you can with a Millenia S.

The car is fast, although sometimes inconsistent in acceleration. It is well engineered and excellently assembled. It handles very well. The interior is comfortable, the Bose Stereo is nice, and the car drives extremely well.

It has its problems though. The Millenia is not a quiet car. The road noise inside can be annoying on uneven pavement. It has million-multi-way seats, but no memory. These seats are next to impossible to get back to your favorite position after your spouse drives the car. The body also has a completely exposed beltline, with no bumperettes or rubber protection strip. This makes the car extremely suseptable to parking lot dings. The trunk lid also dumps rain water right into the trunk, when opened in the rain.<br><br>
