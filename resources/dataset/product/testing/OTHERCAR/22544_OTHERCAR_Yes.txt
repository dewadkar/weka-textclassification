            I was looking for a four door family car when I ran across 
a '98 Monte Carlo LS with under 10k miles with a very reason-
able price and tested it, and was impressed with the ride and 
handling,however, I was most impressed with the power that
was generated from the V6 engine.  The Monte Carlo base engine
is much stronger than the base engines of its competition and
a much higher price would be paid to get comparable power.
Shortly after obtaining the car I took a 3000 vacation trip and 
and found that I consistently got 28-30 mpg on each tank of gas
at 75 mph on the interstates.

After driving it for 15 thousand miles I am continually impressed 
at the quality in all areas.  This should be listed a best buy in view
of what you get for your money.  For some reason this car does not sell 
well and you are able to get discounts and rebates that reduce the 
price of the car to well below the competition.  I highly recommend that 
anyone in the market for this type of car take it for a ride and compare
it to the competition.<br><br>
