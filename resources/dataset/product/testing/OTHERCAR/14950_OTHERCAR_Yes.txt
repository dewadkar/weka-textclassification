                 I am not (yet) an owner of an FD73, so it may seem odd that I'm writing a recommendation for it. I sell stuff on eBay, and in order to have an image of my items, I bought a Kodak DC10 a few years ago; nice pix, but very limited in the zoom and closeup requirements.
    
 My friend, however, has a Sony FD73, and In helping him with lighting and backgrounds, I came to discover how useful the camera really is, and I borrow it frequently.
    
 The zoom range is 10 to 1; from wide angle to true telephoto. The lens focuses (very sharply,too) to 1/2 inch from your subject. I've taken pix of a coin in one frame, a large camera on the next, and shots of damage done to my neighbor's house on the following shots, without any changes or additional accessories. Itis also useful for taking pictures of valuable objects and collections, as well as general inventory of home furnishings, for insurance purposes.
  
   The pictures are very sharp and clear, but I recommend using an imaging program other than the one supplied with the camera for doing something more than &quot;tweaking&quot; or re-sizing .Adobe, Microsoft, and a host of other software makers have good imaging applications. My personal choice is Micrografx Picture Publisher 8.
    
 The camera's fundamental drawback is the lack of higher resolution required to make decent prints. If you can be satisfied with prints measuring no more than 4x5 inches, you can be satisfied with the FD73.    For web use, I have not seen a camera more suitable.
    
 Once you've learned to accurately frame your picture within the camera, it is a simple task to put the disk in your &quot;A&quot; drive, send it to your web (or image hosting) site, and re-name it there.
    
 Other photographers who contribute to Photo chat rooms (such as eBay's) seem to recommend it highly, too. Their general opinion is that the word &quot;EBAY&quot; should be inscribed on the camera body<br><br>
