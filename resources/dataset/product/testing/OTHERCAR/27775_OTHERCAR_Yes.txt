            Pros:

Small, stylish, very good picture quality. Thought I could get away with one digital camera/camcorder, until I saw the still pictures my Panasonic took. They were nice and small for sending by email. But this also meant they were of low quality. I started looking for a 2-3 mega pixel digital camera. I wanted one with a higher amount of zoom, but I was put off by the very high prices. I decided to get the Canon S-100 thinking that if I was to get a larger, fully featured digital in the future I would probably still want to keep this one as it is so convenient to just through in your pocket. Other Pros include:

It shows you the pictures you�ve taken on the LCD very quickly.

Transferring to my Windows 2000 laptop is a snap; just plug in the USB, the �input to� window pops up automatically. Just choose where you would like to download the pictures to and your off and running.

The USB makes loading the pictures very quick, about 10-15 seconds per picture.

You can email pictures directly from the ZoomBrowser picture storage software that comes with the camera.

The photo-stitch functionality is incredible, now nothing is too big to capture in a single photo, you can take many pictures, even 10 or 12 and �stitch� them together into one.

A waterproof (to a depth of 10 feet or so) case is available for underwater shots.

I have not had any problems with battery life, and the charger is small and easy to use.


Cons:

Although the competition does the same, this camera only comes with an 8 meg card. You are almost forced to purchase a 48 or more Meg card to allow a decent number of pictures on the higher quality level to be stored. With the 8 Meg card I could only take about 14 pictures, with the 48 Meg card, around 85, so with both you end up with capacity of about 100 pictures.

The flash sometimes over exposes close up indoor pictures. Not as much of a problem with digital, as you can just take another shot, but upsetting if you�ve tried to catch a special moment.

A camera that costs this much should come with at least a basic case.
