            I have owned 2 Toyota Tercels now, a 92 and a 94. My biggest compliment for this car is the gas. You can fill the tank on Monday and not have to worry about running out before the weekend. Also, this car is very basic. A wonderful starter car for a teen (I got one for my first car) and is very easy to maintain. Watch the oil and brakes. The brake pads go fast on this car.  Also, due to the front wheel drive, the car is great in snow and ice.

The car has lasted incredably. The interior is black, a bummer cause every piece of dust shows. The carpet and faux leather does break down, but the car continues to be quiet and doesnt develop an "old car rattle". Wind noise is minimal. The rear defroster is the best. Love the size of the trunk and glove box! Why cant the interior of the car be relative to these sizes?!  Seats in front are comfy, for up to about 3 hours or so before you get to the point of needing a breather.

The cons...

I have a 3 year old daughter. It sucks putting her in the back of this car. If I want to take friends a long, they understand that they will be squished like sardines in a can. As for those of us blessed enough to sit in the front, it is fine, as long as you can put your seat back. Controls are awesome for the driver, easy to reach and control.  

When it rains, and the window is cracked, the rain drips in on you. Lame. As I mentioned, the interior of mine is black. I think they all might be that way. It sucks to clean. The fake leather seats tear easily, I suggest seat covers while the condition is still good. Those seat belts that stay connected to the door, but dont move when the door is opened choke you sometimes, and are lame when you are trying to let someone in the back of the car without getting out yourself. Just a few little things I have picked up on.

I had to replace the engine due to a major problem with the valves and main seal. It burned oil, usually a quart every 2 days.  This problem was existant but manageable when I purchased the car. I did this work to it about a year and a half ago and have not had any problems since. Anything goes wrong with a Toyota, fix it so the car will last you forever.

PS- My first Tercel (the 92) I was in a car accident in. It was a doozy, however, noone was seriously injured and considering the conditions and what happened, the car made it through amazingly well. I am not sure what this says about the safety, but the only thing I think could have been better in our crash was if the 92 was equipped with an airbag. Fortunatly, Toyota now installs them in all models, including my present 94 Tercel.
