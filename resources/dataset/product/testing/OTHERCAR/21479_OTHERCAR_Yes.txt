            After learning of my pregnancy in August of 1998, I knew I was going to need a 4 door &quot;family&quot; car. But the boring Grandma looking 4 door cars out there just were not Me. Just because I have a child, doesn't mean I still dont want a sporty car. 

So, the quest for a new car started. I looked and looked, read up on cars, researched, and I was pointed in the direction of a Pontiac Grand Prix. I checked one out, and I fell in love.

 This car has style. It's low, wide, and handles on corners like you wouldn't believe. I have had alot of problems getting my sons carseat to fit right in alot of diffrent cars, but it went right in snug in the backseat.

 The car has every feature that you could possibly want. It gets good gas milage, handles great, and the traction control really helps when its slick out. It tells me when my tire pressure is low, when I need windshild fluid, when a light goes out..everything! It looks sweet on the outside, but is realastic inside to be the &quot;family&quot; car.<br><br>
