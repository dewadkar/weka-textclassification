            My family purchased the Plymouth Neon 2000 in October of 1999. This car is really cute and sporty. Even for a family of 4 (almost five) it works. Their is a lot of room. We can even fit 3 car seats in the back. The price was right, and it has the power to fly if you are one of those people who think you need to travel at the speed of light. I find myself having to watch the speed sometimes because it just takes off. 

The great things about the neon seem to come in second when it comes to the problems we are already experiencing.  If I would have written an EPINION on our car 6 months ago I would have told you it was nothing less than the best. I have to disagree with that now. Our car is 6 months young and has been in the shop 3 times. 

We had to take it in one time for the brakes. They say their is nothing wrong, but both my husband and I know it isn't stopping like it should.  We have taken our Neon in to the shop 2 other times since. 

While on the freeway during rush hour, sitting at a dead stop in Florida the car decided to die on me. I starting it up quickly and began driving down the road. About 5 minutes later it starting getting really hot in the car. (of course the windows were up, the air was on) My little girls started crying they were hot. I looked down and the air condition was supposed to be on. It wasn't though, it went out. We had to drive the rest of the 45 minutes home with the windows down. Our car had less than 12,000 miles on it when the air condition went out. 

They still can't figure out why the car stalled that hot day on the freeway and why it has continued to stall a few times after that. Also, the car continues to have brake problems even today.
 
I have to say that before I buy a car next time I will make sure I ask if they offer a loaner car, incase my car has to go in the shop. We have been without a car now 3 times, and I don't plan on that happening again. <br><br>
