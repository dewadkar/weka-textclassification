            The Grand Prix combines luxury and power to make one bad machine.  I mean bad in a good way, of course.  It corners well and handles easily.  The seats are comfortable in the front.  The back is slightly cramped.  There is plenty of trunk space.  The V6 engine gives you heart-wrenching acceleration.  I love being pushed back in my seat when I push the pedal down.  It gets average mileage for a car of its class.  The Grand Prix's width gives it superb control and agility.  It also comes with several safety features such as airbags and anti-lock brakes.  The Grand Prix is front wheel drive, so it can drive in snow unlike other sports cars.  All this comes at a reasonable price.  <br><br>
