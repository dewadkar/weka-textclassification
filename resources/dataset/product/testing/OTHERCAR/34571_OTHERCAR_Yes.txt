            Look at this car and you will just be in awe of its elegance and style.  This just looks like a rich mans car and that is exactly the image that people will get of you when they see you behind the wheel of this beauty.  With standard four wheel drive and an awesome sound system this car just comes equiped.  Women will give you those second looks.  Your coworkers will give you that little bit of extra respect.  You might get a little extra nookie.  Of all the SUV's out there this is the only one, in my opinion, that doesn't look just like the rest.  The only bad thing is that the gas mileage is not too good.  Other than that it has lots of space and is perfect for a family outing.  Make sure you check this one out if you are planning on buying an SUV.<br><br>
