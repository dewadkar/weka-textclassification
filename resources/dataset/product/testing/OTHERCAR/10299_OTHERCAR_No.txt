            I desperately needed a digital camera.  I wanted to sell items on an auction site.  What did I do?  Run to my local mega mart and find the cheapest one I could.  I ended up with a Vivicam-10.

A new camera takes adjusting to no matter what the price.  I have had it for a year, and still haven't figured it out.  Sometimes, the pictures are too dark.  I will retake it with the puny flash, and it will be too bright.  Now it does come with some nice software.  ArcSoft Impression.  I can adjust minor problems with it.  But most of my pictures end up way too dark.

There is no focus or zoom.  Most pictures are fuzzy, and if anyone moves slightly, it is all over.  Try taking a picture of a rambunctious 2 year old!!!  It is just fuzz.  You cannot get any detail of anything up close.  Not good when you are trying to sell detailed items to the highest bidder.

Do I wish I would have invested more in a digital camera?  Yes.  Does this camera serve the purpose I bought it for?  Barely.  If you are waivering, just go for the better model, you won't regret it.
