            My boyfriend and I are leaders of a very busy, five-piece rock band.  We load and unload our van several times a week, under every condition imaginable (and a few you almost wouldn't believe!)  We've logged tens-of-thousands of miles in less than a year, and while our opinion of our Dodge conversion van is mostly favorable, there are several design flaws that lead us to believe the engineers don't use the product they design!

On the positive side, the seats are incredibly comfortable, and easy to sleep in when reclined.  Also on the positive side, the rear bench seat (which folds out into a bed and is quite comfortable) is easy to remove, which if you load a lot of equipment is a godsend.   And as for maintenance, our vehicle, which  we often drive from Boston to Ft. Lauderdale carrying five adults and towing a UHaul trailer full of heavy equipment, runs beautifully.  We've had no roadside problems, and the vehicle has required only basic maintenance. 

As for the negatives....  as a 5'4&quot; woman who sits in the passenger seat, I can tell you that the &quot;adjustable&quot; seat belt is woefully inadequate as a comfortable restraint.  I find myself constantly having to pull the seatbelt loose and tuck it under my arm, otherwise it cuts into my neck.    Also, the legroom on the front seat passenger side is very tight, with very little room for stretching.  Your legs tend to become cramped on long trips.

Another negative is the rear doors.  You would expect the doors of a van to swing open wide enough to allow easy load-in and load-out of equipment.  Unfortunately, this is not the case.  The double doors only open to 90 degree angles, making it difficult to maneuver large items in and out.  (If something is heavy enough to require two people to lift it, you will have difficulty accomplishing this.)  Another thing making loading and unloading difficult is inadequate lighting.  Rear lighting is okay, but if you're unloading from the side at night, it's very difficult to see into the vehicle.

Last but not least, and I admit this is the most niggling little complaint.... the interior handle to the side door is impossible to find in the dark!  It's flush with the door, and in an odd location.  I'd hate to have to get out the side door in an emergency!  

Other than these flaws, we love our van.  For the driver, it's very comfortable and handles well, even when towing.  There's a lot of cargo room.  And the price is great, too.  But the minor discomforts mean that, rather than automatically buying another Dodge next year, we'll look to see if another manufacturer makes a comparable product without the flaws.
