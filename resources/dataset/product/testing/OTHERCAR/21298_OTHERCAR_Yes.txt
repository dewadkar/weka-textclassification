            I bought my 1992 Toyota Camry V6 XLE 3 years ago when I lived in Dallas from a guy who was the original owner.  It had 79,000 and now has 105,000.

I had test-driven dozens of cars at dealerships and when I got into my first Camry I know that was the car I wanted.  Up to that point I had the &quot;buy American&quot; mentality.  Every Toyota owner I talked to said their cars lasted a long long time (one guy was at 285,000 miles!)

I took it with me when I moved back to Cleveland and was pleased to find that it handled snowy and icy conditions very well.  In fact, of all the cars I have ever owned it has proven to be the BEST on slippery roads.

It still rides smooth and tight and I can't recall paying for any significant repairs since I've owned it.  Maintenance is easy and inexpensive.  Most people who see the car for the first time think it's a new car, even though it is 8 years old!!!  

I believe that I will use that car for at least another 100,000 miles, if not more.  

I highly recommended buying one even with high mileage provided the previous owner took care of it.  <br><br>
