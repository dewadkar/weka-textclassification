            I purchased a Hyundai Sonata as a graduation gift for my daughter. Not only did a I get a fully loaded car for a very low price, I also got a smooth driving vehicle that both looks and handles like a dream.
I found that by negotiating in a meaningful manner, I was able to get what I wanted with very little haggling.  The dealer, still working hard for new customers, threw in at my request, a trunk mounted 4 CD player and turntable.  The price I paid for the whole package, including all taxes and registration was less than $15,000.I am now considering their new SUV for my wife.  I haven't decided yet but if I do get a SUV, I will definitely try the Hyundai based on the satisfaction I have with the Sonata.
The 100,000 mile guarantee is a lot of "Peace of mind" as well.
