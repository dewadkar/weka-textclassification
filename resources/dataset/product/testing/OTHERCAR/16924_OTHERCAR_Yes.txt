            This past May we started looking for a new car that would contain our growing family and all the gear associated with such an expansion.

We looked at the VW Passat Wagon, the Saturn S wagon (not the new L as it was not available then) the Volvo Wagon, the Honda CR-V and the Toyota RAV models.  Our requirements were:

1. Passenger space: Room for 2 kids now and 3 later; it has to have enough room for three car seats in the back seat while still allowing the doors to close.

2. Cargo space: Room for all our camping gear.  We do a lot of car camping and we needed enough space to hold all the stuff we need to bring along. The 69.x feet of cargo space was much larger than the small SUVs.  We can get an incredible of stuff back there; a week-long camping excursion was easily contained.  The roof rack also comes in handy for that extra bit, and it isn't too high to access.

3. Gas mileage.  It has to get over 20 mpg in the city and 30 on the highway.  The goal in life is not to burn as much fossil fuel as we can before we die (take note ye Ford Excursion owners.)  

4. Safe.  The car has all the standard stuff, including air bags, anti-lock brakes, side impact beams etc, plus it has a very cool AWD system that keeps the car on the road and under control in adverse conditions.  Also, the car handles incredibly well, due to both the AWD system and the boxter engine that lowers the car�s center of gravity (unlike the roll-prone SUVs we were looking at).  

5. Affordable.  Anything over $25 grand was just out of the picture for us.  Sure we would love a Volvo Cross-Country, but that was quite a bit more than we were able to swing a month.  That and it is kinda a yuppie car &lt;grin&gt;.  The L 30th Anniversary came with a bunch of extras I would have had to pay for on the others.  It came with a moon roof (which I would never pay for, but I just love it now), sporty aluminum wheels (again, would never pay for, but they look great), AC, and power locks/doors.

We have now had the car for 5 months and it has been an incredible car thus far.  The car�s gas mileage isn�t quite up to the claims for the first few months, but as the engine has broken in, it has gotten better.  We got up to 26 mpg on the highway fully loaded on the aforementioned camping trip (and I was going 80+ mph for much of it).

We have had only one small problem with the driver side power window control.  A day after bringing it home, it snapped off inside and was very loose.  I took it in and the dealer fixed it in 15 minutes without question.  

Note that I didn�t mention power as one of my criteria.  Our old car was a Geo Metro, so anything was a vast improvement over the 1.0 L 2 cylinder engine in that rolling egg.  The boxter engine is louder than some would like, and several car reviews have mentioned this as a negative, but for me I like the low throaty rumble of the car as I drive.  The 2.2L engine is more than enough for my needs.  Those that are planning on towing large, ugly RV�s might opt for the larger engine (now the only engine for the 2k models).

The 2k Legacy models were just released about a month ago.  While they made some improvements to the interior of the car (i.e. a cup holder that blocks the stereo), I really prefer the look of the older models exterior.  

Here is why we didn't buy any of the others:

1. Passat:  This is a beautiful car and Consumer Reports rates this a best buy.  However it was too expensive because they are trying to appeal to the image conscious shopper.  Yes the design is beautiful,but I don�t pose next to the car, I drive it.  It didn�t come with AWD either, which we love even more now than when we bought it. We also didn�t trust VW much in the quality area.  This is a new model and could have some bugs to work out.  I�d prefer the reliable Legacy which was a well established model with a great track record.

2. Saturn: too small, and they really nickel and dime you with the options that are standard on the other.  I�d give the L a look though, now that it is out as it is bigger and more targeted at what we were looking for.

3. Volvo: This car is safe and has the third seat option, which would both be nice, but I really would have a hard time spending the extra 10-20 grand on the name and yuppie appeal.

4. The CR-V was a nice car, but it had less cargo room and was more prone to roll.  I�ve seen a lot of negative articles on these mini-SUV models and rollover lately too, so that did it, despite the fact that Honda makes a great car and they put a picnic table in the back. ( I like gadgets).

5. RAV: Same as the CR-V.  That and I don�t like the appearance of the creature very much.<br><br>
