            I bought my 1995 Mazda 626 LX used in the summer of 1998. I had recently joined the military and was looking for something reliable in hopes of seeing many sights during my assignments to various places. I bought the car with 46,000 miles on it and have since added another 40,000 miles. I have had absolutly no problems with the vehicle, I do only minimal maintenance on it. Oil changes, air filter, etc... 

As for performance, the sporty V-6 offers plenty of power and whisper quiet performance. I have been through the mountains of Washington, Idaho, up to Canada, and all over the US. The engine never had a problem finding the power required to make it up a snow covered mountain road or just to pass someone when you had to do it spur of the moment. I must say though, the brakes with the semi-metallic brake pads do opt for a bit of &quot;squealing&quot; from time to time and the highway noise does get a bit much sometimes. As for other quirks...the power antenna gave out on me not to long after I got the car. I have seen many of the same year model 626's and the problem seems to be with all of them. I simply unplugged the antenna's power supply instead of paying the $250 the dealer was so anxious to charge.

Overall, I believe this has been one of the best cars I have ever owned and can only hope that I have the kind of performance from my next vehicle when I tear myself away from this one. I would recommend this car to everyone! It appeals to the family man for room and reliability, but can also appeal to the kid in everyone who drives it for its sportyness! <br><br>
