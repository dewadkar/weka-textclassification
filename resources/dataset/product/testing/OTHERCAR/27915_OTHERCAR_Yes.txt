            Want to take a ride in the most smooth driving car.  Well then invest in the lexus ls400.  I have a 98 Lexus LS400 and it is the best investment I have made on a car in a long time.  The car feels like you are driving on air.  It is very roomy and the pick up is exceptional.  If you floor it too hard you get whip lash.  I have the navigational system in mine and that is so much fun and very helpful.  When you go on road trips and want to make sure that you will not get lost, just turn on the navigation and it will talk to you the whole way there, telling you where to turn and what roads to go on.  You can control the climate and music and so much more from this.  I think that every car should come with this helpful attire.  The Lexus is a great car, especially if you are going on a trip.  First of all the gas mileage is great.  Secondly the seats are so comfortable that it makes the trip seem so much shorter than it really is.  Your rear end never starts to hurt. Actually they are so comfortable that you could go to sleep and sleep until you get to where you are going.  The stereo system that it comes with is great also.  The sound quality is awesome.  I would recommend this Lexus Ls400 to everyone.  It is truly the best car.<br><br>
