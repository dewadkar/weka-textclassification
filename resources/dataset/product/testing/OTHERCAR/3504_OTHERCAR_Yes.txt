            I currently own a Mercedes Station Wagon E280 4-Matic. Of all the cars I have driven and bought over the years, this has to be the most versatile. Never have I been able to use my car to do so many different things. From do the shopping, to moving house.

My reason for purchasing this car was due to my ever increasing family size. This car is able to cope with a five member family, even though you can add a further two seats in the trunk, I do not advise it for safety's sake. The idea of letting someone sit, with no legroom and on top of the gas tank is somewhat of a turn off.

I have driven this car on many terrains, and was the most surprised to see how it performed on icy mountain roads. Never have I felt so safe. One can't forget that it follows Mercedes standards in quiet and smooth ride.

With the recent developments in technology Mercedes has also reduced the fuel consumption, which is something largely overdue.

The only draw back on this car is that for the price you pay, you would at least expect that some extras bee thrown in on the deal.

This car should only be for people with four to five family members, with young children, otherwise I advise the sedan.<br><br>
