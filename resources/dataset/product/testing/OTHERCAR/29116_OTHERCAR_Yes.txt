            I traded a 1999 2wd Super Cab Ranger with 14K for this Tacoma X-tra Cab P-up with 4wd. It has 120K. It also was my neighbors.
First Impression:
I have stared over the Yew bushes scince Don (my neighbor) bought this truck. I liked it when he first go it. It had the style it needed for a truck. Plus it has the optional Chrome package, which adds for it's charm. The interior said truck. The plastic bits are durable. I like the automatic shifter on the floor. Toyota can't seem to make a decent column shifter, so this was a good choice for the Tacoma. The 4wd system isn't as handy to use as Fords Ranger or Chevrolets S-10 Pickup. 
Drive train:
The 3.4 V-6 has plenty of power and good mid-range power. It handles like a truck. It's not as nimble as a ranger, nor does it corner as well, but not as bad as an S-10 or a Frontier. It rides well, better than Pre-Runner model Tacoma. Though it has more bounce than a Dakota or an S-10. The 4-speed automatic shifts smoothly and doesn't hunt for gears. This truck won't tow much. You will have to step up to a Dakota for V-8 power. Or Ranger or S-10 if a V-6 fits the bill
Interior:
The interior is truck. There isn't an over abundance of Plastic to break and get scratched. The doors could be a bit thicker but that's my preference. The seats could use lumbar support and could be a little bigger. There is a useless middle seat, which has a nice fold down arm-rest. The rear jump seats are kid sized (or small adult). They also can hold a Car seat. Unusual for this kind of tuck. The radio has tiny buttons and I wish the steering wheel had more spokes. But I do like where the cruise control button is. 
Durability:
From what Don told me and what receipts I have, nothing major except a water pump have been replaced on this truck. It has 120K. It also has had most oil changes @5500 miles and all the other maintenance stuff done to keep it in good health.
Overall:
I paid squat for mine. I was traded the ranger for a windstar that I did not like by carmax, so I have made out well. This truck is more or less a 4th car at our house and will be driven some, but not daily.
