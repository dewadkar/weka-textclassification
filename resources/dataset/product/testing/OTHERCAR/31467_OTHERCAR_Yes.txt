            This is the first and only digital camera that i have personally owned and i was quite impressed.

I was originally thinking of getting the HP Photosmart 215 because it was much cheaper until i actually saw the two side by side. The Photosmart 318 is better in every way over the Photosmart 215. It looks better, MUCH smaller, lighter, has a much faster refresh rate, and has higher picture quality. The one thing that the Photosmart 215 has that the Photosmart 318 doesn't is macro mode, however, the macro on the Photosmart 215 isn't very helpful anyways.

Even tho the Photosmart 318 has a 2x digital zoom, it is still only digital so the quality is not that good. However, i have not needed to use any zoom yet so it hasn't been a problem. There are also accessories that you may buy separately that will allow you to add lenses and filters to increase your image qualities.

The Photosmart 318 has 3 different image quality settings.
High - 1792x1200
Medium - 1792x1200
Low - 592x400
The difference between the high quality and medium quality settings is just the compression. The medium quality pictures are compressed to about half the size causing it to lose some quality (but not alot).

It is also very easy to use. Hp is known for their very easy to use products and this camera is no exception. The menus and buttons are self explanitory and the software is fool proof.

I highly recomend it and think it is a great camera, however, it could use a macro mode for close up pictures and an optical zoom for distance pictures.
