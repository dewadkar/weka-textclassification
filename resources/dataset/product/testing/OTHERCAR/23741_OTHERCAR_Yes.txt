            I can remember walking home from middle school and a jetta driving past me... from that moment on...i knew that was the car for me....well, 13years later...my dream became a reality.....and i could not be more pleased with my choice....I've heard that a jetta is consider a &quot;male&quot; car...well, I guess that stereotype is the exception...not the rule....she handles beautifully..in fact my 1998 Jetta GLS handles just the same or even better than my grandmothers 1999 caddy!....the exterior is lovely and the interior is so comfortable...I hate driving long distances..but because i can adjust my setting to an range..from back and forth to up and down (the buttock area, as well as, the back area)I do not mine riding long distance...but even though my Susie has yet to disappointment me in any major way..there are a few things that I have to shake my head at...it handles poorly in the snow...in fact I choice not to ride my car when there is snow on the ground....and its not the best with gas...in fact my 1995 Toyota Tercel...was far more superior in both of these areas....yet, I still would recommend this car to my friends...both men and women!<br><br>
