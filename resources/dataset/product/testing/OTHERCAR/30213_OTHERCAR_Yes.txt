            This truck is the first vehicle that I ever owned.  I bought it used in '93 with about 25,000 miles on it, and have been driving it since.  I use it as a second vehicle now, since it is always handy to have a truck.  There are not too many frills with this truck, but then again it does what I needed it to.  I have the 4 cylinder model without air conditioning or power steering.  It has really no options as tested by me, but is still reliable.  The truck is mechanically very sound.  The only thing I have replaced on the truck so far has been tires and various lights.  Pretty much what you might consider to be routine maintenance.  This truck rides pretty good, but probably is not the best choice for longer trips.  The bottom line is, If you need a vehicle for trips under 50 miles, and don't need comfort features this is a great vehicle.  This truck is perfect for having around when you need to move something.<br><br>
