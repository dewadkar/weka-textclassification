            My wife and I bought this vehicle because we wanted something larger than our '99 Civic for our future family.

A small SUV seemed to be exactly what we were looking for.
V6 power and off road capabilities were not an issue for us so we looked at the following three vehicles - Toyota RAV4, Subaru Forester and Honda CR-V.
All three looked great but the CR-V stood out for two main reasons 1. is a Honda - which we have always had great experiences with. 2. it offered the most space without sacrificing gas mileage.

After driving the vehicle for just over 5,000 miles (no winter driving yet) I can say the following:

Likes:
- Comfortable ride
- Nice, high driving position
- Plenty of room - the fold and tumble seats are very handy
- Styling - I know many feel it is boring to look at but I like the appearance
- Mileage is good for an SUV 22/26. It is similar to many midsize cars
- Quiet engine
- Fold down traytable between front seats
- Reclining backseats
- plenty of storage compartments
- Reasonable price

Dislikes
- Small gas tank. Even with good mileage it seems like it needs to be filled up frequently. 
- A muffled rattle that seems to be coming from the drivers side door (only happens in town when the window is up). I would think that this is just our particular car, not a fault for all CR-Vs though.
- Radio and heating/ac controls are a bit of a stretch for the driver to reach.
- Middle rear headrest creates a large blindspot (this is easily remedied by removing the headrest)
- Small cupholders. I usually have a 32 oz. Nalgene bottle of water that I use while driving that does not fit in any of the cupholders.
- Wind noise. We have a kayak rack on top which is the main cause of this noise but I have heard from other owners that wind noise is a little higher than average even without a rack.
- Has been recalled for a problem with the gear shift (it could look like it was in park but actually not be). This is something I don't expect of a Honda.

If I had to buy again I would most likely still buy the CR-V although I would take a closer look at the Subaru Forester. The Forester has a little less room, but a better AWD system and probably a more car like ride.
