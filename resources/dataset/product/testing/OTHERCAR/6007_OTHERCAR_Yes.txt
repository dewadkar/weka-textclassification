            fine fine fine, the car in the picture, yes the yellow one, that's my car, a 1997 Monoco Yellow Turbo SE 900 convertible. You've by now read all about the excellent reviews about its comfort, its large back seat, its wonderful acceleration, the very cool automatic folding top, and interior detail. A very nice car indeed, but what makes this car special is its quirkiness.

* in center console ignition - if you haven't driven a saab, it takes a while to find it - am told its actually a theft protection scheme

* gear shift reverse ring - drives friends and vallets crazy

* waffle grate vents - who designed these things anyway and what were they thinking?

* the yellow - i've been hailed for rides (taxi) and actually had a busy, not too detailed oriented business person try to get in my car. (it's actually a beautiful color; classic lotus. Reminds me of a Walkman)

If you haven't figured it out already, I love the thing. For all the normal reasons but mostly for its quirks.
