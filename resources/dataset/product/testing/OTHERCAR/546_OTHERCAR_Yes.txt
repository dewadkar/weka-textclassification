            There are several things you must know about my new 2000 Hyundai Accent. First: it's silver. Good color. Second: it's clean. I mean, clean! Inside and out. This is a truly unprecedented event in my car-owning life. Third: it was cheap, it's warantied up the wazoo (60,000 miles, bumper to bumper). Best part: I bought it in an hour!
I said to my husband, after buying it (an emergency car purchase, as my 1994 Hyundai Excel died, without warning, and I couldn't face either fixing it or cleaning it), &quot;Do you think my new Accent looks beter than my last car because it's clean?&quot; He said, no, it looked better because my Excel was extremely ugly.
Not the Accent. Great gas mileage, and it's been mistaken for a Volkswagon Passat (all the flash, probably about $8,000 cheaper) at least twice. What more could you ask for?
I consider my new Accent a real turning point in my car-owning history. Cute, but not ostentatious. A little more pricey than car purchases past, but not so over the deep end that I can't afford to eat (and the waranties really make it a bargain). Zippy, compact (so I'm not hurting the environment). Did I mention how clean it is?<br><br>
