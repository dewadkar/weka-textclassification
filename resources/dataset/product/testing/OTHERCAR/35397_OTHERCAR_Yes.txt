            How can one measure greatness.  A BMW 3 series would make any man or woman happy.  With the luxury that any doctor could appreciate or any CEO's ego can hold.  The power that can out perform any Corvette or Porsche on the market, how could one now want the feeling given just by driving a BMW.  I can personally say that my BMW completes my life.  This car is everything you could want whether you are a Lawyer, Pilot, everyday bussiness man, or even a teenager.  They also have very high safety standards and are built with the latest German technology.  You get everything in a race car in a BMW, and if you're a teenager, a great sound system that is easy to build onto.  A car that knows its number one but wont attract attention from the costly state patrol.  While still having that glamor, sporty, and mean look you can be assured that you are a high class person when you own your very own BMW.  This car will make you feel and act like a richer person, and everybody you know will have a new found respect for you.  If you're a teen the attention you get just by cruising in this car will be enough to fulfill your high school career, and it is always a plus knowing that you will never be beat.  This car will outperform any stock sports car whether you have an 80s style shell or a brand new 2001 3 series.You will feel like you are in your 20s all over again, and, with owning a BMW 3 series, you can act like it too.
