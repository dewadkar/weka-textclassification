               <b>P</b>aying its respects to the great letter cars of the 1950s and 1960s, the current 300M has semi dramatic styling (very dramatic for 1998 upon its introduction), a relatively powerful V6, and some of the best road manners of any American sport sedan that was on sale for 1999.


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>

      A light and airy cabin greets you upon entry. The leather upholstered seats are soft, but not overly so. Although the V6 may not have the authoritative husky sound of a classic V8, it does give the 300M rapid acceleration. Its 4-speed 'autostick' semi automatic transmission and power steering make the 300M a real world sports sedan that anyone can live with. Turn-in is excellent, and a very stiff chassis mean that its cornering limits are hard to reach. I really like this particular engine for this car.  The commercials may make the 300M seem like race car, however the 300M's ride offers more of a smooth character than anything else.

   While the smaller LH series sedans have either a 2.7 or 3.2 liter V6 for 1999, the 300M, the flagship of the range had to go one better. Sitting between the fenders is the same 3.5 liter DOHC V6 engine that is found in the 1999 Plymouth Prowler. It boasts a state-of-the-art specification with cast alloy block and heads, four valves per cylinder activated by single over head camshafts per bank. It relies on a distributorless ignition, and a coil for each cylinder. I still feel that the 300M would have been better off with a 300HP powered small displacment V8. 

     Although the 300M shares its basic powertrain with the LHS, the 300M is tuned to deliver more sporty driving. It has a recalibrated <b>suspension</b> with stiff springs, anti roll bars, and revised shock valving for increased cornering prowess and reduced body roll. The LHS comes with a fully automatic 4-speed automatic, the 300M has Chrylser's Autostick which allows manual cluthless shifting. This transmission is simple to use, and is much easier than the J-gate from Jaguar.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>
  

The <b>interior</b> of the 300M is very sporty, supportive bucket seats, and the black-on-white instruments have a very classic look. There is  tons of room everywhere. A short trunk although was directed by European dimensions. With safety now a primary aspect in the automotive industry, the 300M comes with dual front and side airbags, seat belt pretensioners, anti lock brakes and traction control. One thing I noticed was that the plastics throughout the cabin are all of quality and fitted well (no lose flimsy pieces). Unlike cars like the Ford Taurus SHO, the 300M's interior actually feels like a luxury car.


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i> 

     <b>Exterior:</b> The 300M has very cab forward styling, when the original LH sedan was introduced in 1993, it set a new standard for interior space and outward visibility thanks to the 'cab forward' look. This design also pushes the wheel out to the corners, helping to improve handling and stability. All in all the 300M is a decent looking car, now 4 years after its introduction the style is no longer a head turner, but it still remains modern.


<i>Pricing:</i>

  The <b>price</b> is right for this car when new, and even used. Around $21,000 for a used 1999, and around $29,000 when it was new.. This was less than the Taurus SHO, the Taurus SHO was a little faster, but could not match the other performance aspects of the 300M, such as handling, not to mention the 300M's design, interior,and resale value.

   There has been very few complaints about the 300Ms <b>reliability</b>, It's been a solid car since the proverbial 'get go'for mostly all its owners (according to conversations with over 10 owners).
