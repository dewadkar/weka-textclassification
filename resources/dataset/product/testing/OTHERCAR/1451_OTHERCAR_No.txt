            When my parents began looking for a car last fall, they had a general idea what they wanted.  They were looking for a compact car with good gas mileage, good pickup, and good reliability.  With these criteria in mind, we began looking at Hondas.  They have always had good gas mileage and are at the pinnacle of automobile reliability, so it seemed like a good idea.  So we went to a used car dealer and drove Civics, Accords, and Preludes, with none of them giving us the feeling we were looking for.  Little did we know how much we would love that dark green Saturn in the corner. 

We test drove it on a whim, and fell in love with it immediately.  The car was completely loaded, with options such as the keyless entry feature, power everything, and a 5-speed manual gearbox.  The shifts are absolutely effortless, as the shifter glides through the gates cleanly.  The pickup on the car surprised me greatly, as I never knew the DOHC engine had such a punch to it.  Even with the redline at a norm of 6500rpm's, it seems to take a while to get there, meaning that you can really rip it in the first couple gears.  

Braking power is exceptional, and I have yet to panic due to a mushy pedal, brake fade, or lockup.  The suspension is also better than I expected, although the stock tires could use a little more grip.  But that problem is easily solved with a set of new rubber.  

I feel that this car is a good car for an enthusiast with a family.  It has enough punch to let you rip it up when you feel the need, yet still makes a fine family sedan.  Trunk room is average, not too small, not too big.  Rear passenger room is also not a problem, even for adults.

Another person who would benefit from this car is the person learning to drive a manual transmission.  My sister learned her way around the 5-speed in less than a week, thanks to the easiest shifting tranny I've ever driven.  When I drive the Saturn, I actually have a harder time in my car (a Honda CRX) when I switch cars back. 

A couple things I don't really like about the Saturn are the looks.  I've never been a huge fan of Saturn bodies, and this one is no exception.  I'm willing to overlook it because of the ride quality, but I think Saturn needs to go back to the drawing board with their cars.  They're really pretty ugly.

Another negative feature are the blinker switch, located on the steering column.  One thing I noticed is that the blinkers are really hard to turn on and off, making them a pain to use when switching lanes on the highway.  They take a considerable amount of force to "click", and could have been made slightly better.  But again, not really a big deal. 

The third and final downfall of the Saturn is its stability problems at high speed.  Of course I took it upon myself to take the car on its first trip over the century mark in terms of MPH, and I was not pleased with what I saw.  Around 95 mph, the car begins shaking quite bad, and I wasn't comfortable going much higher.  Having driven 130 in my CRX, the problem was not in me, but with my inexperience with the car.  Although this is somewhat of a big problem, about 99% of owners will not ever try that or care.

So all in all I love my parents' car.  It has the right mixture of practicality and performance, and would suit just about anyone.  Look for an update of this review sometime this summer, as I plan on autocrossing our Saturn (see what autocrossing is at http://www.importspeed.net/hondapages).  This will surely test the limits of acceleration, handling, and braking.

*****UPDATE*****

OK, I know I promised an update over the summer.  Well, the truth is that I never even got to autocross this car.  A couple months after this epinion was written, the car began to get a bad vibration at any speed.  Even cruising in second gear in traffic vibrated the entire cabin.  Highway speeds?  You'd think there was an airplane propeller on your hood.  Basically, I didn't feel safe autocrossing it, so I never did.  Many trips to the dealer and mechanic yeilded no solutions.

The next thing to go was the engine.  With about 85,000 miles on the clock, it started making all sorts of monster noises.  First a knock, then a rattle, then, on the way home from my college, a BANG - and it was done.  I coasted to the side of the highway, and the engine was gone.  Unfortunately, my parents still owed about 75% of the car's value to the bank.  They couldn't sell it when it wasn't running, so they had no choice but to take out another loan for a new (well, rebuilt) engine.  

Today the car runs great.  The vibration is basically gone, and the new engine is a champ.  Unfortunately, my parents are going to pay over $11,000 for this car, when they originially bought it for $7,000.  While I don't doubt the reliability of this new engine, if we had to do it again, I would have trusted my gut instinct and gone with another Honda.  You shouldn't have to replace an engine with that low a mileage.  

So basically my opinion has changed for the worse.  If you buy a Saturn, good luck - you'll need it.
