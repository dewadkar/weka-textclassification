            <p>After owning a Fujifilm MX-1200 digital camera for over a year I decided it was time to upgrade. It was a hard decision on which camera to get. It was between a Sony Cybershot DSC-P50, Kodak DX-3600, Nikon 775 or Canon A20.  Although all the cameras offer very similar feature sets and prices I went for the Sony mostly because I like the way it looks and functions. I have used the P-50 for a few months and have found it to be an excellent camera.</p>

<p>Power</p>
</b>
<p>If purchasing this camera be forewarned that it becomes immediately necessary to purchase rechargeable batteries as alkaline batteries will only last long enough to take around 10 pictures and should only be used if absolutely
necessary. Although expensive, I recommend purchasing Sony's Accessory Kit(retail $100.00) which includes a Lithium Ion Rechargeable Battery, Battery Charger/AC Adapter and camera carrying case. When using Sony's battery you will have an on screen display that tells you about how many minutes of use is left on battery. With a full charge using the flash you should get around 80 minutes of use when taking pictures or well over 100 minutes in playback mode. If you are not willing to pay the high price for Sony's propriety battery a set of AA
Nickel Metal Hydride rechargeable batteries will work just as well with a much smaller price tag.</p>

<p>LCD</p>
</b>
<p>Although the LCD measures only 1.5" it is very sharp and easy to read. It does feature a non-glare coating
which helps some when viewing outside. You will find it is somewhat difficult to clean fingerprints/smudges off the non-glare surface.  If necessary you can change the brightness of the LCD and LCD backlight in the setup menu which will sometimes help for viewing outside.</p>

<p>Interface & Operation</p>
</b>
<p>The menus are generally quick and easy to navigate. When you press the menu button a graphical overlay shows along the bottom of the screen. The menus are easily navigated with a 4 way rocker button. When in playback mode you have the ability to zoom in on a picture by up to 5x a great feature to ensure that your picture was well focused. Another convenient feature I have found in the playback mode when viewing thumbnails is the ability to select multiple pictures to be deleted rather than just one or all at a time that most cameras offer. The camera also has some minor built in editing capabilities such as being able to crop, resize or rotate a picture.</p>
<b>
<p>Picture Quality</p>
</b>
<p>I have taken hundreds of pictures since purchasing this camera. This includes pictures of anything from close-up macros of flowers to pictures of vintage pottery, porcelain and crystal for online auctions. I have ordered prints of pictures I have taken with this camera through Sony's imagestation.com and I must say it is hard to tell they are not traditional photos. Nearly all pictures taken have turned out bright, sharp and well saturated.

<p>Image Download</p>
</b>
<p>Downloading pictures to the PC is a snap. Especially if using Windows XP or OS 10 as you can set the camera to PTP ( Picture Transfer Protocol). I personally use Windows XP and as soon as I plug the camera into the USB port with the camera set to PTP the computers detects that I have plugged in a Sony Cyber-shot Digital Camera and automatically transfers the pictures to the My Pictures folder on my computer's hard drive all without having to install any drivers. If set in USB mode the camera will be recognized as a Memory Stick device with no need to install extra drivers.</p>
<p>If using Windows 98/98SE/ME it is necessary to install the drivers included
on Sony's before being able to download the images to your computer.</p>

<p>Optional Accessories</p>
</b>
<p>Sony has a whole arsenal of optional accessories including several Memory Stick Readers, wide angle & telephoto lenses, filters, tripods, cases, lithium batteries, chargers and thermal printers.</p>
