            My Cavalier (coupe) has been a very reliable car.  I bought this car used (with 17,000 miles) in 1993 so it was basically new.  I now have almost 130,000 miles on it and it's still great.  They engine, however, only has 75,000 miles on it because it had to be replaced after I got caught in a flood (not the car's fault - acts of God are hard to control).  
It has a lot of power for a 4 cylinder, but I have a manual transmission.  I have driven automatics of the same year that don't have as much power.  The A/C also drains the power when it's on, but not too much.  I have taken this car all over the US: to and from college three times a year (1,000 miles each way), to Moab, UT with my bike each year, on vacations and trips everywhere and to and from work every day.  I have so many great memories with my car that I hate to think of when I'll have to get rid of her (No, I didn't name the car).  
My THULE bike/ski rack fits on it great, too.  The car is now almost 10 years old and with age and use the interior things (vents, door locks/handles) are starting to break, but if you knew what my car has been through you would be amazed that they have taken this long to break.  This has been a wonderful car for my needs and I definitely recommend it.  It has a big trunk, too.  
Of course, before you go out buying a car that someone you've never met recommends, you should ALWAYS have a mechanic check it out first.  But you knew that, right?  I knew you did. 

UPDATE (4/19/02):  Still going strong.  Now almost 150,000 miles.
