            In 1996 I purchased this vehicle not having previously owned a Subaru.  I must say that i have really put this vehicle through its paces.  I ski, mountain bike and take road trips regularly.  This vehicle has never broken down once, or given me any kind of trouble. It has plenty of acceleration and the brakes and suspension are great as well.  The handling is the tightest of any of the vehicle i have driven in it's price range.  I can't say enough about this vehicle.  The reliability is one of the best things about it for me.  If you have teenage drivers in the family then this car is for you.  It has dual airbags, crumple zones, side impact beams, and most importantly the All wheel drive system, which really does work quite well. If you want fun, power, safety, and accessibility to the outdoors, then this is your car.<br><br>
