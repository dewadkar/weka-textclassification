            	I bought this great car because it was small, comfortable and easy to drive.  I love they way it coasts down the road.  When you go over a bump you don't relize it because the ride is so smooth and the tires so shock absorbent that when driving the car, it's like your on cloud nine.  

	
	A Celica is a great car and is good for driving family, friends and and even your pets.  My dog loves to get in the back seat and stick his head over the armrest to see whats going on in the front of the car.  When I drive my kids to school they like to pretend that they are the driver and they are manuvering the car around obstacles in a track.
	

	The car is really space efficient and you never have trouble getting into a parking space.  In this car is seems like you are an ant in a race for the food.  If you are a person who doesn't like small cars then you shouldn't get this car.  I like the felling of being close to the ground and being able to have full control of the car.  <br><br>
