            We bought our '96 LX used w/24K miles in 1998 from a reputable dealer.  It is a great vehicle for hauling 4 kids around town and is also comfortable on long drives.  Odyssey is easy to maneuver anywhere and gets very good gas mileage for a minivan.  As with all Hondas that I have owned, the Odyssey is fun to drive and very RELIABLE. The only $ spent on this vehicle has been for new tires and routine maintenance.  Our two complaints are: the engine is sluggish/loud when carrying a full load; and access to the 3rd seat requires folding down a portion of the middle bench, which can be a pain.  Recently, a loud squeak developed in the rear suspension.  After spending $330 for new rear shocks, the squeak returned within 2 days.  The dealer made efforts to fix this, at no charge, however, we are stumped.  Has anyone out there experienced this type of problem?  We have not overloaded the vehicle and maintain it well.  Any and all reasonable suggestions are appreciated!  Thanks, Pops3@aol.com<br><br>
