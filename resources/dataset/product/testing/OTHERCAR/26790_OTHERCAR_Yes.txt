            I really wanted to buy this vehicle. Really.
I was intrigued by the styling of the Vue when I first saw one this spring, so when my wife and I decided that hauling a 2-year old around in a 4X4 Tacoma wasn't cutting it anymore, we started our new vehicle search at the Saturn dealer. 
Everything you've heard about the Saturn experience is true. They were very laid back, knew the product and gave absolutely no pressure. We test drove a V6 AWD Vue and found many things to like.
The cargo area was as large or larger than other vehicles in it's class, the "greenhouse" felt very large and the view unobstructed. We placed our son in his child seat in the middle of the rear seat and the position was perfect. We could turn around and see him without pulling a muscle (as happens with our Maxima) yet his head did not obstruct the view in the rear view mirror. The V6 had plenty of low-end torque and had power through a wide rpm band, although it got very loud when pushed (moreso even than my Tacoma which is a true truck).The controls were fine (although I've never obsessed about that myself) and the materials seemed adequate. The passenger's seat back had a plastic cover to protect it when laid flat in case you need to throw in a couple of 2x4's.
We were ready to buy yet a little voice in my head kept nagging at me. Was I really in love with the Vue enough to live with it for the next 5-7 years?
During the test drive, I noticed that I constantly had to make small corrections to the steering to keep it straight. This was most prevalent at slower speeds and I assume it was attributable to the new electronic power steering. (The sales rep claimed no other customer had mentioned it before, so maybe I'm overly sensitive!?). While the ride was good, the feel of the steering was quite soft and there seemed to be a lot of play in the steering, kind of like my old '77 Ford Granada from my high school days!(Okay, a bit of an exageration, but it was much looser than anything else I have driven in recent years). 
Also, the day we took the Vue out was particularly hot (around 90 with typical Indiana 90 percent humidity!). We were out on the road for about a half an hour and the Vue's cabin never cooled down sufficiently. Our '97 Maxima was just fine on the same day, so I don't think it was just the weather. We confirmed with the sales rep that the AC had been charged up prior to delivery and she said it had. But maybe once again I was just too sensitive.
I guess the thing that really kept us from buying the Vue was the overall sense that the quality was not there. When you close the door on just about any Import vehicle, there is a solid "whump". The steering is rock solid, the controls feel solid, the materials are high quality and you just have an overall sense that the engineers had some say in the final product, not just the designers. 
We ended up buying a Toyota Highlander (a 4-cylinder no less...it truly drives like a V6, but more on that elsewhere). I feel very comfortable we made the right choice.
If you absolutely will not purchase an import, then the Vue is probably a solid choice. I guess that my opinion is that, given the amount of money new cars cost these days, I want a little better than "adequate" or "solid".
