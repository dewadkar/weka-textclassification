            I bought this car because I loved the way it felt when I sat in it. It was a retirement present to me.  I have driven over 6,000 miles since the end of June when I bought it.  It drives like a dream, is sturdy, handles better than my Passat did.  There is plenty of room for four adults and a baby in a baby seat.  The trunk is large enough to handle about ten bags of groceries.  If you need more room, the back seats will fold down, fold up against the front seats, or you can take them completely out and use the rollers and handles to move them.

I have a 5 speed transmission and have plenty of power.  I have heard that the automatic is a little sluggish but I haven't actually driven one. It drives like a dream on freeways or on curvy highways.  It turns around easily. It's easy at the gas station.  I am averaging between 26-30 miles to the gallon. 

Anyone who likes to drive should by this car.  However if you are looking for one that will go 0-60 in about two seconds forget it.  It will do it in about five seconds. It will go up hills in four gear at any speed under 60. IF you need to go faster than that just shift into third and off you go.

As a 54 year old retired teacher, this is one of the best cars to drive that I have ever owned.  It drives like my Honda prelude in the early 80's.
