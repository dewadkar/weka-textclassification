            Due to a recent car accident, I had to find a new car to purchase. My previous car was a Ford Escort ZX2. This time around and a few shaken nerves too many, I wanted a bigger car with four doors and some weight to it. My accident had been quite scary, and a small car just wouldn't cut it. My budget was limited and I wanted something that looked nice, so a few friends suggested either a Mazda dealership or perhaps Dodge. 

After comparing cars and looking around, I decided on a four door, 1997 gold Mazda 626. I decided to go with the '97 simply because the car was $5,000 cheaper then a brand new 626, it had only 32,000 miles and the interior was very clean. It came in right around my budget and when I test drove it, it felt bigger, heavier and much safer then my two-door sports car. 

Now, one month after owning the Mazda, I am still enjoying it. My friends affectionately call it my marketing girl car. They say it looks professional, and I certainly feel bigger in it. The ride is smooth, (unless you accidentally hit the overdrive button while on the freeway as I did...oops!) and the bumps just smooth out during my drive. Everything on the car functions wonderfully, and besides having to learn that I can't rip into a tiny spot anymore, the car handles well and fits most parking spots with ease. (Except for next to those people who enjoy parking on top of the lines)

I have had no mechanical problems, but then again I have only had the car for one month. My favorite item on this car, and forgive me for the cheesiness, is a little feature called &quot;Swing&quot;. Push this button and the air vents &quot;swing&quot; from side to side, giving everyone maximum air cooling. (In Florida its a nice, fair feature to have) My guests think it's pretty neat as well.

The Mazda 626 doesn't have the same pick-up off the line as the ZX2. And it is quite the gas guzzler. On last check I believe I was getting 24-28 miles per gallon. But the car gets up around 90 mph without rattles, squeaks or excessive noise. The four door option is much nicer for my guests who don't have to climb over belt restraints and wedge between sets to get in. The back seat easily fits three people, and the car comes with child restraint locks. It's fun to lock the grown-ups in. 

As the car ages, I'll continue to update this review. But so far, so good as they say. If you are looking for a car that looks nice driving to a meeting in, but doubles up on the weekend as a trip car, check out the Mazda 626. It's the right amount of car for this girl to handle.

And let's just pray to God this lasts me a bit longer than the last!<br><br>
