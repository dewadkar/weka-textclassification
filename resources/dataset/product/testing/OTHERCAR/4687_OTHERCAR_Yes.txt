            I purchased my Toyota Tundra a week and a half ago and I must say that I am totally satisfied. I have had a 1998 Toyota Camry LE for the last three years and I loved it. The Tundra rides better and quieter than the Camry, but get about half the mileage in all around driving(16 mpg vs 28). I had been reading up on everything I could (epinions, edmunds, consumer reports, tundrasolutions.com and many others) before making my purchase and I have  to say that I feel I made the right choice.  I am a former Chevy owner (1988 4X4 K1500 Silverado) and my friends and family all currently own GMC, Ford, Dodge and Chevy SUV's and pickup trucks. I have ridden and driven all of them and I liked the Tundra the best.  The only drawback is the back seat room.  I have younger kids so its fine for now. My wife and smaller adults (under 5'9" and 150 lbs) can ride in the back seat, but I would not recommend it it for more than an hour or so.  The Big 3 definetly have the Tundra beat for backseat room and available options.   The Tundra options are limited in comparison.  I ordered mine since I wanted a Blue TRD with bench seats in front and Antilock Brakes. Impossible to find here in New England.  So I ordered on 3 March 2001 and my Tundra came in as promised on 24 April 2001. SO far I have just over 700 miles on it and I am averaging just over 16mpg with mixed driving.
