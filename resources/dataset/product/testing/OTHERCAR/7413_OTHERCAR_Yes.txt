            Being a digital camera owner for over 6 years now and having shot well over 7,000 photos, I am fairly well acquainted with the nuances. I've owned digital cameras from Kodak, Fuji, Sony, and most recently Casio.

The Pros of this camera are many. Its small size belies a camera of fairly complete custom features and a fairly awesome zoom/macro capability. Unlike many digital cameras, it has an ability to allow the user to manually set focus at any point on a digital range and show the result live on the LCD, instead of offering limited and far-apart increments. Regarding the zoom features, the optical zoom is flawless and advances quickly in useful convenient increments rather than slowly in a steady progression. Even at 12x combined optical/digital zoom, scenes were clearly recognizable although somewhat mutated due to the artificial image magnification. Conversely, at macro distances down to 6cm (2.3 inches) images are bright, clear, and wonderfully defined, and furthermore the optical zoom can be used to a limited extent in macro mode (up to 1.8x). I have taken several wonderful photos of butterflies and bees with the Casio which I could not do with my longer-focus Sony DSC-P72. The large and FAST 2" LCD enable quick sizing-up and post-shot review of photos taken. The LCD is large enough to make an impromptu slide show for your friends when on the go. Once focus/exposure lock is engaged, shutter lag is very minimal, and I have captured many good shots this way that were otherwise not possible with my Sony. Whether this feature has contributed or not, I was able to take my very first shots of Mars' polar caps and continents with the Z3 through a friend's telescope at over 100x, without a mechanical aid of any kind! My Sony DSC-P30's lag/instability was sufficient to blur the image beyond recognition even with a mechanical 37mm eyepiece adaptor in place.

Now on to the Cons. Every digital camera (or film camera) is going to be different in the way it renders color, focus, white balance, etc. While some of these parameters can be ajusted by the user, some cannot. The Casio has a particular weakness (or advantage??) in that the colors tend to be a bit "flat" without correction. My Sony DSC-P72 delivers vibrant, rich colors every time a shot is taken, without any of Casio's special preset ("scenery", "portrait", "food", etc.) modes which enhance certain wavelengths of light. However, I suspect that the Sony may be pre-programmed to artificially saturate colors so as to please the "average" user who does not want color accuracy but instead wants "good"-looking pictures, similar to a "stereo bass lover" who buys a 15-inch subwoofer to reproduce frequencies which did not truly exist in the original recording. You should decide for yourself what you prefer.

The other Con is that the digital zoom tends to distort or defocus images a bit at maximum range, but then what manufacturer has a digital zoom that does not? (My Sony DSC-P72 is about the best I have ever seen, with its computer-interpolated SmartZoom feature). The distortion is not sufficient to cause real pain, only enough to annoy, and it does not always show up as severe at one time as another. I am talking here about photographing extremely small objects at great distances, such as airplanes in flight or mountain peaks. For images that will not be enlarged for detail after the shot is taken, the digital zoom blends seamlessly into the optical for an additional boost in magnification which is very welcome. As with all cameras that have a digital zoom, this feature works best by far with a smaller megapixel image size such as 1600x1200 or 1024x768.  Larger pictures won't really benefit from the digital zoom as much.

In conclusion, I'm reluctantly selling my Sony because although the image quality is slightly superior, the ease of operation, speed of repeat shots and physical size are definitely not. These factors play well into my desire to have a portable camera with me at all times so that I can catch those elusive moments where the best subject matter is revealed, such as my sailing trip last summer when dolphins suddenly leaped over the bow and the Sony was too slow to catch them. And finally, what's the point of having good features in a camera if the camera is just big enough to be bulky and heavy in a pocket and required to be sealed up in a football-sized protective case stashed in your car or your house? The Casio delivers almost-Sony functionality in a fairly small package that can be carried anywhere. And if you really want portability, go for the EX-S3 or EX-S2 cameras which have no zoom and which are twice as thin as the EX-Z3.
