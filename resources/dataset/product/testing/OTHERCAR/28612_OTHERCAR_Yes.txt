            <b>INTRO TO THE A101</b>

Of all places, Walgreens drug stores, had the Fuji A101 on sale recently for $99.00.  That's $80 cheaper than any other store is offering these days (even the bigger electronics chains) so, being the gizmo daddy I am, I had to buy one.

In the box you get the very small (approx. 4 x 2.5 x 1.5 inches) camera, wrist strap, a USB cable for downloading photos, software, an 8 meg Smart Media memory card, and two AA batteries, along with a well written manual, setup guide, etc.  The camera is very basic.  Plastic body, color LCD screen, a round navigation button on the back along with a menu, back, and display on/off button.  No complicated stuff here - it's designed for the point and shoot crowd.  On the front, is a len's cover that closes when you turn the camera off (via power switch on top), and a switch to flip between landscape focus and macro (close up) focus.

Even if I were not experienced in using a digital camera, I think I would have been up and running in 15-30 minutes max with this thing.  As it was, in 5 minutes I was snapping away in my neighborhood.  For the price, this is one heck of a camera, so here's the highlights:

<b>THE GOOD</b>

I wasn't expecting much, to be honest.  The A101 has a "fixed-focus" lens that has no zoom, so I was expecting somewhat "soft" (fuzzy) photos at best.  Not so!  Image color was excellent and vibrant, and clarity was surprisingly good for the lens.  I was <b>very</b> impressed.

Being a 1 megapixel camera with a top resolution of 1280 x 960 pixels, this will yield good 4 x 6 prints and acceptable 5 x 7.  I've tried both, and using a good printer and glossy paper, found that 4 x 6 did very well.  The 5 x 7s showed the limitation of the lens a bit, but when viewed at about 2 feet away (as though hung from a wall) they were "acceptable" - still better than I've seen from some other 1 megapixel cameras.  You can adjust 3 quality levels at this size, but I leave it on "fine" just in case you take a printable shot unexpectedly.  You can also choose a 640 x 480 pixel size, for emailable photos.

The camera runs off of 2 AA batteries.  You've heard the hype - use NiMh rechargeables.  Even so, Duracell ULTRA batteries gave me a good run. Better than you'd expect from a 2 AA camera. It's not power hungry, even when using the decent color LCD screen much of the time.  A real plus.

Not being an auto focus camera, there's no need to hold the shutter button down halfway to allow the A101 to focus.  Since it's fixed focus, just point, shoot, and continue.  Very quick, and again, sharp photos compared to others in it's class.  Deleting unwanted photos was a snap via the intuitive menu and LCD screen.  

Indoor shots with flash were well lit, colorful, and well balanced.  Stay within about 7 feet or so of your target, and you'll even get nice indoor shots.  Something some more expensive cameras still can't seem to do.

A 20 second "video" clip mode lets you take silent clips at 320 pixels in size.  Will it replace your camcorder?  UH.. no way.  But it's a "fluff" feature that's neat to play with, and one you certainly don't expect on this price of camera.

<b>THE BAD</b>

Nothing's perfect.

The "red eye" reduction feature on the flash really isn't effective.  It flashes once to close the pupil of the subject's eye, then fires and takes a photo, but glaring red (or other color) reflections still result.  If you learn to use the red eye fix on any image editing program,  you can fix this, however.

The A101 is a bit plasticy to the touch.  It might not survive a 4 foot drop on a hard floor, in my opinion. I've seen cheaper built cameras, but more solid, too. The USB port has a small gap around it (and no cover), so if you're going to use a memory card reader instead of this method to download, pics, I'd suggest putting some clear tape around the USB port, to help avoid dust getting into the camera.

<b>FINAL</b>

Other than the minor gripes above, I have literally nothing else bad to say about this camera.  If it were $300.00, perhaps, but at a going rate of $99 to $179, there is nothing more that you should expect than what you get with the A101 - and you get a lot.  Good and colorful images.  Removeable memory card capability, a decent LCD screen, and ease of use.

Get the Visa out.
