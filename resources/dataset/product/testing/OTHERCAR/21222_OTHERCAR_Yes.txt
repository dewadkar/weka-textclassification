            We bought a 2000 Toyota Camry just before Christmas - Merry Christmas to me!  I absolutely love it.  I had driven a Toyota Corolla for nearly 8 years prior to this and had no problem with getting a new Toyota - their reliability just can't be beat. We didn't even check out any other brands, we just knew we wanted a Toyota, and went with the Camry to get a little bigger car than my Corolla.

This car is a dream...it rides so smooth, and it's so plush on the inside.  Plenty of headroom and legroom, and the trunk is huge. I don't have all the little luxuries, but do have cruise control, power driver's seat, power remote outside mirrors, security system and keyless entry, all cloth interior (even the &quot;ceiling&quot;!), CD/cassette/6-speaker stereo, power doors and windows - just about everything but power passenger's seat and sunroof!  It also has a much bigger tank than what the Corolla had - I drive about 70 miles round trip to and from work every day, so now I can fill up only every 7 days instead of every 4 days!

About the only drawbacks to my Camry are the position of the cup holders - they're right behind the gear shift and in front of the center armrest, kind of an awkward position; also, instead of showing both the odometer and a trip-ometer, you can only see one at a time - and they're digital, which kind of takes some of the fun out of watching the mileage turn over to the &quot;cool&quot; numbers!

All in all, this a great car and I very much have enjoyed it for the last month.  It's bigger than what I was used to, so I have to compensate and sometimes OVERcompensate for differences in parking and turning, but it's something that I'll gladly get used to!  And we got a GREAT deal on it, too!<br><br>
