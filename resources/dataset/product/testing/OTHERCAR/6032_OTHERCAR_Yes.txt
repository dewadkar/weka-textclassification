            My Mustang had to go into the shop.  The car dealership sent me to a rental car service.  They gave me a 2002 Saturn L200.  This car just had 400 miles on it.  They had just gotten it the week before.  This car was white with tan interior.  I didn't have to drive the car but for 2 days.  But it did not use much gas.  It got really good gas mileage.   

It was bucket seats in the front and a bench seat in the back. The driver seat was power seat.  The passenger's seat was not.  There was good leg room in the front seat.  The back seat folds down into the trunk.  It has a big trunk.  There is a lot of storage space in there for a car this size.

This car had tilt, cruise, power door locks, power windows, 2 air bags, automatic transmission,  and an am/fm stereo with a cd player. It also had the remote lock, unlock, trunk, and panic button.   The only funny thing about this car is the automatic window placement.  It was in the center behind the gear shift.  That seemed like an odd place to me, instead of on the door.

It was a 4 cylinder car.  For a 4 cylinder it had "get up and go"  power behind it.  The car drove very well.  It held on to turns really well.  It rode quietly.  The air conditioner was really cold.  It got cold fast.  I don't know about the heater.  It was hot outside when I had this car.

Thank you for reading and good night!!  Leave me comments!
