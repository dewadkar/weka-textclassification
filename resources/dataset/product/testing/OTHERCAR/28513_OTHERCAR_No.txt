            Don't get me wrong.  I love Saabs...old ones.  My Dad owned a Saab, my uncle has owned many Saabs.  My brother-in-law has an 83 Saab 900 with over 200K miles on the original engine.

Since I can remember, I have wanted a Saab.  I finally had the means to buy one and found a great lease deal on a new 1999 Saab from a dealer I knew well.  I negotiated a low residual and figured if I had good luck with it, I could buy it off lease.  I was delighted with the car for about a year.  It ran excellent and had everything I had ever wanted in a car, from heated leather seats to powerful 200hp engine.  

After driving the car for a year and and caring for it meticulously, things started to go wrong.  Nothing major but little things that added up.  Luckily, the car was under warranty so I paid for nothing.  In dollars anyway.  I paid in other ways by spending a great deal of personal time at the dealership.  I am now such a regular at the dealership I am familiar with most of the dealer's employees on a nickname basis.  Examples of items which have broken include climate control (4 times), radio (3 times), sunroof, seat molding (4 times), etc.  I have had the carpet replaced because it would not stay down and the door latches replaced multiples times because I was unable to open the doors.  There are so many more (I have a 2 page spreadsheet full) but you get the picture.  Nothing has gone wrong with the powertrain and nothing has been a major inconvenience but the trips to the dealer to get them fixed have become very tiresome.

The last straw was exhaust smell coming into the passenger cabin.  Saab insisted that it was "bad gas" that we were using.  It wasn't until I complained multiple times and had a regional Saab representative test drive the car that Saab agreed that the smell was excessive and had the catalytic converter replaced on the car.  It took about nine months though.

I must say that the dealership has been spectacular.  However, they were unable to do very much without Saab's assistance which has been non-existent.

My lease is up in May and I cannot wait for them to take the car away.  In this regard, leasing is the best (luckiest) decision I have ever made.  I would not want the responsibility of having to sell this car to another unsuspecting buyer.  I know that I probably bought a rare lemon and that others have been very satisfied with their Saabs.  However, when I have had things replaced on the car that continue to break and the manufacturer tells me outright that it has passed the lemon law statute so I am on my own, I cannot recommend the brand to anyone.  Particularly after some safety issues (such as faulty door latches) keep cropping up.

We have just ordered a 2002 Audi A4 to replace the Saab and anxiously await the delivery of our new car.
