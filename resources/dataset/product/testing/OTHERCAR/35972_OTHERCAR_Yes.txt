            The Honda Civic has long maintained a reputation for being a good, solid, dependable vehicle, and I am pleased to say I agree, now that I own one. They look great, especially with a spoiler, with their sporty, yet refined profile.  The Civic is a balance of all that is good with cars - sporty yet classy, dependable and fun to drive, high resale value - but who wants to sell it? etc...

I own an EX, and I must say that it is an absolute pleasure to drive on sunny Spring afternoons with the sunroof open and your favorite CD blasting from the surprisingly good 6-speaker stereo system.  When I make the 2-hour drive from school to home on many weekends, the ride is quite stable and comfortable, with minimal road noise intruding into the cabin.  Although it is a relatively small car, the Civic has a remarkably large trunk. I can fit everything AND the kitchen sink in that bad boy. 

Parents - get this car for your child, as it is sporty, but not too sporty (insurance isn't all that bad), fun and reliable. An all around great car from a great company.   <br><br>
