            In 96 I decided that it was time to get my first official car.  I had other cars but they were always purchased with the help of my parents.  This time I was out of college and would be the sole person responsible for this purchase.  I had long before decided I didn�t want a sports car.  I recognize the fact that my driving ability would just get me in trouble in a seriously fast car.  

So, I decided to look at the mid range luxury cars.  I also decided I would get a 4 door to make carrying around my friends and family a more simple undertaking.  I went shopping and on the second day I saw a 1995 Grand Am SE 4 door sedan, teal in color.  I fell for this car almost on site.  Then I took a ride in it and I was hooked.  I bought it the second time I looked at it.  I wanted to make sure it wasn�t an impulse buy so I waited a few days and looked at other cars.

I am very pleased with this car.  It is a very smooth ride and isn�t bad on gas.  I have not had any problems with it in the 4 years I have owned the car.  The interior is big enough to hold 5 people comfortably.  I have had 8 people in it before and could still drive; my passengers weren�t too comfortable though.  The trunk can hold a lot more than it seems at first.  

I will warn you of my only 2 problems with this car.  The first is the gas gauge.  It does not measure the amount in the tank accurately.  I can go 25o miles on the first half tank and around 100 on the second, in city driving.  I have gotten used to this over time but would have been a handier gauge if it were accurate because there is no warning light.

The second problem I have with the car is how the trunk is put together.  The arm bars that hold the trunk lid bend in a way that can crush things if the trunk is packed close to the top.  Creative packing can get around this but it is annoying.

Don�t let those 2 problems deter you from this car though.  It is a dream to ride in for the price.  I would suggest having a CD player installed though.
