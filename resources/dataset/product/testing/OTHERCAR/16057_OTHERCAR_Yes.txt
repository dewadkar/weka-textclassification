            GEARHEADS BEWARE - this review is not for you. We bought this SUV new and still drive it. It drives like a car, not a truck. It's high enough to make you feel really safe, but not so high that it makes it difficult to get children in and out of carseats. The height of the backseat makes it easier to see the baby in the rear view mirror than in other cars (something you appreciate when you are worried about them choking, screaming, etc). There is also something about the space between the front seat and the back that makes it much easier (than with other cars) to fish toys and bottles off the floor while driving. (I don't recommend this, but if you're a parent, you know it's inevitable.) 

When the shocks are new, the baby can sleep for hours through the bumpiest of rides. It goes through shocks fast though - when they wear out, there's no mistaking it. The whole car squeaks at every bump. This Jeep is smaller than I expected. It's not for large families. We can fit much more in the Volvo Station Wagon than in the back of the Jeep, so don't buy it to haul lots of stuff. 

Our Jeep has had two very different lives - one in Oklahoma and the other in San Francisco. You learn to cherish the fast-acting air conditioning and those tinted windows in Oklahoma 100-degree summers. It drove well in the winter ice and snow, too. (Hardly ever had to even switch to 4WD to get around.) We moved to San Francisco in 1995. This puppy stays put on the steepest of hills - no rolling back with stops and starts. (I was worried about that.) 

The biggest annoyance with this Jeep has been the electrical warning system on the dash. We've had problems with it since day one. It misfires a lot - It will say &quot;coolant low&quot; even when the coolant isn't low. If you take it to a non-Jeep mechanic, expect the warning system to be screwed up because they can never seem to reset it correctly. 

As a working mother, the pros outweigh the cons on this truck.<br><br>
