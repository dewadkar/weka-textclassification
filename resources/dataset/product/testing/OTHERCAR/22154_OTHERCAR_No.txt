            I bought a DSC-350 to take some pictures of a project I was working on, since I was tires of having film developped and then scanning the pictures.  I did not need anything fancy, just a basic camera.

I bought a D-Link DSC-350 for about 100$ US, because it said it did resolutions of 1024x768, which was more than enough for me.  I returned it less than 24 hours later, and I bought an HP PhotoSmart 215, which is WAY better (although 80$ more expensive).  Here's why I promptly returned the unit:

The camera has a manual focus setting which cannot be verified from the optical viewfinder (there is no LCD).  That is, what you see in the viewfinder does not change depending on the focus adjustment you make.  Unless you have some rare talent guessing the needed focus setting, you'll end up with blurry pictures 95% of the time.

-The camera does not have a flash, but that was OK for me, since most of my pictures are in well-lit areas.  Well, this camera requires so much light to operate that it would not even let me take a picture in proximity of a 100 Watt light bulb!  I was not able to take pictures of many of the items I needed to.

-The camera is very light and flimsy.  I don't think that it would survive any kind of bump without self-destructing.
