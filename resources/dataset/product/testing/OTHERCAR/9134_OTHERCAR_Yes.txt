            Lincoln Navigator is an excellent SUV. It is big and luxurious to make it great car for all uses. The Navigator has many options to choose from. Moonroof, cellular phone, heated front and back seats, 6 CD changer, and many more options, but thats for you to decide. My friends and I like this car because it isn't tiring sitting in nice, comfortable leather seats on long road trips or just driving around to places. The Navigator is also very safe to drive around in. Airbags for front passengers, child safety locks, 4 wheel disc anti-lock break system, 3 point safety belts, anti intrusion beams and some other things. All around I think the 2000 Lincoln Navigator is a good car.   <br><br>
