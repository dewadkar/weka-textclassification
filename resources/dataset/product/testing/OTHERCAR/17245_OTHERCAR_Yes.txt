            I've had a 1988 Landcruiser for the past ten years. My wife has been secretly jealous because I've never had any problems with it, unlike her Mercedes. 

We finally traded her old car in for a '96 and now I'm the jealous one. It rides like a giant car, very good ride, not too firm, good visability, 4 wheel drive with airbags, antilock brakes, and leather interior. 

We take it everywhere on long trips. It only had 35,000 miles on it when we bought it and have had absolute no problems after another 30,000. It's really good to feel that you have a big substantial machine surrounding you with tons of metal and safety features. 

It's a great cruiser. The down sides are of course gas mileage which is poor, front brake pads wear quickly due to the weight of the vehicle (takes a lot to stop the hulk), repairs aren't cheap (even the planned maintainance). But we still have no complaints. 

It's extremely reliable, the pads are easy to change yourself as are the spark plugs, oil, etc. so I do a lot of my own routine work. It handles like a big heavy truck should handle, a little roll but not much. Has decent acceleration but no drag racer. Mirrors are a little difficult to see out of from the side.<br><br>
