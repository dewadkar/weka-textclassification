            The kia motor company makes outstanding vehicles at great prices.The quality is as good as any I have seen.For the most part of my life I have owned American made cars and while they are great cars,it is hard to beat the quality,price and dependabilty of the Kia Spectra.This is the middle line of the Kia products and it is smooth.I have test driven it several times and I am seriously thinking of purchasing one soon.It is a quiet smooth running vehicle.
  The price starts at around $10,000.00.It is a very stylish vehicle with plenty of leg room and comfort.It features a center storage console with folding arm rests and coin tray.It has dual cup holders and an overhead sunglass holder.It comes with tinted glass,split folding rear seatbacks and an 8 way adjustable driver's seat.
  The car comes with air conditioning,tilt steering wheel,tachometer.six speakers for brilliant stereo sound.It has power windows,mirrors and door locks.It has a 1.8 liter dohc and 126 horsepower.Yon can choose from a variety of colors as well.This is a great car,at a great price.
