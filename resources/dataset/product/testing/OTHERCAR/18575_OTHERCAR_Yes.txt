            The Casio QV-8000SX has held up amazingly for me.  I've owned it for over 2 years now and have even dropped it several times and there's never been a problem.  Very hardy camera!  I also love the 8x optical zoom, the swivel lens, the red-eye reduction feature, the self timer, the .avi mode, and the ability to hook it up to a tripod!  It also has a threaded lens so if you're an astronomy buff you could hook it up to a telescope!  Very sweet!

Best of all, this camera is USB, so the downloads to my computer are LICKETY-SPLIT!  So much better than the hours I'd have to wait with my old parallel-port digital camera.

The ONLY negative thing about this camera is its powerful drain on the batteries if you use the flash alot.  But it's been worth it to me.  I have taken this camera with me on many vacations including overseas.  The photos it takes are amazing!  I've had them blown up to 8x10s and they are flawless!

Don't believe me? Check out http://photos.yahoo.com/planetkcom and http://photos.yahoo.com/planetkcom2 - all were taken with my Casio!

Well, hope my review helps you out.  I whole-heartedly recommend it.
