            I purchased Toyotas in the past, but always had my eye on the Camry.  Finally, the time came when I could purchase one of Toyota's highest rated cars.

I chose a beautiful midnight blue with gold accent 1999 Camry LE.  I had always driven compact cars, so to me this vehicle was luxury!  I drove it off the lot and immediately headed for the highway to meet my new friend, cruise control.  

The car is unbelievably smooth on the highway and outside sound is nearly completely blocked out.  The vehicle gives the feeling of security and substance, and is reinforced with steel beams.

The driver and passenger front seats are comfortable; there is room to stretch.  There is not much leg room in the back but the seats are also accomodating back there.

I would highly recommend this car for people who's children are older as I do not feel it's a family car for people with small children.  It is a very nice ride though and worth every penny.<br><br>
