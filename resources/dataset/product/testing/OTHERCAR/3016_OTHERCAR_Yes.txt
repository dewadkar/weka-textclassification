            I purchased a '97 Concorde last fall.  It had 36,000 miles.  I have always driven Chrysler products and was disappointed in new body design of the 98+ vehicles.  I'd always liked the looks of the older Concordes and I needed a vehicle in which my rapidly growing pre/teen children could ride comfortably in the back seat.

I do love the roominess of the Concorde and I love the way it handles. I did have a little trouble getting used to trying to park it.  Passing is NO Problem!  In fact, I'm often amazed that I have it up to 80mph in a couple of seconds when passing another vehicle. 

Several of the luxury features I find disappointing and just unnecessary.  
The automatically adjusting day/night mirror reacts slowly to say the least.  Furthermore, certain times of the year, the sunset is in my rearview mirror on the way home.  You can't (to my knowledge) override the automatic mirror to set it on &quot;night&quot; in the afternoon.

The moon roof is great except that most of the time the sunlight in Texas is too hot.  It is also very noisy when on the highway.

The heat/air thermostat can be tricky.  In the winter when I first get into the car, I tend to turn the temp to 80+.  Then when it starts to get warm, if I turn it down to 70 all at once, it automatically thinks it has to blow cold air to cool the car to 70!  Opposite is true with A/C.

The electric locks/alarm are wonderful, although I wish it would &quot;chirp&quot; rather than honk the horn when arming the alarm remotely.  I have noticed on various occasions when I hit the lock, there is a noise on the passenger side like the sound the electric seats make.  I began to wonder, when a co-worker who has a '94 Concorde reported he had a similar problem which resulted in the locks just constantly locking and unlocking until his battery was dead.  I'd be curious to know if this is a problem that has existed in this car or just a coincidence. 

The onboard computer that tells how many miles to empty is unreliable.  Sometimes it tells me DTE is 5 miles and by the time I've driven 5 miles, it shows DTE is 17.  

A final annoyance is that the only cup holders are positioned so that a cup could easily be knocked over when reaching for the gear shift console.
