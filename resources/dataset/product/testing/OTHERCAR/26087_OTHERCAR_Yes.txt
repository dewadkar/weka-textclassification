            In September 1999, I decided to purchase a 1999 Mazda Protege primarily because of the great deal I was getting on the leftover models. 
I was replacing a 1992 Saturn which I was always satisfied with by wanted something a little less inexpensive yet just as reliable. 
 Every member of my immediate family owns a Mazda of some sort so I decided to give them a shot. 
 The car came with everything extra you could want; CD player, power locks/windows, cruise control, etc. 
 The car has already made it through a pretty bad accident back in April 2000, in which it held up very well. 
 The gas mileage is good and the ride is exceptionally smooth. 
 I am quite comfortable driving this car everyday back and forth to work (a total of 60 miles).
  The only problem I have had so far is that occasionally the CD player doesn't work. 
 Not a big deal for a car I paid so little for.  
I am a student, I work full-time, and I support myself and I find it easy to keep up with my car payments. 
 I recommend this car to anyone who is looking for a small, sturdy, practical car.
  It is surely a great buy (especially compared to a Honda Civic).  
If you are interested in a mid-size car, I would recommend checking out the 626 model. 
 All in all, both I, and my whole family is satisfied with the Mazda experience.<br><br>
