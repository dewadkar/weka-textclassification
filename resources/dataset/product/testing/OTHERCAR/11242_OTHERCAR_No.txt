            I recently unloaded my headache of a 1998 Olds Achieva, with close to 50000 miles, which I only owned the shop loving car for less than a year.
I had rented one of these cars thinking it was the coolest and one of nicest cars I had ever driven... But when it came to using one of these cars for my Job did I get a great surpise.  A car that had only 21000 miles and a new set of tires at $13000 in March of 1999 needed front brakes.. and less than 16000 miles later front and rear brakes and tires too.  Not to stop at that I then got well introduced to the check engine light that became rather costly and not covered by the wonderfuly extended warranty.  At first I had believed that this was due to excessive use for my Job.. then it was brought to my attention that a friend of mines sister had a 1997 that at about 50000 miles did the same things... I would like to believe I got a lemon and that Oldsmobile didn't just not care...
As far as the disign and comfort I really liked the car but I need one that will keep running without having to stop at a shop about every two weeks and cost me close to $200 or more a trip.  And I sure hate wondering what is going to fowl up from start up to start up.
The Luxury of the car was awesome...the dependibility was not so good after 48000 miles.  I belive it to be a good car for someone that only plans to use it for 10000 miles or less a year, that plans to keep it till the loan is paid off at the low miles.. due to the value did not hold when it came to trade in time.<br><br>
