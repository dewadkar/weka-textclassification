            I have purchased 2 of these cameras, and my husband and I are extremely happy with our camera.

Beautiful pictures, easy use and easy for stressed and overburdened parents to take with them and save precious memories.  Not only this, but the technology is top of the line, your memories wont become obsolete, since the resolution is so wonderful.  That was my biggest worry in purchasing a digital camera.

Until purchasing this camera I was a die hard Nikon 35mm film photograper.  But, this is so easy and cost effective.

My husband was able to email the kids pictures of his travels, during his work imposed separation from us.  These pictures in emails, helped assauge the pain of separation for them.

There are no more piled up film cannisters waiting for money to develope them.  Just download the pics easily on your hard drive, and make a cd.

No more need to mail pics, just email them to Grandparents and godparents.

I am ecstatic about this camera.  I have seen others and this one is so lightweight but sturdy.  A/V outputs allow the pics to be shown on the TV also, and even recorded on a vhs tape.  

Versatile - Can take pictures or AV video with sound.

Here are some specs on the camera:
