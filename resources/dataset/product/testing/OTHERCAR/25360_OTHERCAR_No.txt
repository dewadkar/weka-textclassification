            I can't really say much about the Agfa ePhoto CL-30 Clik! because mine broke before I really started using it.  The problem is that I put in fresh batteries and the camera thinks that they're already dead.  I am, however, getting a refund from Agfa (they would give me a new one but they're out).
Still, I can tell you a few other things about the camera.  First of all, the camera has almost one megapixel, no more.  Agfa claims the software will increase the resolution to one point five megapixels, but it doesn't, as far as I can tell, do much of anything.  In fact, the only good thing I have to say about the software is that it is relatively easy (probably because there aren't too many features to figure out).
Also, don't be fooled by "digital zoom."  Digital zoom means that the camera takes a picture at its "low" resolution setting and then crops it to zoom in on the middle.  You can do your own digital zooming with any basic photo software.  If you want to zoom in on something you need optical zoom.
Now some nice things about the camera.  The LCD screen works to show you pictures stored on the camera, but when taking pictures it does blur for a long time when you move the camera (on the other hand if you're moving the camera during a picture the LCD screen isn't your problem).  A lot of people say that they don't like the camera's slow recovery time.  I don't know what they're taking pictures of, but I have not yet encountered a situation in which I feel the need to take two pictures in less than ten seconds.  Tech support is helpful and they don't put you on hold, on the other hand it would be better if you didn't have to use it.  The resolution is good, and would probably be nice for normal size and maybe even five by seven prints, but past that would be stretching it.
Now the two really nice things I have to say about the camera:  It's very easy to use, everything is practically self-explanatory, and navigating menus is easy.  And most importantly, probably the best reason to buy this camera: the Clik! drive.  You get a nice amount of memory for next to nothing.  In fact I would say that at this point Clik! disks are the best system for memory on a camera, no exceptions.  However, this fall a new type of removable memory--DataPlay discs which are the size of a quarter and hold up to 500 megabytes--will be released and will make the Clik! discs look silly.
