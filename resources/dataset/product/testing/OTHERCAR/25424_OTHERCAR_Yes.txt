            This Saturn is the second Saturn that I have purchased and these are the reasons why:  
Outside Looks:  The Saturn SC is a very sporty looking vehicle without the &quot;Sporty Insurance Rates&quot;.  I have a Red Saturn that is very sporty looking, but without the affects of the high insurance rate.

Inside Looks:  The inside of my Saturn is grey.  It doesn't show much dirt at all.  It's a little cramped as far as the back seat goes.  If someone had to ride in the back seat all of the time...they would get cramped legs due to lack of leg space.  The design of the inside of the vehicle is nice and sporty looking.

Reliability:  The Saturn SC1 is a very reliable vehicle.  Never had anything wrong with it other than just routine maintenance.

Other Pros about the Saturn:  It gets great gas mileage, drives great on open highways and dirt roads.  It goes great in snow even though it is not 4-WD.<br><br>
