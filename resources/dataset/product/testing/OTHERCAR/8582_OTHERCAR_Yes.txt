            I bought my car in May of '99 with about 36,000 miles on it and absolutely love the car! Other then the few squeaks in the dashboard that everyone seems to be mentioning i haven't had any problems.  Only time it has been to the shop was for new tires which was because of my own curb hitting ( :) 

The car handles great in any weather..and Being from Wisconsin we have every kind of weather here! 

I bought the car mainly because i needed a reliable first time car..and test drove it a few times...had my brother test it out and i fell in love with it..i know you shouldn't fall in love with a car...but i did..:)

Only thing i have to complain about really is those back doors...yes they are great and open wide for putting kids in the back seat...but The corners are super sharp!!! and leave bruises if you catch them just right..but other then that the Car is AWESOME!!!

I would recommend a Grand am to anyone!
