              I currently own a 1990 Nissan Maxima with 185,000 miles that runs better than any American car with 75,000 miles.  With only regular preventative maintenance, the 3.0 L engine remains in excellent shape.  The leather in the SE remains in very good condition after 10 years of use as well as the other interior components such as the Bose stereo system.   The body remains in excellent condition with only minimal  rust. 

The 1990 SE model, with a 199 horse engine packs quite a punch.  The McPhereson struts in all four corners combined with four wheel disc brakes makes for an excellent handling car.  I as well as my friends and family are amazed how well the Maxima performs.  I can only imagine the wonder of having the current (2000 model) 222 horsepower engine.  For these reasons, the Maxima is also a great car if you are interested in speed and power.   

If you're looking for power, reliability, value, and style, the Nissan Maxima is a great choice, old or new.<br><br>
