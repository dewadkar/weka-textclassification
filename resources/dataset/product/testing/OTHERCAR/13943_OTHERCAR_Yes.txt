            I urge anyone considering an SUV who is not looking for a behemoth like the Expedition or the Suburban to give the Outback a test drive.  It has many fine qualities of an SUV, such as higher seating, plentiful cargo space, and most important of all, all wheel drive.  But it has many fine qualities of a car, as well, including ease of entry and exit, ease of parking, nimble handling, and relative fuel economy.  I have had my Legacy Outback for just short of two years now, and I have yet to spend a penny on repairs, and the only required maintenance has been periodic oil changes.  I expect to keep the car for years, and I would gladly purchase another.  It is peppy enough for highway acceleration, quite comfortable for long trips, has a adequate stereo system, and a more than adequate air conditioner.  The dogs and the kids love being in it, and it makes the obligatory trips to Home Depot and the warehouse stores a pleasure.  Even if you think you want a Jeep Grand Cherokee or an Explorer, give the Outback a try.  It will deliver almost all of what you are looking for for a much lower price.<br><br>
