            I am an owner of a 1981 Oldsmobile Cutlass, and I have to admit that it is the most comfortable car I have ever been in.  My friends comment that it is like riding in a couch, because it is so comfortable.  It provides a smooth ride, and it provides the appearance and reliability of a luxury car.

The car was originally my grand-mother's, and when I turned 16 she gave it to me.  The car is practically a mint, because at the time that she gave the car to me in 1997, it only had 10,000 miles on it.  It is now almost 19 years old, and it is as good as new. 

There is never a problem with the car, and it does not guzzle the gas as some cars do these days.  I am a proud owner of a Cutlass, and I would not want to trade the car in for the world.<br><br>
