            I brought this car in the end of 1983, it's painted red. four doors, 5 gears manual box.

for almost 20 years of driving, there aren't any major repair being done on the car. Although the gasket have been changed for twice (10 years once), it's a find car that you could find.

The engine is terrific,it's a 1300cc 4 cyln in-line engine, after 20 years of driving, it's still sound like new, no major shaking or vibration.  The only problem now with the engine is the valve is a little of aged so it tends to leak the engine oil the the burning process. Just a little bit. So again, no matters, Afterall, it's 20 years old!

The exterior is excellent, no rust or cracks. Unlike Honda cars, Nissan really built for life. The bumper is the best among all the cars, with 2 shock asorber built in the rear bumper, it's great, I'm being hit by many cars from the back, but the bumper seems protect it all. With no quality defect too, the bumper seem bounce back to shape after being hit!

The interier is too, still in good condition, all meters and indicators are still working as new. Although the fin on the aircon't breaks when the car is 12 years old, but that doesn't really matters.


It's a great car to be and I definely will not sell it until it is condamed :-)
It's have good 2nd hand value. It's a great budget that should not be miss.
