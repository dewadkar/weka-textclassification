            The Chevrolet Suburban is THE classic SUV.  Chevrolet was making these automobiles long before big four-wheel-drives became popular, and before the acronym SUV was even coined.

When I met my husband, he was driving a teeny little Geo tracker.  I have a Jeep Cherokee, which will comfortably seat five -- if three of the five have no legs!  In less than a year, the single man became head of household to a family of five.  Then Granny came to live us -- Just before the baby was to be born!  We had long outgrown Jeep, and the Tracker was looking a lot like Little Tikes.  We had to do something, quick.

We never even considered vans.  First, I hate how they look.  Furthermore, we live at the top of a very steep gravel driveway, on the side of a mountain.  We needed four-wheel-drive!  The sudden family increase had put a huge strain on the budget, so money was a definite consideration.  

We needed something big enough to seat seven, low enough for our 92-year-old Granny to get in and out of, that would ride smooth on the highway but still climb the driveway.

Below I have listed the automobiles we considered, and why we didn't purchase them.

Ford Expedition -- Nice to look at, almost as long as the Suburban, but much less interior room.  Also, new truly USED Expeditions were available, since they are so new.

Dodge Durango -- Ditto but more so.  Love how it looks, but its just really not that big.  This would be a good vehicle for a normal-sized family who occasionally needed extra capacity.

Chevy Suburban -- We looked at lots of 'em.  We even found one that had a bench seat in the front, which was great!  But it was 2-wheel drive :-(

We finally bought a used Suburban with over 200,000 miles on it. The transmission had been replaced, so we felt it would keep on trucking.

Our Suburban now has over 230,000 miles on it!  It has only needed one minor repairs -- a radiator leak which cost $25 to fix.  Once we took off the cheap aluminum steps, it doesn't look &quot;old.&quot;  We love our Suburban!  We have taken it on many long trips and it is sooooo comfortable.  As big as it is, I've found that it's not difficult to drive and park.  If you need a REAL SUV, get a Suburban.<br><br>
