            The Sterling nameplate is little known in the US.  This car had a very limited production run from 1986 to 1991 in the states.  The car was basically an Acura Legend with fancy coachwork.  Honda did all of the mechanicals on the car (engine, suspension, chassis) while the British firm Rover, did the body work and interiors.  

I myself do not own a Sterling, but I have driven a few and I�m a huge fan of the car.  Rarity is the car�s magic.  If you are lucky enough to own one, you will most likely see 2-3 others in a year�s time even if you live in a major city like I do.  The rarity can also be a curse though.  Parts such as body panels and interior trim are impossible to get.  There is a place in Houston, Texas that special orders parts from Rover but their list is very limited.  However, this is a minor problem.  If you care for the car and avoid damaging the body and interior, you should be fine.  

The car can be serviced by any Acura dealership since it is the same as every Legend that rolled out between the aforementioned years.  For those not familiar with the Legend, it was the car that showed the world that the Japanese could build luxury cars that were world class.  Things such as 4 wheel independent suspension, 4 wheel disc brakes, and just plain solid build quality are incorporated into the design.  With proper care, the engines in these cars can do well over 300K miles.  

The exterior design is rather ordinary on the Sterling.  Although, it is an interesting bit of trivia to know that all body panels were laser aligned at the factory in England.  That aside, it can be said that the design is rather bland.  The car looks very ordinary and plain Jane.  There are no gorgeous lines, elaborate trim parts, or fancy wheels.  It just looks like a car.  However, when you get inside, things change SO MUCH!   The cabin is first class all of the way!  This is the part of the car the money went into.  Everything is power operated.  All seats, windows, locks, sunroof, etc.  It even has power adjustments for the rear seats!  Plush leather covers all seating areas.  I�m not sure what type of leather this is, but I would say it has a glove soft feel to it.  

Dash and door trim is decked out in genuine wood trim instead of that plastic stuff with wood grain stickers.  I can attest to this because I have seen a Sterling in a junkyard where the door was smashed and the wood was broken��it is real wood.  HVAC controls along with the instruments are very Honda in design; large, easy to read, well thought out.  The radio is very elaborate.  The 91 models had a weather band in addition to the outstanding stereo.  Some of the perks of owning such a special car include great attention to detail.  For example, the door sills are covered in a finely polished steel plate, the door opening trim in lined in felt, and the sun shade in the roof has slits in it that permit the �just right� amount of light to some through.  Oh, the glass is also tinted in a pale bronze.  This sounds bad, but in reality it makes the interior of the car look much more expensive from the outside.  

The ride is smooth and comfortable.  The 2.7 V6 moves the car well and you have enough power on tap at all times.  See a Legend review if you need more information. I highly recommend this car.  It might very well be a collectable in the future, but even if it is not, owning one will allow you to experience something that only a select few drivers get to.  A nice example can be had for under $5000
