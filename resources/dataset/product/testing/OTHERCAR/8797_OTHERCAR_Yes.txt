            After trading in my mom's old <i>1990 Honda Accord</i>, my dad decided to go again with yet another Honda.  This time he purchased the <b>2000 Honda Accord Sedan</b>.  

The <b>2000 Honda Accord Sedan</b> is a very reliable, sleek, and steady vehicle.  Being my father's getting up there in age and his reactions are not as fast as they used to be, he needed a vehicle which would respond well with very little response time.  The Accord works well for him.

Features of the <b>2000 Honda Accord</b> include a 4 Cylinder, 2.3 Liter, 150 Horsepower Engine, getting between 25 and 31 MPG.  On the trip which I was on with my father we probably got about 28 MPG.  I was amazed that we were able to travel for about two hours on less than 1/2 of a tank of gas in this vehicle.  Having driven my 2000 Impala around town, I couldn't have done that!

Other features of this car include:  Air conditioning, Driver side airbag, Passenger side airbag, Anti-lock brakes, Anti-theft vehicle, Cruise control, Rear defogger, Power locks, Power mirrors, Power steering, Power windows, AM/FM radio, Cassette, Second row folding seats, Tachometer, Tilt steering, and Automatic transmission.  

The back seat of the 2000 Honda Accord is also very comfortable and roomy.  We were able to get a lot of cargo into one side of the back seat without the passenger feeling cramped sitting on the other side.  It's very easy to fall asleep in the back seat as well.

There are only a couple of things that I do not like about this vehicle having gone with my father on a four hour trip.  

One of the things that I do not like about the Accord is that the back seat passenger seatbelts are too &quot;sensitive&quot;.  Once you put the seat belt on, if there is any movement whatsoever, even if it is to sift your weight slightly the seatbelt will lock and you'll start to feel constrained unbearably.  The only way to stop this is to unbuckle the seatbelt and then refasten it.  This may be an annoyance to children sitting in the back seat, so if they are complaining that the seatbelt is bothering them, then BELIEVE them and let them unbuckle it and refasten it!  

The second thing that I didn't like about the Accord is that when I was sitting in the back seat, that I couldn't hear the individuals who were speaking in the front seat hardly at all when they were trying to have a conversation with me.  There was a lot of air resistance sound such as you hear in an airplane where I could not understand what was being said.  This may sound like a trivial complaint, but it was very annoying to me when my dad wanted to talk to me about things and I couldn't hear him.

Overall, I am really impressed with the quality and construction of the Honda Accord.  They've proven their reliability with our family as many of our family members own these types of vehicles and I have no problem with highly recommending them to you for purchase.<br><br>
