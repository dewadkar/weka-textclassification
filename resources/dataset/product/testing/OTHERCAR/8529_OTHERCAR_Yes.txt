            After a dozen plus years of having the reasonable size convertible market all to themselves with the LeBaron Chrysler decided in 1996 to up the ante with the Sebring.  Three years into the model they seem to have it pretty well down.  If you want a convertible that will take a family of four on a long wekend trip - this is it.

<b>APPEARANCE</b>  Admittedly this is where Chrysler put all their marbles.  It looks great.  People ask about it all the time.  They seem to have this thing for funny paint colors once you get past black, white and red.  Mine's been described as deep blue, dark purple or even black.  Actually, it's &quot;Deep Amythest Pearl Clearcoat.&quot;  OK.  Whatever - it looks nice though with the gold package that came on it (I would not recommend that - it was already there when I bought it) and the gold accent wheels if I ever wanted a second career as a pimp I wouldn't have to buy another car for it....

<b>RELIABILITY</b>  Ever since my experience with a Ford Windstar I am very wary of endorsing reliability on a car that doesn't have some very serious mileage on it.  This one's just about at 38,000.  That said it has not been a problem so far.  Keep in mind that I was brought dragging and kicking into the Chrysler fold - for the very reason mentioned above - they were the only people who made what I wanted.  Now I'm used to Hondas and their legendary &quot;thunk&quot; when the doors close.  This doesn't do that but it doesn't clang either.  It's your basic middle of the road quality American car.

<b>PERFORMANCE</b>  OK, now the bad news.  Much has been made of the dismal 0 - 60 time on this car and deservedly so.  It's not molasses slow but while looking so fast it doesn't move very quickly.  0- 40 isn't bad but then it kind of loses it.  While the car is under-horsepowered I think the transmission is more at fault than the engine.  Such is life.  As long as you're not planning on racing it's powerful enough.  Just.

What's more alarming to me is the 60 - 0 result.  This car has mushy brakes.  Stomp 'em.  If you are used to cars that stop on a dime you may want to consider a roll of dimes on this one.  Don't tailgate and you'll be OK.  The handling is quite nice.  It's actually a lot of fun to drive - even with the top up!

<b>THIS AND THAT</b>  If you are used to convertibles this one is nice and quiet.  If you are not you'll think it's loud - part of the price you pay to have a top that goes down.  The really good news that if you get the Infinity stereo with it you can sterilize mice at 600 feet.  Man, it is a kicker of a stereo - lots of oomph - loads off bass - I can travel at 70 with the top down and still have good sound - and I'm picky.

<b>SUMMARY</b>  Great little value - an awful lot of fun.  It will be interesting to see what happens come summer when Toyota actually come out with their competing product - the Solara convertible.  Until then you do loads worse than this one.<br><br>
