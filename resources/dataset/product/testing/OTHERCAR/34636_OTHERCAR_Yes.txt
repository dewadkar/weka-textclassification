            My parents have always owned Chrysler minivans. Their first minivan was a Voyager and it was good to them, so they bought another Voyager in 1995. They still have that van, but once their other car died, they decided that they needed a newer minivan. Being a Pontiac man, I suggested the Montana. They always liked Pontiacs and trust the reliability of GM, so they checked it out. They found a 2000 Pontiac Montana extended minivan. It is a beautiful dark blue with the platinum trim on the bottom and a tan interior. I am a big guy, 6'5&quot; tall, so I always have had problems with legroom and headroom in their Voyagers. I was amazed at the large amount of head and leg room that I had in the front, middle, and back seats of the van. The seats were comfortable and the captains chairs in the middle were a nice feature. The van also drives very nicely. It has good power and excellent handling. It definitely doesn't drive like a minivan. The gauges are all easy to read and the stereo puts out a good sound. The rear air and dual sliding doors are also a good touch. So far I haven't been able to find a negative thing about this van and neither have my parents. They absolutely love it. 

THE GOOD: The 3.4L V6 is very powerful. It has plenty of power to propel my family down the road. It is also one of the best engines that GM makes - it is practically bulletproof. 

THE BAD: Nothing yet!

THE UGLY: The paint on the door handles is a little wavy.

And this is for tennis_player. The van is a 3.4L V6, Auto tranny(as is every Montana ever made), and cost $25000(worth ever penny)<br><br>
