            My 1999 Buick Regal GS was due to be turned in from lease, and we were looking for a car with the same amenities. We didn't necessarily want another Buick. The local Buick dealer suggested that we include this Hyundai in our comparison. Of course, they sold those as well. A HYUNDAI???? I wasn't going to drive a Hyundai, no way. The salesman urged me to "just give it a try." I said, "Why not?"

When I saw the outside of the car, an XG350L, it seemed like a slightly larger, and less stylish Sonata. It looked nice but I wasn't too impressed. Then we got into the thing
and WOW, it was a surprise! The interior was fitted with fake wood trim that looks great, beautiful leather seats, even adjustable rear headrests! Both front seats have electric adjustments, and adjustable lumbar support. The drivers side adds the ability to adjust height and tilt, as well as the common fore and aft, and seatback angle. The console control layout is appealing, and complete. There are, of course, two map lights in front, a dome light in the middle, and a switchable reading light on each side of the rear seating area. The map lights can be turned on and off as usual, and can also be set to turn on when a door is opened. The dome light has the usual three-position switch. The L model has dual memory for the position of the driver's seat and outside mirrors. This also has a selectable feature that lowers the outside mirror view when you put the car in reverse, and moves the seat fore and aft when you insert or remove the ignition key, respectively. Unfortunately, if you turn off the ignition right after moving the shift lever to Park, before the mirrors return to their normal position, they stop moving. The next time you start the car, the outside mirrors will be lower than they should, then when you engage reverse again, they'll go even lower, and so forth. This means that if the mirrors haven't returned to their normal setting before turn off the ignition, you will have to use the driver memory feature to restore them to normal position the next time you drive the car.

The steering wheel has only three buttons, and they are all for the cruise control: Accel/Resume, Cancel, and Decel/Set. The on/off switch for this is on the lower edge of the dash near the door. It is turned off every time you start the car. The steering wheel should have controls for the sound system, and/or climate control, maybe a future model year will have these. Speaking of the sound system, it's pretty good. There are tweeters in the upper part of the driver's and passenger's doors. However, the 8-CD changer is located in the trunk, this needs to be modernized. 

I drove it. It is incredibly quiet. Sadly, the steering and brakes have little feel, but the suspension soaks up every bump. When driving over paving stones, they were barely audible! The car understeers more then expected. The accellerator takes some getting used to, because when you start from a dead stop the car tends to lurch forward. It is hard to modulate the pedal so as to avoid this. The stopping distance is good, but the mushy feel of the brake pedal belies this. The L trim level comes with traction control in addition to the standard ABS. The car behaves pretty well when asked to respond quickly, but it's no sports car. In fact, it falls well short of the Regal GS in the handling and responsiveness categories. The tires squeal at the slightest provocation.

The engine, though a step down from the 240 HP and 280 ft-lbs of the Regal GS, is adequate. The output is 194 HP, and 216 ft-lbs. Coupled with the 5-speed automatic transmission, this propels the car onto the freeway quite confidently. The engine produces a pleasing muted growl when pushed. It's noisier than I would expect it to be at idle. Some friends have mistaken it for a diesel when idling. The transmission has a "Sport Stick" position that lets you choose your own gears, and the current choice is indicated by a LED on the dash, a nice touch. Unfortunately, the cruise control cannot be engaged if you choose your own gear.

There are only four options available in the L trim level. Most cars come with all of these: floor mats, CD changer, cargo net, and a wind deflector for the moonroof. Everything else is included, and I mean everything! The windows are slightly tinted right from the factory, but we'll need to add tint to make the car habitable in Arizona.

I don't have the wind deflector installed on the moonroof, since I think it's ugly, and partially obstructs the view (as with any car). Even without the deflector, it's pretty quiet with the moonroof open.

The most impressive thing about this car is the attention to detail. The center console is equipped with a drawer. You press it in slightly, then release it and it opens- oh, but it has viscous damping, so it doesn't just pop open! The same is true of the cupholder and ashtray lids. The hanger hooks in the rear seating area are recessed, and also open when you push them in and release them. There are three power outlets: one in the ashtray at the front of the center console, one near the rear ashtray at the back of the console, and one inside the console. There's a removable plug in the shallow compartment under the center armrest. This allows you to store your phone in that upper compartment, and plug your phone's charger into the outlet in the bottom of the lower compartment. The plug can be replaced by using a coin to lock it in position.

The car is equipped with a great climate control system. The temperature was in the low 90's when I picked the car up from the dealer and within a few minutes I was chilly, and had to raise the temperature setting. The adjustable rear air vents will be of great help to rear seat passengers, and they can be aimed just like the front ones. There's a control on the center console to turn the rear air on and off. The vents themselves are nicely finished and can be aimed more smoothly than the vents in any car in recent memory.

The L car is equipped with front seat and outside mirror heaters. The rear view mirror is autochromic, but that feature cannot be turned off, which is annoying.

Now, for a few needed improvements: 1) The autochromic mirror feature should be able to be turned off, and the driver's side mirror needs this feature as well. That way when a pickup truck is behind you showing his massive light output from his high beams, you can avoid the discomfort from both mirrors automatically. 2) The driver's seat automatic fore/aft adjustment on key insertion/removal should be unhinged from the parking brake. Who uses the parking brake on level ground in a car with automatic transmission? The feature doesn't operate without it. 3) Refine the wallowy suspension make the handling more neutral and precise, even if that means sacrificing a bit of the amazing silence when the car is in motion. And give the driver a little tactile steering and brake feedback. 4) Put audio controls, and the cruise control on/off button on the steering wheel. 5) Add some missing items to the owner's manual- like the CD changer operation (not even mentioned); that the parking brake needs to be engaged to operate the auto seat adjustment; that the cruise speed can be incremented or decremented in one mph increments by clicking the accel/decel buttons, etc. 6) The LED displays on the audio, climate control, and trip computer are not bright enough to be viewed in bright daylight- at times they're invisible, these should be vacuum fluorescent. 7)There needs to be a button for the electric door locks on the passenger side door. Locking that door manually locks all of the doors, but only the passenger door is unlocked when the lever is moved. So if the driver leaves the car to run into a store, but leaves the keys with the car's occupants, they need to reach over and unlock the driver's side door. That's not too appealing in a car that purports to be a luxury car.

The warranty is the best in the business. The first 12 months it's completely bumper-to-bumper; for the first five years or 60,000 miles, it's bumper-to-bumper with a few exclusions; the drivetrain (including the timing belt) is warranted for ten years or 100,000 miles, and there's five years of roadside assistance with unlimited miles.

Get in the car and try it. You're in for a big surprise. Yes, it's a Hyundai! The bottom line is "Driving is believing"!

Addendum: Now that we've had the car for a few weeks, we have waxed it. As we worked on it, my wife and I noticed what appeared to be chipped paint on the rear bumper, and also at the bottom of the passenger entry. One of these is about an inch long, and very noticeable. It might not be what we thought. When I was using a towel to remove excess wax from the crevice between the driver's side quarter panel, and the upper surface at the side of the bumper, some paint rubbed right off the bumper! This resulted in what looks like a chip, also about an inch long, but very narrow. I'll report back on what is done to remedy this.

Our Buick has but a single scratch and that is on the rear bumper, but I caused it by pushing another car. So I don't think that any of these blemishes are our fault.
