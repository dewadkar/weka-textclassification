            I have this camera and after a week of using it, I'm still learning things it can do.  I found colors coming out wrong, but you have to manually choose the type of light source you are using and after you do, the colors are wonderful and rich.  The details almost rival a great 35mm camera.
There are so many options you can make to get the right shot for you. (Like using the LCD as a TV/VCR monitor!).  
However, the manual is not clear is some areas...for instance, the digital zoom can only be set in the &quot;still shot&quot; mode.  ...etc.
Don't even think of using regular Alkaline batteries...this thing eats them for dinner...use a NiMH instead!!!
I was previously using a 640x480 Mavica and now it seems like a toy compared to the Ricoh RDC-5300.  Hats off to Ricoh!!<br><br>
