            This car is great! I love almost everything about it. We bought it used at a great price with 86,000 KM's, and now, only just 4 months later, we have over 100,000 KM's on it.Only one brake job, and everything else (except the windshield wipers) are mint.

  VALUE

    It is hard to put in words what kind of a value this car is, and how to get people to believe it. Someone would think, looking at a '97 Concorde, it looks sort of dated compared to the 2001 cars - sort of rough around the edges, and it is a get-what-you-pay-for situation. No. It is so much more than you pay for. Today, 1997 Concordes and Intrepids are going for ridiculously low prices. I guess it's the depreciation, or maybe the new models are selling very well. Any way you want to look at it, I think this car is quite possibly one of the best used car values on the market (next to a Cadillac, where the price halves in 2 years). That is, of course, if you intend to keep the car around for a while. The Concorde is powerful, quiet, handles like a dream, and it is incredibly comfortable, even when loaded with passengers. The leather buckets are 8-way adjustable for excellent comfort, and they are contoured great. The adjustable lumbar on the drivers side is nice (although it would be nice if it was on the passenger side too).

   POWER/PERFORMANCE/MECHANICAL

I love the power of the 214 horsepower 3.5L V6 - I can effortlessly pass other cars on major highways at 140 KM/H or more, and acceleration is better than any car I've owned, with smooth gear changes from the 4-speed automatic transmission. The dual exhaust has sort of a throaty sound, which could be interpreted as noisy, but I think it's sporty, and I like it. The throaty growl of the 214 horsepower is enough to provide the inspiration of a Mustang V8...really, it sounds that good! At around 6000 RPM it just sings. And not only is it an automotive symphony to listen to, it puts you back in your seat when you request as well. Highway merging, onramps and passing are effortless, even fun. But for people buying this car for comfort and luxury more than power, read on, as you will see the Concorde is more than just a sports sedan. 
      The brake pedal on our car seems to require quite a bit of pressure to get a reaction, but it doesn't really bother me. I would like a bit more feedback, but it is not a large matter. The steering feels great, and it is easy to place the car on the road. It is somewhat weighted at higher speeds and gives a confident feel, yet light at slow speeds for easy parking and maneuverability in tight spots. As far as repairs, a few have come up since I initially wrote this review about 8 months ago, like a clunky rear suspension and a squeak in the rear wheels, but I don't think that should be hard to clear up. Mechanically this car has cost next to nothing, other than regular maintenance. Good job Chrysler!  
    The brakes are powerful, and although sometimes harsh under heavy braking, the ABS system brings you to a controlled stop in short time. 

   ON THE ROAD

      Visibility is the best I have experienced so far. Easy to see past the C-pillar (large metal plates that connect the back of the roof to the trunk behind the rear doors) are easy to see past for shoulder checks and parallel parking. Nice. One thing I notice odd is the slope of the windows in the car. Very big windshield, and it can take some getting used to, but over time it is easy to get accustomed to. 
   The car is very comfortable. The power leather seats are a dream - still comfortable after 6 hour drives. 8-way power seats offer a great driving position for nearly everyone, but no memory on the seats. Lumbar is nice, but only on the drivers side (too bad, but no biggie). The seats are contoured perfectly and offer lots of support. The climate control is okay...just okay. Sometimes it takes a long time to figure out where it's at, and does not start the fan for quite a while. But that can be altered with the simple twist of the fan button. The original tires were good, but now that I have replaced them with MotoMaster Touring LXR tires, the grip is not quite the same, but the quietness is superb. It feels like a cloud on highway and city streets, and nary a sound enters the interior unless on quite rough pavement, dirt roads or deep potholes. A very nice, smooth ride overall. I did not expect this of a Concorde - try it out and see for yourself! I think you will be impressed (unless you just came from a Lexus dealer). 
    One gripe I have is headlight power. I strongly recommend aftermarket fog lights if buying this car. High beams are good for distance and clarity, but the low beams do not offer nearly enough coverage or brightness on the road. At high speeds in the rain, it can get pretty scary when all you can see is a vague outline of the yellow lines. Trust me, you want fog lights (or some other light upgrade) if you get this car. 

   EXTERIOR

  Beautiful lines. It looks aggressive more than anything in my opinion. The lights and grille are sunk low, the hood has a fairly deep rake, the windshield is low, and the back raised a little. Big 16" aluminum wheels and nice tires top it off. Ours is in black, which makes it look 100 times sportier (and luxurious when clean [ha!])in my opinion. It is a very attractive car, and still outshines lots of the other cars on the road today. The full rear light that extends the entire of the back of the car is nice too. Dual exhaust is attractive. Just a nice looking car!

   INTERIOR

 A cavernous interior with a seemingly bottomless trunk. Convenience is top notch with quite a bit of storage space. I wish the used Concorde I got had the 5-passenger floor shift arrangement with autostick, but I will have to survive with the 6-passenger setup. It is a good setup with a little wider seats and separate armrests that move with the seat backs, but I would have preferred the storage of the console, sportiness of the floor shift semi-auto, and the complete look of the dash. However, every control is in a good spot to reach, and it is clean, uncluttered and very warm. 
    Another thing I wish I this car had is the optional power sunroof. That would have been icing on the cake. The sound system is good, but clarity could be better out of the rear speakers. It's mostly all bass out of those, with the mids and highs coming out of the front speakers. Convenience is great, and the best is room. This car is huge! I can pack 3 six footers in back without complaint, but only two should go in the front, unless the third is very small. Again, the 5-passenger setup is better. Leg room, head room, hip room, shoulder room...its all good. I am 6'2 and my head is quite a ways from the roof of the car. Front and back. That cannot be said for the redesigned Concorde. 
  No rattles or squeaks, and everything is in a convenient, ergonomic position in relation to the driver. Just a pleasant place to be!
   My uncle drives a 2000 Buick LeSabre (loaded) and I like my '97 Concorde much better. More comfortable, much sportier, and I just like the way it looks and feels better.

    OVERALL

I think anybody looking for a large family car to comfortably seat 5, but want's the performance and handling of a 2-door coupe, this is the car for you. Also good for people that travel long distances, or spend lots of time on the road. This car is NOT good for pure driving enthusiasts that should be driving a BMW or Viper, or those in search of sublime luxury, who should be driving a Rolls-Royce. Great all around car for everybody else.
