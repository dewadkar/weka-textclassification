            In 1998 My husband and I decided to go out and get a second car, and after a week of dealing with the sharks at different dealerships we came across a little dealer with a gold/bronze colored 1993 Dodge Intrepid.  We test drove the car, and fell in love with it immediately.  We bought it that morning.  At $9,000 (remember it was 1998) it was the most expensive and nicest car we had ever owned.  

I am not going to say that the car never had any problems. but I think that some of the people that have also reviewed this car tend to go a bit overboard.  Any make and model of car can produce Lemons, and it is unfortunate that those people bought one.  The problems we had with our Intrepid while we owned it were: turn signal switch broke when it got caught on my very large coat during one cold winter day.  Water pump went out once, and the window stopped working properly, which was a cinch for our mechanic to repair with no new parts needed.  

We owned the car from 60,000 miles to 136,000 mile and were planning on keeping it for several more years.  Unfortunately a person decided to make a left turn from on coming traffic in front of my husband and totaled our car.  It was a total loss and we only got $3000.00 for it.  The biggest complaint that I have for my car was that it depreciated in value so fast.

With the proper maintenance and care these can be great cars.  We truly loved ours and were not ready to part with it.  After much search, we have decided to get another Intrepid to replace the one we lost.  After we have owned it for a while I will review our new 2001 Chrysler Intrepid.
