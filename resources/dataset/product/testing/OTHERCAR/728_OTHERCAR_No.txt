            I bought my 1997 RS Eclipes at 37,000 miles. The car is bright red and i added 17 inch rims to it, and tinted window.  I do not recommend changing the rims of this car any bigger then the manufacter says. The car may look fast but a Honda Accord could destroy it.  When some other person looks at me at a stop light and i can tell he wants to race me i pertend not to see him.  The car itself looks very sporty and peppy but the fact of the matter is for the price you pay for this car you could get a much better deal on a more well rounded car.  the 1997-1999 all look the same except for a minor difference under the door but it is a really small difference.  The car is very bad in the snow and on curves, i do not recommend going past 30 on a turn off the highway.
It's very hard to see out of the back window and the seats are not made for sleeping, if you go on a vacation you better have money to pay for a hotel, because not only are the seats uncomfortible but since it is a very sporty car everyone tends to look at it. The paint has alot of layers, but don't dare leaning on the car, the car dents very easily.  The glove compartment shakes when you go over a bump and the controls are not very easy to get to.  The car has two cup holders but i don't recommend using the one closer to the radio for quarters, and dimes, it breaks very easly. Now since the car is low it is very easy to scrape the bottom of the car while parking, or leaving a gas station to get on the main road.  Chicks dig the car, for some reason everyone thinks i paid more for it.  
The car is mean for a college kid or high school, not for really long distances and not really for ruff rider. Another thing is when i drive the car up hill it does not go as fast as the other cars, it revs up but does not want to get into the next gear, i recommend using the Low gear for uphill, all and all you get what you pay for, just be careful cause it's not exactly a Toyota
