            Import buyers beware!  The Dodge Neon R/T is back.  This time, with a few tricks up it's sleeve.  To start things off, the new High-Output Magnum(R) engine screams "DON'T STOP!" when you mash down on the accelerator.  While the traction control is turned off, the tires squeal in delight.  With the tach reading 6,500 RPM, the clutch goes down, along with the shifter, to second gear.  A quick pop of the clutch and back to the floor with the gas gives you one last chirp from the tires as you spin the tach around yet again to the red-zone.  After a quick shove to third gear you're all ready at 60 miles per hour.  Heck, it's only been 8 seconds!  ARE YOU SERIOUS!  You bet!  And with 150 horses running full steam ahead, the speedometer continues to climb.  That's Neon R/T.  And believe you me, that's only the beginning.

With tons of features and a reasonable price, this pocket-rocket is a great deal.  For starters, the new High-Output 2.0-liter SOHC Magnum(R) engine is an absolute joy to rev.  Engine noise is somewhat pronounced at any RPM over 3,500, but hey, did you buy this car to sleep in?  HELL NO!!!  The dual exhaust crackles like thunder at your command.  The 5-speed tranny is slick and smooth.  The only draw back is that the shifter is too big and bulky.  Seating up front is good even for a six foot tall guy like myself.  My friends being of the same height seem a little cramped in the back.  The six-speaker stereo with available four-disc CD changer rocks!  Bass response is great.  It wouldn't hurt though to throw a sub in the trunk.  And don't try to change a CD while driving either.  The changer is tucked out of the way under the dash.  The sporty off-white faced gauges with blue-green illumination look cool in the day and even sexier at night, but in the evening hours you need "Go Go Gadget Eyes" to even begin to see how fast you are going.  Suspension has been upgraded for your driving enjoyment.  Try to steer clear of potholes and train tracks though as the stiffer shocks send chills up your spine.  Speaking of chills, the air conditioner is colder than your grocerï¿½s freezer.  There are tons of little "cubby holes" everywhere to put things, although the space in front of the CD changer frustrates the hell out of me.  My big hands barely touch one of the buttons and a CD promptly appears.  DAMN!  The keyless entry system SHOULD be a convenience considering it is in the 'Driver Convenience Group' right?  WRONG!  Half the time I'm right on top of the damn car and it still doesn't work.  New remote is on the way.  Power windows up front are nice, but what is up with the rollers in the back?  My shoulder still hurts from the reach.  Another complaint I have about the windows is when it rains, IT POURS!  Even with the windows open a quarter of an inch, water still finds its way onto my arm.  That was quickly fixed with a set of window visors.  My favorite feature is actually a few features in one, the 'Motorsports Package'.  Basically, this contains black rims, yellow lettered Goodyear tires, and some nice decals.  Also, upon purchase, you get a Motorsports track bag filled with Mopar goodies.

Enough can't be said for this little wonder on wheels.  Dodge has walked the walk and talked the talk.  So get in, sit down, shut up, and hang on.
