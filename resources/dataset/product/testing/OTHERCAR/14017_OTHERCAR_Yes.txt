                  While the 1998 Chevy Cavalier Z24 has the same drivetrain as the Pontiac Sunfire GT, you can undoubtedly tell the difference in quality. The Cavalier seems much more cheap on the inside, the Sunfire also has much bolder styling to boot. The Sunfire GT for 1998 was one of the most hotly cars in the entry level coupe segment, and even today looks very modern in design.


<i>Driving Impressions:</i> 

  For 1998 the Sunfire came in 4 different trim lines, the SE 2 door coupe, the SE 4 door, the SE 2 door convertible, and finally the GT <b>performance</b> model which boasts a standard 2.4 liter, 150 horsepower DOHC engine. Although not the fastest car in its class, the sweet 2.4 liter, rev happy, twin-cam four cylinder, coupled with a five speed manual transmission (3 and 4-speed automatics are options) gives peppy acceleration through the rev range. Although the other trim lines come standard with a 2.2 liter 115 horsepower 4-cylinder, the 150 horses in the Sunfire GT, enables light work of hill climbing and gives plenty of passing power. Even in 5th gear there is enough power on tap for you to climb the steepest inclines if at 65 MPH  . The Sunfire GT is sporty, but is also a very good cruiser. While cruising between 65-75 MPH, the driver and passengers are in a semi hushed environment, while not being outright quiet, this car offers some smooth cruising. Handling is another one of the Sunfire's strong attributes. With a sport-tuned suspension, and a stiff structure roadholding is excellent, and torque steer is hardly noticeable. With sharp responsive turn-in, and grippy tires, the Sunfire GT reinforces Pointiac's slogan of 'driving excitement.' Braking is very good, 4-wheel ABS is standard. 

<b>NOTE:</b> expect around 33 MPG with the 5-speed, and 29 MPG with the automatic. I receive about 34 MPG while on the freeway.  


  All 1998 Pontiac Sunfire's have a stiff unitary <b> chassis</b>, with a Macpherson-strut front <b>suspension</b> and a twist beam rear axle. The GT comes with a sport suspension, which has thicker anti roll bars, and more aggressive steering.   

  <b>About the engine</b> General Motors have kinda copied import rivals by equipping its small J-body subcompacts with dual overhead cam engines. The 2.4 liter found in the Sunfire GT (and is also an expensive option on the other trim lines, besides the SE 2 door coupe) is an undersqaure design, it produces a respectable 150 horsepower at 6,000 rpm, and a healthy 155lb-ft of torque at 4,400 RPM. The girth of this engine gives smoothness, and better power delivery than the base engine. 

<i>Interior Accommodation:</i> 

  The <b>Interior</b> of the 1998 Sunfire GT, while not refined as some, is still quite accommodating. My test GT came with AC, cruise control, power everything, and a center console. Dual air bags were standard. The 1998 Sunfire GT is essentially a 2 2 coupe with small back seats. But this doesn't mean that this Pontiac was not well laid out, there is excellent front leg room, plenty of head room, and the front seats were very comfortable and supportive. The rear passengers may feel a bit claustrophobic, but this is what you would expect from a car in this class. 

<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

 The <b>Exterior</b> is quite dramatic. Launched in 1995, the Sunfire bears a strong resemblance to its larger V8 powered big sister; the Firebird. The dramatic styling of the Sunfire has aged very well over the years. For 1999 the design was updated. The 1998 Sunfire GT has semi flush mounted headlights, personally I believe Pontiac could have done a much better job with the front fascia of this car, but it still is quite aggressive looking. Fog lights add that extra sporty touch. The taillight treatment on the Sunfire GT is dramatic but well integrated. The design team did a great job with this cars styling.  

 <b>Price and Reliability</b> Even in 1998 this car was a steal at only $16,000 fully equipped. today these Sunfires can be had for almost half this price. My test 1998, A car in the paper sold by its owner, was only $7,000, it did have 86,000 miles on it, but I hear that these engines, transmissions, and suspension components last quite some time after 100,000 miles. I'm really considering buying this car, (Update, I bought it)  It's available after Feb 6th, and will give me an upgrade to my current ownership of a 1994 Ford escort.. I'm so ready for this car!


<i>Conclusion:</i>

This has been a very reliable car for me. I enjoy driving my <a href="/content_67725856388">  1991 Geo Storm</a> much more, however this car is a blast to drive, and proves to be comfy on long trips. I recommend the 1998 Pontiac Sunfire to anyone looking for an economical yet quick small car on the used car market.


-Happy Car Shopping!
