            A couple of weeks ago I got into an accident.  Luckily I was in a Cherokee Sport.  That alone tells you that this car is safe. I mean I didnt get into a major accident but I have to tell you that I walked out of that car with one scratch which is not even significant enough to talk about. Thank god I did my research because I would have been in the hospital by now.  As a sworn witness this car is safe. (Of course at reasonable speeds).               
     This car is safe as well as fun to drive.  Fun meaning it is comfortable and drives very well.  It takes turns like butter( if they're not sharp) and the brakes are awesome.  They are really sharp.  They really handle well in bad weather and that is always important.
     My advice before purchasing this car is that you need to make sure that you get ABS brakes and full time four wheel drive.  This combination will probably make you safer on the road.  But that dosen't mean that you should become a speed deamon.  you can still get seriously injured if you crash at high speeds.  But of course all of you experienced drivers know that.  I really do recommend this car for parents who want their kids who are new drivers to be safe, and for adults who want to be safe themselves.
