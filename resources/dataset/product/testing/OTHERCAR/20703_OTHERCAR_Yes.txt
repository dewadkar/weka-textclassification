            This is one tough truck! 
 
I have never owned a 'brand new' vehicle until now. We did not enter into the new vehicle market blindly. We test drove every major manufacturer's comparable truck  before settling on the Silverado. 

We have had this Chevrolet 2500HD 4WD Silverado Extended Cab for about six weeks and have hauled a huge fifth wheel three horse trailer with it, a smaller bumper tow trailer, and used it to go on a  few longer road trips as well. I must say, as the owner of an older 89 Chevy truck, I found this new truck to be a pure driving pleasure. It rides so smoothly you'd swear you were in a car. 

The interior is luscious by truck standards, the sound system (we have the Bose optional sound system) is divine. We both love great music. 
Can we HEAR it over that big powerhouse diesel?

YES!!!!! 

This is the quietest running diesel I know of. I have a friend with a new F-350 Diesel; we know when she starts that truck - and we live a half a mile away. 

As I said, we test drove a lot of trucks before settling on the Chevy Silverado 2500HD diesel. None compare to the quality and no one could touch the tow package that comes standard on the Duramax diesel/Allison transmission combination. It incorporates a wonderful Tow/Haul feature that you engage on the shift lever; you push a button to activate the feature and the truck sensors adapt the Allison transmission's shifting to accommodate towing; better still.... if you touch the brake going down a hill, the Allison in Tow/Haul mode downshifts smoothly to slow your speed as you go down the grade, saving wear and tear on your truck and trailer braking systems. 

We haul a 9000+ lb eight foot wide gooseneck horse trailer that is 24 feet long. Loaded we are talking 12-15000 lbs.
The truck manages to move that trailer so efficiently that we almost forget that we're hauling a trailer. You do not notice the dramatic drag and drop in power on grades that I had with my older manual transmission Chevy (also a 2500HD; but gas powered 350).

Tons of passenger room in the rear seat. Rear seat folds up out of the way in one simple move if you need to put packages in the back seat area. Back seat is also completely removeable. 

All seats are well padded and well designed with comfort in mind. Lots of leg room. My husband is tall - he loves to drive the truck when he can get it away from me!

Lots of great space to store items and our emergency kit and tool box fit under the back seat allowing maximum passenger comfort. Not every brand had this kind of space designed into their trucks.

The Chevy Silverado is visually appealing as well. It sports a modern exterior design and it still looks like a truck. 

GREAT fuel economy. We calculated 18.5 mpg on the highway (not hauling) in a 350 truck! Loaded mileage based on the above mentioned large horse trailer is about 13.5 mpg. Still better than my old gas 350 at 9 mpg (no load). 

Top that. 
 
Chevrolet can take pride in a job well done. 

We were fortunate to be able to get this truck during a major sale with manufacture rebates and dealer incentives. This truck retails for (window sticker) $42,950.00 (US) Remember, it is a diesel that adds about 6000. to the base price, and it has 4WD, another upgrade from a base unit. 
It comes with a 3 yr. warranty and 100,000 miles for engine.
  
Test drive one and you'll see this truck sells itself. That cemented the deal for us.
