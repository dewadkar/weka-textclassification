            I bought this car in August of 2000, after rave reviews from other customers.  I test drove many other cars in the same class, but chose the A4 because of "customer service promise."  The car had faulty speakers, spark plugs, stereo, heating system and massive electrical problems.  In addition, it surges in acceleration intermittently.  Driving to Arizona from Los Angeles, the car shook uncontrollably (with no warning lights) and broke down (still less than 10,000 miles and had been tuned up by Audi two days before).  Audi's great customer service left me stranded in 115 degree heat on a sidewalk with no alternate transportation or attempt to see if I was in a safe place.  My car was towed to a city three hours from my home and I was told that they would get to it in a month.  Finally, when I got it towed back to LA, it was fixed, only to have the problems repeat in three months.  This is the worst car I have ever owned.  I feel safer on a bike riding in the wrong direction on the highway.
