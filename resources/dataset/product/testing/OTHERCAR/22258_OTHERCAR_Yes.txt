            The old v70 was a great car.  Great to drive, room for a small army, good interior.  However there was one thing lacking, Volvo still hadn't slain there boring image.  Now I think at last they have.  This car will be a hit as it beats it's BMW and Mercedes competitors on everything except image, and even here the gap is closing.
The 2.4T is a superb drive, so quick, so sure footed.  Of course Volvos exceptional safety standards remain in tact.  The usual sips, seat-belt technology, and tank like construction are all present.
However it is the design which is a real winner.  A significant improvement on those which have gone before.
Inside it is well equipped, incredibly spacious (of course), and well designed.
A definite recommendation who would prefer practicality and a great drive to a flashy image.<br><br>
