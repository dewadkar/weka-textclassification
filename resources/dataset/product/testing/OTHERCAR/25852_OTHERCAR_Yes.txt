            I love my jeep, we live back a long lane, its not in very good shape and everyone complains about driving down it, well my jeep drives down with no problem at all. we live where the weather isn't very nice, everyone is stuck on the hill, I put it in 4 wheel and drive right up. I recommend this for people who lives where there is bad weather and live out in the country.living in the country we find it a  a must to have a jeep.I don't like to drive in the snow but with my jeep I don't know why I worry about it, hubby doesn't.  we  will buy another one. <br><br>
