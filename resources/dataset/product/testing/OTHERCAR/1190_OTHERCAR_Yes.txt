            I've been driving my Neon for about a year, and it has not given me that many problems. It's easy to handle and its small size is very easy for an inexperienced driver to handle. 

I think that it is the perfect car for a teenager and even though it is not the fastest car, it has a decent acceleration. It has a cute look to it, and runs smoothly also. Even though it is a compact car, it is still very roomy inside and you can fit three or four people in the backseat.

The car is very gas-efficient, and one full tank (that isn't even that expensive) can last me for as long as up to two weeks. I would definitely recommend this car; it is a good all-around vehicle for a beginning driver.
