            I purchased an Isuzu Trooper about a year ago after my wife and I had our first child.  We decided not to go down the mini-van route and try to stay a little bit 'hip' with the times.  We looked at several other sport utility trucks basing our search criteria on cubic space for the best money.  After looking for about 2 months, Isuzu ran a lease special that made it to good to refuse.  We were able to get the Isuzu Trooper for the same price as a lot of sub-sport utilities.  

I love to drive this truck because I have yet to find something it won't do.  The push button four wheel drive makes it great in snow and slush without having to burn all that extra fuel for full-time four wheel drive.  And on the fuel consumption topic, for a v-6 engine it gets surprisingly good gas mileage.  We have put 12,000 miles on the truck in just under a year and average about 70 dollars in gas a month.  

Now let's talk about the roominess of the vehicle.  The Trooper can easily fit 3, yes 3, car seats in back seat, and you still have the large cargo capacity in the back of the truck.  You can fold the back seats down to even make more hauling capacity.  If the truck did have on draw back it would be the rear door access.  To access the rear there is one large door and one small door. Both swing out towards the side of the truck.  When the large door is fully open it locks in place.  This is a good safety feature if you are parked on a hill, but those of us who do not make a habit of offloading large equipment don't appreciate this feature.  It forces you to unload the rear and then place whatever you are carrying on the ground so you can release the locking mechanism.

Bottom line; this is a great truck for the money.  You can certainly get nicer truck with more amenities, but if you want size for a growing family at a reasonable price than this is the truck for you.<br><br>
