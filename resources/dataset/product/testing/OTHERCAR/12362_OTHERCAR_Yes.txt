            Since our regular old Taurus station wagon couldn't handle the drive up to Vermont this winter, we rented a Mercury Sable.  I must say I was quite impressed.  Then again, it maybe just that I haven't ridden in a nice, new, clean car in about a decade.  But this car was mine (for the weekend) and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was relatively quiet and had a nice stereo system.  The brakes took a while to get used to because they were a bit jerky.  There was plenty of leg room and the trunk was huge!  We were able to fit all our bags and my sister's trombone in it.  Personally, I think it is a rather unattractive model.  It's a bit too bubble shaped for me but I think the comfort factor cancels that one.  It was only a sedan but I didn't have any problems riding in it for 5 hours.<br><br>
