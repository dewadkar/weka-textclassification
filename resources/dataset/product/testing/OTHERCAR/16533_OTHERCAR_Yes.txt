               I was the last person you would expect to drive a VW. I am a very large guy and my mentality was dead set on American muscle cars I had a 1989 Ford Mustang 5.0 in my mind if it wasn't an American car it was worthless. I quickly changed my mind after commuting it for one week. Every day after work instead of going home and relaxing I had to work on my car because it either wasn't running right or something had broke, not to mention $70 a week in gas didn't help either. Finally I had enough,and decided to trade in the piece of s--t.
   I saw a 1996 VW Jetta GL in my price range. I was hesitant but figured   it can't  be any worst than what I already was driving. The minute I sat in it I knew that I wanted to buy it. The first thing that amazed is that I had plenty of room in it despite its small exterior. I loved everything on the car.
   Let's start with the engine.Mine had 2.0 4-cylinder, not that bad on power but nothing to write home about. The toque came on very low in the rpm range which helps when you only have 115 hp. I was very easily able to keep up with 130 hp Honda's due to their lack of toque. I also experienced something that I never had before GOOD GAS MILEAGE, not to mention a reliable car.  
   In stock trim with 14&quot; wheel's with 65 series tires and drum rear brakes my Jetta was already out handling my supposed sports car Mustang. Let me tell you,if you want to make a Jetta look great lower it and put 17&quot; wheels on it not only did it look great it handled amazing. I actually beat a Mustang 5.0 on a windy road even with the severe lack of power.MUSTANG'S HANDLE LIKE S--T!!! I beat the hell out of my Jetta everyday and I never had one problem,not a one. The car rides great and runs quiet even on the freeway. They are very comfortable as well. I had made several trip to L.A. in this car (nearly 800 miles round trip) and was comfy the whole time.
   If you own a Jetta or if you are thinking about buying one run synthetic oil in it. The car will love you for it and you will notice a power difference. I was able to beat Honda prelude SI's just with that small difference. When you buy a VW you enter into a family in a way.It is not uncommon to have a fellow VW owner wave as you pass by or even flag you down to talk about your cars. I don't know of any other car company that has this kind of brotherhood.
   I was surprised to see people write bad reviews on this car, and it's  not like I don't have any car knowledge. I have several friends with VW's and not one of them has ever had a problem with their cars. Thanks to VW's I will never make the American muscle car mistake again, unless I have a reliable second car such as a Jetta. I would still own it today if it didn't get stolen. So I ran down to the VW dealership and bought a Passat. I am now planning on buying my fourth VW (a Corrado) for now on I will never be without a VW.<br><br>
