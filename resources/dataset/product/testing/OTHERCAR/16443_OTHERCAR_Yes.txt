            I will tell you the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth!!!    I promise

I have had my Fuji Finepix 2400 for about 6 months now, and I haven't had one problem, NOT ONE.

It was one of my larger purchases, but I must say, it was a smart one.
I love the camera because it comes with 
the zoom that no one can live without, 
a reasonable choice of picture size (on the camera, you can fine-tune with the software bundle they included)
A SLIDING LENS COVER ---- I felt this was really important at the time I bought my camera, because I didn't want to scratch the lens by accident sometime, so i chose the Fuji finepix 2400 over the 1400(which has no cover)

The price was reasonable at the time of my purchase, about $500 (which included a $100 mail in rebate)
and the price has dropped accordingly over the time passed.

If you want a camera that will stand up to anything, and is super easy to use (for the beginner),
gives some functions that advanced users are looking for,
then this is a  great choice, it was my first choice after about a month of watching prices and looking at stats.

My advice to you is that if this looks like it could work for you, then it will.   But if you come across any other review of another camera that is BETTER, then look into it a bit more.
And if you like what you see, then i say go for it.

Oh ,
If you want to get the most out of the camera, I suggest buying a Q2 quest charger, with NiMH batteries, it charges them in less then 3 hours if the batteries are not TOTALLY dead, if they are TOTALLY dead (though I have never gotten this to happen) it supposedly takes about an hour to two hours more to charge them over the norm 3 hrs.
they haven't failed me yet, and I don't think they ever will.


SO.....
GO FOR IT!!  But if you find a better camera, look into it, and if its still better, then get that one. This is an older camera and technology advances at a great rate, so go with something newer if you find something solid and reliable.  
Good luck with your purchases and happy shopping!
