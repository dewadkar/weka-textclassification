            Capitalizing on the recent success of convertible sports cars, Mitsubishi released a topless version of its successful pocket rocket in the spring of 1996. Unlike most convertibles, the Spyder is not merely a chopped version of the Eclipse coupe. Instead, it was designed from square one to be a convertible. This results in a drop-top that is extremely rigid with only a 50-pound weight gain over its hardtop sibling. 
The Eclipse Spyder has attractive look-at-me styling that is a good component of any convertible design. Fine interior ergonomics and an excellent driving position compliment the sleek, compact body and tidy dimensions of the car. 

Here are some things to look at before buying.

#1 The Looks. If this car were a boxer it would be Ali, It�s pretty. The rounded looks and low wide stance makes this car look mean and lean. Many different paint jobs are available to satisfy many different styles. I prefer the apple red, with a tan top. CAUTION: I assume to keep sleek looks; the bumpers on this car are painted. The slightest touch can result in a scratch so be careful when you�re parking.

#2 Standard equipment. 4 cyl 2.4 L Engine, 5-Speed Transmission, AM/FM Compact Disc Player, Air Conditioning, Aluminum/Alloy Wheels, Center Console, Dual Air Bag Restraints, Intermittent Wipers, Power Antenna, Power Brakes, Power Convertible Top, Power Door Locks, Power Steering, Power Windows, Rear Window Defroster, Remote Trunk Release, Tachometer, Tilt Steering Wheel, Tonneau Cover, Velour/Cloth Seats.

#3 Interior. It a bit cramped for me. 5�10 and 180 isn�t what I consider a big guy, but I find I could use some more headroom. Legroom is ample for the driver and passenger. The back seat is a joke. You can carry a suitcase, a pack of CD�s and a collapsible chair. Legroom in the back is non-existent unless the front seats are filled with people under 5 foot.

#4 Driving. This car is a blast to drive. It is fast, corners well and the driving position is very comfortable. The GS, the entry-level version has more than enough power for most people. When the top comes down, which only takes about 8 seconds, you really get all the exhilaration of driving a convertible. Visibility with the top up can be difficult. A small rear widow and a low ceiling make seeing behind you hard. 

#5 Price. You looking at 25k for a brand new one, but since the new models are out you can�t find a new one. Insurance is going to be fairly high too. The insurance companies know if you drive a car like this you probably like to have fun, and they hate that. 

#6 Tune it up. The eclipse is a popular car to fix up to make faster. Because of this the companies that make high performance parts make many for the eclipse. HID lights, better airflow systems, bolt-on engine parts, NOS kits etc.

#7. Practical. No it isn�t. This car isn�t perfect for families, there is no room for 4 kids and a bag of soccer balls. It isn�t for the struggling college student, it�s expensive and has high insurance rates. But it is fun. It is great for the single gal or guy who wants people to look at them and likes the convertible feature. 

Have fun, and good driving.
