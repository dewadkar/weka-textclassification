            This car gets more attention than most cars - both positive and negative. It seems to be either people love or hate it, with no in between. I don't feel it's necessary to list all its available options in this review. That, you, the purchaser should do - either through the Chrysler website, or at your local dealer.

One thing I do with ANY purchase, and even moreso when I'm spending thousands, is do my research, and that I did before I purchased the PT Cruiser.

For me, it was love at first SIGHT, when this car was first introduced to the world. At that time, I wasn't in the market for a car, but I always looked and admired when a PT Cruiser drove by. It received the most style points (to me) that I had given any car.

Then in February, 2002, it was time to replace the minivan, so it was time to do my homework. I looked at the PT Cruiser 1st because of its looks, and then looked at its functionality. For me, performance was never at the top of the list. So I knew with its 4-cylinder, 150-HP engine, I would not win any races with it (something I could care less about anyways). Also - I've always driven an automatic transmission, so shifting was not an option. In comparing it to the 1995 Mercury Villager 6-cylinder minivan it was replacing, it is much peppier - less engine, but less weight. As far as features, the Dream Cruiser we have is a "special edition" - a PT Cruiser Limited with the special Inca Gold color, a special numbered badge, and all the goodies included (not optional - things you would pick and choose from if ordering a limited). It has all the creature comforts you would want from a car - power windows, ABS brakes, sunroof, rear wiper, heated leather seats, AM/FM with single-CD, cruise control, etc.

The rear seats can be folded down in many ways, providing all kinds of different storage capabilities. It is also a small car that acts big. I have plenty of head and leg room while driving, and my friend, who is 6'5" and close to 400-lbs, thought he had more room than his 1989 Town Car.

As with any car - you may wonder why something is missing or could be better. For me, I wonder why something as simple as a glove-box light is missing. It also doesn't have an underhood light. I didn't even notice those things until after I had the car, but that would of made no difference. Also, I was a bit surprised that for it's small size, the gas mileage was not what I expected. In the first 1,000 miles during break-in, I was averaging 16-19MPG. Now, with over 2,000 miles on the car, it averages from 22-25MPG: not pure economy, but not horrible either.

Once you have the car, you may get the "itch" to modify it as I did, and there are many vendors that specialize in PT Cruisers that provide all kinds of goodies - performance enhancing, inside/outside vinyl, etc. I've added windshield logos, strut bar to give it a slightly better feel (IMO), and other things. You can lower the car, and make this car almost anything you want it to be. That's where the fun is. Whether you do nothing, or go hog wild, it's a blast. And, clubs are around that gets PT owners together. I am a member of the PTOC (PT Owners Club), and have met many wonderful PT Cruiser owners.

It has its limitations - obviously, the engine as mentioned above. Also - total gross vehicle capacity with passengers is around 850lbs. It can tow up to 1000 lb trailer. It doesn't have the storage space of a station wagon when all the seats are in use - but if there are only a driver and a passenger, the rear seats can be adjusted to carry many things.

SUMMARY
Each person has a reason to buy a car. For one, it should make you feel good. You need to consider your performance wants and needs - even though it LOOKS like it should be a speed demon, it isn't. It's more for show and practical driving. It holds a family of 4 comfortably. Go to the website or your dealer - look at the interior space and available options.
Know what you want before buying a car and spending many thousands of dollars. This car works as a family car, a fun to drive car, and an everyday car. It's not for racing, or to be used as a workhorse.

NOTES
1. I gave quality and craftsmanship a 5 - it seems like a solid car, but that choice only says dead quiet ride. It doesn't ride like a luxury car - but it is made solid.
2. Seat comfort - the Dream Cruiser only comes with leather seats. These are the 1st leather seats I've ever had. I'm used to the "softer" feel of cloth.
3. Reliability - personally, I haven;t had the car long enough. BUT - grab the most recent Consumer Reports auto guide. The PT Cruiser was one of only 3 cars that received all high marks.
4. Price Compare - there are still dealers that play games with pricing. I found this especially evident with the Dream Cruiser, it being a "special" limited edition automobile. Mine was purchased for $300 under MSRP, but a dealer only 20 miles down the road had a Dream Cruiser with a $5,000 mark-up. Just be careful - know your dealer.
5. Test Drive, Test Drive, Test Drive : sounds too stupid to say, but don't just get it because of its looks - drive the car, get on a highway. Test its acceleration, braking, and cornering ability. Be sure its a "feel" you can live with.
