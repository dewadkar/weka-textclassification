            I rented a 2000 Malibu when my old Saturn was totaled.  I was very impressed!

It was large inside and reminded me a lot of the Toyota Camry, but it costs about $8000 less!

It's comfortable and has all the features you could want.

The ride is smooth, the engine quiet yet powerful.  And there is a very roomy trunk!

It fits me, my 6'3" tall husband, and out 2 kids in car seats with room to spare.

The stereo system is nice, and I like the dash mounted ignition.

If you are looking for a flashy, sexy, or sporty car, the Malibu is not for you.  But if you are looking for something dependable and practical, this is it!

I did some research.  The 2001 Malibu was rated 'highly recomended' by Consumer Reports.  And the Edmunds.com car web site also gave it rave reviews.


I really wish it got better gas milage, but it seems to be about average for its class.

In conclusion, it is comperable to a Camry or Accord, and costs thousands less.

I was so impressed with my rented 2000 Malibu that I went out and bought a brand new 2001 Malibu!
