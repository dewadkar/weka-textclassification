            Ok, so I find myself in need of a dependable new car.  Since my champagne taste often conflicts with my beer budget I do some research and find that not only is the Honda Prelude a very well known, reputable car, it is definately something to make a head spin to be seen in.  When I first saw it on the lot (in 1997) I thought, wow!  a sporty car like that in such great shape?  Must have been owned by someone who did not drive it that much.  To the contrary, there were 120,000 miles already on it in 5 years.  So I'm thinking it will probably run like a dog.  Well, here I was very wrong.  When I first stepped on the gas I was experiencing an inner g-force that I hadnt quite had in previous rides.  So the car is looking good, in my price-range and from all reviews going to last me another 5 years of my typical 15,000 mile a year driving habits.  After the third month, I walk out to my car in the morning and all the lights are blinking and flashing - both interior and exterior.  I'm thinking - did someone break in?  The cars electric circuits had somehow melted during the night.  Well, ok, that is freaky, maybe I left the radio on or something.  From that electrical replacement on it was one thing after another breaking on this car (purchased from a dealership who did a "thorough check" of all its components).  Mostly it was the ignition chip, which I replaced 3 times, or the timing belt which in 40,000 of my own miles had to be replaced twice (I had confirmed with the dealership where I had purchased it that the timing belt had been replaced at the time they took it in trade and it should last 60,000 miles on that car).  In the end, 3.5 years and 40,000 miles later I had sunk over $5,000 in repairs and occasionally the car would not start.  Every time it would mysteriously not start all I could think of was handing over my next two paychecks.
