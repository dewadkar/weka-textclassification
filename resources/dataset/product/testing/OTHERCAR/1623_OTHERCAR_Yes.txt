            As the former owner of the shoebox sized Geo Metro, I was ready to upsize when it came time to buy a new car.  I did my research, and found my good Geo/Chevrolet experience wasn't unique.  Top consumer magazines had rated the Prizm an excellent value and all around reliable car.  I purchased my Prizm new in 1997, and haven't had a moment's trouble with it.  It gets exceptional gas mileage - I tend to push it to the almost-empty mark, and can always go 320 - 335 miles since my last fill-up before I start getting nervous and looking for a gas station.  I've found it quite roomy for a &quot;compact&quot; car as well.  I look at other cars in the same price range and they seem very small and cramped, both inside and out, next to my Prizm.  Even my 6-foot father is comfortable sitting in the back seat behind 5'4&quot; me.  I consider it rather sporty for a 4-door sedan as well.  The black metallic finish I chose is sleek and stylish, the standard stereo/cassette has very good overall sound and, most importantly, the engine has quite a bit of pep with a 5-speed manual transmission.  In fact, I've frequently surprised passengers with the amount of power and speed I can coax from such a small engine.  All in all, I love my Prizm and will definitely consider another one for my next car purchase.<br><br>
