            In March of 1999 I had just moved and needed to find a good reliable car which I could use for the family and for commuting (90 minutes each way). I decided on the Saturn SL-2 because it was roomy and economical. 

My experience with Saturn was a pleasure right from the start, I walked into the showroom a bit apprehensive expecting the usual pressure type sales-people.  I was surprised by the casual dress and relaxed manner of all the staff in the room.  The salesman who greeted me was very low key and after offering me some coffee or a free soft-drink he listened to what I was looking for and began teaching me about Saturn.

These cars are truly the only American made automobile in the world today. Everything on the car was manufactured and assembled here in America by American workers.  They are built with standardized materials which makes repairing them cheaper and easier and they are built with safety as a very high priority.  I had some time before I would be taking delivery of the car, so I opted to have one built especially for me!

I chose the colors and options that I wanted and there was no haggling over the price, they do not raise the price of the cars expecting to bargain with a shopper it is fixed by the factory... in other words the price of an SL-2 is going to be the same no matter where you go.  There may be variations related to delivery costs and taxes but not the basic price.  When ever I called to check the status of my new car, they let me know at what stage of manufacturing it was at.

When the day came for me to take delivery, everything was ready for me.  It took just a few minutes to sign the papers, and my car was waiting for me there in the showroom all fresh and clean!  They took my picture before I drove away, and a few weeks later I received a calendar with my picture blown up on it!  I'm not impressed with hoaky gimmicks, but this corporation really seems to care about it's customers.

When I brought the car in for service, they were fast and respectful and they even washed the car for me...  I was told I can bring the car in for washing anytime I liked, for free!!!  There were only two problems that I had with the car-  first of all, the sunroof did not seat properly when I went to close it, they repaired it in about 20 minutes.  The only other problem was with the air-dam under the front of the car, I parked too close to the curb one day and the air-dam pulled loose that required a couple of clips to be replaced and away I went.

It is just a great car, and a great company.
