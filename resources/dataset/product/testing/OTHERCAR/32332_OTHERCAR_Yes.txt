            I bought this camera as a direct result of a review I saw on TV. I chose this camera because it can be used as digital camera to capture images or as a web cam to chat. You can also make short email videos. The price was also a major factor. I've had it about a month and so far have enjoyed it immensely. 

It is small and will fit in your pocket easily. It is easy to use. This camera will store 64 high quality pictures or 128 lower quality pictures. For still photos the camera automatically focuses. The software to download the pictures from the camera to the computer is easy to use and has worked very well. The pictures I took of my child to send to his grandparents have come out extremely clear and crisp. The video email messages are easy to make and have worked very well.

I love the size and ease of use of this camera. I recommend this camera to anyone who has never used a digital camera before, but would like to start with a versatile inexpensive camera.<br><br>
