            I wrestled for a month about this purchase and test-shot every equivalent camera.   First let me tell  you what I have concluded is important:

-How quick the camera is ready to shoot.  When you slide the lens cover on the 500z, you can see an image on the screen and take a shot in about half a second.   This is the most important thing about the camera----because it is, after all, for SNAPSHOTS, so when I see a great thing happening, I want to capture it instantly before the moment goes away.   The 500Z it utterly amazing in this capacity.

-How easily I can view and dispense with photos.  This is important because without the cost of film, i want to shoot ALOT, but not waste my time or computer hard drive space on a bunch of useless shots.  With the 500z, I press one button to see the photo and another to dispose it.  

-How easily I can learn and operate the controls.  Again, even at 5 megapixels, this isn't a professional camera, and I don't need a zillion settings and options. I just want to take the best picture possible quickly.  The 500z is totally instinctive.  You will never have to looka t the manual.   I'm sure that fanatics will want a few more dials and switches, but I am glad to see them missing.

-How sharp the images are.   5 mega pixels is a lot of pixels!  I am constantly amazed at how sharp and crisp the images are, even when I enlarge them to 8x10 and print them on my $69 printer.  Sure, fanatics can inspect these closely and gripe about something, but to anyone I've shown these to, they are amazed.

-Battery life seems to be the achilles heel of all digital cameras, but unless you are covering the olympics, the 500z battery is good for more pictures than you're likely to take in a day.  I have gotten 100 shots out of a battery, which suits me fine.

-time to shoot is excellent, with almost no lapse when you press the button.  And the most you ever wait for a second shot is a few seconds, often less.

Now, the 500z is not 100% perfect by any means, so let me tell you the bad news, in two areas:

-First, what you see is not what you get.  The image you see on the screen is always a little off, meaning if you center your subject, it's going to end up being slightly lower than center.  You learn to adjust for this in your head, but it seems ridiculous that such a problem exists.   I understand that most cameras share this flaw.  What is crazy is that the flaw is 100% reliable---so couldn't they have adjusted accordingly???

-Second, and this is very odd---the flash is TOO GOOD.  Everyone complains about how weak the flashes are on these tiny cameras, but on the 500z, if you are within 6 feet of your subject, you get too much exposure, and you can't adjust it down.   I understand that people are putting translucent tape  over the flash, and I'm sure that helps, but again--it seems ridiculous.

The camera is built rock solid.  It is comforting to turn it on, turn it off, grasp it---even drop it.    

I have owned (til I sold them on Ebay) the equivalent Cannon, Minolta, Sony and Nikon cameras, and what irked me about all of them was complexity.    Who needs all those baffling icons, and is there anyone on earth that can actually translate them all, especially when you're on the go?   These cameras are designed to carry around in your pocket and take nice photos.  If you aren't a professional, they will make you look alot like one!

I recommend the 500z because it is a tremendous value for a 5 megapixel camera that's easy to use, built like  tank, easy to carry and delivers awesome photos, even for an amateur.
