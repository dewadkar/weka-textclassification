            Our car is more than 10 years olds so we brought this new Impala car. It is gold color. I don't really like it that much at first. However, my husband love it. I would like to have a white or black car.  We couldn't get any white car due to county police stations brought most of the white Chevrolet Impala.
The car we have is a 4 door ls. It may seem tiny. However, it is wilder and bigger than BMW 525i. When you put your feet on the gas paddle, it runs as fast as you want to. The break light has huge light. Therefore, no one should miss it when you hit on the break. It is leather interior. I love leather. I guess that's one of the thing I like.  It has CD player,tape player and radio. It has child safety lock so your young kids can't open the windows or doors by themselves. Since my husband is working for PPG, they give him a great discount. The company allows he to do that on one car per year. You should check on your company policy. I love buying thing with big discount.
We have it for almost 7 months. When we are on the road, we often see other people driving the new Impala. When we park the car, there are always people pass by and ask about the new Impala. I guess people like it and think about getting the new Impala.<br><br>
