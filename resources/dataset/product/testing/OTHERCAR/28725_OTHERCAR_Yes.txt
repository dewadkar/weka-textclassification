                The Olympus d-380 is an excellent little digital camera at a great price.  Its pictures are crystal clear, even when blown up.  I use it for a real estate magazine at the pictures are equally as good as a 35 mm I have ever seen.  
    The Olympus d-380 retails for about $140, and at this price, it is a steal.  This includes 2 megapixel resolution (fine for most practical applications) and sharp LCD screen. It also has an .mpeg movie mode (no sound), which can take as long a film as your memory card can carry.  The included chip is small (8 mb), but is sufficient to hold 25 pictures at the medium resolution. I went ahead and purchased a 32 mb card, which set me back about $30. The controls are a bit ungainly, but once you grow accustomed to them, they get very easy. The controls and menus are very simple, as is set-up and computer installation. The included USB cable and software makes it a breeze to hook it up to the computer and transfer/edit pictures. 
     After using the product, I found that the snazzy little LCD screen cuts the battery life significantly. So one day I stopped in to my local Radio Shack,and for $14 I got 4 AA rechargeable batteries and a convenient car charger.  This was a godsend. This is my only real gripe with the product, which I would give a 4.7!
