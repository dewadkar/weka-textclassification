            We recently switched from a minivan to a Tahoe.  It was a long consideration because of the three children we have.  After driving a minivan for 4 years I was not sure what to expect.  I was thrilled that we made the decision.  I sit up higher and am able to see more of the road.  It handles better especially in the winter with difficult weather.  The inside seating space is quite comparable to that of the minivan with seats that are comfortable and roomy. The cargo space is very roomy with the fold down seats.  The stereo system is the best sounding with 8 speakers!This is a sporty yet practical family vehicle.  It can get through any conditions and can carry just about anything a family of 5 would need.  The extra options that the Tahoe comes with make it even more of a must have vehicle.  Once you own a Tahoe, you'll never want (or need) anything else!<br><br>
