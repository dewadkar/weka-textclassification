            My roommate recently purchased a Kia Sephia 2001. She was replacing a 16 year old car for only a few reasons. The old car did not have working A/C or Heat, the engine would shake real bad, and now was a financially good time for her to buy.

My roommate feared that one day she would try to turn on the car and it would not go. She was afraid that it would blow up as she was driving it. When she is toting around 2 young children, breaking down is really not an option. 

After looking at several models, including the elantra, a daewoo, and the kia, she decided that she liked the kia the best. She wanted a car with a 10 year warranty, because she didn't want to have to pay for repairs while she was still paying for the car.

The car has some nice features for the basic model. And she got the car for a really nice price. With automatic, she got the car for about $11,000. Then she got her trade in and rebate on top of that, which brought it under $10,000. 

Now for the downside....and there have been a lot of bad things happening with this car. 

The first repair occurred at 600 miles. The car would jolt when going from 1st to 2nd gear. They returned the car to her with the determination that there was nothing wrong. 

The second repair occured as a result of the first one. On her way home from the dealership, all of her dash lights started coming on one by one. They now determined that there was a problem with the battery, which they replaced. 

The third repair happened about a week later, because it was still jolting from 1st to 2nd gear. Finally they replaced the transmission. 

Then came the fourth repair. Not even an hour after picking the car up, the car started doing the same thing again. And it will probably be in for the entire week.

Now, it is obvious that my roommate has either gotten a lemon or the service people are completely incompetent. I will say that my parents were reading a review about the car in consumer reports after my roommate had purchased the car. Apparently this car was rated one of the worst cars to buy.

This is going to be a continuing saga, because I know that it is not over. She has mailed out the papers regarding the lemon law, and we will see what happens. 

My suggestion is that before you go out and buy this....wait for some more epinions. Also, do a lot of websurfing and newsgroups, because from what I understand there have been brake problems on some of the new kias.

UPDATE --- My roommate finally won to an extent. She turns her car back into Kia tomorrow, because they bought it back. Now she's buying an Elantra.
