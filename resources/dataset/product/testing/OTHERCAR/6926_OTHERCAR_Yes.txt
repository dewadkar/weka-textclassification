            It's great in all and I love it but would never recommend it to any family.  There's no back seat at all.  To bad Honda didn't think of making it into a four door like Toyota has with it's Prius.

The good thing of the design of the car, if you don't know, is that it gets excellent mileage.  A total of 70 miles per the gallon, maybe even more!  The way the gas prices are going up, I would buy it just for that.  Plus you don't have to plug it in, it's not that type of electric car.  It's a hybrid system that lets the gasoline engine charge your extra onboard system of batteries for you.

The only other bad thing I can think of besides not having a back seat though is the back order on them.  I'm sure you can wait because the price you get it for it is just simply harmony to your ears.  When I first saw it, I thought it's got to be out of my price range but it's not.  They're only on average $15,000 -20,000.  That's well worth the wait compare to the money you save on gas. 

This Honda is great for single people that want to ohh and awe your friends but if you have a family I would suggest you wait for the Toyota Pirus to come out in the summer.  I wish Honda would make a four door, that would be nice so I won't have to give up my tradition of only buying Honda.  Honda is just simply that great.
