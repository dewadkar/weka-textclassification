                 For the past year I have been lucky enough to be able to afford this car. I have a white Grand Am GT with RAM air, cloth interior, CD player, and a sun roof. It has been a slice of heaven... especially yesterday (as you will read). Not only have I loved it and taken good care of it, but I treat it to mid grade gas so I get the best mileage for my money. It's friendly interior and sound system have been comforting on long trips and around town. Everyone loves my car. There are signal lights for such things as oil changes and tire pressure which really helps to maximize the performance of the car in all situations. 
    Living in Michigan I have only experienced one problem with it... and that is driving in the snow. If the roads haven't been plowed well then I might as well not even try to go out; because the bottom is too low, and the plastic would be ruined. However, you would be hard pressed to find a car in this class that could handle snow any differently.
    Of all the amazing aspects of this car the one that I would like to highlight today is the safety you should feel while in it. Yesterday, January 18, I was in a crash that started out s a hit from the back (while I was stopped), and ended up pummeling my car forward into another stopped car. The car that hit me was traveling about 40 mph. We were stopped for a train at the time and near the front- so it was pretty scary. Not only did the airbags deploy and brakes come into effect once I had received initial impact, but I walked away from something that could have ultimately been awful. 
    Although I am without my car for a little while, and I wish that I wouldn't have had to deal with that in the first place, I feel extremely safe and comfortable with my car, my Grand Am is a little fortress.
