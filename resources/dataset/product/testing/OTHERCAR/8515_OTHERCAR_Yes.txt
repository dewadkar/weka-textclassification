            I bought the Dodge Ram after owning 2 midsize cars and 2 compacts. I bought it in the hopes of getting a boat to pull, which I did last month (see review of Glastron SX 170). Also, now that I live in a rural area, it comes in extremely handy for lugging stuff around. For trips to and from work, the ride is comfortable and smooth, not like the stereotypical bouncy truck ride.
The regular cab seats 3 comfortably as long as you don't mind not being able to access the cupholders or center console. Guages and controls are well places, with the exception of the turn signals. Those require a little extra reaching around the steering wheel to operate.
For the things that trucks are designed to do, Dodge does them well. The bed is plenty wide and fairly easy to load. It is a full size pickup, so the bed is higher than you would find on the Dakota or other similar trucks. Towing is a breeze. Hooking up the wiring took all of 3 minutes with a retail wiring kit. Finding the right ball hitch was a bit harder. The bumper hitch takes a 1" shaft width, but the length needs to be at least 2 1/2" to go all the way through.
The V6 is great for city driving and for towing or hauling light loads. There's not as many horses as the V8, but enough torque to do the job. I would not recommend the V6 for very hilly or mountainous areas.
Fuel economy is decent. I have averaged 10-15 mpg, although a longer trip across the state got up around 20.
I really like the Ram trucks, and I will go back for another if a truck is what I need. If you're going to use a truck as a truck, get a Ram.
