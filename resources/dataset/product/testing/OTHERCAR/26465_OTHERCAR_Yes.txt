            Any time is a good time to take the family on vacation.  Some of us may want to wait until it gets a bit cooler outside to do so.  But, when all the transportation means are available, one may feel a bit impatient.  If the small-size RV is parked in the back yard and the kids just want to explore the great outdoors, then it's time to use a sporty truck to take them out.  <b>For sure, this 2001 S-10 Crew Cab can make things easier. </b> I wanted to have a demonstration of the towing and hauling capacity of this truck.  So I headed to the nearby dealership that was holding one of these outdoor events on the campus of California State University, Fresno.  After taking care of all the identification papers, I was led by one of the salesmen to the S-10 Crew Cab.  He told me that it is available only as a 4 WD model.  The first thing you will notice is the fact that it has 4 doors which may allow the easy entry and exit of passengers. With that you take care of the problems that your kids have to stuff themselves in the back.  Nobody has to get out to let them in any longer!

As I walked around the Chevy, I could not help notice that the cab is a bit shorter.  What one loses on the cab length, one gets rewarded and compensated by the towing capacity of the S-10 Crew Cab.  The saleman made a bold attempt to compare it with other existing vehicles in its category.  He mentioned the Nissan Frontier Crew Cab, the Toyota Tacoma Double Cab.  He went on to say that I find the 2001 GMC Sonoma Regular Cab interesting too.  But nothing out there will beat the 190-horsepower, 4.3-liter Vortec V6, automatic transmission truck. 

<b>More Than a Work Truck:  The Chevy S-10 Crew Cab Can Hold Its Own On The Road!</b>

If you own a small trailer, you can say bye-bye to an expensive type of work truck that you would need to pull it.  Now you can do so with this truck.  The salesman asked me to hop in as he proceeded to take it out of the lot.  It was just by measure of precaution.  After exiting the campus, he pulled to the side of the road on Bullard and let me drive.  He asked me to go around and make some turns to see how easy they can be done with this truck.  After driving around the neighborhood, I was amazed at how easy and convenient towing and hauling passengers in this truck is.  As we stopped at one of these convenience stores that litter the city, I just pulled up and parked using three parking spaces nearby.  

<b>Pay no more hotel fees:  Truck can tow own RV!</b>

You can now bring a piece of your home and familiarity to your vacation destination.  You can bring whatever will make you feel at home.  Tow your own RV with this truck.  And when you don't want to tow, park the RV and use this sporty machine to work.  If you want to go to lunch and dinner with the family, there will be enough space in the back for everyone.

Just make up your mind and select the 2001 Chevrolet S-10 Crew Cab!
