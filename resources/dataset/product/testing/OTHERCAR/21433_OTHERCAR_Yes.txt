            So there I was with a Mazda 626 that was about to fall apart after 160,000- I needed a new car NOW. I looked around and dang if everything from the US and Japan isn't another $1500.00 or more- or bare bone models. I got the Elantra on December 14, 2000. I got option pak:4 that gave me a CD-sunroof-cruise control-cargo net-mud flaps-wind shield for sunroof-all said and done, $13,700. Now where else would you get a car equiped like that for that kind of money? (oh, and never mind the 100,000 mile warranty)
 Power has been weak in my opinion-considering there's 140 hp. under the hood- and I have wind noise around the driver door at 60 mph.+-also, the car seems to have a new creak - jitter- or rattle every week-nothing earthshaking-just annoying and unexpected in a brand-new car. (currently 2250.0 miles on car) 
Overall the car is quite nice- I feel that I drive a car that looks like $20,000 rather than the $13,700 that I paid!
