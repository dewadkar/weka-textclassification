            At 10:00 am on Saturday, November 22, 2003, I embarked on a 24-hour evaluation test drive of a 2004 Volkswagen Phaeton W12. This car represents the future of Volkswagen vehicles to come. There are two Phaeton models, one with a 330-hp V8 engine at $65,000, and the other with a 414-hp W12 engine at $85,000. My test drive of the W12 model included navigating the streets of New York City, highway travel through New Jersey, rural roads along the Delaware River, and impromptu acceleration, braking, and cornering testing in large parking lots.

<b>Likes</b>

W12 engine has locomotive pulling power. In urban driving, the acceleration is impressive and will surprise many respected sports car owners at stoplight takeoffs. On the highway, the W12 engine really shines as it really gets going past 80 mph. I had the car up to 120 mph before I backed-off and at that point the engine power continued to surge forward and felt like it could easily keep going. Ride and cabin insulation was excellent at speed and the only indication of my 120 mph blast was the alarming rate of scenery around me. I think the rumor is that the ungoverned speed capability is around 186 mph and I fully believe it after my test drive.

The amount of technology and features sets a new benchmark for this class segment. Attention to detail continues to amaze, including an indirect climate control system that selectively reveals and hides air vents throughout the cabin according to each passenger's temperature setting, rear headrests that automatically raise when sensors detect an occupant in the seat and lower when no one is in the seat for better driver visibility, and windshield wipers that automatically rotate the double-sided blades for extended wear.

The interior design and materials is first class. Front and rear seats have heat and cooling ventilation, as well as massagers. An analog clock in the center console is a nice touch (an idea likely borrowed from Bentley, although I kept thinking of the Infiniti clocks which they made such a big deal about in the 1990s).

Instrumentation includes an indicator to display the currently engaged gear (not just "D" or Drive, but D-1, D-2, D-5, etc as the gears changed).

Rear legroom was outstanding. I could cross my legs while seated and still had plenty of space between me and the front seats.

Instrument pod includes a secondary info screen to display immediate navigation instructions ( i.e. left turn in 500 feet) works well in peripheral vision without taking eyes off road to view larger nav screen in center console.

This is a driver's car as much as it is a back seat passenger's car.

<b>Dislikes</b>

Construction not quite as solid as Mercedes and BMW, despite the heft of its 5,000-pound weight.

Suspension does not ride and handle as well as Mercedes S-Class and BMW 7-Series, despite the driver-adjustable suspension settings. I suspect this is due in part to the setup of the 18-inch wheels and high tire pressures (42 psi front, 48 psi rear) but both Mercedes and BMW manage to offer more compliant rides with large diameter wheels and tires.

Steering is surprisingly too light. Again, Mercedes and BMW offer more satisfying weighted steering feedback.

Instrument dials are hard to read at a glance, especially in daylight.

Seat massagers are too weak. Mercedes S-Class has a more satisfying massage function.

Trunk is small for this class of car.

Annoying legal disclaimer on nav screen must be "accepted" every time you start the car.

Release buttons for trunk and gas filler door are located too far from reach in the driver's door.

Keyless entry missing a keyless ignition feature, like the Mercedes Keyless Go.

No soft-close doors, even though the trunk lid is completely electronic.

No ambient light sensor for headlights (auto on).

E-ZPass tag does not transmit through heated windshield.

I averaged 10-14 mpg on my mixed-use test drive.

<b>Summary</b>

A fantastic value of performance and features when compared with its class competitors (Mercedes S-Class, BMW 7-Series, Audi A8, Jaguar XJ). Maybe a better Lexus LS, Infiniti Q45. But will anyone pay these prices for a Volkswagen?

The only 12-cylinder luxury sedan in the world with all-wheel-drive (as of November 2003 ... the Audi A8 V12 Quattro is due out soon). Even so, the Phaeton makes an unmatched low-profile statement for those who wish to "fly under the radar" (i.e. high profile personalities such as CEOs, politicians, etc) but don't want to sacrafice all the goodies of this class of car.

Post-sale experience is in question. Phaeton dealers are being specially trained for exceptional customer service in sales and maintenance/repair, but the risk still remains whether this program will be successfully implemented. And, considering the hit-or-miss service experiences of "lesser" Volkswagen vehicles (i.e. Golf, Jetta, Passat), shouldn't all Volkswagens receive the same exceptional customer service? Show me a car company that cares for all of its customers at the same exceptional level, and I'll show you a loyal brand consumer that will keep coming back for more.
