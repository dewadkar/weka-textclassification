            For all you girls looking for guys, there is a simple answer to that problem.  Buy a Chevy Truck!  Because of its great looks everybody looks as you drive by and then they can't believe that its a girl driving it.  
I bought this truck because I love the way I feel in such a big car and I love its looks.  I feel a great sense of security in a big car like this 

one.  I love the way it runs and it is so dependable.  I have a 1998 Chevrolet Silverado and it hasn't given me one problem yet.  I also love the fact that my truck has a third door.  This door makes it so much easier for people to get in and out of the spacious back seat without bothering the person in the front seat.  The only thing I can think of that I hate about this truck is that it doesn't get very good gas 

mileage.  This truck has seats that almost make you feel like you are sitting on a couch.  They, are so comfortable!  Anyone who likes to feel safe and in control when they are driving should buy a truck like this one.  It is also great for towing and hauling things since it is so powerful and has a huge bed in the back.<br><br>
