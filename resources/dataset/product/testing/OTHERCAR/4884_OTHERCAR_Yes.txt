            In short:

The new headlights on this car are amazing especially when
you drive on rural, dirt roads without the benefit of
side of the road lights. It is a well-built driver's car
with strong performance and safety features.

Why it is unique

Ignition key in the center console that locks the 
transmission but not the steering column.

Heritage

Saab's appearance has always been distinctive. The 
company that first brought the car out first made
jet fighter planes. The car is more adaptive to
rough weather than BMW or Mercedes rear wheel 
drive having always been front wheel drive cars.

Teh base model is called Linear which from its 
2.3 liter, 4-cylinder engine.  The middle of the line
is now called ARc and sis standard with 3-liter, 6-cylinder
low pressure turbo and a new 5-speed automatic transmission
And the top of the line Aero is a precision driving
instrument when in skilled hands.

The new 5 speed automatic is very responsive
and stronger than the old 4-speed.  You drive
by controlling the shift character by setting the
transmission to normal, sport, or winter.

Style

Traditional Saab cockpit design.  The step in is easy
and the seats tend to hug your body and create
a secure position while the cockpit wraps around you.
Strong chassis, the Saab controls the suspension
better than ever for precise handling and a 
comfortable ride.  

Cost

Can have well equipped Linear for 35,000 and a 
luxurious Arc or sport Aero for a little less than
$40,000.
