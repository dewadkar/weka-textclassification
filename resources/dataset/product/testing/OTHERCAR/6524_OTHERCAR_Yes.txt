            I bought my 1994 Pontiac Sunbird LE 4 cylinder in 1997 from a car lot.  It is pretty roomy in the front but a little cramped in the back.  The back seat is great for kids. It drives pretty well. When I bought it it had 64,446 miles on it and now it has 112,000 miles.  I have never had to have any brake work done. I have had 1 tune up and I am getting ready to do another.  I paid for a 24,000 mile warranty when I bought it and good thing I did because the most expensive work I have had done was during the time it was covered under warranty. The first time I took it in the problem was gas leaking from the fuel pressure regulator. They had to replace the fuel pressure regulator and the fuel line.  They had to recharge the battery and fixed the lighter which was also broke.  It would have cost $310.32 but I only had to pay the $50.00 deductible. The second time I took it in They replaced the water pump and the timing belt.  Which would have cost $418.90 but only cost me the $50.00 deductible.  Since the warranty expired I have replaced the battery and alternator once.  Here are the current problems some are purely cosmetic but annoying.  The turn signal switch broke completely off.  The only thing holding it on is the wires for the cruise control.  It broke off in my hand when I was turning the turn signal on.  The dash lights are all not working except for the ones on the left side of the dash. They come on every once in a while and then go off again.  Something electrical probably but hopefully nothing serious.  There are hole in the driver's side door from where the seat belt has went right through it when I shut the door.  My console does not latch.  The air conditioner does not work. I have been told I cannot just have them recharge it and put in freon because they tell me if it needs freon then there has to be a leak somewhere.  I've been told if there is a leak that it would cost anywhere from $900 to $1500 to fix the problem.  I do like that my car has a trunk release that can be turned off and on.  I like how the stereo is up higher than they are in most cars.  I have not found a stereo that can be bought to replace the factory one in it.  The stereo is a great factory stereo. The ashtray is very small it holds maybe 3 cigarette butts.  I like the where the on and off switches are for the lights and windshield wipers.   The trunk is pretty big.  The ashtray in the back seat falls out.  Sometimes the electric locks don't unlock when the car is turned off like it is supposed to. I try to unlock them on my side they won't unlock so I have to reach over to unlock it.   <br><br>
