            Surely, from the title of this review you have already guessed it's not a very good camera!  

The ephoto smile digital camera is what it's name sounds like; a &quot;beginner's&quot; camera.  The camera's resolution and picture quality is that of a kodak insta-matic, and even that is being a little more liberal than this camera deserves!  Even the software that is included with the camera has problems and the manufacturer is aware of it.  There is a software patch that can be downloaded off of the agfa website to improve the communication between your camera and your pc, although once you get the camera hooked-up and you are finally able to view your pictures, you will see that out of the 16 image capacity that maybe 2 or 3 of your images are clear.

If you are looking for a decent digital camera, I would suggest spending a bit more money and getting higher resolution, better quality and a camera that holds a disk with a higher image capacity. (The ephoto smile only holds internal images that must be cleared from its memory to take new pictures!)

Well, in conclusion, I would not recommend this camera to anyone.  Not even to someone looking for a &quot;starter digital camera&quot; as it is a sure disappointment even for a beginner. It might make a good gift for a 8 or 9 year old, but I'm sure that it too will end up in the bottom of the toy box!!!<br><br>
