            My father, a middle-aged former autocross driver, bought the car of his dreams one year ago. He's always been in love with tiny front-engine rear-drive roadster sports cars, and the Mazda MX-5 Miata is the epitome of the breed. He bought a black 1996 model with tan leather interior, tan top and 24,000 miles. 

I borrow it whenever I can. It's the most driving fun I've ever had. 

When you sit in the relatively cramped cockpit (I'm over six feet and 220 pounds), you can immediately tell the car was meant to be driven. Every control is within easy, intuitive reach, and the stark black and white instrument panel is very clear and easy on the eyes. When you turn the key, you are greeted with the welcoming growl of a finely-tuned engine. My first thought when I fired it up for the first time was: &quot;This is a Japanese car?&quot;

The first thing I noticed upon actually putting the car in motion was the fact that the clutch and short-throw gearshift work like magic together; I have never driven a car whose transmission seemed more in tune with itself (but then, I have never driven a stick-shift BMW). It is supremely difficult to stall the car. I think it's because it likes to stay in motion. 

Once on the road, the car's true genius shines through. While not overly powerful (my Plymouth Neon actually has more horsepower), acceleration is adequate. And it feels like you're going much faster, especially with the ragtop down, the wind in your hair, and the four-cylinder humming happily behind you. Not only was this car made to be driven, it was made to be driven with <i>spirit,</i> made to be taken out and thrown on a curvaceous back road with abandon. 

It loves curves; it eats them up. The rear-drive chassis and superb power-to-weight ratio (don't ask for the numbers; I didn't understand what the term meant at all until I drove this car) make traveling a hairpin turn at 40 miles per hour a joy. <i>Brake just before the turn, coast to the apex, power through ... YES.</i> This car simply loves to drive. 

The Miata is the first car I've ever driven that actually has a personality. It lives for the driver. It, <i>she,</i> responds quickly, surely, with pleasure, to your commands. 

Does it sound like I love this car? Of course. Anyone who loves to drive must love the Miata. Yet it has its downfalls, as does any piece of machinery. It is <i>small.</i> On long trips, I become cramped and sore. It simply isn't for the excessively tall; anyone more than a few inches over six feet might be unable to drive it altogether. Other than that, comfort is adequate. The leather covered seats are supportive and firm. For normal-sized people, long trips are fine. Luggage space, however, is well-nigh nonexistent, though Mazda (or an affiliate) makes a special suitcase that fits like a glove in the diminutive trunk. 

The styling is classic, though the '96 model has the flip-up headlights. They look cool at first, but they have the effect of breaking up the car's otherwise superbly clean lines. I prefer the flush headlamps of the newer models. The ragtop (love that word) is quite easy to set up and take down. With a little practice, it can be done in under two minutes. 

Maintenance is complicated. Since the engine compartment is as small as the rest of the car, routine service can be problematic. However, the Mazda dealer we do business with is very reasonable, and performs maintenance at a low cost and quickly. 

Overall, this is one of the finest modern pure sports cars out there. What it lacks in power, it makes up for in sheer pleasure to drive. It's relatively inexpensive for a car of its type, which is another plus. For anyone who really wants a sports car without spending an arm and a leg, the Miata deserves a serious look -- and drive.<br><br>
