            I purchased the vehicle right out of college primarily because it was cheap and because of positive reliability data provided by consumer magazines. I experienced about average reliability. A number of mechanical components were replaced under warranty (steering rack and pinion, and an alternator). Luckily, I had no problems since the warranty ended. There were a few problems that I had to live with for as long as I owned the car. The dealer was unable find fixes despite numerous attempts. The most annoying were the air-condition that never provided adequate cooling and a persistent hesitation. Additionally, there were a number of assembly defects such as missing bolts, loose trim, etc.

The engine does a good job at getting the car up to speed and the brakes work well slowing it down. The car handles very well on dry pavement, but has a tendency to loose traction too easily in the wet.  Surprisingly for such an inexpensive car, the cabin is pretty quiet no matter what the speed you are traveling. The car has been inexpensive to maintain, although a number of items are stating to wear, requiring frequent visits to the shop.  The gas mileage has been pretty good; about 25 overall.  My friend with a stick gets about 35 on average. I recently replaced the struts with KYB units when the originals wore out and now what I would consider fun to drive. 

The car's best quality has been longevity, it performs as well as the day I purchased it (including faults). This car is perfect for a person that needs frugal transportation, such as myself, for commuting to and from work. <br><br>
