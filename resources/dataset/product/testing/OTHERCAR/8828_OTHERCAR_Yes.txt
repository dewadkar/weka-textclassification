            I've had the incredible honor of owning a 99' civic, a 99'accord, and a 2000 accord. if you asked how this came about you wouldn't believe me if i told you. Well anyway i also had the struggles of goin to a mass amount of Honda dealers and test driving a unbeliavable amount of Hondas. So please trust me cause my opinion does count if your looking to buy a Honda. The civics drive is nothing compared to the accord because the civic is a smaller car and is most likely gonna have less cylinder enginge, but the civics are amazing on gas. The Accords blow the civics to pieces because they come in not only 4cyl. but also v6. They are more longer and wider and have much more control and durability on the road, with an incredibly smooth ride. The Accord is an amazing piece of machinery. I was in a minor accident with my 2000 accord 2 days after i picked it up off the lot, and the only reason i can say it was minor is because i had an accord... it took the impact amazing, and left the car wit only a few scratches on the rear door on the drivers side.The safety in this car is quite remarkable. The interior of the Accord is so roomy and has a tremendous amount of space for a car its size. I can't think of much cares that can compare to the Honda Accord in any situation, it is one of the best all around cars on the market today!!! Hondas are also known for gettin good mileage and lasting long times.<br><br>
