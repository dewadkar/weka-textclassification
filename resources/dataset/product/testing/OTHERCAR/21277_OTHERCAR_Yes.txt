            Forgive me father, for I have sinned. I'm a HORRIBLE car owner. I drive abusively, I hardly ever change the oil, I let things go too long, and I hardly ever wash it. 

This is quite a testament to the 1992 Camry. 

I bought mine in 1996 when it still had only 42,000 miles on it. It's the LE model (V6), and while the leather interior and CD player are only incidental, they make the experience that much better.

The only problem I ever had with this car was the waterpump seal. This might seem like a small thing, but like I said, I'm a horrible car owner. I had noticed a little bit of an oil leak, and didn't do anything about it right away. When water started getting into the oil, the oil became corrosive and ALL the seals broke on my car. My little oil leak became an oil MONSOON. And one night I was driving down the freeway and the car caught fire!

Stop worrying. It was just a little fire. I smacked it out with a towel. The next day I was driving it into the dealer (with some degree of alacrity) and a very nice policeman stopped me because I rolled through a stopsign. 

&quot;I'm sorry officer, but my car seems to be on fire, so I was sorta in a hurry.&quot;

&quot;Wait here please.&quot;

I wait, with smoke billowing from my hood and a small crowd gathering, whilst the kind officer writes me a ticket. After awhile, I nervously stepped out of the car ... just in case. 

But I digress. I was smart enough to buy a warrantee with the car, and Toyota fixed everything FOR FREE. I got ALL new seals--which is almost the same as a completely rebuilt engine. I love Toyota!

Like I said, that's the only problem I've ever had with the car (except noisy brakes, but that's probably because I got a cheap brake job.)

The car now has 150,000 miles on it, and it still drives like new. When I wash it, I can still drive it with pride. It's still got plenty of pep, and I love it!
