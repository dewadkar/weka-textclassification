            The 3000GT VR-4 is an extremely fun car to drive.  4-wheel drive, 4-wheel steering, and the extra wide tires make the driving experience extremely easy and fun.  It is also a very sharp looking car, and the interior is ergonomically designed to suit the driver's needs.
The car is not without inconveniences though.  Maintenance is extremely expensive, along with most insurance policies.  Be prepared to fill up the tank between every week to two weeks, even though the gas tank will hold 20 gallons.  The car is also extremely heavy, although the 4 wheel drive, turbos, and 4-wheel anti-lock brakes more than make up for that. Replacing tires also proves to be quite an expensive endeavor itself.  
Overall, I love my car, and I would not trade it for the world.  I never have more than two people in it, so if the back seat is inadequate for passengers, it does not affect me.  The car seats all sizes of people very comfortably in the front seat due to all the seat adjustments that one can make.  I would recommend it to anyone who does not have to haul around a lot of people or equipment, and does not mind spending a little money on fuel and maintenance.<br><br>
