            Awesome web cam in an area with a LOT of light.  Also has room monitoring, video capture, and additional software such as SpotLife included on the installation CD.

I wasn't real thrilled at first with the web cam experience until I realized additional lighting improved the imaging as a web cam 100 percent.

Indoor photos are fair but also require a lot of light.  For an example of photo quality with proper lighting, see the picture in my epinions profile.  It was taken with this camera.

Outdoor photos are awesome even in the late evening.  There is room to store 160 photos at a time on the camera.

Transfer to the pc from the camera is as easy as plugging it back in.  The photos will load onto your pc in seconds and you have the option to delete them from the cam or not.

The camera shuts off after 30 seconds which is good because it saves wear and tear on the batteries.
