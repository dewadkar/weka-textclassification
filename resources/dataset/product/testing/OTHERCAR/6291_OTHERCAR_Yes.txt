            We reacently purchased a 1995 red conv. corvette, and it is a great car. This car is incredible, a great deal for the price. Then handling is great, just recently took it for a ride in Santa Cruz, very good on cornering (can take the turns faster than our miata). Very good acceleration, at 70 or 80 mph it accelerates like it were at 0. The wide tires grip the road, the car itself is a real head turner! Has easily dust a majority of other sports cars we've seen. The leather seats are to die for, it is incredibly comfortable, even on the long trips. The stereo system is awsome, and it has the speed sensitive volume control, which means the faster u go, the louder the music gets, and when u slow down, the music goes down, and it really works(can easily hear the music at 95). Overall, its a great car, doesn't require much maitainance. A few cons, it guzzles fuel, and gas isn't cheap. Another con, the speeding tickets seem to come out of nowhere, when your in this car going 90, you don't really notice it.<br><br>
