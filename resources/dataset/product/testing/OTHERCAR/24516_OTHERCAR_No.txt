            I've been using the camera for about 3 months now.  It was very quick to learn (my first digital) I was experimenting with the manual controls after my first day (necessary if you're taking action shots indoors)

In general I've been quite pleased with the camera.  The color is good, and with some setup I can take many pictures very quickly, the camera is sturdy (dropped it at Disney once)   

Even movie mode, which I was afraid would be cheesy and never used, turned out to be a real hit with my kids.  I do wish it had sound, especially when taking quick movies of some of the Disney parades.

I have seen the red problem that the other reviewers mentioned.  Most often it occurs when I'm taking pictures indoors without the flash.  

You will need to get a couple of rechargeables and the recharger from Nikon.  I looked around for 3rd party rechargers, but Nikon seemed to be cheaper and less bulky.  The battery life is pretty good *except* when using the flash.  The flash drains batteries very, very quickly.
