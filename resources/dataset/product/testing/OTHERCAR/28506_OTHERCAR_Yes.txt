            I have always talked about buying a Saab for the last 8 years.  Now that I have finally graduated and working full time, I decided to buy myself a little present.  Since you only live this life once, I decided to buy a convertible.  I plan on having a family some day, so I wanted something a little more practical.  With this thought in mind, my sportier choices were axed quickly:  Porshe Boxster, Audi TT, and BMW Z3.  I also bought my car during blizzard like conditions, so that knocked out my other choices:  BMW X5 and Jeep Cherokee.

With those options in mind, I was looking at:  Audi A4T (w/4wd) and BMW 323ci (convertible).  In short, I didn't get the Audi b/c you get so much more car w/the Saab, and the BMW was too highly priced (plus not all the dealers had them, demand was too high).  The fold down rear seat greatly expanded the cargo room, increasing the 9-3's practicability.

The best thing about the Saab (other than price -- great rebates at the time) is the handling and the acceleration.  Both are smooth and effortless.  Be warned, however, though it's FWD, the lack of roof takes a lot of weight off and you'll be in torque steering before you know it, though only a problem in deep snow and ultra-slick surface.

If there was one thing I could fix it would be the ABS.  The brakes are responsive but don't feel tight, which means that you don't feel like you're losing too much momentum in a hard break and your body isn't lurching forward.  However, the ABS feels like it engages too early and there is a lot of feedback coming thru the pedal.  I've already put on 8k and I haven't had any repair problems.  In fact, none of my neighbors have ever had any major problems with their various Saabs.

Driving this car is like a dream.  It's fast, oh boy is it fast.  I can get the same acceleration between 5-20 mph as I do 45-60.  The controls are very responsive, the car hugs the road.  Slippery conditions are the only problem, and I probably could get around that if I had a real roof.

If you can afford this car or, like me, find a great deal, jump on it.  I guarantee you won't regret it.  If you don't like quirky appeal, small engines, efficiency, don't buy this car.  I guarantee that no car has as much space, is as fast, is as reliable, is as safe, as the Saab.<br><br>
