            Simply comfortably basic.  Now I know why so many people buy it - this is a great utilitarian car for the masses.  And that's the caveat, there are literally millions sold and half of them seem to be in the San Francisco Bay Area.  They're everywhere!

Pros:
1) The car feels familiar the minute you sit in it.   No manual or video tape required to figure out knobs and controls.  No fuss, no bell and whistles.
2) Nice engine.  Quiet at low speeds and very responsive to your whims at all speeds.
3) Good trunk space - wide and deep.
4) Roomy interior at both driver and passenger sides.
5) Good value - with an average price of $17k, it's really a good bargain.

Cons:
1) Styling - beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but the design seems to totally escape me here.  This is the vanilla of designs.
2) Soft handling and suspension - if it's any softer than it might as well be an American car.  This is a cruiser.
3) Seat not supportive at thigh area, especially when turning curves at highway speeds.
4) Arm rest gets in the way.   It doesn't stick out far enough to rest you arms or back far enough to frequently bump it.
5) Because so many people have the same car, and also likely to have the same color, Toyota should keyless remote entries, or multiple stylistic trims. My rental is brown, and there is always at least 2 or 3 in the parking lot.  And driving in car country California is like driving with gigantic mirrors around you, there's always a Camry everywhere you turn. 

Camry is essentially Gap on wheels.  It's comfy, no-nonsense and economical, but it's not something you show off in.  And everyone you know has the same/similar shirt.<br><br>
