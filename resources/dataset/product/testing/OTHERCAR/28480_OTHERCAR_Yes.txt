            For many years, I had been driving a 1988 Ford Bronco. I have always enjoyed getting my bones jarred by bumps while riding on rough Montana dirt roads. I would always keep my left foot poised above the clutch, ready to vault over snow drifts while maintaining control of my vehicle. Yes, those were the days of my youth.

My family has always been a used truck family; being a Bronco owner, I first checked out the Ford dealership. I was very unimpressed with the 'pussed out' full-sized SUVs. I wanted a truck. I tried the Ford Explorer Sport-Trak, which felt good and stiff. I really liked the toy, and thought I would come back to buy it.

Enter Envoy.

I called my uncle, who purchased a 199[6,7?] Tahoe: a metal slug with wishy-washy suspension that I hated. "Jeff, check out the Envoy, you might like it."

I stopped by the GMC dealership and took a peek at the Envoy. No chromed bumper. Looks 'pussed out'... oh dear, methinks it should be what the BMWs call their X5: a "Sports Activity Vehicle." Surely it will have wishy-washy suspension, too, just like the old Tahoe, just perfect for all of my sports activities.

Boy, was I surprised.

I went for a test-drive. I stomped on the gas, and... my internal organs were rearranged. It had power. In a short time, I drove a very large distance due to acceleration unlike anything I had felt before in an SUV (my Bronco had 8 cylinders and only 200 limping horses). I was very impressed with this quiet little row of six. 

I noticed that, although it had a very soft and smooth ride, I could still pick up the little bumps and grooves in the road that I could always feel in the Bronco, so I still felt like my driving was tied to reality. Its softness made me feel a little odd in turns, but steering was tight, very much like of a much smaller car. It was stiff in the body and did not waver. Even though it felt nice, it was _secure_ on the road... much less squirrely than my Bronco.

I noticed how smooth the transmission was. It was very nice, much better than my mother's klunky automatic Bronco. I also noticed that I am now living in Los Angeles, and noticed very few manual transmissions, and noticed that automatics resell more quickly down here.

I then noticed that I was a single guy who, at some time in the future, might want a female passenger to feel some degree of comfort in his car. Maybe this very quiet, posh, safe, perky car could work out...

I guess other people think that the Envoy could use a five speed. I completely disagree. Mechanically more simple is mechanically more better, less weight, and this six-banger produces plenty of torque at lower RPMs. Instant power-on-demand when darting about in LA freeway traffic.

I thought I didn't need bells and whistles, but two hours and $15,000 later I realized how cool all the fun little features were when I paid the down payment on the fully-loaded SLT.
Then began the share of disappointments:

The compartment between the seats did not latch and lock. It kept on flipping up. I looked at the cheap, crappy plastic flange locking mechanism, and had my dealer repair it a week later. It turned out that GMC just had a brand-new recall on that particular part. They replaced the crappy plastic locking flange with an equally crappy but far more functional plastic flange.

I also noticed that the simulated wood was actually fairly thin plastic. The plastic flange actually locks into a cutout in this simulated wood plastic.

The next problem occurred when we had the first rain in weeks down here. I got into my car that rainy morning and noticed water trickling down by my feet.

The dealership had to re-seal the windsheild. Oops, good job GM.

I've also noticed that the car seems to get about 10MPG in city, a bit lower than what the sticker said. I don't drive aggressively, so this is rather unfortunate, and seems to give the gas tank a range of about 300 miles, which is a bit less than I am used to.

Overall, though, I am very pleased with the car, and love the heated seats dearly. The Envoy feels much more safe than my Bronco, although its lower clearance will get me high-centered one of these days I decide to drive back to Montana. I love how throaty and quiet that magical little six cylinder is, and I adore the automatically dimming rear-view mirrors.
