            I like the ECHO on paper. I like the image Toyota is trying to establish for the ECHO. I like how roomy the interior is. I like the little storage spaces everywhere. I think it's a really cute little car . . . in a bulldog-cute sort of way. 

Months ago, when I began my new car search in earnest, I sat in a bright red one at the dealership on a day I didn't have time to test drive it properly, and I felt something. It was that special simpatico that you experience sometimes in friendships--a sort of instant admiration. I ran my hands lightly over the storage space (perfect for CDs!) next to the control panel and relaxed into the firm-but-comfortable seat. I glanced at the mileage estimates on the window sticker--up to 41 miles per gallon! I looked out over the dealer parking lot from my lofty (relatively speaking) perch and I nodded slowly. This was going to be my new car. I left the dealership that day with visions of driving away my own cute little ECHO with my kayak on top and paddling gear stored in the cavernous trunk. I could almost hear my friends saying &quot;Astrid, this car is just YOU!&quot; when I drove past. After reading the brochure about the available options, I entertained scenarios in which a terrible Great Lake tsunami wave hit Chicago and, due to my ECHO's ABS system, great storage spaces, and power doors (I didn't quite figure out how power doors would help in the tsunami disaster, but I figured I could find a way to work it in) I was able to save myself and my dog. Or maybe myself and my dog and my brothers and their dogs. Pretty soon, my ECHO had stranded kittens in the passenger under-the-seat storage bin and grateful nuns singing the ECHOs praises in the backseat. And this led me to rather elaborate fantasies of the Toyota marketing people seeing the footage of how Astrid Saved Chicago and the interviews of my heroic feats, and announcing &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen, we have found our ECHO spokesperson!&quot; Hmmm. Make that &quot;spokesmodel.&quot;

And then I drove the ECHO. 

Let me begin by saying that if Chicago were hit with a tsunami wave, I think the nuns would be safer relying on prayer than on the ECHO. I drove it on smooth city streets (a rarity in the city) and still could feel every single bump in the road through the steering wheel. The gears (I'm a manual transmission fan) were hard to shift--I actually missed the gear entirely once and ended up revving the car with that gear crunching sound that all manual transmission people cringe to hear. The acceleration was poor. In order to get any speed at all I had to floor the gas pedal. When I did floor the pedal, the car continued to rev after I released the gas, almost as though the gas pedal were stuck. Finally, taking turns--and remember that this is all city driving, I didn't get the car above 50 mph during the whole test drive--made the ECHO feel wobbly. I didn't get the impression that the car would roll, but it was a less than reassuring feeling nevertheless.

The final nail in the ECHO's coffin was when I went back to the dealership after the test drive and found out that practically all the options I wanted on the ECHO were unavailable in the Midwest. ABS, power doors, even the all-weather upgrade, were not currently in production here. And the Toyota dealer had no idea when these options might be available.

And so, with a sigh and a pat on the ECHO's tall roof, I walked away. I ended up buying a Honda Civic, which offered a smooth ride, a luxurious interior, and a good resale value, but about which I have had no Earth-saving fantasies at all. 

Sometimes I see ECHOs on the road in Chicago, and I long to stop some of them and ask the owners if they're happy. I even feel a little wistful when I see a red one drive by . . . that kind of bittersweet feeling you get when you see someone you were once fond of whose friendship you have now outgrown. 

But then I drive over a pothole in my Honda and almost don't even notice it as I'm smoothly shifting into gear, and think, &quot;Who ever heard of a Great Lake tsunami?&quot;<br><br>
