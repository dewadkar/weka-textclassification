            We bought this vehicle for our two kids and their friends, in 1998.  It has been reliable, sturdy, and a pretty good suv.  We got the SLT Magnum V8, with everything but leather(which I now regret).  The strength of the Durango was put to the test in Yosemite, when a full grown brown bear climbed on top of it.  There was no heavy structural damage, only a dented bumper and some scratched paint.  My one complaint is the interior.  I am a big guy (6'3&quot;), and wish that we had got the leather seats, as those in the Durango are very uncomfortable.  Also, the interior of the 1998 is crude and poorly built.  I think that Dodge could have done a better job on this vehicle, and I have heard the new ones have been redesigned as of the interior, which is very good.  I suggest to buy the V8, even though gas is going up, as well as getting the leather and not buying the 1998.  It handles like a slug, which is standard among larger SUVs.  Acceleration is OK, braking is fair, and in turning it leans way over.  As it is based off of a truck chasis, it does best when loaded. I think that a family of four or five would be best use this vehicle.  A small family, or anyone who drives a lot of miles should not buy this SUV.<br><br>
