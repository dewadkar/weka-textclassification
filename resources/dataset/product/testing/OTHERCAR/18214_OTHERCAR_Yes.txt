            I needed a new ride.  One that I could depend on for at least the next five years.  And I have found it.  The Acura Integra is a cute piece of eye candy that has a nice foundation under the hood and great accessories inside.  Understand of course this is my third car (first being an '87 Dodge Shadow and the second a Nissan '91 240SX).

Outside
Great, modern shape with the sporty spoiler (embedded brake light) and round headlights.  Fine alloy wheel-covers (easily replaced with rims).

Inside
Comfy seats with Lumbaar adjustments, tilt steering (for us tall people).  The dashboard is arranged in such a way that the clock is just below the windshield so your don't wander far from the road.  The LS includes V6 engine, power steering, locks, and windows, A/C, cruise control (controls conveniently located on the steering wheel), rear wiper, CD player, two-level memory AM/FM radio, cassette, plenty of "knick knack" storage (on both doors and inner console), security system, ABS brakes, dual airbags, and the coup-de-gras (for me) a power sunroof.  Whew!  Basically, it's fully loaded. 

The car drives something LOVELY: it has great pick up, good speed, and excellent handling.  The steering is right with you when you're ready.  The trunk is huge for a car it's size and there are two keys (a valet key for doors and ignition, and a master key that you hold that accesses all locks).

This car is my new project.  Many like to do it up with all the fancy tint, chromes, and clear covers...We'll see with mine.  You can count on this one for a reasonable price and since Acura is a subdivision of Honda, you can count on quality.
