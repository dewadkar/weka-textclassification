            With a one and a three year old and now a new puppy, my husband and I were taking roll after roll of film with our 35mm.  We finally decided it was time to invest in a digital camera.  I was tired of having to take two or three shots of a pose because I was worried one of the shots wouldn't come out when we had them developed.  So, began the research of the best digital camera at the best price.  We had a pretty strict budget (wanted to stay around $250).  We ended up finding the FinePix 2600 online for $269 with free shipping and a rebate that basically made an additional 64MB SmartMedia memory card free (it comes with a 16MB card which is already better than it's higher priced competition).

This is a wonderful little camera.  I still cannot believe how beautiful the colors are with this.  Fuji calls it their Advanced Color System and it IS advanced.  There is a 3X optical zoom, which is great for this price range of digital cameras.  The menus are very easy to read and go through.  This camera is also very small, which I didn't think I would like, but it is really convenient.  We took it out to the u-cut Christmas tree lot last weekend and I was able to just stick it in my coat pocket!  It is very light I think, in part, because it only takes 2 AA batteries.  A pair of NiMH were included along with a charger.  We don't use the camera for longer than probably 20 minutes at a time every couple of days, but we have been able to go for a couple of weeks without having to recharge the batteries.  

The only thing I don't really like about this camera is the flash.  We have found that the flash is not very strong (up to 9 ft.) and we have had to turn a lot of lights on for a couple of group pictures (in the video mode, you need to have a lot of light too).  

I also wanted to see how actual prints turned out with this camera.  I took advantage of one of the online free print offers and got back some of them last week.  I had taken them at the 2M (1600 X 1200) "Normal" range and they were great!  The color was a bit less vivid than on-screen, but I was delighted at how great they were.  I was worried because I had never had digital pictures printed before and although most of mine will stay in my computer, I keep scrapbooks and still wanted quality pictures to have printed.
