            This Audi A4 is my first luxury car.  I've previously owned two Jeep Grand Cherokees, a Honda Del Sol, and a variety of klunkers.  I've been waiting for years to buy an Audi and I've finally obtained one!

Boy, I have to say I'm am in no way shape or form sorry I got this car.

First off, I was initially comparing this car to the BMW 325xi (All Wheel Drive).  After driving both cars I came away with good impressions from both, so the decision was tough, but not impossible.  The pricing was about equal, the BMW salesman was a friggin' SOB, the BMW had a very sporty suspension, the Audi had a much nicer interior.  The exteriors of both were very appealing, the BMW with that beastly glare, and the Audi with the "sleeper" incognito sedan with the sporty stance.  The performance of both cars were excellent.  In the end, the superior ride of the Audi along with the luxurious interior won me over.

Since owning the car, I've put about 2000 miles on it in a month, this includes a five hour trip north to Dallas.  I could have napped the whole way.  The car was extremely comfortable (lumbar supports), the Sunroof was open but extremely quiet, the acceleration at highway speeds was extremely responsive.  You can easily go from 70mph to well above 100mph very quickly, with your head pushed against the headrest from the acceleration.  I must say I now have to watch the speedometer more carefully.  With the Jeeps, the noise and the feel of the road told me I was traveling at 70mph.  On one occasion, in the Audi I was traveling at just over 100mph in the rain and wondered why everyone else was going so slow, after a few minutes I figured out the problem and promptly corrected my right foot.  It's toooo quiet!

The car grips like an Indy race car.  On wet polished pavement in the parking lot, I was unable to make the Quattro system break loose (no automatic traction control).  High speed banking turns prove to be no problem and they're so much fun you'll barely notice the sweat beading up on your hands and forehead.

All of this racehorse behavior in a four door sedan that looks like your mother's car.  I must say that it bends to your will.  If you feel like poking around town enjoying the weather on a Sunday afternoon, this car loves it.  If you feel like stomping the pedal on the open road listening to the rumble of the exhaust, again this car loves it.

The car is about 4500lbs.  Heavy heavy heavy for a small sedan, but it's still responsive.  The weight really helps out with keeping a quiet smooth ride.  It also has somewhere in the neighborhood of 12 airbags for passenger safety no matter where you're sitting.  This helped me make the switch from a big, safe Jeep to a smaller, safe Audi.

Complaints: When my wife steals the dash mounted cup holder for her own drink, and I'm forced to use one of the cup holders under the center arm rest.  This prohibits the use of that oh so comfortable adjustable leather rest for my lazy elbow.  There's no real storage outside the glove box and the small center rest compartment.  However this could be considered a good thing, because there's no room for the normal junk I would throw around in my other cars, thus promoting a cleaner environment.  Zero to sixty mph is a mediocre 8.6 seconds.  Though not exactly a bus, it's not outstanding either.

I am a high-fi junky.  I love home theatre equipment as well as fancy car audio toys.  Normally this car would already be at the shop, or myself under the dash, yanking out the old factory radio, putting in something fancy and pricey.  I must say I'm pleasantly surprised with the Bose stereo/cd player.  It's got the right amount of bass for the wife's techno, and the perfect amount treble, midbass, and everything else for my rock-n-roll.  I see no need in mucking up the interior of this car to put in the extra subwoofers, amplifiers, tweeters, new head unit, blah blah blah.  This will do just fine as it is for some time.

The sunroof is quiet enough to have a phone conversation at highway speeds.  The highway noise is also eerily quiet.

The only thing I'm considering adding (eventually) is a PES Supercharger.  This bumps the horsepower up to 300, and the zero to sixty times down to 5 seconds.  It's very well behaved when your poking around town, but it's always there when you need it.  More on that later, maybe ;-)

The interior is out of site, the ride is as smooth as glass, the engine is ready to roar, and the exterior is as sleek as a baby's bum.
