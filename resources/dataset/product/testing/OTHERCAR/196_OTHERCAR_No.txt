            I bought my 1999 Rodeo used in March of this year with 25,000 miles.  I loved the shape which I considered more attractive than any other SUV.   I researched for months before deciding on the Rodeo.  But most important is the fact that less than a month ago I heard a sound as if it was in third gear or idling too fast.  The next day as soon as I started it and put it into reverse, the throttle went wide open and it went straight back into a tree, which then knocked it into a gear and it went forward throttle wide open into my house.  The brakes were being used the whole time but wouldn't stop the car.  The car is totaled now and a mechanic found that something was making the throttle go wide open.  Now my insurance company is investigating as to why this happened.  I have read similar fast idle stories in Edmund's Town Hall and in my opinion I am afraid this may happen to someone else.  I had only put 7,000 miles on it before this happened.  I was lucky that it didn't happen while I was going down the road.  Everyone please be leery about buying any used Rodeo. <br><br>
