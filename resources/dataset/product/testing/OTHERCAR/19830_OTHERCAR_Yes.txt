            A most enjoyable car to drive!  When looking for a replacement for my old Buick I thought there were only two product lines in my price range to choose from - Chevy Caprice and Ford Crown Victoria.  Then I saw the 96 Impala SS and fell in love!  This car outperforms big-block 60's cars of similar size and weight, corners on rails and has room for 5 comfortable people.  Available in 3 colors, I looked for 2 months to find a Dark Green-Gray Metallic one.  The only engine available is the 260 HP LT1, based on the Corvette engine, but with iron heads (and a few other differences).  Stock it was around 15.5 in the quarter, with very minor mods I am turning in 14.7 at 93 mph on stock 4 season radials.  I also autocross race it and run in open road races in Nevada at 130 mph with the cruise control set in leather wrapped comfort!<br><br>
