            I have owned a few cars in my life, mostley Pontiac's, but this car has been the best deal so far. Ya, its 3yrs old when we bough it, but low milage, and its got everything you could possibly want. Power everything, keyless entry, rear defogger and more.

This is a great little car, gets good mileage, bout 28MPG, plenty of room, I'm 6'3&quot;   and lots of trunk space. 60/40 split folddown in most.

I am enjoying this car more than the rest that I have had. IF you are looking for a car, that is simple, yet has everything you want, this is a good buy.<br><br>
