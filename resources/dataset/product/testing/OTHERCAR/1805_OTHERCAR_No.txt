            I've always owned GM cars, usually Chevrolet, I purchased my '99 olds when I was not able to find the camaro I wanted. I had decided since that wasn't available I would purchase a nice 4 door vehicle that perhaps I could avoid speeding tickets with.I purchased my oldsmobile with plenty of warranty remaining and was apalled by the service I recieved when I first needed work done on my car. The hours they provide are working hours, no offer of transportation was made for me because of my work hours, I don't start until 11am. This was at every dealership I called, no one would take the car in on a saturday, they told me because they could not rely on their mechanics to show up!! I finally made arrangements with my work to take the car in during the day. I showed up at the dealership and was ignored for 15 minutes before I finally was able to get someones attention to complain. The second time I needed service I had to speak to the owner of a different dealership to get them to take my car in on a saturday. I will never buy another oldsmobile because of the horrible service I recieved while trying to get work done on my car that shouldn't have gone wrong to begin with, it was a brand new car,I shouldn't have had to replace the brakes at 20,000. The abs went out shortly after that. I am a person who takes excellent care of my vehicles and when I was younger had 2 cars that I ran for well over 200,000 miles, most of which were put on by me, I ended up getting rid of them only because I was starting to make more money and wanted nicer cars to drive. I will stick with chevorlet after I am done with this oldsmobile, Sure you have problems with any brand you buy, but at least the service you recieve from chevrolet is the best around.<br><br>
