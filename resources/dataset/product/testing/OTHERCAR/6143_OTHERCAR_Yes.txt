            So many rappers talk about the famous Impala.  So when I visited a relative at a rental car dealership, I had to take one for a drive.  Of course, the new 2000 model is quite different from those of old.  Gas mileage has gotten a little better and the body style has changed dramatically.

I found the Impala to be a nice looking car, but it is nothing overly impressive.  When I first saw it, I have to admit that I was not impressed.  It does not look like a bad car, just not a sleek family car like I imagined.

The drive was definitely above average.  Beats riding around in most four-doors.  I do feel that the Impala lacks power that comes in several more expensive cars that I have had the privilege to drive, but in no way would I say that this car is powerless.  

The seats are comfortable and it is a very easy car to drive.  The ride is quiet and it handles curves almost flawlessly.  So, while I wouldn't say that the new Impala is the best car I have recently driven, it surely competes with other similar cars on the market in both price and performance.  Above-average is probably a slight understatement, but incredible would be giving a little more credit than the Impala is due.<br><br>
