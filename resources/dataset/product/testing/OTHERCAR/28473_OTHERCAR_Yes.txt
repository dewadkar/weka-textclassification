            It seems that the three opinions already here come from people who've test driven a Volvo V40, but who don't actually own one.  As a first-time user of this site, I find this a bit discouraging.  I've owned a V40 for six months now, and it's been nothing but terrific.

It is not, as one reviewer asserts, a Ford Escort.  Ford is now Volvo's parent company, but that wasn't the case when the V40 was designed, or when it made its European debut four years ago.  Coming from a family of Volvo owners (this is our seventh in a row), I can safely say that this car is as much a Volvo as any other.  Reviewers mention handling issues, probably because the car understeers by design, a feature which one instantly comes to appreciate when a heavy load is carried.  

I could write endlessly about the wonderful features of the V40: safety, comfort, reliability, efficiency, and price are all great.  I don't care about how a car looks; I care about getting from place to place safely, sometimes with lots of stuff in tow, and always with the ability to fit into regular parking spaces.  So for me, this is a perfect car.  The trunk is more than adequate for usual purposes.  When my friend moved into a new apartment, we moved her possessions in three or four trips: the back seats fold down, and the back deck lifts out.  If a third person is riding with you, leave one seat up and fold the other two down.  With all the seats up, there's room for three adults in the back.  

If you are one of the many people who view cars as fashion statements, you'll have an opinion of how the V40 looks.  Growing up, I was always told that Volvos were &quot;boxy.&quot;  Early Volvos tend not to have any straight lines, and remind me of soap bubbles.  Modern ones are, to me, a generic-looking mix of curves and angles.  The V40 looks like what it is: a modern Volvo wagon, fitting Volvo's idea of a &quot;compact&quot; car (which is everyone else's idea of a mid-size car, it seems).  If you like the way it looks, great.  If you don't, and this stops you from buying one, great... more Volvos for those of us who care about what really matters.

If I could change anything about the V40, I'd offer a manual transmission (the rest of our cars have one, and I'm used to it) and a slightly larger gas tank.  Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing.
