            We bought our Neon about 5 years ago.  We did our research.  Consumer reports rated this car a "best buy." They were wrong in this case.

We had problems from the beginning.  First(within the first 2,000 miles) there was a horrible squeak from the front brakes.  We took it in a number of times over the life of the 36,000 mile warranty.  Each time the mechanics told us that it is normal for those type of brakes.  We later had to replace those "normal" brakes after the warranty.

At 24,000 miles it blew a head gasket.  We took it in under warranty.  At that time they replaced an electrical harness, and catylitic converter.

At 38,000 miles things started to get worse.  Between 38,000 and 50,000 the horn shorted out, the turn signals failed to lock in position, the A/C quit, another head gasket blew with a warped head, the transmission needed work, and the brakes were finally replaced.  We had most of it repaired.

At 104,000 miles the car was on its death bed.  Yet another head gasket blew, and the A/C compressor quit.

The heater concentrated the heat on the drivers side, so when it was really cold the passenger had to freeze of the driver had to roast. The slightest bump would knock the wheels out of alignment.  From the time we drove it off the lot to the time we sold it "as is," we would have been better off with a $500 junker.  At least that way we would not have owed money.
