            When we found out we were expecting #3, we decided the Grand Am had to be upsized.  I was set on an SUV, but let DH do the shopping.  He came home with this instead.  At first I was furious.  "Do I look like the mini van type?" Was my first question.  

Less than three days after we bought this thing, we drove from NC to TX.  I was thanking him all the way there for not listening to me.  We had plenty of room, and plenty of storage space. 

 Also the size was good because I get rather intimidated riding between semi trailers!!  The large gas tank is a plus also.  We only had to stop twice on the way to Tx (1300 miles).  We average around 480- 500 miles on a tank which is 25 gallons.  Approx 18-20 MPG which to me seems pretty good for a mini-van.  

A month later I drove myself and the kids down to Disney World and was again thankful for the van.  We folded down the backseat (1 handle fold down is wonderful!!!) and slept there when we got tired.  I was 6 months pregnant and had a almost 3 year old and 15 months old, and we fit comfortably.

The automatic sliding door is a blessing when you are carrying a baby, groceries, and trying to keep track of a roaming toddler.  

This van has made three round trips from NC to DC, two trips to TX, 1 trip to FL, and one trip cross country.  In less than a year we over maxed out our warrenty (3 year/36,000 miles).   We change the brakes before every trip, just to be safe, so I have never had any problems with them, they stop well, and within a reasonable distance.  

I am a very cautious driver, with three small children, I have to be, but living in Hawaii I am likely to get myself killed driving like I do.  Everyone here drives crazy.  My husband has no problems manuvering this van in and out of traffic, the get up and go seems to be comparable to most vehicles it's size, maybe a but faster "off the line".  It is no where near my Grand Am, but what do you expect?  I notice it does much better if you keep it tuned up regularly.  (Something about the spark plugs, I don't know I'm not a mechanic!).  

I like the storage under the passanger seat, and in the very back.  The air compressor has come in handy a few times when the tires got low.  (Plus it pumps up bikes and basketballs- a bonus with kids!)

The only problem I have with this van (other than a longer warrenty would be nice), is that I have a hard time parking it.  My husband parks with ease, but he can drive anything.  I am used to small vehicles and have scuffed this thing up pretty well trying to park in spaces I had no business parking in.  

I have removed and put in all the seats by myself, (although I would not recomend removing or putting the bench seat in by yourself, I scuffed up the inside).  I have never tried to re-arrange the seats, but I am told you can.  

Overall, I'm glad he chose this instead of an SUV.
