            We bought our 1993 Altima GXE new in the US and shipped it to Germany 3 years later. This is THE most reliable car, which is especially important because we have to order parts from the US.  This car has been driven on the European Autobahns for the last 4 years and will be shipped home with us in 2 years.  We intend to keep it until it can absolutely go no further! We expect an easy 200,000 miles of travel. There has been only routine maintenance (oil, filters, brakes) until this, our 7th year together when we are making normal parts replacements for a car with 94,000 miles on it. The original five year battery lasted 6 years.  The original starter lasted 94,000 miles. It has been driven at high speeds with excellent handling, response and braking capabilities. 

This car has ZERO rust even through 3 years of beach living, then 4 of heavily salted roads.  The white paint is still in excellent condition, despite not having been garage kept.  The interior upholstery is in like new condition and the custom mats have held up well.

The trunk is very big for a car this size, though the lip comes up a little bit too high for anything larger than a computer box.  Items that would easily for in the roomy space are difficult to get into the trunk because of this design.  A bonus is the fold down arm rest in the back seat that opens to the trunk.  We have loaded items such as skis, lumber, and a 8x10 roll of carpet into the car comfortably.
