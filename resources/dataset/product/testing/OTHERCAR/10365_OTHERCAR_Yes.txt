            My husband and I purchased a brand new Kia Sephia in August of 1998.  We liked it's sporty look, and it's great price!  We wanted something reliable, since we had (at the time) a four year old son.  And of course we wanted something that was great on gas.  Our son is now six, and our daughter is nine months, and we still love this car!  It has plenty of room inside for us, and the trunk is spacious enough for stroller and two weeks worth of groceries!  And best of all, it is still great on gas (especially with the recent gas price increase!).

Another great aspect of this car is service.  We had a few minor problems (a window molding came loose, and a wire came detached from its socket) and also our 15,000 mile service, all which were repaired speedily.  The dealer shuttled us home, and came back and picked us up when the car was ready!  Everything was covered by the warranty, except for the 15,000 mile service.  Also, the night when the wire had come loose, the car wouldn't start, and we called the Kia 800 emergency number.  A tow truck was on the scene in less than thirty minutes, brought us home and brought the car to the dealer, at no cost to us.  I was picked up the next morning at my home to get my car, which was already repaired!

The only negative opinion I have on the car is paint quality.  If you drive alot on the highway, the nose gets quite a few nicks.  But I was told my many friends with different cars that this is an all around problem unless you get a protective coat on the paint.  

All in all, I would recommend the Kia Sephia to anyone who wants a reliable, low priced family vehicle.<br><br>
