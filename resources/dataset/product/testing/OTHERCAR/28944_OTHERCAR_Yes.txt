            Mini SUVs are bound to be, if they aren�t already, the next big thing.  What could be better than combining the height and good looks of a full-size truck with the improved fuel economy and compact size of a small sedan?  Not much if you look at the proliferation of budget priced mini SUVs currently offered  by many of the worlds largest auto makers.  There are so many good choices; from the lowly and notoriously unreliable Kia Sportage to the often overlooked and value priced Mazda Tribute, there is no shortage of these new mini trucks (or cars with truck bodies in some cases).

Before the Honda CRV, before the Toyota RAV4 and long before the Hyundai Santa Fe there was the Isuzu Amigo - an arguably cute and capable �baby SUV,� before the term SUV was such an integral part of our modern lexicon.  With its cute looks and fold down rear roof, the Amigo won many fans through a loyal customer base of young girls and some budget minded boys who wanted, at least to pretend, to go off-road.  Curiously the spunky Amigo was dropped from Isuzu�s line up, only to reappear a few years later.  At first the Amigo returned as a new and improved Amigo, later it was dubbed the Rodeo Sport.  

The Rodeo Sport is essentially a 2 door Rodeo with a shortened wheelbase and your choice of a removable soft top or a permanent, black hard top.  And that is really part of the Rodeo Sport�s charm, it can be configured in many different ways. Choices include a 2.2 L 4 cylinder engine or a 205 hp, 3.2 L V-6 with either a 4 speed automatic or 5 speed manual transmission.  . In V-6 form, the Rodeo Sport is exceptionally quick � a 3.2 L V-6 is a lot of engine for a little truck..  Think of the Rodeo Sport as a Jeep Wrangler with a 25 year jump in technology.  The Wrangler feels crude by comparison. Borrowing from some of the Wrangler�s styling cues, the Rodeo Sport looks almost as cool, while delivering modern ride quality and integrity.

Inside the Rodeo Sport is a functional cabin that overlooks luxury in favor of utility.  Seats are comfortable but lack support, especially on the lower part of the seat.  The softness is welcome at first, but longer stints behind the wheel prove to be a little tedious.  Perhaps it�s not the seats themselves, but rather the funny seating position for the driver.  With the driver�s seat pushed all the way back, there is little leg room for those over 5�10� and yet the steering wheel feels too far away.  It�s almost as if they engineered the Rodeo Sport to mimic the driving position found in most Italian cars.  The rear seat has surprisingly ample leg room, especially when considering this is a 2 door, mini SUV.  Wanna talk rear leg room?  The little Rodeo Sport is by far more comfortable than the larger (and older) Jeep Cherokee.  The Rodeo Sport�s rear seat is also very easy to fold down. While the materials inside the Rodeo Sport lack the cheapness found in a vehicle of the Jeep Cherokee  or Kia Sportage�s caliber, there is certainly room for improvement.  Another surprise is the multi-disc CD changer built right into the dash, are you kidding me? The Rodeo Sport is clearly intended for the budget mined, and yet they can offer an in dash CD changer � what�s wrong with Kia, Suzuki, and even the pricier Chevy Trailblazer?  Give me a break.  Isuzu is all about value, and here is one way they prove it.

On the road, this little Isuzu feels like just what it is, a small truck.  Handling is average, the Rodeo Sport is not intended to be a sports car.  When comparing to other mini SUVs, the Rodeo Sport is right in the middle of the pack  - the car based Honda CRV is more stable, while the ancient Jeep Wrangler feels downright pre-historic compared to the Rodeo Sport. On the open highway the Rodeo Sport shines with very little road or engine noise � again, compare this to the fatiguing Jeep Wrangler.  The V-6 is not only powerful, but refined and smooth as well, long trips in this little SUV will not beat you up too terribly.  The two main shortcomings of the Rodeo Sport become obvious only after logging a few hours behind the wheel. First, the short wheelbase may be great for traversing switchbacks, but on the paved road there is just too much busyness in the suspension.  Second, the 4 cylinder Rodeo Sport shares the same 17.7 gallon fuel tank as the thirstier 3.2 L V-6.  The V-6 earns a decent 16 mpg city and 20 highway (remember this is an SUV) but the range is not so great due to the somewhat undersized fuel tank.  Is that minor? Yes, but worth mentioning.

Overall, the Rodeo Sport is worth considering when shopping for a small SUV.  With its muscular good looks and comparatively civilized road manners, the Rodeo Sport outclasses many more expensive SUVs.  Be sure to look for the Rodeo Sport with  granite colored over fenders, the extra toughness will probably appeal to young men, and who can blame them.  Now consider the stellar 10 year / 120,000 mile power train warranty combined with the 5 year / 60,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty and it�s easy to overlook some of this trucks shortcomings.
