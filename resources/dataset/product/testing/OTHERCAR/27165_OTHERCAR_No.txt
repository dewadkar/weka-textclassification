            <i>(Updated for a new gremlin--so what else is new?  Guess that couple of thousand trouble-free miles I'd wished for when I first wrote this thing was just a WEE BIT OPTIMISTIC.)</i>

A previous reviewer described their '98 as the best lemon he/she ever had. That isn't far off the mark in describing our life w/ our '98 GLS sedan. Unlike that reviewer's fortune with their leased VW, we unfortunately BOUGHT our Passat and aren't of the financial class to be able simply toss off a car we're still paying on. The 4-year anniversary is coming up on this car, and it hasn't been a spotless 48 months. Not even close. 

When we bought the car, the big selling point to me had been the driving dynamics of the car and the close sharing of engineering from its cousin, the Audi A4, except in a bigger, more livable form. The fact that we saved a few dollars w/ the VW didn't hurt either.  The A4 had already been on the market for a number of years, so it was reasonable to assume that many of the early gremlins that normally might be part of an all-new model design as the B5 Passat was at the time would be mitigated. Plus, the B5 had been available in Europe for over a year before it was introduced in the U.S. marketplace. Evidently, no one taught the assemblers of our car that lesson. Early problems from Day One were (I'm going on MY memory here, so I'm not accepting any liability for the faultiness of MY personal RAM chips): 

1) anti-freeze 'aromatics' in the vent system, described as 'normal' in 'early break-in usage' in the dealer's double-talk (in other words, too many people complain about it so VW won't fix it because they (a) don't know how, or (b) would have to admit it's worthy of recall and 'we can't be having a recall on a new model, can we? Well, CAN WE?'), 

2) sticking overhead map light switchgear (replaced by dealer under warranty),

3) semi-existent trunk lamp operation (sort of fixed as part of another repair...read on),

4) non-functioning heater (replaced under warranty),

5) poorly seated rear window gasket (lived with, since it doesn't leak; just looks ugly),

6) poor gasket/seal around the power sunroof (again lived with, since it too doesn't leak; but it looks just as bad as the rear window's seal)

At that time, I also noted a number of minor irritants having to deal w/ various interior ergonomic and functional issues which only come to light when actually trying to live w/ a car. Notable was VW's manual seatback adjustment dial and its difficulty in operation while seated, both in the effort to get the thing turning and in my bodily contortions in trying to wedge myself in some sort of leverage position in order to just reach the #@!!&**## dial to begin with.  It's much easier to operate the blasted thing STANDING outside the car, as long as it's not raining and you don't mind hopping in and out after each twist in getting that seat back JUST RIGHT. Or just simply live w/ the seatback incline as the wife likes it (sigh). 

Also irritating to me was the driver's seatbelt, specifically the latch next to the center armrest; it had this nasty habit of disappearing from arm's reach whenever you wanted to buckle up (which, according to the laws in this state on mine, is anytime I feel like driving). Fortunately over time and use this went away as the materials for the belt latch seem to have retained a better position memory. Oh, and getting use to the trunk latch in the glovebox took a bit (my wife likes to leave the box locked--just use the key fob, hubby), and the logic of it's placement still escapes me given that if anyone ever were to break into the passenger compartment of the car, the fold-down rear seat would give the thief ready access to trunk anyways, locked glovebox or not. Seems to me there were one or two more issues, but since I don't remember what exactly they are, I've either gotten used to them or they must've not been all that important to begin with. 

HOWEVER, over time, a new set of glitches have occurred to occupy my irritated psyche: 

1) electronics management unit failure (one of the computers, I'm told, replaced by the dealer under warranty). Messed up the trip computer in the dash, fouled w/ the radio as well, as well as the dome light in the passenger compartment (don't ask me how...I don't understand it myself). Upon replacement, the glitch in the trunk light was fixed; well, for a time anyways. My wife tells me that the light has been acting up yet again,

2) resetting factory radio (loved to lose all the presets; replaced by us w/ an aftermarket Nakamichi unit; initially it lost the presets once or twice, but hasn't done so again in over a year after another shop redid the previous shop's shoddy install, knock wood), 

3) premature failure of the poorly designed oem Continental tires w/ less than 30k miles (replaced by us, courtesy of the Tire Rack--great guys (yeah, a blatant plug, but one that's sincere and well-deserved)).  Note that one negative effect with going to a different tire (Bridgestone RE950s) was that an oscillation effect occurs w/ the wind pattern around the sunroof when in the full-open position.  In my opinion, a small price to pay for the handling upgrade, and the absence of the irritating Continental tire squeal at even the lowest speeds around corners, 

4) exorbitant brake replacement cost, not understood until the dealer explained that if factory VW rotors showed any warpage and need remachining, they simply toss them and replace w/ new ones because the factory rotors are nearly impossible to machine properly. This means to Joe Consumer a dealer brake job of $500 per axle (figuratively speaking, of course, since there's no real axle at either end of the car), 

5) Tiptronic brain fade, or 'you really didn't want to use that gear between second and fourth, did you?' (fixed by dealer under warranty), 

6) turbocharger failure (the big one so far, but not the last in the list; replaced by dealer under the generous powertrain warranty, though not without some fight--let me say that it unfortunately pays to have the dealer do ALL the routine maintenance work just so they have the records that PROVE you've had all that routine maintenance work done. Suffice to say that it was good that the Firestone oil filter on the car at the time backed my "story" that I had Firestone do all my oil changes--not mentioning that they were cheaper and were open on Saturdays, of course), 

7) suspension failure of the the bushings on the control arms at the driver's side front corner, and on the front anti-roll bar at that same corner (requires replacement of the affected suspension components--the bushing themselves can't simply be replaced, apparently; repair pending on my nickel, depending on how frequent my wife's complaints become over the suspension THUNK). All this on a car w/ less that 36K miles on the clock at the time of failure. This is where that wimpy 24/24 bumper-to-bumper warranty really sucks, 

8) continual failure of the dreaded CV boots (a 'routine maintenance item' not covered by warranty, sucker). VW must make them out of silk or tissue paper. I'm a city slicker and don't go off-roading in this car. Really I don't. Twice in 40k miles at the passenger front corner, 

8) key fob failure (replaced by us). Did you know that one of those things was $57, before tax? Weird how it failed, too. Turned on the alarm with it, then pressed a second time to check...nothing. Did the usual 'run to the Radio Shack' battery replacement stuff before breaking down and buying the new one, in case you're wondering. What a way to waste a Saturday. Good thing another VW dealer had THEIR parts department open on the weekend, else I'd have to waste a part of MY work week chasing a new one down from my usual dealership, 

9) an oil leak, due to the valve cover gasket failure, and a couple of other seal failures (drivetrain warranty fix, thankfully).  Most irritating to me was that when I was going over the work order paperwork received from the dealer, they wrote in to RECHECK this repair the NEXT TIME the car's in for service!  Not sure of the QC of your work, guys?  Also, I'm still working on the cleanup of the grease slick on the garage floor.  Hope EPA doesn't find out about it.

<b>NEW (1/24/02):

10) ANOTHER OIL LEAK, at the oil pan gasket.  The car was brought back to the dealer to diagnose a complaint of excess petroleum fumes coming off the engine, originally believed by yours truly to be exhaust gases somehow escaping the car at the front end.  Turns out it was the leak that was getting oil on some hot components, and that was the odor we were getting into the passenger compartment via the ventilation system.  Sharp nose of mine, that; couldn't tell the difference between burnt oil and spent gasoline.  Regardless, the smell was obnoxious, and contributed to a wave of nausea for almost everyone riding in the car.  Hmmm...seems I remember a certain dealership PULLING the oil pan before they would replace a certain failing turbocharger, as documented in a certain Item 6 above.  Guess that QC I was so irate about in a certain Item 9 is indeed QUITE QUESTIONABLE.  Most certainly.  Grrr.</b>

I also seem to remember a complaint about a gasoline smell, but since the car hasn't gone *POOF*, we're still among the living, and I don't notice it anymore, I assume this somehow corrected itself (DOUBLE knock wood). And there's that poorly designed trunk opening, where any and all water sitting on the trunk lid will roll off into the trunk when the lid is opened too quickly to the full open position (which by doing so doesn't allow for that water to trickle off and be caught by the opening's surrounding rain gutter when you SLOWLY raise the lid--amazing how often you tend to forget this fact when you're standing outside your car in a downpour). There have been other issues w/ the VW dealer that have not been pleasant as well; delays in repair work (the car's been 'overnighted' too often), parts not in stock, pricey maintenance when compared to dealers of other makes we've owned, both previous and currently. Yada, yada. 

Best lesson about life w/ this car: Never to have bought one? 

Seriously, you have to have a sense of humor about this car, for sure, and a STRONG sense of patience. The thing does have a very likable, charming personality, and though it's a flawed one, who's isn't? There's no sense of appliance w/ the Passat--probably due to the problems, say the cynics, but I think it's more than that.  It's unlike so many Hondas or Toyotas I know (and have owned). I hate this car, and yet amazingly I still love it too. Despite the list of complaints rattled off, this car's still a delight to drive hard into a corner with, even if it could use a serious kick in HP (since the drivetrain warranty has proven it's worth AND need, no engine mods are in its future as long as we own this car). 

It's communicative steering and suspension, even it's Tiptronic slushbox, make our FWD Passat a reasonably decent driver's car (especially once the oem tires were replaced, but even before it wasn't too dreadful). Of all of the problems, perhaps the only irk that really grates is the suspension bushings, which in my mind (and in those of many others I've spoken with, except those individuals who are officially affiliated w/ VW of North America) SHOULD NOT have failed in so short a time, though I hear it's an issue with A4 owners as well.  Also, I have a couple of friends who also own the B5 (newer than our '98, however), and they have not had anything close to the problems we've had (Homer Simpson 'DOUH!').  But now that the cracked windshield has been replaced, life w/ Passat will hopefully return to uneventful bliss for a couple of thousand more miles, discounting a few untimely suspension thunks (well, I'm allowed to hope, aren't I? Well, AREN'T I? <b>(obviously, the answer is NO)</b>).

Now, if I could only get VW to kill those embarrassing 4Motion radio spots...they ALONE are enough to make a Passat owner want to tape up the 'FOR SALE' sign.
