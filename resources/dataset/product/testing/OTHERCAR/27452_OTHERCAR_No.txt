            The neon was actually a vehicle that was inherited by me in a way.  When I began to date my girlfriend, she already had owned this car for five years.  After 39 months the air conditioner went out with a really ugly sound and did not work after that.  The dealer refused to fix it and she did not want to spend the 800 to get it fixed.  The car has leaked water through the back window on the drivers side for about the last year and a half and we have been unable to find anyone to fix it for less than 600 bucks. In 2/2000, the check engine light went on when she was in Iowa and the dealer replaced some sensors and some other parts that she did not authorize them to replace. After fighting with the dealer for over an hour, they finally knocked off half the price which was still 500 bucks.  Ever since then, the radio has only worked occasionally.  Some five star service that was.  Everything about the car is cheap, from the rattles and shakes.  In fact we both call it the beatermobile.  Then last May, with only 70,000 miles on it the transmission went bad.  1500 bucks later it was fixed after having to pry it off of the rusted undercarriage.  The last straw came last week when the check engine light came on and the car stalled at a stop light.  I was able to get it restarted and get it back home.  That same day we went and got a wonderful 1997 Nissan Maxima for 15000 bucks that is leaps and bounds above the old neon.  We are now trying to sell it for 1000 bucks just to get the eyesore out of our sight.  When we told the dealer about it they wanted no part of it.  I am so glad to be rid of that money pit.  Buyers beware, you are better off to get a three year old Toyota or Nissan, any money that you save will go to repairs on a car like this.  It is amazing that they still make them.<br><br>
