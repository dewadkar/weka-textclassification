            The car of your dreams!  What can I say but WOW!  The Toyota Celica is two door sports car that has a sleek body frame to it.  It's equipped with a high-tech 160hp engine and 6 speed transmission.  I just was recently in my friends Celica and the performance was absolutely amazing.  The engine is so quite you don't even know if it's running.  Plus this car sticks to the road on those sharp turns and winding roads.  This cars acceleration is phenomenal, thanks to it's size and powerful engine it can escalate from 0-100km in about 7 seconds, leaving everyone in the dust.  The seats to this car are leather settings and are extremely comfortable.  However, the back is not as roomy as the Solara but what can you expect for a sports car.  It comes with all the standard features such as, power window, power door locks, built in cd player and cassette player.  You also have the option of upgrade the interior so it has marble dash, and a sunroof.  Also, the sound system in this car is similar to the Solara and has I think 4 JBL speakers that has amazing sound quality.  Overall, this car is well worth your money especially if your looking for a new car or a graduation present for your teenagers.  I know that when I have enough money this is the car that I'll be purchasing.  Here are some features that come with the celica which I copied from the toyota handout.
