            We purchased this van used in 1998. It looked as though it was very well cared for. We needed a larger vehicle(have 3 kids!) and had to trade in a Honda Odyssey. Although the Honda was such a great car, it just wasn't big enough.
After we drove off in our Astro van it wasn't long after that we started having problems. Nothing too major, but enough to frustrate us.
I do have to say that this vehicle can haul around so much stuff. The engine is strong and it still has tons of power with a full load.
But that's where it all ends.
Every little bump in the road makes this van sway.
The brakes are the worst. Currently, there is a recall on the ABS, but there is still no fix available. So we paid for a safety feature that doesn't and can't work.
Bottom line, I would say this van is powerful, yet very crude and most importantly, unsafe.
We are just waiting for Honda to improve yet again, on their van and we'll go for that.<br><br>
