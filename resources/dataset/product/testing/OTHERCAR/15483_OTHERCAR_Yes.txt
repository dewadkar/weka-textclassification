            This is a great camera, digital still and movie pictures that will fit on a floppy disk.  There are other great cameras out there, but the ability for this device to save all images on a floppy is what makes it the bargain of the century.  Do not hesitate to purchase this camera for your business and personal needs.

This camera has the smart flash feature, whereas it will only flash if needed. You can override this with the touch of a button.  Also has several exposure options as well as movie ability. 

There is not a better value in digital cameras.  Sure, there are cheaper ones, but nothing that will suit your needs for years to come!<br><br>
