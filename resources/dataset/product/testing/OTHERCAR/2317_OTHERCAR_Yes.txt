            This is a really roomy small car, ( this from a 225lb 5'11&quot; adult male) I took the car on a trip from NY Metro area all through the state of W. Virginia  and didn't suffer any discomfort.  The car got a whopping 35mpg and handled all types of road conditions.  Traveling at 75 &amp; 80 mph was not uncommon during the trip and the terrain went from level to quite mountainous.  

My traveling companion on the trip, owns a Ford Crown Victoria and was also impressed with the comfort and roominess of the Kia.

The CD audio system has a nice sound and the overall operation of the stereo system was user friendly.  

After the first 7,000 miles tune-up time, the car hadn't used any oil at all and it was still clean as new.  I find the manufacturers attention to details was far greater than is to be expected for an auto in this price range.  I would definitely recommend it to my friends and to anyone who is looking for quality and comfort in a small car. <br><br>
