            December 1998 my Toyota Celica caught on fire and blew up.  After test driving too many cars to count I finally decided on a green five speed, two wheel drive, two door half cloth top Amigo with a sunroof.  I have had the Amigo a little more than a year and have had absolutely no problems at all with it.  The seats are comfortable and easily adjusted.  The back seat is roomy and comfortable but as with all two door vehicles the back seat can be difficult for an adult to get into.  The back seat also lays down if you need to load a large item.  I have loaded everything from bicycles to 30 bags of fertilizer in the back of my Amigo.  The cloth top can be extremely difficult to zip in cold weather but I have not removed the cloth top completely yet.  The sunroof is easily opened or removed and I have had no leakage problems with the sunroof at all.  

I was surprised to find three power ports in the Amigo.  This is really handy because sometimes my boyfriend works on a laptop computer while I'm driving.  The ashtray is really too small for a smoker to use but it works.  

I just returned from a long trip and had no trouble with the Amigo at all. It handles just as well in busy city traffic as it does on rural roads.   The Amigo handles and corners well; more like a car than an SUV but it has the added bonus of having lots more head and leg room than a car.

The only complaints I have is that gas mileage is not too wonderful.  I would say somewhere around 17 to 20 miles per gallon and also I often wish the Amigo had a little more power.  

Another added bonus is that my car insurance with a 1998 Isuzu Amigo is cheaper than the car insurance on a 1991 Toyota Celica with over 100,000 miles on it.

Overall, the Amigo has been a very reliable, dependable car and for the price I don't think I could have found any other automobile that would even come close to having the benefits and perks that came with this car. I would recommend this car to anybody that is looking for a reliable, inexpensive, fun automobile.  <br><br>
