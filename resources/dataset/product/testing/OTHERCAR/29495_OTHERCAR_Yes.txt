            I was dying to go digital. I'm one of those amateur shutterbugs who is too lazy to regularly drop my film off. And with the expense of film, it tends to limit your willingness to press that shutter button. Well a digital camera solves all of that. I experiment a lot more now with light and angles. And you see the results immediately. And if your friends and family are as connected as mine, it much more convenient to drop your shots in their inbox instead of the photomat.

What You Get:

The DC240 is a 1.3 Megapixel digital camera. Its a great camera for snapshots, but it's not upgradeable like a SLR camera.

1.3 Megapixel CCD
8 MB Compact Flash Card
6x zoom (3x Optical and 2x Digital)
USB connectivity (or Serial)
Composite Video Out
B &amp; W, Sephia, and Border Effects
Easy Colorful User Interface
Good PC (or Mac) software
Batteries and charger

You can set the quality of the shot to the standard 640x480 or the high 1280x960 (1.3 Megapixel). If your pictures are going to stay mostly digital, then the standard setting is perfect for distributing your shots via email or a web page, but you really want the high setting if the shots are going to be printed.

I picked mine up at Best Buy, and it was a picture that a customer brought in that convinced me to buy this model. The customer took a high quality shot of Epcot Center with it's Millennium decor at night, and printed it on a standard piece of 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; paper with an ink jet printer. It was awesome. And photo paper looks even better!

How It Performs:

Kodak did a great job designing the UI on the DC240. It's super easy to use. I got home, and I was snapping shots in an instant. Kodak was nice enough to give you 4 AA Alkaline batteries to start using while you were charging the 4 AA NiMH batteries. And don't think that you can charge the batteries in the camera. They can only be charged in their charger. Further they power supply is a seperate accessory. You can get it with their accessory pack which includes a nice carrying case, 4 more AA NiMH batteries, the power supply, and some photo paper.

So then I installed the software on my PC, and started to transfer my pictures to be displayed on my monitor. Kodak's PC software is sweet. It has plugins so you can view the images files (jpegs) on the camera straight from Explorer as if it were a hard disk. And amazingly my shots weren't half bad.

I had previewed the shots on the LCD display, but it's hard to judge quality there. The LCD allows you to conveniently frame your shot, or you can turn it off to save juice and use the physical viewfinder. Yep, this baby has a viewfinder unlike some other manufacturers. Combine that with the wonderful 3x optical zoom, and very few shots are out of your reach.

So Why Not a Five:

Because it doesn't fill all of my amateur needs. I'm far from a professional, but I do have some simple needs. And one of them is a reasonably fast shutter. Well this is the Achille's Heel of many digital cameras. The CCD technology used in affordable digital cameras is slow. It makes action shots almost impossible. And I'm not talking Nascar action either. This camera would have blurred athletes at this years Olympic Men's 50km Walk. And those guys weren't all that fast.

Is it a Buy:

It's a great price and a great product, but it won't replace your old 35mm. I love mine and use it all the time because it's digital. I would suggest it as a great entry into the digital realm. Plus it had all of the features that I was looking for.<br><br>
