            We bought a '92 Dodge Caravan last year as we have 2 children and we got a good deal.  So far it has turned out to be the best buy we have made.  We have had virtually no problems with it except for a minor electrical one (if you have your fan go out, let me know and I will tell you what is wrong!)  It drives great and is great for trips.  We got another seat to replace the two captains chairs in the middle, one of the ones with the built in carseats for children and it reclines.  We have the extended version and I would recommend anybody getting a minivan to get the extended one, the little bit of room makes a world of difference for putting luggage in the back!  It drives great, gets decent gas mileage and is great for hauling kids and dogs around.  =  )<br><br>
