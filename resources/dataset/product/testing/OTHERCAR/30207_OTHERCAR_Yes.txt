            I use to own a 1995 Isuzu Pick-up truck.  For a year and a half, it was very dependable.  I put 20,000 miles on it in the time I owned it.  I used it countless times to haul furniture and other things from work to home, and other various places.  I totaled the car, because I fell asleep at the wheel early one morning, so I had to move on and by another truck.  The accident was very bad, and I walked away from it with only a scratch on my ear.  I would not have been as fortunate if I was in another vehicle.

It had manual transmission, and was a lot of fun to drive.  I could spin the tires anywhere.  I could get the truck up to 60 miles per hour, very quickly.  I was also able to, &quot;Pop a Wheelie&quot; or get the front end totally of the ground, safely, while driving.  

Once I start college, I plan to sell my new truck, and buy another little truck like this, as it was very economical and fun.<br><br>
