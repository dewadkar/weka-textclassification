            Since Jbratek never even drove the SLK 230, he could not possibly comment with authority on the car's transmission, acceleration and handling.  Thus, the only explanation for his opinions being so accurate is that he plagiarized published remarks made by experts.

The 2000 SLK which I purchased in October 1999 was the first sports car
or quasi sports car I have ever owned.  The closest I previously came to
the real thing was a 1990 Honda Prelude SI.  Based on memory, the SLK
handles better than the Prelude did when new, but not by much.

The consensus is that the SLK is markedly slower than and does not handle
as well as competing vehicles such as the Boxter.  That is of little importance to me, though, for I have no place to go where the car's
performance can truly be tested.

The SLK's five speed transmission is a joke.  Even the one in my Prelude,
a relatively inexpensive automobile, was much superior.  It does not shift smoothly, and the reverse gear is difficult to engage.

The main reason I purchased the car was because of Mercedes' reputed reliability, and after 11,000 plus miles, I have no real reason to complain on that score.  However, dashboard warning lights have come on at least twice without any reason to do so, and that, of course, necessitated trips to the dealer.  In addition, the air conditioner malfunctioned once.

Jbratek is correct in that if the top in down, the trunk offers little
space.  That problem can be obviated whenever the need arises, though, simply by pressing a button and putting the top up.  When up, the trunk
is very large by sport car standards.

Also, as Jbratek pointed out, the interior is surprisingly roomy, and
due to the retractable metal top, being able to turn an open air vehicle into a coupe in a matter of seconds is a real asset.

The 2000 model debuted in September 1999, and it is already obsolete.
The 2001's hit the dealer showrooms in June 2000 if not earlier.  Not only has the five speed been replaced by a transmission with six gears, but there is now a choice of two engines, the six cylinder found in the 320E sedans as well as the supercharged four.  Adding insult to injury (mine) is the fact that the MSRP price has been reduced approximately
$2,000.00
