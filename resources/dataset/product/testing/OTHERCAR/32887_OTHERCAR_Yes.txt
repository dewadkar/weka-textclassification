            The S300 is everything that I wanted in a snapshot camera; and more.  It's small size and sturdy construction means you can take it everywhere.  It's quality photos it takes means you will use it everywhere.  Look elsewhere if you want the features of a SLR camera; but this is the camera if you want no hassle snaps.

You pay for the Elph's small size - and it is worth it.  On a recent trip to Korea, my friend and I both took our new digital cameras.  He had a beautiful Fuji with a long lens that took great photos.  However, I'm sending him my photos.  His camera stayed in the hotel room while I always kept my Elph in my coat pocket.  

I researched long and hard before I decided on the S300.  It was originally off my list because it required a proprietary battery and it was expensive.  However, I could find no other camera that small without similar price/battery constraints.  Also, I found that the Elph took excellent quality shots.  The Digital Camera Resource site (www.dcresource.com) provided excellent information as well as comparison photographs.

S300 photo quality is very good.  The 2.1 megapixl gives me film-quality photos at 4x6, even after significant cropping.  So, I imagine being able to easily get film-quality photos to 5x7.  Some say up to 8x10, but maybe their opinion of film-quality differs from mine.  4x6 is just fine for snapshots.  Speaking of film-quality, one reason I decided to get a digital camera is because I realized that I didn't have to compromise quality by printing out my photos at home.  Many PhotoShops now provide low cost prints from your digital media (I burn it to CDRW before sending it to COSTCO).  I can now get just the prints I want for $.20 a print.  No waste, no surprises, no expensive photo printers.

Besides great quality snap shots from a tiny camera, the S300 offers 3x optical zoom; video with sound; "photo-stitching" (seamless panoramic shots with provided software); quick USB downloads; a cable for viewing pics on your TV; integrated lens cap; and a great software suite.

I would not want a camera with less than 3x optical zoom.  A digital zoom is irrelevant.  The S300's zoom is easy to use.  As a matter of fact, the whole camera is easy to use, despite its small size.  I usually set it to the automatic mode.  If I want a fill-flash, I set it to manual.  The manual setting is bare bones, but OK for a snapshot camera.

There are a few things that I do not like about this camera.  First, it has a proprietary battery.  You can not go to the drug store to buy a replacement when it discharges.  However, it is a high-quality lithium rechargeable battery.  The camera I got came with an extra battery, so I am happy.  The S300 does not track the batteryï¿½s charge.  It will let you know when it is about to die, but that is too late.  Although the battery will last longer by not using the LCD, I tend to use it a lot because the optical viewfinder is very inaccurate.  

Like most digital cameras, the Elph comes with a small 8MB compact flash memory card.  Practically worthless.  I quickly bought a $55 128MB card.  Also, the camera does not let you know how much memory is available; so, like the battery, your pretty much on your own to guess if you have enough memory left.

Other reviews posted indicated a weak flash.  I do not concur.  It is actually too strong for the close range snapshots that I usually use it for.  I often opt to go flashless (sometimes at the expense of sharpness) to ensure I don't get an overexposed picture.  This camera took great flash shots at close range at near total darkness.  The redeye reduction is not optimal.  It shines a light straight out to constrict pupils.  However, it doesn't work if your subject is not centered.

This is a great camera.  However, it is not complete without buying a 128MB CF card and extra battery.  Shop for deals.  I got mine at COSTCO for $460, including extra battery and 16MB CF card.
