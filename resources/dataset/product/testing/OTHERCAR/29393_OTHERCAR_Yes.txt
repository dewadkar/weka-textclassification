            I have never been one for big cars.  Maybe that is because I am not a car buff.  I need four wheels, electronic windows, an air conditioner and heat.  I have never been one to look at the muscle of a car, never been one to gun the gas pedal and race off to the next red light in a show of my car's strength.

I am basically a little old lady waiting to happen.

Until my husband brought home the <i>2002 Infiniti Q45</i>.  <i>I found love on a two way street.</i> This car, in all its power and glory spoke to me from my driveway.  It whispered sweet nothings, urged me to cheat on my Quest.  It stole my heart, it captured my tune.

<i>This car was my vehicle ~ baby.</i>  

I love the 2002 Q45. I bothered to look at the owner's manual.  I learned that in the heart of the Q45 beat a <b>V8 engine</b>, I yearned to experience the thrust of the <b>340 horsepower.</b>

"Talk to me," the Q45 said.  

And I did.  The <b>voice activation system</b> responded.  The Am/FM/CD/cassette system operated through the tones of my love struck voice.  The air in the Q45 heated up as the power of my voice controlled the climate.  In some models, the navigation system would take you anywhere you wanted to go.

The roomy Q45 gleamed with simple, easy to read instrument panels, and the standard sunroof offered this marriage of car and consumer the promise of a bright tomorrow.  

Reclining, heated seats help warm the cockles of the soul in the sub zero temperatures of the raging Michigan snows.

An optional <b>rear view monitor</b> (camera located near the license plate) offers a closed circuit display of any objects or humans behind the car.

Electric windows, standard ABS, tilt steering wheel, standard adjustable driver's and passenger seats all add to the package that is the Infiniti Q45.

You'll love it, need it, want it.  

Got to have it.

<i>It's your vehicle ~ baby</i>.

All of this from a little old lady waiting to happen.
