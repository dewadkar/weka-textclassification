            Am I the only person who has had quality problems with this camera? I bought mine in January 2002 after reading rave reviews on Epinions. It arrived the night before we left for vacation in the Virgin Islands. It's a sweet little camera, and I had a great time shooting pictures for 6 days, learning how to use all the features. I got some great pictures, even the elusive Perfect Beach Shot. 

On the 7th day it simply stopped working. It froze with the lens partially extended. Pictures could not be displayed either. The green and amber lights flashed when the camera was power-cycled, and the lens-moving mechanism whirred as if it was stuck. After a couple of battery recharges and many on-off cycles I was finally to get the lens to retract. Other than that, the camera was totally dead. 

You know how you always feel guilty when a loved one dies unexpectedly? I thought it might be my fault. Maybe I'd gotten a grain of sand into the lens mechanism, causing the poor little thing to churn itself to death trying to retract. Maybe I'd gotten it damp? I HAD used it under water in the fancy all-weather case. But I had never dropped the camera, set it in the sand, or seen any trace of moisture inside the underwater case. And my subsequent experience has pretty much wiped out any feeling that it was my fault. I loved that camera, and I was very careful with it. It was just defective. 

And Canon's service department is no great shakes either. The camera was still under warranty, of course (one week!), so I called the number on the warranty card and mailed the camera to a service center for repair. It took TWO MONTHS and two or three phone calls before I got it back. When I called I was told they were "waiting for parts," but in the end, they just sent me a brand-new unit. It seems to me that they could (and should) have done that right away rather than letting it sit on the shelf for two months.

So on March 18 I was starting over. The new camera worked, and I used it briefly a couple of times. 6 weeks later I took the camera along in my purse on a trip to California. I took about 20 pictures; then my shiny NEW camera went dead. At first I thought it was the battery (which really does not last long). But no: when I popped in my spare battery, and later the original one recharged, this camera was even deader than the original had been. This time the only thing that happened when I pushed the on-button was the green light flashed. The lens did not even try to extend. I was able to display pictures a couple of times, but even that stopped working fairly quickly. Now it just sits there, totally unresponsive except for the green light. This camera was subjected to absolutely NO rough treatment. It was surrounded by soft items in my purse, was never dropped, dangled by its strap, banged, sat on or any of the things that can happen to a little camera. And, like the first one, it's hardly been used. 

I'm about to send it back to Canon for the second time. I am SO disappointed. I loved the camera when I first got it, but now I'm just sick about the money I wasted. It's been nearly 6 months, and I've only gotten about 2 weeks of use out of it. When I get it back from Canon the next time, I don't think I'll ever trust it again. Was it a mistake to use that underwater case?  Is it safe to carry it in my purse? Maybe the next one will continue to work if I just keep it on a shelf and take it down gingerly for occasional family pictures. But what's the point of getting a camera the size of a deck of cards if you're not going to take it anywhere?

Other than that, it's a great little camera, especially at the current prices. It's lightweight, compact, and cool-looking. It's easy to use, at least for point-and-shoot users, although the manual settings require a lot of button pushing to access. The movie feature is not really useful, but kids love the instant movie-playback. The quick-shoot feature, which allows you to auto-shoot about 2 pix per second as long as you hold the shutter button down, is way cool.  

As other reviewers have mentioned, the battery runs down REALLY fast, especially if you leave the LCD screen on between pictures, and the 8MB chip included with the camera is ludicrously inadequate. If you are pricing cameras, include the cost of a 64MB flash chip and a spare battery in the base price. Some people liked the ZoomBrowser Software, but I'm not impressed. It's probably okay if you use it for all your image management, but it gets confused if you move the image files around using other software (including Windows Explorer). And when it gets confused it tends to lock up or crash.

Service. The telephone part of the support system is not too bad. You have to go through the usual inane voice-mail tree, with the first branch particularly annoying since they make you listen to all the options before you are allowed to press 1 (the option you want). But the wait-queues are short and the operators are polite. It took me about 5 minutes to get through to the guy I actually needed to talk to at the Service Center. He asked a few informed questions and quickly agreed that I needed to send the camera in. He said that it took so long to get my camera back last time because they were in the process of relocating the Service Center, which is not a particularly good excuse, but suggests that it MIGHT be faster this time. Once again, I'm responsible for the postage and insurance. And they insist on taking the time to try fixing the defective camera rather than simply shipping a new one, which would be the efficient and fair way to do it.

In short, I am disappointed with Canon, which has not lived up to its reputation. If it weren't for the quality and service problems, I would recommend this camera. However, under the circumstances, I'm sorry I bought it and would not recommend it to others.
