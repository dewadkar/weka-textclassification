            I own a 1995 Olds Achieva. I bought the car brand new. The price was great, but the workmanship of the interior is somewhat poor. The vents in the doors have fallen out. The lights will not work at times when it rains, especially the taillights. It has the automatic lock on the doors when you put it in gear and that is a great safety feature, but at times when you shut the car off one door or the other will not unlock. The sound system is excellent though. The gas mileage is EXCELLENT! I just wish the workmanship of the interior would have been better. The car drives like a dream though. You couldn't ask for a better ride. I love the gas mileage, but I hate the auto-lock system.<br><br>
