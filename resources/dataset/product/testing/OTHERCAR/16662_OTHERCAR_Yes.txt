            I purchased my 2002 Dakota Quad cab in May of this year. So far I have logged 13k on the odometer. I feel I have had a chance to put it thru its paces so to speak in the last 5 months. I am going to break the review into categories to make it easier to read. 

Overview of the truck
My Dakota is a quad cab 4x4 with the sport plus package, 4.7l v8, and an automatic transmission. The truck has every option but leather seats. 

Interior
The interior of the Dakota is very roomy. The seats are comfortable for long rides. All of the controls are easy to reach and operate. The gauges are very easy to read. My truck has the 40/20/40 split bench with the fold up center armrest. The armrest opens up to reveal a nice storage compartment that has a coin holder in it and also room for some cd&#146s and other stuff. There is also a console on the floor with two cup holders in it. These cup holders are the best cup holders I think I have ever seen. They are adjustable and will hold just about any type of cup or bottle. I have had everything from an 8oz water bottle all the way up to a super big gulp in there and it holds them all. The rear seats also have a similar holder that pulls out from the seat front. The back seats are also very roomy for a truck. I have had people as tall as 6'3" back there without complaint. The rear seats also fold up to haul bulky items inside the cab. My truck also has the infinity sound system, it sounds very nice and the overhead console has the mini trip computer and compass in it as well as a place to put sunglasses. The truck is also very quiet on the road with almost no wind or road noise in the cabin. Overall the Dakota&#146s interior is a pretty nice place to be. 

Exterior
The Dakota looks like a mini Dodge Ram. In my opinion its the perfect size. its not too big like the full size trucks but bigger then the smaller trucks from ford, chevy and the imports. Its not so big that I cant park it in a tight spot or pull into a parking garage like some full size trucks cant. My truck has the sport package, the bumpers and grill are the same color as the body. The sport plus package also includes fog lamps and larger then stock tires and 16&#148 wheels. The bed is a little small but for 90% of what the average person does with a truck its fine. The bed measures 5'3&#148 so it won&#146t hold a sheet of plywood without the tailgate down. The bed light is a nice feature, it does a good job lighting up the bed at night should you need to load anything in it. Why more trucks don&#146t have this feature puzzles me. I also purchased the towing package that included a class IV hitch, 7 wire light harness and heavy duty suspension.

Engine and drive train
There are three engine choices that dodge offers on the Dakota. They are the 3.9l v6, 4.7l v8, and a 5.9l v8. In my opinion the 4.7 is the only motor to get. The v6 really isn&#146t powerful enough for a truck this heavy and it gets the same gas mileage as the 4.7l v8. The 4.7 is almost as powerful as the 5.9 and is better on gas. I drove all three and I couldn&#146t tell the difference between the two v8 motors but the v6 just felt like it struggled moving this truck. I tow a 3500 pound boat and the 4.7 moves it with ease. The 4.7 has plenty of power for passing on the highway. Being a v8 it is a little hard on gad. I am getting about 14 around town and 17 or so on the highway, towing I get around 13. The transmission shifts smoothly, I am not really a fan of automatics but this one seems pretty good at finding the right gear when towing. My truck is also equipped with 3.55 gears and a locking differential. The towing package also included a larger radiator, transmission cooler, engine oil cooler, power steering cooler, 750amp battery, and a 135 amp alternator. Dodge did a very good job setting this truck for towing. 

Ride and handling
For a 4wd truck this truck rides excellent. Its almost car like its so smooth. I always owned 4wd vehicles and this is the best riding one I have ever owned. The sport plus package also included heavier sway bars front and rear so the truck handles very well for a 4wd. When towing the truck is long enough that is doesn&#146t sway and feels very controlled. 

Safety
The truck has drivers and passengers side airbags in the front. It also has height adjusters on the front seatbelts. The power windows have a rear window lockout feature to prevent children from rolling them down when you dont want them to. The rear doors also have child safety locks so prevent children from opening the doors from the inside. There is also three child seat anchors for the new style child seats. The truck had rear wheel abs standard and 4 wheel abs is an option. I have the 4 wheel abs and the truck stops very well under all conditions I have driven it under.
 
Problem areas
The only problem I have had with the truck is the driver&#146s side wiper was misaligned. The dealer fixed it quickly. Other then the wiper there have been no problems with the truck whatsoever. So far it&#146s been very reliable. 


I really like the truck and so far it&#146s been good to me. I tow a 3500 pound boat almost every weekend for long distances sometimes as far as 300 miles each way. The Dakota is a very capable truck. It will haul cargo, people and tow just about anything. 


Update
I now have 26000 miles on the truck and I have not had to bring the truck in for any repairs. So far it is proving to be very reliable and problem free. The only money i have had to put in it has been for regular oil changes and also a set of winter wiper blades. I also had to purchase a new tire because I cut the sidewall driving in a construction area. 

Update
8/6/03
I now have 37000 miles on the truck and im happy to report that I still have not needed any repairs on the truck. At 30k i had to do some regular maint based on my driving habits(city) and towing. I changed the spark plugs, transmission fluid and filter and the differential fluids. I do most of my own car work, the total bill was about $120 for all the needed supplies. The truck is going to need new tires before long, other then that no issues whatsoever.
