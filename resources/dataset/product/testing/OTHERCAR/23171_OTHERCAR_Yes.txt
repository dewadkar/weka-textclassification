            I First Bought My Dodge Pickup Because I Was Selling My MITSUBISHI ECLIPSE
And DESPERATELY Wanted A LARGE SIZE PICKUP, I ALREADY DID THE SMALL TRUCK THING AND IT SUCKED, NO ROOM,NO ZOOM, NO NOTHING BUT FUEL ECONOMY...SO, ANYWAY'S, I BOUGHT MY FULL SIZE DODGE RAM AND IN THE LAST 3 YEARS IT HAS BEEN MY BABY...THE ONLY THING IS I MADE THE MISTAKE OF GETTING THE V6 INSTEAD OF THE V8...BAD MISTAKE...BUT IT IS ONE TOUGH TRUCK AND VERY DEPENDABLE AND LOTS &amp; LOTS OF CAB SPACE....IF YOUR SCARED OF BIG VEHICLES, DON'T BUY THIS ONE BECAUSE SHE IS BIG AND YOU NEED TO BE PREPARED TO GET USE TO THE SIZE, I RECOMMEND THIS TRUCK TO ANYONE, THE ONLY PROBLEM I'VE EVER HAD WAS WITH THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER AND PARTS FOR THIS ON ARE NOT CHEAP,BUT WITH A GOOD WARRANTY, YOU'LL BE FINE, ALSO FUEL ECONOMY IS PRETTY GOOD, I GET ABOUT 25 MILES PER GAL. ON THE HIGH WAY BUT THAT IS WITH THE V6 MODEL (again, i would not recommend this v6) the power sucks, it's just not enough motor for this size of truck i believe...this is a great cowboy up or cowgirl truck but i thinks it's a fine family vehicle also<br><br>
