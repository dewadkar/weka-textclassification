            I bought the Olympus C-4040 over other similar digital cameras because Light and Motion makes an excellent compact underwater housing for it. I have been using a Nikon F-100, but the underwater housing I had was rather bulky.

I am impressed with the range of features. There is an extensive menu which allows you to choose from fully automatic to aperture and speed priority to fully manual. It is very easy to over or under compensate in 0.3 F stop increments. White balance, contrast and sharpness are all adjustable. One of the nice features of the adjustments is that you can set the camera to start with your custom adjustments each time it is powered up, or can set it to open with default settings.

The flash leaves much to be desired. It is relatively weak and set too close to the lens (red eye). The Olympus F-40 external flash is made to work with the electronics of this camera and provides a true TTL exposure. I highly recommend it if you are doing much in the way of flash photography.

The camera comes with a 16 MB Smartcard. This is too small for most practical uses. I use 128 MB cards which give me around 48 super high quality JPEG images. There are no rechargeable batteries packed with the camera. The 1700 Radioshack NMHi batteries allow at least 150 shots per charge(depending on flash use).

The unit connects to my computer via a USB card. It takes about 1 minute to download a full 128 MB Smartcard. I have not used any of the software that comes with the camera because I use Photoshop to crop and adjust each image.

I am very happy with the camera. I took over 300 Photos during a recent trip to Disney World. These included day, night, inside, and low light photos. The only problem I had was due to sun flair shooting into the sun. Adding a polarizing filter helps, but you have to adjust the polarizer looking at the back monitor since it won't affect the viewfinder image.
