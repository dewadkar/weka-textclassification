            I enjoy taking pictures of family and friends on special occasions, and of just about everything when I�m traveling.  Aside from that, I rarely lug a camera around for no reason at all.  I received the Canon Elph Power Shot 100 Digital camera for a birthday gift recently, and I barely put it down.  It�s so easy and fun to use, that I bring it everywhere, and find that I�m taking a ton of pictures and capturing memorable times on film that I would not have before.

<b>Digital Photography</b>
Digital cameras in general have many features that set them apart from their analog ancestors.  First, and most obvious, is that they do not require film.  Pictures are taken and stored on a flash memory card, and then uploaded to a PC.  Once uploaded, pictures can either be printed out with a photo printer, or uploaded to one of many internet sites that allow you to store, share, and order prints.  Many of the top sites include Ofoto, Shutterfly, Photopoint, and Fotolinks.

And Shutterfly, geared for the avid digital photographer:

All newer cameras connect to PCs through a USB port, so hookups are easy.  Uploading can take some time, depending on your connection speed.

<b>Features of the Elph</b>
The Cannon Elph is different from other digital cameras I have used because of its design and ease of use.  The camera is tiny, and is small enough to fit in a shirt pocket.  It is really amazing how they pack such a great camera into the tiny frame.  The  newest model boasts 2.2 megapixel capability, and a 2x zoom lens.  The screen where pictures are viewed is small, but larger enough so you can view it easily.  One complaint I have heard from others is that using the view-finder like a traditional camera causes the screen to get smudged from your nose.  I rarely use the view-finder, I just hold the camera away from my face and use the screen to align my pictures.  Viewing pictures on the camera is easy, and the features are easy to navigate and understand.

<b>Upgrade Me!!</b>
The only complaint that I have is that you need to upgrade the camera right out of the box.  The camera comes with an 8mb flash memory card, which is only big enough to hold about 10 shots.  I immediately bought a 64mb card, which can hold about 50 pictures or so before uploading to my PC.  An extra battery is not essential, but can be helpful if your going to be unable to recharge for long periods of time.  Also, the camera does not come with a case.  I found one designed specifically for the tiny Elph for about $15.

<b>Where to buy?</b>
Just about any electronics retailer.  Amazon carries them for the best prices I�ve seen, and is one of their top sellers.  There are also useful digital photo sites where you can compare products and features to determine which camera is right for you.
