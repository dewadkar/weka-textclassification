            My husband,then boyfriend,bought this car for me when I was in highschool.That was in 1994.At first I hated it because it was a 5 speed stick shift,but then realized after driving a friends automatic transmission Prizm,the stick shift out preformed the automatic.
I only have to fill up about once every two weeks as long as I don't go on any road trips. 
The only times it has been wrecked were when I hit deer,and still after being fixed it looks great.The paint has lasted and looks especially great when waxed.
We have recently had problems with the doors not shutting properly on the driver's side and passenger side up front.We were very disappointed that there was not a recall on this because we had to pay $40 per door to fix the latches.
It is a good car for a small family,although once you have 2 children in the backseat things do start to get a little cramped making it very difficult to go on long trips in this car.
I would recommend a used Prizm for a teenager or an elderly person.The gas mileage is great,it's a nice looking car,and it's not too expensive.
