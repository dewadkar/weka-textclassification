            Okay, so i know there aren't a whole lot of people who find geo a reliable car... but in 1997 I came into a deal i couldn't refuse and found myself the proud owner of a 92' geo prism. it was GREAT! i loved it... it was the perfect car for someone my age. But everyone was telling me how they crumbled in a crash and were not safe at all! i started to worry...

Not for long, however... a mere 4 days after i bought the car, on march 21, i hydroplaned and drove over an embankment... my almost new car fell 6 ft into someones front yard and i hit a tree, pulling it right out of the ground and wedged myself in a ditch. my car was totaled, i was devestated. But i unbuckled my seatbelt and got out... do you think that would have happened in the car i owned 4 days ago? (an 81' VW Rabbit convertible) Nope... me either.

But wait! there's more... one year later... april 7, 98 i was following a friend home, just 5 months after the return of my car, after 6 months in the hands of my talented dad for repair, i was in, yet another totaling accident in my beloved Geo Prism. A drunk driver who was running from the cops, came around a corner that was to sharp and cut into my lane, sideswiping the drivers side of my car. Once more, i unbuckled my seatbelt and got out.

This time, we decided not to fix the car, but it has come to a time, when i happen to be looking for a new car due to a coming baby, and i have brought it to my husband's attention, that i would like another Prism... i put my trust fully into Geo, with my life, and my new babys.
