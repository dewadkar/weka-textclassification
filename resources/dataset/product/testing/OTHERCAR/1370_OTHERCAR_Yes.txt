            When I first bought a 1993 Mitsubishi Eclipse, I was not expecting all that much from it.  The purchase was made mainly because of the price.  But now i love the car.  Though it is not as spectacular as the higher class sports cars like the Mitsu 3000GT or the Nissan 300ZX, it will please the buyer greatly.  I have not had any problems with the car since i bought it.  The car has great acceleration and great handling.  One of the biggest surprises, however, is the handling in the snow.  The car has never lost control in bad weather.  The newer Eclipses may look nicer on the exterior, but the engine on the older bodies is much stronger.  <br><br>
