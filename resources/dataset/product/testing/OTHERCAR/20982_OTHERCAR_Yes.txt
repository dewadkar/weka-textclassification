            For 6 long years I've obsessed over this car.  This small, two-seater roadster perfected by Mazda.  Those Zoom Zoom campaigns just about killed me.... Before I begin, let me just warn you that I'm very biased about my new car.  She's perfect.  I've driven a 97, 99, 2000 and 2001 Miata, and the following will tell you how I made this choice.

The 2001 Miata, a second generation Miata, was introduced in fall of last year, showing minor exterior upgrades and a new engine.  Also, we saw new higher seats, special gauges and the option for 6 speed in the LS.  It also originally held the promise of 152 hp, which was later changed due to CA Emissions testing.  (Mazda did compensate for this)  

Wanting to get my miata this year, I drove the years listed above to find that the 1997 and 1999 were too rigid, and the 2000 just wasn't right.  I took the 2001 for a test drive (after finding out I could get financed for it) and fell in love.  I wasn't hitting every little bump as I had in other MX-5's and the road noise wasn't all that bad with top up or down.  It felt faster and smoother.  Not being a professional, this was proof enough.  I purchased a base Miata with a conv. package within the month.

My Miata zooms around curves as no other car can, making Camaro's and other sports cars turn their heads.  The suspension on these things are amazing.  The torque is amazing.  I take off, shifting so smoooooothly and look back to see traffic way behind me.  What a feeling! Sure those Lexus and Mercedes convertables look nice, but they don't have nearly as much bang for the buck.  Words can not even begin describe this car's greatness.  GO drive one and see what I'm talking about!
