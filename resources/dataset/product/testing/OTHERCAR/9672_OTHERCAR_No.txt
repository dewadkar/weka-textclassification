            I bought a 1997 Dodge Neon new in June of 1997. I was very happy when I first had the car, but I was soon very disapointed. The car looses a lot of power when the air conditioning is running (more than most cars), the transmission shifts very roughly, the radio reception is absolutely horrible, and the engine is extremely loud. Secondly, I have heard from numerous other Neon owners how disappointed they are too. Many times the engine blows very early in the car's life and other mechanical problems plague the car after about 40,000 miles. In fact I have already had my automatic transmission replaced with only 25,000 on the car. I would NOT recommend a Neon to anyone. It is cheap to buy, but you get what you pay for.<br><br>
