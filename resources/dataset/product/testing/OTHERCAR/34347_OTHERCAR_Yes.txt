            	The Infiniti Q45 is a stable, comfy car that performs exceptionally on some roads and not so exceptionally on other roads. This car is pwered by a powerful 266 hp V-*8 engine, but since the car weighs in at 3900 pounds, it isn't going to be competing with the likes of the BMW 540i, Mercedes E430, or the Lexus GS 400. To be fair, the invoice of this car is $41,000, which is about as low as a V-8 US semi luxury. Of course, this car has Japanese engineering that is usually more reliable than American Engineering. 
	The Q45 has a smooth ride on the highway, but if you live in the back seats, it may be a little floaty on tight turns. The ride is very nearly silent, until you go above 60 mph. General performance of this car is what a person would expect from car of this caliber.
	Many people think this car's direct competition is the Lexus LS400. Except, this car is about $12,000 cheaper. Even though this car lacks some of the niceties that are on the Lexus, such as dual climate control, a large trunk, and a 290hp V-8, this car still holds up well. This car is a threat to Cadillacs and Lincolns. Look out GM, Ford!<br><br>
