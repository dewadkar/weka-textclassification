            My wife and I bought the new Impala in July, and so far we are very excited about it. Immediately after buying it in our home state of Pennsylvania, we moved to Florida, and so it has seen three 1500 mile trips already. We have just over 9500 miles on it now, and we both like it quite a bit. 

We initially went to look at the Malibu, but were both so disappointed in the small size of the Malibu that we immediately started looking at Impalas. We found that the Impala is a much bigger car for not very much more money, and the difference was worth the comfort for us. With the Malibu I could not even get the seat back far enough to drive comfortably (I'm 6'1&quot;), and when I had it back the whole way, I don't even think a child could have ridden comfortably behind me. In contrast, I don't even put the seat back the whole way to drive our Impala, and my friends can still ride comfortably in the back seat, even behind me. 

We went with the 3.8L engine, and have been getting between 23 and 26 miles per gallon on average. We also have the custom cloth interior with the Auburn Nightmist exterior, both of which are very easy to keep clean. The aluminum wheels are a bit more annoying to keep clean, but their appearance is worth the trouble. 

Overall, the Impala is a great car, and I would recommend it to anyone. The only thing we really miss is a CD player, which we are looking at getting installed at the dealer.
