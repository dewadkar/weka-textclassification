            Last summer, we purchased a used 98 Venture. It is the extended version with 8 seats, rear air, rear stereo controls, cd player, full power and all other options, excluding the power doors. It's a lovely fire engine red and has aluminum wheels.

We bought this due to some family that was coming into town for a month. This made the number of people in the house 8, and our 4 door S10 Blazer wouldn't have cut it. After checking into rental vans and finding that they were running $1600+ for one month during that time frame, we decided just to buy a van instead and put that $1600 towards the purchase price. And so, we bought the first one we saw, which happened to be a great deal..but I digress. :)

With the easy fold up seats, this van is a delight. I have been out numerous times and have needed extra space. It's a breeze to fold up each seat and remove it and within several seconds, there's plenty of room. We have enough room with all the seats out (those behind the front seats) to carry a full size freezer. The seats are comfortable and provide enough room for 3 adults to sit comfortably across the aisle. The second row has enough leg room for just about anyone..my 6'2&quot; husband rides back there frequently and had no trouble with lack of leg room. The third row has the option of sliding forward for more cargo in the rear, or back, for more leg room. With it fully forward, the leg room is a bit cramped for an adult, but perfect for a child.

There is plenty of head room throughout the van and even the tallest rider won't scrape the ceiling. With it's dual doors, getting in and out is easier than a standard, full size van, and helps make this van into a large &quot;car.&quot; 

The Venture is built on a car frame so you get the smooth handling, cornering, and driveability of a car with all the functionality of a van.

With the rear air, the folks in back are able to stay cool or warm without the need for blasting the fan in the front. With our summers temps here, over 100 with high humidity, it's important to us that our vehicle interiors cool down fast, lest we faint away from the heat. The rear air makes cooling down the entire van quick and efficient; and once cool, it stays cool from there on out, regardless of outdoor temp or humidity.

Our model came equipped with traction control. With this, when the wheels start to slide, the computer pulses one brake and then another, stopping the slide immediately. We have a lot of ice and some snow here during the winter months and this made driving in this weather safer. Apart from getting stuck in our driveway (there was a 4 foot snowbank and like a fool, I tried to plow through it..lolol) we didn't have any trouble getting around.

Our model was also equipped with a cockpit control panel. This includes miles gone, outdoor temp, average fuel economy, compass, miles left on remaining fuel and average speed. I don't need to go into how helpful this can be!

This van gets 22-30 mpg on the highway and 21-22 in the city. The V6 has a quick pick up and offers a perfect amount of power. For everything that the Venture offers, it is a very well-rounded vehicle perfectly suited for families of all sizes...we're a family of 3 and couldn't live without it!

I would not hesitate to recommend this van to anyone. I think you would be more than happy with the functionality of the Venture. I know we have been.<br><br>
