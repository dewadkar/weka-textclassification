            If you find yourself in a financial pinch and need a car.....just remember you get what you pay for. It came about that we needed a second car and we really did not want a used one. We looked all over trying to find something around $10,000.00. the choice was slim for a new car. Kia stood out because it had more interior room then the others we looked at. We took a test drive and was surprised at how peppy it seemed. The exterior was nice looking as well. We bought our little car and thought we made a wise choice. It didn't take but a month for little surprises to pop up. The brakes started to make funny noises, we took to the dealer,and to our amazement we found out the brakes had a defect..okay we'll let this one slide mistakes do happen. (it didn't cost to have it fixed either) About two weeks later my son rolled down his window in the back and the molding came off. This was another trip to the dealer to fix another Boo-Boo(all day with out my car too). It became apparent that I would be a regular at the dealership. Then to top it all off we had two recalls on it too(one for emissions, and one for windshield wipers). Now that it has been over the one year mark, getting past all the breaking in glitches(that's what they said in the repair shop). I still tell everyone to stay away from the Kia unless they like repair shops to hang out at!<br><br>
