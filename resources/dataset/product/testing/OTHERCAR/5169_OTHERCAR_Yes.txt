            Model Info: 1999 
Price Paid: 19000 

Strengths: Outstanding handling, reliability, gas mileage and quality.  
Weaknesses: The seats in the standard cab can not be purchased with a power option. The fixed position is too low and the cushions are too hard for someone without any padding on their butt. 

Color selection is very limited, both inside and out. 
Compared To: Full size Dodge truck, several cars of all makes and models I've recently driven. 
Review Summary: I bought a loaded SLT standard cab, short bed, 318 with automatic and optional handling package. This truck handles nearly as well as our Chrysler 300M, and gets decent mileage while doing it. In two years it has averaged over 18 mpg and has made over 21 on trips. 

With the stock 318, it runs 15.5 in the quarter mile which means it keeps up with most stock Mustangs and Camaros, and I could probably beat most of them in a handling course! 

In 32,000 miles, the truck has never been back to the dealer for anything. 

I can't say enough good things about this truck. It's the only new vehicle I ever bought that has been perfect from the time I drove it off the dealer's lot. Based on previous experience with this dealer's service department, I'm glad I've not had any problems. I'm almost scared to take it in for the required transmission service and brake line recall inspection!
