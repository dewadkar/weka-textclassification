            EEEYup. There's no denying I'm one of the more mechanically enfeebled earthlings. Now I do know where to put the oil -- but that's about the extent of it.

So when I went to buy a used car in 1998, it was to a dealer who came very highly recommended for honesty and fairness. Arriving at the lot, I walked right over to a maroon mid-sized car that seemed to be calling my name. I sat down in that car, a 1991 Dodge Dynasty, and I knew it was mine.  Plush maroon seats, tilt steering wheel, air conditioning...all the things people like me find most important. I also liked the lack of electric windows, having heard too many horror stories about them. Of course, being in a state of car innocence (or ignorance, as is actually the case), I asked a million questions and was given generous dollops of rich and well-founded advice by the patient dealer. I happily drove my 'new' car to the authorized mechanics, who checked everything thoroughly and told me all kinds of fascinating things about car care.

I've never been sorry. Maggie, my Dynasty, cares not a whit about my lack of knowledge, being satisfied that I will be faithful about oil changes and other important checks mechanical. I, on the other hand, am extremely grateful to be able to drive in comfort on roads that seem remarkably un-bumpy. I take day-long trips with no hesitation, drive through storms carefully but without anxiety, and spend very little on gasoline and maintenance.

How much more could JL the Unmechanical ask?!<br><br>
