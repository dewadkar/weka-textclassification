            Honda has always been known to make a great product and the civic has been a no exception.  In the last few years Honda has refined the civic's body style and made the two door version more sleek and sporty.  The new model year offers a sport edition with more horsepower for those who want a quick little car.  There is also a gas efficient version that is great for the commuter or anyone that doesn't want to be hanging out at a gas station all the time filling up their tank.  I have owned an EX model and thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was roomy enough for four to five people.  I loved time that I owned my Honda because not only was it reliable but it was a great car to get around town in.  I probably would of had the car for longer but an accident put it out of commission for good.  For the record If you are reaching for a snickers in the other seat you should still pay attention to the road!!!<br><br>
