            The Toyota Camry has been a favorite of mine for quite sometime.  Even as far as ten years back, I would always look at the Toyota Camry as begin one of the longest lasting, and most reasonable cars out on the market.  The 2000 Camry has been changed slightly from the 1999 year in that the lights on the front and rear have been slightly altered to give it a sleeker look.  Since we are on the topic of looks, why don't we mull over the 2000 Camry's design.  First off, the Lexus ES300 is built on the same platform as the Camry, and you can see some resemblance.  The Camry is a mid-size vehicle that looks aggressive and a bit luxurious.  The car is nicely styled to give it an aerodynamic appeal, and the color blended side moldings add &quot;class&quot; to the Camry.  The optional sunroof gives the car a finishing touch that screams comfort and luxury.  The 4 cylinder engine is the more popular of the two available engines in the Camry, the other being the V-6.  The 4 cylinder engine is more popular for those looking for a better bargain, better gas mileage, and that dead quiet ride.  The V-6 has much more power, and the 60mph to 80mph acceleration can not be compared with the 4 cylinder.  This is not to say that the 4 cylinder is absolutely without power.  The 4 cylinder does its job on most any given conditions.  The gas mileage is great, and there is no hill that can not be conquered by the 4 cylinder.  Both the V-6 and the 4 cyl. have a dead quiet idle, and even full throttle is not too heavy.  This car also has great handling, despite its rather large size and high stance.  The steering is very light and does not take much effort to manuever the car.  Sports car enthusiasts like a tighter and harder steering that lets you feel the road, but the Camry is obviously geared towards those looking for comfort and every day practical usage.  This car lives up to Toyota's slogan, &quot;for everyday people.&quot;  There are a few versions avaiable, and basically the difference is the standard options that come with each model.  I would recommend the LE (4 cyl).  It comes with standard power options (doors, locks, windows, brakes, steering).  It also has a standard automatic transmission with over drive, and a nice stereo with cassette.  All this and a car that has a reputation of lasting a very long time for right around $18,000.  However, there are high end models available, like the V-6 XLE, which has the optional V-6 engine and all the options.  (Leather Seating, Power seats, sunroof, upgraded stereo sound with CD, etc, etc)  The V-6 XLE goes out for about $24,500.  I personally would not go with the upper end Camry, because it loses value and bang for the buck as you keep upgrading.  I feel the best bang for your buck is the LE (4 cyl).  You get the most for your dollar.  The Camry is equipped with dual airbags and an advanced side impact system that makes camry one of the safest cars in its class.  The Camry makes a great family car because of the large trunk space, and the roomy rear seats.  The car is extremely comfortable to drive and sit in!  If you are looking for a great car for under $20,000 go test drive the 2000 Camry today!   <br><br>
