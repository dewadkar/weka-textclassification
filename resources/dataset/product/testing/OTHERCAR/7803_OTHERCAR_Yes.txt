            If you want a sporty car for a great price then Saturn is for you.  I bought my 1994 SC1 last January at 98,800 miles, after driving it for 3 months, I still like it! The SC1 is a great car for the money although it does have its ups and downs, but no car is PERFECT...

Performance: Well let's face it. Saturn was foolish to put such a slow engine on such a sporty model, as this car has a feeble 85 HP engine, while the SL's have a twin-cam 124 HP model.  But that's O.K. It's not the slowest car in the world, with a 0-60 in 11.5 seconds (compare that to the 1964 VW Beetle, with a whopping 29.5 seconds) and the 5 speed tranny gives it somewhat of a sporty pep. The brakes are O.K. but with ABS it's not bad at all. it has average stopping power. I really haven't been able to determine handling quality, but it hasn't rolled over or started skidding on turns, so i suppose it's good. With a little "aftermarket magic" this car has good performance potential. Fuel economy is good, mine is about 26 mpg city, which is good considering the car is 9 years old.

Interior:  The interior is sporty and well designed, but its kind of hard to get out of because its relatively low to the ground and kinda "slanted", but the seats are comfortable.  The back seat is almost impossible to get into, let alone sit in. but since I don't even use the back seat, it doesn't bother me. Tilt wheel makes it easier to get comfortable.

Exterior: the exterior is probably this car's best quality. you can bombard the car with shopping carts and they just bounce right back with not a dent in the body.  I love the "sporty lines and curves" of the Saturn which makes it really attractive.  The shiny metallic red paint tops it off nicely. and you will never see a rusty saturn becuase of the plastic body panels. 

Features:  the air conditioning is cool, but i haven't really tested it out because winter is just ending here (April). ABS is very helpful when driving through snow (which we've had alot of this winter), and cruise control is cool for those long trips (which i never go on), but nonetheless it's cool to have. Power windows are still going strong... 

Reliability/Quality: well in the three months I had it I had to change the alternator and the battery, but that's about it, nothing major. it doesn't have a history of major repairs either. I think the battery was about due for change anyway (it was like 2ï¿½ every morning).  It wouldn't pass emissions but after a tune up (which it needed anyway) it passed fine. the "service engine soon" light goes on but I'm going to have that checked out and repaired this week.  the underbody looks like new, after 100,000 miles (no rust), the exhaust and muffler are solid.  The clutch is as solid as a rock and I expect it to keep on going for another 10K+ miles... overall this car is pretty reliable.
