            I first entered the digital photography arena a year ago with an Olympus D-340R 1.3 megapixel camera. Although I enjoyed the convenience of digital, it wasn't long before I began longing for higher resolution, so that I could make and frame enlargements of my better shots. My half-serious investigations into 2MP cameras led me to the Coolpix 800. Several days after reading about it on a whim, I found myself placing an order for this excellent camera; I've been sold on it ever since.

There were three main qualities I was looking for in a camera: (1) Resolution - I wanted to be able to make at least 8x10 enlargements at photo quality; (2) Features - as an amateur photographer used to working with a basic 35mm SLR, a range of manual controls was desirable; (3) Price - I couldn't afford to spend more than $400 on a new camera. With its 2MP resolution, many of the same features as the Coolpix 950, and a price under $350 (after a mail-in rebate), the Coolpix 800 met all of my qualifications, and then some.

This camera is exceptionally easy to use. Automatic mode is all many people will ever need to capture perfect photos again and again. Navigating the menus to set the manual features was surprisingly easy, as well (although some familiarity with photography is helpful here... understanding what IPO, white-balance, spot metering, etc. are will make a real difference).

The images captured by the 800 have been uniformly top-notch. Sunset-lit clouds are exposed beautifully, macro photos are sharp and detailed, and JPEG compression is barely noticeable, even at the &quot;basic&quot; (=lowest) quality setting. The 2x zoom is helpful in framing, although it is not quite long enough to use as a telephoto. Getting reasonably close to your subject is still a must. Digital zoom, as ever, is not worth much on this - or any other - camera.

The 800 fits nicely in the hand, with a large grip that houses the batteries, balancing the camera quite well. As others have noted, the compact flash slot is covered by a somewhat flimsy door, but it seems tough enough to last. The camera as a whole is quite sturdy, passing my (inadvertent!) 12-inch-drop test. Although it made a heart-stopping THUD! upon landing, everything continued to work perfectly... once I was able to breathe again.

NiMH batteries, additional memory, and a USB card reader will definitely make your experience with this camera a better one. And the Coolpix 800, like any product, has quirks that can prove annoying. Still, this camera was a good value at its original price point of $600. At $335, it's a steal. Point-and-shooter, novice, amateur, artist, or even a pro who wants an extremely portable camera that's not a letdown... whatever you are, you'll enjoy the photos you take with this camera - and the process of taking them. Very highly recommended.<br><br>
