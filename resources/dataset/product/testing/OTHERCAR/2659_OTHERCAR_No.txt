            It�s easy to see  why this original sport utility vehicle is still so popular, just look at it.  Classic and timeless styling, even Land Rover ripped-off the design for its old Defender.  Granted the Jeep Wrangler is not a luxury car, and it�s not really that much fun to drive. On good roads and around town the Wrangler's ancient roots are obvious.

To what does one compare the Jeep Wrangler?  It�s hard to say, on the one hand it is a small, truck based SUV selling for about $20,000 � plenty of comparisons there.  On the other hand, it is capable of off-road duties only a fool would attempt in a Honda CRV or Kia Sportage.

My experience tells me that MOST people will use the Wrangler as transportation on normal roads, so my comments will focus mainly on the Wranglers performance in everyday driving situations.  I don�t seriously think all those college girls are conquering the Rubicon between semesters.  Perhaps a real 4 wheel enthusiast will review the Wrangler in its intended element.

Inside the Wrangler, seats are surprisingly uncomfortable given how long one might potentially be behind the wheel.  Rear seats are equally surprising in their roominess and comfort.  Especially cool is the front seat mechanism that lifts the seat up and forward to make access to the back seat easy. A similar function is found on the VW GTI and both beg the question, �why doesn�t every 2 door car have this?�  I have no answer.  Base Wranglers come with vinyl seats, but cloth is optional on the SE and Sport models.  Upgraded stereo and hard top are almost mandatory for travel of any distance �on road.�

Gauges and switchgear seem a bit dated, but that is most likely because they are old.   Modern cars have spoiled most of us with their near perfect ergonomic design, the Wrangler�s interior was designed in much simpler time, when the word ergonomic probably got you beaten up at school for using �one of them fancy words.� Switches feel durable.  The radio control buttons are too small, and require the driver to take his/her eyes off the road to adjust. A rugged theme is carried throughout the interior with durable looking materials and square angles.

Removal of the soft top is a two person job, and an engineering degree wouldn�t hurt your chances of doing it quickly.  Practice makes perfect, a few times at bat will make you a pro. Removal of the hard top is much simpler, but still requires two people due to its size.

On the road the Wrangler is noisy. Road noise, wind noise, engine noise, tire noise � you name it, the Wrangler has it. And this is with the hard top firmly in place !  The ride is not as choppy as in some other small SUVs. For example, if given the choice between a Suzuki Vitara or a Jeep Wrangler for a long trip... I�d pick the Jeep.  Yes it feels like a truck, but the ride has a little civility to it on the highway.  However, cornering at speeds above 15 mph result in lean, and plenty of body roll.  I am sure this suspension is quite useful when negotiating switchbacks in the middle of nowhere, but around town it is somewhat un-nerving.  

The 4.0 L inline 6 makes 180 hp and is adequate for normal freeway merging, but don�t expect to win any drag races. Acceleration from a dead stop results in some lifting and twisting of the body.  The engine has a good deal of torque, but it is not managed very well. The inline 6 is fairly refined, and the noise is due, mostly, to lack of sound deadening material under the hood.  The automatic shifts up and down with a muted jolt, and unexpected downshifts are common when stepping on the gas even moderately.  Despite the engine, the power train, as a whole, is not very refined.  The whole Wrangler driving experience reminds me of driving a 1965 Mustang with a six under the hood. I can�t  explain why.

A big plus for the Wrangler is its size.  Parking is a breeze. Parallel parking has never been easier. And the height will help find empty spaces in the campus parking lot. Also, if you tow anything, navigating the Wrangler into position should have even unseasoned drivers hooked-up and on the road quickly.  Sport and Sahara models are available with an optional 3.73 Dana rear axle.

Consider what is available in the small to mid-size SUV segment. Nissan Xterra, Hyundai Santa Fe, Honda CRV, Toyota RAV 4, Ford Escape � there are a lot of choices. What the Jeep lacks in refinement, it makes up for in sheer utility.  Removable doors, fold-down windshield, removable top, replacement half doors and an interior that can be hosed out if it gets too dirty � now that�s utility !  And Honda thinks their little picnic table is so brilliant. The Wrangler is ALL utility.

Let�s face it, the Wrangler would be difficult to live with every day.  But it sure does go off-road like no other small SUV.  Not to mention how cool it looks, especially in Solar Yellow... with the driving lights... and the aluminum 5 spoke wheels.  Maybe I could live with it....
