            I bought my 1999 Pontiac Montana (pre-owned) as a replacement for my aging (1991) family car and to cart along my growing family (two kids &#150 so far &#150 under age 2.5).<br>The vehicle was GM Certified Used, so it came with a 3 month/3,000 bumper to bumper warranty. That certainly impacted my decision to purchase the car, as it provides me with some peace of mind that expensive repairs will not cost me too much for a reasonable period of time.<br><br>What do I like about the Montana?<br><br>It&#146s a spacious vehicle with seven passenger seating, including two bucket seats in the middle row.<br><br>The extras are nice, such as two sliding doors (passenger side is automatic), flexible seating arrangements, extended body for extra storage, &#147smart&#148 electronics (e.g., headlights that activate automatically when it gets dark or I&#146m in a tunnel, doors that lock when I engage the gearshift) and a stylish design.<br><br>This vehicle has a powerful engine that allows me to move into highway traffic easily and to pass the lollygaggers!<br><br>All of the safety features are greatly appreciated, especially for the reduced insurance rate I get for having them in my vehicle.<br><br>There&#146s not much I don&#146t like about the vehicle, but there are a few issues I want to have checked out before the warranty runs out, such as a minor rattle that I hear during ignition of the engine and a slight bump as the engine shifts from first to second and second to third gears.<br><br>Only two other minor issues have me bothered. First is the difficulty I had finding the tie-down hook for a child&#146s car seat&#146s tether. The manual says it&#146s on the floor near the second row of seat&#146s seat belt anchor. Have yet to find this hook.<br><br>Second is the sensitivity of the automatic sliding door. When I engage either the remote or the console button to close the door, it sometimes opens right back up and I have to hit the button again. Might just be a loose wire. I will have that checked.<br><br>I consider this a good vehicle to own so far.<br>
