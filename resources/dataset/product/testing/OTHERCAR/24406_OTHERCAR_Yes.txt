            Ten cents a mile?

I have been buying cars for over 35 years and have developed some handy guidelines for myself that you might also find useful.

The first is price per mile.  I have found that if you get one mile for every ten cents in initial cost you are doing very well.  This must be well above average when all kinds of car buyers are included.  

The second is crash worthiness.  If you get a mile for every dime but you do it at relatively greater risk, the economy is less meaningful.  I have flown military aircraft all my life and have been steeped in the idea of crash survival and injury avoidance.

The third is fuel economy.  My set standard is 30 mpg or better.

Fourth are the niceties.  If your car meets the above three things well, then any added niceties are a bonus.

1.  The Buick Lesabre Limited I recently bought met all of these criteria much better than I expected any used car would.  I think the easily expected life of most current vehicles is about 180,000 miles.  For $7,000 dollars a used car might have as much as 110,000 miles and still meet the criteria.  Mine had 80,000.

2.  It is big, has a driverï¿½s airbag, good restraints, and ABS.  It handles very well and has plenty of power.  All this contributes to a good level of crash worthiness or crash avoidance. 

3. It gets slightly better than 30 mpg overall with my kind of driving which is only slightly highway-heavy.

4.  The niceties on this car are plenteous.  It has a great sound system, climate control, all power seats, windows and mirrors, leather seats, cruise control and what have you.

A used Mercedes S-model diesel I once owned delivered 2 cents a mile before it gave up its life.  My Buick may duplicate that star performance if it continues as it has and as it seems to be going.

I also have to say that the 3800 engine seems to be a real gem.  I use synthetic oil (I do not know what was used previously) and the engine, at over 100,000 miles, is very tight.  It starts on one turn and is very responsive under way.  The oil stays remarkably clean between changes.  GM has done some bad things in the past but this engine seems to be good.

Try my formula.  Take 180,000 miles as a reasonable expectation.  If you bought a new car, did you pay more or less than $18,000?  Did you get a lot of expected miles for your money?  What else did you get?

Consider a used Buick Lesabre.
