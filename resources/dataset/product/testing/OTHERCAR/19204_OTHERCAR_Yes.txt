            Just a little background to give you some context: I bought the Sony MVC-CD400 about a month ago, and have shot about 400 pictures with it. I don't know very much about photography, have never owned a digital still camera of my own, and have never owned a film camera that costs more than $100.

With that said, I have been very impressed with the camera so far. Here are some things, both good and bad that have stood out to me:

1) I was concerned that there wasn't a viewfinder. On my Sony digital video camera the LCD isn't nearly bright enough to use outdoors on clear days, and I was worried that the LCD on this camera wouldn't fare any better. However, I was very surprised to find that the LCD was completely useable even on a bright day.

2) I was also concerned about bumping the camera while the disc was being written to and corrupting the disc. So far this hasn't been a problem, however I have been extremely careful, given the camera is so new still.

3) Slow access. This is a minor complaint, but since the camera uses a disc instead of high speed memory, accessing pictures in review mode on the LCD is somewhat slow. It takes about a second to load each low-res (read: fuzzy) thumbnail, and sometimes 5 seconds or longer to load the actual hi-res image.

4) Media. Using discs as media has several very strong advantages. Firstly, they are cheap; a 25 cent disc will hold @ 70 images at best quality/highest resolution. Secondly, storing the images on CD gives you a permanent (well at least as long as the life of the CDs) record of your photos (if you crash your hard drive in your computer, you can always go back to CD to recover your photos). Lastly, when you are away on vacation, there is absolutely no need to take a laptop with you to constantly dump photos onto to clear up your memory module.

5) As previously stated, I really don't know much about photography and I've only used this camera in fully automatic exposure mode. Even so, the pictures have been absolutely GREAT! I'm very happy and surprised with the image quality. As an aside, I am using Apple's iPhoto service which produces prints that I absolutely can not distinguish between film. (I have only printed on 4x6, however the resolution of the camera should allow for good quality 8x10 prints).

6) The camera is big as digital cameras go; roughly as big as a regular SLR camera. While this hasn't bothered me yet, I haven't had it on any long excursions either.

7) Battery time is probably less than cameras with solid state memory modules, because of the extra power the disc recorder requires. The camera, when fully charged, claims a run time of about 120-130 minutes while on (BTW, the camera will automatically turn itself off if not used for 3 minutes). I used it all day at Disneyland and took 70 pictures and had about 40 minutes left according to the battery meter on the camera.

The camera also has tons of other features that I will probably never get around to using as I just want to shoot simple still pictures (i.e. it can record MPEG movie clips; record sound annotation; manual exposure settings, etc.).
