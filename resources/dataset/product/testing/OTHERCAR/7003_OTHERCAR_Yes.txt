              For about $650 you can own a HP c500 digital camera. This is what most would consider a great quality camera at a mid range price. You can take this camera anywhere, it is small and weighs less than 1lb. 
  I've used this camera on vacations and trips and I haven't lost a moment I wanted to capture! It features3x optical and 2x digital zoom with 6x total,  very cool Jetsend wireless technology allows you to print without wires. You can also download photos instantly to your PC.
  It comes with a 16mb flashcard, all needed cables, rechargeable batteries and charger, but best of all is the HP Photo imaging software!
This software allows you to edit your own photos create albums, layouts, etc... I recently used this software and camera to create and print an amazing photo album for my parents 30th wedding anniversary!
  The pictures are perfect as can be, although I'd like it better if it had an auto zoom feature. The c500 is also a tough little guy. Mine fell out of my pocket and down the stairs. Besides a small scratch, everything was still in tact!
  The features are all unbelievably easy to learn and use. The software is fool proof as well!
   Great camera, great price!<br><br>
