            I own a 1992 Chevy Z71 Pickup.  It's been the best truck I've owned.  I've had it 7 years now, It just turned 80,000 miles and I still have people ask me &quot; Is that a 1996 model &quot;  I keep good care of it at it takes care of me.  In the last seven years the only think I've had to fix is the Fuel pump.  I'm on my third set of tires and it's still running like the day I drove it off the lot.  Chevy makes great trucks and they are a dependable vehical.  When I go to buy another one, it will be a Chevy.<br><br>
