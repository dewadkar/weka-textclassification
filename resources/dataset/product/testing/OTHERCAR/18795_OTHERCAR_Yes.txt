            Okay, so you don't have a lot of cash to spend but want something that's dependable and rugged while still being stylish and that will allow you to go places you've never seen on a map; here it is.  I bought "Bailey" last summer after unwillingly being forced to part with "Madison" a 1994 GMC Jimmy SLT.  Anyone who has owned a Jimmy of this era knows their propensity for transmission failure between 120,000 and 130,000 miles.  Well my gorgeous girl was moaning and groaning so I asked my car salesman husband to find me a suitable replacement.  He called me two hours later and said his dealership had just bought four SUVs and I had better come pick one of them before they went on the lot.

So I drove into town and was met with lovely examples of Rodeos, Passports and Blazers and then finally this little red Jeep.  I weighed all my options carefully; mileage, cost overall, engine, etc. and when I approached what became my latest acquisition I frowned.  She is a beautiful bright red but has this questionably hideous tan interior. (What were they thinking?  Oops, I forgot, Chrysler builders!) Although accented nicely by black on the dash and doors, she just reminded me of a Toyota Tercel I had once owned while still in High School. 

She was loaded with options as her Classic trim denotes but still had no privacy glass and a rinky-dink cassette player.  My SLT had full privacy glass, an excellent (Bose) factory CD player and leather!  Could I digress???  Well once I drove her my mind was made up.  She's very peppy, she loves to corner and she ate up the course where my husband's dealership takes potential 4-wheel drive buyers to road test.  Additionally, she had my daughter's Durango for lunch both off-road and at the gas pump!!

Suffice it to say the money I saved by buying Bailey allowed me to install a very nice Phoenix Gold CD system (thank God this truck didn't come with Infinity) and completely black out her windows to the likes of my GMC.  I bought a throw to put on the backseat and real Sheepskin covers for the front buckets.

I'm a real estate agent and sometimes doing my job means going where only real men (and women) rarely go.  I have seen places that other agents could only wonder about, in 4-HI sometimes in 2 wheel drive (Does this Jeep have 4-LO?? I don't know, I've never needed it!) Bailey and I cruise about town quite a lot and she never fails to turn a head when people see her coming.  I love her to death and could never consider parting with her.  The only fights this truck and I have are over gas mileage and when I try to fit someone taller than 4'5" into her back seat.  Other than that; she's all Jeep beneath a very pretty facade and yeah, the tan grows on you after awhile.

Update:  Yes, folks I still love her!  A few things I neglected to address when originally writing the review.  Instrumentation; terrific but the tilt wheel hides some of the gauges in any position, could be a problem if your foot gets heavy later on in the day but cruise control is handy for fatigue.  The thing I like most about this truck (sorry "Jeep") is everything is within close distance control wise so once you know where all of the switches are, you never have to look away from the road.  Unlike my Mitsubishi, Chrysler opted to keep the controls simple and frill-less.  I actually like this in a four-wheel drive because sometimes you have better things to do than worry about "did I push the right button?". Her control buttons for the windows and locks on the doors are illuminated too for an easy find in the dark. Additionally, Bailey has very friendly and quaint knobs.  Her AC is wonderful, will freeze you to death if you turn it all the way into the blue zone and in the winter folks, do not turn the heater on full blast, it will fuse your pantyhose to your legs!  

Previously I had remarked that I had never had occasion to use 4-Lo.  Well, off-road fans, the day finally arrived!  She did get stuck but it was not her fault.  It was her brilliant "mother's" arrogance that led to her first embarrassing moment but with a little coaxing she overcame the situation with ease.  All season radial tires were not meant to meet with sopping wet clay surfaces.  I should have listened to my client when he said 'let's walk in'. But me being me said 'Are you kidding, this is a Jeep, we're drivin'"  Let's just say I won't do that again.  

My husband has always been a little incensed by the fact that I actually move into whatever I drive.  Bailey is very accomodating.  Her cargo area is spacious and holds all of my signs, my tool box and an oversized tote which contains all weather gear, a change of clothes, boots, blankets, extra oil, a jug of water and the like.  All the while still possessing enough room for a full-size spare under a semi-cheesy carpeted (yes, tan) tire cover.  I especially like the way you access the cargo area.  The entire back gate lifts up.  You don't have to unhook the spare tire, lift the glass and then lower the tailgate. (But beware, if you are tall, it's easy to hit your head on the corners).  My only real b**ch is the location of her jack.  You have to fold up the rear seat to get to it.  They should have put it under the hood.  

I never really discussed her engine much but it is a very torquey inline 4.0 six cylinder.  It's very strong and very responsive and not economical (about 15MPG) strictly in town but as previously disclosed strictly highway, cruise control driving will net around 24MPG.  Thinking logically, that's not bad for a 6000 lb. SUV.
