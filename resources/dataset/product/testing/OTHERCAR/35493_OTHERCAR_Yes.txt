            The Honda Odyssey is a vehicle that has combined the space and versatility of a people mover with the comfort, safety and drive- ability of a luxury car. The Odyssey will seat 6 adults comfortably due to it's innovative interior that is both spacious and easily accessible. Unlike most of people movers, the Odyssey is at home in city traffic as well as cruising the open roads. The 2.2 litre engine is not only very efficient but is also remarkably quiet. If your looking for a people mover but don't want a bulky 4WD then I would recommend the Honda Odyssey. The Honda Odyssey won the 1995 Wheels Car of the Year award. The judges singled out Odyssey's advanced engineering, roominess, responsive handling and refinement.
