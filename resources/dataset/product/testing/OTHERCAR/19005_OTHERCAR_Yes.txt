            The first time I saw the Tiburon I was in love....and that was the 1999 model.  Good thing I waited, because in retrospect, I hate those old headlights.  

Oh my God, when I saw the 2003 Tiburon, I thought I was going to die.  This was a car I had wanted for years, any my dad bought it for me as a college graduation present back in April of 2002.  <b>EVERYONE</b> stared when I drove by.  No one knew what this gorgeous car was.  I had people stopping me in parking lots asking me about my car.

This car looks amazing inside and out,  it has lines and curves that were obviously copied by Nissan and Honda later on.  It's so original!  How many cars do you see on the road and go "eh"?  Honestly, the looks of this car are in the league of a classic Mustang or Corvette.

The interior is elegant.  I have black on black leather.  Truly a gorgeous presentation of this vehicle.  Smooth lines again, silver accents on the shifter (I have an automatic with the fun auto-shift) & steering wheel.  You feel beautiful and rich and elegant, sitting low, looking out the window.  You know people are looking at you, wondering what this car is.

This car comes with everything standard.  You have all the trimmings, everything is electric, a/c, & a nice Infinity stereo system with a woofer in the trunk.

As I've said, I've had this car since April 2002, and I've only had 2 problems.  The sunroof broke, and the drivers-side window wouldn't roll down, but they fixed those problems in a day.  Anyone who has power windows or sunroofs know that this is a common problem, since the gears tend to be made of nylon instead of metal, so the teeth strip and the motor can't function.  They had the parts on hand (they were probably aware of the problem and were prepared to fix it) and of course it was free, since it was all warranty.

Quite honestly, I love my car, and writing this, I'm starting to feel REALLY bad that I haven't washed it....it looks so sad.

Some won't like the tiny back seat, but it's a coupe(!!), just don't have any friends!  I've got shoes & jackets back there, I feel too bad putting people back there....you have to remember Korea is a nation of midgets compared to us freakish noodle-limbed Americans.

The <b>ONLY</b> peeve I have with this vehicle is the sub-par paint job, and the fact that some bozo dinged the hell out of my car!!  I could kill whoever did that.  The paint does seem to scratch more easily than my mom's Ford Taurus, and the service guy attributed that to different quality standards in S. Korea than America.  Oh well, soon enough I'll be able to fix those horrid little dings in my baby and she'll be drop dead gorgeous again......
