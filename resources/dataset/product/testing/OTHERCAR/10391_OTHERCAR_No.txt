            I purchased the Kia Sephia for multiple reasons,... two of the most important was the price as well as the size/ styling of the car. I really loved the car during the test drive and had absolutely no complaints after signing the paperwork and driving it off the lot. Within 1 month of my purchase, I had been in Kia's service department at least 3 times! Within 3 months my visits to Kia's service department had reached an overwhelming 9 times! All for brake problems and AC problems. I finally realized that &quot;LEMON LAW&quot; was an only option. 

The car's styling HAS greatly improved and I love the fact that a short person like myself (4'11) could sit comfortably and still be able to see over the steering wheel. However for the money spent, I really feel like it should have offered A LOT more than I got. 

Kia realizes that the airbags obstruct the ventilation on the passenger side of the car, however they have not taken any strides to rectify this matter, nor have they worked towards better braking systems. Until this happens I feel for the owners who have gone through the countless days in the service department, or for those that are still crossing their fingers and hoping that their brakes will work for them! In my opinion, the KIA Sephia sounds like a great deal for the money, but it's simply not a sound automobile for safety!<br><br>
