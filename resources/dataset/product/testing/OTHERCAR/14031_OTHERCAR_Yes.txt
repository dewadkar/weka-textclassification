            I purchased a 98 Sunfire last year which was supposed to be a promo.  The car is really sharp looking.  Had been looking for a convertible for some time and when I saw it, I &quot;had to have it&quot;.  It has a fantastic stereo system and is very comfortable to drive and handled very well during the winter months in the snow and ice.  My biggest gripe is the rattles and shakes!  I'm beginning to wonder if the car I bought was in an accident or if there is something wrong with it.  I've always been a careful driver missing pot holes and slowing to a walk when necessary over construction sites, bad roads and railroad tracks.  Had 2 87's that were tight as new.  If there is anyone out there that has a Sunfire Convertible I'd like to hear their opinion on the stability of the car.  Maybe I didn't drive it hard enough when I tried it out but it didn't seem to rattle like it does now.  I'm well aware of the fact that convertibles don't have the framework to hold them together as other types of vehicles but I've had other convertibles and never noticed this kind of problem with them.  

Other than the rattles and shaking, it's a great car.  I love it...gets very good mileage, is fun to drive, snappy and handles very well.  Could use a better turning radius.  

I have a parent who is wheelchair bound and part of my requirement purchasing the vehicle was ease in getting the chair in and out of the trunk and my mother in and out of the car.  Surprisingly she transfers very well and the chair fits fairly easily in the trunk.  I had a terrible time getting her chair in the Chrysler Sebring I tried out even though the Chrysler's trunk is only a could of cubic feet smaller.  The cargo net in the trunk is a pain with the chair but great when shopping.

Thanks - hope to hear from other owners soon.
