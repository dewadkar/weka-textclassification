            I wasn't crazy about buying this car.  We came into a (very) little extra money and my husband was intent on buying a car.  I wanted to pay down bills or invest the money... but my husband wore me down and soon we were signing on the dotted line.

We got the VR6 4-door version.  We had every option: sunroof, winter package including heated side view mirrors, heated windshield fluid dispensers, and heated seats, power everything, leather seats, and so many more features I can't even remember them.

My husband also insisted on buying the manual transmission version of this car.  He said with the VR6, we had to have manual to really enjoy the power of the car.  There was just one small problem.  Neither my husband nor I could drive a manual.  So, on the big day when we went to pick out beautiful new car, my dad had to drive it off the lot and take us to a big shopping mall so we could learn how to drive our new car.

The clutch must have been made from some indestructible material.  Both of us learned how to drive (we even learned how to make some really great bad smells along the way) and we put nearly 150K miles on the car and we never had to replace the clutch.  It was a very easy clutch to drive.  In the time since we've had the car I've driven several other manual transmissions and only one car came close to being as easy to drive as this one.  The other car was a Masaritti  (sp?) BiTurbo that just happened to belong to a Masaritti mechanic.

Over all I enjoyed the Passat, but we seamed to be plagued with little problems.  We had trouble with the sunroof motor, the radio, the windshield wipers, the defroster, the heater, fuses, and a bunch of other stuff.  Everything was covered under warranty and with the exception of the defroster problem... nothing was a safety issue.  It was just a pain to have to take the car in for service all the time.  My husband says that Volkswagen has improved their quality control processes since we were VW owners, so if you buy a new car from them, I'm not sure if you will have the same issues.  However, if you're thinking of buying used.... be warned!

The car was very comfortable.  There was so much room I felt like I needed to install an intercom so the people in the front seat could talk to the people in the back seat!  The trunk was a nice size, too.

I enjoyed driving the Passat.  I liked the feeling of going up through the gears and hearing the engine rev.  It gave me a feeling of power and exhilaration that I don't feel driving my Mercedes Benz C230 Kompressor.  Even though the C230 is supercharged, the Passat is more visceral; it's a better driving experience.

If Volkswagen has really dealt with their QA issues, I might get another Passat when my C230 lease is up.  It was a real car.  It was a fun car.  It was a driving experience!
