            I needed a comfortable, reasonably priced car for my small (2 young children) family.  I knew Hondas are dependable, and the CR-V fit the bill perfectly. This may sound trivial, but there is one feature that i am most impressed with: The rear seat-backs adjust to a number of different incline positions, which makes it possible to get the babies' car seats in as tight as they need to be. I have read that up to 90% of car seats are installed and used improperly, and with the adjustable seatbacks in the Honda, i have been able to fit both carseats in incredibly tight. I am confident that my &quot;precious cargo&quot; is safe. 
I have had my 1999 CR-V for a year now, and have absolutely no problems with it. It is comfortable to drive and has enough power to get me on a busy freeway with ease. It feels as spacious as a bigger SUV, but is easier to park, and even fits in the &quot;compact&quot; spaces.
One feature i have not yet used is the built in picnic table. It might be handy someday, though, and i think it would be great for anyone who goes on picnics or camping trips.
Overall, i have been very impressed with this car.<br><br>
