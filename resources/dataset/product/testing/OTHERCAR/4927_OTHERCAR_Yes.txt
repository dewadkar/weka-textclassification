            I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm Phunk and I used to be a Chevy man.  I know, I know, for a man to switch teams so late in the game of life is almost unheard of, but I couldn't help it.

Background:  Back in December of 2001, we went looking for an SUV.  We take our dog, which happens to be a Great Dane, everywhere, and we were planning to have kids someday.  Not too mention that we wanted four wheel drive.  A SUV just made sense.  

We found ourselves at the Chevy dealer.  I have never liked the looks of the Blazer, and this was when the TrailBlazer just came out.  I didn't really care for the looks of that either, and the straight six made the price astronomical for that size of Chevy.  We loved the Tahoe, but couldn't justify $100 or more in payments.  I should add that not one salesman even asked us if we needed help.

Long story short, we bought the 4Runner.

Not too long ago, I decided that I was a Toyota man.  I went to my mechanic and we went into the confessional pit, and he told me that this was all right!  He told me about the parts costing more, but you have to replace them half the time.  Other than that, there wasn't much reason to stay with Chevy.  And no guilt!

Recently I bought a 1995 Tacoma.  It's nothing fancy, but it's really reliable and great on gas.  While I was waiting for delivery, the salesman offered me test drive in the Tundra.  I am hooked!  I'll take two please!

Power:  Having grown up on a ranch and farm, I like to think that I know a little about trucks.  I find the 240 hp and 315 lb/ft of torque in this full size to be plenty enough.  I would feel confident pulling most trailers and hauling anything in the bed.  After putting a bed liner in there, of course.  $30K is too much to pay for something that's going to get torn up everyday in the country.

Interior:  I absolutely love the interior of this truck.  Although I think I would have a problem putting a car seat in the back, I don't care.  That's why we have the 4Runner.  I felt comfortable in the hour that I drove it and feel like it would be a great traveling companion.  The ergonomics were good, too.  I felt like I was in control of everything.  One thing that has to be noticed on every Toyota product is the fit and finish of all the materials.  It seems that the materials themselves are top notch and all the gaps are minimal and even.  You feel like you're in a solid vehicle when you're in a Toyota.

Cargo:  The reason for buying a truck.  Although I like just about everything on this truck, I wouldn't want to have to rely on this bed as my only hauler.  The bed is just too shallow.  You could haul a lot more bales, or feed, or anything in the comparable trucks.  The bed is just too shallow.

That being said, now that I live in town, who cares?  I don't need to haul that much stuff.  To be honest, I drive a truck, because I've always driven a truck.  That's just what men drive out in the country.  Plus, you never can tell when you're going to need a truck.  I use mine every now and then, but not like I used to in the country.

Options:  As with any truck now days, you can option this baby out to your heart's content.  If you can't get it at the dealer's, you can sure find it in aftermarket.  For more information go to http://www.toyota.com and you'll be able to find whatever you're looking for.  You can even order a brochure from them and not worry about going to see a dealer and having the hassle of dealing with a salesman.

Overall:  Top notch.  I love this truck, bland styling and all.  I love the ride, I love the handling, and I love the power.  Although this truck can cost a little more than the big three, look at http://www.edmunds.com for more research.  According to their "True Cost to Own" research, it costs less to own this truck than the F150 (Ford), Silverado (Chevy), Sierra (GMC), and Ram (Dodge) over 5 years.  I would buy it anyway.
