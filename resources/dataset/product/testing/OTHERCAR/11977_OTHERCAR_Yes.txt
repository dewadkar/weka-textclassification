            My parents purchased this vehicle for me because it was affordable and sharp!  We got it used, but, it had everything in a car that I wanted.  It had an automatic sunroof, power windows and door locks, keyless entry, a standard transmission, AC, AM/FM/CD Stereo with Bose speakers, and it was a beautiful shade of dark green. When my Mom drove it for the first time, she couldn't believe that Dad agreed to give me a car with so much power.  And power, it has.  

About the power, I have raced everything I can get a race up with at red lights.  I win 8 of 10 times, beaten only by V8's.  Yes, my 4 cylinder can outrun a V6.  Gotta love that twin cam, dual over head engine.  Don't believe me?  Wanna try it out? Driving this vehicle is like flying, but on wheels.  It is smooth.

Anyone who wants a practical, sporty car that gets approx. 320 miles a fillup should buy this car. Although the GT's cost around 2,000 more than an SE, it would make a great 1st car or a great car to just cruise town in after retirement.  

Kudos to Pontiac for making my Sunfire mine.  It was my second car, and I plan on keeping it for more years to come.<br><br>
