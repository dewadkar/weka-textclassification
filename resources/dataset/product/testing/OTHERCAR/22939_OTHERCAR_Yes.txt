            I have two. A 93 9c1 cop car and a 95 LT1 wagon. I love them both. My wife drives the wagon because it is more luxurious, and I drive around in the cop car with it's stiffer suspension and lower axle ratio. They are both my type of car. Comfortable, safe, and fun to drive. Nice handling with rear wheel drive. They will both cruise safely at high speeds and they both have a very high level of built quality.  The high output 350 engine is a must and both of my cars have the 350. The 260 hp. Lt1 corvette type engine ( first available in 94 and last available in 96 ) is in the wagon and it has the most horsepower, but the cop car 205 hp. 4 bolt engine is very durable and is made to be driven at wide open throttle for an extended period of time.  

I want to give more information about the 93 9c1. It was purchased from the Kansas highway patrol about a year ago. The first impression is the feeling of being in something very solid with a high level of engineering. This is not a flimsy car with thin sheet metal, thin glass, and lots of plastic. It is a large and heavy car, but with excellent handling and a smooth ride. It takes on large bumps and dips with ease. Railroad road tracks feel like smooth pavement and you can even jump them at high speed if necessary. At higher speeds this car comes into itself. You feel like you are going at a much slower speed, but the car feels better as the speed picks up. The steering is very precise and the car holds the road like like an expensive sports car. However, the ride is flat and smooth on the straight away without jarring or jolting. Also, No tire noise, thumping or bumping. The entire car feels balanced and strong. A Caddy feels like a tin can in comparison. 

The big 350 engine has lots of torque for take off, towing or pushing, but it still returns 20 mpg on the highway due to the aerodynamic design of the body and windshield. You can come to a safe stop in seconds with the extra large 9c1 brakes with ABS and very good snow traction with all that weight. The frame is a thicker grade with extra body bushings for more strength and better protection in case of an accident. The transmission has a special feature that prevents it from down shifting out of overdrive lock-up at high speeds. This option provides direct horsepower and torque that is transmitted to the rear wheels through a special balanced driveshaft and gives a smooth 130+ top speed.

The bucket seats are well cushioned and comfortable for long distance driving. The interior is plain, but not cheap. The inside is quiet, but not silent, as I have put on a performance muffler. I love the deep rumble of the 350 V-8. The transmission is overbuilt with a shift kit and the rear axle is bigger. The 9c1 also has a heavy duty cooling system ( large radiator, oil cooler, transmission cooler and power steering cooler) and it always runs cool. Nevertheless, it has special silicon green water hoses that last the life of the car. I have not had any mechanical problems, but if I do, parts are easy to obtain with low costs. This is an easy car to work on. It is the best of Gm., combining the attributes of many different types of cars into one car. A total package that has been built to last longer and do more.

A nice Caprice with the 350 engine is getting harder to find. As the word spreads the demand is going up and the supply is going down. Buy while you still can.
