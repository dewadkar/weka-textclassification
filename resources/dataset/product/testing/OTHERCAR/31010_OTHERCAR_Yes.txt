            I previously owned a used 1993 Nissan Sentra so upping to the Dodge pickup was a big change. :)  We had been looking to buy a truck since we knew we wanted the advantages a truck offers.  Anything would have been better than our small 2 door.  We went to Ford first since everyone seems to have a Ford.  I hated the small beds that the 4 doors offered w/ford.  I wanted an all out truck w/4 doors and didn't want to skimp on the bed.  The only Ford's that I saw that had the 4 doors and big bed where way too much power for me.

So one day while surfing the internet I came upon the new Dodge.  It looked cool and so we went to look at it.

At first I was looking at the Dakotas but my husband fell in love with the Ram.  It's just a macho mans car!  :)  We bought the 2 wheel drive after realizing that the 4x4 was more than we needed and the cost was too high.  We took the SLT edition because we didn't like the leather seats that the SLT plus offered.  The cool thing about the SLT plus though is how the grill blends in the the color of the truck.

We got the regular bed after trying the long bed.  The long bed was just too long for us.  We live in an apartment complex and I couldn't imagine parking the long bed.

The only thing I wasn't expecting having never owned a truck before is the bumpy ride.  On the freeway it's definately not smooth.  I had my 18 month old newphew in the back seat and he loved the bumpy ride.  

Speaking of back seat...  this is a definate SUV type of truck.  Nothing is skimped on.  I do like that the back seat folds up for flat storage.  Also the Truck has a lot of storage.  In the front there is a middle fold down seat w/space for maps and an extra cell charger.  Lift the seat up and there is space for a first aid kit and cd case. :)

The displays are white during the day and at night it totally glows green which I really liked.  We opted for the security system that locks the doors automatically.  Which we love but have to rember to arm when we walk away.  There are console lights that you can have so that when you open the door lights on the inside automatically go on.  Or you can switch it off.  Also the doors lock automatically when you switch gears or go over 25mph.  

We bought an automatic and everything about the truck is perfect!!  The driver seat is totally adjustable and my mom drove the vehicle for a week while we were out of town and really liked the adjustable back support.

Driving the freeways today I still see more Fords than Dodge's but give it some time and I think that the new Dodge's will be all over the road. :)
