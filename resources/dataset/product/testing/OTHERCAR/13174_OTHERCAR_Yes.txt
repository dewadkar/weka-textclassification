            I purchased a new 2001 Millenia S (with the Miller Cycle S-Charged engine) in August 2001 and logged 26k miles.  I always wanted one and it was what I hoped for.  It is the smoothest and quietest car I driven in and I'm including some models of Lexus and Acura.  The styling inside is thoughtful and luxurious and the hardware is solid.  Heck, the whole car is solid.  I was going to buy a Lexus GS 300 which is also very nice but would have to buy one several years old to match the price of the discounted Millenia.  Plus, I found many luxury features comparable.  My only major regret there was that I could not get factory navigation on the Millenia, as I could on the Lexus.  But alas, the pocket PC has a turn-by-turn navigation option that I could use in any car.  I will buy one soon.

As for the particulars on the Millenia S, it has a 2.3L Miller Cycle V6 with a Lysome compressor (super charger) that delivers 210 horses.  The vehicle is a hefty 4200 pounds but this adds to safety and ride quality.  With my friend driving, I can sleep in the passengers seat for hours at a time.  I wake up not knowing where I am!  The vehicle has traction control for those snowy areas.  It also comes with a Bose, 10 speaker stereo that delivers 250 watts.  It sounds great.  As for acceleration, it's not incredibly quick off the line but will move at speed.  Great passing power and top end.

All in all a very nice car for the money.  The Millenia is still assembled in Japan unlike the 626.  I think the reliability should be very good.  The engine is exotic and well tuned so I take care of it by changing the oil often.  It was all I hoped for and more.
