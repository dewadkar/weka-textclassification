            My mom got a Nissan Sentra about two years ago ,its a 97, and she loves that car alot and i can see why its a great car for driving alot of miles because you get great miles per gallon. Also since she has had it its never been in the shop once so it is very durable. It also has alot of trunk space. A drawback though is the fact that its alittle small in the back seat but it would be fine for kids. And if you do put kids in the back it has child proof doors where you can lock the doors so you have to open them from outside. Over all i would say it a good car.<br><br>
