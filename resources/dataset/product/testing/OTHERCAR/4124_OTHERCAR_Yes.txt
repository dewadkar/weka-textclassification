            I just got a job working in sales for a brewery and I knew I needed a car with a lot of space in it, to lug cases, kegs, signage, t-shirts etc.  My last car had been a Mercury Sable, good in snow, but not very long lasting or good on mountain roads for all my weekend adventures.  After perusing the Consumer Reports site, I determined that the Nissan Pathfinder was the best way to get the most car and most reliability for my money.

I love the space and the ride.  It handles well, and even seems to turn sharper than my Sable.  Going into 4WD is easy.  In the 2WD mode, it is not great in snow, so I wind up switching a lot.  

All the space comes at a bit of a cost though, especially with the increasing oil prices.  Usually I get about 19 MPG.

The dash is well laid out, and the stereo is great, with a CD player.  The controls are very intuitive.  I have the XE, so only the barebones features.  But the car still feels fairly fancy, and still feels new after 45,000 miles.<br><br>
