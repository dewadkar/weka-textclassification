            The truck has a 6.0L gas engine that is perfectly suited for light duty work.  I use my truck for camping so it's rarely carrying a load.  Fuel economy is 10.5mpg city and 14.5mpg hwy.  My best tank was almost 16mpg averaging about 80mph on I5 between Orange and San Diego counties.  


I didn't get the diesel because I wouldn't reach the break even point until 7 years later.  This would be very different if I towed, hauled heavy loads, or put in a camper.  I'd imagine fuel economy would then dip into the single digits.  Combine that with the small 26gal tank and you'll be spending more time at gas stations than on the road.

I've owned and driven many 4WD trucks offroad and know the independent fronts suspension ("IFS") on the Chevy is much worse than the old solid front axle used on Dodge and 3/4T Ford trucks.  It offers almost zero suspension flex, causing the wheels to lose contact with the trail.  Combined with the very small OEM tires and the truck is significantly less capable with a locker than my stock '85 Suburban with open differentials.  

However, the suspension is ideal for on-road and washboard fire trails.  I've been on washboard trails w/ solid front axle equipped trucks where I could go no faster than 5mph for fear the truck would shake apart.  The IFS just eats this type of road for lunch.  Ditto speed bumps.  Hit a speed bump with a solid front axle equipped truck and you really feel it.  The IFS just rides over it with a mild thump.

A word about the OEM locker.  The OEM locker is the Eaton G-80 unit.  I'm not sure if it's just a renamed Gov-Lock.  But, the innards sure look like one.  The way they work is this:  When a wheel starts slipping, internal weights "fly" open, causing the differential to lock.  The problem is that the locking is very abrupt.  I can imagine that if you're offroading and lift a tire, you can make the unit self destruct in short order.  I've had the occasion where I've lifted a tire, causing the truck to start rolling backwards before the locker kicked in.  Then, you feel the truck lurch forward as the locker locks.  What's happening is that all the torque is being shock loaded to the one drive axle.  The G-80 is a 2-pinion design and will surely break if repeatedly subjected to what is considered very mild offroading.  

The truck has lousy ground clearance.  I scraped the frame riding on old fire and logging trails forcing me to look at an aftermarket suspension lift kit for the first time in my 20 years of driving 4x4 trucks.  The truck sits so low, I have to use jack stands when changing the oil.  

The fit and finish are, for the most part, very good.  The fender flares show a bit of a gap where they meet the sheetmetal.  But the interior is immaculate, the body panels are all aligned, the paint is flawless, the engine bay is well laid out, wiring is well laid out, and the undercarriage is fairly well thought out.  My only gripe is there is no skid plate for the gas tank.  A long wheelbase vehicle can expect to high center on a fairly regular basis.  This puts the plastic gas tank at great risk.  The skid plate package does not include a plate for the fuel tank.  Shame on GM for omitting this vital piece of equipment.  The switches have a good feel considering the vehicle price point though the dashboard light rheostat feels cheap and out of place.  

I have the 4L80E transmission.  I'm used to manual transmissions and am not at all impressed with this one.  The shifts are soft; it doesn't downshift soon enough on grades; it doesn't downshift automatically when in tow/haul mode like the Allison transmission does.  

I have 1 of the 4 trucks available in California (at the time) with the lever actuated transfer case.  I love it.  No buttons to fail; it shifts smoothly and on the fly.  The shift pattern is different from my other trucks where the patter from top to bottom is 2H-4H-N-4L.  The 2003 Silverado's shift pattern is 4L-N-2H-4H.  Also, with a manual trans, you can shift on the fly into 4L if you double clutch when shifting.  No can do with the auto.  

Another lament is the lack of manual hubs.  There have been times when I've left put a truck in 4L but kept the front hubs unlocked.  This is not a possibility with the current hub setup.  I think Ford still offers the manual hub option.

No one makes A/C like the domestic auto manufacturers.  This truck is no exception.  Turn on the A/C and it blows ice cubes in the hottest weather.  Even better is the cooling system.  I've climbed long, steep grades in temps over 100-deg F w/ the A/C blasting and the temp gauge didn't budge.  Just make sure you keep your cooling system well maintained or you can expect problems (http://www.consumeraffairs.com/automotive/gm_dexcool.html).

This truck, as equipped, is well suited for what I bought it for.  It sits a bit low to offroad.  But that problem is relatively easy to remedy, albeit at a significant cost (lift   tires and wheels = $3500 minimum).  The truck is too large to seriously offroad, so this is not a huge deal.  The ride, fit/finish, quality are all above expectation and on par with the imports.

I have the 40/20/40 front bench seat and love it.  I need seating for 6 and this truck is quite roomy.  The rear fold down seats allow 2 10-year old sized children to sleep in the rear section.  The cloth seats are more almost like a suede causing some concern re: durability.  

I did have one warranty claim the first week I had the truck.  An emissions hose came loose from the evap canister, causing the check engine light to come on.  It was an easy fix but caused a great deal of inconvenience.  The service writer, Brian Snell, of Martin Chevrolet, took excellent care of me.  I got a free rental car (Volvo V70) (after the rental yard was already closed!) and didn't have to fill the tank when I returned it.  He also let me bring the truck in on a Sunday and personally drove me back to my home.  If you live in the South Bay in California and need your Chevy/GMC vehicle serviced, ask for Brian Snell.  

I paid about $35,000 out the door which includes a 6/60000 warranty.  I get GMS pricing which is quite a few thousand dollars off the sticker price.
