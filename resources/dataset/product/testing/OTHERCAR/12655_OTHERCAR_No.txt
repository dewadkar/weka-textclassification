            I wanted a 2 door SUV, and wanted a domestic vehicle. Since at the time only Chevy/GMC offered a 2 door (now Ford does), and in spite of my many past problems with GM cars, I tried it. What a disaster.
The list of things that went wrong in its first 30,000 miles are: Wiper motor burned out, rear wiper stopped working, power mirror stopped working, coil failed (needed to be towed), front end loosened up (needed to be towed, light switch broke, the &quot;servic engine soon&quot; light came on twice(emissions problems). I think I've logged more miles up and down than horizontal.
The vehicle drives and rides great, but unless you are looking for the typical annoying General Motors problems, steer clear of this one.<br><br>
