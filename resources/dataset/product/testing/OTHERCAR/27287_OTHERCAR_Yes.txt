            When I was in Southern California, I grew to hate SUVs. Driving behind one made it impossible to see the traffic up ahead. Ending up between, or in front of SUVs is intimidating if you're in a small car. When I got to Israel, therefore, I was delighted to see very few of these monster vehicles on the road. 

My friend Ron, however, has a 2000 Dodge Durango. His work got it for him as he often has to take large quantities of computers and related materials. He recently took me camping with his family overnight. Once outside of Tel Aviv, I had a chance to drive. (Check out my review in the travel section on driving in Tel Aviv if you want to know why I waited til outside the city.) <a href='/trvl-review-37D-36C9D5F1-3A264FDB-prod3'>http://www.epinions.com/trvl-review-37D-36C9D5F1-3A264FDB-prod3</a>

On the plus size, there was lots of room in the Durango. Camping equipment, luggage, food, kids' stuff, and various miscellany fitted in with room to spare. We even fit in two kids (one still in a baby seat) and three adults comfortably. 

Also on the plus side was the pick up. This vehicle is a v-8 with 235 HP and you can feel it. For such a large vehicle, it moves well. 

Finally on the plus side is the looks. Unlike some SUVs this machine doesn't seem out of proportion. 

Now to the stuff I don't like. I'm short! Getting into this vehicle is physically challenging for a person as under-tall as myself. 

More seriously, because I was up so high, I felt like I'd lost sight of the area directly in front of the vehicle. I never knew exactly what was in front of the car. This wasn't bad when I was the only thing on the road, but would have been very scary had I been on a road with other vehicles and pedestrians...especially small children that might dart into traffic.

At slower speeds, the SUV felt stable. At faster speeds, however, it didn't feel so stable. 

This SUV cost about $28,000 I was told. Considering the cost of other such vehicles in this class, this is very reasonable. 

This is not an awful vehicle, but would not be my choice.

Finally, when we got home, we had to wash the Durango. Once more, because it is tall and I am not, it was hard to see what kind of job we were doing on top of the car. Of course, since no one else can see that, either (since you're so tall) you might not care. 

Overall, it's a lot more pleasant driving this vehicle than riding next to it. 

If you're going for an SUV, it might be worth checking out.
