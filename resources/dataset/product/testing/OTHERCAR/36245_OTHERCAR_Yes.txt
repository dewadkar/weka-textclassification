              Ok, I know, not alot of people hold the lowly Chevy Corsica in very high esteem. After all, it's just one of those cars most commonly found with middle-aged (or older) ladies behind the wheel to get back and forth to their secratorial jobs....I too, once never thought much of the Corsica until one came into our family. This '91 Corsica LT (with the 3.1-liter V6) replaced a '91 Ford Tempo that was slowly falling apart until a small wreck put it out of it's misery. Compared to the Tempo, the Corsica is nearly luxurious! It's really much more of a car than the Tempo was. Let me tell you why....

  To start with the looks, there's not much to say. It's a pretty unassuming car, no spoilers or wild paint jobs here. And I must say, that's part of it's secret. It's kind of nice, this gray sedan easily passes most cars, and cops don't seem to notice it much either. If you can live with the anonymity, you'll be able to catch alot of people by surprise.
  I do like this engine. It's quite torquey for a V6. Even though only making 135 horsepower, it's got 180lb-ft of torque. That's more than enough to squeal the tires real good off the line and be well on your way to 120mph....unless you let up when your sanity kicks back in. And I don't know if it's just this particular car, or if they all sound the same, but this one has an oddly, dare I say,--muscular sound while on it hard. It's a pleasant surprise to be hearing that sound out of such a car, and the 4-speed auto doesn't interfere too much, delivering quick, smooth, up or downshifts and I've never caught it hunting around. There's plenty of passing power on highway trips, and it's relatively fuel efficient at about 23mpg in the city, and around 30mpg on the highway. 
  On to the interior. Everything's pretty ergonomic, easy and simple to work the controls. The dash is nice and rounded, and the top of the passenger side has a little shelf you can set items on. Really handy for roadtrips. Also, there's a REALLY nifty pull out cup-holder built into the dash that hold two medium sized fast-food type cups. The instrumentation is ok, but for one exception. It has no tachometer. I like having that there, and this is completely lacking. Otherwise, it's ok, and easy to read. The seats are pretty good too, broad and supporting everywhere and covered in this nice thick fabric, which also covers the inside of the doors for a more upscale feel. This is obviously not a sportscar, but it's lightly bolstered on the sides of the back and on the seat part itself as well, so it's kind of a nice medium between sportscar and Buick bench seat. The greenhouse in this car is pretty decent, the front windshield slopes pretty well, so there's quite a bit of dash, and there's not quite so much in the back window, but it's far from claustrophobic feeling. One thing that really annoys me, this is one of those cars equipped with those infuriating rear windows that only go like 3/4 of the way down. I know it's supposed to serve a purpose, but it's a pain. It'd be real nice if you could turn it on or off. Continuing on, the rear seats aren't bad, and rear leg room is pretty decent. Trunk space is nearly cavernous.
  Now to how it drives: umm, in a word, like a daily transportation sedan drives. It's not bad, but it's not particularly good, either. The steering is rather heavy, and the suspension doesn't communicate with the driver, or offer much of a sporting personality. It does ride pretty nice, soaking up most road imperfections, and managing to do it pretty quietly, it just won't make you long for the end of the work day so you can go carve up some twisties.
  The stereo/tape player's pretty good too. I'm pretty sure it's stock from the looks of it, but it's got some range, and some nice bass. 

   All in all, it's a good car and very reliable. It's got plenty of engine (In LT V6 form anyways) and it'll surprise you with what it'll do, performance wise. It now has 115k on it, and in the 8,000 or so miles we've put on it, it hasn't needed anything but regular oil changes and an occasional ac check and tune up. I'd definitely recommend this car, and give it a 3.5 for the good car it is, but not as good as it could be.<br><br>
