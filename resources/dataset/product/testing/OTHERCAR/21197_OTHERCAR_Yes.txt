            I felt like an idiot. I got to my car, after purchasing the Vivitar ViviCam 3715, and completely overlooked the zoom capability before I bought the camera. 

My chihuahua, Toni, was laying in the seat beside me, annoyed that I was so wrapped up in something other than her. But Toni quickly got used to this new toy, that wasn't much smaller than her, when she became the model. I snapped a few shots of her, still bewildered about not having any zoom. Much to my surprise, the ViviCam features a 4X digital zoom. The only drawback to the digital zoom, is the need for the LCD screen. This leads me to another issue that can be easily avoided.

Battery life. It seems to be an issue for every camera these days. The longer the camera is left on, the faster the batteries drain. Rechargeable batteries are the most practical way to go. You should look for ways to conserve battery life. A suggestion is, when uploading pictures to your computer, make sure to turn your camera off after everything is uploaded&#150or, purchase a DC adapter.

For those not computer savvy, fear not! The camera pops up like a drive on XP and OS X&#150just think of it as accessing a floppy or CD-ROM. 

I'd also like to point out, that Mac users (like myself) should be happy since this camera is both Windows and Mac-friendly.

Another feature includes short movie clips (less than 60 sec). While these clips are audio-free, it's a nice addition to have fun with. Keep in mind that this will take up a good deal of memory&#150and internal memory is only 8MB. But not to worry&#150there is a media card slot for those willing to pay another $20 for extra space. It's definitely worth it, especially if you're going on a long trip with no computer access!

Another great addition is the <a href="/content_91234406020">HP PhotoSmart 230</a>, which prints gorgeous pictures from this ViviCam&#150no computer even needed! My mother carries her compact printer around in a camcorder case, and she never fails to impress anyone with her little gadget!
