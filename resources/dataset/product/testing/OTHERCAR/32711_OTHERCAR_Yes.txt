              I have been waiting for a camera that was easy to use but still had all the new features and technology added on to it.  Then I found the RCA CDS4100.  This camera has it all, some of the features that it has are -

* Auto focus

* 2 LCD screen

* 2x Digital zooms

* 1.5 mega pixel resolution (1360 x 1024)

* Auto flash

* Long lasting Duracell ultra battery

* Cords, hookups, included
 
* Auto exposure and Auto White balance


 This camera is definitely one of the best I have ever used.  It is so easy to use and it is so great.  There are a few things that I found difficult to use on this camera but once I figured it out I thought it was very easy.  This camera is both easy but amazing to use and I know that anyone out there who is thinking about buying a new camera then this one is a great choice.  I know that this camera will give you no problems and will be great.
