            The A4 Manual 2.8 litre
This car rocks!!! At around $20,000 it is a great buy!
If you are looking for top-level class at an affordable price this is your car.  I purchased my A4 for around $20,000.  The car only had 37,000 miles on it.  One prior owner (Audi Sales Rep.) I think that you should be able to find this car in the same price range give or take miles and features.  Do not settle for this car at $25,000 you can find it for less, although the A4 is a hot ticket.  Most should be loaded with options.  Manual may be hard to find as they sell first.


I drive only manual, I upgraded from a 4 cylinder to a 6 in this car.  My Audi is fully loaded as are most.  It is the best purchase I have made in my life to date.  Every time I get behind the wheel I enjoying driving it.  The car looks good, handles even better and has an engine that gives you what you want.  Check out the Audi website http://www.audiusa.com/cars/a4index.htm. As well, several home pages from A4 lovers can be reached from most browser searches. Just enter Audi A4.

Pro's to Buying the 1997 Audi A4:
�	You get a classic outer body design.  The A4 design is the same   
        all the way through 2001.  Slight body modifications (front fog
        lamps in 2000 and 2001) are not noticed by anyone who does not 
        know the Audi.  Basically you're getting a three year old car 
        that looks brand new for half the price.  Some would buy new at 
        the $20,000 price and miss out on the A4.
�	As with most high end cars you get lots of luxuries.  Audi has 
        them; Power windows, Sunroof, Cold weather package, ski bag, 
        heated seats, Power adjustable drivers seat and many more things 
        you can read about on the Audi home page. You get all this in 
        1997.
�	Maintenance - My car came with the complete service record kept 
        by the previous owner.  Make sure you buy the car with this 
        included. (Almost prevents any lemons if you know the service 
        history).  Audi like all high end cars can run past the time you wish to own them if you follow the scheduled maintenance.  The maintenance may cost more than the average $20,000 car but, it will insure that you drive in style for years to come.
�	Fun to drive - I should have put this first! If you buy cars to drive (rather than just shuttling yourself around) this car will not disappoint you.  This sedan is more sport than sedan.  It is the zip a man is looking for in his mundane daily schedules.  Some days I just look forward to driving home the long way. 
�	Power under the hood - This car has got it.  The 2.8 has horse power at 180. It is a V6. It can move off the light when you need it. However, I have had trouble with same aged Saab Turbo's and Audi 1.8T's.  Check the specs for 0-60 on the websites.  My car still has the power after three years. Colorado has many upward drives and the A4 2.8 has never left me wanting more power.  I can rapidly accelerate uphill without problems, overtaking traffic along the way to the slopes.  

Other Car's I  considered:
Other cars I looked at were 1997 and 1996: BMW 325i, Saab 900, 900SE, Audi A6, Volvo 850
�	BMW offered standard BMW features for about $9,000 more.  Not worth it when I could get 4-wheel drive for $20,000.  The car is a BMW, costs are more for image, and insurance. I wanted a nice car, but I am not a sucker. 
�	The Saab's I looked at were the 900 and 900SE - both front wheel drive.  I liked the cars, but they did not seem to have the same kick as the Audi.  The Saab's I looked at were about $4,000 to $3,000 less than the Audi.  Price was on Saab's side. The Turbo 900SE was a my second choice.  Fast car, nice car. It lost out because it just did not seem as new, and fresh.  Not to mention that Saab changed its body style in 2000 with new numbering and series. Saab's also do funny things with the ignition key and dash readouts.  As much a I wanted to like this, &quot;To act all Euro&quot; I am practical.  I also wanted four doors.  The four Saab's loose the style of Saab.  
�	Volvo 850 - bigger car, heavier car, costs a little more (couple of grand), not in the same class as the A4. This car is more for the family man.  I can see myself in the future driving a Cross County wagon with the kids, but not an 850.  My girlfriend drives the 1997, 850 GLT and loves it.  She is not into speed and sport and much as I am.
�	Audi A6 - too big and heavy of a car, cost a couple of grand more as well.  I felt like I was an old man in my late 40's. The A6 is a family car and I am a single man!

Rule of Thumb, do not buy too old unless you buy Porsche.  Buy used at three years nothing older.  Most often you will get the car before much work is needed and then you can control the decline of the auto. Some cars may even have the factory warranties. Buy around half of the new selling price.  Make sure the books are kept and service records can be traced.  Do not buy a car that has not been serviced buy the dealer. Follow this and it should feel like a new car for at least your first year of ownership.

Why Audi A4 2.8, 1997:
�	I went with the A4 for one main reason, I live in Colorado and need 4-wheel drive (Quattro).  BMW, Volvo, Saab, Mercedes and Volkswagen do not have this for the price.  New 2001 VW Jetta and Pessot do have 4-wheel dive for the price range but it is a lower standard of car. BMW is releasing a 2001 4-wheel drive, but I am sure it will be sky high in price.
�	Second, the look, style and design is a modern classic.  Four years from now it will still look like a new car.  When I sell it, the 2001 (looking very much the same car) will still be on the road and my resell will be good.
�	Audi is top of the line, it rivals BMW, Volvo, Saab and Mercedes in Luxury, Style, Handling.  It is more a sports car than a sedan, very similar to the BMW 300 series.  The A4 is fun, with zip and get up.
�	Trust, I had great trust in the VW name and VW owns Audi and Porsche.  I just wanted to drive something other than VW.  I am glad I did!  I am sold on Audi. 

Note:
I previously owned a 1992 Volkswagen Jetta GL.  I loved the car.  It just got old and I did not want to pay to maintain an old car.  The car ran great.  Sold it for $2,500 with over 150,000 miles on it.  The car had a solid engine. I could have drove it for at least 3 more years with less than $2,000 grand worth of maintenance.
