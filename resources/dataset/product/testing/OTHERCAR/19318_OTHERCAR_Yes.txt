            I tend to be a camera crazy type of person.  In my rather short lifetime, I've accumulated 4 or 5 cameras that I love and covet.  I have most all types - a Polaroid, a small fixed-focus point-and-shoot 35 mm, a Canon Elan II SLR, and a Canon Elph Jr. APS camera.  My latest addition, though, came this Christmas when my father bought me a Fuji FinePix 1400 Zoom.

Of course, I had been reading about digital cameras for a while.  I had even thought of buying one over the summer.  But then I had decided that what I REALLY wanted was a Nikon 880 or 990, and unfortunately that fell quite a bit outside my price range.  So I made do with my other cameras.

But that didn't stop me from putting the Nikons on my Christmas list.  But dad decided that they were a little much even for him to spend, so he searched out a more reasonably priced alternative.  

I have to admit I was a tad disappointed when I opened the box Christmas morning.  I was afraid that this camera wouldn't measure up to my "serious" photography needs.  It offered much less control than I was accustomed to from using my SLR.  And the resolution was less than the highest available at the time, which to me equaled - it must suck.

But this camera became so much fun.  I never realized how much I worried about "wasting pictures" and paying for film and developing with my other cameras.  I take so many more fun snapshots with this camera than I ever have before.  I have a huge archive of pictures of my family and friends that I'm sure I would have never taken with another camera.  

Instead of taking 3 or 4 pictures per occaision, I can afford to take 30 or 40.  Sure, some of them come out poorly, but then it doesn't matter cause I just delete them.  

The USB connection is really a good thing.  Especially because I have a Mac, which doesn't have parallel port capability, I would have had to purchase a USB reader for the media.  USB is also a lot faster than parallel ports, so I've heard, so it is definitely something you want if you don't want to be eating your batteries transferring.

The camera came with a 4 MB SmartMedia card.  It's not very big.  I have a 16 MB which gives me a total of 20 MB.  I've never run out of room for pictures, but I've never taken this camera on a long trip, so I'm never that far away from my computer.

Another thing you probably want is rechargeable batteries.  I got mine at RadioShack, with a charger.  And they last surprisingly long, considering what horror stories I had heard about digital cameras eating batteries.  

The camera has several flash modes - automatic, flash on, flash off, red-eye reduction, and night flash mode.  Night flash mode uses the flash but leaves the shutter open a long time to allow background scenes to show up.  I have found that I get a lot of red-eye with this camera.  More on me personally, though, than other people I'm taking pictures of, I guess because I have light eyes.

This camera also has a macro function that lets you take close-up pictures of things.  It can get pretty close to things, which can be fun.  But the flash doesn't work real well in these circumstances because it's too far off to the side.  

One thing that annoys me about this camera, though, is the lens cover.  It seems that the camera should turn on when you open the lens cover (like the clamshell Olympus point-and-shoots), but it doesn't.  You have to both open the lens cover and turn the camera on to take pictures.  

Another thing that's bothers me is the cover for the battery compartment gets stuck if you put the batteries in the wrong way.  Which seems to happen to me a lot, thanks to the confusing diagrams on there.  

I can't really attest to how well the pictures print at this resolution.  I don't have a real great printer, so I haven't printed too many.  And the ones I have printed have been at only about a 4 x 6 size.  I have found that the color reliability on my monitor has been excellent - much better, I think, than any type of film I've ever tried.  Which amazes me considering what a "cheap" camera it is.

But overall, I have had so much fun with this camera.  I still want a Nikon.  I'm still asking for one as my graduation present.  But I'm still awfully glad to have my little Fuji.
