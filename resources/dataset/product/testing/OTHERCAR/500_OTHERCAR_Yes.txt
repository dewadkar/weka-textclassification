                 This epinion is about the 1994 Pontiac Bonneville SSEi. The top of the line in Bonnevilles. With the "SSEi" nonmenclature you get a more aggressive road presence achieved by more aggressive lower-side body cladding, a rear spoiler, dual exhaust, the fog lights, and 16 inch wheels. The crown jewel of the SSEi package is the addition of a supercharger to the already great standard 3.8-liter V6. This engine produces enough power to quickly accelerate into traffic, or pass uphill, without having to go through any turbo lag. Mash the pedal, and in an instant the excellent 4-speed auto transmission downshifts creating a nice, aggressive throaty note as it obliges you and gently presses you against the back of the seat. Sure it's pushrod, and the engine's been around for quite a while, but it's by no means outdated. It more than holds its own when compared to cars like the Accord or Camry powerwise, and in reliability. I've heard of many 3.8s being driven 200,000+. 

    I love the design of the Bonneville SSEi. I still think it simply looks sharper, and exhibits more personality and flair in it's design than does any of it's Japanese rivals.
   
    The cockpit is very fighter-pilot like, with it's red instrumentation at night, and all it's gadgets. It's also very driver-oriented, with everything you could want or need to see right there in front of you. The views from around are all good, from the good position the seat's in. You don't feel like you're sitting in a bathtub.
    
   I love the seats, they're perfectly stuffed, and they're wide. I'm by no means a large person, but it's nice to have seats that you can get comfortable in on long trips.
   
   And speaking of long trips, this is something the Bonneville SSEi is perfectly suited for, with it's comfortable roomy interior, smooth, road-hugging ride, and superb engine that just lopes on highway miles. It also gets pretty good gas mileage too, with my average of around 19 in the city and 24-25 mpg on the highway, and can go upwards of 300 miles on one full tank.

   The stereo system on mine is the AM/FM stereo with the Equalizer. It still sounds good, providing good bass and a nice sound overall, in my opinion.
   
   A word of caution, MSN's Auto feature says that Bonnevilles have moderate problems with the engine in the failure of the EGR Passages. They also have moderate problems in starting and charging due to the Ignition Lock Cylinder which prevents the vehicle from starting, and significant problems on brakes where the Antilock Brake System (ABS) Pressure Modulator Valve (PMV) and the ABS Relay can fail. They give the Bonneville a 4 out of 5 on reliability, which I agree with. Just have a mechanic check out the Bonneville you're looking at and make sure that you're not gonna be having these problems.
