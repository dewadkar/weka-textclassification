            I bought a '92 Protege when I was a senior in high school.  It was my first brand new car, and I loved it.  I paid $13,000 for it.  Within the first year I had to bring it back to the dealer FOUR times for acceleration problems.  Every time, the mechanic found nothing wrong with the car.  Eventually, the problem just went away.  I have gone through 2 steering columns since 1998. I have heard many great things about the car from other owners, but my personal experience is not that great.  I have low mileage on the car for it's age but there is always something wrong with it.  As a college student, I don't usually have the money to bring it to get fixed, so it goes ignored.  I know that is only making it worse, but I really have no choice.  If I had bought a more reliable car, I would not be in this situation.  
I have to give this car some credit though. I get very good gas mileage. This car is comfortable for long trips and has lots of room.  <br><br>
