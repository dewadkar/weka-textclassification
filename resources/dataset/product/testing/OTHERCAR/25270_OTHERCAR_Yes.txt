            We bought our 1999 Land Cruiser (including third seat, moonroof and V8) in December of 1998 and have, for the most part, enjoyed it immensely. We bought it for more roominess and the ability to haul my dogs to shows.  At one point I had myself, my handler, two dobermans, a giant schnauzer and three large suitcases in it!  It is very good on these pot-holey, sometimes icy/snowy Pittsburgh roads, and offers a great vantage point.
 
It is an expensive car, and I don't know that it is worth the price, although for comfort and style it is wonderful.  I am disappointed with the problems that we've had -- I had an Accord LX before this and it was NEVER ONCE problematic.  

Add'l Comments:

We sold the LC in Spring 2000 and I got a Limited Isuzu Trooper for its smaller size.  Although the Trooper is a very nice car, I have found out that I am expecting again and will be going back to LC!  The third seat will really be great to have again and I will appreciate the three seat belts w/ shoulder harnesses in the second row immensely.

I didn't realize how absolutely luxurious the LC was until I downsized -- I'd be willing to bet that NO SUV ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH rides as smoothly as the LC, except maybe it's close cousin, the Lexus SUV.

Let me edit my previous statements -- if you CAN afford it, it is worth every penny!<br><br>
