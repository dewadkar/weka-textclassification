            After graduating from college, I felt that it was time to buy a new automobile.  I was not sure what I was looking for and it went from SUVs to sports cars and finally to a brand new 2000 silvermist Grand Am SE.  I love it!

I travel from Indiana to Wisconsin and with the winters in Wisconsin, I wanted something that was durable.  I have owned GM cars before, and found that they held up very well.  The Grand Am specifically was recommended to me by a friend who just bought a new 99 in July.  I decided to take a look.

Once I was in the Grand Am, I felt at home!  It was spacious, yet sporty, and felt like a very high quality vehicle.  The V6 gave me an extra pickup that I missed with my former car.  

Personally, I feel that the Grand Am is an overall great car.  The ride is very smooth and the safety features are numerous including, &quot;lock&quot; windows, child protection locks, dual air bags, and adjustable seatbelts.  The one added thing that I wish that the new Grand Ams had is a interior gas tank cover release.  The other thing is that since i have bought my Grand Am, I see them every where, I guess that is a plus and a minus.

This is the perfect car for me, but I also feel that people who are starting a family would enjoy what the Pontiac Grand Am SE has to offer.<br><br>
