            I have now owned three Jeep Grand Cherokee's. I bought a new 1994 JGC Laredo V8 with towing package. It served me well, but cost about $26000 new. I sold that one for $12,500, to get into a 1996 Red JGC Laredo because my wife has had two back operations. The 1996 has an adjustable lumbar support operated with a switch and a little motor. She feels the entire seat gives her better support and comfort. The 1996 is an inline 6, the 4.0 liter engine. I was a little skeptical about going down to the six after being used to the Dodge 318 5.2 liter engine in my 1994 JGC. I was amazed how peppy that engine is and I have no problem passing 3 or 4 cars traveling a little too slow for me. The other thing that convinced me the six is good, was the experience of a coworker of mine. He has a Jeep Cherokee with the same 4.0 liter engine with over 300,000 miles. He told me only routine maintenance was done on his engine. I want a car that will give many miles of good service. My trusted mechanic doing the service also felt the six was a better engine than the V8. That guy is an independent that does great work and gets all customers by word of mouth.
Finally, the 1996 cost me $16,200 about 16 months ago. I got it from a decent small dealer who was only making about $1000 to $1500 per car he sold. I think this was fair.

(Recently, I bought another 1994 JGC, but with leather and all the Limited goodies inside. It looks like a Laredo on the outside.)

So, I probably saved about $12,000 by buying a high quality used SUV that is built well and has an excellent engine that will last for years. The car had 71,000 miles when I purchased it. I now have 112,000 miles on it with only oil changes and one tuneup as service.

The plastic covered bumpers and the plastic along the sides is a great benefit also. In our Michigan winters, snow sticks to the bottom of cars especially around the wheel wells. When I get home, or in any parking lot, I can kick the plastic and the bulk of the snow pack falls off. The plastic has some give to it that breaks of the ice and snow chunks without any damage. The plastic along the lower part of the doors protects the metal and paint in parking lots. If I swing my door open too far, plastic touches the car next to me. No damage to their paint. If that guy hits my door, he bangs my plastic - no damage.

I got the Infinity sound system - 8 speakers, cassette,one CD at a time. The sound quality is excellent for me; better than my home system. The sound is warm, full, clear, but not overwhelming. I love to go for a drive with my wife and just listen to our favorite music.

I got 17.5 mpg over 8,000 miles of mostly around town driving. This is from the onboard computer above the rear view mirror. It works in English and metric. It's fun to see how many liters per 100KM I get. It also shows outside temp, miles until gas tank is empty, current mpg (it goes to 99 when slowing down for an offramp), and a couple other readings.

I was amazed how well this vehicle corners. On a cloverleaf curve I go around it at about 45 to 47 mph with minimal sway. A passenger also commented that he could not believe how tight the turning ratio was. I could do a u-turn in two lanes, even with parked cars on either side. And I have a choice of 2 wheel drive, part time 4 wheel, and full time 4 wheel drive.

The only thing I do not like about it is the rear windshield wiper. It often does not even touch the window. The spring loaded hinge gets gummed up and rusted up. After cleaning and some WD40, it works for a while, but not very long.

If you plan to buy a used vehicle, buy the highest quality you can afford. A car that is well built and was expensive new can give many good years of luxurious service for those of us that cannot afford the $10000 to $15000 more that the new car would cost.<br><br>
