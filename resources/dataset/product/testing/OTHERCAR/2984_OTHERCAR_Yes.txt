            We bought this Jeep to replace a Ford Ranger, because it had a back seat.  Small, but it is there.  The back seat was for the kids' carseats.  Well, it had a soft top when we bought it.  It was neat, except that is was extremely noisy going down the highway at 70 MPH.  

I tell you, this thing would go straight up a hill if you wanted it to.  I know it will, because we did it once.  We were on our way to a funeral, and stopped to get gas in a little town.  We took the back way home and ended up in some sand dunes.  We went up this hill that was almost vertical.  Seriously, we could only see the sky as we began to climb.  I was scared, I admit.  But not as much as when we topped the hill and looked straight down to the ground below.  But, you can't exactly back UP a hill, so we went down.  Needless to say, we are safe, but I know this vehicle will do anything.

I have found is the best off-road rig I have ever driven.  It has a wider wheelbase than the CJ-7's, so it is safer.  You can also put on wider tires to make it even more stable.  It will handle 16&quot; tires, although you do compromise some safety by raising it off the ground.  

We bought a Targa-top for our Wrangler, and it is subsequently more quiet, in fact, it seems like the engine noise is even cut out some.  Being an off-road vehicle, it doesn't get great gas mileage, but we usually knock down at least 25 MPG.  If you change the oil every 3000 miles, and treat it well, these things really perform. 

We had problems with our door handles and locks on the inside.  The problem was when it got real dusty, the doors wouldn't lock, so we had to take the door panel off and clean out the lock mechanism.  It only took about 5 minutes, but WD-40 cleared up the problem.  We have over 90,000 miles on ours and it still runs like brand new.  

We have an inline-6 in ours, which gives it more horsepower than the V-6.  It will pull a 4&quot; X 8&quot; trailer full of wood at 60MPH with no problem.  It won't pull a loaded 2-horse trailer, but that is not what it is designed for.  It is designed to be fun and take you places a puny Suzuki would stall just looking at.  That is exactly what it does.
