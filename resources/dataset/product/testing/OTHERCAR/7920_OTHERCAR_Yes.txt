            The Civic Si hatchback is based on the new Honda Civic which was redesigned for 2001.  The Si features its own engine that is not available to other Civics, a sport suspension, standard anti-lock brakes and a sunroof.

<b>EXTERIOR</b>: The Civic Si's design seems more European than Japanese to me.  This is mainly because the Si is BUILT in England!  It looks very similar to an Alfa Romeo 147, but then again, that is a GOOD thing.  Although the Si is based on the Civic, it is shorter, narrower, and slightly lower than the sedan.  The standard 15-inch alloy wheels are nicely designed, but larger wheels and tires would sportier on the Si.

<b>INTERIOR</b>: The Si is good a muffling wind and tire noise, but the engine is rather loud especially at high rpms.  The interior is borderline perfect when it comes to ergonomics, and the controls/gauges are very stylish and sporty.  The only gripe that I have about the interior is that the steering wheel tends to block some gauges in certain positions.  The smooth 5-speed manual's shifter "sprouts" out of the dashboard (rally-style), not the console like most cars.  Although the placement is odd, the shifter itself feels great and shifts very smoothly.

The Si has headroom that is par with others in its class, but is nonetheless confining especially for tall drivers like myself.  The doors are rather long, but not as heavy as most other coupes doors.  The Si's seats are very comfortable and supportive, and provide excellent lateral support when cornering hard.  The rear seats have very little leg room for tall people, but strangely, has more room than the Civic coupe!  Getting in and out of the back is hassle, but once inside, the rear seats are just as comfortable as the front seats.  The Si has 21.6 cubic feet of cargo space making it very versatile for such a small car.  The 60/40 split-folding rear seats also add to the everyday usability of the car.

<b>ENGINE</b>: The Civic Si hatchback is powered by a 2.0-liter, i-VTEC, inline 4-cylinder engine.  It puts out 160 horsepower at 6,500 rpm, and 132 lb./ft. of torque at 5,000 rpm.  It is mated only to a 5-speed manual transmission.  Weighing in at 2,744 pounds, the Si can feel a bit a bit sluggish under 3,000 rpm, but otherwise is quick.  Passing requires a MANDATORY downshift if you are in too high of a gear.  I averaged 24.8 miles per gallon on the recommended regular fuel.

<b>HANDLING</b>: All new Civics use a simpler, less expensive suspension design than the previous generation.  Unfortunately, noticeable amounts of body lean spoil what is otherwise an pretty good handling car.  The 195/60VR-15 tires provide excellent grip in the corners, but tire squeal and understeer is noticeable in hard cornering.  The steering is perfect, not too heavy, not too light, and adds to the fun of driving this car.  Overall, the Si is very fun-to-drive, but larger, low-profile tires would REALLY make the Si an exciting car.

<b>RIDE</b>: The ride in the Si is not unduly stiff, but bumps have the tendency to register through the steering wheel.  In most conditions, the Si rides rather comfortably.  This is uncharacteristic for a hatchback that has a short-wheelbase and a sport suspension!

<b>RELIABILITY</b>: Honda's are very reliable cars in general.  So far, the Si has had no problems or recalls and I do not expect any anytime soon.

<b>VALUE</b>: The Civic Si is an excellent sport hatchback.  It combines comfort, reliability, performance, and great gas mileage all in one small, fun-to-drive package.  It even has the added safety of optional side airbags.
