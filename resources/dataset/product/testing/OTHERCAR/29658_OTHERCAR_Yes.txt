            One year/18K mile update:

A year ago I decided upon the T&C EX at about $2K less than Odyssey EX.  I have yet to regret that decision.  I refer occasionally to the Odyssey EX because it and the T&C are presently the best overall vans out there.

My wife avoided our last van like the plague (2000 T&C Limited-former T&C design).  I shuttle the kids so I drive the van.  She has taken to this re-design of the T&C and doesn't object in the least when she needs it.  The re-design brought many improvements.

I might have gone for another Limited but $10K extra does not buy $10K worth of options. Moreover, I've gotten over van phobia and realize a few more bells and whistles will not make me feel better about scooting around in a van.  The LXi is more cash as well and certainly does not warrant the extra expenditure beyond an EX.  The EX is stacked sufficiently with performance, luxury, practicality, and style.

The EX offers the best, or perhaps most necessary, included options available in the T&C line.  Many of these included options are found on the significantly higher priced T&C LXi and Limited models:

> top power-plant (3.8 liter)
> auto doors w/ safety reversal (rear & passenger side)
> overhead center console (temp, fuel calculations, compass, trip, trip timing, shades stash)
> portable mid powered floor console w/ cell holder
> alloy 16" wheels
> plastic bag hooks (front and rear)
> vanity lights (including rear compartment illumination)
> stereo/cd
> front map lights
> storage box under passenger seat
> tinted windows (mid-to-back, helps AC considerably)
> power heated rear-view mirrors
> various power outlets
> 8-way power driver seat
> adjustable steering
> zone climate control (driver/front pssngr/rear individual)
> front & rear defrost
> rear variable wiper
> durable total coverage floor mats
> adjustable roof rack-easy to adjust

What T&C EX does for me that other vans do not:
Styling - about as sharp, unashamed looking as a van can get.
Value - value priced over competitors-more for the money (actually $2K less than the Odyssey EX).
Handling/Ride - more inviting, pleasurable, sweet manners for a van (very car/large sedan-like) and ride is limo-like.
Transmission/Engine - smooth, appropriate shifting tied to a powerful, moderately economical engine (18+ mpg average in city/highway equal combo).
Sound - more pleasurable, dead quiet, allowing normal voices (cd/stereo/ent system fills the cabin with broad and balanced range-movie sound is exceptional).
Maintenance - reliable with one dealer visit thus far to replace an electrical connector.

No, the rear seat don't disappear in the T&C as it does in the Odyssey.  Chrysler at least split the rear into two weighing about 55 lbs. each and made removal/install easy, so I'm not bothered.  Plus one seat (50%) in the T&C can stay in rather than having to go with all or nothing.

I've had this van on a long trip (2K+ miles).  I did not mentally or physically tire of driving it.  Wife and kids could not have been happier.  Took the long, severe uphill grades with ease despite having it loaded down to the max and AC working hard.  Took the long, severe downhill hill grades, with cruise engaged, at no more than 5 mph above the set speed (no braking-the transmission handles it).

The exterior finish is durable.  Any number of projectiles
have pelted the paint and nothing has appeared (white finish).  The interior seats are as firm as ever and the fabric has withstood the kids (cloth-cleans easily).  The windshield is durable-no chips (this matters to you if you've had a Honda).

For a van, the T&C is attractive.  More so in more ways than any other van out there right now.  It speaks 'car comfort' to me.  It's at the very least quality-driven in design and inviting to the approach.
