            <b>Why It Rocks!</b>
I bought the Sony DSC U20 for one reason: its tiny size. I wanted a camera that I could carry around everywhere, and this was that. Including the battery and the Memory Stick, the Sony DSC U20 weighs a scant 4.3 ounces. When it's in my pocket, I can barely notice that it is there. The flash is bright enough and its 2 megapixels are great for web publishing as well as making 4x6 prints. From opening the lens (power-up) to snapping a picture is only about 4-5 seconds.

<b>Get The Picture?</b>
When there is plenty of light, the Sony DSC U20 takes great pictures. The pictures are crisp with vivid colors and accurate focusing. When there isn't a lot of light, however, everything suffers. The camera has a difficult time focusing, and even when focused the pictures turn out grainy with little detail. I walked around Old Town Pasadena (well lit streets) and took several snapshots of my friends, and none of them had great detail. The picture quality was very poor in low light situations.

<b>Are We Friends Yet?</b>
The camera is quite user friendly. At the top are just 3 buttons: mode select (playback, record still pics, record movie), shutter, power (you can also power up by simply opening the lens). At the back is the LCD and the menu buttons. All of the menu entries are controlled by two buttons and a scroll up/down button. Even though learning the operations is easy, the buttons are too small for the average adult fingers. The LCD is also too small. While you will be able to differentiate from one picture to another, you won't be able to tell if the picture is in focus. Sony could have at least given a zoom option so that you can check the focus, but maybe the 1" screen was too small for even that. Furthermore, two lines of text (filename, date & time) fill the bottom 1/3 of the screen so you miss a lot of the details in the playback.

<b>Picky! Picky! Picky!</b>
If I were to complain about other things, they would be:
* Batteries drain too quickly.
* The lens cover can easily be opened accidentally (while in pocket).
* Memory Stick is less convenient than Compact Flash or Smart Media.
* Battery meter not very accurate.
* Formatting the 128MB Memory Stick takes very long.
* No 

<b>UPDATE</b>
Because of the many shortcomings, this camera has been discontinued. Hopefully the new model, the DSC-U30, fixes many of the problems of the discontinued model, especially the picture quality in low light situations.
