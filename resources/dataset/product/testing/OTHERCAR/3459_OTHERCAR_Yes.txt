            My friend picked me up from the airport and casually announced I should look for the red Acura.  &quot;Acura???&quot; I thought, but he wanted a BMW.  I met him outside and jumped in the car.  Before we had left the airport I was hooked.  

This is an amazing car!  As a passenger, it is comfortable (luxurious of course) and fun!  There are toys everywhere to play with.  The Navigation system is top notch and casually lets you know when you miss your exit and the easiest way to fix your route.  It will tell you where restaurants are, the nearest gas station, even an ATM.  And more, it is easy to use.  The navigation system operates on a single DVD, so you have the entire USA ready to be mapped for any trip you decide to take.  And another cool thing is that the DVD player can play any DVD, so think Mission Impossible movies for that next road trip!

After tiring myself out playing with all the gadgets in the car, I realized, &quot;Hey, this is much nicer than the Acura I looked at last year!&quot;  I bought a new car a year and a half ago and started my search out at the Acura dealer.  The RL and TL had gotten such amazing reviews, I assumed the CL had to be pretty great too.  Wrong.  The 1999 CL was a disappointment.  Little more than a price-inflated Accord.  

However, the 2001 model far surpasses my wildest expectations.  You can still tell itï¿½s a Honda at heart, but now the soul is all Acura.  And what soul it is!

I got home and could scarcely wait to go to the Acura dealer and check out the CL for myself.  I got behind the wheel and melted.  This car is fun, fast, powerful, beautiful, and definitely a steal at the current price tag.  I would whole-heartedly recommend the 2001 3.2 CL.  If it is in your price range and on your radar, it is worth more than passing glance!  Enjoy!<br><br>
