            I have had this camera for about a month.  It has been really easy to use, which is a good thing because the instruction manual is rather vague.  I have used it in many different lighting situations with good results.  Picture quality is good for the price. However it does drain batteries quickly, but then all digital cameras do. I found it at Wal-mart for $218.  I shopped around and this was the best buy available for pixels vs price.  It is a great first camera for anyone interested in getting into digital photography.  This camera has many features of the higher priced cameras including flash,view finder, LCD screen and an included a/c power adapter.  About the only thing this camera doesn't have is a zoom.  The software included is easy to use compared to some of the other digital camera software I have tried. I would highly recommend this camera to anyone wanting a digital camera at a low price.  <br><br>
