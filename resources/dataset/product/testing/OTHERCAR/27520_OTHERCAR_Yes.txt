            I call my Jeep my 4x4 Cadillac, because it has all the amenities, plus it gets me around with confidence when the snow is falling and the wind is blowing.  I have had my Jeep for 1 year and find it to be a very comfortable ride.  If you live where it is very cold, the heated seats are just wonderful.  The Limited version of the Grand Cherokee is the top of the line for this SUV and comes with almost everything you could want.
  
The best thing about this vehicle is that it rides beautifully.  Even on the country back roads that are like wash boards, it feels great.  It has a quiet sunroof, which is something I have not encountered before. It has plenty of hauling space, and cleans up very well, even after hauling around bales of hay for my dogs. The engine has plenty of power.  Mine has the 5.2 L engine, which is a revamped Chrysler 317 c.i. The interior is quite comfortable. The information system tells you quite a bit about your mileage, miles, temperature, and all the interesting stuff you want to know if you like your cars to be smart.  I really enjoy all the features on this truck.  Sometimes I forget it is a truck, until I need to haul 3 grand babies and all their stuff.

Even though I really like this vehicle, there are a couple things I think should change.  You can not get a locking gas door.  All the stuff it comes with, and they neglected to add this. Gas disappears out of tanks a lot around here, and my other car, a cheap one, has a button inside to open the fuel door, but not Jeep.  When I bought it, I looked it up, not available at this time. I had to buy a keyed gas cap.  I also am not always happy with the area between the front seats.  Stuff falls down in by the parking brake, and even though there are two cup holders, I am always looking for a place to put other stuff, like gloves, pens, etc.  I can't say anything very good about the gas mileage either.  I average about 16.8, and I live in the country so most of my miles are highway.  My last gripe, and this is the biggest, is that it is hot in the summer, and cold in the winter.  If you like automatic temperature controls on cars, don't use it in the winter, at least not when you warm it up.  It won't blow any air until the engine is completely warmed.  Your engine may be at 150 degrees, but you won't see any of it when set on automatic.  In this climate, that could be 15 miles down the road.  I've tested it.  I set the controls manually to overcome this.  Mine has brown leather seats, which are extremely hot in the summer.  My advice would be a light colored vehicle, mine is char-gold, and a light colored interior.

In all though, I do recommend this vehicle to people who want to feel secure, don't mind the gas mileage, enjoy the bells and whistles(At night it looks like an airplane cockpit), and want to feel above it all on the highway. When it is time to trade in, I will get another Grand Cherokee, and hopefully I will be able to get one I love as much as this one.   <br><br>
