            This Jeep is rock solid. From the simple, but very functional interior to it's ruggedly styled exterior. 2002 Grand Cherokee Laredo is build like a rock. So far it is surviving this years Chicago winter without any problems. The first thing out of most people mouths when they ride in it is 'it's really smooth'.  At first it took some getting used to the 'cushy' seats (having been driving a 2000 Chevy Tracker for awhile), but now I love them. The power is perfect for me. Nice smooth acceleration. Solid braking. Great view of the road. Fantastic heating and great A/C.  Ergonomically makes sense. I really do appreciate the huge knobs for the climate controls. Getting into the GC after being out in -20 degree weather I tend to leave the gloves on and the size of the knobs are a great help. Engine warms quickly in the cold weather. A little engine noise at speed, but liveable. The sound system good too. I didn't get the 'upgrade' to Infinity system, but the stock is more than adequate for my tastes. Great all-season A/T tires, but probably replace them with BFG's ( just a preference). The center console can hold just about a dozen CD's or more and the loose change holder is located there as well; it holds dimes, quarters and nickels. The cup holder is adequate, but had problems holding larger drinks such as a 'Big Gulp'. The steering wheel only is adjustable by tilt and not by telescoping, which would be a nice feature.  The cruise controls and radio controls (if equipped with that option) are located on the steering wheel. Big easy buttons for easy location and handling are much appreciated.  The windshield wiper(s) as well as turn signals and lights are operated by the standard two handles along both sides of the steering column. Nice and easy to read and understand. Ergonomically the Grand Cherokee Laredo is a well thought out. Using large knobs and handles for when the weather turns bad and one needs to wear gloves, all are appreciated.  Cargo room is a plenty here too.  Since the later models spare tire is located in the cargo area with it's own 'well' hidden underneth the floor, you might have to lift your equipment or groceries a little higher than normal. But this design not only is funtioncal but practical. Older models had the spare mounted on one side of the cargo area, reducing you view.  This also doesn't hamper the vehicles off-road capabilites either. Unlike most SUV's, where the spare is located directly underneth the vehicle, which could also increase the chance for theft and influence your off-roading adventures. 
The only real down side to the 2002 Grand Cherokee Laredo would be it's gas comsumtion. Mine has the standard inline six. granted you don't buy a SUV and expect super gas mileage. So far I have been getting milage that was printed on the sticker give or take. Driving on the expressways is smooth and sure. Driving in the city, you'll feel some bumps and the vehicle sometimes has some body roll from side to side depending on the size of the pothole you run over. That's probably due to the live axles. but that's just one of the things what sets Grand Cherokees apart from the rest. Built like a truck handles like one. No independant suspension here, this is a Jeep remember and not a sedan. Purpose built for going off-road, not neccesarliy taking the kids to soccer practice or the groceries. If you want a silky smooth ride get another so-called 'SUV' or a sedan. Overall the ride comfort will please most people with Grand Cherokees soft cushy seats. One of the more brilliant features on this SUV is the folding rear seats. It has the standard 60/40 split, but there's no need to remove the headrests. All you need to do is pull a little on this lever which is located just behind the headrest . The headrest folds into itself. The whole rear seating folds flat, providing you with acres of cargo room. There are also places throughout the rear cabin for tie-downs. The rear window flipper is great for just wanting to 'throw' something in the rear cargo area without having to open the whole tailgate which flip open vertically. The rear also has tinted window covering 3/4's of the SUV. The passengers and all the rear for privacy and protection from the sun. The rear is adequate for two adults or three children. There's an option for side curtain airbags as well. Overall I really enjoy my new 2002 Grand Cherokee Laredo.
