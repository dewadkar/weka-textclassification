READ THIS WARNING!!!      READ THIS WARNING!!!

Today, Jeep issued a recall involving ALL MODELS.

If you have a Jeep, and use it in snow country, you need to read on.

THIS IS A BRAKING ISSUE!!!

Road salt is known to corrode the brake rotors, causing the rotors to SHATTER without warning.

If you own or drive a jeep of any kind, CALL YOUR MECHANIC for details on this VERY SERIOUS ISSUE!!!

Jeep will replace the old style rotors with new STAINLESS STEEL rotors, at no cost to you.

Several million Jeep vehicles are affected by this problem.

Though my Jeep is old and tired, she still gets up every morning and takes me wherever I need to go. She works hard all day, and I wouldn't trade her for any other vehicle.

She will be going in for a new set of brakes very soon.
