            The 2000 Lincoln Navigator is a very powerful sport utility vehicle.  It gives you a lot of control over the road with its four wheel drive option.  This suv is a lot larger and roomier than most other sport utility vehicles out there.  The interior has lots of space so you can fit your whole family inside, or even a big group of your friends.  The shape of the 2000 Navigator is very sleek and sophisticated looking.  It has a futuristic look, which i really like.
The 2000 Lincoln Navigator is very easy to drive too.  I actually like driving the Navigator - it's very fun.  It has really good suspension and good handling.  It has a very powerful V8 engine for all you racers out there.  The Lincoln Navigator is a-ok.<br><br>
