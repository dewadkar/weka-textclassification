            Good easy to use point and shoot camera.

The resolution was fine to print a better than ok 8 x 10.  Much better than what is needed for web work.
  
It can be tethered to a computer and the images immediately stored into the hard drive.  Makes for easy table top work.

The software was easy to store pictures, but not to make any major adjutstments to the pictures.  If you use PhotoShop make adjustments there, if you want to take out the red eye, it's fine.

Over all great for table top web work, great for test shots for higher end cameras.
