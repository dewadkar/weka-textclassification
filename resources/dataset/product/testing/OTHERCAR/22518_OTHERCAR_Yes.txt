            I've owned and enjoyed my '98 Land Cruiser for nearly 2 years and almost 50,000 miles! What a vehicle! In my fickle past, I've been through 5 Scouts, 2 Jeeps, 2 Blazers, a Ramcharger, a Bronco, a Tahoe. The LC puts them all in the shade (of course, it cost at least as much as any two of the others!)
The interior is attractive, thoughtfully laid out and comfortable enough to drive forever. While I still prefer the exterior styling of the older (90-97) body, the V-8 in the current model more than makes up for the ho-hum styling. You can tow a good size boat all day and hardly realize its back there. THIS Cruiser can scoot! 
4X4 performance is entirely adequate for my purposes (minor rock climbing on hunting trips in central Texas and running down the beach).
I have experienced no mechanical problems in nearly 50,000 miles.
I love this truck! The only complaint I have is the cheapo tape pin stripes. They began to peel off within a couple of months of my purchase. Seems to me that a vehicle that costs almost as much as a house should come with painted pin stripes, however, this is a minor concern given the fantastic ride, comfort level, reliability and power in the new LC.
My other complaint is the price!! With that kind of investment, guess I'll have to keep this thing the rest of my life!! <br><br>
