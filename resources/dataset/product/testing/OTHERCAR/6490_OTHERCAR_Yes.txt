            I've been on the hunt for a good digital camera for the longest now, and I guess I've always been riding the fence even when fairly good deals came up in the past because I didn't know if I wanted a really good still camera or a mediocre video camera that had the capability to take still pictures.

The Kodak DX3600 seemed to be the best of both worlds, and the chase seems to have been worth it. I first saw the DX3600 at Wal-Mart, and the sales associate told me that he had almost reached the end of his inventory in about five days. Intrigued, I played with the display piece for a while, and came away very impressed with its abilities of capturing video and the time allowed for a video clip on the 8 MB onboard storage. The built-in 8 MB memory allowed for about 35 seconds of high-resolution video at a resolution of 320 x 240 - and since I had been toying around with VideoCDs for a while before, I recognized that resolution as one enough to use for making reasonably good VideoCD clips.

Toying with the idea of buying this one - I called the same Wal-Mart the next day to find that the camera was sold out, and it was sold out not only in this store, but also in three neighboring stores! I checked online, and none of the online stores had a price that would beat the Wal-Mart price of $199. Also, most online stores, including eBay, seemed to have either refurbished or used devices, and those weren't dipping lesser than $250.

Cutting a long story short, I ended up going to another Wal-Mart and getting their last piece for $199. For the last week, I've been putting it through its paces, and its fared very well. The video recording works very well, and I've been quite surprised to see that the time it allows for a video clip has actually increased for the last three times that I've let it roll till the end of the memory card. I got myself a 128 MB memory card - and the last video clip I recorded was a few seconds short of 11 minutes. In my opinion, that's quite impressive!

The digital still quality is very nice as well. I've not bought the EasyShare dock, but have preferred to hook up the USB cable to my computers as needed. I've also got myself a four-pack of rechargeable Panasonic batteries, and I think we're shipshape!

The 128 MB memory card allows for close to 200 high-resolution pictures, and for close to 11 minutes of high-resolution video (with audio). Data transfer using the bundled software is a breeze since it essentially lets the computer recognize the camera as a new drive when connected, and one can use the Explorer interface to drag and drop images and video clips from the memory card and/or on-board storage onto the hard disk.

From a fairly rudimentary comparison with a friend's DX3500 - one model lower - I found that battery life was almost equal, and from conversations with other digital camera users, I was left with the impression that battery life for the DX3600 was quite good. As mentioned earlier, I got the four-pack of rechargeable batteries (another $13), and went without the dock.
