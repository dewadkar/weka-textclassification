            <b>Summary:</b> You can really feel the road in a Chevy Cavalier - every dip, bump and speck of gravel.  If the ride's this rough in a 1-year-old car, how will it be doing in year 5?

<b>Relevant Personal Background</b>
After nine years with a 1991 Chevrolet Cavalier, my wife and I recently updated to a 2000 Honda.  After so many years with cramped space, a rough ride and various electrical problems, we were relieved to drive a comfortable, smooth-riding car that virtually hummed.  Then we got in an accident and had to part with our Honda for three weeks.  

During that time, we rented a 2000 Chevy Cavalier with just 5000 miles on it.  During those three weeks I came to appreciate my Honda more and more.  The rough ride, unresponsive engine and cramped space of the Cavalier give me little to recommend.

<b>Rough Ride</b>
In our rented Cavalier, we could feel every dip, bump and speck of gravel on the road -- the car seems to be designed not to dampen shocks, but rather to amplify them.  Acceleration and deceleration were accompanied by moderate vibrations in the body of the car.  The noises of these bumps and vibrations came through loud and clear into the passenger compartment.

<b>Unresponsive Engine</b>
The Cavalier is not a subtle car when it comes to speed.  This may have its charms for some, but I found it annoying that I had to stomp down on the accelerator every time I needed to speed up.  The Cavalier and the Accord each have just 4 cylinders, but somehow the Accord seems to be better able to make use of them.  I appreciate the ability to move quickly out of potentially dangerous situations on the road, and the Cavalier just doesn't measure up there.

<b>Cramped Seating</b>
Finally, I found the Cavalier to be cramped in its space.  I am not an oddly huge guy -- 6 feet tall, 175 pounds -- but I found myself feeling claustrophobic as I drove, with just enough head and leg room to get by but not enough to feel comfortable.

<b>What will Happen in the Dry?</b>
There's an old saying: &quot;if this is how it is in the greenwood, what will happen in the dry?&quot;  The saying implies that problems with things that are new are amplified when they get older.  I found myself wondering the same thing about the Cavalier.  If the car drives roughly in its first year, how will it feel by year 5?  If the engine isn't responsive now, how will it perform later on?  If I feel uncomfortable in the first week of driving a car, how will that feeling accumulate over the years?  Three weeks of driving this car was enough to make me feel incredibly lucky when my Honda got out of the shop and we could leave the Cavalier behind.  In short, my confidence in the Cavalier's short- and long-term performance is not high, and so I cannot recommend it to you.<br><br>
