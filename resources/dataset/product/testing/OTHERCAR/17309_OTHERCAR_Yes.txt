            About 10 years ago my grandmother gave me her old '79 Chevy Malibu.  I drove it around for several years and had a fine time with it.  No major problems at all.  But it was totally an old lady's car.

Not so the all new Malibu.

Fast forward to December of 2000.  My Saturn was totaled and it was time to buy a new car.  I was interested in something very reliable.  I'm not the type to care much about how the car looks, I want something practical.

I did my research.  The 2001 Malibu was rated 'highly recomended' by Consumer Reports.  And the Edmunds.com car web site also gave it rave reviews.

I have 2 young children and so I was interested in safety features and how convenient it is to get two kids in and out of the back seat.  There is a tether to attach car seats in a more secure way than in my old car.  The back seat is spacious enough to get three car seats in when a friend visits.  I like the layout of the controls, the dash mounted ignition is very handy.  The trunk is HUGE.

I got the base model,and the list of standard features on it is impressive.  I also got power windows and doors, cruise, floor mats, fold down rear seats, and a CD player... all for under 17,500.

This car is as big as the Camrys I've ridden in, and much cheaper.  A great value!
