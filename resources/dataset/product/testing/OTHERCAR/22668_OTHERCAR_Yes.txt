            In April of 1999, I bought my first car...a 1999 Silver Mist Pontiac Grand Am SE.  I absolutely love my car and would not trade it in for the world!!!!  I had saved up some money and had been shopping around town, but I just couldn't find anything that I really loved.  I wanted something reliable, and something sporty.  I wasn't looking for a brand new car, but the price was very affordable for what all I got....7-band equalizer, CD player, very comfortable seats, cruise control on the steering wheel, traction control system, running lamps, automatic light turn-on, etc.  The middle panel, where the radio and all of the heat settings are, are tilted in towards the driver's seat, so it's easier to access as you're driving down the road.  

After a few weeks of having owned the car, I noticed a large scratch on my two back windows after having rolled them up and down a few times.  I took my car to my dealer, and they told me that this was a common problem among the new Grand Am's and so they fixed my windows.  

My car handles wonderfully with Michigan's snow and ice.  Only recently did I have a problem with my traction system.  A ball bearing had to be replaced, and then the problem was fixed.  Besides these two slight problems, I've had nothing but great luck with my car.  

I love all of the warning lights within my instrument panel.  It lets me know when my oil is low, engine needs to be serviced, oil needs to be changed,  tire pressure is low, among many other things.  The Grand Am is very sporty looking and has great speed and pick-up with it's V-6 under the hood!  I get about 20-22 mpg while driving in the city and about 25-26 mpg while highway driving.  Not bad I must say :)  The dual airbags, which are the next-generation airbags-meaning they come out a little slower and are safer, are a very nice safety feature.  Another nice safety feature is the adjustable shoulder restraints in the front.  They are adjustable for each person's height!!!  Also, the back seat folds down, so you can transport big items in your trunk. This car has proven to be very reliable to me, and I absolutely love it.  As I said before, I would not trade it for anything in the world!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>
