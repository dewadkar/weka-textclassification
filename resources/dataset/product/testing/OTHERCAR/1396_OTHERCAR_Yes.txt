            The Mercury Sable is possibly the best station wagon on the market. It's perfect for families, people who travel a lot, people who want to carry lots of cargo but still have a nice car. It's got the cargo space of a van with the looks and feel of a passenger car.

With the basic mechanical parts, everything is great. The Ford engine is built so that even the most unskilled mechanic can work on it, fix it, and not mess it up. It has a quality unsurpassed by other American car manufacturers. The ABS is four wheel in the post-1999 models, which along with the standard security system can give you lower insurance premiums. Increased safety is the key.

The interior of the car is the best thing. Leather trim seats add the glamour of leather without the non-stick pan feeling. The contrast of leather and cloth is part of what makes this car so attractive. The dashboard is well designed, with no cheap parts here. Don't expect that knob to break off six months later. Every little piece is made with good plastic. The car also has a wonderful spacious feeling that similar cars like the Focus and Volvo don't have. Legroom is ample and so is headroom. The arched ceiling makes you feel like you're in a living room on the road.

The cargo area is also a real treat. The rear-facing seat is great for large families or families who do a lot of carpooling. It adds a space for one or two extra children. The backseats also fold down, which almost doubles the cargo space and still leaves the front seats comfortable, not pushed up against the dashboard. The cargo door attractively glides open with the power of air pistons, and the rear winshield wiper is good for rainy days or dewy mornings.

Beginning in 1999 and completed in the 2000 models, the Sable was redesigned. The fish-eye look that began in the 1996 models was changed to the more modern looks of the Focus and Echo. The headlights and windows were redesigned, making this car a very handsome one. It's a look you'll be happy to see every time you walk up to it and one that certainly helps its resale value.

The Sable is the perfect car for anyone who needs lots of space but not the boxy exterior. If you're deciding whether or not to buy this car, stop hesitating and run out to the dealership now. I spent several months fretting over which car to buy, and I was greatly relieved when I finally decided to buy it. It's been six months, and I have no regrets. Mercury/Ford also offers regular sales, rebates, and special APR that push this car into the extremely affordable range. I am completely satisfied by the Sable and you will be, too.
