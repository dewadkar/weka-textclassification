            I've owned plenty of cars in my day; German, Japanese, and American.  I bought my first Honda Civic when they first came over and were extremely small.  But, that little car had more personality and ran better than any car I've ever owned, and I had my fill of American cars constantly needing repairs.  I thought about going German again having owned BMW and VW, but the purchase price was high and that costly maintenance factor reared its ugly head again.
I have NEVER had a repair problem with Honda and have bought my three latest cars without test driving them, the reputation speaks for itself.  Read my review on Honda mowers.  I own Honda mowers, a Honda Odyssey van for my wife and 8 month old son, and recently traded in my 1998 Civic EX for a new 2001 model.
I'm in sales so I do a lot of driving and need an economic, dependable car, plain & simple.  At 38 MPG highway, the Honda Civic EX is that car.  Less OUCH! at the pump!
The more I drive it, the more I like it.  Roomy, comfortable, and a great CD & cassette player for my sales training tapes.  Reasonably quiet cabin, great gas mileage, and some zip down the highway!
