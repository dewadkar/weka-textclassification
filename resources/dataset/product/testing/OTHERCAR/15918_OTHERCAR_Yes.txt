            A friend and co-worker just bought a new Mercury Sable because of a unique feature. She is shorter than five feet and always has to sit closer to the steering column than is recommended for cars with airbags.
This Mercury Sable is available with pedals - break, accelerator which move forward with the push of a button on the side of the driver's seat.

She loves being able to sit back comfortably and being able to reach the pedals instead of driving with her toes.

The cost of her car was $28,000, but it also has power seats, great stereo, bucket seats, and probably other features she has mentioned to me yet.

Obviously, this is not a thorough review of the Mercury Sable, but I felt people need to know about the availability, at least on this car, of the pedals that can be moved forward. We short people have to stick together!<br><br>
