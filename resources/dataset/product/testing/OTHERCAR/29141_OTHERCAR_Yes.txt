            I aspire to this vehicle.  I test drove it the other day, preparing for what's next in the family vehicle category.

I drove the V70 XC (R I think).

Holy Smokes! Talk about everything you could want in a car. Fast Fast Fast! off the line accelleration like you could not believe... in a wagon no less. I drove a rare five speed... and the whole car moved forward like it had rockets attached.  Compared to the 850 turbo, which would light up the front wheels and chirp into second and third, the four wheel drive system in the xc never let that happen. 

Combine a remarkable safety record with super handleing, superior performance, and stealthy good looks, the Volvo XC is my dream car. I will buy one soon... will you?<br><br>
