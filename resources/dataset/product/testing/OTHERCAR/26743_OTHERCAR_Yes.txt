            I use the Sony Mavicas at my school and I love 'em... but the Olympus Camedia D-360L swept me off my love for Mavicas.  The Olympus has 2 flaws, only 2X Zoom and not that many effects on the camera itself.  But those aren't important if you got a killer editor like Adobe Photoshop.  The Olympus D-360L has amazing quality at even 640X480.  It's Paronama mode can be a little tricky to get just perfect- but when done correctly will awe even the most skeptical of users.  1.3 Megapixels might not seem enough to some users (there's 3.3 now) but 1.3 will print out a 5X7&quot; photo.  The crisp detail and excellent JPEG Compression makes this camera a Godsend.  Don't let the inexpensive price ($300) decieve you.  I've used cameras twice the price that don't have such great JPEG and TIFF photo turnout.  

Olympus is very smart.  To get a camera such as this under $400, the company has to give up something.  Olympus was very smart to diminish to only a 2X Zoom and not quality.

The Flash on this camera is awesome.  It will light up almost a typical size room with very little glare!!!



Another thing this camera has that some other's dont.

#1- Takes Alkalines, Lithiums, and rechargeables (Ni-cad, and NIMH).  
#2- It doesn't drain them so much as other cameras, even while using LCD and Flash.

The Olympus TV Out is a wonderful feature that I wish was a standard on all cameras.  But unlike others, this camera doesn't give any reception likes/&quot;frame&quot; lines around the picture.

The Camedia Master Software isn't the best in the world.  (Only good for touching up minor details); although the Autofix feature is nice.

Team this camera up with Paintshop Pro or Adobe Photoshop 5.5; they belong together.

I will be using THIS Olympus for a looong time!
