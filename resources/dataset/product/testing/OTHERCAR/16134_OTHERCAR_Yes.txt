            When my wife and I were looking to buy a new car, we test drove many.  We needed to have four wheel drive because we live on a mountain and without it is impossible to get up our driveway in the winter.  We looked at various Subarus, Jeeps, and SUV's from Mercedes, Lexus, Cadillac, etc.  We even looked at an Audi TT Quattro just for fun :).  But after all was said and done, it was easy to see which one was for us.

The 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee is quite possibly the best SUV of all.  Ours we had equipped with the Quadra-Drive system, and that proved to be a godsend.  No more getting stuck, under any condition.  We also had a trailer hitch on it, and the only thing different about the ride when we go camping is the acceleration.  It is the most comfortable vehicle I have ever driven.  One thing though, if you get one of these, don't get one with leather seats unless you really have your heart set on them.  They are not comfortable at all.  It is seriously like sitting on a board.  With the cloth seats, this car is amazing.  It handles beautifully, and it seemed like it was floating the ride was so soft.  Excellent.

The only bad thing about this car (other than the leather, of course) was that on ours we were going to try to save a little money on gas and get the V6.  Do not do this.  The gas miliage was exactly the same as with the V8 and it has substantially less power.  If you are looking into this car, make sure yours has a V8, I guarantee you will thank yourself later.  

Overall, great job Jeep.  Keep up the good work!<br><br>
