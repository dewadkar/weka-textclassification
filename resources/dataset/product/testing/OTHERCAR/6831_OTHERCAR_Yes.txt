            I bought a '95 Subaru Legacy back in '94 and owned it for over 5 years. I have recently traded it in for a Lexus RX300.

The Subaru is a nice handling car (for a station wagon) with adequate power (but not overwhelming). The seating position is quite low (like most cars). There is plenty of storage space in the wagon, which is the major reason I bought one - to haul my windsurfing gear. It also handles snow very well (though I still used chains) in lake Tahoe and Portland because 4WD and AWD do not help in stopping.

The ride is firm but a little too noisy for my taste. It's fine as long as the music is loud enough.

As far as conveniences go, the stereo is adequate but the speakers are not very good. All the other standard amenities are there.

As far as problems over the 5 year history: nothing major (I was still on the original brakes, battery, muffler, and timing belt) after 85,000 miles. The minor things that were annoying included: engine light coming on once, 2-3 recalls.

Subarus flat 4 engines used to have a problem with oil leaks and I don't know if this has been solved. I know that my Legacy started to develop an oil smell after 80,000 miles and I couldn't figure it out.

My experience will Subaru dealers is tha there are some good and some bad ones. The major problem is getting parts, and if you don't have a Subaru dealer close by, this could be a problem. Subaru is fairly popular in Oregon but not in California. Many auto shops in California will NOT work on Subarus (a surprise to me). Also, Subarus tend to depreciate much faster then the Hondas/Toyotas.

Overall, the Legacy has been a nice car.
