            The Honda Accord is common place now. You see them as often as you see Geo Metros. Once an economy car the Accord has gone through a conversion, to become a luxury car.

The interior is up to Honda's strict quality standards. The plastics are well fitted and look as though they belong. The steering wheel contains the cruise control controls, which aids in ease of use. The stereo seems to be in the wrong place though, and there is not automatic climate control optional. This is one of the worst sounding stereos I have ever heard in a car + $20,000.

Honda's V6 engine is one of the most efficient, and smooth engines I have felt in this class. The transmission handles the engine well, as though they were a team. A 5 speed auto would be a welcomed addition, even if optional.

Exterior styling reflects that of a BMW 7. Nice lines from the hood to the back compliment wide door openings and decent ground clearance. Wheels are a must to &quot;finish&quot; the look of this automobile.
