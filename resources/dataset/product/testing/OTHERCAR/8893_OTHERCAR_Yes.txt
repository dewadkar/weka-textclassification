            After Driving a 1998 GSX Turbo, it was clear that I was converted.  I always thought the 2nd genration DSM (mitsubishi Eclipse/Eagle Talon) non-turbo was always a nice little car. It had good handling, a nice body, and a hatchback body going for it.  But after experiencing AWD and turbo at its best in this little car, I was done with the non-turbos.

This thing is clearly the Mitsubishi 3000GT VR4's little brother.  It may not have the crazy techno-gizmos or the all out horsepower, but what the eclipse GSX has over its bigger brother is potential.

Sure, the VR4 is a twin turbo missile and has been known to post some serious numbers with little modification, but the eclipse GSX has atleast 650 pounds less mass than the porkier VR4.  The Eclipse turbo also has a bigger aftermarket parts bin than the much less popular VR4.  

The aftermarket is unlimited for the GSX.  Things ranging from turbo specific intakes to HUGE turbos and intercoolers transforms the little eclipse GSX from a quick, capable sporty car to an all out road rocket with incredible handling, and it can all be done reliabiltiy with the right installation.

The stock GSX drives beautifully.  It has great traction for wet roads due to the all wheel drive system, great, firmly controlled suspension, and street scorching power from the little 4G63 Turbo 4 cylender. The five speed transmission gets the power to the ground effectively so and shifts smoothly.  It would shift even better with a short shifter kit.

So while it would be OK to get a non-turbo for a SHOW ride, the real cheese is with the turbo.  And if you cna find one, it's wise to get the All wheel drive GSX model instead of the regular GST front drive model, unless you can cope with the torque steer to the front wheels.
