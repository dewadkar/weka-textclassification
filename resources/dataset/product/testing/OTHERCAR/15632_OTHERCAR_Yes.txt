            The Sony FD-91 is a great digital camera.  It has it all, including the basic drawbacks of other digital camera's like being slow for second and third shots in a series but for just plain good pictures it is very hard to beat.  I used the camera and the first time it was borrowed so I had no instruction book but despite that it was really easy to set up and operate.  It is also a no brainer to get your pictures from the camera to the computer screen.  The three and a half floppy disk is the easiest of any digital camera that I have ever seen (excluding others that use the same system) and gives you the option of having almost unlimited pictures by carrying a few extra disks.
Bad points are that it is fairly heavy and somewhat bulky compared to some others and it is slow for sequence shots.  Cost is high, around a grand which is plenty for a camera..
Good points..High resolution, nearly as good as a regular 35mm camera and ease of use.  Film (disks) are cheap and plentiful.  (reformat a few old free aol disks)<br><br>
