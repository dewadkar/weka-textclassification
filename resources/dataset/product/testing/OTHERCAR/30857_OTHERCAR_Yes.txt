            After I heard about the Suzuki Grand Vitara being the most wanted SUV I decided to take a closer look.  While I admit that it is a good looking vehicle, I was originally interested in the KIA.  I had heard a few things about the KIA though, and was &quot;investigating&quot; the situation when I ran across information the the Vitara.  

WOW!!  All I can say is &quot;Holy Macaroni!&quot;  I fell in love right away with the interior and exterior of what I like to call &quot;Suzuki's Surprise.&quot;  I haven't been real impressed with Suzuki's in the past.  Forgive me, but my belief has been that the automobiles they produced were &quot;shotty&quot;, cheap and plastic.  While that may not be true, it was just what I had always envisioned their craftsman ship as being.  

The Grand Vitara 2000 is loaded with features including, but not limited to rear defrost and wipers, easy 4wd conversion, fold down seats, pollen filtration air, power windows, power locks, &amp; alloy wheels (if you purchase this package).  I love it!

The Vitara is a great ride.  It's very quiet compared to SUV's in it's class.  In fact, a friend of mine told me that they were rated quietest among the compact SUV's.  There is plenty of legroom, as well as headroom. The seats offer headrests, which is a nice feature.  The interior is really classy for the price.  It's not real plush, but it's comfortable and respectably made.  It is also equipped with dual air bags.  You can switch to 4WD very easily, even during highway driving.  I love the fact that the back seats fold down all the way, providing more space if you're going shopping or going on a trip. As well, the Vitara provides lots of nice places for storage like in the door and under the seat cubbies. 

Gas prices are up right now, and I know that weighs heavily upon those considering the purchase of an SUV.  Let's face it, SUV's are known generally for being gas guzzling hogs.  The Vitara is supposed to be capable of 21mpg on the highway and 19 in the city.  I've heard of various ranges from different owners but are withing about 2mpg of the claim.  

All in all, I'd have to say the Vitara is a classy looking sport utility with a wide range of features (outdoing that of KIA, in my opinion)and buyer options.  I just hope that the gas prices don't go much higher right now.  :o)
