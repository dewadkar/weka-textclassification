            I purchased the 2002 RSX Premium with manual 5 speed in September. Below is my impression of the care after 4 months of ownership.

First I need to explain the reason I picked the RSX premium over other cars in the market. After driving my old Honda Civic for 8 years, it is about time to get a new car even though it is still running fine. I want a car that is reliable, fast, handles great, looks good, not very expensive and has good fuel economy for daily use. The RSX really provides a good balance of everything I look for.

Handling of the RSX is precise and solid. It gives me the confidence to go fast approaching a curve and know that it will not disappoint. Even though the RSX doesn't have front and rear double wish bone suspension like my old Civic, but it sure gets around corners with ease. Stock tires are just fine. If you upgrade them the RSX will just glue to the road.

Fuel economy is quite good. With conservative driving I am consistently getting 27 mpg. Only regular gas is required according to the owner's manual. Type S requires premium gas however.

Interior finish is high quality and the fake leather bucket seats are comfortable and keep you in place while cornering.

Ride is hard however. You'll feel every bumps on the road. If you can't stand it, get another car. I don't like it but it is barely acceptable. It is the price to pay for the handling so I won't complain. Type S is even worse.

The one thing I dislike most about the RSX is the rear visibility. The C pillar is so thick, you can't see much with the rear mirror. The windows between the B and C pillar are small too. Check your blind spot carefully.

Acceleration is good with just the driver. More load / passenger will slow down the car dramatically. After all, the car has only peak hp of 160 and I rarely drive my RSX at high rev.
