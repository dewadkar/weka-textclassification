            I purchased this truck in July of this year.  Primary reason for the purchase is to tow a 2.5-ton boat between Atlanta and Asheville, North Carolina.  I bought the larger V-8.  This is an excellent truck with plenty of power for the mountains or piedmont areas.  Braking in the mountains with a 2.5-ton boat in tow gives you plenty of confidence in this trucks ability.  The extended cab is roomy and the back seat very comfortable for long or short rides.  Front seats are leather and heated a great plus on cold mornings.  Gas mileage is not the best, but I bought the truck for its power and towing ability.  I highly recommend this truck.<br><br>
