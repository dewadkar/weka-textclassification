            I just purchased a new 2000 Land Cruiser (del'd to me Dec. 17th) and I feel like I have came home!!!  I had a new 1993 model that was totaled almost a year to the day - and which I credit with saving my life !  So did the police that came to the scene. Not a shred of glass was left in the vehicle anywhere, I was still buckled in (though upside down) and not a scratch anywhere!
I was so attached to the LC that I figured I couldn't replace it with another one (it just wouldn't be the same). So I decided to try a different Utility vehicle and even though the one I tried was luxurious and big...it just didn't meet the Toyota LC standards in my book.  I suffered through for two years and then succumbed to the temptation.  I ordered my LC and as the fairy tales go - am living happily ever after !

The added power in the V8 is astonishing; the new brake system is a major plus, and I was able to experience the precision in this winter's serious snow and icy roads !
When I am behind the wheel I not only feel safe because of the quality of the vehicle, but being able to see so clearly is a big plus too.

As for what I hate about my LC.....I can't think of a thing !  Now that there is V8 that solved the only previous issue I had - not enough pick up power.

I am a 49 Yr. old female that absolutely loves her &quot;buggy&quot;...all of my teenagers friends love it too.  I think there is not an or gender that would not love it if they want Room for comfort while riding up to 8; a safe secure ride with excellent handling; and a really good looking vehicle thrown in !<br><br>
