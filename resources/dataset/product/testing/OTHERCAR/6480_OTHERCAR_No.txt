            I was in the market for the proverbial "hot hatch" and the Mercedes C230k seemed like it was a good candidate. It is on the very high end of a group of cars I was looking at - Mini Cooper S,  VW GTI  1.8t and the Matrix XRS. I would have loved to try the Lexus IS300 Sportcross, but I just didn't want to cross that 30K threshold.

Now the Mercedes for around 27000....I thought I could swing that.

During the test drive I found this car felt great to drive - solid, safe, quick and very smooth. It had a nice, tight 6 speed hooked up to a what felt like a great supercharged four. 

The panoramic sunroof is great, the car handles well and did I mention I liked the shifting? Snappy, short throws, very nice.

8 airbags, standard electronic stabilization, maintenance included. It just felt a step up from the other cars I was looking at, which you'd expect given the extra 5-10K.

So, I could afford this car, Iiked  driving the car, so why didn't I buy it?

Though I appreciate Mercedes' effort to sell cars to the hipper, younger and less loaded demographic, they have a lot to learn.

First, the cloth upholstery pattern is disgusting. Who picked that? Is that considered cool in Europe? You would think a luxury brand like Mercedes could put a little more effort into picking something that doesn't look so busy and unattractive.

Why no CD player? You would think that for thousands more than comparable sport hatches, you might get a  simple CD player without having to pay more.

The sound system was lousy. Thin, tinny sound that seemed to come out from under the glove box.  Again, should not be a problem with a car sold at this price point.

Worst of all was my experience at the dealer. I walked inside the showroom and cruised around. Nobody approached me, which at first was kind of refreshing. Then I waited, and waited ........and finally realized I was basically being ignored. Ok, I'm 29 and was wearing jeans, Tevas, a little unshaven, but I like to think I looked kinda good in one of my favorite hipster shirts. In fact I like to think I looked MUCH LIKE THE GUY IN THEIR C230k COMMERCIAL. But I guess the salespeople didn't smell someone who was ready to drop 6 figures on an S-class, so I had to go to the receptionist and ask for someone, even though I was the only customer at 9:30 in the morning and salespeople were everywhere.

So a guy comes up and is nice enough. He needs some time to find one of the only C230ks they have (they had to retrieve it off a rooftop) and we go for a spin.
I then ask him if I could borrow the car for a few hours so I could take it home and show my wife. Since she's home with two kids, it's the easiest way for us to carshop.

He reluctantly agrees, but acts really weary and is pretty unenthusiastic about it. He then says "promise you'll bring it back". Whatever, dude. My wife and I bought an Audi Allroad last year, and our Audi dealer practically forced us to take it for the weekend. But I guess at venerable Mercedes they aren't used to us crazy twenty-somethings. Maybe he had visions of me pulling a Ferris Bueller and racking up 300 miles on it.

His heart just didn't seem that into selling the car and he sure was patronizing. I guess its hard to be motivated to sell a car for 27k when you routinely double and triple that. But you know, if Mercedes wants to attract buyers like myself, they should make more of an effort to make us feel wanted, rather than as if it were our privilege to finally buy one of their cars.

So, already feeling a bit uncomfortable with the bling-bling status of the Mercedes brand, I said screw this and bought my VW GTI the next day. Well made, faster, just as safe, and loaded with stuff, like a cd-player. For about 7 thousand less.
