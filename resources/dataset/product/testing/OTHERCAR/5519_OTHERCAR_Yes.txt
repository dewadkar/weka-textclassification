            I purchased this camera specifically because I wanted a digital camera that I could carry anywhere without thinking about lugging a lot of equipment. Suffice it to say, I am very pleased with this product. It is VERY portable and will fit almost anywhere. It is not a bother to use and it opens up great conversations to boot. I've had lots of people comment on it and it's fun having them take a look at it and try it out. Plus, it's kind of funny hearing, "Oh, it's so SMALL!"

Ahem.

Anyway, cons with the camera begin with the less than admirable nighttime shots. I've taken pictures of this indoors and out in low light and unless your subject is really close, it won't show up too clearly or be very well lit. There is a low light/night shot setting that requires the user to hold the camera really still else you'll end up with blurry pics. But so long as your friends or family or whoever you're taking pictures of stay within 6 feet or so, it should be okay.

The neck lanyard that comes with the kit is okay, but it does make the camera bang around when you're bending over to pick stuff up from your car, trunk, etc.

The battery charger is ridiculous. It takes 13 hours to charge the two included AAA batteries. Once they charge they last a fairly long time, just make sure that you don't accidentally open the lens in your pocket and drain the battery. Do yourself the favor and pick up the $20+ quick charging kit including an extra set of batteries. It's more money for Conglom-O Sony, but it's worth it.

Oh, and the image compression is a little too high. It would have been great for Sony to have provided an option to adjust the image quality, but they didn't, and you're stuck with one quality setting for 640x480. It's okay, I guess, but it would have made this camera rock more had they included it.

Overall, I still highly recommend this camera. It's great for taking everyday shots and for e-mailing pics to your friends and family. If you can get a 128mb Memory Stick to supplant the included 8mb Stick, you can take high res pics all day long. In good light the pictures are excellent.
