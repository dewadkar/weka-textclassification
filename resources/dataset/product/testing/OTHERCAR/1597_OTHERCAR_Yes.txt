            I bought my first Prizm in '95 when they were still Geos. It later became my husband's commuter car for work. Both he and I thought it was great. It got very good mileage and never gave us any major problems in the 5 years we had it (we averaged about 15,000 miles a year, I bought it new). The only two problems we ever experienced was with one of the air vents and a plastic shield in front of the driver's side front tire. From the beginning, one of the front air vents would tilt down if the A/C was on. This eventually fixed itself. I could have had it fixed under warranty but it wasn't ever that big of a problem. The second problem involved the plastic shield in front of the tire that would sporadically &quot;pop out&quot; of place while driving above 55 mph. It would make this loud scratching noise so we'd pull over and &quot;pop&quot; it back in. We never got it fixed for the same reason - it didn't occur often enough.

About a month or so ago, we sold our Geo because we wanted to buy a new Prizm (not because anything was wrong with the old one). We had a considerable amount of GM dollars that were going to expire, an eager buyer for our car (after just mentioning once that we were thinking of selling our car), and over $2K in rebates. We couldn't pass up the new Chevy Prizm. My husband wanted a car with good gas mileage (he's been getting 40 miles per fill-up, and that's all city driving!). Also, it has a lot of features that you can't find with other cars in its class. We got an LSI and love it. It rides like a Honda Accord. We also got the child integrated seat and I wish we had done that with our other new car. (The only drawback we've found with this seat, though, is that our toddler doesn't find it comfortable for long road trips. So, we have to put his normal car seat in the car instead.) If you decide to not purchase the integrated car seat, there are tether strap hooks for all 3 seats in the back. I especially liked the new safety features. We have front and side air bags, head restraints and 3 shoulder belts in the back.

Some people might say, &quot;Why didn't you get an Accord?&quot; (or similar car)? We could've afforded it but our question is, &quot;Why NOT get the Prizm?&quot;. We have one child and another one the way so the limited room in the back won't be an issue for several years. My husband and I are on the taller size (6'1&quot; and 5'8&quot;) and there's plenty of head, shoulder, and leg room in the front while still allowing enough room for our small children in the back. We're planning on taking it, instead of our SUV, on a long road trip because it's comfortable and you can't beat the gas mileage. We're really glad we bought it (though I do miss my Geo, but the family who bought it LOVES it).<br><br>
