            I don't think anyone would buy a Malibu to experience any extremes.  I think the Malibu fits a slot that buyers would expect it to be adequate, basic transportation.  On that point, it delivers in most areas.

Things I liked
As with most GM vehicles these days, it's main strength is in it's powertrain.  The engine is nicely sized for daily duty, striking a balance between power and fuel economy.   The transmission always shifted smoothly and unobtrousively.  Overall the car felt solid and well built.  The outside mirrors are on the bigger side.  I liked them as it made backing into parking spots very easy.  Blind spots are minimal.

Things I didn't like
Tops on my list of dislikes are the seats.  Granted, I had a base model without power seats (maybe the upper level cars are better in this respect) but they were some of the most uncomfortable I've sat in.  Within 20 minutes of my trip, I was starting to squirm.  After a six hour round trip, I had a backache that lasted until the next day.  Truly punishing.  The brakes weren't the best either.  Although I never found myself running out of stopping room, they had a numb, hard feel that didn't inspire any confidence.  They also pulsated when stopping lightly.  Not good for a car with under 15,000 miles.  Also, the center vents are a crazy design.  The lowest they can go is about head level (they are tilted back in the dash, so they can't cool your torso or lap).  Overall they left my head cold and my torso hot.  The side vents are up by the side windows, so they aren't much help either.  The stereo is another of those adequate items in the Malibu.  If you like listening to soft music or news, the AM/FM single disc CD player should do fine.  If you want to push things, you can have volume or bass but not both.  I'm not talking about hear-you-coming-two-blocks-away bass either.  If you use any of the preset tone controls or manually push the bass much over half, it overpowers the rear speakers at an amazingly low volume.  Again, higher-line optional stereos are probably better.  The door locks are another annoyance.  They automatically lock (which I don't necessarily mind) but most of the time, they didn't unlock automatically when the car is turned off.  Worse yet, they don't automatically unlock when you open the door either.  I found myself having to manually unlock the doors each time I had to get out.  This may have been a defect as the locks didn't always behave in the same way.  Lastly, a little nit-pick: the steering wheel is too thin.  Even a slightly thicker rim would have improved the feel in my opinion.

Things to check out in a test drive
Center vent positioning
Radio performance
Seat comfort (try for an extended test drive or rent one for a day to get a good gage of extended comfort)
