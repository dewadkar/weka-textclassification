            I had a target in mind of $30K for a new car when I visited the local auto show. I was looking for a "sports sedan", if you will. My short list was the Mercedes C-Class, BMW 3-Series, Acura TL, Nissan Maxima, and VW Passat.

I was intrigued by the 255-260hp engines that came standard in the Maxima and Acura. In the $30K price range, the Mercedes and BMW offered engines around 70hp less. To even get in the same league, you had to upgrade to their bigger engines which pushed their prices up to $40K or above. Also, the C-class was getting scathing reviews about lack of quality controls. I shortened my list down to the Acura and the Maxima. The Acura reminded me too much of the Honda Accord we had, albeit nicer, but I ruled it out. I pretty much settled on a loaded Maxima GLE, which would have a sticker price just under $30K. I knew they were dealing on the Maximas, plus they had a $1000 rebate.

I was not even really considering the I-35 until I ran into a coworker that has a 2001 I-30. She told me that if I was looking at a loaded Maxima, the I-35 was not much more expensive and carried a couple of key advantages: a factory warranty of 4yrs/60K miles, free service loaner, and 4yr/unlimited mileage roadside assistance. She also spoke very highly of the "ownership experience" of Infiniti versus other brands of cars.

Off we went to the local Infiniti dealer. From the get-go, we were treated like royalty. I also had become interested in the new Infiniti G-35, so we told the salesman that we wanted to compare both cars. The salesman spent over 2 hours with us, letting both of us thoroughly test drive both of them and showing us the features of one versus the other (I'll review the G-35 separately). At all times he was competent, courteous, and obviously knew his products. This was in sharp contrast to the bum's rush we received when buying a new Toyota, which actually cost more than the I-35.

The I-35 has handsome styling, better than the Maxima, especially in the back. I still cannot get used to the bugeye tailights on the Maxima. There is plenty of interior room, especially in the back when compared to the BMW and Mercedes, which are very cramped. Creature comforts are everywhere-- woodgrain console and steering wheel, power seats on both sides, sumptuous leather, and a 200 watt Bose sound system with indash 6 CD changer. The only option on our car is the moonroof/rear sunshade package. The sunshade rises out of the rear package shelf with the push of a button and is supposed to keep the interior cooler (10 degrees according to the salesman) when the car is parked in the sun. Personally, I find it gimmicky and of little value, unless I can find a way to attach messages to display to drivers behind me, such as "GET OFF MY TAIL"... ;)

On the road, the I-35 is smooth and powerful with 255hp under the hood. The ride is comfortable but on the firm side. There is a Sport Package available with stiffer springs; I did not drive one as the standard suspension was firm enough and I have read that Maximas with the SE package ride too hard.

At highway speeds, I am somewhat disappointed in the interior noise level. It is not loud by any means, but there is more wind noise than you would expect in a car like this. Also, for 2002, the I-35 was given 17" wheels on all models. The tires are 55-series Bridgestones with a pretty aggressive tread pattern. The tires generate a great amount of road noise and this is what really adds to the cabin noise level. Perhaps a change of tires would help, but I don't want to invest in that right now. 

The standard Bose 200 watt sound system, with 6 CD changer in-dash (unless you order the NAV system, then it is moved to the trunk), cassette, and a subwoofer, sounds great. The louder you crank it, the better it sounds. The radio, trip computer, and cruise control buttons are mounted on the wood trimmed steering wheel. The radio volume control buttons are very small, however, curious when you would suspect that the driver would use these the most.

The I-35 also has side airbags standard as well as active head restraints for safety. Other nice standard features, such as Xenon headlights, one-touch up/down front windows, and dual power seats, give the I-35 a true luxury feel, and put it well ahead of BMW and Mercedes for value. The only main option you can add besides the moonroof package is the navigation system.

The I-35, with it's longer warranty, service loaner, and roadside assistance merit serious consideration if you are looking at a loaded Maxima GLE or just want a powerful, luxurious car for under $30K. Also, you will find that the dealership experience probably the best you have ever received if you are used to the treatment you get at most other dealers. When compared to a similarly equipped Maxima, the price difference is only about $1500 to $2000.

At the time of this review, Nissan is offering Maximas locally at invoice minus a $1000 rebate. This equates to roughly $4000 off list, not a shabby deal. Infiniti is basically offering the same deal on the I-35, although the $1000 is a "dealer incentive" and not widely advertised. With some negotiating, you should be able to get the I-35 for close to $4000 off sticker too--- which puts the car right up there with the best values of 2002.
