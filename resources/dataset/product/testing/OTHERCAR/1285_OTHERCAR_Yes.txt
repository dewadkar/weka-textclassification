            I'm writing this from the point of a Mac user (which I am), so I don't know if it's the same for a Windows user....

It's SO easy:
1) Point, zoom in/out, and click.
2) Repeat until you've filled up the memory or taken all the pictures you want.
3) install the software
4) plug the camera into your USB port and <b>BAM!</b> it shows up on your desktop
5) play with the pictures

So easy, it's scary! It reminds me a bit of the Apple QuickTake cameras in it's ease of use, but it's got the Nikon name, so you know it's good!

Photo quality is excellent at even the low resolutions, and the Macro mode is easy to get into, out of and use. The manual is a nice addition, but hardly neccessary.

Over all, 2 thumbs way up!
