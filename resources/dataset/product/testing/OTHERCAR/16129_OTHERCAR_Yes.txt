            This is definatly the most luxurious and comfertable SUV in it's price range.  The seats are way improved from past models and they took that pesky tire out of the back and hid it under the car.  It is a smooth quite ride.  The sound system is also great.  It has good base and surround soud.  
    It is also extremely reliable.  They outdid themselves this time.  Very easy to obtain the standard FULL SIZE SPARE from under the car. The electrical system is ver reliable as well.   It never fails to tell you when the washer fluid is low or the door is open.
    All around a durrable luxurious car!!<br><br>
