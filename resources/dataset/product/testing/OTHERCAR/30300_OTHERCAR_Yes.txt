            2 of my friends have purchased these in the last week. One got the Z-71 and the other one got The North Face special edition. I would never have personally given these trucks a second look until I saw them up close. I used to think they were ugly, but I have to say the look grows on you. The plastic around the bottom edge of the vehicle has its good and bad points. It wont rust or scratch as easy as paint will but it looks a bit cheap and there is no buffing a scratch out of plastic if you were to get one. 
  I will be the first to admit I am bias from the get go. I Hate Chevys. But I have to tell you, as much as I hate Chevys I really do like this truck over all.  Most of my dislike for the brand is from other peoples experiences. This thing really strikes me as a nice running, very useful, utility vehicle.   The only problem is that everywhere you look on this thing they are constatnly reminding you that you are driving a Chevy. They display that stupid Chevy "bow Tie" everywhere you look. IT is on the back  rest of every seat in bright yellow. Against black leather it seems a bit hickish. Its nice to remind people they are in a Caddy or a BMW or a Lexus but a Chevy? Come on!!  You may as well embroider "Ye Ha" on the seat back.  
 Other than the vulgar display of the Bow Tie everywhere I can't really find many complaints Other than price and gas milage.  You get 285 Horse power with the 350 v8. only problem is, it takes 250 of that 285 Hp to move a 3 ton vehicle.
 The 6 way leather seats are very comfortable. The cockpit is very driver friendly and the guages are easy to read. The north face edition has White gauges.
  The bed liner has a nice suprise. On each side there is a locking compartment that you store anything you want it. They have drain holes so you can even use them for a cooler.
Its a Suburban with a bed on the back. Best advice is to see what people have said about Suburbans.

Ok I have to update this review due to recent findings.  My friend with the North Face edition took his Avalanche on a trip to Colorado. When he got there his Oil light came on. He added a quart and a half of Oil and just figured the dealer might not have had it full before he left. Upon returning to Kansas City the same thing happened. Once again he was a quart and a half low. Also when starting the thing to leave his house it would fill the garage with smoke. Now Im not talking "James Bond smoke screen type smoke" but enough to make a noticeable cloud in the garage, and way more then an engine with 3000 miles on it should produce. Upon further investigation and a notification to the dealer he was told that many but not all of the Avalanches have a problem with the PCV valve. This causes the truck to burn oil. Im no mechanic so I dont know if that was a line of bull, but either way we are talking Major recall. Something needs to be done.
