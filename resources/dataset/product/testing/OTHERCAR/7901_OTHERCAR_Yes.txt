            After days of online research and lots of touchy feely I was totally won over by the Canon A20.  I own a Canon camcorder and was very impressed by the quality and ease of use.  This helped me make my decision for the A20.   

From the time I picked it up in Circuit City I knew I was holding a quality camera.  The weight and solid body feels great in your hands.  Almost like a professional 35mm.  I wasnt crazy about those micro mini digicameras.  Canon uses good quality plastics.  The buttons have a nice positive feel to them.  The screen is a decent size.  I use the camera mainly for posting pics on the web and snaping shots of my kids. Occasionally i'll print them on my HP photo printer; the 4x6 quality is outstanding.  Youll want to get a larger compact flash card.  This form of media is realy cheap now.  It took me no time at all to master the menu system.  Just give yourself about an hour or two with the manual and you'll be ok.  Give a look at the specs at the Canon web site.  One thing that I was mislead about was the use of alkaline batts with this unit.  Forget it.  The manual says you can but you'll get only a few shots off before it shuts down.  Go with the 1600mAh NiMH rechargebles.  You will be very happy with the battery life using the NiMH batts.  

For me, this was everything I needed in a digicamera without being overweighted with a lot of extras I wasnt going to use.  Avoid buying a camera sight unseen.  Go out and play with them at the store.  Take it home, use it, feel comfortable with it.  Most major electronic retailers have good return policies.   Buy with confidence.
