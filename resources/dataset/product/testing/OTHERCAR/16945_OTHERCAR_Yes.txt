            I bought a '96 Subaru Legacy Outback because it gave me the room I wanted, the four wheel drive and the headroom that my tall family needed.It does not drive like a wagon and there are some nice features. I enjoyed driving this one so much that when my lease was up, I leased the '99 version. The gas mileage is fairly good and now the '99 version doesn't need premium gas like the old one did. We use this car for bringing our sons to college, for going food shopping and to get supplies at Home Depot or the nursery. It just is an easy car to handle and is comfortable inside as well. The new 2000 model is sleeker and classier looking. This is the car to get if, like me, you hate those monster SUVs but still need room for car pooling and schlepping. This car will become more popular AS GAS PRICES CONTINUE TO CLIMB. i ESPECIALLY LIKE THE FACT THAT THIS CAR IS A LITTLER HIGHER OFF THE GROUND WHICH MAKES IT EASY FOR ME AS A TALL WOMAN TO GET IN AND OUT. You can get this model with the heating package, leather seats, CD player and moon roof. So go and get a Subaru Outback and see what I mean. I feel confident on the road in any weather. ENJOY!!!!!!<br><br>
