            I own a 1994 Dodge Ram 1500 4x4, it has a 5.9L(360cid) Magnum V8 fuel injected engine, with a 4spd automatic transmission, regular cab, and short bed. Well first things first, before my Ram I owned an 89 Dakota which had 175,000 miles on it when I traded it in on for my Ram. The Dakota had no real problems I just wanted a fullsize truck. So why a Ram? Well I have worked for the last two and a half years at a fast lube and out of all the trucks that I have seen come through the shop the Rams seem to be the most reliable and best looking. Chevrolet use way to much electronics to power their engines, personally I don't trust that much. Electronic systems don't usually react well to shock and when you are talking about a off road vehicle that is not a good thing. Ford well, lets put it this way ever signal Ford truck no matter what year(especially the new ones) came in to the shop At least a quart low on oil. Most of the time there was no oil at all on the dipstick meaning they where atleast two quarts low of oil. Rams on the other hand had no
major problems like this. Dodge use limited electronics to power the Ram's engines and the don't burn or leak oil nearly as much as a Ford would. I have owned my Ram for a year now and I have never had to take it in to the shop for anything more than rotine maintenance, and mine just last week rolled over to 100,000 miles, making it the most reliable vehicle I have ever owned. Okay lets talk about power, every one cuts down the ram because both Chevrolet and Ford offer more Horse Power. Lots of Horse power is good if you own a muscle car but, when you are talking about an off road truck lots of horse power can get you killed or hurt. I get about 230hp out of my 5.9L which is more than enough for me. I once out ran a 80 something V8 Firebird, so that�s nothing to shack
a stick at. The real treat with the Ram is though It puts out my Torque than either Chevrolet or Ford. Meaning more load and easier to get it around. I have hauled just about every thing you can think of with my ram from padio bricks to furniture and never had any problems with hills or anything of that nature. Plus inside the bed there are four cargo tie-down hooks for connivance have pulled boats and a camper that was bigger than the truck and never had any difficulty. The big 5x7 inch mirrors are nicely located for appearance and towing. The four speed automatic Transmission works nicely, shifting smoothly and handling the power well. So as far as power goes the Ram's got it where it really counts.The suspension rides a little rough, like a truck should. Chevrolet and Ford
both have nicer rides but, when you give a 4x4 truck a smooth ride you sacrifice off road ability and traction. The Ram is the only truck half ton truck made with a solid axle on the front end and the only truck that still use's the legendary Dana 44. The back end use's leaf springs going a good foundation for the Chrysler 9 1/4&quot;, rear axle.  The four-wheel drive system is the part that clinched the deal for me. The shift on the fly transfer case dose just that. I can shift my Ram into four-wheel drive at any speed that I want, I don't have to slow down or stop. I can take it out of four-wheel drive just the same. While Chevrolet and Ford use a push button style electronic system, which I just don't trust. Dodge still uses the hydraulic floor shift system. Why change what works.As far as looks go nothing beats it. Chevrolet and Ford have both tried to copy the front end appearance. The new Sliverado has the dropped headlights and hood contour lines, very similar to the Ram. The Ford super duties are the most obvious Ram rip-off and poorly in my opinion.
Another thing the grill on a Ram is connected to the hood you would not imagine how much easier it is to get at the engine like that. With the way Fords design the windshield
comes down right across the middle of the engine making accesses very difficult. Chevrolet has a very large radiator support making accesses unimaginably difficult. Ford has also now copied the four door Quad cab design as well. Chevrolet and Ford came out with the three door extended cab pick up truck first but, Dodge was the firs to offer an extra door on both sides which to me seems only logical. In essences nothing looks
tougher by me, the big-rig looks give the Ram an intimating appearance. The interior for a regular cab truck is surpassingly roomy. I have fit three full grown men in the cab and still had elbow room. It has amazing head and leg room. The seats are awesomely comfortable no matter how long you end up sitting in them. The sound system is great I have 8 speakers in 6 locations putting out a really nice sound no matter what kind of music you listen to. Every thing within the truck is conveniently located from the heater controls to the cruse control right on the steering wheel. The dash offer good lighting at night but, not over doing it like some vehicles where it is almost a destraction. Behind the seats I
have storage room for just about anything you are going to want to drag alone with you. I have fit my bow and shotgun back there. The truck came with two heave duty trays that connect to the back wall for storage. As well the jack and all the tools for that have there place inside the cab. One of my friends likes to comment on the seat belts because once
they lock up you are not going anywhere. For added security you got a drivers side airbag. There is plenty of room in the center console which folds up into the third seat. The power windows is a nice touch with how wide the cab is I would hate to have to reach over there to roll down the window. With My 2 year old daughter the power locks work nicely if I forget to lock her door I can do so with the touch of a bottom. If that�s not enough there is an extra power outlet on the dash and an overhead storage console. All and all I love my Ram. Some times maybe to much but, I went out and did my homework before I bought it and found that the Dodge Ram is the best truck made right now. See for yourself head on down to the Dodge dealership and take a ride. You will see for yourself what I am talking about.
