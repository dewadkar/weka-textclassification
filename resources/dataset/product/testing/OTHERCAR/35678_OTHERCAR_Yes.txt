            I would recommend this vehicle to my family, friends, and co-workers.  I have enjoyed driving this vehicle for many years now.  It has been about five years that I have had a Plymouth Grand Voyager and enjoy the smooth rids and the suspension is great.  The options on this vehicle is great to have.  I have Power locks, tilt steering, cruise control, A/C and a very nice AM/FM stereo cassette player.

This van has been so dependable that I have put on 153,000 miles on it and it is still going great.  The interior is very comfortable and the style matches the decore of the vehicle.

I have owned a Dodge Mini Ram Van and a Dodge Carivan and they both don't compare to the ride or comfort of this vehicle.  I have recomended this van to a co-worker and he had purchased a Plymouth van and he is very happy also with his purchase of the vehicle.

I am sure that you will enjoy the comfort and ride of this vehicle and will be very happy ing purchasing this vehicle.
