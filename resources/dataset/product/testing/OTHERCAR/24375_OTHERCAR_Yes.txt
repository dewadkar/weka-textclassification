            This is a dandy little camera to run around with... IF you are jus taking one or two pictures.  The swivel head on this camera make it a handy little versatile toy to take some shots with and the optional LCD backlight adds that extra little help in taking your pictures.

Unfortunately, the camera provides no dedicated control panel LCD and the LCD that it does have is unprotected so it could get damaged easily.  Also, the 4MB of memory this little camera carries is, not only substandard, but ridiculous for a 2megapixel+ camera!

On the better side, the 2.8x zoom and the MPEG movie option with video out make this a more versatile camera than most.

Overall, i think this is a good camera but it could use a little refinement.<br><br>
