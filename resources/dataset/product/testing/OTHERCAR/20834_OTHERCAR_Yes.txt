            The Toyota Prius is an amazing car.  The cutting edge technology leaves you excited for the future with a promise of a better place for everyone to live; cleaner air; less dependence on gas products and fossil fuels.  So, everyone is able to benefit from the choice you make.  You can feel good knowing you are not only saving money and getting better gas mileage but participating in providing cleaner air and a better world.

Every car has its trade-offs.  There are standard items, such as A/C, innovative automatic transmission and braking, power steering, power windows and locks, alarm, LCD touchscreen, etc. Yet, it comes with few options for the owner:  No cruise control;no armrest;no trunk opener;no interior color options; a few exterior color options;no sunroof or convertible. It also takes 3-6 months for delivery of the vehicle, which gives you a lot of time to think about the things you would like added to the car.
So, because this car is fun and purposeful, I decided, that the options I wanted I would have to make!  

Then, with the input from many other Prius owners, and my experience in electronic systems, I developed a remote controlled cruise control (great fun- like a handheld accelerator); a remote trunk opener (uses original Toyota remote); an Engine Run Indicator(lets me know when my car engine is ACTUALLY running-improves gas mileage); a custom armrest; a custom hitch for your bike rack; and even an audible reminder for when you have left your light switch on (not supposed to do that :).  All of these I use in my Prius.  It is great fun to be able to design and produce these accessories with the input and help of other Prius owners.  I receive phone calls with requests for designs for the Prius regularly and enjoy helping owners figure out how to create an option they are interested in.  You can contact me at support@coastalEtech.com, if you have any suggestions or surf my website at www.coastalEtech.com. 

Many people do not realize this car has been available in Japan for 3-4 years and is available all over the world. It has a track record of successful engineering and a long warranty for peace of mind.

Please look into vehicles that are environmentally-friendly.  They (hybrids) are easy and fun to drive, AND you feel good about your contribution.  This drives just like a "regular" car.  So, do what I did, take a test drive.  You'll be surprised!
