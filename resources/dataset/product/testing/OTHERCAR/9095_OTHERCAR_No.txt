            Dear educated and opinionated reader, 

	I write to you on a pressing issue; the infiltration of our country by poorly made oversized fun-land go karts (aka Kias). Has anyone out ther ever experienced a Kia. That's right I said experience because, once you've seen it your life will be changed forever.  That piece of 1967 petrified fecal matter sitting in your garage will never look so good.  This my friends is the only quasi-positive attribute of the Kia.  
	Aren't there any laws in this wonderful country about keeping pieces of junk like this off of the road.  I mean this poses an immense and even dangerous   situation.  Have you even been on the roadway and seen a Kia pass you, I imagine it has only happened to about five of you out there, but once when i was ridding my bike at a tortise-like pace  this tragady did occur.  The danger soon followed, i was so flabergasted that i laughed uncontrolably, swerving all over the rode in a reckless manner.  Heaven forbid I was in my car, real physical and emotional could have been caused.  
If you appreciated this please recommend it to your friends.  
	If you hated it do the same, so you and you hate filled frinds can have common hatereds.<br><br>
