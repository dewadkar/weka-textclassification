            I fell in love with this car back in 1993 when I first laid eyes on it in Car and Driver. A small blurb described the car and I hoped to one day have one. Fast forward to 2002 and the U.S. is finally privileged enough to get the WRX, albeit not the hotted up STi version (until 2004 that is!). I'll make this review brief. My car is a 2003 WRC blue sedan with a 5spd. I optioned it with the rear deck spoiler, armrest extension, boost gauge and stereo upgrade. When I bought it, I had the dealer install leather and a sunroof. I still cannot figure out why it took Subaru until 2004 to make the sunroof an option. I have owned the car for one year and have a little over 15,000 miles on it. The car is fast, handles better than an econo-based car should and looks good enough to please the young crowd and mature enough to please older professional sorts. The interior, while not expensive looking or feeling, is nice and well put together. No squeaks in my car, even with an aftermarket sunroof (which does NOT leak btw). The MOMO steering wheel is almost perfect (perfection being the new Nissan 350Z unit. Heavenly!) and the floormats, with the WRX logo, are seemingly well made. They haven't stained or torn. The exterior is great. I bought an '03 because of the bug-eye look. I absolutely love it. I have heard complaints from many WRX owners that the paint leaves a little to be desired. I have had NO problems whatsoever. No chips, no scratches, nothing. The car looks as good now as it did when I traded my Spec-V for it. The drawbacks to the car are few. While the car has plenty of room for me, it gets a bit cramped with 4 adults. The front seats are not as supportive as they should be. The stereo, while nice, is not the best. Perhaps that is why a stereo is an option on the STi. The 16' wheels are woefully inadequate to handle the potential of this car. Subaru has made it a habit to advertise the WRX with the optional BBS 17' wheels. Those babies are about $600 a piece from Subaru. Make them standard! I have had to take my car for repair work three times now and although it was covered under warranty, three 150 mile round trip visits are not fun. I have had to have the rotors turned (replaced the front ones), replace the left front strut (which is making noise AGAIN) and Subaru has yet to determine why the boost spikes on the car periodically. Despite these few complaints, I love this car and would buy another Subaru at the drop of a hat. It gets reasonable gas mileage (average over 15000 miles is 26.4 mpg), the AWD works well (acceleration is an incredible sensation with all 4 wheels going and wet driving is much more comfortable and less worrisome), the car is comfortable and above all, reliable. Sure I have a couple of issues with it, but what car doesn't have a problem or two? Get a WRX.
