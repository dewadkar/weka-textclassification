            I purchased my Rav 4 two months shy of two years ago.  I purchased it because our other car was only a two door and it was getting difficult to get my kids in and out of the car as they grew.  The Rav4 offered a sporty style, while giving the kids some ease of getting in and out of the back seat.  The back seats also recline so that the kids can lay them back and sleep on long trips.  These same seats also fold up, so that we can have more room in the back for bulkier items.

One of the things I love about this vehicle is that I no longer bump my head getting into the car.  The other thing that I love is the fact that I can see over other cars without being in something too bulky to drive.

What I dislike is the fact that, in my opinion, it uses up alot of gas on city driving.  My car gas bill has nearly doubled.

It seats four people comfortably, but I would not suggest any more than four people be in the car, even though Toyota says that it can seat five comfortably.  It seats three children under five, comfortably, in the back, but not adults.

This is a perfect car for women and men alike.  It is a very smooth ride on the highway, but has an awful squeak when you break.  I've taken mine in on several occasions and was told that there is nothing that can be done, as this particular vehicle tends to make that noise.

I would however, caution anyone over 5 feet, 7 inches tall to purchase this vehicle as there is not enough leg room for anyone over 5 feet, 5 inches tall.

Regardless of the vehicle you choose, I would have to tell you that I have loved the Customer Service I have received with Toyota's service department.  So if this is something you look into when purchasing a vehicle, this is a plus factor.<br><br>
