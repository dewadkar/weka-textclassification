            Oh yeah.What can i say, this car is awesome.Honda had done it again by making this nice,fast,dependable car.Both models type sh and regular are fast.This car is on top of the list of imports.It matches up with the integra type r.It both has the same horse power but the type r is slightly faster because it weighs lesser.But i recommend the prelude to everybody because it looks better.Have you seen the engine? Oh me oh my the engine kicks a**.You do not need to even upgrade it with headers and intakes and stuff and it will still be fast.This car is a chick magnet.Girls just dig it.Only reason people don't like about this car is that it doesn't have much room in the back for adults to sit.Why complain about that when it's a sports car, if you want more room get a minivan or something.What else can i say about this car but just watch out and move out the way when you see one before it leave you with some dust.<br><br>
