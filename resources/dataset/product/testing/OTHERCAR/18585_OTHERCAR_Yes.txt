            After researching a ton of digital cameras my husband called me and said HSN had this one on and to take a look at it. 

I was a little leary as I have had problems with 2 other digital cameras and them working with my emachines computer and Windows ME. I thought well I won't know till I try it.

I was pleasantly surprised when the installation went without a hitch....from installing software to taking pictures! I was looking for a 2 megapixel camera for pics of our family that I could enlarge up to an 8 x 10 with 35 mm quality...this is it!!! I usually take pics without the screen on as this does drain the batteries faster.  I have not found a problem with the batteries draining fast with regular usage and using the viewfinder. The menu screen is very easy to use; a matter of using arrows which I hope we all understand. The top of the camera is very simple to understand...it has an icon for taking a picture, one for viewing the pic and one for video...not difficult at all. The camera is lightweight and perfect for my hand as well as that of my husband who has large hands. 

Our daughter, almost 4 yrs old, takes pics for me and they are beautiful. She knows that when the light is green to take the pic and when it is orange to wait...a matter of seconds. 

The self timer is a nice addition...as we often want a family pic taken and no one around to take it. I have recently used this in the rain on our daughter's field trip..altho I wouldn't recommend getting it too wet. The rain was coming down and it was dark and miserable and the pics are beautiful....the colors stand out wonderfully.

The memory cards are not expensive any more. Mine came with a 16 mb card I believe and I can take 100 pics on it....I always take pics in the fine resolution so I can get the best photo quality out of each shot. It is nice to have removable memory as you can buy as big or small memory as you need....ex 8 mg or 128 mb. I am planning on buying a 16 or 32 mb card as a backup so I can continue shooting without having to delete any pics.

I also like the fact that there is no double pressing the button to take the pic. Some digitals require you to press and hold or press twice. This one you press and hold if you want to or just press and it takes the shot.

The only thing I had trouble with at first is taking pics without any shake!!!! My regular 35 mm camera is bulky....so I was used to that weight. However, after maybe 3 shots that were shaky my pics began to get better and better with no shake whatsoever. 

I have used the digital zoom to look at the pictures on the screen but haven't developed any that I have left in the zoom mode...as I am usually close enough to the subject or background I am taking a picture of.

I have uploaded pictures to walmart on their website and had the exact same pictures developed off of my memory card to see if the photo quality is the same. I thought that the walmart ones would be nice in case I am not up to going out 8 mos pg and with a 4 yr old. I must say that the uploaded pics were the same quality as the ones directly off my memory. The only difference is if you take the memory in with you...the photo people can brighten, darken or balance any colors in the picture which is nice if you are enlarging them etc.
 
Unfortunately, I have had my camera fall of my desk about 5 times....and so far not a scratch...no problem with the camera at all!!!!

I have used the movie section a few times and loved it...takes a few minutes to upload the video but it is great!!!

The only thing I can think of as a con...is not really a con....I tend to take TOO many pictures and then figuring out the cost of 100 pics...thank goodness the prices have come down to about .26 cents a picture!!!!

Fuji is known for their film quality and their digital camera quality as far as color, depth etc.... they definitely out did themselves on this camera.
