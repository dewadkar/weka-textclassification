            I know what you're thinking.  Buick...I know, I know.  But before you begin evoking the land yachts of yore, take a look at the specs on this one.  3600 lbs curb weight, 3800cc supercharged engine, 6.5 seconds 0-60 (better than any Toyota or Honda rice rocket, I might add), and a set of some of the most comfortable seats I've been in.  Nearly 18 feet long, this is a formidable car, no doubt.  But it's got enough go to get granny and her groceries home in no time flat.  The engine will purr like a kitten and return good fuel efficiency, giving away the fact that it's a V6.  But hit the accelerator right, feel the blower kick on, and you'll think you're dipping into a V8.  225 horsepower and 260 lb/feet of torque is quite a bit for a car like this, one of the most powerful cars in the 1993 American lineup.

One caveat:  if you're interested in the Park, take my advice and go for the uplevel Ultra.  Base model is not supercharged, and the horsepower figures (not to mention your boy-racer instincts) will feel the difference.  16 inch wheels are another option on the base model that comes standard on the Ultra.  On the 16's you also get much more attractive rims, giving the car an overall more graceful look.  Mounted thereupon is fat 215 wide rubber, which will spin readily under the input of your right foot.

This car is a departure from the underpowered land yachts of model years past.  Large, no doubt, but worth its weight, this Buick is a quality, classy car, not short on power.  Go for it.<br><br>
