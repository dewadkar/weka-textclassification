            Okay all you yuppy bafoons in your over priced, gas guzzling, S.U.V's.  Step aside!  There's a new hot rod in town- the Sports Wagon. The Volvo X-Country is the answer to all your dreams.  If you like the roominess of your S.U.V, but are tired of the number of times you have to fill it up.  Or enjoy being able to go &quot;off-roading&quot; but hate flashing everyone when you try to get in it while in a skirt.  If you cherish  the small things in life like good leather, seat warmers, and a dog divider to keep the pooches off your lap... LOOK NO FURTHER!  I have never loved a car until now.  And it wasn't the kind of love that has to grow on you after several dates, the dealership made it so easy, it was love at first sight.  I never felt pressured to buy this car.  In fact, the most difficult choice I had to make was on the color.  Now why would you buy anything less? Yea-Baby !<br><br>
