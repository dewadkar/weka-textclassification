            I've owned a 95 Chevrolet Corsica for about a year now.  I bought it from my father who owned it originally and maintained it impeccably.  After I bought it, I realized just what it take to maintain this car as he did.  The Corsica will not last forever.  More likely, only 100,000 miles.  I'm at 90,000 right now and over the last 10,000 miles I have had to replace the brakes, the alternator, tires (it seems to wear through tires quickly), and the hood release.  Now, I know the car is getting up there in miles, but this many repairs so quickly (and more to come) leads me to doubt its quality.

But that's one thing.  This car has many highlights.  It's the perfect size for one or two people.  Smaller cars like the cavalier get cramped regardless of the number of people and their size.  Larger cars are a waste of money if you don't need it.  The seats in the Corsica are great.  The back seat will hold adults, but not for long.  The trunk is huge for a car this size.

The six cylinder is definately preferable for this car.  150hp is nothing spectacular but in a car that weighs less than 3000lbs, it's bound to impress you.  The handling is slightly above average.<br><br>
