            I received the Fuji FinePix 2600 digital camera as an early Christmas gift from my husband.  Since then, I haven�t touched my 35mm camera.  I am a member of three separate MyFamily.com websites and I like to frequently add current photos of my children for distance relatives to view.  Before getting the Fuji FinePix 2600, I would either have to scan in my 35mm photos or upload digital stills from my camcorder.  Taking photos with my 35mm camera, developing the film and then scanning each photo in was very time consuming.  The digital stills from my camcorder were quick and easy, but the quality of the photos is low.  The FinePix 2600 gives me instant digital pictures that are better quality than the scanned images from my 35mm camera.  I have also had 4x6 and 5x7 photo prints made from these digital photos and the quality is the same as those made from 35mm film.  To get the best prints, the camera setting should be set on either the fine or normal 2 megapixal setting.  I�ve had prints made on the camera�s default setting of 1.3 megapixals and those images were of less quality than my regular 35mm prints.  

The Fuji FinePix 2600 camera comes with everything you will need to get started.  It includes a 16 MB SmartMedia card, two AA rechargeable batteries, a USB device cable, and a batter charger.  I find the 16MB SmartMedia card to be more than adequate for me.  It holds about 20 images taken on the fine 2 megapixal setting.  The normal 2 megapixal setting will hold 39 images that adequate enough to make good 4x6 photo prints.  You may want to get additional SmartMedia cards if you won�t be transferring the images to your computer right away.  Also, the battery lasts a long time as long as you don't use the LCD screen a lot.  I only use the LCD quickly to view the quality of pictures after I take them.  Using the LCD to take pictures will really drain down the battery quickly so you'll want an extra set of rechargeable batteries. 

The FinePix 2600 camera comes with impressive features.  These features are easily accessed from menus displayed on the color LCD.  There is a setting for close up images which I had used to make 8x10 prints using my inkjet printer and photo paper.  The detail was amazing and I was surprised how nice the 8x10 photos came out on my printer.

The one complaint I have about this camera is that the images tend to be a bit on the dark side.  I have been able to fix this problem by using digital image editing software.  Usually a slight brightness adjustment is all that I need to do.
