            With my trusty Nissan 240SX getting longer in the tooth and more expensive to maintain, it was time to look for a new ride.  After looking at the Infiniti G35, Acura RSX, the Audi TT and new A4, the Mercedes C230 Coupe as well as the BMW 3 and 5 series, I locked in on the M Coupe.  

I fell for the M Coupe in 1999, but it didn't fit my needs at the time.  This time around,  I decided I could live with a narrowly focused performance car.  It became a tossup between the M3 and the M Coupe.  In the end, I became obsessed with the M Coupe's distinctive styling and performance.  After all, there were plenty of 3 series coupes running around town that kind of obscured the M3, while Z3 coupes were rare enough, and M even more so.  I found a couple of red M Coupes in dealer showrooms, but I thought silver or black would be the color.  Thus began a 3 month ordeal of daily net searches for the perfect, used M Coupe.  I had almost given up hope, when a silver one finally turned up with just 30k miles.  After several phone and e-mail exchanges, I could not wait any longer and made an offer I hoped would be too good to refuse.  

Some people say it's odd, others consider it beautifully functional.  Almost all take notice of the M Coupe.  That distinctive style comes from extending the sheetmetal from the convertible's short windshield all the way to the back end.  This gives the Coupe a look that's kind of reminiscent of classic cars in the 20's and 30's.  From the back, it's all modern, with wide flared fenders, the fat rear tires, the twin dual exhausts and the cooling fins on the differential combine to symbolize raw power.  The inline-6 necessitates a form that looks awfully long nosed and front heavy, but like all BMW's the M coupe achieves near 50/50 weight distribution.  

Living with the M Coupe can be difficult.  For my 5'11", 190lb. body, it's a tight fit.  That short windshield adapted from the convertible makes it impossible to see the traffic light without bending down and looking up.  The leather seats are firm, but do not lean back far enough to suit me, and will not move forward enough to suit my 5'-2" wife.  This seat also moves a bit under braking, as if some teeth are missing out of the worm gear.  

This car can be hard to see out of, especially in the left rear quarter.  Changing lanes require a second look.   I thought the long nose would make the front of the car difficult to feel, but with the short overhang and good feedback from the steering, that has not been a problem.  

The A/C can not keep up with the summer heat here during the middle of the day, especially in stop and go traffic. When I run the engine hard, it feels warmer inside.   Wimpy A/C was also a problem in my old A4, maybe it's a German thing.  The fan  keeps blowing air at the 0 setting.  

As far as comfort goes, don't expect much.  The ride is quite harsh, and there's a lot of road and wind noise in the cabin.  As mentioned before, the seat has limited adjustability.  The small cargo area will carry my golf clubs, but it took several tries to get them to fit.  The speed variable audio system is marginalized by the road noise, making rock and reggae my choice of music (as opposed to smooth jazz and classical in the A4 and Acura).  Oh, before you take a trip in this car, make sure you enroll in a roadside assistance program.  The M carries no spare tire.  

I had one scary moment at a toll booth.  To select reverse, you must press down and pull firmly toward you then up.  Which is why i can't explain how i just casually popped it into gear and the car shot backwards.  Fortunately, the car behind me gave me a good bit of room, but I am very cautious now when selecting first.  

All the shortcomings are forgiven when the M coupe is given the chance to strut its stuff.  With 225's up front and 245's in the back, the M feels glued to the road.  Power surges from the 3.2 liter engine, rocketing the vehicle forward.    I have never driven a car this quick.  And as the speed goes up the suspension comes to life.  The ride is much better above 80 than it was below. The M steers precisely and offers good feedback, and you feel every detail of the road.  The front Dunlops look slightly worn right now and the car pushes (understeers) a bit, I will report later if new tires cure this.  The manual five speed and the clutch took some getting used to for smooth operation, but the short throws result in crisp engagement.  The M closes on traffic so quickly, it's a good thing that the brakes are up to snuff.  I don't think I've driven a car that stops quicker.  With all this performance, the car is surprisingly efficient.  I averaged 25mpg on mixed city and highway driving.

All in all, the M Coupe is an uncompromising and highly capable sports car.  It's definitely not for everybody, and you have to forgive its small faults.  For the right person, the rewards are well worth it.  This car works for me because I have a comfortable cruiser and a work car.  If you come looking here for a sports car, you won't be disappointed.  

I will report later on the reliability of this car.
