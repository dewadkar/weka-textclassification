            In 3/96, I borrowed a family friend's 1994 Toyota Previa to pick up a new dinette set.  The ride was so smooth and the handling was so sharp but when it held all that furniture, I knew I had to have one!  I finally found my 1993 LE in 8/96 - 4 years and 125,000 miles later it is still going strong &amp; I have yet to find a &quot;new&quot; model minivan to top it or to consider as a replacement.  It is the most comfortable vehicle I have ever sat in.  With lower back problems haunting both my husband &amp; I, comfort is very important.  I love the 2 middle captain chairs that swivel and all the room to haul our &quot;stuff&quot; (With a toddler &amp; an infant, there is alot of STUFF - double stroller, baby bag etc...) It is easy to get in &amp; out of the 3rd row seat and our family have spent many campouts in this van.   For me practicality and necessity are more important than accessories &amp; luxury.  But there are the double sunroofs, the cd/tape/am&amp;fm radio and the dual ac/heating system.  All items I am pleased they came with the vehicle. The only thing that is lacking is the double sliding doors, but back then, it was not available.  With a 4 cylinder it does not go from 0 to 60 in 4.5 but it does do the speed limit or more without much effort.  And with the price of gas being what it has been for the past 6 months, I have been ever so grateful for not having one of those big SUV gas guzzlers.  My dad even bought the same model in 11/99.  I'm just sorry Toyota doesn't make this model anymore.  I would certainly get another one, but this time with 2 sliding doors! But I would still keep this model as a 2nd car.<br><br>
