              In 1999 the Mitsubishi Galant was totally redesigned into the sexy, sleek, and lovable looking car that it is today. For the 2002 model year the Galant was given a new front fascia which added a little kick to this already sexy automobile. Although Looks is one of the Galant's strong assets, there are a few, but important shortcomings that make the Galant the poster child/car for the expression 'Beauty is only skin deep.'

  For 2002 the Galant comes in 6 different trim lines, the DE, the ES, ESV6, Ls, Ls V6, and the GTZ. My test Galant included dubbed the LS was matched with a SOHC 2.4 liter 4-cylinder that pumped out an acceptable 140 horsepower and 155 lb-ft of torque. The other engine available on the ES, LS and standard on the GTZ is a 3.0 SOHC V6 that offers a more exciting 195 horse power, and an adequate 205 lb-ft of torque for hauling around the weight/occupants of this car. I did not get to test drive the V6 model, but I'm going to go out on a limb here and say "the performance is probably much better than with the 4-cylinder powered models." 

<i>Driving Impressions:</i>


My test car's engine was mated with a smooth shifting 4-speed automatic, but with a curb weight of almost 3,200 lbs, acceleration came slow and painful. At idle the engine is quiet, with a slight vibration felt in the wheel, this vibration is very common with most 4-cylinder engines, especially 4 bangers with a small displacement. The 140 horse power and the 155 lb-ft of torque are both reached at a relatively peaky RPM, so you end up gaining speed at the end of the on-ramp instead of at the beginning. My test drive was a total of 12 miles from Eureka to Loleta California. The drive was neither exciting nor fun, and I found myself for the first time using the cruise control feature on the way back to the dealership in an 'I give up' fuss. On the contrary to the commercials, I did not feel like singing out tunes from trendy rock bands, or for that matter even driving any further. With a sticker price of $23,000 I was amazed with the performance of this vehicle, or I should say 'lack of.' 
<b>Cruising</b> on the other-hand is hushed, the cabin is well insulated, even when this car gets caught up on a steep hill, the engine noise of 5,000  RPM that is needed for this heavy weight to make it up the incline was surprisingly muffled. Bumps and rattles are also kept to a minimum. <b>Handling</b> is adequate in the 2002 Galant, not exciting, not road hugging, but simply 'ok'. The steering is responsive, but the suspension lacks any sort of sporty feeling. I found both the 2002 Nissan Altima, and 2002 Honda accord more capable on the twistys than the Galant LS, not to mention more fun (relatively speaking of course). Braking was excellent however, with 4 wheel ABS standard on this model, it made for sure stops, and confidence when approaching a red light. 
<b>NOTE:</b> Expect to get around 28 mpg while doing freeway driving with the 4-cylinder engine. Just to do a little comparison, 28 MPG is what a 320 horse powered, 5.7 liter, Z28 Camaro is rated, a 255 horse powered Nissan Maxima is rated at 29 MPG, which leads me to this question. Is it really necessary for this car to come with a 4-cylinder? Also note that a 4-speed automatic is the standard, and to my understanding, the only transmission available. 

  The 2002 Mitsubishi Galant sits on a relatively short 103.9" wheelbase, and has an overall length of 187.8." The <b>Suspension</b> is Macpherson struts all around and is coil sprung, with a front stabalizer bar.

<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

  The <b>Interior</b> of the Mitsubishi Galant LS is nothing less than wonderful, and was a sight for sore eyes after driving a <a href="/content_56290872964"> 2002 Kia Rio</a>. Amenities are plentiful in this sedan. Some standard and optional amenities in my test car included, a thick leather wrapped steering wheel, power sunroof, dual air bags, a digital clock, tachometer, and power everything. The stereo CD system was by Infinity, and while the sound of this system did not blow my skirt up, the system really was refined for a car in this class. The cloth seats are both very comfortable and supportive and came with 8 way adjustments. The interior trim was all very tasteful, and there is plenty of room for 5 adults.

<i>Exterior Innovation:</i> 

  The <b>Exterior</b> is very sleek and chiseled. I have always been very partial to the Galant's exterior since it became a sex symbol in 1999. Although many criticize the Galant for being a plain jane, I have always found her very sexy. While the Galant looks a tad bit boxy, it does so with more class than expected. Cab forward designs are a very trendy feature with cars today. For example, cars like the 2002 dodge Neon, from outside it almost looks like the driver is going to slip foreword out of his or her seat through the windshield. With the 2002 Mitsubishi Galant you will notice that this car does not look cab forward hardly whatsoever, yet retains a very modern look. 15" alloy rims are standard on the LS, Fog lamps, and a modest spoiler add a sporty touch. There still is the ever present Mitsubishi badge ( a diamond shape) plastered on the updated grille.

 <b>Price, Warranty</b> The LS starts out at around $22,000, and can reach almost $24,000!!!! I find it very hard to fathom buying a $24,000 car and only getting the pleasure of having a 140 horse powered 4-cylinder under my hood. Although Power is not synonymous with quality, performance is synonymous with luxury and value in todays market. With the lackadaisical performance you get with the 2.4 liter engine, it is beyond me why Mitsubishi would use this engine in such a large sedan. If you do choose to buy this car, you have a standard 3 year 36,000 mile warranty.


<i>Final Thoughts:</i>

The 2002 Mitsubishi Galant offers some excellent attributes, however the negatives here totally outweigh the positives. Price, performance, and lack of a solid warranty kills my recommendation.

-Happy Car Shopping!
