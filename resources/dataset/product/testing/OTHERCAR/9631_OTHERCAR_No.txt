            It's sharp-looking and fun. It has 4-wheel drive for the snowy days and you can remove the top in the summer when it's hot.  The Tracker gets great mileage and so far, the maintenance cost has been low.  But if you want to know the not-so-great points of this vehicle, I can tell you.

  First of all, it's difficult to adjust your position in the seat.  There is nothing to hold on to while you dig your feet in to move!  And if the mat is wet from rain or snow, your feet slide besides.

  The seat belts are also uncomfortable.  They rub against your chin and neck and are very awkward to adjust.  Also, there is no middle console to rest your arm on.  So if you are planning to drive for awhile, plan on your arm getting tired of hanging.  

  Another BIG problem is the way the windows fog up.  In the winter, you have to turn the air conditioner on with the heat to keep the moisture down in the vehicle.  In the summertime, you can't run the air conditioner too cool.  If the temperature inside the vehicle is vastly cooler than the temperature outside the vehicle, the windows fog up. 

  And then there's the bar across the back between the rear window and the tailgate.  It's very difficult to get packages in and out of the back with that bar dividing the space.  Then your clothes rub against the back bumper as you struggle to reach for things and you get all dirty.

  Lastly, the rear seat support constantly rattles.<br><br>
