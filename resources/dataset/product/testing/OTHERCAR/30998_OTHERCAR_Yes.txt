            This car is not for the faint-hearted nor for those who are content on simply getting from point A to point B anonymously to commuters around you. 
I was a very ardent fan of the Mitsubishi 3000GT VR4, which I incidentally crashed on a high speed turn. Humans learn it the hard way and bought a VW Cabrio to console myself and to take things easy. But the need for speed overtook my senses and I went looking for a Supra Turbo. I'd heard of its reputation as a detuned supercar but wasn't really impressed with it still during a test drive in a friend's '93 Supra Turbo. Nonetheless, I reluctantly bought the car anyway and drove it bone-stock for about a year. 
I slowly upgraded little thing in the car like a downpipe, an exhaust system, and over the course of a year, I had brought the horsepower to approx 450hp.

And that's when the bug hit. These were still considered Basic Power Upgrades and I finally made the decision to go for an Advanced Power Upgrade that would drive the horsepower to an obscene 650++ rear-wheel hp.

This car was essentially made for some serious after-market upgrades and there are many products available at the moment specially catering to the Supra.

The ride quality is affected by only as much as you change the suspensions and shocks. It still retains a stiff ride and control is excellent. There is nothing really to hate about the car except for the stereo system which, in my opinion, isn't all that great. Also, the seats need work as passengers and driver tend to slide around a little during those high-G turns. And lastly, don't believe the 2+2 ploy....there really isn't any room at the back for anyone!! :)<br><br>
