            i remember when i learned that we were getting the civic SI last year how 
much i was anticipating a car like the integra type-R.a few months later they arrived!i was there when my local dealership got their first one.an
electron blue SI,i was amazed.i examined that car inside and out,wishing 
for a test drive.just the color itself was enough to sell the car.a few months after that,my cousin purchased a black SI.i went straight to his house.my first impression was how comfortable the integra seats were,the way the shift knob felt in my hands,the electric sunroof,and the gauges are just beautiful.but once on the road everything is great except for the clutch.handling,brakes,acceleration is all good but the clutch just plain out slips during shifts.factory power is ok but not great either,another 40 hp would do great along with a A.C.T. clutch.it really doesnt compare to a integra type-R like i thought it would but it still a 
very good car and fun to drive as long as you keep it about 5000 rpms.
