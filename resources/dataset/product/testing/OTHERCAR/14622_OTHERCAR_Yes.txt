            I bought this car "certified used" in October '02. It had 34k miles on it. I have now (Dec. '03) 47k miles and have not had any problems other than light bulbs occasionally going out. This is not due to electrical problems cited by other reviewers, but simply because of the running lights. Since they greatly improve safety and my Volvo dealer replaces them happily for free I'm not too concerned about it. 

The seats have to be the most comfortable in the industry. In fact, I mainly bought this car because I had one as a rental years ago and still remembered how great the seats were. My Volvo is the "base model" (165hp), loaded with most options (leather, Tracs, sun roof, CD, etc.). 
The leg room in the front and back is great. It is actually better in the back than in newer S60 or V70 Volvos. 

The handling is extremely predictable. It is somewhat of a sporty drive, but certainly not a sports car. I find the acceleration sufficient, but have to admit that comfort and safety are more important to me than speed. I seriously doubt that anybody who is into fast cars would seriously consider this Volvo, so you pretty much get what you would expect.

Even though mine doesn't have all-wheel drive, I feel comfortable taking it into the mountains during the winter. It has TRACS, which as I understand it utilizes the ABS breaks to prevent slipping of the front wheels at low speeds. It also has a winter driving mode for the automatic transmission, which reduces the torque by never shifting below third gear. Both of these features really only help you to get going by preventing slipping at low speeds and don't do much once you break 25 mph, but they are nice to have. Given that it's front wheel drive and the handling overall is very mild-mannered, I'm actually more comfortable driving this car in the snow than I was with my '98 Explorer with 4-wheel drive. 

I am not sure why this is, but for some reason the resale value for these isn't great. It worked in my favor since I bought it used, but looking at KBB and NADA, I am finding that I would never sell it for what I could get for it now. But that isn't really an issue, since I can honestly say that after a year I still enjoy driving this car like I did the first day. I'm the kind of person who grows tired of cars quickly, on average only owning them 2-3 years. This one I can see myself owning for a long time.
