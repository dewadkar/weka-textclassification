                 I got the privilege to try out a 2000 Neon for the weekend and I must say I didn't want to give it back.  I really enjoyed the car.  It fit my whole family perfect. Loved having four doors and it still had lots of room.  The back seats folded down to make our ski trip a breeze.  
     I must admit that I had always disliked the Neon�s until I had the chance to try it.  I always thought that Neon�s were disposable cars, you know where they last until the last payment is paid and then something devastating happens.   
     The Neon has also improved in the design of the exterior.  I really liked the shape.  It looked like a compacted Intrepid.
     If I were in the position to buy a new car the Neon would definitely be in my list of cars to choose from.
