            We decided in a week's time to trade our 1990 GMC Safari Van in because the motor was bad, and the transmission was questionable.  As a family of five, we needed a roomy car, yet nothing too bulky.  I needed something dependable that required little maintenance.  My husband bought me a 1999 Chevrolet Lumina.  We've had it for a year now, and I LOVE IT!

ROOMY AND COMFORTABLE
We have plenty of room for our toddler's car seat and two more half grown children in the back seat.  We often take our car on 6 hour trips, and we've yet to have a problem with space.  My sister-in-law and I ride in the back seat when we go out.  We ride perfectly comfortably, with plenty of room to spare.  My husband is 6 ft. 2 in. tall, with long legs and arms.  He requires room to move (my forehead and his elbow have often tried to occupy the same space at the same time.)  He has yet to complain about being cramped.  And he says that it isn't too low to the ground either.

We bought our Lumina with a motorized sun roof. We can open it while we're driving down the highway and forget that it's even open.  But even without the sun roof, there is great air flow in the car. The heater heats and the A/C cools quickly. In the last year, we've had one problem.  When we slowed down or turned, cold wet steam would come out of the vents, along with a squeal.  This only happened on really hot days or when we drove the car more than &quot;around town&quot;.  We couldn't get it in to be looked at right away, so my husband decided to have a peek at the [drip pan?].  Sure enough, there was a screw stuck in the drain hole, so it wasn't draining properly when the A/C ran. He took care of it and it's been working great ever since.  

KID FRIENDLY
The car came with child safety locks. I love that feature. These special locks are located in the door latch area (the kids don't even know they're their!). It's just a little white piece of plastic with holes in it. We use one of our keys to slide the lock and the kids can't open the doors from the inside of the car.  Yet, all we have to do is open the doors from the outside.   

My  kids quickly figured out that they could reach out their windows and open the door with the outside handle. Which brings me to another feature. The power windows, master remote of which is located on the driver's door, have a lock feature too!  If I push the button in, the windows don't operate from anywhere in the car, but my door!  I like that.  The back windows only open halfway,too, which is yet another safety feature.  Now, my older daughter uses the time it takes for me to open her door to get her younger sister out of her car seat.  Isn't that nice of her?!

The shoulder seat belts in the back seat have plastic clips on them, to make the seat belts fit my kids better.  These clips are attached to the back seat with a short bungie.  It easily comes off of the shoulder belt to adjust for an adult.  There are pockets on the back of the front seats that we can put books and brochures in for the kids to read, and even with the shoulder belt on, the kids can reach them. The middle seat is where we put my youngest child's car seat because it's equipped with a lap belt.  

HANDLES GREAT!
I prefer front wheel drive.  This car has it.  Our roads get pretty yucky in the winter.  I am so glad that we bought this car.  It was great on the slick roads. I have no problem working out of mud or snow with my front wheel drive.  I easily drove to my Mom's 5 miles out in the country while the roads were drifting.  

With a V6 engine, it has good pick-up for passing and what-not, though I wouldn't run in any races. We get decent gas mileage.  I believe about 25 mpg/city and 29 mpg/highway.  My husband tells me it shuts down at 100 MPH.  I can drive down the country roads at 55 mph (except when the corn is up) without the factory installed cd player skipping a beat. It runs very quietly, too.  Sometimes it's hard to tell if I've started it or not.

OTHER FEATURES I LIKE
I know nothing about stereos or electronics, but this car has some neat features.  It has a lock on the stereo.  You pick a number code.  Enter it into the stereo and it locks.  No one can use the stereo until you unlock it.  I've not used this.  I am entirely too trusting with my belongings, but we won't talk about my bad habits.

The sound adjust to the car sound, too! Say you're pulling up to a busy intersection off of the interstate. You see workers on the side of the road. You don't have to turn the volume of the radio down. It's smart sound decreases when you're speed decreases. Oh, and it has typical tones set for different types of music (country, pop rock, jazz, etc.). So if you listen to different types of music, you don't have to constantly mess with the bass and treble and all that stuff to make it sound better. Just hit the appropriate button.  

There is an arm rest that pulls down in the middle of the front seat.  It holds CD's, has a coin holder, and has room for junk. Only thing is, once you put change in the coin holder, you don't want to lift the arm rest back into the back of the seat. All the change comes loose in between CD's and stuff. As with all arm rests like this, I wouldn't recommend excessive weight be applied.  

I like the cubby holes too. It has one on each of the front doors and one on the left hand side of the steering wheel (that's my secret stash cubby hole.) I hide bank suckers in there, as well as change from Dairy Queen. The long slots in the doors are perfect for check book, cds, pens, maps, etc. Though, keep in mind that paper blows in the wind, as does the car door when it's opened.

A SAFE CAR FOR MY FAMILY
As a coincidence, our car was the first car on the seen of a fatal motorcycle accident last year.  This accident occurred on June 17, 1999.  (The coincidence is that my Mom passed away the same day this year.)  It was 11:00 p.m. and we were coming home from a neighboring town, with our three sleeping children buckled in the back seat. We had just turned onto a nice, wide, well-paved state road that goes to our house, in town.  It was outside of town so there were only our headlights to light the area.  It was a beautiful night, with clear skies, so no need for bright lights.  

When we saw all of the debris in the road, we slowed down, but couldn't comprehend what we were seeing.  My husband, realizing what this was, slammed on the brakes and we stopped very quickly.  When he looked out of his window and saw the young man lying twistedly in the road, he gassed on the car to get our kids out of viewing range and to turn around to aim the headlights for us to be able to see once we got out.  I'll never know how we managed to dodge it all.  But, I thanked God that night for great brakes, seat belts, it's quick maneuvering and the fact that we had just bought that car the previous week!  

Our van wouldn't have handled as well and this tragedy could have been even worse for our little town.  It was a two motorcycle accident involving 4 local teenagers that &quot;everyone&quot; knew, who were out for a short ride.  No alcohol or drugs, just a ride.  There was nothing we could do while we waited for help.  All four of these young people died that night. I thought it was the worst night of my life.  (I had no idea that one of those kids' mother's would be consoling me at my mother's memorial exactly one year later.)

I thank my lucky stars that we bought our Lumina when we did.  Our seatbelts worked properly, our car maneuvered well.  The brakes performed their job!  All in all, I feel that buying a 1999 Chevrolet Lumina was a safe and sound decision for our family to make.  <br><br>
