            When we were looking for a newer used car we went to the import center.  We looked at Subarus and Toyotas.  One of the vehicles we test drove was a 1998 SR5 Toyota 4Runner.  The 4Runner is a conventional SUV, based on the Tacomoa Pickup.  The first thing you think when you get into the vehicle is how high up you have to step.  
The Interior:
The interior dosen't exactly feel roomy.  It has a confined atmosphere especially in the rear seat.  Being an SUV it has a high seating position allowing you to see over almost anything on the road, but the seats are too close to the floor, creating an uncomfortable driving position (one you might expect from a compact sedan). Being truck based the 4Runner has a large loading capacity, but a modest cargo area.  You must strain your back in order to lift objects into the high cargo area.  
Engine:
The engine is the usual 3.0L V-6 found in many Toyota products.  It provides only average acceleration in the 2 ton plus 4Runner.  Passing power is modest.  The engine performes silently under most circumstances and delivers acceptable fuel economy upper teens for city driving and low 20's for highway cruising. There have been a couple problems with this engine though, the engine gasket is prone to leaking on higher mileage vehicles.  
Buying:
The 4Runner is an expensive vehicle usually acquired with  high mileage (above 100,000 miles) While Toyota products have a reputation for lasting a long time the parts are very expensive, especailly for 4wd models.  You can find more standard features for a lot less money too.  Despite the high cost of buying and owning the vehicle it dosen't offer full-time 4wd like most of its competition.  4wd can be used on dry pavement and usually improves handling.  The 1998 Trooper, Grand Cherokee, SLX, Discovery and Montero offer this system, many for thousands less.
