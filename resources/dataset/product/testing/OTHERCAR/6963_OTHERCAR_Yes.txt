            What I love about the blazers is that they are sporty looking, affordable, nice an roomy, and dependable.  They drive smooth. They have a comfortable setting.  And they are great with gas.  And most of all, it has great luggage space.  Whereas, with some of the other utility vehicles do not have enough luggage space.   

Driving a blazer is like driving on clouds.  You never know that you are moving and you hardly ever feel all the bumps and pot holes that are in the streets or on the highways.  They seat extremely comfortable for people who may have back problems.  What I really like is how you don't have to step up  real high just to get in to the vehicle.  With some utility vehicles, it's like stepping into an eighteen wheeler rode truck trying to get it.  

Who should buy this vehicle?  I think that a chevy blazer is for those people with lots of class and great taste.  This vehicle is for those that want to look great, feel great, and not have to feel like you've spent a fortune.  <br><br>
