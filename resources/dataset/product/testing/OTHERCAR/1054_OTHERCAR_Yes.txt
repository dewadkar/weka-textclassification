            Having previously owned a Mitsubishi Eclipse, i was in the market for something roomier, easier to get in and out of, and that had ample space for carseats without crowding myself and my passengers.  Being a young parent i just wasnt ready to jump into the world of &quot;family cars&quot;, or mini vans.  I went alone oneday on a spur of the moment just to look at some options, found myself at Jeep dealer, test drove a Grand Cherokee, and ultimatly couldnt come home without it! I bought a brand new 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee that day, and have been in love with it ever since.   It is everything i was looking for...sporty yet enough room for my family, groceries or whatever i decided to haul, tall enough to get in and out of without bending in half, reliable, and most of all comfortable.  Regardless of the reports on SUV's and their dangers, i have felt safer in my jeep than any other ride ive ever owned.  All in all i give it a big thumbs up for everyone......from teenagers, to parents, to grandparents!<br><br>
