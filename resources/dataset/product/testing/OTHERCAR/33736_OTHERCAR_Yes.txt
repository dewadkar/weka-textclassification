            Introduction

       I bought a fully loaded Dark Green 1995 Nissan Maxima SE with a manual transmission and Beige leather about one year ago with about 120,000 miles on it for $6000.00. I believe I can write a review now that I have about one year of experience with this car.


Exterior

      At first, the car looked uninspiring when I first bought it. What with its dark green color and tiny 15-inch rims. But it grew on me, and now I like the way the car looks with its conservative spoiler and large fog lights. I guess its a good thing that it looks the way it does, as it is virtually invisible to the cops. Me being 17 years old, in control of a powerful V6 with a stickshift, I tend to drive aggressively (not crazily). I have never gotten a ticket, nor have I ever been pulled over in my one year of driving. Plus, the girls don't complain about how it looks, so why would I?


Interior

         Talk about roomy. I am 6'1" and over 200 lbs. and I always feel comfortable. There is plenty of head room, even with the sunroof. And, the power driver seat even has lumbar support. The drivers seat is also 8-way adjustable, so you can find the perfect seating position. The passengers aren't left out either. In the back, there is more than enough leg and head room for two full-size adults. Three can fit pretty comfortably, but it can get pretty tight on long trips.
         At 75 mph, the car is pretty quiet, and you dont have to talk any louder to the person next to you, or turn the stereo up so you can hear the music. Speaking of music, the Bose system is pretty good,and it was fairly easy to use while driving, but it needed a little more bass. Plus, the Bose systems arent very reliable. Mine just stopped working one day. It kept burning out the fuse. And, whenever I put in a new one, it burned it out again as soon as I turned the power on. To find out what was wrong with it, and then fix the problem would cost me about the same as getting a brand new Pioneer sound system (head unit and four 3-way speakers) installed at Best Buy, which is a better system than the Bose anyways. So, be careful with that.
            But, I would like to congratulate Nissan for building such a good quality interior. The car has plenty of storage place, and a coin holder for quick access to change when going through a tollway. The car also has NO squeaks or rattles at its current 125,000 miles. The cup holders are in a pretty good place too. Only rarely did it ever bother me when shifting gears. I also like the black-on-white gauges, and the large trunk.


Performance

This is probably the most bitter-sweet of all the categories. Lets start with the sweet part. The Engine. Oh yeeaahh!!! The unbelievably powerful but  reliable and fuel efficient engine is like a dream come true. It is very smooth and rev-happy. How could something with only 190 hp move a car from 0-60 in only 6.7 seconds? Ive heard of cars in 2002 and 2003 doing that, but this car is from 1995. This is an engine ahead of its time. Maybe thats why it won so many awards. Wheelspin is just a toe-tap away, and this car can easily reach 100+ mph. And, even with all that power driving the front wheels, there is minimal torque steer. Speaking of steering, its another thing I love about this car. It has good feedback, and has a better-than-average turning radius for easy parking and maneuverability. Its also perfectly weighted. Its easy to turn at slow speeds, but doesnt get touchy at high speeds.
             Now for the bitter part. The handling in itself is not bad and it stays gripped to the road for the most part, but has too much body roll to be considered "sporty." I even tried putting a front strut tower brace, but that wasnt much of a help. And, when pushed to its limits, the car ultimately understeers. I'm sure this would be easy enough to fix. All you would have to do is add a Rear Sway Bar. As this makes the car corner flatter with less body roll, but you have to be careful not to set it too stiffly because you are not going to want to make your car too tail-happy. Adjust it to whatever you think you can handle so that you can increase your car's performance, but also be safe at the same time.            
              Another problem is the long-throw shifter, but you get used it over time. You can also fix this buy buying a short shifter kit. Plus, the clutch is very forgiving, and you appreciate that, especially in traffic, and in the city, as it doesn't give your left leg too much of a workout.
              One other problem is that the parts for this car are pretty expensive. Maximas are known to be reliable, but when something does happen, expect to pay a lot if not under a warranty of some sort. I had three sensors go out over the time that I've had the vehicle. All together they cost $800. The car has also had other problems, but that was due to the negligence of the owner before me, not the actual car itself.


Conclusion

         If you are in the market for a used, fast, reliable, roomy sport sedan, definitely consider the Nissan Maxima. All of its shortcomings can easily be fixed with relatively cheap aftermarket parts. It will be a great car that will last for a long time if taken care of.
