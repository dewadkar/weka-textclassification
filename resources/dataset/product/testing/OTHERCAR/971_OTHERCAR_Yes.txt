            Okay, first for the good news...the Ricoh RDC-4200 is an excellent camera for the price.  It takes excellent pictures, is easy to set up, and extremely easy to use.  It has an LCD display that lets you see pictures you have taken and delete ones that you don't like.  It's lens rotates around so that you may take pictures of yourself while seeing what the picture is going to look like.  It allows black and white as well as color photography, also macro and zoom.  
Now for the bad news, unless you use the AC adaptor (included), or rechargeable batteries, it will eat through lots of batteries!  Besides that one fact, I have found absolutely nothing wrong with this camera...and I have tried.  Enjoy.<br><br>
