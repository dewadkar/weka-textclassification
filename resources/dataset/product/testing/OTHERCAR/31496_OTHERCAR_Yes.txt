            We owned a 1987 Nissan Sentra Coupe that just kept on going, and going and going.  We paid $4,000 for it in 1991, with 37,000 and by the time it finally kicked the bucket last year it had 148K on it.  Until the last two months we owned the car we had no trouble with it. It never needed anything more than maintenance/wear and tear items. Even the original timing belt lasted over a hundred thousand miles. 

It got excellent gas mileage, 37-40 mpg, and it was surprisingly good in snow for such a little light car.  

The down side of this car was that it wasn't very roomy, although the hatchback version was useful to carry the occasional big item, and I liked the fact the seats were so easy to put down.  

If you find a Nissan Sentra with low mileage at a reasonable price and need good reliable transportation, this might be your car!
