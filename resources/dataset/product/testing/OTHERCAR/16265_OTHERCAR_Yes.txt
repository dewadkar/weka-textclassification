               Last year I decided I needed a new car. So I geared up: comfortable clothes, plenty of water and a list of car dealerships and last but not least, a good old sneakers to help me through the journey.
  After visiting all the nearby and not so nearby dealers I wound up at the Toyota and immediately fell in love with the Corolla 99 LE. Its sleek new lines and soft engine made made quite an impact.I was not expecting it to be so silent. But what I like more about a Toyota is how safe it is, dual air bags, side impact bars.To me, my safety and the safety of my passengers is very important. The new corolla 99 Le is an excellent choice if you want a cool-comfortable car that wont break your piggy bank.
  I have had the car now for two years now and so far no problems or funny surprises. Outside the normal check-ups and oil changes I have not had to bring the car in for anything.Not even tune-ups!
  Wether it be driving to an business meeting, on the way to close an important business deal or simply cruising with your friends on your way to the beach--sun roof open and music blasting; the Corolla 99 LE is an unbeatable choice!
