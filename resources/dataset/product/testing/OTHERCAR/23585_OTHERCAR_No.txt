            There has been so much talk about the new Lexus IS300, and it's about time to get a few facts straight. The inevitable comparison will be between it and the BMW 3-series, most likely the 325i (note that it's not called the 325 and not the 323 anymore). Both are very capable cars in their own right, but which reigns supreme? 

First let's take a look at the engine. The Lexus employs a very smooth L-6, displacing 3 liters. If any of you recall the late Supra, it's essentially the same engine with a little less horsepower. The Supra had 225 hp (in its last year, anyway) and the IS300 is down to 215. Most people out there can't tell the difference between 10 hp, but to the enthusiast 10 hp can make all the difference. With all the inherently lovable qualities an L-6 comes along with, this engine is hard not to like. It has the sweet melody of every inline 6 and has plenty of punch. However, it could use a little more. For a car that is supposed to be a sport sedan, 215 just isn't enough horsepower to push around 3500 worth of metal and image. 

It's a good relative comparison power-wise with the BMW, though. Although the BMW suffers from less displacement and less horsepower, its acceleration times are within .1 seconds of the IS300's 0-60 sprint of 7.2 and its quarter mile time of 15.6@90 mph. The BMW has a slight edge in the weight department, but the real benefit of the Bimmer is it's shorter gear ratios and the fact that it comes equipped with a 5-speed manual transmission. 

Which brings the next point: Lexus has to realize that the IS300 NEEDS a manual transmission if they are to be competitive with the sports sedans out there (BMW, Audi and even Volvo). The true enthusiast needs a clutch and a manual gear box in order to extract the full potential of the car. The slush box in the IS300 is no slouch, but it certainly will never be mistaken for a manual. The downshifts are quick and crisp--but there is still something to be said about shifting on your own. 

OK, so the Lexus and the BMW are just as fast as each other but what about handling? After all, that's what Bimmers are noted for. Car & Driver noted the M3 as the best-handling car over $30,000 only a few years ago (just as a note: The Honda Prelude was named the best-handling car *under* $30K), and the 3-series has had other car manufacturers playing catch-up to it for years. The IS300 is very competitive to the 325i, but it lacks the refined feeling of the BMW. In all practical applications, it can hang with the BMW on a track. It's slalom speed is actually .3 mph higher and pulls .1 more lateral G's, but this can be mainly attributed to its harsher ride and larger wheels. The driving dynamics of both cars are excellent, but the winner in the long run is the BMW. It offers the feel of the IS300, but has the comfort of a much larger car. In effect, it offers the best of both worlds: it's a sports can and a sedan. In addition, the driving dynamics of the BMW are a little superior to the IS300's, which would allow the BMW to have a slight edge on a race track. 

Where the IS300 seems to have an advantage is in styling. The 325i is classy, but easily forgettable. BMW's have always appeared sedate; the ultimate sleeper. The bold looks of the IS300 are welcome to any enthusiast. It's 17" wheels, aggressive tail and headlights, and low stance all position it as a much more intimidating car than the 325i. Inside the IS300, you're treated to one of the best-looking instrument clusters this side of the Pacific. The chrono-esque gauges are fun to watch as they light up with life when you accelerate. However, to anyone racing (who can only afford momentary glances down at the gauges) it isn't as usable as the 325i's well-placed instruments. They're big, easy to read and don't get in the way of anything. It's form and function, whereas the IS300 is form over function. 

It's hard to complain about the interior layout of either car. Both are inviting and very driver-oriented. The Lexus has been accused of being a bit cheap inside, though. 

In the end, the IS seems a great success for Lexus. It built a car strong enough to endure COUNTLESS comparisons with the 325i. As to whether it has come out ahead is another matter. For the younger generation more concerned with looking cool as they stroll down Rodeo Drive, the IS300 is the suitable car. However, for the enthusiast who enjoy a comfortable *and* well-balanced and well mannered car, the BMW is here for them. Unfortunately, a big factor which has led many from the IS300 is the fact that it only comes with an automatic transmission. Although Lexus is going to remedy this quickly, it may already be too late. Personally, I'd take the 325i over the IS300 simply to enjoy a car with a manual transmission. It is what completes the engine and chassis dynamics, and ultimately what links the car with the driver. 

Until the IS300 has a manual, I'll side with the BMW. But I'll keep my eye out for when Lexus finally throws a manual in the IS300.
