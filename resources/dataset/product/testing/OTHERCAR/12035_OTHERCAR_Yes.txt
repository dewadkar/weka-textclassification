            i didn't buy this vehicle but i own a 99 Honda Prelude and my dad owns a s2000. He owns the black color and man, its definitly a head turner. the first time i drove it i was amazed how sporty of a car it is and the looks of the electronic gauges was very cool. i definitly knew this was a chick magnet by the first look and feel of the car when i sat in it. 

The s2000 definitly has the sporty..lets go fast engine in it. it redlines at 9500rpms and kicks in all eight intake valves at around 5000 rpms, i believe. hence, the vtec engine valve timing electronic control. that means that at a certain point in the rpm band the ecu tells the engine to open up full throttle and you will feel a second kick when it hits that point and the engine will growl!!! Its kinda feels like a turbo but it hits more than a turbo. Honda does this for gas milage but still optimizes it for performance. its simply great engineering. this engine can uphold the beating of this sort since many years of engineering and technology has gone into this vtec engine. 

My first spin out with this car i came around a clover leaf...60mph.. and hit it in 2nd gear with a quick upshift into third and man it has tall gears and revs out great. it runs a 13.8 1/4 mile according to car and driver and i believe them. it threw me back in my seat pretty well but its very hard to race this car. it has oversteer which for most beginners is very hard to steer if racing. and the shifting is a bit touchy to drive fast since i had to hit every gear at redline to stay in the vtec powerband.

the handeling on this car is as amazing as its engine. i threw my dads car..he was with me... into corners like no tomorrow. it cuts and darts better than any bmw or mercedes i have driven. its like driving a vette just without the torque. it glides and moves swiftly while driving at 120mph with absolutely no steering wheel movements(shaking). The handeling is something you would have to expierence on your own!

the upholstry in this car is very unique and comftorable. it has lots of leg room and everything in the car was well thought out and well placed for the driver. it conforms around my body and the car urged for me to drive it. my dad spent a whole day driving around his car he loved it so much and still goes out and has fun with it. not to mention me asking if i could have my share of driving. 

mods on this car.
modding this car is very difficult because the great engineering. jackson racing will soon becoming out with a supercharger for this car which will add 30hp. there are minor mods like the aem cold air intake which makes horsepower and makes this car sound bad a??? my dad and I installed a aem cold air intake on it nad we both love it!! on my prelude i have intake header exhaust. these engines are built to with stand high columes of air and the engineering is incredable. they are easy, cheap, and fun to upgrade.

i would highly recommend buying this car. if you don't believe me go to your nearest honda dealer and find out for yourself.<br><br>
