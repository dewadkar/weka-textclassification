            In 1986, the Honda Motor Company released their new luxury line in the United States.  Since Honda was best known for economical smaller cars, they thought that US buyers might be wary of a larger luxury car with a Honda nameplate.  Thus, the Acura was introduced.  The flagship of this new nameplate was the Legend which sported features such as leather, a glass sunroof(quite uncommon back then), and an all-aluminum 24-valve V6 engine.  This "generation" of the Acura Legend continued until the 1990 model year, after which it was replaced by a more extravagant and powerful model.

My personal experience with the Acura Legend began last summer when I was searching for a used car for use during my senior year of college.  I had about $4000 to spend on a used car that would have to be reliable, aesthetically-pleasing, and practical.  My immediate preferences leaned toward 90-91 Honda Accords or Toyota Camrys, but since the quality of those models is universally known, it was hard to find decent models at my price range.  I then looked toward the 90-91 Acura Integra which although less practical still seemed like a fine choice.  Little did I realize that the answer to my prayers lay in the upscale model of the Acura nameplate.

While perusing listings for available Acura Integras, I noticed that many late 80's Acura Legends were available within my price range.  I was confused.  Wasn't the Legend supposed to be a "luxury" car?  I did a large amount of online research finding great resources such as www.legend.org that showed me how great a car an Acura Legend would be even if it was quite old.  I decided to test-drive a few of these vehicles and I bought the first one that I drove.

The Acura Legend is an amazing car, especially considering how old it is.  I test-drove a 1988 model that was two-tone white over gold.  I was amazed how good the car looked with what I thought would be a repulsive color combination.  The car had leather interior which looks very nice from the outside and is quite comfortable.  The car had a glass power sunroof which is great because so many sunroofs from the late eighties were metal.  The car is about the same size as most midsize sedans today and so the rear-seat head and leg room is more than enough for two six-footers.  There is much plastic and vinyl inside the car, but it is high-quality and it fits very well with the leather upholstery and door-lining.  Although the car is old, you definitely have the feeling that you are inside a quality piece of machinery.

When I actually started up and drove the car, I was amazed.  The car felt so much different from my mother's 4-cylinder Camry.  The steering is incredibly light - it is possible to make any turn with just one hand - yet there is plenty of road-feel transmitted through the wheel.  The result is that the car is incredibly fun to drive although it took me a while to get use to the surges of power from the single over-head cam 2.7 liter all-aluminum 24-valve V6, an engine that was more advanced when introduced in 1987 than many engines are today.  However, a minor imperfection in the valve-lifter design means that there is a slight clicking sound that emanates from the engine occasionally. 

As I often drive in an urban setting, I chose a model with the 4-speed automatic overdrive transmission.  This was quite a novelty in the late eighties when most cars only had a 3-speed automatic.  Some cars such as the Dodge Neon and Jeep Wrangler still only offer a 3-speed automatic today.  While the transmission shifts a bit rougher than modern automatics, the performance is better than almost every automatic car built in that decade including the V8 Chevrolet Camaros and Ford Thunderbirds and any 3-series BMW(based on Consumer Reports acceleration tests) as well as many "sports" cars with 5-speeds such as the Porsche 944.  The Acura Legend with the 5-speed manual transmission is much faster, competing with the best sports cars and sports sedans of the eighties.  However, the performance does come at a price as city gas-mileage is usually lower than 20mpg, often around 15-16mpg in heavy stop and go traffic. 

The car is equipped with 15-inch alloy wheels covered with 205/60 tires.  The wheels look very nice although, like all alloys, it is easy to scratch them while parallel parking.  The width of these tires is absolutely perfect for a car this size.  They allow good road-holding in emergency-handling situations, but they are not so wide that they damage the foul-weather traction.

Another feature that was ahead of its time is the anti-lock brakes.  These brakes stop the car very firmly when pushed hard, and they also allow plenty of modulation allowing great control when coming to a stop.  One minor issue with these brakes is that they are an early design, so they pulsate when pushed hard.  This may be slightly disconcerting to unexperienced drivers, but it is not a major issue.

The interior controls of the car are excellently designed.  All of the controls are very easy to use without taking your eyes of of the road.  The only control that requires heavy attention is the power-mirror control, but that should not be used while driving anyway.  The high-quality stereo with a 7-band equalizer has extra controls located by the right hand position on the steering wheel, this is a great feature because it allows you to change the channel or volume without removing your hands from the wheel.  The control for the sunroof is wisely placed by the left hand position of the steering wheel.  No controls are overly complicated easing the tension and adding to the fun of the driving experience.

The exterior, while well designed, is a source of a couple of the few problems with this vehicle.  While the Acura Legend has a distinctive look meaning that many people mistake it for a newer car, the looks are quite dated from certain angles.  Looking straight at the front or rear of the automobile makes it look like an eighties car.  The rear is very high and square, and the front is not quite stream-lined enough.  From practically any other angle however, the car looks sleek and aggressive with a distinctively sporty and Japanese shape.  Another minor problem is rust.  Any car this old will become rusty, and the Acura Legend is no exception.  Unless the car is garaged, or meticulously maintained, light rust spots will begin to line the wheel-wells.

The Acura Legend is a great overall car, but it turned out to be absolutely perfect for the needs of a college student. 

-First of all it was cheap to buy as I obtained mine for only $3500.  

-Second, the strong engine and sporty handling allowed me to have my "youthful" fun with it, peeling out and revving the engine high when the situation was appropriate. 

-Third, the car is relatively old, and the body is not perfect, so the tiny little dents that came from campus parking lots filled with some of the worst drivers in the country did not bother me too much. 

-Fourth, the large cargo space allowed me to fit tons of stuff for my trips to and from home, and the passenger spaced allowed me to seat 5 relatively comfortably, or 4 very comfortably on road trips.  

-Fifth, the leather, large sunroof, and general opulence of the car meant that I was not brought down to the "beater" social status among my snobby fellow students.  

-Finally, and most importantly, the car is amazingly reliable.  During a year of rough use in weather that included blistering heat and blizzard conditions, I spent LESS than $300 on unscheduled maintenance.  On total maintenance I don't think I spent more than $400.  I think that you would have a hard time finding a twelve-year old car with 150,000 miles that would perform so well and cheaply.

In conclusion, I highly recommend this car to practically anyone, especially a college student who would want a nice, sporty, reliable car but would not care too much about a slightly dated look or occasional funny (but harmless) engine noise.  If you can find an 86-90 (the 87-90 coupes, and 88-90 sedans have a slightly better engine) Acura Legend that has been well-maintained, I highly recommend that you purchase it!


PS: I do want to apologize for writing a review for an '88 instead of a '90, but the models are identical with the exception of a couple of tiny exterior changes and a slightly altered rear-suspension.  What I say for the '88 goes for the '90!!
