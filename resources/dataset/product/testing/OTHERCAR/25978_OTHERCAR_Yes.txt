            When I decided that I wanted to buy a new car, I started doing my homework. I knew I wanted a car that got good gas mileage, one that was a sedan or coupe, and one that would cost under $10,000 (including tax and tag) with my trade (which was worth $7,000). I searched through a myriad of cars, spending hours on the Internet reading everything to reviews to price guides.  After two weeks of researching, I decided on the Chevy Cavalier. Why? Because it's an incredible value! Did you know that it comes with ABS and a rear window defroster standard? On EVERY other car I looked at, ABS is not standard and can cost upward of $650 or more. I wanted a car that was cute and sporty and one that would not drive my insurance premiums through the roof. My new 2000 Cavalier is a great car at a great value. With their current $2000 rebate my car cost me $6K (after my trade). This included a tachometer, a spoiler, and a CD player. The seats were upgraded from previous models (even on the basic model) so they are really comfortable which was one of my bigger complaints in the '98 model. They lowered the seat too so there is plenty of headroom for those taller drivers out there. My three-year-old is very safe in his car seat because the new Cavalier includes three integrated harnesses to hold the car seat in place, which is more stable. The Cavalier's heavy frame makes you feel like you're really gripping the road, which for me, makes me feel safer.  If you're thinking about buying a new car, just test-drive the 2000 Cavalier, I think you'll be glad that you did. 

For the money, you cannot beat this car. Believe me, I've done the math!
