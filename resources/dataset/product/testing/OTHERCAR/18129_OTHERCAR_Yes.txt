            After 45,000 miles my 2000 Pontiac Grand Am GT was a great car, quick, no trouble, and stylish, but it became too small for my family of three. 

I wanted a 'Large American Performance Vehicle'. The wife vetoed the Marauder fantasy! The 300M had a small, ill shaped trunk opening, lackluster acceleration, and craftsmanship. At a local Pontiac / Toyota dealer, I was evaluating a Bonneville SSEi, and found cramped uncomfortable rear seating. After the Bonneville, the salesman sat me in an Avalon, nice but&#133 not for me. Next to the Avalon were the Highlander, and the Sienna. The Sienna is a mini-van. No mini-vans thank you. None of them offer me any driving pleasure. Mini-vans are practical, without a doubt, but boring.

To my surprise, really, I found myself in a Toyota Highlander. It&#146s not that Highlander&#146s styling caught my eye; I simply opened the door, to escape the hovering salesman, and sat in the back&#133 I needed a moment. After the moment I recalled my butt just sort of slid into the Highlander&#146s rear seat, so I stepped out and repeated the entry. Nice! The floor is flat! Nice interior! Good view! What&#146s in front?

...Although not &#145Buckets&#146, the front seats were comfortable, very comfortable. From the front seat the Highlander offered a smartly finished interior, well constructed, not luxurious, but &#133&#145Premium&#146. I was hooked the next day, the direct result of a test drive. Me in an SUV! I had to compare!

After Driving Honda&#146s Pilot, Mercury&#146s Mountaineer, Subaru&#146s Outback V-6, and Nissan&#146s Marano, I purchased a Bluestone Metallic 2003 Toyota Highlander Limited, with leather, sunroof, towing, skid control, and other &#145factory&#146 options. 

750 Miles, and a mini-road-trip into ownership, I&#146ll share the following impressions:

(*)Delivered with no flaws, or blemishes.
(*)Solid feeling body. No rattles from anything. I live in NYC&#146s pothole jungle.
(*)Smooth, silent, & pleasurable drive-train with ample highway passing and hill power.
(*)Pleasurable engine and door closing sounds.
(*)Not too big, not too small outside/inside dimensions.
(*)Excellent low speed control, handy in tight parallel parking, & parking lot situations.
(*)Excellent foul weather handling, including snow, wind & rain {Bad weather in NYC recently}.
(*)Excellent highway cruiser, seats long term comfortable, cabin silent.
(*)Gas mileage close to EPA&#146s estimate. I&#146m getting 17.5 MPG city 21.6 MPG highway.
(*)Spacious seating front and rear, with well placed armrests for all.
(*)Great View. Few, if any blind spots. Good mirrors.
(*)Flat floors, front, rear and cargo areas.
(*)Rear seats recline.

(-)Ivory interior hard to keep clean.
(-)No change holder.
(-)Center console storage, cup-holders, & ashtray awkwardly arranged.
(-)Wind rush at highway speeds with any open window, and or sunroof.
(-)No power passenger seat adjustments & too few manual seating adjustments.
(-)No memory settings for power driver&#146s seat, and or mirrors.
(-)No shelf for cargo area.
(-)Rear seats are stationary; they should slide forward/rearward.

***12-25-02 Update***

After 900 Miles:
 
(*) Each time I look at the Highlander, its exterior styling becomes less awkward; Its lines & curves grow more cohesive & attractive each with each study.
(*) Flat floors really add to the comfort & utility the available seating room. It amazes me how that changes everything I might have thought about seating area. 
(*) The Highlander&#146s drive-train silence, power, & ride smoothness are endearing. As if libations, they&#146ve seduced me, slowly, measurably, every time I&#146ve driven.

My dislikes, mentioned previously, above, remain; However, allow me to close this review with the following:

I'm 42 now, & didn't purchase this vehicle to be a dream car, just a practical one. If the ownership experience with the Highlander continues at the same cadence, you will find it in my driveway when you visit me for my 60th birthday.

My Next Update: 

...Is happening sooner than expected, due to a note from Shelley5. Most of my reply to Shelley5:

4,000 miles into ownership & NYC hasn&#146t produced a rattle in this vehicle yet.

Other Observations:

An auto-locking door feature, when the car exceeds 5 MPH, like in my former GM would be nice as I forget to lock the doors sometimes.

The center console has both grown on me and to annoy me. What appeared to be a convenient place to store stuff, in the center void underneath the console, is just a dirt trap, so you are not inclined to put nice things there, and stuff you do put there just slides and rattles around, at times breaking free. Useless. The upper storage places have seemed to work out much better than expected. Same for the cup holders. Question for ya? Have you used the sunglasses holder on the ceiling? And what is that trap door for on the left of the dash, to the left of the steering wheel for?

There is lots of room under the rear seat. Found a storage bin that fits underneath. All my care stuff fits there.

I'm still trying to figure out a better way to utilize the storage space in the rear of the vehicle. If you put stuff on the floor it slides. Not enough bag holders/hooks. A shelf would be nice.

The power-train is still very seductive. Smooth, refined, & silent. Love it. Averaging 16/17 MPG city, NYC, 23/24 MPG highway; 19/20 MPG normally, overall from a tank of gas, 16.5/17.5 MPG overall from a tank of gas during bad weather, grid-lock, or car-pools.

I still feel this truck is dam near perfect. If it weren't for the recent turn of events in the world I'd purchase another. Due to the rise in gas prices, and our vehicles premium gas appetite, maybe an RAV-4, or Corolla would be wiser. So for now I wait, as I enjoy &#133really enjoy my recently purchased Highlander.
