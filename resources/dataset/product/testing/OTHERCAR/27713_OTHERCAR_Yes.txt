            I bought a red 1996 Eclipse almost 3 years ago and I have loved it ever since.  I'm a 42 year old career-oriented woman and I'm reliving my teenage years with this dream car.  Mine is bright red and has grey interior.  It's the GS model also.  I am constantly getting compliments on how pretty it is because I keep it immaculate.  I would recommend this car to anyone who not only wants a fashionable ride but enjoys the &quot;experience&quot; this little car gives. Definitely a &quot;Baby Boomers&quot; dream car.  Holds the road like no other car I've driven and is fast on take-off.  Equipped with a cd player which is very nice. I bought my Eclipse for my personal use but my husband does enjoy buzzing around in it. The only thing left to say is...&quot;Go get you one&quot; and I'll see you on the road.<br><br>
