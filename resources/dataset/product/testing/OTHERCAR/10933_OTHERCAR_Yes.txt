            I'm writing this in order to express my experience with my 2000 BMW 323 Sedan. To be short: I still love the car, but it had a minor mechanical problem.

Positives first:

BMW's smart automatic transmission learned (as promised) to upshift only at redline, when I push the pedal to the metal. I don't use "Sports Mode" in the transmission at all. In fact, I think it's a little annoying when in this mode it wouldn't upshift under 4,000 RPM or so. I don't use "Clutchless shifting" either. This clutchless thing could be useful somewhere up North, with all the bad weather and everything, but not here in Florida :) But the best thing I like about BMW's transmission is the way they designed a shifter. In order to put a car into Drive you only need to pull it way back - that's it! You can't miss, it's super convenient comparing to all those funky gated shifters. It also looks like a manual shifter (gates are wrapped in a leather bag).

I love the engine too. Sounds like a turbine in a small jet, pulls hard. No vibrations at neither idle, nor high RPM. Acceleration is very good, plenty of passing power.

I'm _very_ sensitive to even minor rattles or squeaks in a car. One tiny little rattle in my previous car became a major annoyance factor for me. No rattles in this one. Dead quiet. Excellent.

The seats and the steering column are very adjustable. I have very long legs but even I can fit in there comfortably. Initially I wanted a car without sunroof (because it costs money and takes a inch off the  headroom :), but I settled with the car that had one. I still have plenty of space between my head and the roof (about an inch-and-a-half).

Now, one bad thing... My front left window opener broke. Actually, it was working, but it was making a noise. The problem was fixed in an hour, but I had to wait for an appointment for two weeks (I guess it's not too long :)
