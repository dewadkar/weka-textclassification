            <b>Camera Body</b>
<p>This is a very lightweight camera.  It has a small screen but it is big enough to view the picture before taking it.  
<p><b>Functionality</b>
<p>The camera is very easy to use.  Just turn it on and press the button.  Scrolling through the pictures takes a little bit of getting used to.  When scrolling through the pictures, if you select one, it is hard to get back to the original menu.  Aside from that the functionality is fairly intuitive.
<p><b>Picture Quality</b>
<p>This is a 4  MegaPixel camera so the pictures are very clear and of high quality.  Every once in a while they turn up dark depending on the lighting.  I was not able to determine what type of lighting made this happen.  I was indoors with bright lights and they came out dark.  Another time I was indoor with dark lights and they came out fine.  The 2 minute movies are of very high quality and I would recommend this camera for that functionality.
<p><b>Memory</b>
<p>If this camera has one downfall it is the memory that it comes with.  The memory card only holds about 15 pictures at a time.  So you definitely need to buy a memory upgrade, probably to the 128 MB size.
