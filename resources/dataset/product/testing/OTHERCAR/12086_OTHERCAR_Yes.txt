            This car is fun to drive.It has the best steering radius of any 4wheeldrive I have owned.And that's a lot.I like the 6cyl.engine and that is what made me chose this car over the other small suvs.They all had 4.The only small problems I found is the radio antenna is mounted almost horizontally on the roof and the reception suffers for it.It also has the least amount of interior space of all its competition.I love that the headlights come on automatically when it gets dark and go off when you stop the engine.I strongly recommend this car to anyone.   


     After writing  this opinion the trans started to slip. I know 1 other person who has one. Same thing happened to her.
     We both have appointments to get them fixed.But the other person said when she called they went out and checked other new cars and they all seem to have this problem.I still feel its a great car but I would find out more about this if I were looking to buy.         <br><br>
