            This is one powerful yet luxurious machine.  It's almost comparable to a Cadillac.  The impala is a mix between Chevy's Lumina and a more luxurious sedan.  The impala has a standard V6 engine in it and comes with full power on the basic car.  The LX offers a lot of great features that are typically found in foreign cars like Volvo's and BMW's.  The radio itself is amazing.   The radio is almost self programing, and all you have to do is hit one button to scan a specific type of music.  
The safety features of the Impala are also an added incentive to buy this vehicle.  The engine is on a suspension system and in the case of a wreck, will actually drop to the ground so that it will not be compacted into the driver and passenger.  Also offered are: side impact beams, fire blankets on the inside of the hood, automatic locks after the car is shifted in to gear, among many other features.  This is a great car for the price.  A fully loaded Impala would cost around $23,000- $25,000.  <br><br>
