            I bought an Ephoto 780c for x-mas with extra memory and rechargeable batteries. It was an excellent and cost me around $250.00 total. This was substantially less than the next level of camera. I am quite pleased with the pictures clarity and definition and the camera is simple to use, lightweight, and basically does everything as advertised.

However let me educate you on some of the downfalls. The camera comes with the ephoto software package. This package allows the user to load pictures into their pc and then save/e-mail/etc. The transition time from the camera to the pc is absolutely horrendous. Let me paraphrase that by saying I own a top of the line extremely fast pc so it was not my connection. Also this process pretty much kills your camera batteries so it is imperative that you buy either rechargeables and the recharger and/or the optional ac adapter. You can speed the process up by buying this separate attachment that allows your to go straight from the memory chip into your computer and thereby not using your cameras batteries. However for this camera this also requires a flash reader device. Once installed it works fairly quickly and easily. Unfortunately you need to spend another $250 to $300 to get all this. This really negates the cost savings of this camera.

Overall I still love the pictures and the quality and with the extra devices my load time is much quicker. However I spent more than double than what I originally expected.<br><br>
