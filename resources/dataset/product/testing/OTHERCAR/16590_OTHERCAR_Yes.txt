            I was in the market for a simple point and shoot digital camera for under 300 dollars.  It came down to the cannon A20, the Nikon Coolpix 775, and the Sony P50.  I was undecided till a friend of mine let me use his Sony and it has been love ever since.

The first thing you notice about the camera is that it is very comfortable to hold and the controls are placed where they are easy to get at.  The five way button requires some getting used to, but once you do it makes navigating the  menu a breeze.  It did not take long at all before I figured out how too use all of the features and was out shooting pictures.

The still image quality on the camera has impressed me greatly, it captures well exposed and very detailed photos.
The camera's auto focus works well and the automatic white balance keeps the color balance perfect.  The camera has an amazing macro mode that lets you focus on objects as close as 1.2 inches.  The video mode on the camera will let you captures silent video (motion JPEG) at 160x112 and 320 by 240 until the memory card is used up.

That brings up the next topic: memory.  Sony includes a 4mb memory card with the camera which is just about useless.  The 4mb card will store 3 pictures at high resolution.  Luckily Sony has recently dropped the price on memory stick media and with the 20 online gift card that came with my camera I was able to by a 64 mb card from Sony for $40.
It makes a world of difference, I can store 66 photos at high resolution, 166 at medium resolution, and almost 12 minutes of video.

The other complaint was battery life.  With standard AAs expect 8 minutes.  Sony sells an excellent rechargeable battery, but it cost $60.  I didn't want to pay that much so I went down to radio shack and for $20 dollars I got 4 NiMH (1500mah) and a great little charger.  Now I can shoot for at least 45 minutes with the LCD on.

Once you put the extra 60 dollars into this camera it becomes a lot more fun.  I take mine every where with me and the camera has held up very well.  It has an excellent  quality feel to it and feels very well made.  The main point is what ever camera you by try it first too see if you like it because everybody has different preferences.
All said and done though the Sony P50 has been the most fun $330 dollar investment I have made in a long time
