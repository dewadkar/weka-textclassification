            	Put simply, the Mercedes-Benz S 500 is the best sedan you can buy for less than $100,000. This car is elegantly styled both inside and out. Firstly, it is a luxury car--with everything from the programmable seat positions to cigar ashtrays in the rear to a beautiful Bose audio system, I would not at all mind living in this Benz, never mind driving it!

	This is not just a luxury car, however. Powered by a 300+ hp 5-Liter V8, this car will really go when you want it to. Even at 6,000 rpm, though, the engine can barely be heard within the tranquil sanctity of this sedan. With tight handling, wonderful suspension (tight but smooth), incredible safety features, and one of the best-engineered motors available, this car is worth every penny, and I highly recommend it to anyone who can afford it!<br><br>
