              I bought this truck about 5 months ago and I have nothing but good things to say about it. I have enjoyed everything from the smooth ride to the powerful drive train to the comfortable interior.
 
  I recently got back from a 2 thousand mile road trip and expected to have cramped joints and a stiff back by the time I got to my destination. To my surprise I didn't have either. It drove as well as my previously owned Civic, which you may already know, is a great ride. Once I got there I put it to the real test, off road where it belongs. I went through intimidating mud holes and what seemed to be straight up the face of a mountain. So for those who don't realize, the Chevrolet comercials on TV don't lie. Coming back I hauled a small trailer with a dining room and bedroom set. 

 Although it was a heavy load for the size of the truck, it handled it like it had a V-8. I was very impressed and would recomend this truck to anyone.  <br><br>
