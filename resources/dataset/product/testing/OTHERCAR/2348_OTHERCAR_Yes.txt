            This camera does a good job at taking pictures, and is pretty easy to use (even for me, and I'm not particularly computer literate).  however, it has a couple of basic design issues.  first, and most irritating, is disconnecting the wire that runs from the camera to the computer.  if your fingers are any bigger than tiny, you're going to have a heck of a time pushing the disconnect button while pulling the wire out.  in fact, the door that covers the slot almost has to be broken off to get your fingers in there. also, the zoom is only 2 stages (ie: zoom or no zoom, no continuous option).  also, the software provided to process the pictures has virtually no edit options.  it's easy to use, but so is my much older product (i don't know if i can say the name here) and the older one has MANY more options. bottom line, i got this camera on sale for $400, and it is a good deal.  handle carefully, and use other editing software. have fun.    <br><br>
