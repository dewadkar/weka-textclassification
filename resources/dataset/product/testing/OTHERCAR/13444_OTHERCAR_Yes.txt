            My Blazer has a few personality quirks.  And the two of us got off to a really bad start, but over time I've learned to depend on my Blazer.  And most importantly trust it.  I bought my Blazer used, and within the first two weeks the key got stuck into the ignition and I couldn't get the truck to turn off, and the gas gauge was wrong so I was stranded on the side of the freeway for about 20 mins.  Despite all of this, I wouldn't have any other car.  

I've had it for over a year and I haven't had any other problems besides what I've mentioned above.  With SUV prices skyrocketing, it was a great choice for my budget. 

A couple of other personality quirks that don't bother me, but could drive others insane.  The back window squeak while you drive.  Sometimes louder than other times.   The windsheild wipers are possessed.  Every once in awhile they'll turn on then directly off.  Both of these things happen in my sister's '89 GMC Jimmy too.  So, I know it's not just that my Blazer is weird.  

I would recommend this vehicle for anyone who is looking for an affordable, reliable, SUV.<br><br>
