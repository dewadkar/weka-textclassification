            ECHO is a sound heard when it is reflected back to its source after striking some object. I relate the same to my 'ECHO car 2000' The sound is my vehicle, the source is me and the object is my money. It is usually assumed that a car is something, which takes you from point A to point B. Yes, the assumption is right, but not fully. The way in which you have reached from point A to point B is important. In this case, leave aside other cars; let me tell you how I met my Echo and how it takes me from point A to point B.

My plane from India landed on the soil of USA. I got myself settled and notice that I am having a problem of commuting. I decided to purchase a car for my ease. I had certain criteria about my purchase-budget, preference for a new car, status depiction, durability, engine, speed and above all fuel economy. ECHO was not even in my remotest thought. I personally visited the car showrooms of Hyundai and Honda. I took a test drive, compared the two and decided for Hyundai to fit my tight budget. On my way back I stopped at the Toyota show room to get my way back home which I had lost. Just as I was outside the outlet I was spell bound by a beauty .No not by any magical black beauty but by a white beauty. It was sleek, sexy, and attractive, it excited me and it drove me crazy. It was as new and fresh as a virgin-untouched, unrevealed. For me it was love at first sight. I went near it, saw it from front and back and it looked wonderful. I went into the shop and I was guided by a decent salesman about the white beauty. I took a test drive and saw it features-one of the unique was its tachometer. Placed differently to be noticed by one and all. And why not, it's the difference that is always noticed. Also I was happy that the power of this vehicle was as powerful as a Honda civic and much more than a Hyundai accent. I extended my budget a bit to get my hands on my love. And that day is my remembrance. I had it all. Today it has driven me 2500 miles. I reach from pt A to pt B in a smooth way. ECHO is not just a car; it's a wonderful car. It's got 'the looks' that makes all eyes envious. Its smooth to drive, its fun for a race, its perfect for an evening romantic drive with my wife, its ideal for a picnic to stuff myself and family and all other bags. However, I wonder that when my car is perfect, as I know why does it shake up in winds and by swift passing of other cars. Hope its not betraying me.
Today when I look back I fell I have entered into a wonderful deal. A deal one should go for.
