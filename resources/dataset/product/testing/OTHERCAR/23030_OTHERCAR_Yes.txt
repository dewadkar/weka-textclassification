            I was searching for a digital camera to be able to use with my model horse hobby.  I happened to find the PDC-640 at Walmart at the price of $178.00.  Too nice a price to pass up, I purchased one and took it home.  The camera itself is extremely easy to use and takes very nice pictures.  Problems I have found are, even with the flash, you need a lot of light to take indoor pictures.  No zoom feature on this camera makes taking pictures of tiny objects, such as 3 inch model horses, difficult.  All in all, though, I have been fairly happy with this camera and would recommend it to anyone wanting a digital camera.<br><br>
