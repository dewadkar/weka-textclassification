            The S1 is a great camera. I run a sports web site and take action photos with it all the time, but also use it personally for everything from landscapes to portraits to hauling it around when Im on vacation to shooting my dog in the yard.  I tested all the main competitors and I didnt see any appreciable difference in photo quality from the higher-end models to justify the $1500+ price difference between them and the S-1. For me, its not about spending money. Its about what comes out on the other end after everything is said and done. Despite a few features it doesnt have, your audience will never know you took the photos with the S-1 and saved yourself a lot of money. To me, thats what its all about.

Its true, the S-1 isnt built like a tank, but Im also a part-time journalist and its always been my belief that when you shell out over $1000 for any electronics equipment, you ought to treat it like your own child, whether its a camera or a DVD player. If you take care of things like you should and arent one of those who abuses items w/o cause, the S-1s construction is a non-entity. My camera has been everywhere and still looks like I just took it out of the box -- but then again all my camera equip. does b/c thats how I think a true photographer should take pride in it.

In any case, the Fuji takes exceptional action photos. The downside of course is the lack of a quick 4-5 frame-per-second shutter, but the 1.5FPS is MORE THAN ADEQUATE if you are a sports nut and actually know a little about the game and anticipate the play. For me, I can see my photo before I even press the shutter so theres no need to rip off 4-5 pics a second. It would be nice sure, but not something Id pay $1500 for. The autofocus isnt quite as fast as some either, but again, if you pay attention its not a big thing.

The best part of the camera is that its always ready to take photos. No matter where you are on the menus, all you have to do is pull the trigger and whammo, you've missed nothing. This a great feature b/c I tool around on my menus a lot but if I see the action in a sporting event heating up, I just raise it to my eye real fast and Im right on top of things immediately w/o downtime. Also, Ive heard some people say that the menus and multiple displays are unintuitive. While it does take a few days to get used to, I actually like the Fujis interface better than any others.  Things are easy to find and straightforward.

The S-1 doesnt have quite the number of bells and whistles of the other cameras, but for its price, its the winner hands down. Its not even close in my opinion. Though im a pretty serious photographer, its not how much you spend, its how you spend it. With the money left over I upgraded to a new printer, added a 1GB microdrive, and Im good to go. Plus, all my Nikon lenses (ok most of them) are completely compatible, so one lens will give me film and digital capabilities. Id recommened the 1GB microdrive. Its a warehouse on the go.

I also see the multiple battery "bins" as a total advantage. While youve got to keep track of them and how much life is left, it gives the Fuji superior longevity in the field and you can whip off 200-300 photos w/worrying about losing power.  For me, Id rather stick a few more batteries in the thing before I leave home and know its going to last a long time, then have to recharge or pop new ones in after every 10 photos. A spare set is always a good idea, but I rarely need em.

The only real beef w/the camera is the 6.1 megapixel claim. Its not true 6.1 and uses a bit of trickery to accomplish it (no sense in explaining all that gobbledygook). If you set the camera to shoot in true 3 megapixel you are getting the same quality as the supposedly 6.1 after you crop and reduce to the size of the 3.  So I just shoot in the 3 range and save space on the Microdrive.  The highest setting will yield 15MB photos and who needs those. If you know all this going in and convince yourself that you are getting a great camera in the 3-3.5 megapixel range, which is where most of the competition is anyway in the digital SLR arena (at least this week), then you wont be disappointed at all.

If you simply have money to burn, there are other options, and although I could afford the others, I like knowing Im getting more for less.  The S-1 gives you a great camera and money left over to do those other things in your photo world youve been putting off. The only people I cant see this camera for is if you are employed by Sports Illustrated and command a camera that will win you a cover photo or get you fired. In that case, the 4-5FPS may be something you cant part with. But to that I say, learn more about the sport you are covering and the photos will "find you" rather than you always having to find the photo. 

The Fuji will surprise you and if you own a Nikon 35mm with a bunch of cash dumped into Nikon mount lenses, why not put them to use in more than one place.
