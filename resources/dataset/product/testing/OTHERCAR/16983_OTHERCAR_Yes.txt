            The Pontiac Montana is a excellent handling vehicle. This vehicle performs well on long trips. Vehicle has the capacity for up to seven passengers. The seats are for average sized adults with ample leg room. Vehicle came with a power assist door on the passenger side allowing ease of loading and unloading items from the passenger area.

This model has a 3.4 liter V6 motor that performs very well in and out of traffic. I did notice on a trip to the mountains that the engine temperature did raise considerably on inclines. I had to turn off the the air conditioning to reduce engine temperature during constant inclines of periods longer than 20 minutes.

The sets are removable and allow for different configurations, however, the seats are tough to remove. The locking bars require quite a bit of pressure to disengage the lock to remove the seat. You can easily carry groceries and other items with seat reconfiguration.

Vehicle maintenance has been good. One of the problems has been with checking the battery water. The battery sits directly below the fuse box. You must remove the bolt holding the fuse box to move the fuse box out of the way to get to the battery. Oil changes are easy to handle, but recommend that you stay on a regular maintenance for oil changes as the countdown indicator will cause you to change the oil later than you should.
