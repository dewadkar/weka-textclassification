                Simply put, the 1999 Infiniti G20 4 door sedan is the best car I've ever owned. The positives:  Its handling is superb: tight and responsive.  When you want to pass another vehicle, it surges so fast, you actually get a rush of adrenaline. The "Leather & Convenience" package option is definately worth the $1,124.00 we paid for it (MSRP is $1,500.00). It includes  leather interior (seats, interior door panels, steering wheel/shift knob), power moonroof, 4-way power driver seat, auto temperature climate control, HomeLink Universal Transceiver which opens your garage door when programed.)  The doors feel substantial and solid. The trunk illuminates when opened and has a great area (about 3 feet across) in the back which opens when the back seats fold down to allow long items to have access (very handy!). The AM/FM CD player has a powerful 6 speaker, 100 watt sound system with adjustable audio controls for bass, treble, and balance. There is a neat mirror on the passenger side visor which lights up when flipped open and there are great overhead map lights as well. 
    The negatives: When making u-turns, the turning ratio is too wide. For its size, the car should be making much tighter turns. The interior doorlocks on driver side door panel are virtually impossible to see at night without turning on the overhead lights. There is a small open storage vestibule on the dash inbetween the seats and below the radio which is way too shallow.  If you floor the gas pedal to pass another car, all of the contents inside the open vestibule slides right out.  The seats are very comfortable, however, if you have chronic lower back problems, you may want to place a lumbar support cushion against the seat.
