            I was initially attracted to the Mazda6 by its Acura-like youthful and sporty style and quality looking fit and finish.  After having test driven the Honda Acccord, Toyota Camry, VW Passat, Nissan Altima, Nissan Maxima, and Subaru Outback, I was impressed with the Mazda6's overall competence and value.  My wife particularly liked the appearance and was persuasive in making this the finalist as her new car.  So we traded in her '96 Camry and brought home a Steel Gray Metallic Mazda6.

Only a week after choosing the Mazda6, my wife began to notice that the performance was not as solid as she had thought during the test drive.  She noticed that the handling was vague and the steering was too light due to over-assisted power.  The brakes were unsteady and there was too much fade during long braking.  The seats were also too hard and uncomfortable.  There is a glare from the metallic center console surface during the day and the power accessory access is poorly designed.  The rear seats don't fold nearly flat enough to be effective.  The rear head restraints are useless.  And most of all the 160 horsepower 2.3 liter engine feels more like a 140 hp when encountering even a slightest hill or a couple of passengers are added.  The engine gets noisy and has to be pushed hard to get the job done.  

My wife and I think we were detered by the ubiquitous, perhaps even unattractive, look of the Accord and foolishly decided on this mediocre car.  We both are very regretful.
