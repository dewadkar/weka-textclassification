            We purchased this vehicle to accommodate the changes that were occurring with our family, the kids were growing, our parents and grandparents were aging, and we needed some cargo room to boot.  We purchased our van brand new in December 1995 and we still own it.

We enjoy the extra length with this vehicle and the sliding passenger door.  It was really fun to spook the grocery boys with the automatic remote opener when we first got this model.  I was also pleased with the built-in child seats in the back, along with the automatic door locks that lock as soon as the car is put into gear.

The drawbacks to this model are as follows:
The seats are uncomfortable on long trips.  I haven't figured out why exactly, but they feel rather hard after awhile.  In fact, we had to replace the passenger seat in the front because it bent and tilted forward.  We were told it was a manufacturer's defect.  This model is basically on a truck chassis, therefore, you do not get the small car handling of some of the other minivans on the market, but that has not bothered us.

We had many problems with the windshield wipers, initially.  The wipers would stop in the middle of a driving rainstorm, or not even come on at all.  I was driving the car with my daughter and we were on the interstate headed to North Texas when this happened.  I pulled into a Dealer's Repair Station to learn that the nearest wiper motor was in Austin, some 45 miles up the road and the cost was to be over $300!  The rain let up, and I was able to get this repaired at a local auto parts store for less than $200.  They even had the part in stock.  

Another review on this vehicle mentions the rattling that happens, and we must agree, the console rattles terribly.  We took it in several times to be tightened and we've finally given up.

Overall, this van has not been problematic.  We did start noticing at 89,000 miles that the gas gauge and speedometer are not as reliable as they were when they were new.  The van drives about 7 miles over the mph registered on the dash, consistently.

The engine has been a good performer, but as we just learned, when it decides to go out, it does!  The engine light did not come on, nor did the temperature light, but we noticed that the engine was hot.  We stopped immediately and allowed it to cool off.  We did not find any source of water leak.  The hoses were good, the belts were good, radiator, etc.  Unfortunately, the V6 Engine on this particular model is notorious for having the gasket/seals go out, causing water to mix with the oil, and the engine overheats.  The engine for this car is no longer made and must be factory built if it needs replacing, unless you can luck out on finding a used one.  (I wonder why...)  On the plus side, this engine does not have a timing belt, just gears, so that's one less thing to worry about.

I have not mentioned the dent-proof body.  It really is dent-proof and our car has continued to look good all of these years.  

Our van has over 124,000 miles on it and it has been a good vehicle.  We were just disappointed to learn that this particular engine has this tendency to have the gaskets blow and burn up your engine.  At the dealership we saw two melted down engines.  Ours was not one of them, but it was shot, nonetheless.

We hope to get about 40,000 miles out of this used engine and then go into a smaller car as once again our family needs will have changed.  If you are considering purchasing a used model, or you have one with less miles on it already, just beware of some possible problems in the future.<br><br>
