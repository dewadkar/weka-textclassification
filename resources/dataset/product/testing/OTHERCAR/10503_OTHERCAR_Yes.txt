            <b>FIRST IMPRESSION:</b>
This car looks pretty small for a luxury sedan. Don't let the size fool you, though. It's not sluggish in any way, shape, or form. With 225 horses under the hood, this sedan means business. The first time I saw the TL was at night. I was pulling out of the shopping mall and I saw this blue-ish light coming towards me. I quickly turned to see it as it brushed by me... it was badged with an Acura symbol and I quickly assessed it to be the <b>Acura 3.2 TL</b>.

<b>THE WALK-AROUND:</b>
Shortly after, I had to go see this car for myself. Fortunately, one of my friends bought one and I had the honor of driving it. At first, you notice that the car looks very solid. The TL has a wide stance and also looks very low to the ground. The 16&quot; alloys are dressed with 205/60 Michelins and the four disc brakes are well-suited for stopping on a dime. When opening and closing the doors, they feel very solid. The leather seating and trim is to die for. The rear seats are well-appointed and very comfortable. On long trips, you'd probably want adjustable head rests, but that's besides the point. The front seats are nice and can be controlled to the exact position with the power adjustments. The driver's seat positions you perfectly for the road. The instrument cluster is well designed and allows the driver to focus on the road while paying minimal attention to the dials. I especially liked the steering wheel with the controls for the stereo. I've seen older Pontiacs with millions of buttons on their steering wheel, but Acura does not drown out function over style. The TL's steering wheel is leather wrapped and has a very thick feel. The <b>Bose stereo</b> is loaded with features, a tape and CD player to be exact. The speakers are wonderful and the smooth ride just adds to the joy. The climate control works well (AC is very cold and the heat flows freely). 

<b>PERFORMANCE:</b>
Wow. For a sedan, this unit really packs a punch. My friend was driving and we came to a stop at a light. We were next to a brand new BMW 328 and it seemed like they wanted to race (two teenagers driving their mom's new ride). Being that we were in an area where cars were nowhere to be seen, the two drivers glanced at each other, the light turned green, and I was holding on to the seat of my pants! I looked over and saw that we were traveling at 70 MPH in no time. I slowly saw the Beamer fading away in the distance. We cooked 'em good. The sound of the <b>VTEC engine</b> was music to our ears. The <b>5-speed automatic sequential sport shifter</b> is nice. Not quite the same feel as a real manual transmission car, but I like it. I think if we raced a few blocks more, we would've run out of gas... we were actually on our way to fill up the TL (it was running on fumes at the time). The TL is quite tame around corners. The tires screech for traction and the suspension keeps it from excessively rolling. The engineers at Acura did their homework.

<b>STANDARD FEATURES:</b>
The Acura TL comes with virtually everything as standard except for the spoiler and the navigation system (which you can really live without):

- 3.2 liter, SOHC 24-valve, V6 VTEC Engine

<b>Options:</b> Acura Satellite-linked Navigation System, CD changer, Floor mats <i>(oooh...this bugs me!)</i>, Real wood shift knobs, and Rear spoiler

<b>FUEL ECONOMY:</b>
The TL has a 17.2 gallon fuel tank and the fuel economy is ranked at <b>19 MPG in the city</b> and <b>29 MPG on the highway</b>. Pretty impressive figures for a sedan that pumps out <b>225 horses</b>. 

<b>WARRANTY:</b>
The Acura warranty is fairly good. The TL comes with an impressive <b>4-year/50,000 mile</b> bumper-to-bumper warranty, along with <b>5-year/unlimited miles</b> rust/corrosion warranty. Their service is quite good and you can expect them to go above and beyond the call of duty on many occasions. 

<b>SUMMARY:</b>
The 2000 Acura TL is worth the money. It combines the practicality of a family sedan with the performance of a sports car and the features of a luxury-class automobile. This is one sedan no one can refuse to buy for <b>under $30,000</b>. It's hard to find a family sedan that incorporates so many luxury features as standard. Take my word for it and take it for a spin. You'll regret you did because you'll want one really soon...  <br><br>
