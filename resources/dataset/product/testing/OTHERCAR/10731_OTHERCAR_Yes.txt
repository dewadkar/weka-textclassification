            The race to build the best midsize SUV is well under way and some clear front runners are emerging.  The new supercharged Nissan Xterra, the Hyundai Santa Fe, and the Mazda Tribute/ Ford Escape  are by far the best in their class.  Two years ago, many would have put money on Honda to build the best small SUV.  After all, they build the best minivan, midsize sedan and the best compact car, who wouldn�t want what Honda has to offer?  Frankly the CRV is a disappointment.  It is underpowered and lacks the refinement found in virtually every other Honda product.  This is in  no way is meant to bash Honda, it is, in fact, a testament to how great they are.  The only way to reasonably recommend a particular kind of car, is to first explain why the Honda version isn�t the best.  For example, if I wanted to claim the Oldsmobile Intrigue was the best midsize sedan (it�s just an example), no one in their right mind would listen unless I first convinced them why it is better than the Honda Accord.  That speaks very highly for Honda.

With Honda stuck on the sidelines in the SUV battle, the field is wide open.  Mazda�s entry is basically a twin to the Ford Escape, however there are some differences.  The Mazda is a little sportier, with tighter suspension designed for on-road zip rather than off-road adventuring. First impressions only strengthen the comparison between the Santa Fe and Xterra.  There is a lot of room in these little trucks, and the Tribute will easily haul 4 adults and plenty of stuff.  

The Tribute�s interior is keeping with the sporty theme (zoom zoom zoom and all). Full gauges including a tachometer are nearly identical to the Escape�s.  Seats are comfortable and supportive.  Although firm at first, an extended road trip proved the seats to be very comfortable.  The center armrest/storage bin is useful, and other smaller but well placed storage areas are plentiful up front.  If you are a big fan of sunroofs, you�ll love the one Mazda puts on the Tribute. In a word it is BIG.  The big and wide sunroof seems to be nearly as large the one found on the much larger Chevy Tahoe.  Switchgear feels as if it is made to last.  The only exception to the quality feel of buttons and switches is the cruise control on/off/set/resume buttons mounted on the steering wheel.  These button are the only ones that made me think �this is a Ford� when I used them.  The cruise control buttons are made of a cheap feeling, hard plastic that lack a definite �click� when in use.  These same buttons do not light up as do the rest of the switches on the dash.  The rear seats can be folded down with ease, and access to the rear is made easy through a full hatchback type door, or a smaller, pop-open glass.  The Tribute has an excellent stereo.  Mazda has perfected the in-dash CD changer.  I love that you can listen to 6 CDs without having to get out of the car to load them.

On the road the Mazda Tribute lives up to its zoom zoom moniker by delivering 200 hp from a V-6. Acceleration is brisk. 200 horsepower may not sound like a lot, but a much larger Toyota Camry XLE delivers 194 hp, while the Hyundai Santa Fe gives its V-6 buyer about 180 hp.  The standard Nissan Xterra delivers 170 hp, add 40 to the supercharged version and the Xterra and Nissan can finally play in the same sandbox as the other small to midsize SUVs it was intended to compete against. The Tribute is so powerful, I found stop and go traffic to be a real hassle � it seems I could never press the gas pedal softly enough.  The main advantage Santa Fe and Xterra have over the Tribute is noise control.  The Hyundai is slightly underpowered, but even its heavily taxed engine doesn�t make nearly as much racket as the Tribute�s beefy V-6.  If you are looking for a soft ride from a midsize SUV, get the Santa Fe.  The Tribute offers better handling and stiffer suspension, but ride quality suffers as a result.  In fact, the Ford Escape is more softly sprung than the Tribute.  On the open highway, the Tribute settles into a fairly smooth ride, but uneven pavement and potholes remind the driver of Tribute�s truck roots.  There is always a trade off � better handling often means a firmer ride.

Overall the Mazda Tribute is a very worthy small sport utility vehicle.  Bland styling and excessive road noise are its main pitfalls.  The Nissan Xterra and Hyundai Santa Fe are very similar vehicles and each offers a bit of a different twist on the same theme.  Pick the Tribute if you are looking for cute styling, sporty handling, and brisk acceleration.  Tribute offers buyers an excellent value, for about $20,000 you can get a Tribute V-6 with the features most of us have come to expect in a new car. 

As a side note, I recently reviewed the Saab 9-3  SE convertible.  For about the same price as that one car, you could buy a Mazda Tribute ES V-6 and a Mazda Miata.  Something to think about.
