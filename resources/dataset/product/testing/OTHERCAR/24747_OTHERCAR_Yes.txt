            Having a background in 35mm photography, I thought I'd venture into the digital realm and WOW!

The Sony DSCS70 is one of the best. I use it almost daily. it is small enough to keep with and has one of the longest batteries I could find. Charge it once for a couple of hours and it is good for almost a week of use. The camera can be set to be automatic for the most simple of users and yet also can be either shutter or apt preferred modes. It also is able to be movie shorts and sounds. The only thing that I would improved on the camera is to make the menu selection a bit larger to read. I would also suggest a 32 or 64 meg memory stick because the 8 can get filled up quickly.

Over all it meets this photographers need very well.<br><br>
