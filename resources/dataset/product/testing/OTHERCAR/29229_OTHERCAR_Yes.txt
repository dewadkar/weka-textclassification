            I bought my Mighty Max used at the local Ford dealership back in June of 1999, it is a 1991 standard cab model with the standard 5-speed.  It has factory A/C and a tow package.  When I got it, it only had 90000 miles on it, pretty good for a car that's almost 10 years old.  The previous owner had used it as a tow vehicle behind his Motor Home and had cut a chunk out of the front bumper to accomodate a hitch.  I figure this pickup was towed quite a bit because the tranny was still good and tight when you moved the shifter through it's paces.   The previous owner had also not really &quot;driven&quot; this truck if you know what I mean.  At first, I was a little dismayed because the truck would barely cruise at 65.  After some coaxing and massaging it finally opened up and after I replaced the plugs and aircleaner, it started to run like I new it could.  I love everything about this truck, it's strong, solid, economical and it cruises at 75 mph without even straining.  It's too bad Mitsubishi doesn't import a pickup anymore. (They do in Australia) If they did, I'd buy a new one.  <br><br>
