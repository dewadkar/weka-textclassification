            Originally, in 1994, I was looking at the LeBaron Convertible but it had very little trunk space, so I ended up purchasing LeBaron Sedan with Vinyl roof. In 1999, it was fully paid off and I intend to keep it for another 5 years.  It is a low maintenance vehicle.  I have kept it in great condition over the years.  

When I see a LeBaron on the road, my eye is always attracted to it and I comment, &quot;NICE CAR&quot;.  It's ride is smooth and the passengers always comment what comfortable seats it has. It is easy to handle.

Previously, I had always been a Chevrolet person.  However, I have enjoyed this LeBaron so much, I am now a pleased Chrysler fan.  

One flaw is that the air conditioning system needs to be charged regularly so that it keeps up, especially in Florida. 

You would enjoy a LeBaron, but they have stopped making them. Old models are probably a good bet!<br><br>
