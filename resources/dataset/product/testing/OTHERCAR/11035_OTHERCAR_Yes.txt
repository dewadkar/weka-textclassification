            If you've read some of my other reviews, you might know I'm going to be facing a transportation crisis in six months to a year. #3 child is due in November. A booster seat, toddler seat, and infant carrier can only fit in the back seat of my current car, but it's tight. Very tight. And when #3 needs a car seat next summer--I'm not sure I'll be able to make that work.

Some people say I'm going to need a minivan. Problem is, I love driving my current car, and wouldn't want to give it up for a less enjoyable vehicle.

Which brings me to the Mazda MPV. Right inside the front cover of the brochure is Mazda's bold claim: "Body of a minivan, soul of a sports car." That's what I'm going to need. But does the MPV truly deliver on this claim?

Note: I took a more extended test drive in a 2003 MPV. My further updated review can be found <b><a href="/content_79854145156">here</a></b>.

<b>Styling</b>

Well, the MPV delivers on the first half. No one looking at this vehicle is going to think anything other than "minivan." The previous MPV because a pseudo-SUV late in its life, but the current model makes no pretensions style-wise to anything else. 

Even among minivans some are easier on the eyes. Sadly, the MPV is not among your more stylish minivans, even with the 17" alloys on the ES I drove. The look is 7/8 Honda Odyssey, which wouldn't be all bad if the proportions weren't thrown off by the reduction. But they are. The rear end in particular looks too long and boxy. It fails to continue the somewhat sporty look of the front end. I suspect this is because the well for the fold-into-the-floor third seat requires a longish rear overhang (the seat must stow behind the wheels).

Inside the MPV also has its flaws. The pentagon-shaped center stack looks a bit odd, but that's a minor issue. More disturbing is the huge amount of obviously plastic wood slathered everywhere. Not exactly congruent with the sporty image they're trying to project. The perforated leather steering wheel points in a better direction here.

<b>Accommodations</b>

The MPV is smaller than most other minivans. It's length of 188 inches is roughly the same as the regular wheelbase Chrysler and GM vans, but over a foot shorter than the long versions, Ford Windstar, and Honda Odyssey. The MPV's width at 72 inches matches the GM vans, but is four to six inches narrower than the segment leaders. These compact dimensions might help support the sporty image they're going for, but it's not so good for people and cargo space. 

The front row fares well. Here the narrow width might even help. Plenty of room, but not so much you feel you're piloting a boat. I had six inches of air over my head without the sunroof, so even tall people should have plenty of room. Visibility is excellent, especially forward, as in most minivans. 

Rear seat passengers don't fare so well. Legroom is tight in the second row, very tight in the third. As in most minivans, both rows are mounted too low to provide thigh support to adults. The seats themselves also feel on the small side.

Mazda managed to steal a couple of features from Honda that really help seating versaility., The second row is split into two halves, and the right half slides to form either two captains chairs or a single bench. The former can be helpful in keeping a pair of children separated (no "he's on my side again"), while the latter makes getting to and from the third row a bit easier.

Unique among minivans, the second row has roll down windows. Intuitively I like this feature, but must wonder how often it would really be used. In Chrysler's, Ford's, and Honda's minivans these windows don't even pop open, yet people keep buying them.

As for the third row, it can be rotated 90 degrees to serve as a seat for tailgating (something I don't think even the Honda offers) or, as in the Honda, it can be folded completely into the floor. In minivans without this feature, the seat has to be removed to free up cargo space, so this can be very useful for those unexpected large purchases. 

Cargo space also suffers from the short legnth. With the third seat up, the cargo space is deep, because the well for the third seat extends much lower than the rest of the floor, but there's not a lot of space lengthways. Fold the seat into the floor, though, and there's a decent amount of cargo space. For more room, the second row seats can be removed. Note, however, that they do not fold forward, unlike many other minivans. So if you need that space, you must remove them.

The top-of-the-line ES is loaded with features. The van I drove had dual power sliding doors, rear seat aircondition vents with separate controls, and storage bins everywhere (glvoe compartment, a drawer under the front passenger seat, two small compartments in the headliner, another in the center of the dash...) As in the Honda, a collapsible tray can be erected between the front seats. 

<b>On the Road</b>

So far we have a van with a tight but feature-filled interior. The size compromise would all be worthwhile if the "soul of a sports car" bit is for real. 

A new engine for 2002 helps. Previously the MPV had a 170 horsepower 2.5 liter six from Ford. Not enough engine for a nearly two ton vehicle, especially not with many people in it. Ford also makes a 3.0 liter version of the same engine, already sold in the Taurus, Escape, and many other Ford products, so a fix was at hand. For 2002 the MPV gets the larger six. The extra thirty horses are quite welcome. With them, the MPV is no rocket (after all, the much lighter Taurus with the same engine is hardly known for driving thrills), but at least it's no longer a slug. A five speed automatic transmission (one more gear than last year, permitting lower gearing in the lower gears) helps get the most out of the new engine. 

Now for the part that really matters: Handling. Sports car? Well, no. But there are some hints in that direction. Feedback through the wheel is decent--definitely better than other minivans I've driven--and the performance tires on the ES stick as well as they'll ever have to with such a vehicle. The MPV despite the hype still does not encourage aggressive driving. (Can any minivan, ethically?) I did not find myself dreaming of switchbacks during the test drive. There is enough lean in turns that you'll never forget you're driving a minivan. Overall, the MPV felt much like the larger yet still fairly nimble (though unsporting) Honda. 

Update: I just drove a new <b><a href="/content_80487419524">Odyssey</a></b>. For the 2002 model year Honda changed a few things about its van, including the suspension calibrations. The Odyssey now feels considerably more luxurious than it did, but in the process has lost much of the nimble feeling I remember from a test drive of the 2000. It now rides and handles much like a Chrysler van. Consequently, I'm bumping the MPV up a notch. For those who want an agile minivan, it's now the only choice.

A few final boxes to check off: Ride quality and noise levels are average for the class. Nothing uncomfortable, but clearly short of luxury sedan levels.

<b>Pricing</b>

The ES I drove, which had a couple of options, stickered for $28,337. The much larger Honda Odyssey EX-L stickers for just a few hundred more, so on the face of it the MPV does not represent a good value. But Odysseys sell at or above sticker, while it should be possible to get the MPV I drove for comfortably under twenty-seven. That's still a bit close to the price of the Honda for comfort. The LX, which costs about four thousand less, might be the better choice for those who strongly prefer the more compact dimensions of the MPV.

The only other minivans similar to the MPV in size (lenght and width) are the regular wheelbase GM products. The Pontiac Montana is the sportiest of these. With leather, sport suspension, and a power sliding door on the right side (power is not available for the left door), the Montana stickers at $29,390. With the dealer discount, though, it should sell for about the same price as the MPV (using Edmunds as a guide)--but that is before any rebates. No rebate is available on the MPV. On the Pontiac, you can choose between no interest on a 60-month loan or a $3,000 rebate. 

To my eye, the Pontiac looks better. I haven't driven the Pontiac, but suspect it doesn't handle as well as the MPV. Seating is similarly low to the floor, and the interior isn't as versatile. Finally, the 15" wheels on the Pontiac are a far cry from the 17s on the Mazda. The Mazda seems the better choice before considering price, but is it $3,000 better?

<b>Last Words</b>

The MPV's interior is full of useful innovative features, but it trades off too much interior space for its slight advantage in handling. Bottom line: I'm still not getting into a minivan without a whole lot of kicking and screaming along the way. And if this does come to pass, there's not enough zoom zoom here to win me over.

Update: After driving the revised Odyssey, I now recommend the MPV for those who want the most fun-to-drive minivan available even if it costs them in other areas.
