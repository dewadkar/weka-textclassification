            Southern Californians are a strange lot.  Pull up in the driveway in just about any SUV and you're greeted with a chorus of "Cool!".  Show up in your all-wheel drive Subaru Legacy sedan and those same friends and relations will take one look at the gleaming "<i><b>AWD</i></b>" badge and snort "But it doesn't snow around here and you don't even ski!"

Although I own a 1996 Subaru Legacy L All-Wheel Drive Sedan, Subaru saw the light with the 1997 model year and made a bold decision: front-wheel drive is out; single-axle traction control is a thing of the past; all-wheel drive is the only way to go.  They've never looked back.  So, whether you live in the Snow Belt of New England or the mostly snow-free altitudes of sunny SoCal, the ONLY way you can buy a new Subaru these days is with all-wheel drive.

That's quite a change in direction for the car company that introduced the USA to affordable front-wheel drive cars, but was quickly run over by the rest of the auto industry.  Perhaps General Motors views Subaru as some sort of barometer and already senses the beginning of the end of front-wheel drive.  Why else would they acquire 20% of Fuji Heavy Industries, the parent company of Subaru?  All-wheel drive Subaru sedans and wagons have even been photographed by industry spies while being put through their paces on test tracks owned by the likes of Porsche and Mercedes Benz.  There's something inside every all-wheel drive Subaru that many in the auto industry want, and they want it bad.

Made in USA by Subaru-Isuzu Automotive in Lafayette, Indiana, the 1996 Legacy L All-Wheel Drive Sedan is the second year of the model's first revision.  The 2.2 litre flat-4 single overhead cam engine kicks up 135 horsepower, hardly pavement-warping propulsion but then, Subarus were never really marketed to the sexually insecure with money to burn.  It'll keep up with just about everyone else on the freeway and rarely runs out of on-ramp before reaching freeway velocity.  On long highway trips, fuel economy is about 28 miles to the gallon.

The no-nonsense dashboard and instrumentation sport the kind of stuff you pay extra for on most other family sedans.  A tachometer sits side-by-side with the speedo.  They're flanked by the fuel and coolant temperature gauges.  The only thing really lacking is the oil pressure gauge often found in sports cars and trucks.  Indicator lamps monitor oil pressure, air bag, brakes and ABS.  There's even a lamp to tell you if the automatic transmission fluid is overheating.  Gone are the standard map lights and, on automatic transmission models, the heads-up shifter position lights between the speedometer and tach.

Most major controls, like headlights and windshield wipers, have moved to the steering column.  You twist a knob on the turn signal stalk to turn on the headlights.  Pushing the same stalk away brings up the high beams.  A separate rocker switch turns on the parking lamps.  One nice touch: the headlights ONLY come on with the starter switch in the ON position, not ACC, OFF or locked.  A twin stalk on the other side of the steering column runs the windshield wipers and washer.  For the 1996 model year, all-wheel drive was an option.  All L trim sedans and wagons came standard with 4-wheel disc brakes with ABS along with cruise control.  Air conditioning is standard on ALL Subarus.

On the road, the combination of all-wheel drive, long travel suspension and rack-and-pinion steering with variable power assist give the driver a marvelous sense of control.  The 4-speed automatic jolts slightly going from 1st to second gear, which is typical for cars this size, but after that, you can sometimes hardly feel the shifts.  Rounding a corner at about 30 miles an hour barely produces a squeal of protest from the tires.  On twisty mountain roads, an occasional downshift is necessary but one rarely feels a need to jump on the brakes.  Once the cruise control is set on a nice long stretch of desert road, it's driver's Nirvana until the next rest stop.

On our annual trek from southern California to Lake Tahoe, the Legacy really struts its stuff during that last climb up Kingsbury Grade.  SUVs and Celicas, Preludes and even a Porsche or 2 have to think twice about how fast they're heading into some of those hairpins while my humble Legacy sedan handles it as easily as turning a corner in town, giving the rest of them a good look at the license plate frame in back that proudly proclaims "MADE IN U.S.A.  SO THERE!!" along with that gleaming "<b><i>AWD</b></i>" badge.
