            The Olympus C-3020 Zoom is the same camera as their <a href="/content_43791126148">Olympus Camedia C-3000 Zoom Digital Camera</a> with some added features. This is the camera that I was told would replace the C-3000. The C-3000 is an excellent camera, I know I own one and love it, so the C3020 will be a plus since both are the same retail price of $499. 

This is a 3.2 Megapixels digital camera with a 3X optical and 2.5 digital zoom lens that is equivalent to a 32mm-92mm lens in 35mm photography. It has a built-in flash with 6 modes including red-eye reduction.

<b>********************************</b>
<b>The Added Extras</b>
Here are the extra features that you get over the <a href="/content_43791126148">Olympus Camedia C-3000 Zoom Digital Camera.</a>

<b><i>Extended Battery Life</b></i> &#150 The C-3020 has a redesigned circuitry to use less battery power, so your batteries should last longer.

<b><i>My Mode</b></i> &#150 Here you can manually setup the way you want the camera to be to your preferences and you can access it on the mode dial.

<b><i>New Scene Program Modes</b></i> &#150 Here you can choose from portrait, sports, landscape-portrait, night-scene and QuickTime movie modes.

<b><i>Noise Reduction System</b></i> &#150 This is to give you a sharper and more colorful photo.

<b><i>USB Auto Connect</b></i> &#150 Once you configure your computer with the software provided will set it up for automatic detection. In other words when you plug your camera to the USB port it will automatically have your camera up and running to use on the computer in seconds. This is only for Windows ME, 2000, XP or Mac OS 8.6. 

<b><i>16MB SmartMedia card</b></i> The C-3000 comes with an 8MB <a href="/content_44580114052">SmartMedia Memory Card.</a>

<b><i>More frames per second</b></i> The C-3000  can click off 1.2 frames per second while the C-3020 can click off 1.7 frames per second and burst up to 5 frames in HQ mode.

<b><i>Movies</b></i> In the movie mode it will record the movies longer before shutting off.
<b>********************************</b>

<b>Movies</b>
The Olympus C-3020 can also take home movies for you in QuickTime. There are two modes to choose from 320x240 pixels or 160x120 pixels.

In the 320x240 pixels mode it will take up to 38 seconds of movies before stopping. You can always stop it at anytime.

In the 160x120 pixels mode it will take up to 168 seconds of movies before stopping.

For me the 160x120 pixels mode is too small.

<b>The Photos</b>
Now there are 5 sizes to choose from when taking your photos, 2048 X 1536, 1600 X 1200, 1,280 X 960, 1,024 X 768 and 640 X 480.

Now the amount of photos you get on the 16MB card depends on the size you pick and the quality of your settings, SQ, HQ and SHQ.  (SQ-Normal Quality, HQ-High Quality SHQ-Super High Quality)

If you save them in the TIFF format it will hold only one in the highest resolution of 2048 X 1536 to about 16 in the 640 X 480 mode.

Now if you save your photos on the JPEG format (I recommend) you can get about 8 in the best resolution of 2048 X 1536 to about 165 in the 640 X 480 SQ mode.

<b>My final words!</b>
I used the Olympus C-3020 zoom for about 2 weeks and love it as much as my <a href="/content_43791126148">Olympus Camedia C-3000 Zoom Digital Camera.</a>

With the Noise Reduction System I couldn&#146t see much of an improvement, the My Mode I wouldn&#146t use and the New Scene Program Modes is something else I would not use.

The USB Auto Connect is nice and fast but I use a SmartMedia Reader for viewing and transferring all of my photos to the hard drive and I use PhotoShop 6 for my editing, so there is no use for me to connect my camera to my computer.

The 16MB <a href="/content_44580114052">SmartMedia Memory Card</a> is an improvement but I think they should have went with at least a 32MB card or 64MB card.

The faster frames per second are noticeable and the longer movie time is also nice because you can always stop it when ever you want.

For the extended battery life I get between 90 to 100 photos using my <a href="/content_43791126148">Olympus Camedia C-3000</a> from NiMH rechargeable batteries. The Olympus C-3020 gave me 107 photos from the first set of rechargeable batteries and 109 on the second charge, so there is some improvement here. The amount of shots will vary depending on your camera settings and use of the LCD viewer. All my photos were taken with the LCD on.

My final word is yes I wish I could swap my C-3000 for the C-3020 but for me it is not worth paying any extra between the two. Both produce excellent photos!
