            After much deliberation between the Acura MDX, Lexus RX 300 and the Nissan Pathfinder LE 4X4 I decided to go with the Pathfinder (PF). The MDX had me sold on its size, engine and standard options. What it didn't have me sold on was the high sticker price! I have a VERY hard time paying full MSRP for any vehicle especially one with no prior track record for reliability. Listening to the radio one afternoon I heard that a local Nissan dealership was having a huge sale on everything in the lot and that Nissan was providing 3.9% financing! Before going to the dealership I jumped on www.edmunds.com and got all the necessary info like dealer invoice and how much the hold back was on this vehicle. Pulling into the lot I noticed it was full of sales people and tons and tons of vehicles. All of these symbols told me that I would have no problem getting the deal I wanted. I grabbed a salesman (which was no problem) and took a LE 4x4 PF with the leather option for a test drive. I was extremely impressed with the vehicles quiet ride and 0-60 speed. The leather and power seats feel great (some of the best I have ever ridden in) and the seat memory option allows two different drivers to have their favorite sitting positions saved. The Bose speaker system is first rate and six disc changer is in a great location. The moon roof is a vast open space and almost makes one think they are in a convertible! I am six feet tall and had no problem with the back seat, but if you have family or friends that are taller than that they might have a problem with the leg room. Another nice feature is the security system and the central locking system. The remote has a panic button and is programmable to meet the needs of the owner. To top it all off the PF can tow five thousand pounds! Perfect for a boat or trailer. Lastly I managed to get this SUV for three-hundred dollars below invoice! At that price this SUV goes from a good buy to the best vehicle on the road for the money! So if your in the market for a SUV and don't want to pay MSRP, test drive a PF and you will be smiling all the way to the bank!
