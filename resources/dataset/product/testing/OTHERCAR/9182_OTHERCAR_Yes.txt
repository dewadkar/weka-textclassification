                The Jeep Cherokee base model 4 cylinder, 2WD, 2 door, standard transmission, is definitely the poor mans SUV.  I really didn't want to buy a new car when I did but when my wife got pregnant I needed something a little bigger than my mini truck.  ( I miss my low payment, great on gas, haul anything, mini truck).

    Well I looked around and there was simply no other way to go the base model Jeep was the biggest safest vehicle I could buy on my meager budget.  Even though the 2WD is really a glorified station wagon it sure looks allot cooler and rides allot better.  Not to mention SUV's are much safer.  The one good thing about the 4-cylinder engine is that it gets fairly decent gas mileage for a SUV.  On the other hand when heading to the mountains be prepared to downshift to third quite a bit. The base model Jeep is not exactly a powerhouse.  Which means if you are planning to haul something, it better not be too big.

    The other complaint I have with the Jeep is that there is allot of plastic in its construction.  Not like the Jeeps of yore (all metal).  This leads to wear and tear problems sooner or later.  My window dressing keeps popping out on the driver's side window not the seal than god but the hard plastic dressing.  It's no biggie it pops right back in but for 15,000 dollars should I have to pop it back in every few days.  The only other problem I had right away with my Jeep is that the interior dome light shorted on me two months after I bought it.  This was no biggie because I hat those dome lights anyway and disconnected it.

  As far as major problems I have had none.  The Jeep has 50,000 miles on it and I have only had to change the oil.  It always starts and has never broke down.  The ground clearance is excellent even with the two-wheel drive you still get to fell like you are 4 wheeling at times.  There are allot of safety features on the new Jeeps that started with the 98 models like better crumple zones and engine placement.  Of course air bags are standard on all Jeeps now and Jeep even added passenger air bags before they were mandatory.

    Overall, I like my Jeep or should I say my wifeï¿½s Jeep she slowly took it over but she is the one who transports the youngins so I guess it is how it should be.  I don't know how I get stuck with the old car every time though.  Those of you who are married will know what I am talking about.  For the money you shell out the base Jeep Cherokee is a great buy.  My only suggestion if you have kids and you can afford the 4 door get it because it is a pain climbing in and out of the 2 door.  Putting babies in can be a strain on your back.  I would definitely buy another Jeep but I would get a 4 door next time.
