            I'll start by saying that I'm a professional photographer, so a product has to be pretty good to impress me. But this camera did it.  The picture quality is superb, due in no small part to the Carl Zeiss optics. Top of the line, bar none.

It has some great features that you won't find on other digital cameras in this price range. The one that comes to mind is the infrared capabilities. Not that I take a lot of pictures in the dark, but it's like walking around with night vision goggles. You can also use this in movie mode. Very cool. The Infolithium battery is great, too. It's proprietary Sony, but any battery that tells you how much longer it will last in minutes is a good thing in my book.

Some reviewers have complained about the design of the camera and it's "odd" L shape. But I found it to be very natural. When I hold a camera, I typically grip the body with the right hand and hold the lens with the left for manual focusing and f-stop adjustment. So the ergonomics seemed right on to me. I also like the weight of the camera. It felt substantial in my hands, and I didn't feel like it would break if I held it too tightly.

I dropped the quality of the photos down so I could fit 50 shots on a 32Mb disk, and the quality was still great. More than adequate for snapshots. But you still have the option to capture uncompressed TIFF files at resolutions high enough to produce high-quality large format prints.

I can't say enough good things about this camera. So far I have found nothing I don't like. If you're a casual user looking for a point-n-shoot small enough to fit in your pocket, this probably isn't the camera for you. But if you're a hobbyist or even a pro looking for a lower cost entry into the digital world, this camera is definitely worth it.

BTW, my amount paid includes a $100 rebate.
