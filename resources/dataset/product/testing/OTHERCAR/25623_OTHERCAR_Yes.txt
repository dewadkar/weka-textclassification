            I bought my SW2 because of the price and smooth styling.  I had an unhappy experience back in 1984 with another compact automobile and swore I would never own another one.  How things change over the period of a few years.  I had read some reports in Consumer Reports Magazine and liked what I read.  I am an RVer and liked what I read in some RV magazines also.  This has been the best compact I have ever owned.  I love the gas mileage and comfort, true, there could be a bit more padding for this senior citizen, but really, it is quite comfortable.  I have had five adults in my wagon and have had no problem with power on hills or mountain passes.  Hiway travel is a dream.  The SW2 is a great vehicle for young and old.  I would not hesitate to recommend this or any other Saturn to anyone.  <br><br>
