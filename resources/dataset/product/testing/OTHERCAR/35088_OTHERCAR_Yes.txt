             ... you climb in and you never want to get out. :)

I adore my '97 Outback Sport.  It's the first Subaru I've owned and now I know why everyone I know who owns one won't buy anything else.  They're practically indestructible and really fun to drive.

How does it drive?  Well, have you've ever seen a cat running across a carpeted floor?  That's it.  This car corners like a cat on velcro.  No joke.  I've never driven a car that felt so solid and firmly attached to the road.  Corner hard and it does not lean a bit.  Stomp on the gas and it leaps forward.  Stomp on the brakes and it'll stop on a dime.  It feels like a street-legal rally car.  Not surprising since Imprezas have won an awful lot of rally competitions in the past few years.

Unlike a lot of compact cars these days, this car is solid.  No tinny doors, no plastic body.  No more driving in a tin can.  This car has plenty of steel in it and it shows.  At the same time, it does not remotely feel heavy or bulky.  Nicely balanced.

A couple of minor gripes.  Gas mileage could be better.  We average around 28-30 mpg in town, 30-35 mpg on the highway.  Not great, but a small price to pay for full time all wheel drive.  Second, those cheap plastic stock wheel covers.  I've already have one break and fall off and they show scuffs pretty badly.  I think the newer model years have better wheel covers, but the ones I have are definitely in need of replacement.

I always used to wonder why I saw so many rusty old Subarus on the road.  Now I know ... they run forever and their owners love 'em.  Call me a convert.
