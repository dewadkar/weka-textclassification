            I replaced my 1999 Solara with the new 2004 model. After 1000 miles my new Solara has met/exceeded all expectations. The big improvement is in the V-6 engine which I understand Toyota borrowed from the Lexus RAV-4. It is strong silent and very gas efficient. I appreciate the extra horsepower when passing or getting on the interstates. Interior is beautiful. Very nice smooth flowing interior no rough edges. The heated front seats have been great. I equipped the car with the XM radio system. This leads to total isolation from the outside world since the ride is so smooth and the quiet cabin is very impressive. The car arrived with no defects. Car lacks a cigarette lighter and ashtray which have been replaced with two 12 volt outlets. One is for the XM radio receiver and one I use to recharge my cell phone. The car has lots of useful storage pockets in the interior along with well designed cup holders etc. Trunk is roomy etc. etc. My only regret is that in 6 months I will be seeing scores of new Solaras on the highway. 
I paid 25,500 for the car which is about the same price I paid 4 years ago for my first Solara. I noticed that Toyota has upgraded the moon roof by adding more soundproofing and  more reliable hardware. Overall I am very pleased with my purchase. One bad point - the rear view vision is poorer due to the redesign of the side rear windows.
