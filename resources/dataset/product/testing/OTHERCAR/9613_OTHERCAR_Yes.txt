            The first 13000 miles on the Celica have been flawless. For a 1.6L 4-cylinder engine, it certainly packs a punch. And with over 30 miles to the gallon it deserves its reputation as one of the more fuel-efficient sports cars on the market. Toyota did an excellent job of making sure that every detail was aesthetically as well as functionally well designed. In short, the car is gorgeous (yes, for all those who were wondering, the hood scoop IS functional!). It's stubby front-end makes it a little girly for my taste, but as a chick-car this thing can't be beat. Her car has automatic transmission with overdrive, which offers a less than smooth, but reasonably comfortable ride. The seats are fairly flat and lack any type of adjustment options whatsoever, but offer a reasonably pleasant sit--as long as you're not in the back. Like import sports cars, calling the backseat &quot;cramped&quot; is an understatement. The stereo produces rich sound (and lots of it), but produces too &quot;round&quot; of a sound for my taste. We have yet to see how these flashy little cars will stand the test of time in durability as well as style, but for now the 2000 Celica is a great choice for someone who wants something sporty and trendy, but has no real need for speed.<br><br>
