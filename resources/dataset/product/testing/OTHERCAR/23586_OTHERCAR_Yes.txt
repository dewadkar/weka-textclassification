               Eyecatching and fun is the way I would describe my little silver bullet. It definitely has the male attention. Everytime I drive it, guys act like it is Cindy Crawford or Julia Roberts. One particular time,a man took out his teeth and asked what we were doing for the next forty years. Yeah.
   Going from a two door car to a four door was a nice change. I really enjoy this car because it has the convenience of a four door with the sportiness of a two door.
  This is my second Lexus and I have had stereo problems with both. I just got this one replaced. (the IS300)I wonder if that is a reoccuring Lexus problem. It definitely doesn't change my opinion about the car though. I love it immensely.
  The lights are fun and distinct. The heated seats are oh so nice. The interior lights up into a fun orange color..
This little baby is a must have.
