            I purchased this vehicle used.  When I got it, I knew there were tweaks to make that being something one should always expect from a older car.
Yet still, at 1,000 miles over needing and oil change and 10,000 over a tranny flush I drove her 538 miles home in a February blizzard and she drove like a champ.
The highway ride was probably the most leg-roomy comfortable ride I've had in a great number of years.

Under the hood she boasts a modest 318 V8 in my opinion one of Chryslers better engines and she's proven that much to be very true.  this powerhouse V8 even after wearing a quater million miles still hit 100 mph and better on command without fail. ( no officer I really wasn't speeding just forget what I just said )

Repairs made afterwords were mostly standard upkeep;
*Oil change
*Transmission Flush
*Wiper blades
*Radiator flush
*Break pads
*pvc valve change

The stock stereo was perhaps reminescent of the times and in need of change but wasn't bad, it still held the station and kept me awake on the road

The seats are adorne with a comforting leather covering that had worn it's years into an inviting cradle for the drive.

I won't lie, she's a gas drinker, I spent about $80 on gas for 500 miles.

Trunk space and passenger space are in an amazing surplus.
I had been very pleased to find that I could feasably fit a dozen dead bodies into the trunk without having to remove their heads (an estimation).
