            I bought my 1998 Nissan Maxima GXE in 1999. I bought 'Cheryl' used, at 28,000 mi., while I was out shopping for an Acura 2.5TL. I happened upon it at the Acura dealership, and took it for a spin. I thought there must be rocket fuel in the engine!!! Nope, 190 hp and 205 lbs. of torque! Phew! I bought it that night. It was a heather mist (taupey silver-ish) color, with dark gray velour interior. 

Aside from the awesome power of this vehicle, I loved the roomy interior. My kids could fit nicely in the back seat with their backpacks and soccer bag, and basketball/softball equipment, and a friend- or two if need be. I will say on desperate occasions, I have had 6 adults in that car at one time. 

The ride, well, it's great. So smooth, that you look down at the speedometer, and you say- &quot;This is 90 mph? This thing must be broken!&quot; It's that smooth. Not a bump, not a sound. With the amount of torque and horsepower, the pick-up is phenomenal. When I drive the Jersey Turnpike, and some imbecile cuts me off, I have the option of hitting the gas pedal, and changing lanes rather quickly. Fast, fast, fast. That is one of the best things about this car! It's power has its' downside too. 

The power offsets the cars ability to handle turns. The power in this car, coupled with its light weight, (just a shade over 3,000 lbs.) means that this car is not a treat to drive in the rain, snow, ice, or any adverse weather condition. When getting onto the highway, merging with traffic in these conditions, give yourself plenty of room, as you will skid, slip, and the wheels will spin. Beware. 

I heard a cocophony of screeches and squeals while making turns at higher speeds, and my tires really took a beating. I replaced two during one year of driving. The brakes left much to be desired, as I had them done twice in one year, however, they still failed to perform perfectly. Also, when making a tight turn, and braking, there were many squeals and moans from the steering column. 

The clear coat on the car also began peeling, and looked rather unsightly after a while. Keep in mind I did buy the car used, as many of you reading this review would have to do, since it is a 1998 model. The previous owner may not have taken proper care of the clear coat, so look for bubbling along the bumpers, and forget the car if you see any. It looked awful after one year. 

The car's stereo was really poor, as at high volumes, the sound was distorted, and muffled. The cruise control worked well, although i used it rather infrequently. The seats were fairly comfortable in front, although my 2000 neon's sport buckets are much more comfy. The rear seat was exceptionally comfortable. 

The interior storage was excellent, although the lid on my cup holder broke after a while; it was rather flimsy. Another peeve was the location of the trunk release on the driver's side door. The button was inadvertently pressed many a time when reaching for the contents within the door pocket, just below it, or when fastening or removing my seat belt. It was really annoying. Trunk space was unsurpassed however. I fit three beach chairs, two full softball bags, my bowling bag, and varied miscellany at one time, with room to spare. 

Don't get me wrong, I really loved this car, but the power was not handled well by the general design of the vehicle. In my opinion, if you have 190 hp, and 205 lbs. of torque, you want to use it. The car was not really fond of starting in the cold, it started, albeit reluctantly. If you are looking at this base model, try not to pay more than 12 or 13 thousand for it, and try to drive very carefully in the rain!!

I just sold mine in July, so I no longer own it, but I gave it a good run. I think if you live in an area where there isn't much rain or snow, you should have no problems. Handling was my major concern in this car, as the h.p. suggests a sports car, it is clearly NOT a sports car, but a family sedan.
