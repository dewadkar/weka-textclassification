             My wife and I purchased a 2000 Kia Sephia from Brodie Kia in Wichita Falls, TX.  We love our little Kia! We've had it since the last week in October of 2000. Our car was built May 29 2000, and it had about 5 miles on the speedo when we first test drove it. Our Kia is the plain jane model, with just Air and Automatic, plus it had cloth seats and floor mats included for free. We got a 750 rebate, plus the dealership knocked off $600 off the price, when all is said and done(trade-in, etc), we financed it for $11,600. What was really cool is we put down $100.00 and a junk car on a trade in!! All we wanted was a good car and warranty( what can I say about the warranty?? It's Great!) 5years/60,000 miles bumper to bumper and 10 year/100,000 miles on drivetrain, and 5 year, 50,000 miles roadside assistance.
  I am really pleased with the performance of the 16 valve engine, it's great, a mixture of power and fuel economy.  We have three children, so with five of us, two adults and three kids, there is plenty of room for us all in the Sephia.
  I especially like the trunk space(back seats also fold down for more space), it worked out great with this past Christmas shopping, plenty of room to put Christmas purchases.
  Our Sephia fits us perfectly, we had already made up our minds to get a basic car, one without alot of perks, although this car doesn't have alot of fancy things like power windows or door locks, it is comfortable, and isn't lacking in storage or creature comforts, the whole car is well thought out, and planned out well, everything is in easy reach, easy to use/operate.
   The paint and fit/finish of the car are very good. Although the interior is not a luxury car interior, it is good looking, it doesn't look shabby or third rate, as well as the outside is good looking also.
  The climate control, defrost and A/C and Heat are all superb! All controls are easy to understand, Dash is very easy to understand, Owners manual does a very good job of explaination if you don't know what is what.
  The only problem I have with the car is the tires in wet weather, the tires seem to handle much better in dry weather than wet, they seem to like to hydroplane if you don't keep a hold of the steering wheel, I suspect better quality , more like all season tires would be better suited.
   I would absolutely recommend this car to anyone who needs a good reliable car that is also easy to afford.
    Like I said, we've had our 2000 Kia Sephia since about October 25, 2000(had 5 miles on her), and we have approximately 3500 miles on her now, and it's been great!
