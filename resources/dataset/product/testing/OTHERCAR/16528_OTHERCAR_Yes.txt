            Intro 
I bought my 1996 1/2 Jetta (manual) new in 1996. I've always been a VW fan as I had a 1991 Golf previously. At the time the Jetta was an excellent choice over the Honda Civic and others as you really got a lot more for your money. As I got my Jetta on the year going out, I got a manufacturers discount which put it far under the price of a basic Civic hatchback, plus I had the standard alarm and automatic locks. 
When new 
In the beginning, this was a solid car, with a great feeling of the road and a tight suspension. For the first year or so the car was great with the following exceptions. 

I had a syncro problem with my manual transmission, shifting quickly from 1st to 2nd would cause the gears to grind. This was fixed quickly under warranty. 

The rear doors didn't (and still don't) close well/properly. 

During the winter the locks regularly freeze 

The windshield is of poor quality, scratches and cracks easily 

The paint (my car is black) scratches very easily and is quite thin, it's of vary poor quality. 

Oddly enough, there is no trunk light on the 1996 model (Canada). Pretty annoying when the interior is black. 

This car has drums in the rear, while earlier models had disks. 

ABS was not standard. 
Positive over time 

I find this car with the manual transmission fairly peppy. It has a tight and sporty feel to it. I love the interior, although basic, it's easy to see the instrumentation and use things like the heater and radio. Over the 6 years I have had the car, the reliability has been pretty good, I haven't had any major problems. The interior and trunk are a good size. 
Negative over time 

The paint problem hasn't gotten any better. The exhaust system was rusted out after only 2 years. The car tends to lose it's tight feeling over the years, but I suppose this is true of any car. I can see the beginnings of rust on the window frames (the dull black metal) also, this is likely normal of a car of it's age in Canada. Aside from regular maintenance, I had some oil seal problems, replaced the starter, and recently my airbag warning light has been coming on. That's the extent of what might be abnormal. I've done the brakes a few times, the exhaust and the suspension. That's probably all normal for a car with 155,000 kms. 
Overall 
I still love my car and I would buy it again. I have heard some horror-stories though, and I believe that sometimes buyers can be unlucky with the Mexican manufacturing of this car. If only the newer Jettas were in the same price-class. Either you like the looks of them, or you don't.
