            This is our 2nd Rodeo and for the most part we love everything about it.
It is so easy to get kids in and out of, there is enough head and leg room,for tall people, both in the front and the back seats. There is plenty of room for stuff on weekend trips to the city or mountains. I like that it is a nice looking car and yet it is still functional for a family and i don't have to worry about the kids trashing it.
Until recently it has been very dependable. 
For a couple weeks it has been a little hard to start when it was warmed up but sitting for half hour or so. Turns out the fuel injectors were leaking and causing the engine to flood. Then they found the battery was low and that the alternator was not fully charging. There has also been a funny smell from the engine...Valve cover gaskets on both sides are leaking. We have kept up on all the scheduled maintenance, get regular oil changes etc etc. The only thing we didn't do was get the extended warranty
There are only 22,500 miles on this car.A little soon to have this much go wrong.  <br><br>
