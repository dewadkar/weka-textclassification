            I don't own this camera, but we have one at work.  That's actually about the only way I can afford to get near one.

This is certainly a nice camera.  I am most impressed by the hefty 14x optical zoom lens - it's rare to find a digital camera that even has an optical zoom at all, and those are usually in the 3x range.  Most manufacturers proudly point to their digital zoom, but let's face it, digital zooms don't do anything but pixelize your picture.  Optical zooms are a must.

I don't know which way to lean on the use of a floppy drive for storage media.  Yes, it's convenient, and you'll never run out of floppies.  The problem is, floppy drives have moving parts, so it's that much more likely to break.  Flash media is more expensive, but you don't have to worry about a write head crashing on it.  The floppy drive does read and write quickly, so there's not much of a delay between pictures.  Still, don't plan on holding down the button and getting 5 shots per second - it's more like one shot every other second.

Picture quality has been pretty good.  Most of our pictures have turned out somewhat dark, but then again our building is somewhat dark.  The LCD viewscreen is a nice size, and the tilt feature is very convenient.  The LCD rotates up off the camera and tilts so you can angle the camera and still see what you're shooting.  You can also scroll through the pictures on the disk to see what you've already got.

All in all, this is an impressive piece of equipment.  If you're tired of developing film, or you wind up scanning all your photos into your computer anyway, it could well be worth the price.  The only caveat is the floppy drive - Sony is the only manufacturer using it, and there's no guarantee they'll win this particular industry war.  Then again, even if they lose, it won't affect you once you've got the camera, so as long as it doesn't break, who cares?<br><br>
