             In 1998 it was time for our family to get a new car. We wanted something reliable, roomy, and less than 20k, at the time there were many cars on the market, like the Toyota Camry and Honda accord, but they cost more and didn&#146t have all the features we wanted.

  We ended up getting a gold 1998 Nissan Altima gxe, from mossy Nissan in San Diego. 
   Things I Like about it are the cd/cassette player, power windows, power locks, fake wood, reliability, roomy.

  The Altima Isn't exactly the nicest looking car, but its also not that bad, it has a kind of conservative look. When you get in the first thing you notice is the beautiful two-tone interior, brown and beige. The radio can go LOUD without sounding to distorted and the CD player works great. The seats are pretty comfortable, although the back middle seat isn&#146t, and that seatbelt is hard to adjust. The front seats are comfortable on long trips, because we frequently go to Las Vegas, and phoenix and are in the car for long periods of the time. The air conditioning gets cold fast and you will find yourself adjusting the fan speed because of it, which is good because its hot in California. Ours came with remotes that can automatically unlock/lock the car by the push of a button and it has a little button that you push to make the car honk and its lights flash in case you cant find it. 
  
    When you step on the gas pedal the 150 horsepower, 2.4-liter inline four quickly accelerates and is eager to do what you want it to. The motor is very reliable and ours has over 126,000 miles on it, in just over 5 years. When driving at highway speeds, there is some road noise, but not so much so that it&#146s really bothersome. The breaks work well, but make sure you don&#146t take them to get fixed at some cheap place like my step dad did because you will regret it. Also the breaks make a lot of dust on the front wheels, but you can easily spray it off with a hose. I suggest adding the optional rear spoiler because it makes the car have a sportier look. The gas mileage is about 24MPG.

 The Altima has a huge trunk, and you can put two kids in it (I don&#146t recommend it but my little siblings went in it when we were camping of course while it was off) All in all its a good car, and my mom plans to keep it until the wheels fall off.
