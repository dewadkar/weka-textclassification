            I spent many months reviewing digital cameras to determine the best one to buy.  My highest criteria was excellent color balance, excellent light balance, at least 3.3 megapixels, and full featured.

The Coolpix 880 wins hands down on all of this.  I have consistently taken excellent pictures in the "auto" (point n shoot) mode.  It also has a "Scene" mode, which is a set of 11 presets for common picture-taking scenarios, such as portraits, landscape, indoor party, etc.  The portrait mode, for example, automatically adjusts the focus and lighting to get a perfect portrait.

I have had this camera for just under a year, and have taken over 1100 pictures.  I think the camera has paid for itself.

A recap of other features are:

1-Able to chosen different resolutions and file sizes for the picture
2-Able to total override any setting (if you are a serious photographer)
3-Can take short 40-second videos without audio
4-Has a slideshow mode for reviewing pictures (and you can hook the camera up to your TV to view them)
5-Has a 2.5X zoom on it

There are only a few minor downsides to this camera, which I would categorize more as just things to know:

1-A rechargeable battery and battery charger/AC adapter is an additional $100.  Ouch!
2-It only came with an 8MB Compact Flash card, which is good for 10 pictures of "normal" resolution.
3-I was not impressed with the software bundle, which was a lot of non-standard software.  Having something like Photodeluxe (not MSFT's Print IT) can be very valuable.
4-The red-eye reduction did not always work (which is why some software is nice to have).

However, a larger compact flash card is getting to be pretty cheap.  I have a 128 MB card, which you can get for around $50 (I paid $120 last year).  That hold 162 pictures.

The best part about digital camera in general are that, after you take your pictures, you can review and delete the bad ones.  When I was on vacation last year, I came home with 162 excellent pictures.  This also means that you feel free to take numerous shots of your subject and review them later.

The newer Coolpix 885 is very similar to the 880, but some say the 880 is better.  You can't go wrong either way.

A good place to by digital cameras is mycamera.com.  Ask for Juan Lopez.

One last warning: do not buy a "grey-market" camera, meaning a camera intended for Europe or Asia.  If the price is too good to be true, make sure it is a US model.  Nikon USA only supports US models.
