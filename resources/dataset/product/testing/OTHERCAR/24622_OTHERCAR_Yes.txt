            I bought the Infinity 2000 I-30 after extensive research.  I owned a Lexus ES 300 for 7 years.  Although this Lexus was a top notch car, it does not measure up to the luxury Infinity I-30.

First, the Infinity offers more leg room in the rear, added features like heated seats, and a awesome CD sound system.  In addition most of the features on the Infinity are standard equipment, while the Lexus requires various packages to be bought.  This adds to the price of the Lexus.  

Infinity offers more bang for the buck.  Priced around 30,000, the Infinity has more features than the Lexus ES-300 at a price of around 36,000.

I really like the drivers seat that automatically moves back to allow extra room to get out of the car.  The seat returns to the original position after starting the car.  Another nice feature is the rear sun shade that lifts and lowers with a touch of a button.  

Also another nice feature are the heated seats.  The Infinity offered the heated seats, but Lexus did not sell any cars in the Texas area with the heated seats.  For those of you that have not used heated seats, you are missing one of lives true joys on those cold winter days.  

Who should buy this car?  Anybody that wants a reliable, comfortable drive.  I would pick the Infinity I-30 over the Lexus ES - 300 any day of the week.    <br><br>
