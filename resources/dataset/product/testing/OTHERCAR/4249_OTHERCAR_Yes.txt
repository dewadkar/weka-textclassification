            I first bought my 318ti 1995. From the first moment I stepped on the BMW lot, I was impressed.  The BMW dealer was so friendly that I had to check and see if I was really talking to a dealer or not.

This is a very affordable BMW  It is extremely spacious, very sleek lines, and of course it carries with it the great history of quality associated with the BMW name.

It handles great, although my grandson says that the acceleration is a little weak due to the 4-cylinder engine. 

This car is equipped with all of the neat little gadgetry like the outdoor temperature, estimated driving miles remaining, and power everything.

The only drawback to owning a BMW is when it is maintenance time.  Most regular mechanics donï¿½t like to work on these cars and most dealers will rob you blind.  

Some car specifics:
- 1.9-liter DOHC four-cylinder engine 
- five-speed manual gearbox. 
- rear-wheel drive 
- hatchback coupe, with a rear seat that is big enough for two passengers in comfort. There is decent leg room for all four passengers, decent head room and decent shoulder room in what is essentially a compact coupe.
- The sound system is excellent

And be careful about letting your grandchildren drive it.  You may never get the car keys back.
