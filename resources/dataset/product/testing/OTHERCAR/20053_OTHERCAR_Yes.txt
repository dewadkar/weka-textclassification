            Ok i worked during the summer of 02 and i made some good money. I used half of my paycheck getting this one, now remember this is a more updated version. At first i gave it a ....damn did i make the wrong choice......i have to return and get my money back....it's kind of like a marriage thing...being unsure. But believe me! Having this day after day makes me appreciate it and love it even more. I wanted a new watch and I always go with CASIO. I really like how people think its a really cool g shock or dont know what it can do. When i say it's a camera watch they are like RIGHT?!!! or where do u take pictures. Once i showed it to several of my friends after i took a picture of them and they say it their face was SHOCKED i mean i even took pictures of them after! ITS REALLY FUNNY! it also has this COOL calender in it that looks like a real calender listing of ALL numbers of the MONTH and that day blinks! alarm,countdown feature, stopwatch. Ok I banged this thing more times than my senior ring but i'll tell u i was really worried it being scratched easily! How hilarious was that after SERIOUSLY 20 times dropping or banging it! And best of all it's waterproof! YES you can take pictures underwater and no it wont fry under it because it is a level 4 watch which means it could go scuba diving up to like 50 feet or something. REad the manual it states it. I even took pictures when i went to school field trips and such. Having mixed feelings? Here we go! For the next week or so PRETEND u had the watch and when something comes up where you wish you had a camera. write it down. If from the week you have over 10 reasons or so. THEN GET IT! Oh and battery life is excellent up to 6 months! and when u change the battery it wont delete your pictures! REALLY COOL! the screen seen at first is small but when u take a picture and download it, it expands it so it's more wider! HEY useful for taking pictures of that cool car or toy u want for christmas. Dont forget this watch is a james bond/ harriet the spy type thing! So if you think you candle the fame then GET IT!!! No light but it's made to be smaller so i doesnt use much of the battery life. I paid $200 but it came with the editing software and infared sensor to download pictures. NOT BAD!! HEY IT'S CHEAPER NOW! DAMN IT!
