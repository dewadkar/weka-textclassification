            This is my fourth Cadillac.  The first one we bought was a used two door coupe de ville.  It was great, but it was big.  Then we bought a 1984 coupe de ville.  I loved the new square style, but a two door car just wasn't the best for us, so we bought a 1986 de ville.  I just loved it.
It got good gas mileage on the highway and it was easy to drive.  So in 1994 we got another deville, with the new body style.  We have a 4.9L engine but did not get the northstar because the car had a stiffer ride and drive.  This one handled much better.
The car gets about 12 mpg around town, but on the highway it gets well over 24.  It has great pick-up and is very comfortable to ride in.
I still prefer the smaller version to drive myself, but as a passenger this one is more comfortable.
Mechanically there has only been one problem.  We had a broken motor mount which had to be replaced.  The car has less than 50,000 miles but it is almost 7 years old.
If you like a big comfortable car to travel on the highway you will be very happy with the Cadillac DeVille.<br><br>
