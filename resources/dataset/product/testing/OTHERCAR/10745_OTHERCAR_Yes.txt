            We selected the Mazda Tribute after looking the the CR-V, 4Runner, XTerra, and Explorer.  It is more than we ever imagined.  Our ES-V6 is smooth, has leather, plenty of room and fun to drive.  It doesn't look like it's out dated (a problem we had with the CR-V).  It's rounded edges, smooth curves and great acceleration are a hit with us.  For under $25000 this fully loaded vehicle is worth every penny.  
The Tribute's twin the Ford Escape lacked a little of the styling that the Tribute has.  Both vehicles are a good value and are hard to find in florida as they are selling as soon as they get on the Mazda lot. <br><br>
