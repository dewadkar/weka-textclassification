            NOTE: This is a 2003 model, the menu options on this review page only go up to 2002.

I am current leasing the Corolla S with manual transmission, but I love it so much that I plan on buying it once the lease is up.  Firstly, you have to admit that this car is a BIG leap from the past Toyota Corolla line.  The car is noticeably bigger on the inside and out, which is nice for a tall person like myself (I'm 6'2" tall). I previously drove a Chevy Prizm (basically the same car as the older Corolla model), and I couldn't ever fit my leg under the steering wheel.  With the Corolla S, the can be adjusted not only forward and back, but up and down which is nice.  No more leg-hitting-the-steering-wheel problems for tall folks!

I have one of the few manual transmission Corollas, but I have also test driven the automatic.  Both transmissions offer great pick-up...I have never had any trouble passing slow cars on the highway (I'm a bit of a lead foot).  The cruise control is also nice, it keeps me from speeding too much.  I don't know a whole lot about what's "under the hood," but I know that my Corolla gets great mileage-- I do lots of driving for my job.  I get about 36 mpg with local and highway driving, and about 41 mpg with all highway driving.  I stop at the gas station less than I did with my old Prizm, and the Prizm had a bigger tank.

This car is really turning some heads.  Recently I went to go pick up my brother at college, and while the car was parked next to a dorm, this girl came over to check out the car, yelling back to her friends "It's a Corolla!!"  My girlfriend's best friend even bought one, she loved it so much when I took her for a spin in mine.

The Corolla has a pretty good sound system, and other neat features like outdoor temperature gague, key-less entry, and a spacious center compartment to fit all of my CDs. It's truly a fun car to drive, I have no complaints except that the windshield wipers have only three speeds--it would be nice to have various intermittent wiper ranges, but this is not a big deal.

If anyone has seen the new Toyota Matrix, it's basically the same car, except the Corolla does not have the high trunk space like the Matrix.
