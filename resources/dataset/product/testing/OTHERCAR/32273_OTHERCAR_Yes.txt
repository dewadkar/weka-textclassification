            I've always loved photography but couldn't afford much in the way of a nice camera.  When my fiance decided it was time to upgrade his digital, I begged for the CoolPix 995.

We've had this camera two months and I've taken over 2000 shots with it.  The macro (closeup) capabilities are truly amazing.  You can zoom in on a flower and it even captures the details of the little hairs on the stem.

It takes great pictures if you leave it in automatic mode but when you get brave enough to flip to manual, that's when the fun really begins.  This thing has tons of adjustments that can be made.  Aperature, exposure, contrast, sharpness, ISO (film speed)... it's all there just waiting to be adjusted.  Don't worry about messing it up; there's a reset feature to take it back to factory default.  It will also hold the manual settings for more than one user.  That comes in handy when you want to macro bugs but your spouse prefers to capture sweeping landscapes.

There is quite a bit of lens noise as the camera tries to focus.  This is very apparent in dim light where it tries a little too hard to get the sharpest possible focus.  There's a popup flash if you need it.  I rarely use it because it tends to wash out the colors.  If I can't get the focus to lock where I want in dim light situations, I switch to manual focus.  I've read that the new flash design in the 995 is supposed to offer red eye reduction over previous models.  You couldn't prove that by me.  I've used the flash twice at night and both instances resulted in red eye.

There are very few things I don't like about this camera.  My biggest complaint being the auto-off feature.  It's default is 30 seconds and you have to poke around in a menu to increase that time.  I am a spur of the moment photographer and it's very aggravating to see a shot, reach down for the camera and find it's shut itself off.  There may be a way to make it remember your preference from one use to the next.  The manual that comes with it seems to be very informative.  I've just never taken the time to sit down and look through it.

Another annoyance is the lack of image stabilization that some cameras have.  I tend to shake a bit which blurs my macro shots if I'm not careful.  Because of the camera's unique design, you can't balance it on a solid surface.  The swivel lens side of it is much heavier than the other so it tips.  If you don't have a steady hand, a good tripod is recommended.  

Speaking of recommendations, you might want to consider getting the CoolPack II to go along with your new toy.  It includes a rugged carrying case, a set of four filters and a USB compact flash card reader.  I'd also recommend getting a bigger memory card.  We bought 128mb Viking compact flash card and an extra battery.  (Of course not everyone takes 1000 shots a month either.)  

As requested, these are the pertinent features that can be adjusted in manual mode:  white balance, metering, shot selector(which allows you to select single shots, continuous shots at varying rates of speed or make a 40 second movie without sound), best shot selector, image adjustment, saturation control, exposure settings, focus options, image sharpening, bracketing, and noise reduction.  The menu that controls all of these functions is very self explanatory if you're good at reading icons.  The ISO can be adjusted to 100, 200, 400, 800 or auto.  You can also adjust the monitor's brightness and contrast.  I'm sure there's more but I haven't read the manual that well.
