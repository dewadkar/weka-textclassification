            Not since the fun and anticipation of getting my grade school pictures taken have I had such a camera revelation.  If I had spent a little more time education myself about the Agfa ePhoto 1280 prior to purchasing it I think I might have been money ahead.  Somewhat inexpensive compared to others, it was an impulse but for me.  The picture view quality was good provided I was in the right ray of light or the camera was completely still.  The photo quality was not as good as I would have liked but I was able to download a couple of photo fixers that helped the quality.  Thinking that perhaps it was just my poor photography skills I took my camera to a professional photographer who had a virtually the same experience.  The camera is fine for basic, quick, shots but I would not recommend it for capturing your most treasured moments.  Customer service was fairly good though when I called with my concerns.  I received a packet on &quot;photo tips&quot;.  I think that the best bet when considering a digital camera is to read customer reviews.  If I would have read some of the reviews available on this camera, I would not have purchased it. <br><br>
