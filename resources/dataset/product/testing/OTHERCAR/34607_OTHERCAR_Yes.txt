            I purchased a 2001 GMC Yukon Denali and have the following feedback for potential purchasers.
The Yukon Denali has many selling points, a few of which include: Plenty of room, heated seats (front and rear), in-dash 6-disk CD changer; automatic headlamps. But, like most domestic vehicles, it required some improvements to make it suitable to my requirements.  The 16" Michelin radial tires were the first thing to go.  They were promptly replaced with 18" wheels and P285-18 Bridgestone Dueler HR tires.  Although Bridgestone has had some bad press as of late, these tires work quite well and are a quantum improvement over the soft Michelins.  One other gripe in the tire department is that the full size spare tire is made by Firestone.  Who knows if it will actually work when it is needed.
The new tires and wheels integrate quite nicely with the electronically controlled suspension which is standard on the Denali.  Exit ramps approached at 50MPH produced no tire squeal (quite impressive for a 5500 lb vehicle).
The highway ride is as smooth as any passenger car that I have ever driven (I traded a 1998 Mercedes Benz in on this vehicle) and the only real downside to highway travel is the fuel economy (avg 15 MPG).  Throttle response is excellent and with 320 HP on tap, passing is not a problem.  The interior noise level is extremely quiet and very comfortable.  The factory exhaust system uses dual catalytic converters and is a true dual exhaust all the way back to the single tailpipe.  External exhaust note is throaty but not annoyingly loud.
I only had a couple of minor Quality Assurance issues when I purchased the vehicle.  The first was an out-of-calibration thermostatic sensor which resulted in no hot or cold ventilation in the vehicle.  This was promptly repaired by the dealer, although it was quite annoying.  The other issue was a trim piece on the door unlocking mechanism that was damaged during assembly and popped out whenever the driver's door was unlocked.
Vehicle fit and finish are above par and shows considerabe improvement over the last GM product which I owned (1995 Impala SS).
Overall, I am quite happy with this vehicle and although the initial quality issues were annoying, I feel that I made a good overall investment.
