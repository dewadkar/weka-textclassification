            The new Boxster S is a real piece of art. The S model has 250 hp and for around 50k this car is your best bet for fast cars at a low price. You have to admire the body design and the 3.2 liter engine. The reason the car is called a Boxster is because of the way the rear engine is designed. The cylinders are organized in a box like setting in the rear which also adds to the Porsche masterpiece. The car really does fly going from 0-60 mph in 5.9 seconds. This is especially impressive because in todays market it is hard to find a new car that goes 0-60 in under 6 seconds for a low price. The reason for the great acceleration is because of its light weight at 2855 lbs. The new six-speed gearbox is also nice with short throws between gears and nice clutch. The new S also comes in an optional 5 speed tiptronic version. The car be surely appreciated from a distance but to appreciate the power Porsche has given it you have to drive it yourself. All the S models come in a convertible and it converts form closed to open in less than 12 seconds. With the top down and wind in your face at high speeds you will not be able to resist the car. The Boxster also has its trademark exhaust in the middle rear along with optional 18&quot; rims. The big tires really give the car the traction it needs for its power. The rear tires are 265/35 and the fronts are 225/40 on the optional package. I really can not find any drawbacks to the car except that it is a two-seater, this car is for the speed demons and quality goers because of the cars great design. <br><br>
