            I was initially attracted to the Coolpix 885 for its small size. I wanted something I could keep in a winter jacket pocket or a purse, but did not want to have to choose between size and quality. When I first held the camera in my hands, immediately it felt right. The grip on this camera is excellent. Some smaller digital cameras have awkward handling to them, and can cause one to move when a picture is being taken. With the Coolpix 885, this is not a problem. However, I will note that if you have extraordinarily large hands, this camera may not be the best choice for you.

The next thing I noticed when testing it out at the store was the expansive yet easy to read and shift through menu. With this camera there is really no need to read the manual- figuring it out was a snap; as though those who designed this were thinking in terms of human intuition. As for taking pictures, there are multiple options for multiple settings, from indoor modes to black and white, to special settings for snow landscapes and sunsets. Also included is a movie mode, which enables you to record up to 40 second clips of video footage. Unfortunately, there is no sound. I find myself using this option often, and sound would be beneficial.

This picture takes GREAT outdoor shots. However, indoors when there is awkward lighting, the pictures don't come out nearly as crisp or accurate. One bothersome quality of this camera is that the flash drains out people's faces. I've even taken a picture in a completely dark room, to find that the picture taken looks like the lights were on. I believe this is a common problem with digital cameras. Overall though, you can tweak the settings to get your pictures just right.

One added bonus with this camera is that it comes with a battery and charger. This is an excellent deal, and means you don't have to go out and buy them separately (meaning, cost you more money). I also really enjoy using the software that comes with it to view the pictures. Uploading photos is incredibly easy. You just hook up the camera and click a button. 

This is my first digital camera, and I am quite pleased with the quality. If I had to do it over again, I would have bought it sooner.
