            You know, probably around 90% of the reviews you'll ever read about a vehicle on the net are by people who aren't happy with their purchase.  If you don't have problems, you don't go shouting to everyone.

Anyways, I was in an accident and was forced to find a new car to buy.  My last car was a '95 GrandAm 4dr.  I always take care of my cars and AM mechanically inclined, or I guess you could say I have common sense, which isn't so common anymore I'm finding.

Well, I got a '97 Sunfire 2dr convertible with all the options available and a 5 speed manual transmission, which is much better in my opinion.  I always research a purchase thoroughly and found that buying a Sunfire with the 2.2 ltr engine is definitely not something you'd want to do.  It gets better gas mileage from what I've read but is of much less quality.  The 2.4 has quite a bit of get-up-and-go.

I bought this car based on the fact that the previous owner is cut from the same cloth as I am.  They performed all the maintenance on this car, oil changes etc., regularly and documented it too.  This car had 68,000 miles on it when I bought it and it's still like new.

The window motors in Pontiacs ALWAYS have to be replaced.  They are of poor quality and don't last long.  The gas cap also rattled when I got the car and had to quickly be fixed lest I get a "Telltale Heart" mania or something.  Other than the gas cap, the car interior is quiet and the road noise is very acceptable.

Engine accessibility is big for me and you can actually perform your own mx on this engine without tons of special tools or tearing the entire engine apart to change the serpentine belt or other common mx items.

Anyone who doesn't know how to take care of a car shouldn't be writing reviews.  Cars will NOT last 100,000 miles if you don't take care of it (at least not American hehe).  I also have a '93 Ford Explorer with 168,000 miles that is like new because I take care of it.
