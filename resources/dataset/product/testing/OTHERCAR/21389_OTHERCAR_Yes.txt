            The 1999 Toyota Camry is the best car I have ever owned.  It's probably the most dependable car on the market. To this day, I have not had a problem with it.  It's a great family car too.  With room for five passengers, everyone can sit comfortably.  Or even sleep for that matter. The ride is smooth enough to lull you like a baby. It's very fuel efficient, roughly 20 city miles and 28 highway miles to the gallon.  In addition to these features, it has a large trunk, big enough to fit three people (trust me on this one folks).  This car is an excellent buy and one of the best all around vehicles. I would highly recommend this automobile to anyone in the market for a new car.
