            -Why did I buy this product?
The company I used to work for has many cameras from different maker.  The value and performance of Olympus cameras stand out from most of the others.  When I was looking for a digicam for myself, logically, Olympus is my first choice.

-Describe my experience using this product.
The performance of the camera is outstanding.  The images it produces are crisp and sharp regardless the quality level setting.  However, when I tried to do a close up shoot on a small item, the image isn't clear.  I tried the special setting on the camera as Olympus suggested.  The result is a bit better.  

-Summary
This is a product for whoever is looking for a affordable digicam with professional grade performance.  <br><br>
