            Why do I love Hondas??? What's not to love!  I feel like it was custom made for me. I bought my first Honda new in 1988 (see CRX review) and that was &quot;IT&quot; for me.  I finally found the car that fit me like a glove. The seats are comfortable, everything is in reach. (I am female 5'6&quot;).  I feel safe and secure. I know my Honda will be dependable.  The front wheel drive will always get me through.Sure it sits low to the ground and that could be a bit of a problem for most vehicles, but the Honda always takes it and asks for more.  When I outgrew the CRX and needed a wagon, I bought my current 1991 Accord EX used. It's even fancier than the CRX. Lots of everything.  Power windows, moon roof, cruise and plenty of room for shopping bags. I love the hatchback, it's wonderful to just pop it open and store your packages and go.  Ok, what could they improve on...It's a little difficult to see out the back when backing up and parts are a bit expensive. But normally I go forward and the Honda doesn't need service very often, so I'm still saving money in the long run. It handles great and really has good pick up for a four cylinder.  I plan on always buying Hondas!<br><br>
