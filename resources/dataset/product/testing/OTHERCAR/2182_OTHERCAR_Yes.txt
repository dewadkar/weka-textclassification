            I have been very happy with my Corolla because it is a trouble-free, dependable car that is fun to drive.  I am a smaller person, and find the Corolla easier to control than larger autos.  It also provides clear visibility and has dashboard controls that are within easy reach.  The fold-down backseats and height-adjustable seatbelts are additional features that make this a versatile car for families.

My Corolla performs well on long trips, and gets very good gas mileage in general.  The only complaint I have about my Corolla is that it is generally slow to accelerate, which can create difficulty when merging into traffic at high speeds.  I have learned how to deal with this, but it took some getting used to since I had previously driven more powerful cars.<br><br>
