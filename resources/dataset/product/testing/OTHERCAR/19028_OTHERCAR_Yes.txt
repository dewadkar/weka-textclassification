            I bought this camera three weeks ago after very extensive researching on the Internet. It has lived up to my expectations and more. The quality of the photos it takes is superlative and for the first time ever I find that there is no trace of disappointment in my purchase. It slips into your hand like a glove and all the controls are convenient and well-placed. You can be up and shooting within a few minutes of getting the camera but it takes quite a while to learn how to utilise all its facilities. As much as I adore the camera I must admit that the Manual is dreadful. It lacks clear diagrams and the explanations are so brief as to be almost non-existant. Most of the instructions are there but it is so hard to find them. Also the Icons displayed on the camera are too small to see (for an old guy like me) and far from intuative. What a let-down from Olympus for such a great product.
I like the telephoto facility and the close-up capability is very good (although I purchased the optional Close-up / wide-angle lens to get those extreme close-ups, which incidently are crystal clear.
Downside, well there's that manual and the lens-cap which is a pain to store while you use the camera. Also it doesnt get 'popped-off' like the Nikon but it does stop the camera from working (and produce some nasty noises). I also purchased a Smart-Media reader but that doesnt work for the 64 Mb card. Best to try it out in the shop before you leave. I didn't try till the card was full and then had to use a normal Serial download of two hours plus! The software which comes with the camera is good ...once you can work out how to use it! and I got given two versions of the Camedia software without any explanation as to which to use. Small points but they niggle.
All my friends have been REALLY impressed with the quality of the prints (even at A4 size) they are really up to professional standards.
So, all in all, ABSOLUTELY thrilled with the camera but why is it let down by that instruction manual. Would I recommend it.  Absolutely!
