            I have owned my 93 J30t since I learned to drive, actually a little before its the car I took my test in.  

I will keep my J30 until it falls apart.. which could probably be forever given the reliability to date.  I do my own oil changes every 3k miles and all other routine maintenance, it has only been to the shop once for a timing belt.  I have 120,000 miles on the clock and have no reason to doubt I could get another 120,000 more...

The car's performance is excellent and after spending a few hundred dollars at Jim Wolf Technology (www.jimwolftechnology.com) is even better with a high flow air intake and upgraded computer chip which has boosted the HP by about 30 or so.  My car now beats most other four doors on the road and even gives a few sportier cars a good run for their money :)

The main caveat for this car is the same as for any rear wheel drive car, take it easy on slippery surfaces... the back end is fairly light and the car needs to be handled with finesse.

My friend relatives from europe (where the J30 is not available) always beg me to drive it and have all made me offers to take mine back home with them.

The J30 owes a lot of it's performance and handling to the 300zx which has the same engine (normally aspirated) and handling systems such as the four wheel HICAS steering system.  

Nissan/Infiniti made a big mistake taking this car off the market (as they did with the 300zx) let's hope it's successor due out next year is as much as a success. <br><br>
