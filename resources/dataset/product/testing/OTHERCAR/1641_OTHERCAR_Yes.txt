            Being a sophomore in high school (last year, the year of my purchase), my parents needed to buy me a reliable car for school and work.  My brother, an experience mechanic (for ten years) and truly respected, owned a white 96 Geo Prism.  Nean has never had to fix anything major on that car, which has survived four years of use and the beat-around of two children.  He loves his car, and wouldn't trade it in for anything!  My parents, while car hunting, took my car interests and my brother's car experience into play.  In an instant, Nean recommended the prism.  So, sure enough, about a week later my parents drove home in a sky blue 96 Geo Prism.  My car.  And I must say, after another 10,000 miles added to the 40,000 miles previously applied, my car is still running in great condition!  It's roomy, drives supersmooth, and perfect for me.  The ONLY flaw in the Geo Prism is that the air condition knob fell off on me (just once, wasn't life threatening though)and the vents sometime get loosened up where you need to put a small piece of cardboard in it to face where you want it to.  Those are the only flaws--small but simple to live and adjust to.  For a first car, I definately recommend this car, both from a student's point of view, AND a mechanic's!  <br><br>
