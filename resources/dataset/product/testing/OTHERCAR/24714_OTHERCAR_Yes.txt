            After months of research, asking opinions and reading reviews, I finally made the decision on the Sony DSC-S70 for my first digital camera purchase.  I am very happy with this purchase.  First, it is extremely easy to use.  After the initial charge of the battery, I was snapping pictures and using many of the features of the camera--without hardly having to reference the user manual.  The on-camera menus are very user-friendly.

Things I really like:  1) The LCD screen on the back seems to be very high quality. 2) The infoLITHIUM battery system is a great concept by Sony.  3) Easy photo/movie review--to decide to keep or delete. 4) Very easy connection to my PC via USB--worked on first try.  5) Overall, as already stated--a VERY easy to use camera.

Things I wish were different:  1) More optical zoom.  2) That it came with a 32MB or 64MB Memory Stick--the 8MB Memory Stick provided is a waste of time.  I immediately purchased a 64MB Memory Stick.  3) The camera requires that the lens cover be removed BEFORE the camera is turned on--otherwise you run the risk of damaging the zoom lens.  While this is only an inconvenience, it is a bit troubling that the thing used to protect the lens can also damage the camera!

As I've read from other people's experiences, I ended up spending around another $400 in accessories--the 64MB Memory Stick, Accessory Kit (bag, extra battery and another 8MB Memory Stick), Lens Filters &amp; required adapter.<br><br>
