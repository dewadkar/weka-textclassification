<TEXT>
            I purchased a Saturn for my wife because she wanted something sporty after years in the stationwagon set. I had heard good things about Saturns, but thought it was only hype. This is the best car I have ever owned. It is Zippy, responsive, good on gas and a pleasure to drive! The only negative thing I can think of to say is the drivers seat wore out and broke half way up the back. Even after 170,000 miles this car did not burn or leak any oil. The best thing about this car is the fact that my wife loves it and pleasing her is more important to me than anything else.<br><br>
