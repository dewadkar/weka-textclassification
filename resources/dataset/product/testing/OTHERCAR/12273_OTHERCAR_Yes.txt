            This is a great truck if you are looking for simple, low maintenance transportation. I bought the truck in 1995 with 24,000 miles on it for $8800 and have put 60,000 miles on it since then. Mine is a very stripped-down 2 wheel drive model. It's my primary transportation and I plan on driving it until it don't drive no more!!

If you don't need a luxurious ride and want something versatile to haul around work or non-work items, you may be well served by a basic Nissan, especially if you can find one used.

Pros:
- low maintenance: I change the oil and get it tuned up on an irregular basis; I have had the alignment adjusted twice; other than that, all other work has been some minor body work and new tires 
- versatile: I have a RackIt-style ladder rack and a bed liner, which allows me to haul anything with minimal worries
- easy to get repaired

Cons:
- steering: no power steering and for some people this truck has pretty strenuous manual steering
- rear-wheel drive: like any light, rear-wheel drive truck, you need to be very conscious of skidding around. If you are going to be driving in frequently-wet conditions, you need good tires. If snow, you need chains.
- seats: my truck doesn't have bucket seats - it has a bench seat. It also doesn't have much legroom - I am 5'10 and have the seat all the way back
- loud: this is not a quiet, well-insulated interior
- paint: it scratches easily<br><br>
