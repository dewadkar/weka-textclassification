            After 10 whole years, my friend's 1990 Acura Legend is still good and running.  It hasn't died yet, and probably won't for years to come.  So on to the specifics...

Even after all those years, the Legend still has excellent handling and performance.  Though not as efficient as more recent models, the Legend still gets some good mileage.  There is some body roll around really tight curves, and it may make some a bit sick, but to others without motion sickness it won't be noticeable.  The Legend has good acceleration; competitive enough to survive the freeways and on-ramps against newer cars.  But then Acura has <b>always</b> made good cars!  So you shouldn't be surprised, huh?

The Legend has excellent reliability as well.  It's had to deal with hauling computers, soccer and baseball games, golf practices, break-ins, and Mexico road trips over the years, yet keeps on going!  Oh boy!  There is some noticeable wear and tear one places the arm rests and seat covers; but then again my treats it pretty roughly.  Overall, the Legend has held up very well through all the abuse.

The seats are comfortable, as well.  The back row of seats might be cramped for taller adults, though, in the leg room.  And the ride is still very quiet, with minimal wind noise, rattling, etc.  There is also a fair amount of trunk space.  It's about enough to fit two golf bags, a bag of soccer equipment, or multiple computer monitors.  A nice sized truck, wouldn't you say?

So if you're in the market for a used car, consider the 1990 Acura Legend.  With excellent reliability and durability, legendary Acura performance (no pun intended!) and ample passenger comfort, it's a good bang for the buck.<br><br>
