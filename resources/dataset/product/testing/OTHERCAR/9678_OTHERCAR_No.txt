            I bought a 1997 Dodge Neon Coupe a week after my Sundance was totaled 1/23/97.  I was please with the Sundance so purchased the Neon, which had lots of eye appeal and was quite roomy.  It performed quite well and is fine for my driving needs.  Two months after the 3 year warranty expired I noticed the oil light came on.  When I checked it nothing showed on the dip stick.  After adding a quart it barely registered, so I put in a second quart and drove it to Jiffy-Lube.  They changed oil &amp; said to take it in for service. Diagnosis was need to replace Head Gasket ($900) since warranty had expired.  The car had just 35,200 miles of careful driving, and it had never dawned on me to check the oil regularly on a low-mileage car.  

I've learned since that Head Gaskets have been a problem, and wish I'd come to this forum much sooner.  There are several stories here about the Head Gasket problem, which seems to be chronic with the 1997 Neons per some independent mechanics I've contacted since.  No matter how happy you may be with your Neon, whether purchased new or used, make it a point to check the oil at least once a month, particularly when you are getting close to warranty expiration. It would definitely pay to get an extended warranty for a Neon.  Wish I had!! <br><br>
