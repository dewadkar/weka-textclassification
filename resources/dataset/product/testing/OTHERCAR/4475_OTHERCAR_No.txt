            We bought our ML320 in 1998. We owned several Mercedes and still own a '94 E320 Convertible. We trusted in M-B quality and therefore ordered the ML320 fully equipped without having seen it.

When we got the car the first impression was that the quality was much lower than we expected from a 50000$ car.
The doors sounded like being made of very thin metal not like usual M-B doors. The headlights were made from plastic. The interior (sand color) looked pretty cheap. The dashboard looked like plastic. The leather seats were not very comfortable (you slide easily) and the quality &amp; thickness of the leather was not comparable to other Mercedes cars.

The only nice thing was that the car rides smoother than other SUV's/4-wheels like Grand Cherokee or Range Rover.

Than came the winter and we experienced further problems. The heating was not able to heat the car so that my feet became icecubes at outside temperatures below -10 degrees Celsius. Also the heated seats took about 10 minutes to become heated comfortably. In winter when you have covered the car with snow the construction of the doors does not let you open them without having a major avalanche in the car. The wipers are also low quality and very noisy. I don't understand why M-B invested a bunch of money in the development of the excellent center wiper used in all  most of the other models and why they don't build it into the ML 320.

The following spring we decided to have a hook installed at the rear of the car to be able to haul our Jetski around. When we got the car back we discovered that we could not open the spare wheel holder and thus the trunk of the car.

After all of this hassle and the message from M-B that this was not their problem we decided to sell the car and bought a Grand Cherokee which is in our opinion the better value and quality.
