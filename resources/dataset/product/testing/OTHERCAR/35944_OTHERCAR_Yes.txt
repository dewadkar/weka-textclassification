            If you are looking for luxury with a sporty feel for a price under $10,000
then the Infinity G20 is your car.  I've owned my '95 G20 for close to 3 years without any engine malfunctions what-so-ever.  With 65,000 miles now I still recieve comments on how new the car drives when I let friends take it for a spin.  Many people I talk to think my car cost a good $20,000 because of the 2-tone leather interior and moonroof.  The exterior is well commented as well.  My good friend Ronnie thought my car was a '98.  I know people with new Hondas and Toyotas that already need a new part under the hood.  You WON'T have this problem with an Infinity (even 5 years old). If I can give any advice to one looking for a car for UNDER $10,000 is that there is no better way to get MORE than your moneys worth than to own an Infiniti G20.<br><br>
