            I have owned the Jeep Grand Cherokee for four years now and it has been a marvelous machine.  It looks great and rides quite well.  I have been extremely pleased.  I bought this vehicle because it was the best looking mid-size sport utility I could find.  I looked very carefully at the 4Runner but decided that it just didn�t have enough power.  Even the optional V6 couldn�t hang with the standard I6 in the Jeep.  I have been nothing but pleased.

The 4WD system has been flawless.  They say that you can leave it in 4WD all the time (which you can), but it does affect the gas mileage.  It handles like a dream off road and in the snow.

It has an Infinity Gold sound system that is absolutely fabulous.  It is probably one of the best stereo systems that I have ever come into contact with.  The leather seats have held their good looks and comfort for  the life of the vehicle.

I recently had some major tuning and maintenance done (about $600) b/c it has 57K miles.  It was running a little rough.  Presto!  I have a brand new car.  This thing runs great�maybe even better than when I bought it.

The biggest complaint I have is that the gas mileage isn�t too good with 6 cylinder.  On the highway is great, but the city mileage stinks.

As an aside, I have spent some time in a 5.9Limited.  Let me tell you, briefly, that if you care to shell out the dough, this is a rocket.  It was documented as the fastest sport utility on the road (stock, of course).  Handles like a dream.  I really wish that they would bring it back. 

This is great for anyone that wants something bigger than a car, but not a truck.  It has great towing ability.  Elegant enough that a soccer mom can enjoy it.<br><br>
