            My folks bought a 2000 Durango SLT used for 19,200 about a year and half ago. It is a beautiful red and it is a very attractive SUV overall. 

Engine: SLT comes with a very powerful 5.9L V-8 style engine that has power throughout all RPM ranges. It tows like a rig much bigger than it and cruises at 80 mph at about 2200 rpms easy. Average gas mileage for an 8 cylinder engine. 20-30 mpg I would say. 

Exterior: very nice curves overall. Not boxy like most SUV and trucks. SLT comes with aluminum body\bumpers. Lower fog lights to go along with large powerful headlamps.

Interior: Very comfortable overall. Plenty of legroom for 4 adults, additional seat in back makes 6 if needed. SLT comes with very nice leather. All creature comforts you would expect. A/C heats up and cools down very fast thanks to very powerful fan. Drivers console ergonomic w\ Tach, Speed, etc. Adjustable steering wheel. Drivers seat powered. 

This car handles very well, turns on a dime as they say. It really hugs the road thanks to a very wide stance for a compact class SUV. It cruises as smooth as any minivan on the open freeway. On the flip side, 4x4 with the big mill under the hood makes this rig as much of an off-road vehicle as any Jeep SUV. This rig has tons of ground clearance to add to that.

This SUV is perfect for a small family who needs 4x4 ability but want something that can also cruise for road trips. A very comfortable interior with a very powerful engine makes for a wonderful ride. For the guys, this rig is a beast, a compact SUV with a king size V8. For the ladies, this is a comfortable, safe SUV that can handle rain, snow, whatever you can throw at it, with plenty of storage space with the third seat folded down.

Stock sound system has plenty of thump for 99% of music listeners.
