            The Minolta Dimage 7 is so far the best camera I have ever used.  Having a Minolta 35mm camera in the past, this was very easy to get used to.  There are two sides to the camera, Beginner and Professional. One side is the camera has automatic exposure and presets for certain events (i.e.: sunsets and sporting events) which helps if you are new to photography. The other is filled with rich features, such as Shutter Speed, White Balance, and Color Balance.  The camera also has 3 types of flash modes, standard flash, red-eye reduction, and rear flash sync.

The resolution has to be the best thing about the camera.  It has an astounding resolution of 2560 x 1920 at its maximum image size.  Along with the resolution you can control the image quality.  Here are the modes of compression for the image quality, all file sizes are for the resolution 2560 x 1920: RAW mode, has to be downloaded through the camera for decoding, this mode gives you the best quality at 9.5mb per picture on the card before decoding, RAW is only saved as a TIFF after it has been decoded.  Next is Super Fine mode, which can be saved at 14.1mb per photo, this is saved in a JPG image format.  FINE mode, can be saved at 2.1mb per picture, this too is saved as a JPG.  Standard mode can be saved at 1.1mb per picture and this too is saved in a JPG format.  Last, Economy mode, which can be saved at 0.65mb per image and is saved in a JPG format.  Since when you buy the camera they give you a 16mb compact flash card, I would recommend putting the images at 2560 x 1920 and Standard mode for the compression.  I have a 256mb compact card which I bought additionally, can hold about 227 images at 2560 x 1920 with Standard mode compression.  Why don�t I use a better image quality since I have a big card you may ask?  I do not see a difference in the photos.  With Fine mode and a resolution of 2560 x 1920 I only got 125 images to the 256mb card.  I compared photographs taken of the same object at different image qualities and they looked the same.  If you really think about it, you�re only going to reduce the image anyway when you send it in an email or put it up on a website.  As you reduce the image on the computer from the original 2560 x 1920, you will see it will get sharper.  Printing from the original image size you will see amazing results.  You figure every 100 pixels equals 1 inch, so the original image if you brought it to a print shop, while maintaining the same image quality with out enlarging it would be around 25� x 19�.

The battery life is okay.  On 4 alkaline batteries it lasts about 5 pictures.  With the Ni-MH batteries, which the camera recommends, can last anywhere from 10 photos to 50 photos.  Depending on how much you use the zoom, focus and macro mode.

The Minolta Dimage 7 has to be the best camera I have ever owned.  It has a Beginner�s side and a Professional�s wanting.  I would highly recommend this camera who Is getting started in photography and any professional that wants a inexpensive camera that is loaded with features.
