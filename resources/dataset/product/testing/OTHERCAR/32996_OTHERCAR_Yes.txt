            First off, mcaswell did a great review on this camera - and there's no point in repeating what was said. While I'm at it balidoy was unhappy with focus - I have had no such problems and possibly this is a misplaced 7 (not 7i) review?

Secondly, for a community of users, go to the "Unofficial Moderated Minolta Digital Camera Forum" here: http://www.network54.com/Hide/Forum/151930
If you rely on dpreview, they will steer you away from this camera because the neck strap ring gets in the way of the compact flash door. Hunh? This is only a problem if you have mounted the split rings but don't have a neck strap on - means this is a review from someone who's either just fiddled with the camera, or who is desperate for find a flaw.

So far I've taken about 2500 photos with this camera and am still learning. There are *lots* of features, including things you'd expect only on pro cameras (bracketing 4 kinds of settings, for instance) and things you'd only expect on a consumer level camera (for instance big square 'P' button on top that puts the camera in "point and shoot" mode - so you can quickly hand the camera to someone else).
Once you've learned it, the user interface is a delight.
Zoom and focus (if you're using manual focus) are just where you'd expect it (if you learned on SLRs). More importantly, most of the adjustments are on separate buttons knobs and wheels. If the buttons are at all close, they have different shapes so you can 'feel' them in the dark.
Battery life is not great, but OK. Batteries last *much* longer if you leave the LCD view panel off and viewfinder in "auto" mode (only comes on if your eye (or thumb) is within an inch or so. Remember that these are AA NiMh batteries - add'l sets of 4 are only $15 or so (see http://thomas-distributing.com/batteries.htm ) and 4 additional AA batteries are pretty light in the camera bag. A "wall wart" style charger (which works fine) comes in the box, but I'd suggest also getting a Maha C204F charger which can sit on your desk, or, if you're on the road, runs on 12VDC.
Finally - beware unscrupulous web-camera-dealers. IMHO, best summed up here :http://webpages.charter.net/bbiggers/DCExperiments/html/buying.html
