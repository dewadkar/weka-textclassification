            I do like my Audi very much...however, after owning 5 Hondas from the Civic to the Prelude, I have to say that the Audi isn't as wonderful as everyone professes. I have a 1999 Audi 1.8T A4, without Quattro. Key benefits include:

* Great price on a smaller, entry level luxury sedan.
* Great looks.
* Solid, tight feel.
* Fairly good ride/handling tradeoff.
* Phenomenal electronic controls - climate control, audio system, electric windows, sunroof, etc.
* Reliable engine.

Some *gasp* negatives I experienced with mine:

* Wind whistling noise in the driver's side door that the dealership cannot seem to fix
* A rattle coming from the back end of the car
* Lag between pushing the accelerator and the engine engaging (turbo lag? tiptronic lag?)

I admit, my expectations are very high, but then again, should a 28,000 car really have wind noise in the door? Especially when it is touted as a marvel of German engineering? Like I said in the title, it's the little things that add up over time. Hate to say it, but my first car - a $7400 Honda CRX - had none of the wind whistling or the rattles that my $28K Audi does. 

All in all, it's a very good car. Tiptronic seems to be more of a marketing tool than something I actually use. I can imagine there are a few leather glove wearing speed demons out there that love playing with the Tiptronic, but after about a week, I found I prefer to rely on the Automatic transmission.

When you test drive, listen for rattles and wind noise...I don't remember any in my test drive, however...
