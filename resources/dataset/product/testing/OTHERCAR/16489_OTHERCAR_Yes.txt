            I am the guy who swore he never, EVER would own a minivan.  We spent months looking at SUV's that would seat 7 in comfort, had 4WD and got good gas mileage. Bottom line: my wife decided the Silhouette was the right choice and I could not be happier.  We purchased our 2002 Silhouette the end of June 2002 and have been driving it for 6 months now. The exterior is sharper looking than most vans and the redesigned front end was definately a big plus. The interior is very spacious, and the fold down third row seat is a dream.  There is even a little bit of conceled "trap door" storage between the rear hatch and the back of the third row seat for jumper cables, bungee cords, clothes etc.   We opted for the Premier package only because I had a lot of GM Mastercard points saved, otherwise we probably would've bought an aftermarket DVD system and had it professionally installed for less money than the $1,500 Premier package upgrade. We are averaging 20 mpg on mostly rural roads, although we did drive it to Maine for 8 hours this summer which averaged approx 23 mpg highway.

I am a gadget geek and this van has lots of cool gizmos to keep me happy including ones I never thought I would use like the heated seats and built-in "hands free" voice activated cell phone.  The remote controlled power sliding side doors are a super feature when you have children.  There are even buttons on both inside door frames that allow the kids to open and close the doors themselves.

The only downside to all the tech toys is that there is more opportunity for something to stop working.  For example, the Onstar system stopped working (this was apparently an Onstar problem not a Silhouette problem to be fair, but it still required a trip to the dealer), heated drivers seat system had to be replaced, power door on passenger side would not open at random times, power locks on passenger side stopped working after a trip to have the Onstar system fixed (the repairmen said it was a pinched wire caused by them replaceing the door panel but nonetheless required another trip to be fixed.)  All told I have had the van in to be serviced five times, all minor issues and all fixed free under warranty but still a drag.

I don't want to give anyone the impression that the minor service issues outweight the overall VERY positive experience we have had for six months now.  The car is fantastic and we would definately make the same choice even now that the "new car honeymoon" is over.
