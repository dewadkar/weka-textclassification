            This is the premier truck Mazda sells, and owning one I know why.  This machine handles beautifully, and has all the option you should expect in this price range.  The interior is comfortable and roomy, and the controls are easily reached.  The 4X4 model, which I have, handles snow extremely well for a pickup truck.  You just have to remember it is not an SUV, but a pickup.  The only drawback to this vehicle would be the gas mileage, which is not that great - about 17 miles to the gallon highway.<br><br>
