            In the summer of 1999, my wife and I decided to replace our aging 91 Nissan Sentra with another small car (used) that I could use for commuting to work. The 98 Passat we own was to become the 'family' car that she totes the kid around in.  On the 4th of July weekend of 99 I saw an ad for a 98 Golf GL for sale with 24,000 miles for $12,800. I immediately went over, test drove it, and fifteen minutes later bought it for $11,200 (the owner had already bought his new car - a beautiful Audi A4 1.8T Quattro) and just wanted to get rid of the Golf payment, so he sold it to us for the outstanding loan balance.

I have since put another 20,000 miles on the car, WITH NOT ONE SINGLE PROBLEM! This car has been absolutely TROUBLE-FREE since I picked it up, and I put a good amount of miles on the car every day (60 mile round trip commute). The car is rock solid (if a bit noisy) at speeds over 70mph, and although a bit slow off the line, is very torquey in all gears for around town driving.

I consistently get around 30 mpg on regular unleaded, the standard 6-speaker stereo sounds good, and the hatch back provides enormous cargo carrying flexibility. For example, when my wife and I went baby furniture shopping, we took the Golf. We bought a full size glider, ottoman, and one of those fancy strollers, and we got EVERYTHING into the back of the Golf!!

The paint still looks great, the interior is holding up very well, and as I said, mechanically the car has been perfect. I take good care of it; I use the dealer for all factory scheduled maintenance, and I DO NOT use Jiffy Lube every 3000 miles (which in my opinion is a GIANT SCAM perpetrated on a largely naive American motoring public. The vehicle MANUFACTURER knows what is best for their vehicles, and with the advances in motor oil composition and engine management, the need to replace the oil so frequently is suspect at best. But I digress...)

I consider the Golf the PERFECT 'second' car for a family, or a great college car. Versatile, fun to drive, and reliable (the 2.0 engine has been in production for something like 5 years - and it's become pretty bullet proof).

As my wife and I consider the purchase of a new minivan for our growing family, we need to decide which VW to get rid of. The 98 Passat, which has had its share of problems but is an emotional favorite of mine and is highly refined, or the Golf, which is basic transportation at its best and a solid commuter car.

BTW...if you're wondering why I said SUV in the heading, I consider the Golf to be a real <b>"Sporty Utility Vehicle"</b>!!
