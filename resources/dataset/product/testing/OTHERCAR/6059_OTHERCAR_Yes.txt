            The Olympus C-740 is my first digital camera and I absolutely love it!  My main reason for purchasing this camera was because of it's optical zoom capability.  Olympus has everyone beat at the moment in zoom.  I had originally intended to purchase the C-750 but the salesperson talked me out of it.  Indeed he was right, the C-740 takes awesome pictures up to 8x10 by itself and with the right software(Genuine Fractals) you can go as large as you want.

I have been using the camera primarily for outdoor shots, particularly wildlife since I am a birder.  I have been very impressed with the capabilities of the camera.  Zoom and macro have been fabulous!  At full optical zoom a tripod is very helpful for taking clear shots.  I don't recommend using the digital zoom if you want clear shots because I found that the images were not as sharp using the digital zoom.  I have used the macro to photograph lichens, new hatchlings in nests, etc. and it works great.

I have experimented a little bit with the user settings and found I could set four different user settings that has been useful.  I really like the feature of being able to manually adjust shutter speed, film speed and aperture size to take night photos.  Moonlight is too bright for the pre-programmed settings!  I have also used the panorama mode on the camera and the results are wonderful.

Now, the camera will eat batteries quickly if you use the lcd a lot.  I found that with the 4 AA rechargables I can go for one morning birding session before I have to recharge.  The disposable lithium batteries that come with the camera are amazing!  They are expensive ($24 list) but they have lasted for many mornings of birding and are still going strong.

Now for the real bummer-I absolutely love this camera, but the other day it died on me.  I have only had the camera for two months and I have taken very good care of it.  I thought it was the batteries, but no.  I bought mine from the local camera shop and perhaps paid a little more, but they were great about taking care of getting it repaired under warranty.  I asked around and I have not found that these cameras have problems, so make what you will of it.  I will update this review once I get the camera back in working order.

UPDATE!!!!  Well, I finally got my camera back and it seems to be working fine.  It took SIX weeks though.  This is unacceptable customer service in my mind.  For this very reason, I am not sure that I would ever buy an Olympus product again.  Buyers beware!
