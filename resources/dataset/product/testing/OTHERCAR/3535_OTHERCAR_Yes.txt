               I got the HP Photosmart 315 digital camera as a Christmas gift this year from my wife. She let me have it early so I could capture the holiday  season's activities. Right out of the box, I found it very user friendly. I didn't even have to look at the instructions - I just put in the batteries, put in the memory card, turned it on, and I was taking pictures moments later! Surfing the menus in the LCD window is as easy as surfing the web.

<B>PROS:</B>

   Here are the things I like about the HP 315: It's very easy to use. It has many of the features you will find on other digital cameras costing $700 or more. The interactive menus are simple to use. The "joystick" control button is a nice touch. Other brands of digital cameras costing only $50 dollars less than the HP 315 don't have half the features it has (and at that, most of them have only fixed memory). I won't ever have to send in rolls of film to be developed again. You can set it to give you an instant review of the picture you just took - with the option to keep the shot or delete it from memory. With the LCD display switched on before you snap the picture, it shows you in real time (like a video cam) what you are about to take. My flatbed scanner can take a breather now. The removable flash memory cards make downloading photos to my harddrive a snap through a USB flash card drive (I have the Sandisk Imagemate SDDR-31). A USB flash card drive saves the camera's batteries! You can change a flash card faster than you can change a roll of film. It takes great pictures. I find the medium resolution setting (1600x1200) to be just perfect. Unless you have a really expensive monitor, you probably won't need to take pictures at the maximum resolution setting. Most cameras at this price sport about 1.5 (2.0 if your lucky) Megapixels. This one clocks in at 2.1 Megapixels.

<B>CONS:</B>

   Now here is what I don't like: It eats batteries. No power adapter included with it. At $299, you would think HP might find it in their heart to at least include a power adapter. The 8MB flash card that comes with it doesn't hold very many pictures (20 pics at 1600x1200). The digital zoom is something you probably won't mess with, since it is only 2.5x. Using it will cause your pictures to blur a bit. Too bad this one doesn't have true optical zoom.

<B>How Well It Works:</B>

   How well does it take pictures? Very well! I took the HP Photosmart 315 out with the Youth Group while we sang Christmas carols. It was dark out, and while we stood outside people's houses singing under the illumination of only one or two porch lights, I took pictures. I figured that if the shots came out too dark, I could fix the brightness/contrast later using software on my computer. Later, when we got back to the social room for snacks and hot chocolate, I took more pictures, under the fluorescent lights. Some of the kids got in my face - only inches from the lens while I snapped pictures. Anybody who has ever tried to take pictures in the dark, or under fluorescent lighting, or any closer than 18 inches to the lens knows what kind of pictures the average camera takes in such conditions. Garbage in, garbage out. But NOT with the HP Photosmart 315. The pictures came out great! The dark wasn't a problem at all. With the flourescent lighting, only the backgrounds of those shots had some yellow in them. Despite a little yellow, the pictures came out clear with the main subject properly illuminated. And those shots with the kids faces only inches from the lens - they came out nice and sharp too. Most cameras require the subject to be a foot and a half away from the lens at least.

   The 2.1 Megapixel resolution of this camera is great. This one captures the detail of your subject, right down to those little grey mustache hairs you never realized you had(!). 

<B>Update:</B>

   With this camera, you will notice that the pictures you take with it are always going to be sharper than any taken using 35mm film! This camera gets all of the details! I have discovered that this camera absolutely loves to take pictures outdoors. I have also discovered that sometimes while shooting indoors (probably due to the slower shutter speed) in a room where there is a lot of light reflection, you may see extra points of light in the picture. I've noticed this particularly while taking pictures in our church's sanctuary. It seems digital cameras are prone to this because of their slower shutter speeds. The one situation this camera doesn't seem to like, is taking pictures of far away objects in a dimly lit room, such as in an auditorium. You need a faster exposure in such cases. But almost anything up to about 15-20 feet in a dimly lighted room will shoot fine.

<B>Recommendations:</B>

   <B>Batteries:</B> If you are going to get decent batteries, then get "Energizer e2 Titanium" AAs. They are a little more expensive than other alkaline batteries, but these last <i>more than three times longer</i>, and are worth the extra money! Using regular alkaline batteries, you won't get much more than 100 pictures using the HP Photosmart 315 - if you don't use the viewer screen on the back much. However, with the Energizer e2 Titanium batteries, I got 351 pictures, which I took over a period of three months - even using the viewer screen several times.

   <B>Uses:</B> All things considered, both good and bad, I would recommend the HP Photosmart 315 to anyone who is looking for a digital camera with a respectable amount of features, but aren't looking to go into debt in the process. What ever you do, don't ever buy a digital camera with fixed memory. This is a great all around camera for vacations, family outings and such. It performs well in almost every light condition - light, dark, even under fourescent lights! Looking for a good digital camera that is easy to use? Buy this one! I think this camera is cool. You will too.
