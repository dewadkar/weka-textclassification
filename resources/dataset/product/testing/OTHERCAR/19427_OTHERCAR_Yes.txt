            Bought my CR-V brand new almost 2 1/2 years ago--I use it mainly for going to work and back (3 miles each way) so that will explain why at this point in time I only have about 7200 miles on it--In the time I have had this car, there has been absolutely NOTHING wrong with it--not even any annoying rattles which used to plague me on previously owned brand new vehicles.  I also own a 1991 Honda Accord purchased new that has only 70K on it now and that is why I purchased a Honda again at the time I was in the market for a new vehicle.  You just cannot beat the reliability of a Honda and I am sold on their products.  Toyota products (including the so-called "top rated" Camry) have proven to be major disappointments to me and cannot compare with Honda automotive products.
    The only negative thing about the CR-V I am finding is that local gas mileage is very poor--only about 17-maybe 19 m.p.g at the absolute most.  My dealer was at a loss to explain the reason for this and judging by other reviews here great gas mileage is quite common but I have yet to take this vehicle on any long distance trips to see what highway gas mileage I can get.
    Bottom line is BUY A HONDA--you will NOT be disappointed!!! 
    BTW, bought the cheaper LX version and had the keyless entry (remote) added for a slightly added cost (it comes standard on the more expensive EX version)--that option alone is really worth any added cost.
