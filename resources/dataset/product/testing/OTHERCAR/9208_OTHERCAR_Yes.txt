            I purchased the Outback on the advice of a friend, at the time her family had two so I jugged they knew what they were talking about. When I did my homework I discovered that the Outback was an amazing concept. It merged the better of two worlds, the popular and attractive features of a Sport Utility Vehicle with the comforts of a sedan. The car has all the off-road capabilities of a SUV but also has the comfort and control of a mid-sized sedan. Another advantage is it's amazing mileage for such a large car. The car itself is somewhat large like an old wagon but it has good clearance and a low center of gravity. The newer models look rather attractive boasting smooth curves and hot colors. Driving the outback feels much like driving a sedan. The ride in the rear is also comfortable because of the low center of gravity. The Outback is ideal for families because of the room, comfort, and SUV like characteristics.<br><br>
