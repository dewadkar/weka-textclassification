            After years of driving a lame 1988 Dodge Dakota pickup with no power steering I came across a 1994 Mistubishi Eclipse that i could afford.  Let me say that it is the best car I have ever driven, hands-down.  Easy to maintain, easy to handle, and fast as all hell, this little demon of a car had me speeding down the freeway faster than you could say &quot;6-cylinder&quot;.  

The interior reminds me of a cockpit although more roomy than the 1995 re-model, and the features wrap around you quite nicely.  With a tilt wheel and adjustable lumbar support this vehicle is comfortable on longer trips as well as short outings.  The only problems I have noticed with this vehicle are that it burns off oil quite quickly, and when the tilt wheel is adjusted to a certain level it blocks out the driver's view of the speedometer.  Another shortcoming is the back seat space.  Anyone over 5'8&quot; will probably have a problem with bumping their heads on the low ceiling in the back seat, and leg room also becomes a problem in the back.  Of course this IS a sportscar and not a sedan so it may be expected.  

The cruise control is a handy feature for the longer rides and helps you save on gas consumption at the same time.  One thing drivers of the Eclipse need to watch out for is the low body height when driving out of driveways.  I have scraped bottom on my front spoiler many a time and it always grates your nerves when you do so, so just be sure to take those driveways slowly and angle out.  This car corners great and stays aligned quite nicely even with some rough driving on my part.  Trunk space is not a problem as I have fit a 300 watt combo bass amp in the back and still had room to spare.  Z-rated tires are a must as you need that extra grip when hitting the corners and speeding down the freeway trying to avoid the local highway patrol.  

I would recommend this vehicle for just about anyone who wants driving to be fun again.  It was certainly an eye-opener for me.<br><br>
