            I'm not a camera expert but wanted to get a decent digital camera to replace my entry-level Pentax SLR. After doing quite a bit of research, I decided on the s304.  I got it refurbished on ubid for a little over $300, so I was happy with the price. 

Initially I had trouble with the focus because if you just press the shutter button all the way down, without trying to lock in the focus, the picture will come out out of focus.  But after working with the camera for a few months, I've become quite good at it and rarely do I have an out of focus picture (unless I have someone else use it to take a picture of me and my family!).  

The optical zoom is very nice (4x) but the digital zoom is a waste of time unless you put the camera on a tripod.  Even then the picture quality goes down a bit. Also, you can only see a digitally-zoomed picture through the LCD and not the viewfinder.

Transferring your pictures via USB to my computer (Win xp home) works pretty well.  However, in order for the true colors to come out, the pictures taken off the camera need to be run through a Minolta-supplied software to change all the colors to the match the standard color pallete.  

I purchased two sets of rechargeable NiMH batteries and they seem to last pretty long.  However, the camera doesn't do a very good job of tracking the exact battery life left - usually the battery light will show low just before the camera shuts off due to a lack of juice.

While the camera is bigger that some of the compacts, it fits nicely in your hand and isn't too clunky to carry in a purse or bag.  I would recommend purchasing a 64 MB compact flash card (or greater) because the 16 MB card just isn't enough to store high resolution pictures.

Overall this is a good camera if you can get it for under $400.
