            I love this car.  I love Subaru.  It has that futuristic yet family style to it.  That's what makes it unique.  It's affordable, safe, and a cool car to drive.  I love the shape too.  The motto for the Outback &quot;Fun, Freedom, Adventure.&quot; suites this car perfectly.  It is a true family style car.  Safe for the mom, cool for the kids, and adventurous for the dad.  This is truly the world's finest Sport Utility Wagon.  The car is very comfortable and roomy.  Perfect for any road trip with the kids.  There is also a wide range of colors to pick from also.  And if you live in a state/city with a lot of ice and snow.  The All Wheel Drive (AWD) could come in handy.  So, why should a family buy this car?
It's Safe:  All Wheel Drive with all the power of an SUV.  It handles the roads nicely, whether you live in San Diego, CA or Syracuse, NY. Through any extreme, this is the car to be in. 
It's Fun:  This is a fun car.  The cool color combos are a perfect style for any young driver.  My personal favorite is the navy blue and silver.  The car has a neat futuristic shape and is truly unique from all other wagons.
It's Adventurous:  You can be the dare devil that you are (under the law of course) and still be safe in this SUV with All Wheel Drive.  Tackle any road, sun or hail.  
All in all, a five star car for the whole family-my personal favorite!
