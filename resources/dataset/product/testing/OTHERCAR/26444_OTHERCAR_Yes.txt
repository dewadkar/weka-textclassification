            My friend and I were sitting in my car, getting ready to drive, in a parking lot which faces the road. I was putting a CD in, and he says, &quot;hey look, there's a new Jag S-Type&quot;. So I look up, not really caring...and say, &quot;you idiot that's a brand new Bentley Arnage Red Label&quot;. So being the car lover that I am, I peeled out of the parking lot and followed this gorgeous navy blue Arnage from behind (because I couldn't get around it). 

I followed for about 10 minutes until I hit a red light and it sailed through. I almost cried as it drove away. Luckily it was a fast light and I managed to follow it again all the way to the persons house. My heart was racing the whole entire time because I couldn't believe that I was beside one of these things. Trust me, seeing it in pictures does not do this car justice. You have to see it in real life to understand how exclusive this car is. 

The back end looks very elegant, proper, and European. The side of it looks so nice with the chrome handles and just the length of the car. The interior was white burlap, hahaha, leather and had the best wood trim and chrome gauges I have ever seen. But man, when you see the front end...it has THE most outrageously awesome looking grill ever! The chain mesh grill looks insane, and the tinted lights just add to that mean effect.
 
I was sorry to see the car pull into the owners driveway but it sure was worth following it. The lucky person driving it was a woman and I swear, her head did not move the entire time as we drove over pot holes. 

Everyone says that this car is overpriced but if you see it in real life, it immediately justifies the price, seriously. Nothing on the road can touch this superior car, in build quality and looks. After, when were on our way home we saw a new Mercedes S500 and I wanted to spit on it for trying to be the luxury car that the Arnage is. hahaha. 

At one of the lights that we were stopped at with the Bentley in front of us, there was a teenager sitting in his Ford Escort Wagon parked next to the Bentley, and he was looking straight ahead, not giving any attention to the quarter of a mill USD car next to him. So I said to my friend, &quot;I am two seconds away from: getting out, reaching through that guy's window, pulling him of his car, and yelling at him to look at the Arnage&quot;

If I win the lottery, there will definitely be one sitting in my driveway.<br><br>
