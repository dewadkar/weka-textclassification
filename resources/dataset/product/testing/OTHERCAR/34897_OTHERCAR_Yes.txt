            I bought this vehicle because I was so tired of no room in my Honda Civic 2Dr coup. Having a wife and a fast growing son we needed the extra space.
I wanted something with safety, comfort, dependabilty and power. After looking around at other choices, Ford, Chrysler, Dodge, Oldsmobile, Toyota and Mazda couldn't compare. The Honda Odyssey has more cubic square feet at 170.6, more than any other on the market. An impressive 210 horsepower in a V6 3.5 liter engine. One thing I noticed right away is the great looks of the van. I love the easy dual sliding door's, and the dual power rear vent windows added the extra touch. I love not having to remove the third bench seat, because it retracks into the floor. 
    Driving this van is so much like driving a Honda Accord. Easy handling and turning radius was very impressive. I was worried about top heaviness but I was wrong. Honda's double wishbone suspension and front struts gave the Honda Odyssey an edge over the rest. It's also easy to park and back-up, visibilty was also a plus. I highly recommend this van to those that want a very roomy and comfort ride on long trips or camping.
This vehicle would be recommended to families with active children and traveler's. This van has it all. Ask me any question about this van and I can answer it.<br><br>
