            My husband owns a 1989 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme with over a 100,000 miles on it. We have owned this car since 1997 and have just recently paid it off. It was a one owner car before he found it at Anton Chevrolet in Canton, NC. He was looking for something sporty, quick, reliable, and with lots of room (considering he is 6&quot;6&quot;). He fell in love with this candy apple red Cutlass Supreme and so we got it financed. This has been one of the most reliable cars we both have ever owned. It still handles like a new car and has had only one visit to the repair shop since we have owned it (it needed a fuel pump). It handles well in ice and snow and is the only vehicle that we use to get around in the winter weather conditions. It did take a nasty bump on the front end from a tree once while he was driving on ice. However, the bumper bounced back into shape and the only thing that was wrong with the car was a loss of paint on the bumper. Once, a 1999 Escourt rear ended him on a two lane road going 50 in a 35 zone. His rear bumper barely had a scratch and the Escourt had over $2000 worth of damage to its front end. So, we know it is a tough car. He refuses to trade the Cutlass for a newer car and plans to replace the engine when the original engine dies.<br><br>
