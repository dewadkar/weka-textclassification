            I just received this camera and I used it for three solid days in Washington, DC covering the IMF/World Bank protests for a political web site.  Even though it was a short period of time, I ran this camera through the paces and it was exposed to both heat and rain.

First of all, this camera is expensive for what it offers.  In this price range most cameras have better resolution.  However, if you can get one cheap it's great.  I paid only $367 via mobshop.com and I'm mostly satisfied.  I don't know if I would feel that way I had paid $700.  (I doubt anyone can get it that cheap again there since they've upped the base price quite a bit.)  

As an internet camera this model is great.  You don't need high resolution shots for the net.  Every shot I took was 640 X 480, the lowest res. setting on the camera, and 95% came out fine, especially given the conditions in DC when it rained.  The max resolution is 1280 X 960.

The audio record function is also great for the net, although five seconds just doesn't seem long enough.  Ten seconds would be much better. The QuickTime function on this model is rather poor at a mere 10 frames a second.  This results in a very choppy image.  After I shot two ten second movies and viewed the results I never used it again.  

The SD4090 comes with a 16 shot burst mode which is good for a digital camera, but hard to adapt to for someone who is used to a 35mm camera since you aren't seeing the mirror raise in between shots like you would on an SLR.  It's hard to describe, it just felt awkward to use.  However, at this time it seems like most digital cameras are like this.  Ditto the length of time it takes for the camera to record to disk.  Even in burst mode, once you take your finger off the shutter, be prepared to wait several seconds before being able to shoot again.

This camera also comes with a SuperDisk drive that is one of the most pragmatic functions I've seen.  It holds up to 1500 shots!  Critics blast the Sony Mavica line but they had the right idea -- people need inexpensive media to shoot photos and they need it to easily fit into their computers.  The SuperDrive also takes 3.5 disks which makes it easy to take a photo and then just give the disk to someone else.  Can't do that with most digital cameras.  Also, the USB function, which I haven't yet tested, seems to be a great idea.  If your computer doesn't have a USB hookup it's fairly inexpensive to get one.  I only paid $30 for a PCI slot USB card for my Mac.

One of the complaints that I've read about this camera in the press is that it's too large and heavy.  I found neither to be accurate.  Frankly, I hate small cameras.  They feel fragile and I worry that I'll drop them accidentally.  Also, after using SLRs my whole life this camera is light in comparison.   

My biggest complaint about the camera is the viewing screen.  First of all, I want a viewfinder.  Using that screen was inconvenient and not conducive to catching all the small details in the shot.  Second, and more importantly, the screen itself is fragile.  I scratched (slight, but still very annoying) mine in several places the first day after it hung around my neck as I walked the streets of DC.  

Do I recommend this camera?  Yes, but with one condition: Don't pay $700 for it.  If you can get it cheap through a site like mobshop.com or through an auction then it's potentially a great camera.  I know it has drastically improved the content of my political web site, especially the audio capability and the ease of use with 3.5 disks, but I don't think I would feel that way if I had paid more.
