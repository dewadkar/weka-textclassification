            We bought a Dodge Grand Caravan new in 1998 to replace our well worn Ford Taurus Wagon.  At the out set I was worried about buying another American car. There were several things that were never right about the Ford.  And I already had suffered through ownership of a Dodge truck during the bad old days of the 1970's when quality was job 47. But the Caravan had many evident virtues - space, ergonomics and price.  The kids love it.  They have there own separate spaces.  On long trips we fold down the middle seat and put the tv/video player on it.  In the course of two movies and a nap we can cover 400 miles without a whimper or a whine.  

But ultimately the Caravan comes up short.  Quality may now be job 23, but certainly not job 1.  When the car was delivered the steering pulled to the right, and there was a odd rattle in one of the doors.  We took it back to have them fixed. Both problems were sort of fixed, but still discernable.  Its an awful feeling when you have laid out a big chunk of money on something that appears to have lingering problems.  Our initial response to this disappointment was denial.  We tried to tell ourselves that we were being hypersensitive; that these small things did not really matter.  That was a mistake.

After 20,000 (approx. 2 years) miles we find that the problem with the front end has grown worse.  The front tires are chewed up - unuseable.  The front brakes (pads and rotors had to be replaced).  The dealer has all kinds of excuses for this - everything except the possibility that something is wrong with the car.  (Yes, we have rotated the tires twice and kept the air pressure up.)

So we have a Dodge Caravan that exhibits the kind of chronic problem that makes vehicle ownership a burden rather than a joy.  Our response is predictable I guess:  Never again.  Never another Chrysler.

The pros of the car are that my kids have lots of room.  It really is a tree house on wheels.

The cons are that the quality of the machine is so lacking that I have no confidence in it.  Thus do not enjoy driving it, and find myself waiting for the next manifestation of poor quality to appear.  In terms of quality, I feel like it really is just a tree house with wheels
