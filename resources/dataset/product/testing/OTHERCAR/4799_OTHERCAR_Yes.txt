            I bought this car for $700 at 232,000 miles knowing it needed some work.  After installing a new axle, tires, brakes, rear wheel cylinders, battery and exhaust (two repairs). I would expect similar maintenance on any car after 70,000 miles. 

I have taken the car, with my kids, to South Dakota, Colorado (twice), and Yellowstone.  The engine got a little hot (no coolant escaped) coming back from Yellowstone, but that is probably because I was running about 85-90 and had a cargo bag on the roof.  While the car was hot power and mileage was significantly reduced but nothing failed.  I stopped for awhile to let it cool down and finished the trip back to Topeka, Kansas without incident.

The air conditioner gave out in September 2001.  A passenger door handle for entry broke when I first got the car and it remains broken.

The car mileage has ranged from 22 to 42.  Generally in mixed driving I am getting about 30.  This is an improvement over when I first got the car, when it got about 26mpg.  On the road and not exceeding 70mph it gets about 35mpg.  This drops to 30 at 75-80mph.

In town the car is fairly quite, but on the highway it gets pretty buzzy.

I think for as many miles as this car has it has been reliable.
