            I got my Hewlett Packard Smart Photo c200 a few months ago as a gift from my husband. Over all I am quite happy with it. Although there are things you should know before you buy one...

First and foremost it goes through the batteries really fast, and I mean REALLY fast! 

It takes four double A batteries which aren't too expensive.

With mine I can take maybe ten pictures before I have to put in new batteries. And that is if I don't mess with it too much, just take the pictures and turn it off. If you leave it on they will go even faster.

It will store up to 80 pictures, less depending on how fine you want the pictures to turn out. I always use the finest setting for better prints in case I decide to blow them up bigger then normal.

It does take good pictures, I have had no trouble with it in that area at all. Though you can't take pictures too close up as it will create a glare on the subject you are photographing.

It is wonderful for outdoor pictures as well as indoor pictures.

I love the fact that I can take a picture with this camera, hook it too my computer and send it too someone by email within minutes!

You can also get a film reader, don't know the technical term for that sorry, and it makes putting your photos on your computer for printing or emailing even faster!

The only other problem I have had with it is that the viewing screen, again I don't know the technical term, is very dark no matter how you set it. I have mine set on the brightest setting and it is still very difficult to see your photo subject in the little window, as it is so dark. So basically indoors you are "taking a shot in the dark". 

Outdoors this problem is not so bad, with the extra light source.

Over all I am happy with this camera, and very happy to have it. Just be sure that if you invest in one you are ready to invest in extra batteries as well. And don't go with the expensive batteries thinking they will last longer, they won't.


UPDATE: I just went out and bought a connector for this camera at Wal-Mart for about ten dollars so that I don't need batteries. It works great! I don't have to worry about the batteries dying now. Only drawback is I am tied down by a cord, can't go far with it.  

Also, the guy at Wal-Mart said that lithium batteries would last longer.
