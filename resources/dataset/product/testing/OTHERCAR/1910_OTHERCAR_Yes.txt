            This car is indeed a &quot;super&quot; car.  When it came time to trade in my husband's Infiniti G-20 lease, I have to admit I was hesitant about getting the Maxima.  Not as cultured and stylish as the Infiniti G-20, the Maxima had a streamlined, more masculine look than I typically like. Something about the Maxima made me feel a tiny bit intimidated, maybe it was the salesman telling my husband how fast and hot the car was.  That sort of conversation made me worried I wouldn't be able to handle that much car.  I prefer a smaller car and a slower car, I do drive a mini van in my daily life.  To me, the Maxima seemed big and it sounded fast. Also, I was very worried about pulling the car into our garage.

The Maxima handles very nicely, though.  Granted, the car is bigger than the G-20, but I couldn't tell when I was behind the wheel. I had no trouble pulling into parking places and even navigated the garage fairly well. 

You can feel the power in the engine when you drive, but it isn't overwhelming or intimidating. The drive is nice and smooth and very, very quiet.  The seats are roomy and comfortable, an option for leather  is available, though we did choose cloth.  The Maxima offers more than enough room in the back seat for our three children, and the two teenagers assured us they were very comfortable.  I was thrilled to see and hear this, I am very weary of driving a mini van, and seeing the kids in the back getting along gave me hope for a sedan of my own one day.

Unlike the G-20, the cup holders in this car are great.  I like to know I can travel and carry my coffee without fear of spillage.

I never considered the Maxima to be a family car, but it really does work well for us as just that.  The downside to this car is, it does take premium gas.  Hopefully, gas prices will lower soon.  These prices do put a drain on the pocketbook when traveling any distance.

The trunk is very roomy, I was able to do a Costco trip for five and pack it all with space to spare.

I am very pleased with the Maxima, and I have been told, when you put your &quot;pedal to the metal&quot; this car can fly.
