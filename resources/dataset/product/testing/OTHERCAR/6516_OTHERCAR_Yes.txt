            My wife and I have always liked German Cars--I've owned 2 BMW's and my wife a VW and a Mercedes Benz--but after test driving the Volvo 960 Sedan we've seen the light.  I couldn't believe the amount of car we got for the money!  Ours is a fully loaded, 1997 Volvo 960 Sedan with 40,000 miles on it used.

I test drove our Volvo first, then took out a 1997 BMW 740i with comparable mileage, and to my amazement I liked the drive and handling of the Volvo better.  I feel absolutely confident that I got a car with as sophisticated a drive as a car $10,000 more expensive.  Our Volvo had every feature I wanted--I especially liked the comfort of the leather seats, its premium sound, integrated phone, moonroof and interior wood accents--at a price of $20,000 out the door.  All I can say is that our used Volvo is the best deal I've ever made on a vehicle.

I did like the 850 GLT Turbo Sedan about as much as the 960 though (the model with traction control and all the bells and whistles).  I wouldn't have felt cheated at all if we had gotten the 850 instead.  Either car would have been a wonderful value. <br><br>
