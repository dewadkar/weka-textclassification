            Jaguars are my favorite cars in the whole wide world.  I have never owned one cause I could never afford one even though they are affordable just not for me.  Not only are they very classy and luxorious they are very fast so it is a nice cruising car.  The outside is just like a thing of beauty and if you don't like this car there must be something wrong with you.  And the inside has pure leather and it is just beautiful I have seen one and test drove it once it is very powerful if I had money this is the first thing I would buy.  I suggest if you can afford this car go out and get one right away.<br><br>
