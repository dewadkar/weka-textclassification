            Let's get one thing straight--a sports car this is not(although every Mustang/Camaro/BMW driver will want to race you thinking it is). If a performance car is what you're after, then you should probably look somewhere else. 

This is, first and foremost, a luxury coupe. From the solid sound of the heavy doors closing to the glass smooth engine and ride, everything about the SC400 exudes quality and smoothness. 

But that's not to say it's like driving a Caddy. Far from it. It's plenty fast, and the SC400 is endowed with extremely good driving dynamics. It shares it's multi-link suspension with the Supra and, for a luxury coupe, handling is superlative, marred only slightly by steering that's a touch on the light side. 

Inside, though, there are no caveats. The SC400 has one of greatest interiors ever put in an automobile. Tasteful and artful, it's a hedonists dream. 

About the only complaint you'll hear about these cars is that the body style has been around since 92. However, the SC coupes were updated in 97, so the car still looks modern and is rare to boot (honestly, how many of the newer body style SC's (97+) do you really see?).

BTW, I also own a six speed twin turbo Supra and I prefer driving the Lexus (for those of you who think that's geezer talk, I'm under 30). But if you really want to know what these cars are like, consider this--all three members of my family drives an SC.
