            I drive an Acura Integra. Ok, *correction*, I <i>drove</i> an Acura Integra '98 model. Since I couldn't find the "driving defensively" topic, I'll post my epinion under this one, considering this was the car I drove when I crashed.

<b>Background...</b>
I'm 16. I'm supposedly a responsible, mature 16 year old. People like me don't get into accidents. And just because of that mindset, I got into one. I had been driving for just about a month, and actually things were going pretty well. Although I drove a small "sports car," it was fairly comfortable. 

Well, the other day I was exiting a small by-street, onto an opening. I saw somebody I knew up ahead, and without thinking just drove. At that moment, a car hit me...my side of the car, but luckily not the door. He hit the wheel area, and I bumped my head pretty hard. He then stopped claimed his wife was having a baby and I was so shaken up, I was like "whatever." I drive my car into a close parking lot (well not exactly drive...the thing wasn't drivable) and proceed to bawl. My head injury is now the size of a baseball.

I call everyone. My father comes and takes me to the hospital. My best friend and her father had the car towed. Luckily, I was in good hands. Turns out I had sustained a few "dry injuries" like 2 contusions, and the next day my body is in a lot of pain. Also, I amounted just about 5,000 dollar damage to the car.

<b>The moral of this story...</b>
Don't let teenagers drive. At least, don't let me drive. And if you do, make sure it's not a small car.

Also, don't drive when you are stressed about a bad chemistry grade, overly excited about doing well in debate, with a friend in the car, listening to music, and sick. 

The most important thing to note is that a car accident may be awful, but puts everything into perspective. If the man had hit my door, instead of about 1 foot further, I could have had at least a few broken bones, and if he would have hit me head on, I could have died. This just makes you think of how important life is. Also, it makes me feel better knowing that my friends care, because the phone was ringing all night. 

Not to mention, no matter how many times your parents tell you to concentrate, it's never really stuck in your head, until something like this happens. 

There's always a silver lining in ever cloud.

<b>Other things I learned...</b>
Sure I feel like the world's worst driver right now, but I know I'm not. This sort of thing could happen to anyone.

I learned that as soon as something like this happens to call 911, and not try to move. Also, make sure you get the insurance number of the guy, even if it is your fault and the guy claims his wife is having a baby.

Acuras are really too small. Not many 16 year olds should start out with a sports car...not because of the status symbol, but because it's friggin painful to get into an accident while driving one.

<b>Weird thing is...</b>
I expected a worse punishment. But really, I'm not a bad kid. I don't go reckless driving. I don't drink or do drugs. I'm worried and have lots on my mind, and that's not healthy either...but luckily, nothing horrific happened.

So no driving with friends in the car for 6 months. Only allowed to drive to school for the next 6 months. No radio, highways (as always), wear glasses, etc. But really, that's only fair. At least I'll get to drive again...

That is...if I'm still up to it.

And right about now, I'm not too sure I am.
