            I've owned my '92 V6 since new and it now has nearly 130,000 miles on the clock. I have been pretty religious about servicing and oil changes. It has functioned well in its primary role as family transport and has seen the kids grow up since the diaper stage.  The ride is quiet and the seats comfortable & interior well put together.  The front and rear a/c deal well with the brutal Atlanta summers and have performed flawlessly since new. 

Since the outset I have believed the car to be somewhat under-braked.  I just don't think the front disk/rear drum  setup is enough to bring this beast, fully-laden, to a quick stop in an emergency situation.  I believe Mazda put started putting disks on the rear in the 94 or 95 model years.

My major problem was with the valve-gear on the engine.  Inadequate oil channels in the  rocker shafts used to stop the hydraulic lash adjusters pumping up enough so I'd get this noisy clicking. It sounded like  an old diesel. Three years ago I spent $1,000 to have the valve gear replaced with modified parts and that permanently cured the problem.

Other than that, reliability has been good, with normal wear & tear accounting for any bits I've had to replace.
