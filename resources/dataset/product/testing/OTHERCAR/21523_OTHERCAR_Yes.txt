            The 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee features a somewhat new body style that will immediately catch your attention.  On these newer models, the sides are more sculpted, where the older one has plastic runner that went halfway up the side of the vehicle.  There are a few other cosmetic differences on the outside of the vehicle, but the most significant one is the redesign of the lines along the side.

One particularly nice feature is the split rear end.  The entire back opens like a hatchback, but you can also just open the back window.  This can allow for loading large items that can stick out the window, so you don't have to drive with the entire hatchback open.

On the inside, the new Grand Cherokee is well designed, although its a little plain.  I have a major complaint about the frosted plastic used on most of the dashboard and console.  The frosted plastic is more likely to show scratches, but it tends to catch dust more easily.  Another problem is that it doesn't look as good when you armor all it.  The benefit of it would be that things don't slide around on it as much.

The front bucket seats of this Jeep are very large and comfortable.  When you first get it, you will notice that they are very cushiony and springy.  The rear seat is also quite comfortable, and it also lets down to allow for a larger cargo area.

Front leg room needs some work!  I'm 6'2" and need more leg room than most, and the inside of this Jeep doesn't leave much to go on.  Sitting in the passenger side, my feet are almost together.  There seems to be a little more in the driver's side, but not much.  This could make things a bit uncomfortable for longer trips.

Once on the road, you will notice that this Jeep is pretty quiet, considering its size.  I found the gas pedal to be quite touchy, and this thing will certainly go when you hit the pedal.  Braking is very solid and turning was very nice.  I found this Jeep's turning radius to be very nice.  All in all, this vehicle rides and handles very well.

One final note, I found that I had to offset the balance on the stereo in order for my music to sound right.  The front speakers are placed in the upper middle of the door, and the driver sits so far to the left that you have to adjust the sound to be about 60% to the right in order for it to sound properly balanced.  This is not a big deal, but something you should be aware of.

All things said, I like this vehicle.  It has a few design flaws, such as front leg room, but thats mostly because I am so tall.  Is it worth the price?  That's for you to decide.
