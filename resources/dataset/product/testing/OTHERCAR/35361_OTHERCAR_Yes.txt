            i live in colorado and virtually all the driving i do is for 20+ miles. the 850 is the ideal car for this. first, i get a consistent 29-30 mpg.  this enables me to go about 500 miles on a tank. the car is very comfortable and has more than adequate pick up for the mountain terrain (i have the 170 bhp 2.4L). the power seat is adjustable to fit the needs of anyone.  the cupholders can cause problems when you want to get to something in the storage compartment, but are otherwise well designed.  the sound system is excellent.  (i have the base system and installed a 6 disc changer to work).  the amount of cargo space is great.  the rear seats fold down (you have three options) for even more room.  i have no problem fitting skis or my surfboard in the back.  the safety features can be seen throughout the car, and i haven't had to test them yet.  the reliablity of my car has also been excellent, but the dealer knowledge hasn't been the best.  i thought i had a problem with my valet key, and the dealer was not helpful. i ended up buying a new key, because i didn't know how to operate the valet function.  in addition, vovlo dealers are rather expensive, $20 for a key.  luckily, other owners at www.brickboard.com helped me and told me i just need to turn my master key another 1/4 turn. overall, i am very satisfied with my car. when i bought the car it had 37k mi on it.<br><br>
