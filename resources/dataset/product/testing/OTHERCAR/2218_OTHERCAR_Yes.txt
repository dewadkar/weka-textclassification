            I have always wanted a SUV  Who wouldn't?  There sporty AND functional.  I test-drove the Sportage and the Tracker. The Suzuki Vitara was the best! 

I have to say it.  The car's cute....there is no other word for it.  Mine is black with a grey interior.  It is very stylish and able to seat four comfortably.  In the summer, it's great to peel the top off and go driving around with the wind in your hair.  In the winter, relax as the snow comes down...you have four-wheel drive!

As for features, I have a soft top and it is relatively easy to get back in place. I also have the cassette deck but no other bells or whistles!  I'm a college student and this car is pretty economical.

Driving this car is a joy.  I have tried out the 4 wheel drive and it has wonderful tracking.  It corners easily and gets good gas mileage.  

You should buy one, you won't be sorry!<br><br>
