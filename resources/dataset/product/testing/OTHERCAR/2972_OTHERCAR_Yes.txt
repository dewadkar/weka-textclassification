            I bought this camera so we could take pictures at our wedding, instead of hiring a photographer.
Right now I don't really use my 35mm camera that much, so initially I didn't really ever want a digital camera because I didn't think I'd ever use it. I was wrong. I use my digital camera nearly every day, it is sooo handy!
You'll never say to yourself "hmm should i take that picture or is it a waste of film?" 
I take pictures of almost everything! Last one I took was my roommates' cats lying lazily on my bed :)
See, on a regular film camera, that would be a waste of film!

<b>packaged with this camera</b>
-<b>EasyShare Dock:</b> You plug it into your computer and into a power outlet. Sit the camera on top, hit the button and it is now in "transfer mode" (as opposed to recharging), after you tell the kodak software to transfer, all your pictures are on your computer in seconds (or minutes depending on how many pictures you have). The camera recharges in the loading dock when you aren't transferring pictures.
-<b>Li-Ion rechargeable battery:</b> don't be fooled, not all digital cameras actually come with rechargeable batteries, but this one does! yay!
-<b>5V a/c adapter:</b>plug it into your dock to recharge batteries, or plug it into your camera to use the camera without using batteries.
-<b>video out cable:</b>so you can see your pictures on TV!
-<b>usb cable:</b> to connect your camera to your computer.
-<b>wrist strap:</b> so your camera doesn't go flying if you have butter fingers like me.
-<b>software:</b> so you can edit pictures and do fun stuff like make your photographs into coloring book pages.
-<b>documentation and user's guides:</b> the users guides for the software as well as the camera are more in depth on the cd, but it also comes in paper form (not so in depth).

<b>picture quality</b>
-this camera shoots up to 4.0 megapixels. 
-you can choose your picture quality, so say you just wanted to use the pictures for email or internet, you'd put it on the lowest quality, which is 1 megapixel. I actually printed this quality out onto photo paper wallet-sizes and the quality was still stunning.
-you'd use the medium or best settings (2.2-4.0 Megapixels) for enlargements. The best setting is so good that you can print at 20"x30" and not lose quality!

<b>the zoom</b>
-3X optical zoom, which is 35mm-105mm.
-3.3X digital zoom, which you can use once you need more zoom after the 3X optical zoom, but I don't recommend it because it makes the pictures all blurry.

<b>the flash</b>
-auto
-fill
-red-eye
-off

<b>other stuff</b>
-white balance: choose your type of lighting for the best picture. (auto, daylight, tungsten, fluorescent)
-automatic sharpen
-choose your ISO. I've never taken mine off of automatic, which is 100 & 200 speed. you can use the menu to switch it to 400 if needed)
-scene modes: auto, landscape, night, sport, macro.
-burst mode: maximum 3 pictures at any resolution/
-color: color, black & white, sephia (olden days brownish)
-a "share" button: hit share after you take the picture or if you're in review mode to tag the picture to be emailed.
-a "delete" button: hit the button after you take the picture or in review mode to erase the picture from the camera.
-10 second self timer (if  you have no one to take the picture for you)
-225g without batteries.
-If you push the button to take a picture halfway down, it will autofocus for you and create a beam of light on your subject.

<b>let's make a movie!</b>
-I haven't actually used this function of the camera yet.
-video and audio capture and playback on camera 

<b>memory</b>
-the amount of memory on any given camera is what tells you how many pictures you can take at any given quality.
-this comes with an internal 16MB chip, I bought an extra 64MB so I can take a ton of pictures for my wedding.

<b>the battery</b>
you know, i really can't tell you much about the battery, I recharge mine quite often so I've never used it up until the battery has died.
-I'll assume it lasts 200-300 exposures.

<b>system requirements</b>
Windows: 
WINDOWS 98, 98SE, 2000, Millennium Edition, or XP OS 
233 MHz processor or greater 
64MB RAM (128MB RAM for Windows XP)

200MB hard disk space available

<b>what I liked</b>
-this camera is such good quality for the price.  nothing compares!
-With 80MB of memory, it does
~182 at the lowest quality (which i will remind you is still amazing)
~90 at the medium quality (2.2 Megapixels)
~49 at the best quality (4.0 Megapixels).
- you can use different qualities for different pictures.
-you can choose not to use the LCD to save batteries.
-pretty much everything.

<b>what I didn't like</b>
- I had to buy an extra 64MB of memory, I wish I could tell you how much memory makes how many pictures, but i can't seem to find any information online. 
-Had to buy my own camera bag.
-when you take a picture, the LCD displays your picture for a while so you can't just shoot rapidly using the screen, but you can if you look through the viewfinder.
