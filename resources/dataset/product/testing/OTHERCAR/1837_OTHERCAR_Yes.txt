            I use to own a 1989 Grand Am and had 1 major problem with the car up until I got rid of it in 1997.  The cost of the repairs cost me no more than $500.00.  That is not that bad.  

I now have a 1997 Pontiac Grand Am.  It actually looks like the picture above.  I don't think much changed from 1997 and 1998 model but I LOVE my car.  It is very comfortable to drive in.  I enjoy driving my car and just relaxing and listening to the music on the way to and from work.

I have not had any major problems with the vehicle yet.  I do take care of it very carefully.  As soon as I hear a noise, I bring it into my mechanic to look at or fix.  I have not spent an outrageous amount on my car. It maybe because of my great mechanic who greatly takes care of me; but I know when it want it fixed right, the car goes to him.

I can't say I ever took it on a long road trip and I think I may be afraid to because the temperature gauge stays high.  After sitting in Jersey traffic for a while, the fan is constantly running.  I have already replaced the brakes and the tires. I only changed the tires because of the winters we get.  Don't know when we will get them again, but as a precautionary, I got new ones).  I will also need struts in the near future but I will refuse to pay for them. I will be after the service group of the dealership to replace them.  The car doesn't have that many mileage and the struts I believe should last for at least 60,000 miles.

The car is very roomy and can definitely fit a lot into it.  The back seats pull down so the trunk is longer (great for skis or mountain bikes).  The stereo system is great.  I have had no problems with it.  There are little speakers by the side mirrors that help the music sound so much better.  The CD player and the sunroof are the best options to have.  I will never own another car that doesn't include these options.  It is a must have.  The gas mileage is also great.  

The handling in the car is great. You rarely slide in the rain. In the snow, all you have to do is click the button for traction and you can get up hills without sliding.  Just take it easy and you will get there.



I have one problem with the car and but that is not the car it is PONTIAC...Their brakes are horrible!  They are gone in such a short time.  Of course, it doesn't help when you sit in traffic every day stopping and going the entire way.

Another Problem I have is DON'T ever buy this car with white rims.  They will NEVER stay white!  The brake dust is horrible!

I would recommend the Pontiac Grand Am to anyone looking for a reliable fairly cheap car.<br><br>
