            There are finer digital cameras on the market.  They have a higher pixel capture rate than the Mavica.  But none of them have the convenience of this camera.

The 2.5 inch view screen is a comfortable size.  I displays the image very clearly, and there are light adjustments when your outside lighting changes.  The controls are very intuitive and easy to operate.  They are also fairly comprehensive.  I love how they are able with a tiny computer chip to put a tremendous amount of functionality into these machines.

The movie function is handy, but limited.  At fine resolution you get only about 15 seconds of video.

The pictures are very clear even if they are jpgs.  Fine resolution gives you a file of about 400 kbs - more than enough to work with if you're not producing professional output.

We use ours for our field technicians and professionals.  Every picture gets put on our system for use in a variety of work product.  The handiest thing about these cameras is that you use a common disk and can take that disk and load it into any computer.  No special cards, wires, or programs.  True plug and play.  And that's what puts this camera above many others.<br><br>
