            You can incur major expense without needing major repairs.  The fewer trips to the auto shop the better because these days, ANY repair is expensive.  That's my main concern with my Sebring.

The Sebring Convertible will offer you beauty, style and pride of ownership.  You also get a car that was manufactured with many low-quality parts which means more trips to the shop.  The good news is that most of your problems will not be serious, just expensive.  O2 sensors, instrument panel blackouts, wheel bearings, bad brakes, cheap top motor and hydraulic cylinders, etc....these common problems won't leave you stranded on the road side, but they cost money.

Then there's the car's "feel."  The Sebring integrity is marginal.  The car doesn't feel tight.  It has its share of rattles and unidentified noises, making the ride feel sort of cheap (on certain roads).  Your suspension will handle some types of road cracks well and others very poorly.

The windows are poorly designed so they rattle when not fully up or fully down.  Your door glass will develop little "tracks" from rubbing the door frame as it moves up and down over time.  Your lucky if your rear window defroster actually works.  Your top will develop wear spots or pinch points over time.  

But if you are willing to deal with this car's many minor character flaws and irritations, you will love having one.  I did a lot of research when I bought mine.  What I discovered scared me.  But I found one for a really good price - just couldn't pass it up.  Am I sorry that I bought it?  No way.  The good out weighs the bad.  

My advice to would-be buyers:  if you are really attracted to the car and can get one for a good price - BUY IT!   But realize that Chrysler built these with cheaper parts to keep the price competitive.  And it worked!  The Sebring Convertible is the best selling convertible ever.
