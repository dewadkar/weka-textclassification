            Even though I don't own the Accord, I have driven a friend's accord quite a bit over the past year.

It's a 1999 Accord, 4 cylinder, stick, Leather, Sunroof, Spoiler, Black.
I am not into sedans but this is a really nice looking car.  But what really surprised me was the performance. I have driven a lot of 4 cylinder Sedans (mostly rentals) that have a horrible pickup.  This car not only has the a great pickup for a 4 cylinder but is also one of the quietest cars in it's class along with the Toyota Camry.

It does have a very nice stereo system/CD.  All the buttons (windows etc) are just placed right.  One annoying feature are the sunroof buttons.  Even after driving it for a while, it is tough to remember which one opens the sunroof, closes the sunroof or tilts it.    Other good features though are decent trunk size, great legroom in the back and of course the HONDA name. If you are out for a sedan, this is probably one of your best bets.
