               My 1994 Tercel is the first car that I have had that still ran well after paying it off. I specifically bought it for that reason.  I looked at all the cars on the road and went for the one car that I saw the most old beat up cars being driven.  That was the Toyota Tercel.  Cars, no paint left on them, older than the hills, uglier than all get out but still running like the energizer bunny.  That is what I wanted.  This would be the best first car for anyone.  It does not come with lots of bells and whistles but my Tercel has over 90,000 (very hard miles) with no mechanical problems ever.  The only times I have had it in the shop have been for the air conditioner which was fixed under the warranty. I know that I could have this car for twenty years because I see 1980 Tercels still running.  
   The next consideration with buying the Tercel was the price.  I had just gotten married and did not need a huge payment.  The price was right:P  Anyone with enough money could not have to worry about their cars breaking down but before this car, I used to get stranded often.  I thought I would have to spend a lot of money to have that security but I have never been stranded by my little Tercel.  I told a friend of my mother's about how great I thought Tercel's were and she bought the oldest Tercel that I have seen yet.  It runs like a champ.  She has had it now for years and loves it.  No problems at all.  
   The only problem that I have with the Toyota Tercel is that it is so small.  I now have a child and want more children and it is a tight fit now but if you are just starting out with no family yet, this is a perfect car.   <br><br>
