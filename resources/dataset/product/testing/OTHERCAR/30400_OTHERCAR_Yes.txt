            I've heard plenty of terrible things about the Aztek.  I've even seen entire websites devoted to trashing it.  But as far as I can tell, when it comes down to it, the only problem with the Aztek is how it looks, which is purely personal preference.  I bought a 2001 Aztek and since I have only enjoyed it more every day I own it.  The ride is amazing, and contrary to many reviews, the gauges are very easy to read.  I moved in it, and fit a 6' long dresser into it, among other things, and could still have my husband and son in a carseat in the vehicle.  The gas mileage is good, better than the Toyota RAV4 even.  The tailgate makes loading easy, and I even like the tent.  The only problem we've had with it is that the door handle (front doors) is placed so far forward that if you open the door on a windy day it's almost impossible to get the leverage to hold the door shut.  We actually bent the hinges on the door the first week we had it. Luckily the deal fixed it for free though.  Anyways, fooey on those who think its ugly.  Didn't your mother teach you not to judge a book by its cover?
