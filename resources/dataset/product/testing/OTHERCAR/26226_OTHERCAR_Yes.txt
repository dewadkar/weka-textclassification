            I've read several comments about the X5's poor gas mileage or that it is pricey, but you should expect a vehicle like this to come at a higher price. If you're wanting something that is totally different than any other SUV on the market, then step up to the plate and hit a home run with the X5. 

Comparing the X5, which admittedly I've only had for a few days may seem foolish so soon, but I know from experience having owned a few sports cars, that if your first impression doesn't knock your socks off, don't buy it!

You may think that comparing the X5 to a "true" sports car is like comparing apples to bananas, but the truth is, if you were to compare the X5 to another SUV, that's exactly what you'd be doing.

The X5 has more sports car characteristics than any utility vehicle on the market and if you're willing to wait a while longer, there's an even faster one just around the corner. 

It's because of the sports car characteristics of the X5, that you see so many comments about the small cargo space or that the suspension and steering are stiff.  That's to be expected with the X5. However, if you're looking for a "true" SUV at a good price, I'd strongly recommend the Acura MDX.

On the other hand, if you want a vehicle that not only feels and handles like a sports car, but performs like one as well and is disguised as an SUV, then get an X5 4.4I.

As for being to pricey; a "fully loaded" Land Cruiser is over $55,000, it's Lexus brother will put you over $60,000 and a Range Rover is in the mid 60's. These may all have more cargo space and even different whistles and bells, but I can tell you from my own personal experience that the X5 is the first suv to come along that would make me forget I needed a sports car too.  

I'm currently the owner of a BMW 850CSi which I think is the ultimate in a luxury sports car, but since getting my X5, I don't see myself putting near as many miles on my 850 as I did before. For me, the X5 is a combination of my 850 CSi and a utility vehicle all in one neat and very fast package. If you buy one, you won't be displeased!! 

If safety is an important factor in your decision making, the X5 also shines there as well.

When I first heard the SAV moniker instead of the SUV one for the X5, I was very skeptical, but now I agree and understand why BMW chose the SAV handle, and you will too, if you're lucky enough to own one of these wonderful and very powerful beasts.
