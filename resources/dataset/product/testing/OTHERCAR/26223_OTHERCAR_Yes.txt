            One cannot disagree that BMWs are the Ultimate Driving Machines.  Having seen the X5 earlier this year, I placed an order in Chicago on May 30th, and received the X5 some 7 weeks later.  Having upgraded from a 1993 E36, I must confess that the X5 team has outdone itself in refinement, beauty, grace and power.  This automobile truly embodies the spirit of the BMW Philosophy.

Imagine the luxury of the 540i, with technology superseding the 2000 M5, in a SAV package.  From the moment I picked up my vehicle, I have NO regrets in its purchase (despite having to pay sticker price)!!!!  This car is worth every penny.  I opted for every option but the Parking Distance Control (why would anyone need this?) and NAV computer- as a purist I believe an enthusiast who really enjoys driving wouldn't opt for one.  Besides, my VAIO laptop and PCS phone can also pinpoint my location on a map (dynamically) without relying on a system which requires the use of regional CD roms (and therefore, updates) to determine the location of the car.  I must say the 4.4i is the way to go (the 3.0 is underpowered -- having driven it in Chicago -- but certainly acceptable for those willing to drive the 6 cylinder model [which saves some $10K on the price]).

Simply put, this vehicle ROCKS.  Having read the other reviews, I must admit having the car for 36 hours, and having driven about 150 miles, I have had NO PROBLEMS and NO DIFFICULTIES.  The rear hatch/gate latches work fine in my vehicle.  The driving computer and radio system I find easy to read, and not a problem in sunlight for me.  The technology used in the driver-environment interface is beyond state-of-the-art, and rivals that of a 600 MB SL (certainly much better than a 300/400 MLK).  It drives like the 540i/M5.  There is NO BODY ROLL.  Not having broken in the engine, I have refrained from full throttle but can tell you the following:  this is one QUICK SAV (ok its not the AMG 55 [MLK] -- but who wants to do 0-60 in 4 seconds in an SUV anyway?)?  I can't wait for it to snow here, so I can see what this can really do!

The vehicle is outstanding.  I highly recommend it.  No complaints.  No regrets.  No suggestions. 

I bought the X5 in Chicago, and had it delivered in New Hampshire.  My wait period was about 6.5 weeks from order placement to delivery (the dealership in Chicago is the largest volume dealership in the Midwest, and possibly the US).  The BMW dealership here only sells about 200-300 cars/year, and its order-to-delivery time is about 8 months (which is unacceptable!)!!  Yet, there is something nice about having a unique car no one else has..............

Having driven the Range Rover, MLKs, Land Cruiser, Durango, and some of the other sports/utility vehicles, I must admit I could never drive anything other than the X5.  Nothing compares.  Period.
