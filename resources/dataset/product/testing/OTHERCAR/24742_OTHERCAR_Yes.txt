            The Sony DSC-S70 is the perfect camera for graphic professionals or for anyone who just likes to take pictures.  Having owned 3 previous Sony digital cameras, it has been interesting to see the changes from model to model.  First came the DSC-F1.  With its 640x480 resolution, it was limited in functionality, yet echoed the quality that Sony is known for.  Next came the DSC-F55.  Boasting great picture quality, and Sony's new memory stick, it was an amazing upgrade.  With the S70, more improvements abound.  With 6x digital zoom, you can see far away objects clearly.  (Optical 3X zoom is amazingly clear, but digital zoom tends to get fuzzy.)  Movie mode is also simply amazing.  In HQ mode, you can record at about 15fps in fairly high resolution with sound.  Sony's bundled 8MB mem stick is great, but you'll most likely find yourself going out and purchasing a 64MB one.  With many digital effects and long battery life (2-3 Hours) , the S70 is a sure winner!  I printed copies of high res tiffs with an epson photo 870, and no one could tell that it was not from a 35mm cam.     Buy this camera and you will be pleased! 
NOTE:  My biggest gripe before was that the camera was not win2000 compatible.  But since then, the win2000 drivers have been released, and I must say that I am happy as a clam!<br><br>
