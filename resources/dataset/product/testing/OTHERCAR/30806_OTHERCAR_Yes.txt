            After a lot of research, including of course reading epinions, I purchased this camera for Stan, my significant other, on his birthday. This in itself was not an easy feat. They were out of stock almost everywhere. Substitutes were offered and rejected. I prevailed and found one in stock on line.

Stan does not do computers, or much of anything that requires reading a manual (that's always my job). I read the manual, explained the basics, and he loves it! We use it for pleasure. We use it for business. See stanthejunkman.com. It is easy enough for Stan to take when visiting clients, when attending auctions and when we have on line requests for photos or items in our shop, whether it's a fancy cast iron fence or a piece of jewelry. It takes nice macro pictures of small items.<br><br>
