            I bought this particular camera from buy.com after doing a 3 day search across the web for my older parents.  My mom figured out how to use it in 2 hours.  My dad's only complaint is that the LED selection button is too <br>tiny for people who have large fingers and hands.  They did not want a high-end $ dig cam and this certainly qualified.  If you search rebate.com, there is also another $50 rebate on this camera.  I haven't bought them any accessories yet since I'm not sure they would know what to do with <br>them.<br><br><br>
