            I have a 1994 Dodge Ram Van B250 and it only has 33,000 miles on it.  While having some of the work done on the van, we noticed that the right rear leaf spring had come almost completely away from the mount which was cracked/torn almost completely off of the van. This posed a rather dangerous situation for all occupants of our van.  We had to have it fixed immediately. I consider this a manufacturing flaw. I couldn't even get the local Dodge dealer to handle it. Most body shops and welding houses didn't want to work on it either for one reason or another.  Finally I had to take it to a spring specialist to have the work done. A new piece was fabricated and the old one which was unusable was removed. The specialist said that it is a common problem with Dodge Vans.  It has to do with the quality and engineering of the vehicle.  It is a poor design and furthermore poor construction. I have also had problems with wind noise, tires and alignment and the air conditioner does not work.  The van didn't even have factory undercoating, so I had to have that done too! What ever you do, if you are considering the purchase of any Dodge or Chrysler product you must factor in that most of the components will fail much sooner than most other vehicles. Quality and customer service is at the bottom of the list. BUY A TOYOTA. My 1984 Toyota hasn't given me any problems.<br><br>
