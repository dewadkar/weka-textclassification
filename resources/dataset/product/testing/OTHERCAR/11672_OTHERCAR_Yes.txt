            I purchased a 1997 Legacy Outback Wagon at the end of 1997.  I am 6-foot-9, and was driving a Nissan X-cab pickup at the time.  I went looking for a car, but with my frame, it was very difficult (impossible) to find anything smaller than a Cadillac that would do the trick.  I tried all the SUVs:  Blazer, Explorer, Pathfinder, 4-runner, etc, but none of these had any more head room than my pickup.  On a whim, I stopped by the Subaru dealer and sat in an Outback, and was amazed at how much extra room I had.  Subaru has implemented a stepped-up roof in this model specifically to give it more head room, as well as to give it a more substantial, more SUV-like appearance.  Whatever the reason, I loved the car, and was soon test driving.  I bought it that night.  My dad had had a Subaru wagon when I was in high school, and I had liked it then, and this was much nicer than his had been.  I also liked the fact that it got 23-28 mpg (as opposed to the high teens-low 20s that I had seen in all the SUVs I had inspected).  Insurance was cheaper, and it was always in &quot;maximum traction mode&quot; rather than waiting for me to tell it the road was slippery.  Having driven this car for three years, I can honestly say that I am pleased with my decision.  I have to admit I balked a little at the idea of owning what is actually a station wagon.  I had always had pickups and SUVs.  I had a Grand Cherokee and an Explorer before the Nissan Pickup.  This seemed a little &quot;tame&quot; for me, and I wondered if it would be up to the demands I would place on it.  I can't say that it would or could go everywhere I used to go in my first vehicle - a 1987 Toyota 4WD, but then as I have matured, I don't have the desire to go some of those places, either.  My Outback will take me, my family, and all my stuff anywhere I have any business going. If you are one who likes to climb mountains in your vehicle, this is not for you.  If you are one who needs to get to your cabin or the ski resort year around, this is perfect for you. This car is similar to a sport sedan when I am on the highway, which is where most of us spend 80% of our driving time anyway. My pickup had a 3.0 liter V-6 engine, and peak horsepower was 160.  The Subaru has a 2.5 liter, but gets 165 horsepower.  It is not much of a race car, but the power is there when you need it. In the snow, it is everything (and more) that any of my other 4WDs were.  If you have seen the commercials, all I can say is that it is all true.  There is no puffery in them.  And let me say that I have never been &quot;embarrassed&quot; by my station wagon.  The Outback has just the right amount of &quot;ruggedness&quot; to make the statement that its owner is a person who enjoys the outdoors and takes advantage of all life has to offer.  At the same time, in this time of soaring oil prices and a substantial push for safer, more practical transportation, I am proud to be the owner of a vehicle that is exactly the right vehicle for me and my lifestyle.  Nothing more, nothing less.<br><br>
