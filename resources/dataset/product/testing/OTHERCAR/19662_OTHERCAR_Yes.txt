            My 1999 Saturn SL2 was the first car.  I originally looked at Saturns because they were relatively inexpensive and had a sporty look for a sedan.  I was very interested in finding a car with a lot of features, a great warranty and excellent service packages.  My Saturn is a manual transmission with a sunroof, power windows and doors, remote entry, an alarm system, and a CD player.  In addition, I have all service visits included in my monthly payments and a warranty with excellent coverage.  I have had no problems with my car since I purchased it and I have had no difficulties in dealing with Saturn personnel for my regular service visits.  

The thing that I least like about the car is that the back seat is not very large.  However, I did buy a compact sports sedan and to expect it to be large would be unreasonable.  

The thing that I love most about the car is its dent-resistance.  I have been hit by other drivers on two occasions since I bought my car and both times my car sustained no damages.  It wasn't even scratched.  

I think that this is a great car for anyone, but especially for first time car buyers.  It's economical in terms of its cost, gas mileage, and insurance.  It is also wonderful to not worry about paying for regular service with their Car Care Plan.<br><br>
