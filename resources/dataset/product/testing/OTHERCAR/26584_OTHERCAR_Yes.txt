            Off-road performance for those loyal 4RUNNER owners combined with the much improved on road manners and high tech safety features. 

This new design is very capable off-road without any modification(more aggressive tires are necessary for the rougher stuff). The V6 has incredible power and torque that will throw you back in the seat in 4 Lo. The only cons here are the kinda low ground clearance and tight wheel wells, but that limits only the true hardcore off-roader(who will find a way around to modify it). The traction control is very helpful, as are the hill assist and hill decent features. The Torsen type center differential provides better traction than a normal open type and it can be locked for maximum drive traction. The true enthusiast will probably want to install a rear locking differential and a 3" lift to make this a hardcore off-road machine.

On road the 4Runner is very well mannered and predictable. It's no sports car, but for a full frame truck it drives incredibly well. The V6 power and 4speed Tranny make me grin every time I "open it up"(especially in 4Hi because the traction control does not have to intervene)

The interior is roomy and has lots of cargo space. Seats are comfortable and supportive with a head rest and a 3point harness for all five seats. 

As for mileage I have heard others complain but thus far I have averaged 19-20 mpg, and on a long highway only drive have seen 23-24 mpg. I think that is incredible for a 245hp SUV.
