            This review is about my Elantra GT. I've only had it for a short time, so I'll have to update this review later -- don't forget while reading my review that these are really closer to "first impressions" than long term owner comments. 

I bought this car because I needed a car to carry my children in, as I couldn't put two carseats in my Ranger pickup, even with the supercab. I bought the GT version for the hatchback as I believe the extra cargo capacity will come in handy at times. 

The Car: 
2003 Hyundai Elantra GT 
Leather Seats 
Power Windows 
Power Locks

Power Moonroof 
AM/FM/CD, 6 speakers 
4 Wheel Disc Brakes 
5 speed manual 
2.0L 16 valve inline 4 cyl 
Keyless entry & Alarm 
Heated mirrors 
Rear defroster 
Rear wiper & washer 
Automatic headlights 
Speed sensitive power steering 
Highly Adjustable Driver's Seat (front & rear height and tilt, recline, lumbar adjustment) 

I've always been interested in cars and have followed a lot of manufacturer's cars, but never even considered Hyundai in the past. In fact, when I first started looking they didn't even cross my mind. A local radio station was doing a fund raiser called "Live in it to win it" where four people spent 18 days living in an Elantra at the dealership near my house, which made me look at them to see how much torture it must be to sit in a low priced import. When I started reading the reviews here, other owner reviews, and professional reviews I started to wonder if maybe Hyundai was an unknown gem. It appears that Hyundai is in a position of selling low to gain consumer confidence and market share! I suspect that if their reputation continues to improve like it has over the last few years they'll be considered right up there with Toyota and Honda soon, in fact Car & Driver magazine did a comparison between 10 cars of this price & size range and the Elantra beat both the Corolla and the Civic coming in second place! 

Driver's perspective: 

I'm about 6'3.5" and weigh about 200 lbs. My height is mostly proportioned towards long legs. So, how well do I fit in a Korean compact car? Quite well actually! The driver's seat travel is more than I need by about two inches, headroom is sufficient in both the front and back seats, even with the moonroof (my dad rode in it with his cowboy hat on!), seats are wide enough and comfortable and have good thigh support even for long legs. Good visibility on all sides and to the rear. The headlights cast a very bright well diffused light pattern. The dash is well laid out and easy to read. The purple back lighting is 'cool' looking, but a bit hard on the eyes after too long if it's too bright. The stereo has decent sound quality, though nothing to brag about. So far, no rattles or wind noise and even cruising at 65 MPH with the moon-roof open you can hear the radio just fine at a decent volume. Road noise is minimal for a car of this class. 

Rear legroom is good for this size car, even with the front seats all of the way back. I can sit in the back seat with acceptable comfort -- though probably not for a long trip. 

High points: 

* Comfortable, highly adjustable driver's seat 
* Decent legroom in the back 
* Cruise control pod is the best design I've ever seen 
* controls are well laid out 
* good cupholders with many configurations to hold nearly any cup securely, though a large cup may make it difficult to shift. 
* 'dummy pedal' to rest your left foot on when not shifting. 
* Good handling 
* Decent acceleration, especially once it's wound up to it's 3000 to 4000 rpm peak. 
* I drove it with nearly 800 lbs of people (3 large adults and two children in carseats) and you could hardly tell the difference -- it still felt peppy and fast and handled well. 
* Big rear view mirrors for a small car 
* Massive cargo capacity with rear seats folded down and hatch area filled. 

A few minor niggles: 

No matter what kind of car you drive, there's going to be something you don't like. I have a few of those, though so far I've found far fewer than my fully loaded Chrysler Town & Country minivan that cost a bundle more than this car. They are also VERY MINOR complaints: 

1) The ignition key is a bit hard to insert, though I'm getting used to it and it goes in fairly easy now. 
2) The hood release is where I'm used to having the brake release. Haha... I'll get used to that after I get out to close the hood a few more times. Actually, I like the hand brake better than a foot brake. 
3) The interior lighting is insufficient -- the dome light only lights the front seats (the GLS sedan does not have this problem), and the light in the hatch area is very dim. 
4) The last door closed has to be closed firmly or it'll not latch all of the way 
5) As with almost every car I've ever driven, the visors obstruct my vision to the front since I'm so tall, and don't cover enough of the side window to be any use since I sit so far back. 
6) I worry that the power mirrors won't last too long as they move in a jerky fashion. 

So far I'm very impressed with this car, and think I've definitely made the right decission. I hope to seldom need the warranty, but if I do it looks promising. 

I'll update this review in a few months once I've put a few more miles on the car.
