            Though most Durango's are driven by suburban mothers, this midsize sport/ute is very capable. With the ability to hold up to 7 passengers, or lots of groceries, this is a very large &quot;truck&quot;. With many different engine and drivetrain choices, you can customize your Durango to your needs. Any thing from the 3.9L v6 to the 5.9L v8. in between is the new 4.7L v8 from the grand cheroke. I personally recomend the 4.7L v8, it provides DECENT gas milage yet very similar power to the 5.9L v8. Also you can opt for 2wd or 4wd, to further customize it to your needs. The durango has tons of options and the ability to hold 24 drinks. 
Be ready to hike up into the durango too, because it has a high step in height. once inside, the durango is laid out very basicly, but also functionaly. The one major downside I have found with the Durango is its truck feel. It rides harsh, and likes to lean slightly in turns, but nothing that is unnearving.  The Durango is more than capable to do anything you want it to.<br><br>
