            After seeing some photos blown up by a friend who had a higher res camera, I was ready for an upgrade, but being the thrifty shopper I am, I was not willing to part with 600.00 for one like his. So I picked up a SIPIX SC3300 on sale for 149.00 after rebate at Compusa in Jan 2003. 

The SC3300 is my second digital camera and has performed as expected so far but I plan to test it for durability under diverse light and weather conditions on my next ski trip later this month. Also see my review of my first digital camera the SC1300, elswhere on epinions.

There are no doubt other camera's on the market that can capture artist quality photo's due to a higher grade lens, and other highly grade components, but hey-this thing costs 149.00. When I become a photo-journalist, I will spend more on a digital camera, until then this camera at suits me fine.
 
It takes Compactflash memory cards of which I already had a 64Mb card from my old camera, but with the higher resolution (and hence, bigger file sizes) of this camera I decided to get a 128Mb card to supplement. At the highest res of 3.3 with low compression, the camera says on the view screen it will hold 73 photos on the 128 Mb card. Now this # may be also counting the 16Mb the camera contains on board, not sure. When on a long trip, I would borrow my mother's 64mb card to supplement even more. But for everyday around the house photo taking, even the 16Mb on board will take 10-15 high res photos, even more with the high res of 3.3, but high compression setting.

I urge you to read the manual for this camera for details on use and care. It will make clear a great many things.
 
The LCD screen is brighter and easier to see outside than my previous camera but can be turned off if You press the display button three times in a row; The green indicator light will remain lit letting you know the camera itself is still on and ready to take photos. (LCD off really saves battery), but the LCD comes right back on when you snap a picture so you have to be diligent about turning it off when not needed to save battery. 

The shutter is trickier too, with half a press to pre-focus, then hold down to snap. The photos are very nice when pre-focus is used, but it's sometimes hard to catch action with that feature, but I found that I could just press all the way down, and skip the pre-focus option to get a faster shutter response.
 
I do not use the zoom, because it is digital and not optical on this camera. (digital zoom is not helpful, as it lowers the resolution of the photo in order to make it appear closer-so do not use it! just get closer to the object instead)

The SC3300 has a more protected on/off switch than my previous camera. We shall see if I can get it turned on/off with ski gloves on, but at least it won't turn itself on in the case and drain the battery.

Recovery of flash after each shot is a little slower than I would like, but maybe that's because I am more demanding now. It's not any longer a wait than the amount of time it used to take to wait for the film to advance in a 35mm camera though so it's ok.
 
The SC3300 takes only two AA batteries instead of 4-AA like with my old camera, so it's lighter and smaller, but the battery life is reduced proportionatly. Technically It does not use any more battery than expected to do it's job, but since there are only 2 batteries you have to change them more often. Be sure to get those NiMY recharable batteries and keep plenty of extra charged and ready to use at all times. 

Get medieval on battery issues!
Get a smallish 1 hour NiMhY fast charger that can hold 2 to 4 batteries total and that has an indictor when the batteries are fully charged, and stops charging when fully charged regardless of whether it's plugged in or not. Buy a total of 8 NiMhY batteries to start, an extension cord, and a camera carry case that will fit the camera, battery charger, all 8 batteries, a short lightweight std. extension cord, extra memory cards, and the usb upload cable inside it. Carry all this with you when you go out with the camera. Plug the charger in anywhere you see an outlet-the food court at the mall, the airport, your hotel room, a restaurant, your friend's house, the local sports bar, etc. I do this and in return I get an abundance of priceless photos to keep and share. Many more than I could get using a 35mm camera. It's worth the effort.

I hope you enjoy your digital camera as much as I do. 
Good luck!


Update after several months of use and a ski vacation trip:

As I expected, the batteries had to be changed quite alot and this was not a small task when faced with taking of my ski gloves to do so. But this is normal. 

I did appreciate the lighter weight and smaller size of this camera. It was easy to tuck it into my jacket sleeve and ski with it and then break it out for a quick shot on the way down. 

The power button was possible to turn on/off with the gloves on, but not easy-however, I did not have the accidental power on problem as with the SC1300 model camera I had before so this was ok.

The photos were of good quality at 3.3 mega pixels, mostly clear and with good color. However, there were a few times when I let strangers use it to takes pictures of us together, and those are not as clear. Probably because the person taking the photo did not know how to operate the auto focus shutter like I did, and they moved before the snap was complete. 

I did use the video movie function to film us skiing down the hill and it was the coolest! The res is low, of course and it eats up some memory space but those short movies are priceless! 

Ok so fast forward 8 months. 

The camera always had a little problem with the batteries being hard to get out so I always had to rap it on the table edge to get them out. I thought it was just my brand of batteries but all brands were like that. 
Well now I'm having a problem with the camera turning itself off after only a second, even when I know the batteries are fully charged because I jsut took them out of the charger and/or they are relatively new alkalines. Also, sometimes it won't power on at all, so I fiddle and fiddle and I take out the batteries and put them back in and it works fine for a while. So I am having to send it back for service now. We will see if they can fix it. 

More later.
