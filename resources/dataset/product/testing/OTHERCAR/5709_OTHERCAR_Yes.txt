            The Acura Integra is by far the most fun compact sports car I have driven!! I own a 1994 Ls which I love. I bought this car last year for about $9,000 and it is worth every penny. The Ls is the non-vtec honda engine, however at 140 horsepower it is still faster than most cars of a comparable price range such as the Mitsubishi Eclipse and Honda Civic which were my other two cars of interest.

The main reason that I bought an Integra is that with a few modifications, you can turn a car that is already quick, into a FAST car. Since the car is fairly inexpensive, I was left with some money to sink into parts. I began by adding a $500 Greddy aftermarket racing exhaust which gave me an extra 5-7 hp gain. I then bought DC Sports ceramic headers which add about 15 hp for $300. Last but not least, by taking off the factory air box and adding a $45 K&amp;N air filter I got another 5 hp.

So, with a few simple bolt-on modifications and a little time, you can turn your Acura Integra into a extremely fun machine. This is a great car all around. It gets great gas mileage around 25 - 30 mpg and that is with my modifications and abusive driving habits. The biggest reason that I like it thought is that it is fast. My friends and I have spent many a weekend racing other kids and the Integra is hard to beat, plus for those long highway drives, I have hit a top speed of 135 mph!!! I wouldn't recommend trying this though until you upgrade your suspension and add larger and wider wheels and tires as I have done.

In conclusion, I love my Integra. I would highly recommend it to anyone. It is great for the business commuter who is looking for a reliable car that gets good gas mileage. It is also a fast car that is tons of fun for the weekend racer.<br><br>
