            My 1991 cavalier went into the shop recently. And they gave me a '99 cavalier as a rental to get me around. I found it was just as comfortable as my old cavlier. But they have made many improvements. I am not sure about the gas mileage, if it is the same or has gotten better. But, I found the handling to be much better. Being that it was just a rental, I took advantage of it, and pushed the car to its limit's. For a little old 4 cylinder the car had some nice pick-up to it. It could get out of it's own way. The handling was surperb. The 1 and only complaint I have about this car, which has been the same through the years. There is no leg room in the back seat. The car really seems to be a 2 seater, with a shelf in the back to put your groceries. If you plan on having a family or friends travel with you.
