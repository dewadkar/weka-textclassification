            We bought a 1999 Saturn SW-2 wagon in October of 1998.  We had a XLT Ford Ranger but I was expecting and due in January so it had to go.  Since we have 2 dogs (one small &amp; one medium) adding a car seat to the mix made a wagon seem like a great idea.  Keep every one seperate and every one happy.  

To date we still have the car and it has 27000 miles on it.  It has been to Missouri and back in less than a year and is just fine.  I love all the cargo space because it is terrific for those trips to the store when you impulse shop and end up with a new stroller or lawnmower.  

The stereo system that came with the car is a good one.  All the digitals are easy to read at night and during the day.  The driving lights are great-I know other drivers can see me.  The seats are bucket seats and have lumbar support which is great on a long drive.  The steering wheel adjusts for shorter people (I'm 5'4&quot;) and the console keeps drinks within easy reach.  We didn't get auto locks, windows or mirrors or cruise control.  A few sacrifices to keep the price down.  

The couple of bad things that I can think of to date are that the car didn't come with any cup holder liners or extenders, there isn't a &quot;sun blinder bar&quot; going across the top of the windshield and the dashboard is a dark muted black which is great for sucking up all the sun and heat and making the car wicked hot after just 20 minutes of sitting in the sun.  Also, when you have a cup in the cup holder the gear shift is too close to the cup-makes it difficult sometimes to get the cup out.  

We both like driving the car as it is a nice change from driving a truck.  It handles well and responds quickly compared to that.  Maybe not as quick as other cars but coming from a truck it is a big difference.  The other big change coming from driving a truck is that it took a while to get used to being so low.  I have noticed that big rigs have a tendency not to notice a navy blue station wagon also.  Even when you are in the &quot;safety zone&quot;.  

Overall it is a good family car and has a lot of room for a wagon in it's category.  <br><br>
