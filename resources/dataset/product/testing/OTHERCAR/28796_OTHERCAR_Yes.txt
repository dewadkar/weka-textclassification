            The Chevrolet Lumina LTZ is one of, if not the the best automobile purchase that a consumer can make.  When I first started my car shopping experience, I first went to my trusty computer.  I searched high and low for every possible make and model of car that fit into my price range and size.  I found information on the Ford Tauras, the Toyota Camry, the Pontiac GrandAm, and the Buick SkyHawk.  All the information that I received did not give me enough information to make a full fledged opinion on one car over another.

Finally, I went down and test drove all the  cars that I had gotten information on.  I was starting to get frustrated with the whole car experience.  This was until I came upon the right car.  I went to the Chevrolet Dealership and told them what kind of car I was looking for, a sporty, roomy, good mileage, and last but not least POWER.  So many times you can find a car with three of the four requests but to find a car with all four, I started to think that I was in a dream and at any moment someone was going to wake me.  

After test driving this car, I was completely convinced that I had found the perfect car.  Then came the hard part, convincing my husband.  After all my ideal car may not be my husband's ideal car.  I went home and started telling him all that I had found.  I first started with the POWER issue.  

I finally was able to get him to go down for a test drive.  After one mile he was convinced more than I was.  We then proceeded to purchase the car with all the bells and whistles possible.  The dealership and GMAC financing were just wonderful, but that's another review.
