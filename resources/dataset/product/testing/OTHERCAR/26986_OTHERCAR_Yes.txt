            My mother bought her 1993 Toyota previa new, and faithfully drove me and the rest of our family around in it for six years.  Throughout these six years, it traveled over 100k miles, needed only one major repair, was very reliable, and was all around wonderful.  I personally learned how to drive in this car, and when my mother had a midlife crisis and decided to buy a lexus(IE Toyota with class) I was happy to take the Previa off her hands.  The Previa has exceeded all my expectations of the car and has everything I, as a high-school student needs in a car.  It has enough space so I can cart around my friends or my drums when I play for the school band.  It is VERY safe, and fortunately, due to its wonderful control and tremendous reliability, I have never had to personally test any of the safety features.  I would recommend this car to anyone who does not need speed or an &quot;image&quot; car.  This car is perfect for getting you from home to school to work to friends houses.  The only drawback to owning this(and any other minivan) is the low gas milage, however that drawback is more than made up by the reliability and safety that it has.  <br><br>
