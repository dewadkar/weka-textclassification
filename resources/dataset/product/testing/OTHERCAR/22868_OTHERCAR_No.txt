            I purchased the QV-200 in Hong Kong when I was on a trip overseas and needed a quick, easy way to send photos back to the US via email.  This camera fit the bill.  I purchased the camera in December 1998.  At the time, I paid about $120 for it, but I could've done better, if I had the time to bargain.

This camera has two modes of operation, 240 x 320 and 480 x 640.  I have never purposely used the lower of the resolutions.  The camera stores about 64 photos at the higher resolution, which is more than a normal person really needs at any time.  If you need more, take your computer with you and download the photos when you exceed the limit.

The pluses of the camera are the superb photos you can get in the macro mode.  So, if you need close ups, this camera can do the job.  I've gotten quite a few comments on the clarity and detail in this mode.  The software I received with the camera included a great utility for pasting multiple photos together to get panoramas.  I would have paid the purchase price for this alone.

The minuses are much greater.  You can't add memory to the camera.  This is not a great problem, as the 60 picture limit stated earlier still applies. There is no flash with this camera.  Without adequate ambient light, you may as well leave the camera in the case.  The resolution of distance photos is very poor.  Any subject more than 6 feet away blurs noticeably due to the limited number of pixels.  If you are in a high ambient light condition, then the display is hard to see.  Now you see a real problem; too little light and the pictures are bad, too much and you can't see the display.

All in all, I'd say that you can do better for the money.<br><br>
