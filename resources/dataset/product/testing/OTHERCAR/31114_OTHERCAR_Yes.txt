            <b>WRITE-OFF for ROADIEM</b>

We purchased a 1994 Jeep Cherokee 4X4 Sport truck to use as a recreational vehicle.  We have had excellent luck with our "truck".  We have had it a couple of years and it has given us nothing but worry free service.

Our 1994 Jeep Cherokee Sport has 4 wheel drive and a 4.0 litre engine.  This Jeep has an automatic transmission and shift on the fly four wheel drive.


<b>4x4 FEATURE</b>

4X4- Our 1994 Jeep Cherokee Sport 4 wheel drive is enacted by slowing to around 15 mph.  Next to the automatic transmission lever is the 4 wheel drive engagement lever.  The truck is easily engaged in 4 wheel drive without any hubs to lock or anything else to deal with.  Recently, we took it off road in an area of dirt with steep inclines.  The Jeep crawled around with ease over mounds and up the steep inclines.  The Jeep had plenty of power to handle any of the terrain we fed it. 

We have used it in the snow and it handled small depths of snow with ease.  We have found it is very convenient to go into the mountains and not have to put on chains while everyone else is chaining up.


<b>ENGINE and TRANSMISSION</b>

Our 1994 Jeep Cherokee Sport came with a 4.0 Litre, six cylinder engine.  It has provided plenty of power at all times.  Even in 4 wheel drive the engine provides plenty of power (my husband said it is torque?) for great climbing ability.  The transmission is a three speed automatic that shifts smoothly and works very well in 4 wheel drive.


<b>INTERIOR</b>

Our 1994 Jeep Cherokee Sport has front bucket seats and a bench backseat.  The interior leg room in the front seat area is excellent.  The backseat could be a little bigger but it is not cramped.  The seats are cloth and they have held up very well.  

The instruments are easily visible during the day and even more visible at night.  The field of vision for the driver is very good.  The Jeep sits up very high and I love driving it in traffic because I can see everywhere.

The vehicle Air Conditioner works very well.  The heating and defrost system also work well.  The defroster is very powerful and clears a steamed up windshield in seconds.  The rear window has a windshield wiper feature that helps visibility in extreme conditions.


<b>MILEAGE</b>

Our Jeep is averaging about 16 miles per gallon.  On the highway it gets about 20 miles per gallon.  With the increasing gas prices that is not the best mileage but it isn't bad for a 4X4 either.  Sometimes our city mileage runs as low as 12 miles per gallon.  Our gas mileage 
decreases in the summer with the air conditioner on. 

Overall I am very pleased with my Jeep Cherokee.  It has been a dependable vehicle that we can always rely on.  We have had very good luck with ours and I think it would make a dependable used vehicle for someone.
