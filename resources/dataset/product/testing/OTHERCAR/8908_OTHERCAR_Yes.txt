             All my life i dreamed of owning exotic sports roadsters. When i was 28, I realized hat dream. It's not as nice as some, but when i saw this Ferrari Mondial T convertible at a local car show with a FOR SALE sign on it, i knew i had to have it. I inquired to the owner about the price, and, finding that it was slightly out of my range, borrowed some money from various friends (which i am still paying off. 

 I am now 30, and for 2 years the car has been my release; my escape from life's troubles. Most any fast convertible will do that for you, but it takes a Ferrari like mine to hit that certain level of comfort. 
 
 I've added a lot of custom extras to my car. It now has 20&quot; wheels, a SONY cd stereo system, and a slightly rounded figure. This car, like any Ferrari, draws the babes. No matter how ugly you are, or how geeky you were in high-school, when you're in this car, you're SOMEBODY. The big 
v-8 doesn't quite have the powerful launch of todays supercars, but in a small town like mine, this powerhouse of yester-year provides ample power.
