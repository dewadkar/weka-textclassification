            I was in search of a truck that was affordable, dependable, and an eye-catcher.  I was having problems with my small compact car and began comparison shopping pick-up trucks.  When I came across the Nissan Frontier, I really like what it had to offer.  I got mine with a value package which included air, floor mats, bed liner, sliding rear window, tinted privacy glass, and cassette player.  I purchased the King Cab XE and it came with rear ABS brakes standard which definitely makes me feel safer.  I also like the chrome bumpers which really make the Frontier stand out and shine!

I like the extra space that that the King Cab provides which allows me to throw just about anything in it that fits back there.  The extra seats are great for small children but would be a hassle for adults.  For a single person as myself, this vehicle fits all of my needs.  I used to wonder what I would do with a truck but now I realize that it is great to have.  If I ever need to haul anything I have the large bed to do so and I also love the height of the truck which allows for greater visibility.  I have received many compliments on the Frontier.  I would recommend it to anyone shopping for a new truck.  I love my Frontier!<br><br>
