            The time had finally come.  I promised my daughter that when she became a senior in college she would get her own car.  So as her junior year came to end she spend many hours &quot;researching&quot; different cars.  And to say the least I was so surprised when she picked the 2000 Alero.  My first reaction was who makes it and how much is it?  When she told me Oldsmobile I said no way would a &quot;kid&quot; want an Olds.  

Well, we made what I thought would be an awful trip to the car dealer and I was hit with one surprise after another.  The car was really great looking, the price was less than I thought it would cost me and the salesman was actually quite nice.

We looked at the GL3 with the R7T option package.  This car comes with the V-6 engine, an upgrade I really wanted.  My daughter added a few of her options...(cd player, rear spoiler) and when I was quoted a price I was pleasantly surprised.  I asked the dealer if he would accept this &quot;online coupon&quot; I printed out from the site (www.oldsmobile.com)that was valued at $750. and he said sure.  In addition I received a factory rebate of another $725 and therefore knocked off $1475 off the price!

The car has been trouble free, my daughter is in love with her car and with all these rebates I am too!<br><br>
