            My husband went out to buy a pair of shoes and he came home with a  1998 Grand Marquis.  

We have three children and I had been driving a Dodge, Caravan for 10 years.  I had always made comments that I wanted a luxury car and right now this is as close as we could get. 

I thought I might miss the room in the mini-van but the Marquis has proven itself to be extremely roomy.  I especially love the huge trunk.  We actually got all of the kids Christmas presents from Grandmas and family into the trunk.  This is something the mini van couldn't even deliver.  

After a long day of shopping there's nothing like slipping into the leather seats that mold and massage you as you float along the road.  

With three small children the car gets a real work out with food, dirt and other interesting substances.  The leather seats clean up remarkably well (at least my husband says they do).  I feel very safe driving this car.  At first, I didn't like the sensitivity I felt in the steering of the car but I have adapted and really enjoy the maneuverability it has.  I also applaud the ability to park the car with ease in any parking spot.

The only negative I can think of is that it doesn't handle very well on the wet, steep hills here in Seattle.
 
I mostly see elderly people driving this type of car but it has been an excellent family car so I would recommend it to just about anyone.<br><br>
