   A Lexus Sport Utility Vehicle. Now theres a product born out of a marketing department, not a design team. Built on the renowned off-road platform that is the Camry, this SUV also uses the same engine as the best selling family car. Than you tell me: &quot;BUT IT HAS ALL THAT CHROME AND GOLD PAINT!!! IT IS WAAAAY BETTER!!!&quot; Sure. In the grand Lexus tradition of having no styling heritage this model includes a headlight configuration which more closely resembles the tail of the &quot;Battle-Star Galactica&quot; than a functional design based in logic. Its hard to believe this vehicle is selling so well, but than I remember that these are the same people who sport &quot;Fur kills&quot; stickers while ordering the leather package on this fine wilderness conquering machine. Did I mention a Camry costs half as much? If you're looking to impress the entire viewing audience of &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; than this is the ride for you. If your looking for something with purpose as its primary design priority check out a Land Cruiser. But if you were considering the RX-300 you probably won't ever leave the safety of freshly laid asphalt, so please save yourself some money and mockery and buy a car. God forbid you buy a  vehicle without an acronym  for a title!!! Or for $50 I'll paint your Kia Sportage 6 shades of bronze and put throw a gold kit on it. Wait, make that $39,000...... <br><br>
