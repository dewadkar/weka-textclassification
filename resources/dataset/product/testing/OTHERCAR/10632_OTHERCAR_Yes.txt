            Before you leap into the Odyssey abyss with all of the other lemmings, there are compelling reasons to buy the Sienna.

Price:
Currently entering its seventh model year, it's easy to negotiate a tremendous discount from MSRP, which brings the street price of a loaded Sienna XLE in line with the MSRP of a similarly equipped Honda Odyssey EX with leather (no DVD).  (Supplies of the Odyssey are catching up with demand here in the Pittsburgh area, and dealers are quoting MSRP or slightly less).  After doing my homework, I bought our new 2003 Sienna XLE for $1,000 below invoice (including rebate) over the telephone in less than fifteen minutes.

Features:
The leather interior of our new Sienna XLE is downright Lexus-like.  The Odyssey's interior (even with leather) is merely Accord-like.  The Sienna's dashboard and thick, leather-wrapped steering wheel are color-matched to the rest of the interior.  The Odyssey's dash and wheel are basic black.  Other nice touches exclusive to the Sienna include a dash-mounted ignition swich (where it should be), heated side-view mirrors, and an excellent eight-speaker JBL Premium Sound System with 5-disc in-dash CD changer.  

Every-day driving:
The Sienna drives like a Camry, and is just the right size for our family of four.  It's easy to maneuver, and its smooth and quiet ride really eats up the interstate miles.  The larger Odyssey is much more van-like, and is a real garage hog.  

Downside:
The Sienna is showing its age, styling-wise.  But since there's no such thing as a stylish or trendy minivan, what's the difference?  As the model run comes to a close, Toyota seems to be equipping all XLE's with the same option bundles.  The dual power doors and leather I wanted were only available without the headroom-robbing sunroof by special order. Finally, the original equipment Firestone Affinity tires are horrible on anything but dry pavement.  Do yourself a favor and either negotiate upgraded replacements before you buy, or stop at Costco's tire center on your way home from the dealer and consider it cheap insurance.
