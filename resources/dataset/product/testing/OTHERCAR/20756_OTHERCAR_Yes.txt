            When I was pregnant, I decided that it was time to chuck the Geo Metro I had (AKA: &quot;Deathmobile&quot;) and purchase a family car. After going through a careful selection process, I decided on the Chevy Blazer. I bought one that was used (a '98 in 1999).

As a family car, it's fantastic. I have plenty of room to lug stuff around, including a stroller and various baby paraphernalia. Even with the car seat in the back seat, a couple more people can squish into the back.

The best part, though, is that in the winter, I'm able to get around while few other cars can. I live in the Midwest, where winters are really nasty, and I've been able to park in snow mounds and still get out easily. It's great.

The cons? Well, there's something wrong with the 4-wheel drive. While in 2-wheel drive, the car suddenly becomes possessed occasionally and shifts into 4-wheel drive on it's own. I was told this was a flaw with all '98 Blazers, so be careful! It also has stalled, which isn't good with a one-year old car. On top of those things, I had to have a front light replaced because water was getting into it, and the lever to put the front seat forward broke off easily.

Should you buy it? Here's my advice: If you live in a harsh winter climate, or you need a SAFE family vehicle, I think the pros definitely outweigh the cons. If you live in a hot climate and you're childless, buying an SUV is kinda silly.

In any case, I'd make sure the car still has a warranty on it (I didn't have to pay for my repairs).

Happy car hunting!
