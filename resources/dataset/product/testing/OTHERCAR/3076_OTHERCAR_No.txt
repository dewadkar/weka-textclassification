            In 1996 i purchased a dodge intrepid since then i have put 60.000 miles on it and have had 4 major and costly breakdowns such as blown head gaskets, air conditioning overhaul, water pump,tie rods, timing belt,cv joints, and now there is a problem with the transmission.I have spent 4 thousand dollars trying to keep this car on the road only to battle it out with some fly by night warranty company whos motto is &quot;everything is driver error&quot;  I bought this car as a family car and it has stranded my family along side the highway 3 times.I would not recommend this car to my worst enemy.Its my opinion that diamler-chrysler is all about cash and not quality.I like nothing about this vehicle. Anybody who purchases this car will be sorry they did.10-4 over and out! <br><br>
