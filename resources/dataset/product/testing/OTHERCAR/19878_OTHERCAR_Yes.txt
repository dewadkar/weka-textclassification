            I recently quit my job as a rep for Hewlett Packard but not before I purchased my C30.  I just wanted a decent camera that I could take decent photos with.  I knew all the specs about the c30 having been a rep.  I know that the lens is glass not plastic as some other cameras are.  I know that you HAVE  to have at LEAST a megapixel to get a decent photo.  It does use batteries quickly though so I just usually take photos like a regular point and shoot then if it is a picture that I will never be able to get again, view it.  If it is just a cute snapshot, I usually wait till I get home and then view it on my tv.  That is a very nice feature.
It is light and easy to carry with you.
I love my camera!

Pair this camera up with the HP P1000 series printer and you have a great system.  No computer needed!  You just take out your memory chip and stick it in the printer and instant photos.  Electricity is all that is needed for the printer. 

This camera is great for the beginner.  If you are just getting into digital photography or just need a camera that produces great photos and not a lot of adjustments - this camera is for you.  There is a new one out that is the C200 that is almost the exact same camera.  $100.00 less.
The only difference is the case is made out of a different material and it does not include the power cable or Picture It by Microsoft.  We can all live without Picture It but the power cable is important.
