             I started out writing this review with an attempt to discuss just how easy the DX3700 was to operate.  As I was working my way through the different options and features, which as you will see goes on for quite a long while, it occurred to me �WOW there is an awful lot going on here, am I really going to tell people that a three page descriptive essay of features is EASY�?  After thinking about it some more the answer is YES.  And this is the best thing I can think to say about the DX3700.  Read on if you would like to learn more about the individual features and some available options, but the bottom line is being stated right here up front, this camera is compact, easy to use and extremely feature rich, taken together it is joy to own.  The picture quality is exceptional and have I mentioned it�s easy to use?  Onward to my exhaustive review.
I received the Kodak EasyShare DX3700 camera as a gift and have been thrilled with it ever since.  Kodak has done a fine job stressing the EASY when it comes to this camera.  Out of the box anyone can get set up and taking quality digital photographs in less than an hour.  This model camera is sold in two versions, one that includes a docking station and one that does not.  The docking station sells for $79.00 so if you see a big difference in the price of this camera between two retailers its most likely the two different configurations being sold.  I received the base camera without the docking station.

Out of the box you receive 1) the camera itself, 2) a camera strap, 3) a lens cap, 4) a battery, 5) a docking station insert, 6) a UBS interface cord, 7) an instruction book, 8) a CD-ROM, 9) A RCA interface cable.  As you can see there are quite a few pieces yet nothing unexpected, unless you want to include the EasyShare docking station insert in that category.  DO NOT THROW THIS UNASSUMING PIECE OF PLASTIC AWAY, if you opt to later obtain a docking station you will need this piece to match your camera to the universal docking station.  Without even opening the instruction book you can pretty much figure out what each included piece is used for, and within minutes you are closing in on taking pictures.  The actual picture taking process is not much more difficult.
	First a quick tour of the camera�s body.  This reveals that there is a lot going on, yet it all makes simple sense.  Much like any other camera the DX3700�s front includes a lens, and built in flash.  There are two small doors on the sides of the body, one is the housing for the battery the other is a slot for an MMC or Multimedia Memory Card (more on this later).  There are also two additional ports; one is a UBS port, which accepts the enclosed UBS cord necessary for the transfer of pictures from memory to your PC.  The other port is a RCA output port; this port is used if you want to display your pictures onto a television for the viewing pleasure of many.  There are several items located on the rear of the camera.  There are 3 buttons (Power, Select, and Delete) and a large multi-directional thumb sized button as well as a three-position slide switch.  Additionally there is a small digital viewing screen.  Of course there is also a button on top for when you actually want to take a photo, and a tripod adapter slot on the bottom.  That�s it, sounds like a lot, but not really right?
	After flying through the preliminaries, hooking on the camera strap and lens cap, putting in the battery, your ready to fire up the camera and see the basics of what it can do.  One note about turning the camera on and off, it takes a long time.  You must push and hold the button, the camera runs a memory check before returning the green ready light.  It is a bit maddening if you�re hot to take a �quick� picture, but apparently this is what must be done when dealing with a digital medium.  The first time you turn on the camera you will be required to enter the date and time.  Upon finishing that you are ready to point and shoot, Easy as that.  Now you may opt to change some of the settings and this will require a bit more reading of the manual or a lot more playing around with the menu based option screens.  There are a lot of options available to you, which bring us to a discussion of the menu based option screens.  
At this point I would like to discuss the feature menu that drives the formats of the photos you will be taking.  Since this is a digital camera you are allowed to adjust things like the image quality, date coding, flash options, red eye reduction and playback options.  All of these options are controlled via a digital user interface displayed via the digital screen on the back of the camera.  By using the select button and the directional thumb button you can work your way through multiple menus to find and select the picture taking options you desire.  These menus are pretty straight forward, and once set will not change until you want them too.  I would love to say that this was the easiest part of the camera but sadly it isn�t.  Kodak has done a good job of trying to make these menu�s as straight forward as possible, but there is just a lot of options and information here which makes it the most important and most complex part of the camera.  Overall these options menus are well laid out and useful, it just takes a while to read through the directions and select the right option settings for your situation.  The upside is that once you set these options to match your preference you don�t have to mess with them again unless you want to.  
Taking pictures, as mentioned is as easy as pointing and shooting, holding the shutter button half way down allows the camera to focus, pushing it down a bit further snaps the photo.  Upon taking the picture you will notice that it is immediately shown on the digital view screen on the back of the camera.  It is viewable there for about five seconds.  This is a feature that may be turned off, but is a feature that I find ultimately useful. With the display on you are able to immediately decide wither or not this is a �keeper� or one that needs to be retaken.  You can then delete it or re-shoot it while the subject is still there.  Too cool for words and its very useful if it�s a one-time photo-op.  One downside with this feature is the small size of the view screen.  While I have very little trouble seeing weather or not my subjects are blinking or looking the wrong way, my mother and father whose vision is not quite as good complain that they really cannot make these small features out on the tiny screen.  Something to keep in mind if your buying this camera for someone whom may have trouble seeing images on such a small scale.
Button manipulation is needed to take pictures via the zoom mode, and if I have a peeve with this camera here it is.  I find the digital zoom to be quite annoying to use, unlike many conventional cameras there is no focus lever that allows you to zoom in while looking at your subject.  With the DX3700 you must once again negotiate the cameras menus to activate the zoom.  My feeling is that activating the zoom  is too troublesome and time consuming, you are bound to miss the photo opportunity while your setting it up.  If your taking several photos and are not on the move I am sure this feature is more than adequate however.  As you may be able to tell I don�t mess with it much at this point, I just find it to be too much of a hassle.
After taking photos you will undoubtedly want to view and review them and there are three methods for doing so.  The first requires you to have a computer, not a stretch now days, and if its less than three years old you probably have adequate resources available to install and run the software.  The necessary software is included with the camera and upon putting the CD-ROM into your CD-ROM drive will more or less install itself.  Simple as that.  You will then need to connect the included UBS connector into the back of your computer using you guessed it an available UBS port.  That was the hard part.  Now all that is left is to plug the other end of the UBS Cable into the designated slot on your camera, and turn the camera on.  Your pictures will then automatically transfer to your computer.  By opening the Kodak Picture Software you will be able to view, edit, save and send (Internet connection needed) your pictures to your friends and family.  You can also print them, however the quality will be dependent on the type of printer you have and the quality of paper you use.
An alternate method for viewing your pictures is to connect the included RCA cable into your TV.  It is color-coded Yellow and depending on your TV may be able to be connected to the front or back.  After connecting your TV and camera, and turning both on you will be able to view your pictures through your TV.  The only downside to this is that the pictures will have to be viewed as taken, so if you took a picture while turning the camera on its end, it will be displayed sideways.  You can however zoom in on the photo by hitting the select key, and move around the photo using the thumb pad.  This is useful if you just want to get a bit of a closer look at a face or a smaller item in the background.  The big upside here is that if you take this camera away with you on vacation, you can bring the cord and at night review the days photos on the big screen of a TV where all can see.  Additionally you can delete any photos you don�t like after having a good look at them.
The third method for getting your pictures is to take the camera to a digitally equipped photo store and have them �develop� your photos for you.  They will basically download your photos and print them out on there equipment.  In a twist on this you can upload your photos onto your computer then go to the Kodak website.  They provide a service (Ofoto) that allows you to upload your photos and have them printed professionally.  The prints are they sent to your home.  I like this option because it allows me the flexibility of seeing my photos, selecting the best ones, and editing them the way I want them while still obtaining high quality prints.
As you can see there are a lot of options available with digital photography, and the DX3700.  In line with this I want to discuss some of the optional equipment available for the DX3700.  First and most important is additional memory.  The DX3700 comes with 8mb of internal memory.  Since your using a digital camera, the amount of photos you can take is directly related to the amount of memory available.  Similarly the quality of the image stored will effect how many images can be saved.  The internal 8mb of memory can capture around 55 Good (read e-mail quality photos), or 30 Better (real print quality photos), or 16 Best (read blow up poster sized quality photos).  Not really a lot of photos if your on vacation and like taking pictures.  Help is available however.  The DX3700 accommodates a MMC, (Multimedia Memory Card) that will expand the usable memory of your camera.  With a 64mb MMC (priced $57.00 on the Kodak website which by my research is one of the best prices around) you will be able to save 151 Better quality photos, PLUS the 30 that you can put on your internal memory.  That�s 181 photos before having to clear out your memory, not shabby at all.  MMC�s are available in 16MB($26), 32MB ($37) and 64MB ($57) sizes.  My recommendation is to get as much additional memory as you can reasonably afford, nothing is as bad as being unable to take more great photos because your out of memory.
The other major pieces of optional equipment available are the memory dock, rechargeable batteries, re-chargers and camera bags.  A few notes on each.  If you did not purchase the camera with a memory dock think twice before doing so.  The memory dock sounds fancy and complete and is, however it carries a hefty $79.00 price tag and what you�re getting is a nice place to set your camera while your not using it.  It is connected to your UBS cable as well as plugged in to a household socket.  So after your take your pictures you come home, and set your camera into the dock, your photos are automatically downloaded, and the battery begins to charge.  Simple yes, but consider this.  For $50.00 you can purchase a battery re-charger with Ni-MH battery ($35), as well as a second Ni-MH battery ($15).  When you return home plug in your camera download the photos, and swap the batteries in your charger, put your camera back it its bag.  You are now ready to go take more pictures and have $30 bucks in your pocket.  You also always have a fresh battery ready and the whole thing is portable if your going away, heck with the durability of these batteries you probably don�t need to bring the charger since you have a spare battery.  Either way you can�t really go wrong, and either way you will want to use a rechargeable battery instead of buying and throwing away the Lithium batteries that are sold to power the unit otherwise.  For the record they last a pretty long time, I used mine to take and review about 150 pictures.
A Camera bag is essential, and should cost about $15.00.  I do recommend checking out the Kodak site, I don�t generally hawk a retailer like this but they are very price competitive, the products sold are completely compatible with the camera and I have been very impressed with the service delivery time.  Enough said.
As a final note let me say that when I received the DX3700 I thought silently, bummer I wanted a more upscale model, however after owning and using this camera I am completely satisfied and content.  As noted it is easy to use, takes great pictures, and is feature rich and practically priced.  Overall Kodak has done a great job.  Go buy one, you won�t be disappointed.
