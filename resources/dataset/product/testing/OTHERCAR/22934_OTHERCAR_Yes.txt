            If you are looking for a car that offers you unsurpassed (even not by Cadillac) smoothness in ride, total silence (even the clock doesn't make a sound), huge load carrying capabilities (you'll never run out of space, no matter what), superb performance and iron cast reliability at an absolutely mediocre price, look no further.
I found a 78 Caprice with the 350/350 in 1988, when I opened my business for industrial maintenance service, requiring a car to travel 50,000 miles a year with 400 lbs of equipment on board. It had clocked already 150,000 miles at that point. The intention was to replace it after a year with something newer, as business progresses. Little did I know back then, that this car would be my friend for over five years.
I drove it everywhere in Europe, to Norway in winter, southern Spain in summer, over BAD roads in Eastern Europe (at least that is what other people told me, I never noticed in my Caprice) and I consistently chased big Bimmers and Benzes on German Autobahns, often outrunning them thanks to an ultra low 2,41:1 rear axle ratio. With Kumho all season whitewalls I once took off from standstill on an 18% slope in snow. Maybe the 400 pounds of tools in the trunk helped a little. In northern Norway the rear air shocks gave up and I drove the car home to Belgium with no problem at all. Only the nose pointed skywards. My apprentice, who was riding with me, couldn't believe that any car could sustain such abuse without any damage. He was hooked on the car from then on.
In 1994 I sold the car to him with over 400,000 miles on the clock. It still didn't need more than a quart of oil/ 5,000 miles and the heads were never off the engine. He still owns it and it is still going strong, with now 500,000 miles on it and the only trouble ever was, that the transmission had to be rebuilt in the meantime.

I replaced it with a 1993 Park Avenue and what a piece of junk that is compared to a Caprice, you can read in my opinion about that car.

My father has a 1989 Caprice Brougham that he bought when the car was two years old. It has travelled 90,000 miles by now and he wants to trade it in for a Seville. Maybe I should make him an offer for his Chevy he can't refuse...
