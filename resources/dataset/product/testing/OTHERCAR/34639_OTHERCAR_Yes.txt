            A minivan?  What happened to station wagons?  

Seeking a vehicle with engine enough to perform on the highway and hauling capacity for a boat as well as room and comfort for several passengers and a dog -- minivans were an obvious option as we searched the market in June 2000.  After looking at the major brands, we were left with the GM (Pontiac or Chevrolet) or Dodge Caravan.  The Dodge came up short in terms of price for options and extreme whistle from the rear side windows when closed.  

The Montana has several excellent features that we have come to appreciate.  The two sliding passenger doors have a smooth operation, although they can be tough to open -- a bit heavy -- when one is carrying something and not able to employ full body weight.  We opted for the manual doors.  The rear hatch is somewhat heavy to close and several times we have had to respond to the warnings of &quot;rear hatch ajar&quot; when my wife struggled to close the hatch properly.  The second major positive is the flexibility with seating and storage.  Although not the extended model, we have found the ease with which the rear seats may be folded forward or removed creates a great deal of carrying capacity.  Several other items, such as an excellent sound system, advanced door locks with delay for open doors, remote power rear vent windows, front and side air bags and child safety lockout on the sliding doors add to the positives. 

Generally the vehicle at about 6,000 miles is working extremely well.  Good performance on the highway -- although the V6 has to be given a bit of time to move the van to passing speeds.  Despite consumer guide warnings about cabin noise and side-panel issues, our vehicle remains whisper quiet and physically sound.  After a 1,500 mile round trip last weekend, we arrived at both the destination and home feeling very good -- not tired.  The space and comfort afforded by the seating is greatly appreciated.  Fuel economy on the trip was in the 28 to 30 miles/gallon (US) range with good highway driving conditions.  

The Montana is a minivan -- somewhat sportier than some competitors -- but still a minivan.  It is an excellent option for handling kids or small groups of adults whether in the city or on the highway.  Also a good option for those seeking some hauling options with flexibility for passengers, cargo or a place for a couple of people to sleep!  The V6 is a stable performer and handles a trailer -- but those seeking big power, acceleration and passing speeds should consider other options.
