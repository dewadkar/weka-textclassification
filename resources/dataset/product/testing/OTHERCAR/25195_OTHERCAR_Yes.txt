            Hi, 
I have to correct my previous statement about the design flaw in the heating system of 2000 Mazda Protege. My local Mazda dealer has just finally fixed the problem which was the poor assembly of the cable that controls the outside/inside air intake ( which was causing windows fogging and freezing). Why am I writing about it then if everything is OK now? 
Firstly, to let you know that I had to make 3 trips to this dealer to finally convince them that there was a problem ( they were just advising me to turn on AC open the windows etc.) Sounds familiar?
Secondly, to reflect on the state of things as far as assembly and quality control nowadays. Mazda Protege is acclaimed as being one of the few to have been granted the prestigious certificate of the highest quality craftsmanship ( and strictest quality control).
How come then that I found two trivial assembly faults in the first year of owning the car. 
First: the fuel tank cover would not open ( faulty cable). Thanks God I had some fuel in the tank and the dealer was nearby.
Second: the lever controlling the outside air intake was not working properly causing terrible fogging and freezing of windows( faulty cable again)
Conclusion: It looks like the quantity seems to be more important than quality these days despite the so called &quot;prestigiuos awards&quot;. Recently, I also bought a Panasonic VCR being hailed as &quot;Made in Japan&quot;. What can I expect?<br><br>
