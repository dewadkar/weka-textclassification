            I have had the privilege of driving a 1998 Mercury Sable for the last 2 years as a company car and recently hit the 50k mile mark.  I would say that the car has been very reliable for the most part.  However, I was a little worried when the car shut off in the middle of the road with 11 miles on the odometer on my ride home from the dealer the first day.   They suspected that it was a bad tank of gas, but later diagnosed the problem as a defective computer which was then replaced.

At about 12,000 miles the brakes began to vibrate and the problem was fixed by turning the front rotors.  Other than these items, the car has required little service outside of regular maintenance.

My sable has the standard 6 cylinder engine which even my conservative (mother of 2 children) wife comments on as lacking needed acceleration.  I would opt for the 24 valve engine if I was considering purchasing this car.  

I do feel that there are better cars in the price range however (see my review on the Nissan Maxima).  The interior is kind of &quot;funky&quot; with rounded dashboard features and a goofy stereo faceplate.  I understand that the dashboard has been toned down a bit on the 2000 models.

As you are probably aware, this car is almost identical to its sibling the Ford Tauras.  Most people and co-workers feel that the sable is slightly better looking with its tail lights &amp; rear window lines.  The upholstery is also somewhat upgraded.

Lots of room especially in the back seats and they seats also fold for extra cargo room with large items.

Overall, this is a decent car but not my first choice.<br><br>
