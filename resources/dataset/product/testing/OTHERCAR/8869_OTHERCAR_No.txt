            <b>A Bit of History</b>

This would be the THIRD Honda Accord purchased by my family. This is a 2000 Honda Accord EX for my sister.

We started back with a 1988 Honda Accord LX. Afterward, we purchased a 1991 Honda Accord LX.  No, it isn�t to replace the old Accord, more people in our family can drive. Only recently (2000) did we retire our old 1998 Honda Accord.

To put it simply, the Honda Accord is a reliable, affordable, fun to drive, and popular car. So why don�t I recommend it?

<b>Samo� Samo�</b>

The 2000 Accord didn�t have any particular feature which stands out from even its older 1991 relative. There is an extra air bag and a face lift, but most of the controls are the same. Now you get those airbag warning stickers on the sun visors. My sister went for the 4 cylinder engine version of the vehicle so it has only 150hp. She didn�t like leather so she has cloth seats. It felt the same as the 1991 Accord. Nothing special there either. Driving the car shows some enhancements (solid steering, more maneuverable), but nothing which strikes me as �WOW�.

<b>The Looks</b>

My sister likes the look of the car. She enjoys the alloy wheels and the sporty look. Personally, I don�t think it looks any more sportier then her old 1991 Honda Accord. She got it black and later tinted the windows (black). There is a sun roof on the car which functions pretty much standard.

<b>Status Quo</b>

Honda makes great products and this Accord is one of them. You among many others can own this vehicle too. A popular car basically benefits by having parts easy to find and to repair. More people will know more about the car. More people will also try to steal the car.

Overall though, my sister is happy with her 2001 Honda Accord EX. Will I recommend it to you? If you just want a good reliable car� go for it. However, I won�t recommend it if you want to be different.
