            Every car I have bought has been a Chevy. In 1998 I bought a 1990 Chevy Cavalier. Its roomy for a family of four. And easy to handle. My problem is that I never owned a car with so many things that go wrong in such a short time. Since I have owned this (6/98) I have had to replace the starter, brakes(shoes and pads), muffler, heating core and a belt. I have never had to spend so much money on a car before in such a short time. I also had  to  replace all 4 tires but I expect that with an older car. The worst part is I need it fixed again. I dont know whats wrong with it. So its sitting in my drive unable to be driven. And it wont be paid off till June. <br><br>
