            Take this for what it is worth, but shouldn't a 25K car come with anti-lock brakes?  I found this to be strange, as the rest of the car is technologically advanced.  The overall ride, look and feel of the Concorde is excellent, and I would be proud to own one.  But the lack of Anti-lock brakes is odd.  

We are looking at this car, and at the Intrigue, Legacy, and at the lower end the Alero.  All of these are Anti-lock brake equipped as a standard feature.  While the styling and cab-forward design are more striking, I would tend to lean toward one of the others that includes this safety feature.  

The Concorde has decent acceleration and handling, and while it looks like a sleek car on the outside, it has TONS of room on the inside.  My wife, who tends to like a bigger car, felt as if the Concorde was a little deceiving to drive, because it felt smaller than it is.  

I would recommend the car, but keep in mind while pricing it, that the addition of the Anti-lock brakes may add several hundred dollars to the overall cost.
