            I considered Camry/Accord/Others for replacing my 93 Maxima. Being budget conscious I looked at the Verona. Spacewise it was roomy almost as roomy as Maxima. leg room was excellent for the rear seats and v. good at front ( very tall guys will find it necessary to pull the front seat a little back). The fit and finish it very good. The S model offers all loaded features. The price was quite cheaper than Camry but offered better features. The 6 Cyl Inline engine surprised me with its smoothness.I got raves from my rear seat passengers. This is a really nice family sedan with an excellent warrantee. The car performs very well on the highway as well as hills where it found no problem with steep climbs. The acceleration is a tide slower than Accord but this car is not for impatient guys who want to roll over. Steering is responsive. A very good option if you want high segment options at a lower price. But be sure... this is no low quality Korean product..Suzuki has taken meticulous care for good quality inside and outside the car.Ofcourse your opinion will depend on how you feel when you test ride it.
