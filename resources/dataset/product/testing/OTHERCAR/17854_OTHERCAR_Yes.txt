            I purchased a new Blazer in july 2000. It was a manual transmission, 2 door, 4 wheel drive car. Even with 2 doors there is PLENTY of room for poeple to sit in teh back. Also, the back seats can fold forward so you can sleep on it for long trips. So far i didnt have to do any major maintainence. The main reason i purchased a SUv was beacuse i needed something to pull my boat. The Blazer does an excellent job pulling my 25 foot sea ray. The BLazer comes standard with a 4.3 liter V-6 engine (thats a huge v-6).   The one thing i didnt like about the Blazer is that it has really big headrest (especially the front seats) and the sometimes abstruct the drivers view. Other that that i have no complaints about the Blazer. <br><br>
