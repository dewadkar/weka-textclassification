               Yes, there are only two years left to buy the ultimate performance car under $70,000.  Way under; it only costs about $26,000.  This car is the 2000 Chevrolet Camaro SS.  Having owned 5 Camaros in the past, and done years of research on my favorite car, I can honestly say if you are a fan of muscle cars, sports cars, or even economy cars (my SS is rated at 28mpg highway), this is the ONLY choice out there.  
    Lets get the criticisms out of the way.  The windshield- Terrible design, based on the Pontiac &quot;Banshee&quot; showcar from a decade ago.  There are negligible aerodynamic benefits to this.  The dash board is a mile long, and the engine sits half-way under it.  Not a mechanic-friendly car.  Chevy should have made it much less angled.  This would dramatically improve the aesthetics of the car.  Interior room- who cares?  There is ample room for two, and with the fold-down read seats, there is a TON of storage space.  If you buy this for your family car, you shouldn't be reading this anyway.  That's it for the bad points...
    When you get into this car, you are in another world.  The enormous hood scoop is the only thing you see out the windshield.  It feels like a jet-fighter, not a car.  The car starts with a turbo-like whine from the starter.  The idle is subdued, but present.  A Hurst 6-speed shifter is the logical choice for an SS, and mine is Ferrari-like in its short throws.  With a 3.42 ratio (with the 6-speed), launches are easy, but with 330hp on tap with the SLP exhaust, it can get smokey in the rear easily.  The 17 inch wheels and massive tires maintain excellent grip.  I ordered mine with T-tops, Hurst 6-speed, performance lubricants, and SLP exhaust.  This is all you need for this kind of car.  Keep the weight down and keep you time-slips down.
    On the road, you realize this car is for one thing.  Going VERY fast.  0-60 in about 4.8 seconds, 1/4 miles in mid-13's-from the factory.  Forget racing Mustangs, those punks won't even race me with their 260hp GT's or 285hp Saleens.  The Cobras are close, but slightly slower and more expensive.  I've had guys with sooped-up Hondas (you know the type) try to race me.  The SS will win immediately, as the exhaust slowly growls up to a loud roar.  By the time I had a chance to look in the rear-view mirror, the Honda had already made a U-turn from embarrassment.  It's to the point now that no one will even race me.  Not only will the SS Camaro beat 99% of the cars out there,even many Porshes, Ferraris, etc. but you win by default.  This car is intimidating. 
     To drive a ubiquitous Mustang is like being a Metallica fan at an N-SYNC concert.  You are just underwhelmed.  My roomate has a '95 Mustang.  It has already had it's engine replaced at 60,000 miles.  It is extremely small, handles like a wet mattress, and looks like an older Toyota Celica.
I don't understand why anyone would by a Mustang.  I went looking at Saleens the other day.  An S-281 was there with 285hp and a $37,000 price tag.  It was a joke.  I asked where the real Saleens were.  This was the supercharged S-351.  It had about 360hp.  Not bad...for $52,000.  It would beat my SS barely, but at twice the price.
  Bottom line, if you are a half-hearted person, buy a Mustang GT and fit in with the N-SYNC crowd.  You can have fun going 0-60 in under 7 seconds.  
If you are a true performance fan, you wouldn't be caught dead in anything less than a 330hp monster for $26,000.  This car has muscle-car aggressive looks, grand-prix car like handling, 158mph top speed, amazing acceleration, lots of room (this is relative), excellent fuel economy 21/28, and it's as much fun as an F-15 jet fighter.  Buy it, and you will be the only guy on the street that matters.
