            In the full-size truck world, the domestics dominate the market.  But now, growing in popularity and proving its mettle: enter the Toyota Tundra.  Built in Indiana, powered and equipped like its domestic competition, Toyota's big truck is giving the Big Three a run for their money.

I owned a 1999 Nissan Frontier (compact pick-up) for a year and a half and got great service from it, but it was very small and only had a four-cylinder engine.  I decided to upgrade to a full-size truck with a V8.

I was lucky enough that through my job I was able to drive Ford F-150s, Dodge Rams, and Chevy C-1500s (all V8 equipped) on a regular basis.  While I enjoyed using them at work, there were too many shortcomings on quality in the "Big Three."  I am not fond of squeaks, rattles, and other annoyances, and they were common.  The Chevys had reliable engines, but several of our Fords and Dodges had to go into the shop for engine work.  Even though warranties covered the repairs (we were buying brand new trucks), it was a hassle to be without a truck and have down-time.

When I started reading reviews on Toyota's Tundra, I knew it might be the best option for me.  Compared to the big three, feature to feature, it measured up.  The most important key was TOYOTA QUALITY.  I knew I would get better reliability, fit and finish, and resale value, just like Toyota's cars and SUVs.

The things that sold me on the Toyota Tundra:

- The V8 engine is VERY powerful and fast (245 hp)
- The automatic transmission shifts like a dream
- The fit and finish is impeccable...totally solid
- The ride is smooth and fluid (like a Lexus)
- Visibility is great all around
- The four-door cab is a benefit (on any truck)
- (Again) peace of mind in owning a quality Toyota product

The shortcomings:

- Some domestics have larger four-door cabs
- The back seat is a bit small for full-size adults

Regarding price, if you decide to buy a Tundra, be sure to take advantage of the pricing guides on the web.  By using my credit union and web resources such as Kelly's Blue Book www.kbb.com, Edmunds www.edmunds.com, and the NADA www.nadaguides.com.  I was able to knock $2400 off of the sticker price and buy my Tundra for only $100 over the dealer invoice WITHOUT all the usual car dealer song-and-dance.  They realized that I had my facts straight, so it was an easy experience.

I could go into all sorts of details about statistics comparing the Tundra to the domestics; and each has its own advantages.  If you are going to spend twenty to thirty thousand dollars on a full-size truck, you should consider (and test drive) all options in the market.  Drive 'em all, climb in and out of the cabs, consider towing capacity and whether or not you NEED four wheel drive, and keep reading advice and experience from owners.  Even if you don't buy a Tundra, I believe you will be impressed by it.  Best of luck in your shopping.
