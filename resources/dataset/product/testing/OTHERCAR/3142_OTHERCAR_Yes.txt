            What do you do when a credit card company foolishly sends you a check good for $10,000?  I called them to be sure, then.. since our trusty old Audi was falling apart... we headed for the local VW dealership.  Just to look around!
   
We were about to leave when a sales person (Bob) said, "What kind of car are you looking for?"  "Something under $10,000", we answered.  He said, "Got your Baby, come with me!" and we followed him across the lot, thru the show room and out to the other lot.  There sat a pretty, "sandstone" (silvery to me) colored, shiny new car.  Well, I found out it is a year old.  But new to me.  Bob gave us the keys and said, "Give her a workout." So we drove out to the nearby freeway and did just that.
   
Roomy enough for my 6'4", 250 lb spouse, we were cruising in splendor.  The interior looked like new, and this little jewel offered a most comfortable ride.
   
This car has "over-drive" as an option, and cruising in O/D cuts on gas consumption.  We've been getting 29-31 mpg for the past two months we've had this car.  We put it on 68 mph, set the cruise control and sit back and enjoy.  The air-conditioner does reduce mpg, so we just open the back windows a bit and (along with the auto air circulation) there's a nice breeze and "air" isn't necessary.  We've found that this little car has plenty of power, when necessary and is easy to maneuver.
 
The front seat lays back almost flat, I found out when I got a cramp and had to "straighten out" for a minute. (old age, you know)  It is also most convenient to know the back seat will lay flat and allow something really long to protrude from the trunk into the interior of the back seat area.  There's plenty of room in the trunk. There's also air circulation which keeps it from becoming an "oven" on these hot days when the groceries are in danger of "cooking" on the way home.

So far, the fantastic warranty was necessary for a couple minor items.  The service we got from the North Olmsted Hyundai dealer was prompt, courteous and efficient.  

We already have AAA for our truck, which is sort of "double coverage" on the car, since the warranty is 24-hour roadside assistance for the next 4 years. and also 4 year bumper to bumper warranty. 

So far, we are most pleased with our new mode of transportation.  And I never realized the seat belt is adjustable at the top.  Just press the side "button" and it can be raised or lowered to fit the passenger.

Our radio works great, once I figured out the "tricks" to it.  We do plan to replace the dinky, foreign tires with new tires before we leave for Texas.
