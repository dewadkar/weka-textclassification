            I bought this car used from a very reputable dealer in my area (West Chester, PA). The car had one owner and had been very well maintained. Had 27,000 miles at purchase in June, 1998. This is my second BMW. The first was an older (1980s) 318i. The 328i is FAR superior in handling, interior comforts, construction, etc. I love this car. I have had NO problems at all. I change the oil every 4,000 miles and have the manufacturer's service done every 10,000 miles. The car has excellent acceleration and great brakes. I am very happy that I got the bigger engine. It makes a big difference in acceleration. I highly recommend the 3 series BMW. When this car gets close to 100,000 miles I'll get another one.

BMW's used car program is a good one. I felt very comfortable buying this car used. It has served me well.<br><br>
