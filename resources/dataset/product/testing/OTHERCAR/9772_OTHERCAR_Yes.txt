            When my dad first purchased the Isuzu Rodeo in 1998, I was overwhelmed at the raw engine. The 2.2 liter inline four, cast iron aluminum alloy engine and a peak horsepower of about 130hp@5200 rpm, I was just literally &quot;swept&quot; the first time my dad took the new shining green Rodeo out for the stroll around the block (I heard the engine roaring). This SUV greatly resembles Honda's Passport SUV, which is also a great SUV. But it is at a cost of about 3,000 dollars extra. The Rodeo has very great handling/steering, great transmission, 4-wheel system drive, and excellent front/rear suspension-making this car a formidable choice for many SUV lovers. The seats are comfortable (even the back seat), and there is a lot of trunk space to pack gear suited for long trip outings. My dad owns the car for about 2 years now, and he hasn't had many real problems with it. The only cons against the Rodeo is the fuel economy, for it doesn't get many miles on a gallon. But other than that, I'd say this car is a bet for the money.<br><br>
