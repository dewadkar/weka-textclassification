            If you are not in the market for a small car than stay away from this car.  If all you need is a cute little car than there really isn't a reason not to buy this car.  

My boyfriend owns this car ans we drive it everywhere.  My car stays parked in the driveway.  We take it everywhere because it is so good on gas.  It also has amazing storage space.  I have never seen so much.  5 cup holders, 2 glove boxes, it even has storage under the steering wheel (which you would think would be in the way but trust me it is not).  There is a change holder next to the steeering wheel.  ( It doesn't hold alot but you can fit a couple of bucks in there) 

The back seats fold down in a 60/40 manner to give you. easy access to the huge trunk.  I do find it easier to put big things in the trunk throught the back seat; as the trunk oppenning is quite narrow but the truck is very large.  Great for luggage and toys for those long trips

The placement of the gauges is out if this world.  When I first got into this car I thought what a dumb place to put them  but after driving the car it is hard to go back to looking through the sterring wheel to tell how fast you are going.  

The seats are pretty comfy even for long rides but there is not much leg room if someone is sitting in the back.  (small children only).  It is good for long trips, between the storage space, the gas, and being so comfy (again small children only in the back)

The stereo is average nothing more that what you need.  In a pinch this car will really get you were you need to go in a hurry but remember once you get above 120kms the gas gauge starts to fall pretty quick.  Average speed the gas is great. 

The only problem I have with this car is the handling which I am sure is fine once you get used to the car but for the first couple of times you fell like the car is steering itself.  When my boyfriend drives it is fine so it must take some getting used to
