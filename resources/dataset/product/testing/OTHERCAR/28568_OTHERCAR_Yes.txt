            I love my 2000 solar yellow Jeep Wrangler.  I bought it as a fun third car.  It has the looks and the image that I want. It is the classic small SUV.  It screams &quot;look at me.&quot;  My two other cars are a Mustang convertible and a Chevy Suburban.  My wife has a Dodge Durango.  Yes, we love SUV's and American cars.  

I have a soft top with the 4.0 liter engine and the 5-speed.  A great combo.  The jeep is perky and a blast to drive.  My wife and I now fight over it.  I recommend the Dana 44 rear end.  I have 30 inch tires and factory alloy wheels. They look O.K., but I would prefer 31X10.5's and American Racing Shadow wheels.  

The transmission is smooth.  I like the easy clutch.  The torque peak is at 2800, which makes for easy in town driving.  The engine gets a little buzzy above 4000 rpms.  

The soft top is surprisingly tight.  The lack of snaps is a plus.  The folding top is easy to use.  The front windows drop in quickly. The back quarter windows and rear window zip and Velcro in with only a little work.  Once in, there is no air leak. On the highway there is a little flapping of the side panels.  This is eliminated if the vent is turned on, I guess forcing air into the cabin.  Unzip a window on the highway, however, and unleash a cacophony of sound and turbulence.  Better to use the AC.

 With the windows off and the top up, it is not too bad.  I think it's best with the folding top down.  The top folds well in the rear and is easy to put up and down.  You could carry the other panels in the Jeep in case of rain, but they are bulky and easy to steal.  

I do not have to drive the Jeep if rain is in the forecast.  The Jeep as a second car is a plus.  

I quickly abandoned the factory sound system opting for an Alpine head unit, two MTX amps, 12 inch sub, Infinity 4x6 fronts and component 6 and 1/2 inch Polks on the sound bar. Below 55 mph, it sounds awesome.  Above 60, I turn it off.  

The quality, fit, and finish are excellent. No complaints. 

The Jeep Wrangler &quot;is what it is.&quot;  Open, airy, fun to drive.  If you want a practical daily driver, a hard top Jeep or another vehicle may be the ticket.  

However, if you want to turn your commute into fun, and want to have a perpetual smile on your face, I can definitely recommend the Wrangler.  Good tunes definitely help. The Jeep is a sure cure for road rage.
