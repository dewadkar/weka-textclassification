            A few months back, my girlfriend and I decided to go look for a car to replace her old Corolla.  She decided to wait until this new 2003 Accord came out to compare it to the Camry.  This was convenient because we were moving from CT to Indiana at the time, and could not budget time for car shopping.

Anyway, we go to the dealership in Evansville, about an hour or so from where I live in Vincennes, because it's the closest to me.  We get there on a luckily slow business day.  We looked at a tan (boooooooooring) Accord LX automatic, the only car the dealer had up for test driving.  Apparently there was a waiting list, and every Accord on the lot was sold except for the tan one.  One good thing about this dealership, the salesman stayed behind and let us drive the car on our own.

This was the fun part.  With no salesman with us, we could test the car to it's limits!  So we headed for I-64 and tested out it's capabilities.  The car had very little power for merging, even when floored.  We were lucky that traffic was light!  I believe this has to do with the typical lack of torque associated with Honda engines, and having to rev the guts out of them for power.  After the highway we tested out how it would do in city traffic, and again the lack of torque was apparent.  The throttle had to go at least 50% of it's travel to keep up with traffic.  I found this car's behavior to be odd.

Now onto styling.  I personally think the new Accord is not very attractive, but it was to be my girlfriend's car, so it was really up to her.  We had stopped at a grocery store parking lot to give this car a look over, and she didn't think to much of the exterior either in person (she liked it before from magazines).  The rear end looks saggy and frumpy, and the placement of the Honda symbol in the grille make the car look buck toothed.  We both agreed that the interior was the car's best part.  The large instruments, to the stereo, to the HVAC console are very nicely laid out.  The seats were nicely upholstered and comfortable.  The only downside was the drab tan interior.

I would still recommend this car.  Maybe it looks better in other colors or trim levels.  Maybe the one I test drove had something wrong with it to have it lack power as it did, but the dealer had no others to compare it to.  Even here in Indiana, which is very flat, 4-cylinder engines don't do to badly, which is why I found the Accord's lack of power odd.  I really was expecting better.

BTW, my girlfriend bought a 2003.5 Toyota Camry LE V6 (the new one with the VVT-I V6).
