            Bad things first:
1. Reliability problem:  my new Jeep's interior light cover fell off; there were some unrecognizable plastic parts rolling around; the washer warning light turned on sporadically, the windows didn't close tight, and the AC stopped working at 37,000 miles (that is 1,000 miles after the warranty expired). 
2. It's flimsy: my Jeep went through two accidents - a fender-bender at under 10 mph caused $2,500 damage, and a rear-ender while the Jeep was parked caused - believe it or not - $12,500 damage. A Jeep, in uni-body, is not as sturdy as its look suggests.

Good things Second:
It's fun to drive, no doubt about it. In a vehicle like this you feel you're the coolest guy on the road. The wind noise, the somewhat uncertain handling and the rough transmission all adds to the rough guy feeling.

Go test drive one - the characteristics of the Jeep are so distinct you either fall in love with it immediately or will swear you don't want to touch one again.
