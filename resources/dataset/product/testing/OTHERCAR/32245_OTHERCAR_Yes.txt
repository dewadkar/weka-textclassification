            This is absolutely the best 2-door coupe I have ever owned. The 2003 CLK500 has outstanding saftey features from assisted braking systems, airbags all-around, and traction & stability control for the responsible adult.  Plus, for the Devil in all of us, it features a powerful V8 engine, with incredible suspension, and the ability to turn on a dime.  
     I'm a very tall man, I stand about 6'4".  With the seat all the way back, I fit nicely into the CLK500.  Unfortunately, I don't leave much room for the passenger behind me.  The backseat is rather cramped for those who are tall people. 
     The instrument panel looks very stylish at night, with soft blues, and just the right amount of ambient lighting. Makes the interior looks very sleek and futuristic, the display is subtly illuminated at night, without being distractingly bright. 
     One of my favorite features of my CLK is the transparent B-Pillars, it nearly eliminates your most common blind spot.  Making things not only safe for the driver, but safer for those outside the car.  
     My only true gripe is that the CLK500 is rear wheel drive, so, living in snowy New England, isn't a great mix.  Being rear-wheel drive, the car has a tendency to "fish-tail" in snowy conditions. Traction control does help, but only to a certain extent.  However, this can be a drivers dream for those of us big kids that like to play, with stability control, and a powerful engine.  Empty snow-covered parking lots become our new playground. 
     If you live in a snowy climate, I would suggest an alternate winter vehicle.
