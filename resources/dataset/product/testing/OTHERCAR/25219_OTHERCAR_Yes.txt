            Corolla has been a staple in Toyota's sedan market for decades.  Not many cars have been around this long, so Toyota must be doing something right.

My experience with the 2004 Corolla comes from a 1 day rental for a business trip that required around 300 miles of driving.

EXTERIOR:

The exterior of my 2004 Corolla LE was tasteful and modern.  Most people buy their Corollas for reliability and value, consequently Toyota styles this car very conservatively.  Not many people will call this car an "ugly" car, but then again, not many people will say its "beautiful" either.  The S Model has some options to make your Corolla look sportier, such as a spoiler, alloy rims, fog lights, and side moldings.  But even then, the Corolla is definitely a car you want to drive if you don't want to be noticed.

INTERIOR:

The interior of my Corolla LE was finished in charcoal cloth with a little bit of faux wood trim.  Overall the interior is comfortable and functional and styled tastefully.  I personally didn't care for the dashboard layout.  The dashboard is very square and symmetrical, with rectangular vents and gauge pod.  In my opinion, the styling of the dashboard would be better employed in a compact SUV, like the RAV-4.  The radio is high on the dashboard, and I was forced to lean forward a little to change channels or change CDs.  The A/C controls are central and very user friendly.  The gauges were white-faced and very readable.  I thought the steering wheel was exceptionally cool, it has a very sporty look and doesn't even look like it has an airbag (which it does!)  The car has more storage compartments than any other car I've seen!  There were 2 in the dash below the A/C controls, 1 to the left of the steering wheel, 2 separate compartments in the center armrest, the glove box, and a map holder on each door.  The seats were comfortable for short drives and long trips, and with a tall roofline, there is plenty of room for taller occupants.  Rear seats have headrests, a nice safety feature for adult passengers.

The trunk on the Corolla isn't very large, but it is appropriately sized for a car this big.  The opening is kind of small, the rear window is raked rearwards so far that it limits the trunk opening.  The rear seats will fold down for more storage, though.

One of my biggest complaints was visibility.  The front pillar seems excessively wide and blocked my vision when turning left.  The door pillars are also wide and make for a larger blind spot.  The rear window seemed small, and the rear headrests blocked some of my vision on the corners of the window.  

PERFORMANCE:

The Corolla is an economy car, and performs like a good economy car should.  Power comes from an inline 4 cylinder.  My rental had an automatic transmission with 3 speeds and an overdrive.  When the car needs power for passing or merging, the transmission usually has to drop into a lower gear to take advantage of the engines power in the upper RPM ranges.  At higher RPM, the engine gets a little noisy, but at lower RPM it is plenty quiet.  My Corolla got about 32 MPG on the highway.

Handling is decent with good feel and good response.  Ride is comfortable without being soft.  Overall the car felt very solid.

FEATURES:

While not high on creature comforts, the Corolla LE I drove did have a few nice features.  The gauge pod has an outside temperature gauge, as well as 2 trip logs instead of 1.  The passenger seat has a sensor to tell if there is another occupant, and lights a seatbelt light on their side of the dash if they do not buckle up.  The sensor may or may not activate the passenger airbag, if you are curious I would ask your Toyota dealership.  My Corolla LE came with an AM/FM/CD Player.  The sound system sounded excellent, especially for a stock system.

FINAL VERDICT:

The Corolla is definitely a good car and a great value for the money.  It does everything an economy car is supposed to.  However, it is neither an exciting nor inspiring car.  If you consider your car just a tool to get you from one place to the other, this is definitely a great car and I highly recommend it.  If, on the other hand, you want your car to have personality, performance, or make your neighbors jealous, this might not be the car for you.
