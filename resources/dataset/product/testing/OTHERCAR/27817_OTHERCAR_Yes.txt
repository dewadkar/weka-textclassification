            This is a great line, by Canon.  However, if you can afford the S110 or S200 cameras, then I would definitely recommend going in that direction.  The size CANNOT be beat, though.  At only 2.1 mega pixels, it is pretty good.  Turn off the LCD in order to (significantly) extend the battery life.
This model does not have some of the software improvements that the newer models do.  It is limited to shooting at 100 ISO, and there is a fairly long 'delay' in between shots, if you are attempting to shoot sports or other types of rapid action.
This little camera is small enough to fit into your pocket and carry around with you.  While it can't (and should not) replace your regular SLR camera, it is very convenient.  (I find that I don't take my SLR with me, unless shooting something 'more professional', so this camera is great.)
