            Nobody talks about chrome anymore!  I own a '98 Continental, and I love its looks more than any other car on the road, except maybe the Jaguars.
It proves that chrome still adds a luxury look to a car.  There probably isn't a car being made with as much chrome!  By comparison, the new Cadillacs are very ugly!

I like the ride, but my main complaint are the seats.  There is very poor back support.  The lumbar adjustment helps the lower back, but there is virtually no cushioning to support the middle back.  You also sit with your behind down and your knees up.  If you straighten out the electric seats, you are sitting too high, since only the back part goes up.  At least that's the way it is for a 6'2 man like myself.

The car runs well on regular gas, which is a plus with today's gas prices.
I notice only a small difference in gas mileage, and virtually none in performance.  The car manual recommends premium, but indicates that all grades are acceptable.

Another gripe: the dash.  The gauges and lights are very crowded without organization.  The wording on the right which tells various information is nice.  Too bad there is no option to see the MPH (or K/PH) in digits!

The stereo sounds wonderful.  I have the 6 CD changer.  The cassette is the best sounding one I have ever heard in a car.

Looks = 100%.  I have the soft top added by the dealer which enhances looks even more.

Ride = 80%.

Comfort = 50%<br><br>
