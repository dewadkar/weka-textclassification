            I was looking to finance my first car last June.  I went to Curry Chevrolet and found a great deal.  A used 98 four door Cavalier.  The mileage was rather good, only 28,000.  This car has a number of pluses.  It drives well in the snow.  It has a kick to the drive.  Miles per gallon are high, and it warms up fairly quickly.  I've had this car for about 7 months now, and I've never been happier.  It's always a question when you go to buy a car &quot;can I see myself driving this for x number of years?&quot;  I can certainly drive this car for quite a while.  Who knows, my next car might be a Chevy as well!<br><br>
