            First off, I did not buy this product.  It was a gift from my company for my twenty years of service!  I won't comment who got the better end of that deal.  It was my first digital though so I was anxious to try it out.

I was a bit disappointed that my first pictures came out blurred in spots.  My first thought (briefly) was that I wasn't holding the camera still.  My next set with the camera resting on solid steel was also blurry in spots.    I even started testing it against patterns so that I could see where it was off.  

I wrote to Vivitar and told them about the problem.  No response.  I was stuck at that point.  It is really a shame as I was expecting much more from Vivitar.  I have bought many of their products over the years.  I guess they have decided to make money the easy way and have let everyone in customer service go.

I have made the best of it.  I don't use the LCD at all and got about 100 pictures out of it (at the highest quality of course).  I did find that if I use the LCD it runs out of batteries quickly.  

Don't get me wrong, I have kept lots of my pictures and post them on the internet.  The software all worked fine and I found that the panorama shots (taking 2 or more shots in a row and using the software to merge the pictures.  Using this feature was really pretty good.

Overall, if you are given this camera, I would not throw it away.  But I sure wouldn't have paid for it to begin with!
