                I have been lusting after Camaros ever since I can remember. They're good looking, they're powerful, they've got heritage (so what if it's a few years' less than the Mustang's??), they're damn quick, and above all, I'd have to say they're the BIGGEST performance bargain (alongside the Trans Am) in the known world. Come on, 320 ponies for oh, let's say, $30,000?? An even bigger bargain is the Z28 with 305 horses going for around $28,000. Name another car company that has a car with that kind of horsepower for under 30 grand. Nope, no Bimmers or Benzes or Porsches found here. Even the Mustang who's in the price range of the Camaro is behind in the performance times that the Camaro can set. 
   Anyways, back to my review, I finally got a chance to drive the baddest of the ponycars, the 2000 Z28 SS. Oh, it was gorgeous (well, if you're accustomed to the new update given in '98) beautiful black on the outside, and smooth ebony leather inside. It had T-tops (of course) and the 6-speed. Starting it up, it had this wonderful rumble, as it should. The car was very behaved in town, only stepping out under your direction. The 6-speed was a bit confusing though, a few times, I ended up downshifting when I was aiming to upshift; the gates didn't feel very well defined. I'd still choose the manual though, it's not the same with an automatic in this kind of car.
   It rode very nicely, considering you're like 3 inches off the ground, and it's wearing 17-inch performance rubber. Joints in the road were merely quietly commented on by the tires and suspension, and not shouted over. But you're still very connected, very in touch with the car, which I love. It also had relatively no outside noise that I heard (besides engine and tires), and on the highway, handled itself well. 80mph felt precariously close to 60. Watch yourself in this one.
   The seats despite being low, were power, and you could adjust it any way you wanted for comfort, and I had no problems seeing over the dash (which, by the way, there is ALOT of, caused by the REALLY steeply raked windshield) and hood (which you can't see the end of, but after a few miles, it's easily adjusted for). They were so comfortable and supportive, I felt like the seats were actually holding me, and I wasn't just sitting on them. The steering wheel, despite being a bit ugly, did the job well, and I love its bolstered grip on the 3 and 10 o'clock position on the wheel, but was overall nice and beefy. The manual stick itself was easy to grip, and was placed well, with the throws not too long, or too short.
   I didn't really listen to the radio during my drive (even though it had the 500-watt Monsoon stereo system) but I did hear it when we were stopped at a stoplight. The volume was turned down, but even then, it filled the cabin with clear, pure sound.
   I want to comment on the superb 4-wheels disc brakes. On my drive, the Jimmy in front of me suddenly stopped, and even though it got a bit close, it hauled me down quickly, safely, and surely with no fade, and no fuss.
   The car is an attention getter. At stoplights I caught quite a few people giving it a lookdown, and one guy even gave me an appreciative smile after doing so. 
   If you want one and can afford it, go for it. Get 'em while they're still available, and relatively afordable, and if you choose to think of them so, they'll no doubt some day be a great collector's item.<br><br>
