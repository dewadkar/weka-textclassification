             Pitiful pitiful pitiful.....I purchased this for the reason allot of you did value for the buck, unfortunately with this you don't get much value.
Firstly, auto flash isn't auto due to light it just flashes all the time, which means glare on most close-ups. It does however fail to flash which is just a waste of memory in darker surroundings, but gives a better picture in lighted circumstances. Also the viewfinder and the photo don't jive, on close up shots it's 2 inches off from left to right. 

I don't like anything about the camera or the software, the price angle is moot since all you can take is distance shots. The software is slow and unimaginative and freezes up if you try and download a full memory chips worth of photos. I usually have to do 3 at a time and When it freezes, it freezes the whole computer forcing a cold boot. Battery life is non existant even with auto shut off which is the only thing it does right.

My advice is stear away from this if your a serious photographer and even if your a novice, it will disapoint.<br><br>
