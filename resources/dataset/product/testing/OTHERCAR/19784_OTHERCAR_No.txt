            My husband and I use to own a VW Golf, a 1996 model, that was till Dec of 99, when we traded it in.When we traded our golf in it had some 54,000 plus miles on it.The engine was holding up nicely but inside was falling apart and so was some of the outside features and even had some broken parts that broke non-stop since the car left its warranty period.

This is a list of just a few things that fell apart:


~The side molding fell off( Not once but MANY MANY times)
~The dash board lights went out not once but 3 times
~The Key hole on the outside of the door feel out
~The daytime running lights went out
~The Truck button stopped working
~The leather around the Stick Shift wore away and had to be replaced 3 times
~Check Engine Light kept coming on, when there was nothing wrong and got that fixed but only for it to turn around and be back on again within weeks following getting it fixed
~The airbags become no good, had to get that fixed

And that may not seem like alot to most people, but alot of this happen for the first time in the first 12 months we owned the car.And to go along with this the seats were'nt comfy for long drives, after an hr my back would be killing. And for some odd reason if you hit 75 or higher in the car the whole care would start shaking..go figure.

Finally my husband and I had enough and traded it in for a 2000 Montero Sport, which has been a great car so far, ask me in a year, that is when all the problems will start if there is any.

VW makes a good car, but only for the engine, the rest is a piece of crap, they use cheap stuff to build their car, which does'nt last long...Not worth the 18,900 we paid for the car....
