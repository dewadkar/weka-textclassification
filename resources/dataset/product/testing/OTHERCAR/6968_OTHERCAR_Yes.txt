            My wife was constantly saying she wanted a Ford Explorer.  We test drove some and they seemed very boxy and rough.  We tried the Chevy Blazer and loved it.  It sat and drove like a car but had the features for an SUV. It is a very smooth quiet ride. The push button 4WD is great (no lugs to set) during the winter months in Idaho.  The rear seat folds down in five seconds to give you plenty of storage space. We bought the Blazer used (three months) and we've had the vehicle for almost 1.5 years and have had no maintenance or performance issues.  There is plenty of leg room in the back seat even when I have the front seats all the way back.<br><br>
