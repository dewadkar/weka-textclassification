            I just received this camera as a gift and am having the best time using it. I am by no means a camera expert, but I do love to take pictures. This camera is easy to use as is the software that comes with it. It takes great pictures and you can choose the quality you need for the project you are doing-email needs lower quality, thus your memory card will hold more of those type of pictures. The high quality pictures are great for printing and I am using them in my scrapbooks. I really like the fact that I can view a picture and decide whether I want to keep it or not. No more duds when I pick up my film from the lab. I just print the ones I like and either delete or save and catalog the rest. 

The only negative I have found is that it goes through batteries like crazy, but it comes with 2 sets of batteries AND 4 rechargeable batteries with the charger. A very big plus for me and my family. 

So far I have emailed pictures, posted on eBay and printed out my kid's Christmas morning shots. I am very satisfied with this camera.<br><br>
