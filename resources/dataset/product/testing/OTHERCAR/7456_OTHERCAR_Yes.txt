            When I first got divorced I had a Mazda pickup truck that was wonderful...but I felt it was left to me in the divorce and not what I would have chosen to have bought for myself.  So, when the time came to buy a new vehicle, I wanted to purchase my very first vehicle all by myself, with no help from the male gender (I've gotten over that now thank goodness!) and it was so very important to me to make a good decision and purchase a reliable yet sporty car.  After much research it seemed the Pontiac Grand Am was the best buy.  I had owned a Pontiac before that was a good car...so I was off, to purchase my first car as a single woman, and extremly confident that I had chosen the right car.

It was beautiful, maroon with a gray interior..stick shift...and that wonderful smell that a new car carries.  I even purchased the extended warranty.  I was so proud of myself. But it didn't take long for reality to set in.  I had the car less than a week when it overheated.  I stopped at the first gas station and they said they thought the thermostat was sticking..but since its under warranty to take it back to the dealer.  Two days and 25.00 deductible later I had my new car back.  About 2 days after that it overheated again.  Once more, I'm at the shop.  It leaked oil, which I found later to be the major problem...a cracked head.  Again, I'm without a vehicle and paying the dealer 25.00 deductible each time.   Finally, 37 invoices later....I parked the vehicle at the dealership and told them to do what they had to.  It seemed ridiculous to me to pay more out a month in deductibles than my car payment was.

I now own a Saturn which I'm extremely happy with.  And to this day I wonder if that car was built on a Monday when they were all recouping from a wild weekend...or a Friday, when they are anxious to get to the weekend.<br><br>
