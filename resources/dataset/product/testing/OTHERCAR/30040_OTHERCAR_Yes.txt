            This camera if for people who want simple operation, good quality pics, and no bells and whistles. 

At about $500 street it's at the top of the mid range and bottom of the high range. A sort of intermediate cam. Vastly better picture quality than most lower or even similarly priced cams. But the trade off is the price goes totally into the quality of the pics. Features like real zoom, macro, remote flash triggering are all missing. If these capabilities aren't important to you, you'll probably love it. If they are you probably won't. 

Provides excellent point and shoot pics at the 17xx by 11xx level. And it takes about 1 minute to learn to use it. For users with USB capability the extra $30 power supply is truly optional as the USB uploads very quickly. The high quality pics are fine for printing at a 5x7 or smaller size with excellent quality. If you want to produce 8x10's the quality is not as good but adequate for most uses. Produces a JPG output with few artifacts in the image. So the cam makes very good use of the memory. 

Features like real zoom, macro, remote flash triggering are all missing. The &quot;2x&quot; zoom ranges from 28mm to 6omm equivelant. So it's great for wide angle shots. But calling it a zoom is a stretch. The full zoom brings you to an almost normal focal length. I have not yet tried the optional 2x teleconverter or macro lenses so don't know their effectiveness. There seem to be less compatability with aftermarket options (lenses etc)than with slightly more expensive camera's. It is not fast..You can take 2-3 pictures quickly...but then must wait while they are written to the flash card. The 'shutter(?)' is very slow. Attempts to capture soccer action meant guessing when the action will be and clicking 1 to 1-1/2 seconds early and hoping for the best. 

Good Midrange Camera! <br><br>
