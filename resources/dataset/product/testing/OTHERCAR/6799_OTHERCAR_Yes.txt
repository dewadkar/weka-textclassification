            After nearly three months of research on digital cameras I had decided to go with the FinePix 3800, then Fuji updated this model with the S3000. Being new to digital, I can not compare photo results with those of other cameras, but I tried numerous digital cameras in stores, & this one topped the list.
The feel of it in my hand was the first hint: an SLR feel, something to grip, unlike slender models I didn't feel I had control over. With the touch of a button I switched between the viewfinder & the LCD monitor. The monitor gives a clear picture.
Other cameras in this price range that I found with 3 to 3.9 megapixels did not sport such a hefty zoom. The 6X optical zoom is superior.
The most outstanding component of this camera is the ease of use. While I stood at the camera counter with other brands, I had to be directed step by step by the sales person. With the Fujifilm FinePix S3000 in hand, I easily breezed through the on-screen instructions to take, play back, navigate & erase photos & videos.
When I got the camera home, I read through the well-written instruction manual to learn about & try using the Auto Focus frame, the Framing Guideline, Multi-frame Playback, Playback Zoom, Self-timer Photography, protecting images so they can not be accidently erased, & playing back photos & videos on my television screen (the grandparents loved this one). Especially useful are the automatic warnings (the shot is not focused, strong likelihood of camera shake) before you take the shot, & instructions on how to remedy the situations. I have yet to try any manual settings, & might never get to that point, but as a beginner, I am hooked.
While I like the fact that the camera will take regular AA batteries, it of course eats them like candy & I've purchased NiMH rechargeables to use with it.
The few photos I have tried without bright light (e.g., just the lights of the Christmas tree) did not turn out as well as previous years with my 35mm cameras, but were still passable.
The 16 MB xD Picture Card that came with the camera filled up very quickly, & I plan to purchase at least a 128 MB card soon.
