            Who out there is not driving a Honda these days?  Honda, known for its reliability, good resale value and reasonable prices has consumers flocking to their dealerships.  I bought my first Honda this past March and I love it.  I opted for the Honda Accord EX, 4 cyl. model because it saves on gas and saved me some in my pocketbook.  Although I would have liked to have a V-6 engine in my car, the EX model offered me everything I wanted that the V-6 LX did not.  The 2000 EX model came standard with a cd player, dual AB, ABS, security system, alloy wheels, sliding sunroof, cruise control, etc.  Depending on where you purchase your Honda will impact how much you pay for the car.  In Florida, where I currently live,  the Honda dealerships were asking for over $22,000.00 for the EX model.  I opted to drive up to North Carolina to purchase my Honda for around $21,000 which includes tax, title and everything else.
Because I had to drive back to FL after purchasing my car, I was able to get a good feel on how the Accord handled on the interstate and how I handled having to sit in the drivers seat for twelve hours.  The Accord was a very smooth ride and the seats comfortable to sit in...even after twelve hours!  I really like the fact that I am able to see all the traffic behind me thanks to the large back window.  The only problem I have had with my Accord is when I am driving over fifty mph my drivers side mirror tends to shake a little and a Honda dealership told me they are not able to fix the problem.
Overall the Accord in an excellent buy and I would definitely recommend it to my friends and family.<br><br>
