            If you spell Toyota backwards and pronounce it, it sounds like, &quot;a toy yacht&quot;.  I can't say our 1993 Tercel by Toyota is a small yacht, but it is a reliable small car.  We bought it used in 1996 for around $7,000, perhaps not a steal, but it has proven to be a car that we are glad we got.

Since it is over 6 years old, I have to add a 1/2 a quart of oil every 600 miles or so, but that is not atypical for old cars to burn off oil quicker than new ones due to leakage.  We faithfully change the oil and filter every 3,000 miles.  Since we have been good to it, it has been good to us.

The one thing negative I can say about our Tercel is the back radio/stereo speakers were not securely designed.  The screws come out too easily and the speakers wires are too easily disconnected by accidently touching them when you load and unload the trunk.

All in all, for those you need a solid small car for transportation and don't need to drive in great luxury, Toyota Tercel is a good choice.  Besides, since the Toyota Camry is the car that thieves like best, it is nice to know that our car is an unlikely vehicle to be stolen.   <br><br>
