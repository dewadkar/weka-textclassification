            We upgraded from a 1995 Eddie Bauer Ford Explorer to a leased 1999 Mercedes Benz ML320.  We'd looked at getting another E.B. Explorer, but decided on the ML320 because of the safety record and reputation of the dealership.  We felt the Mercedes dealership didn't pressure us into buying (not a &quot;typical car sales type of experience&quot;), and that they were very attentive to our needs.

The service at the dealership has continued to be as stellar as the experience of buying - almost 1 year later.

The driving experience with the ML320 is phenomenal, and really feels like you are driving a car.

All and all we are happy with our purchase, but there are a few 'cushy luxuries' we didn't get with the ML320 that you get with an Explorer.  

The ML320 has terrible heat regulation throughout the vehicle.  Regardless of how you adjust the temperature, the heat cycles do not remain the same - one minute it's dripping hot, and the next minute it's chilly cold.  In addition, the heat near the driver's side feet is NON-existant!  Believe me - you will freeze!!!  When we talked to the MB dealership about it, the service manager said that Mercedes had always been that way, and even if you lit a match &amp; held it down near the feet with the heat on high, that it would not blow out the match...  Let me tell you - he was right!  BRRRRR!!!

The other thing that I don't like about the ML320 is that the CD changer is at the back of the vehicle.  There is no single CD player on the dash, so unless you're very organized &amp; remember to put in CD's, your CD player may get little use.

The interior of the ML320 is not nearly as &quot;cushy&quot; as the Explorer, but we knew that and still willingly purchased the vehicle.

There was a recall the first year - the seat belts &quot;could&quot; come unlatched in an accident (scary).

Don't get me wrong...  we love our Mercedes, and are happy with the purchase.  But, if you are considering the ML320, be aware that there are things in the vehicle that could've been designed differently.

One other thing...  because of the amount of vehicles sold by Ford, they have the flexibility of offering better (lower) percentage rates on the finance of the vehicle.  So, for us, the Explorer payment would've been $100 less a month!

Recommend to a friend?  Definitely - with conditions and warnings!
Would we buy again?  Probably not - we'd probably go for the Eddie Bauer Explorer!<br><br>
