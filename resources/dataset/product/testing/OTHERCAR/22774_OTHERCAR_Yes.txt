            I bought the car used in November 1998. I live in the Midwest and deal with a decent amount of precipitation per year. It creates some rustage problems over time with the carriage that have to be dealt with over time.

For the past year or two, I have had to replace several major parts including the muffler twice including the pipe system attached to it once. When the muffler falls off, it will tend to drag on the road if it doesn't fall onto the road completely.

I discovered through my Dad's fiance's friend that sometimes there is a problem when the heater is turned on for the first time of the cold season.  I had this happen fall 2002. I didn't have the problem in previous years though.

I did have some problems in keeping the automatic fluid within the car to an extent. It seems for the past year despite adding more that my car can't retain it. It did leave me stranded once on a road.

I do enjoy driving the Dodge 600 despite its problems within the past two years. I have put several thousand miles on the vehicle in four years.
