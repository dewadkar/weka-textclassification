            I have been a avid believer in the quality of Mazda vehicles since the mid-80's. I am happy to report that I have NEVER had problems with any of my Mazda cars.  I consider myself a kind of Mazda expert, considering that I recently bought my 3rd Mazda 626, and our family has owned a total of 5 Mazda vehicles.

In 1985, my husband purchased a Mazda pick-up to get him to work and back.  We had no problems out of the truck for the 9 years that we owned it.  We sold it in 1994 (to buy a larger vehicle) for a sum that was only a couple thousand dollars less than what we paid for it.  Talk about a good deal.

After seeing how well my husband's Mazda ran, I decided to trade in my Buick for a 1988 Mazda 626.  That was my first experience driving a Mazda (my husband's truck was a standard, and I couldn't drive it).  From the moment I drove it off the lot, I was in love.  I kept that car, also with NO problems other than regular maintenance, until 1995.  I sold that car to my sister.  Her son is now driving that car and even with 180,000 miles on it, that Mazda is still going strong.

Still in love with Mazdas, I purchased another one.  My only reason for selling the first one was because I wanted a new one.  This one was a just-released 1996 Mazda 626.  Just as with the first 626 I owned, I loved this one also.  I kept it for a little over 3 years.  It met its untimely demise in September of 1999 when my daughter wrecked it.  I was very upset, not really with my daughter (accidents happen...), but with the fact that my beautiful car was mangled beyond repair.  Alas, I cut my loses, and guess what I bought to replace my car...

You got it, another Mazda.  A 1999 Mazda 626 this time.  I have only had it for about 4 months, but I can already tell that I will have a long and happy relationship with my new car.  

Just to be certain that my 1999 626 does not meet the same fate as the last one, I bought my daughter a car of her own.  A 1995 Mazda Protege.  So far, I've had no trouble out of this car either.<br><br>
