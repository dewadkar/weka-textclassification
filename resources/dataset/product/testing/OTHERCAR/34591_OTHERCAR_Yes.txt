            As a college freshman, I was thrilled to get the gift of a 1997 Saturn SC2.  It was the perfect car for a college kid.  However, due to a twist of fate (I won a 1999 Mustang Convertable, see my other review) I sold my trusty Saturn.  Even now, I miss that great car.
Why is it so good for a college kid?  It is a great value wrapped up in a really sweet looking car.  My Saturn would consistantly give me 300 plus miles per gallon highway and 275 city on a tiny 13 gallon tank.  It was great to fill up every two weeks and only drop 15 bucks or so.
Another great cost cutter is the insurance.  Due to the great safety standards and crash records, my insurance for my Saturn was actually less than my old 1981 Chevy.  How excited were my parents when I told them that!
Finally, the car is extremely well built.  I kept it in great condition and it did the same for me.  The previous owner said he had one minor problem that was fixed in a few minutes at the dealer, and I never needed to go to the shop for anything... even after driving in the brutal Los Angeles conditions for over a year.
Almost as important as the value to me was the appearance.  The dent resistant doors are great (especially now that I have gotten my first dent in my Mustang).  I worked at a grocery store for a while and I know that I was just the only lucky one in the parking lot whose car did not get hit by a shopping cart.  The Saturn showed no damage even after a little nudge to the car behind me while backing out of a friend's house.
It also looks good.  This is not a cheap looking car.  It looks sleek and sporty.  My friends thought I had one of the coolest cars around, and I always felt confident and comfortable driving to work, driving home, or driving with a girl.
All in all, I do miss my trusty Saturn, I think every college student should very seriously at a Saturn when they hunt for a car to go to school in.<br><br>
