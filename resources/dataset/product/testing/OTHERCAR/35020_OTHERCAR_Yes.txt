            I have a 1998 Hombre which I have owned for 14 months.  I get between 26 and 28 miles to the gallon so it is good for someone who travels a lot. The truck has a nice design, looks sharp, and is easy handling. It hugs the road well and doesn't seem to be top heavy. It is good to keep up the maintenance on it and get the oil changed every 3000 miles. The longer I go past the 3000 mile mark the lower my gas mileage is.  I love my truck because it is very economical and compact made so easy to park.  The only complaint I have about the truck is that it is to small on the inside and can only carry two people comfortable.  So it is not good for a family. <br><br>
