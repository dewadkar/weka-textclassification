            I've had a go on a few digital cameras - a cheap, bottom-of-the-range iCam, a near professional quality Sony, and a mid-range Canon (very similar to this Fuji). I'm by no means an experienced user but there are a few things I can compare between the cameras I've used.

Price was a big concern for me, and the main reason why I bought this model. I got it from an online retailer for ï¿½168, which included an additional 16mb card, a mini tripod, batteries, additional software and UK delivery. I'm not sure the tripod and software would be a major swaying factor, but the card definitely was. I couldn't find another similar camera even close to that price range, even on auction sites.

Of course, everyone wants to know about picture quality first and foremost. The Fuji offers three sizes of picture, with different compression options, which allows users to pick the most appropriate format. I use the camera on its highest quality, largest photo setting, which allows 40-50 photos on a 32mb Smart Media card. The results are vivid, lively and clear. When pictures are uploaded and viewed at 100%, it is noticeable that they are digital - large areas of shadow have a grainy texture. I suspect this is not a problem for normal size prints. Shots display flawlessly when used as wallpaper on a 1152x868 desktop.

The features on the Fuji are very good. Pictures can be viewed individually or in groups of nine, and can be zoomed and cropped for digital printing. Most aspects of picture taking can be adjusted manually, and this camera has more white balance than you'll ever need. Shots can be erased individually, and the manual setting allows pictures to be saved or discarded as they are taken. Battery life is drained by the screen - this is a fact of life with digital cameras, and to be expected.

The camera performs extremely well in dim light without a flash... a slight orange hue, but not the striking red of some cameras. There's no infra red though, so you'll have to use the viewfinder, which is ever so slightly inaccurate and not suitable for precision shots. There are no options to convert to black and white or sepia. If you want to print directly without using your PC to check the pictures first, you may need this function, but I don't really miss it.

The screen is small, and this is something that has been criticised. I can't say that .2" less bothers me. I seem to remember someone else pointing out that it may not be comfortable for those who use their left eye with the viewfinder. This is true, as the screen sits square in the middle of the unit, and because it sticks out I think it would make picture-taking a bit uncomfortable. I'm right-eyed, but I've only used the viewfinder maybe twice in 650 pictures, so don't let that sway you too much.

Bear in mind also that this camera has a 'real' zoom, not a digital zoom. Digital zoom is equivalent to enlarging a scanned picture, and therefore isn't really a true zoom. I cannot stress how much of a difference this 'real' zoom makes. If one feature should sway you over other cameras, this is it. I gladly give up the .2" of LCD and sepia conversion for such an essential feature.

Complaints? I suspect one way Fuji cut the cost was to only include a 4mb Smart Media card. With card prices coming down steadily, I wouldn't base my review on that fact. However, it isn't sleek or out to wow your friends (noticeably thicker than the Canon, but small enough to fit in a regular camera case). The thickness seems to be due to the raised LCD screen which has no protection from impact. It's very prone to getting scratched and I think this is the worst feature. Sitting it on its edge is the only way to overcome that.
