            We first bought this van because I was doing a home daycare.  I needed lots of room that a car just couldn't give me.  It has room for the carseats, toys, diaper bags and children!
I love the room in this van!  We have room enough for 8 eight but seatbelts for only 7.  Plus ample room for anything we might need to haul.  We have taken out the seats and hauled garbage, plywood, firewood, drywall, windows, doors, helped people move and tons of other things.
This is perfect for a large family or someone that needs a truck like utility without giving up seating.
This van just glides down the road.  It is easy to drive.  However, the gas mileage is not the best.  Currently we get appx. 17 mpg.
We have had no problems with this van, never been serviced.  We change the oil regularly, put brakes and tires on it and make sure we keep it up well.  When we purchased it it had appx. 90,000 miles on it 2 1/2 years ago.  We have appx. 145,000 miles on it now. We have taken it into Canada, mountain camping trips, to the coast and all our vacations.  We have a family of 4 (sometimes 5) and two large dobermans and this van holds up to everything we throw at it.
One thing we would like to get repaired is the headliner fabric is coming loose and the sliding door sticks from time to time.
I don't know what I would do without my van!
