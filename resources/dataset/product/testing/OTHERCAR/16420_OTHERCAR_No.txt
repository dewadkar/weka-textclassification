            I purchased the Nikon Coolpix 775 around November 2001.  I purchased the camera exclusively for taking Christmas pictures of my family & making a video for distribution to the family members.  The camera did take pictures very well at first but after downloading the pictures we noticed white spots on the pictures that were taken.  We utilized a cloaning feature on a particular photo shop editor that we had purchased that covered this problem.  
I did call the Nikon help line with does have a very quick response but they were clueless on the spots so we just have been living with it.  We have now sent the camera for repair due to when we take a photo w/o using zoom the picture is very clear but if we even zoom into the scene at all the picture becomes very dark.  I believe that there is a issue with the lens or CCD but unsure.
The camera is extremely slow when taking pictures and it takes a few seconds for the one picture to store before you can take another picture.  Turning the camera on is slow and not very instant at all.  If you want to review a picture you took it does take a little bit of time & don't even think of deleting a picture the hour glass seems like it lasts forever.  
I would not even recommend this camera & I am comparing this to my Sony 8mm which has been fantastic & my old JVC vhsc which has been zero problem.  I know that I am comparing the quality from a camcorder to a digital camera but when I have a 10 year old JVC & 1 yr old Sony they are w/o a problem.  I have a Pentax 35mm that 8 yrs old & takes beautiful pictures & been dropped from all sorts or heights.  I'll update more after the camera comes back for repair which knowing most warranty service companies they will want some money or blame the consumer.
