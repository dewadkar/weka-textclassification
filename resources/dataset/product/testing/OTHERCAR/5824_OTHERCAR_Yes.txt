            My wife and I bought the D-490Z for ourselves this Christmas.  

We had both borrowed digital cameras from work and decided to get the D-490Z.  We liked some features of other cameras but thought that this one had a good balance of options.

When set on "high quality" this camera takes great pictures.  When it's on "super high quality" the pictures are outstanding.  When you download the files and zoom in on them, the detail is unbelievable.

The 3.x optical zoom is wonderful.  We have been able to take some extremely detailed pictures.

The fact that the camera also uses AA batteries is a plus.  I did not want to have to spend time recharging the camera's battery.

Having to remember to pop up the flash has been a problem.

This camera would be perfect if it came standard with a USB cable for downloading pictures.  The default serial connection is VERY slow.  Although, I did get a free USB card reader from Olympus which has greatly improved download time.
