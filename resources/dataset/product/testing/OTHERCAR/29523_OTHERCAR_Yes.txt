            I did a lot of research (mostly online) on digital cameras before buying one, and have been really happy I chose the DC-240.  It almost always produces good quality images, sometimes even in very difficult conditions.  The placement of controls and the overall design are excellent; the only criticism I have in this area is that the LCD screen gets smudged easily and the owner's manual gives no advice about cleaning it other than a damp cloth; I suspect this is a problem on all digital cameras.

I'm also pleased with what's included with the camera:  both regular and rechargeable batteries, a battery charger, and multiple computer and video connectors.

There seems to be no other camera with all of these features (1.3 megapixel, digital &amp; optical zoom, etc.) for anything near the price.  The next one up in the Kodak line (DC-280) is substantially more, and lacks some of the features of this one.  If you shop carefully (especially on Ebay.com and Mercata.com), you can pick one up for under $400.<br><br>
