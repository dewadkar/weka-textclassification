            I've owned the Jeep grand cherokee for almost two years....It's an excellent vehicle. I've always owned a cadillac, so changing to a 4 wheel drive sports utility vehicle was quite dramatic. I really do love it. It makes me feel safe on the road in all kinds of weather. It's easy to get in and out of even if you are 5 foot two like me. I like the roominess in the back for such things as our two dogs and lots of groceries. We get between 16-18 miles on a gallon of gas. We have never had any problems with the vehicle. I really care about dependability..The lease is up soon and we plan on buying a 2000 limited model. Our friends own a Ford explorer, but i think our jeep is prettier. The stereo is great. The one and only draw back is the ash tray is placed out of reach, so I guess I'll just have to quit smoking. Pretty car...    <br><br>
