                 I'm writing about my 97' Prelude.  Man this thing is fast, I have the sportshifter thing, man that is cool.  I can throw it in drive to cruise around or shift manually and race all of my fellow high schoolers who think there car is fast.  I'm not trying to give this car to much hype. But it has the bang for the bucks.  With a few minor tweaks to the engine I picked off a web page, I've been able to blow away Mustangs, and Most Camaro's and Just about any other supposibly fast car.  Hello people were talking about a 4 cyl. vs. V6 and some V8, and it still holds it's own.  The main thing that blows me away is the handling, It has awesome response to the exact milisecond you turn the wheel.   

     Another great thing about the prelude is Luxury, It's fast yes, but with the cd player, sunroof, spoiler, and leather seats this car is totally awesome.  I would recommend this car to older teen's or young adults.  But if your 16 like me your insurance is gonna be high, unless you got connections. Like your parents getting insured on it.
