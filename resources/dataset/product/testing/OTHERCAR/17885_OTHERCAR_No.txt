            I own a 1990 Chevy Blazer and it is the worst car I have ever owned. We owned it for 2 months and everything started to go wrong. We have had trouble with the windows not rolling up or down . the fan in the air conditioner and heater went out. The back seat will not fold down like it is suppose to . the latch on the spare tire won't latch and the seatbelts dont always buckle.there are even more problems but some are trivial and there are far to many to mention them all. I have a friend who has this same car and she says that she had these problems also. Im not sure about the new blazers but after my experiences with this one I will never buy another one.<br><br>
