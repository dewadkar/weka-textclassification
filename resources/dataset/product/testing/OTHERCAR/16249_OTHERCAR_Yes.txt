            The Toyota Corolla is my first brand new car. At the beginning of 1999, I purchased a new model. I test drove many others, and was impressed with some. But, none knocked my socks off, like this Toyota. Right from the second I walked into the showroom,I felt special. It was like I was the only customer there, in my salesperson's eyes. (honorable mention, therefore to freehold Toyota, in New Jersey)What's good about this car? First of all, I'm a &quot;big car&quot; kinda guy. My price range didn't allow for a larger model. So, I was impressed with how &quot;big&quot; the Corolla felt. It doesn't look like a small car, in it's design. It doesn't feel like one, when you drive it. The solid feeling was very comforting, the minute I got behind the wheel. As my test drive continued, I turned the radio on, naturally. It comes standard with AM/FM cassette, although many upgrades are available. The controls are easy to read, at a quick glance, without having to take attention off the road for too long. I must admit, however, the sound is not very impressive. It's adequate for most purposes, I suppose. But, for those interested in higher quality sound, I suggest an upgrade. The gauges are all clearly visible, and easy to read. And, the power door locks, power windows, and cruise control make this feel like anything but an econo-box. Comfortable seats, a smooth ride, and the most reliable engine ever built round out the good points to this machine that I now treasure. I wish the cupholders were better designed. But, hey, that's not too hard to deal with. The Toyota Corolla is highly recommended by this fella. <br><br>
