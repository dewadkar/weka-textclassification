            I have bought my veedub used. Soon after I was married, the time hath come to buy a family car. After countless hours spent on the internet researching cars and prices, I(we) finally decided on VW Passat Station Wagon. It was jet red color, with 5 speed manual transmission, in very good condition (we bought it used). 
First of all, VW Passat is made with quality in mind(Made in Germany), this is my second Passat, as I bought 97 Passat GLX VR6 just few months ago, and I have not had any problems with either one. As long as I keep them well maintained (I mean checking oil and fluids more than once a year, as some "drivers" do!), they both keep running and running. 
Inside the car is very roomy, 5 tall(6') people can sit inside comfortably for long trips. The seats both front and back offer plenty of support. The cockpit is designed with safety and convenience in mind; all the controls are exactly where they should be. None other car gives me that "homey" feeling when I drive it. The only thing I wish the Germans added was the glove compartment. Otherwise this car has got all kinds of storage compartments, pockets and other places to store you goods.
Exterior is also designed with smooth lines, and unlike any japanese car, Passat looks good and at the same time you can distinguish one from the crowd.
Engine I've got is 2.0 liter 16V powerplant that is adequate for this kind of car. It's not a screamer but has enough power once mated with 5 speed manual. It is very quiet, even on the highway. If you prefer automatic tranny, get VR6 for the engine loses 15% of its power with automatic. Few parts I had to replace were kind of expensiver and only available at the dealership. Transmission is a bit too trucklike. The shifts are long, and if you try to shift too fast, you might get that pleasant grinding noise.
Overall the car is reliable, I drove it on numerous long trips. Comfort inside the car is almost like that of the minivans. The ride is soft, yet car is cornering like a sports coupe, and you can load an elephant in the trunk(remember it's station wagon, I don't know about sedan).
I would recommend it to those who have families up to 4, and don't want the minivan bulkiness and poor driving habits.
