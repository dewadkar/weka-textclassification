            Through various reasons, I inherited a bright red 4-door 2001 Old Alero GL in October 2002. It only has 9K miles on it and still smells and looks new. I was excited about getting this car as I had recently sold my 410 horsepower hot rod and was missing having a "fun" car in my garage.

The Driver's Seat
First thing you notice (not sure if GM did this intentionally) was a retro placement of the ignition...it's not on the steering wheel but on the dash. That's a cool little trick. You fire up the (in this case) 3.4 liter V6 with a moderate rumble and you know this isn't just a grocery getter. This motor has 170HP and 190 ft. lbs of torque backed by a 4 speed auto trans. There are plently of aftermarket hop up parts for this combination...including a supercharger!

I'm used to quick revving, hard pulling cars...and the Alero doesn't dissapoint. Turn off the Traction Control, mash the pedal, and you'll spin the wheels much to the local police annoyment...ah just like being 18 again (I'm 39).

Ok...any car can go fast in a straight line. With a fully independent suspension, the Alero corners and turns quick and tight. It's really a blast to squirt in and out of traffic in this Lil' Red Racer! Only negative I can say (and I've read it elsewhere) is that the seat bolsters need to be raised to hold you in place more. If you really took a hard turn, you'd likely slide out of the seat!

Master of Your Domain
The interior layout is well thought out and looks custom as the dash carries over the color of your seat fabric on certain panels. I've owned custom cars and the Alero's interior is very tasteful and almost looks custom. All controls are in fingertip reach.

What Could Be Improved
I personally would like to see a high performance version of the Alero...something in the 250HP range would make this car scream! It really is a great platform to put up against the import "tuners" and show them Detroit still puts out capable vehicles. 

Additionally, I wish the gas filler lid had a slot for the cap so it didn't dangle. Other than that, the car is a pleasure to drive. With extended length fluids (radiator good for 6 years/60,000miles, transmission fluid good for life of car) maintenace costs should be very low.
