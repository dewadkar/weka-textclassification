            I first looked at the DC3400 last winter (I originally looked at the DC 280) and, after doing extensive research on CNET and other review sites, decided to buy one. And I can tell you, it has been worth every penny! 2.3 megapixels make for some beautiful pictures, believe me. Plus, it's really easy to use, relatively lightweight, and has lots of cool functions to boot. You can do limited photo editing on the camera, but the real fun starts when you download your photos to a pc. The software is exceedingly easy to use, and most amateur photogs will not need any other features besides what comes standard. Did I mention how great the picture quality is?
There are some downsides, such as limited battery life. I'd recommend always having two sets of rechargeable batteries on hand.
Also, the standard 8 meg memory card is not enough for anything more than a weekend away, if that (just like any other digital camera). Upgrade the memory capacity at your first opportunity; a 32 meg card should suffice. I bought one, and together with the 8 megs that it came with, I have never had a problem, even on 10-day-long vacations. 
My biggest gripe with Kodak is that the camera did not come with a carrying case. I was extremely disappointed with that, since (in some places) this is a $700 camera! But for around $30, you can buy a good-quality case yourself, as I did, so overall it's a small gripe. More of a pet peeve, really. 

Overall, this is a high-quality, easy to use, fun camera that will save you at least it's cost in photo developing fees alone in a year, two at most, depending on how much you pay for yours.

Now, about the cost: I saw it in some places for as much as $689, but trust me, search the web and you'll find it for   $400, sometimes even less. I paid $425 for mine, but I have seen it for as little as $389.
