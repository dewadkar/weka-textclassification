            5/16/2001 UPDATE!

I am happy to report that now that I have over 30,000 miles on this car my opinion has not changed. It is an excellent car.  I have had absolutely no problems.
__________________________________________________________
I've owned a Honda Accord LX 4 door sedan with the V6 for a year now. Absolutely no problems in 15000 miles. It has plenty of zip for changing lanes, handles really good in corners and will turn on a dime. I like the gas milage I get- high 20s in town and over 35 on highway. 

I bought it at one dealership and have it serviced at another which is closer to home.  Both dealers have excellent service departments (hopefully this is true of honda dealers in general).

This is a fun vehicle to drive. Steering is very responsive, you have good visability all around, the acceleration is there if you need it, the instrument panel is easy to read, rear passenger comfort is good, everything I look for good dependable transportation is there.

My only complaint is that no matter what adjustment I try( and you can adjust it every way you can think of), the drivers seat kills me on long trips. I've taken it on two 3000 + mile trips so I know. Now everyone else who has driven it say I'm crazy, they think it's comfortable, so guess it's just me.
