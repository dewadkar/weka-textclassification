              Alright, I admit it, I went through a shallow point in my life where I thought I looked great, and bought things to accentuate that.  So, of course, when I was looking for a new car a few years back, I wanted one that my friends and I would look good in when we were cruising around!  The Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder GS immediately caught my eye!  It was small (like me), curvy, a convertible, and cherry red!  I fell in love immediately!

  When my best friend and I went to look at the car, we were greeted by a salesman, who let us take it for a test drive.  The ride was smooth, the stereo was pumping, we were getting stares....we would take it!  (Did I mention we were shallow?)

  The car I ended up with was great.  I ended up leasing it, because at that time, I couldn't afford to purchase it.  (Of course, now, I am very glad I only leased it...but more on that later!)  I got a Saronno Red Spyder with a black rag top and gray interior.  And, of course, I got as many cool options as I could.  

<b> The Basics: </b>
  The 1998 <b> Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder GS </b> is a 2-door convertible with a 4 cylinder, fuel-injected, 2.4 liter engine.  I leased a 5-speed standard transmission (I like being in control *grin*), but you have the option of buying an automatic, which is a bit more expensive.  The car gets 22 miles per gallon in the city and 30 on the highway, which suited me well.  

  The car also has some great safety features (if you can get past the fact that if you roll it...you aren't going to be unscratched) including dual front air bags and front and rear crumple zones.  

  All the Spyders have an electric top, which means you press a button, and you have an instant suntan (unless it's raining, of course).  I loved the ease at which I could put the top down...no struggling!  One note on the top though...you cannot put it up or down while the car is moving, as it doesn't work.  This is a nice feature though, in case you have some silly friends who think it would be fun to put the top up while going 60 mph!

  The car also comes with air conditioning, tilt-steering, power windows and door locks, remote trunk release, tinted glass, rear window defroster and halogen headlamps.  And, my favorite part....the stereo system!  I got an AM/FM cassette/CD player with an amp and 8 speakers.  The basic stereo usually just has the CD player, but I like having the cassette too.  And the cassette player has a neat little option where if you press fast forward on it, it will go to the next song.  I just love that part, so that I don't have to guess when to stop it.  Yes...the littlest things make me happy:)

<b> Other Options: </b>
  Some other things I got with my car were floor mats.  Don't ask me why, but those are extra.  I got an appearance package, which included a rear spoiler, wheel upgrade, fog lamps and a chrome exhaust tip.  I also got the convenience package which has the cruise control and keyless entry system.  Did I mention the cool stereo I got?  I thought so:)

<b> What I like: </b>
  So, what's so great about this Eclipse?  Well, first of all, it's a convertible!  I loved the feel of wind in my hair, sun on my face....and of course, the winks and honks from cute guys!  It was also pretty cool driving down the road when it was 60 degrees with the heat on and the top down.  Yes....people with convertibles are a little nutty *grin*
 
  It also drives great!  I could weave in and out of traffic with just the flick of my wrist (not that I would...).  And it handled corners beautifully!  

  I've had the car for three years now, and have had no problems with it.  Other than the usual oil changes, it's never had to go to the shop.  And, I'm happy to say....I've had no accident in it!  (It's that quick handling, I'm telling ya!)

<b> What I don't like: </b>
  Yes, unfortunately, there are things about this car I didn't like.  First of all, it is extremely low to the ground.  I often forgot that when parking, so I would hit the concrete barrier quite a bit.  It's also hard to go over any grades when turning into parking lots without hearing that scraping sound.

  If you have kids, this car is a definite no-no.  I found that out when I had one of my own.  His car seat fits in the backseat...but barely.  This car was definitely not made for the married with children crowd.  And, I never really feel safe with him in the car....so needless to say, it's not driven much anymore.

  Speaking of the backseat....it's tiny!  Trying to actually fit anyone back there is a struggle...  I even had trouble fitting back there, and I'm short!  It's hard to get in and out of the backseat as well.  The cars great for two people, but any more than that, and you might want to rethink your plans.

  I love the convertible top, but I have found that it leaks in a heavy rainstorm.  It's not a horrible leak, but enough to make me notice it.  And, oh yes...don't leave your top down in a rainstorm....trust me.

  And my final complaint....the driver's seat doesn't recline back!  And, I'm not talking about lying it down all the way back, but just enough so that I'm not sitting on the steering wheel!  I guess that's just something with the Spyder's, but it certainly was annoying!  

  Overall, I would definitely recommend the <b> 1988 Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder </b>.  I would also recommend leasing it, rather than buying it!  (Especially if you plan on having kids anytime soon...)  I would say it is in the mid-range for sports cars pricewise.  To buy my car outright, I would have paid a little less than $24,000, with all the options.  It's a very sporty car which drives like a dream and looks like a million.  And yes...it's a single woman's ideal car!  (Trust me...I bought the car, and less than a year later, I was married *grin*)
