            We were looking for a small SUV with 4x4 and some luxury.  We looked at the RAV4 and CR/V, then found out the Escape/Tribute would be out in the summer of 2000.

I'm glad we waited.  We bought a Tribute ES with Luxury, Towing and ABS/sideairbags packages (exactly the combo I wanted.)  

PROS:
Acceleration and braking
Interior space
Dashboard / gauge layout
Huge moonroof (luxury package)
Huge console between front seats
Three DC outlets
Spare tire hidden under rear floor
Tailgate swings up - glass can be opened separately
Great lines
Front drive economy until 4x4 is needed
7 CD changer standard with luxury package
Lots of little storage bins and crannies

CONS:
Plastic on doors where some token leather should be
Shift handle is on steering column, and is too long (automatic trans)
Cheap sunvisors with unlighted mirrors
Front seats are a little firm for my taste
God-awful ordering system in place at Mazda - very little info about
    ordered cars until they roll off the truck
Firestone Wilderness HT's standard - B-rated for traction
Spotty history with a bunch of recalls during rollout
Mazda underestimated the demand for higher trim levels, and made poor
    choices on what to make.  So the LX and ES models are still scarce.

The Trib accelerates briskly, stops quickly, and handles more nimbly than my Nissan Altima did.  I have very low mileage on the car as yet, so I don't know about MPG.  There are three different trim levels, DX (entry), LX (intermediate) and ES (higher.)  Prices range from 18-25K.
