            What is it with this car and my family? My sisters had a 93 and 02.  My step mom has the Matrix(Corolla wagon).  Heck my wife and me had a used 91&#146 that saved us from headaches ($$$) while we where in college.  Why do we keep going back to the Corolla?  Why does Shaq dunk all the time?  Reliability&#133. it&#146s the main reason Corollas are likable and grow on you.   The little Toyota usually never lets us down or stranded.  It always ran like a top and trips to the shop were usually just for routine maintenance.

The Car
We took the dreaded 5-year plunge and financed a white Corolla LE.  This 4 door only car comes in 3 models CE, S, and LE.  The CE is a base model.  Its not that Spartan at all since it comes standard with AC and a CD player.  But I didn&#146t like the skinnier 14inch hubcap tires.  The S is the sporty version in &#147looks only.&#148  I skipped this model because the racer body kit looks awkward.  So the winner was the LE, which is the model that gives you the most standard features.  And TA..DA&#133 15inch tires, 16&#146s would have sweet but oh well.

Exterior
The 2003 redesign finally gave the Corolla some style.  This is a much better looking car than the previous 98-02 model (nice but CRAMPED).  Some say it looks like a shrunken Camry.  I&#146ll agree with that assessment, but add a sprinkle of Volkswagen influence here and there.  Love the fact the door handles match the color of the car instead of being black.  

Equipment
The stock LE basically gives you all the convenience you need.  It has standard daytime running lights, power windows, mirrors, door locks, air condition and yes CRUISE CONTROL!  For safety there&#146s front airbags and seatbelt pretensioners.  Our car has no ABS brakes but they are an option (hard to find maybe?).  The stock single disk CD player/radio has four speakers and to my surprise it sounds good.   

Interior
The interior is typical Toyota, very well made and everything is where they should be.   This is the roomiest Corolla yet and that was a big selling point for us.  You can fit 2 adults in the back comfortably.  The driving position is fine for me, but for taller drivers (6ft) it might be cramped.  If you push the seat back you&#146ll feel that the steering wheel is a reach.  If you move the seat forward, you just compromised your legroom.  The instrument panel has a green on white theme that works well at night. There are lots of nifty storage areas in the front.  Like 2 in the dash for CDs and the center armrest opens up for more added space.  I don&#146t care for the fake wood, but it doesn&#146t make the interior tacky.  The climate control switches are well organized and no buttons are a stretch to get to IMHO.  The trunk is spacious for it&#146s class and the fold down rear seats comes in very handy.  

Performance
The only available engine is a DOHC 1.8L 4 banger that is rated at 130hp/126 Ib-ft of torque.  For flat out power and speed, it will eat the Acura NSX for lunch!  Just kidding, we can dream can&#146t we?  Seriously the engine can handle all driving situations.  It&#146s energetic around town and handles the freeway fine.  It does get tossed around some during windy freeway driving, but I don&#146t find it a problem.  The 4-speed automatic is very good.  I tried the manual, which wasn&#146t that much peppier.  The automatic shifts smooth enough but is a little loud.  Handling is good but remember this isn&#146t a Celica.  Brakes work well and don&#146t deter my confidence. Gas mileage has always been a virtue with the Corolla; ours gets 28 with nothing but city driving. 

Reliability/ Durability
Now 20 months old and 36k miles later and our faithful friend is still humming along nicely.  Maintenance has consisted of oil changes, 1 air filter, and the other engine fluids as needed.  I haven&#146t rotated the tires because I want to get rid of the stock Firestones as soon as possible!  The engine bay is well organized and everything is easy to get to.  It also comes with a timing chain (less maintenance) instead of a belt.

In the end
As a young couple with shallow pockets, the 2003 Corolla was a no-brainer.  It&#146s a dependable commuter with a durable engine.  Throw in a stylish body, and a roomy interior (for a compact car).  These virtues were too good to pass up and we&#146ve been more than ecstatic about our purchase
