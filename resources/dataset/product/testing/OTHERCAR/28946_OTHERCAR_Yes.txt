            I will not  be re-hashing  all of the points in the previous opinions of this vehicle, but I will highlight the important parts.

The most significant point I wish to high light is safety.  I was involved in a major vehicular collision with this vehicle recently and I walked away with hardly a scratch.  Basically, I was T-Boned (broad sided) on the driver's side by a Mid Sized SUV going about 50mph.  The Rodeo Sport may be a "cute ute" with its two doors, and youthful appearance and ride, but it really held it's ground, and protected its driver.  That has been the great part about the accident.  20/20 is always hindsight. With that said I wish the Rodeo Sport came with Side Impact Air Bags as an option.  The only injury I sustained was a little gash after my head struck the drivers side door.  Hardly worth complaining about, since the EMS were amazed that I was uninjured. But  it is a point that I ponder nonetheless.

Now on to one of the bad points.  Since the Rodeo Sport is technically in its first year (this vehicle used to be the Isuzu Amigo) getting a hold of one of these vehicles to buy (much less getting a hold of parts to replace on a crunched vehicle) can be quite a trick.  It will take 8 weeks to get my vehicle back because it will take 6 weeks just to get the parts they need to replace it. (Apparently, enough had changed between the 2000 Amigo and the 2001 Rodeo Sport to warrant waiting for the exact parts.) And my car is being repaired at the Dealer!  No middleman baloney.  Therefore, as of June 2001, they are still a little on the elusive side.

The Rodeo Sport has some really nice options.  The in-dash 6 disc CD player/changer is pretty nice.  The sound system is not bad in mine, but I bought it with the "premium" sound system with 8 speakers.

The dual sunroofs are pretty cool (available on the Hard Top model only) but it seems somewhat silly that they are not powered moon roofs.  After all, if I need to close the rear sunroof in a hurry while driving (sudden storm perhaps?) I physically have to pull over, open the rear door and close the sunroof.  I usually do not bother opening it at all for precisely that reason.

The remote keyless entry, power heated mirrors and power locks are a really nice option for a not-so expensive SUV.  The map lights in the rear-view mirror are nice as well.

There is quite a bit of cargo room with the seats folded up.  I tend to haul my three greyhounds with me wherever I go on weekends.  The rear seat fold up in such a way that it actually creates a barrier between the front passenger and the rest of the cargo area.  This is pretty nifty is your dogs like to try to hop in the front seats, OR if you are worried about having your cargo slide forward into the driver's compartment.

Conversely, if you want to haul around extra people, well that is another story.  Unless they like riding as cargo with the seats folded down, they had better be as skinny and nimble as Calista Flockhart.  It is not easy for me to get in and out of the rear passenger seating area, and I am not a large person.  Once you are back there, there is plenty of room!  However, getting back there is the problem...

Oh, in addition...  There are removable headrests for the rear seats.  I suggest removing them if you would like to see out the back window through your rear-view mirror.  Otherwise, they really hinder your view.

Over all, I am very happy with the vehicle.  If they totaled the vehicle after the accident, I would have bought another one.  It is fun to drive, getting cargo in and out is a snap, and the V6 engine really gives it a lot of power (Don't bother with the 4 cylinder, you'll be disappointed.)  The price is more than reasonable, and it really is a very safe vehicle.  You could not ask for more.
