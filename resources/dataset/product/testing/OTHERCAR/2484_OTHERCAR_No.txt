            My wife bought a Hyundai Elantra before we were married and I received the honor of having to end up paying for it. I can say that the Hyundai does handle well, even in snow here in NY. It has great grip around corners and overall acceleration is good. I can also say that I've received a lot of grief from this little car.

First this car was bought brand new, but had to have it's engine rebuilt within it's first year. The automatic transmission had to be fixed within it's second year because the car would not go forward when it was on &quot;D&quot;. Just peachy!!!!

Second while driving along one day I found my car's temp gauge had gone into the dreaded &quot;H&quot;. My car was overheating!!!! and the coolant was everywhere on my car. I checked the liquids and found that the cooling fans were not starting. The car's temperature gauge had blown, the one that measure's the temp of the engine to start up the cooling fans.  It also damaged some of the fuses in the fusebox by frying them where burn marks were visible. I tried to have this piece replaced by Hyundai dealers, but after two tries they couldn't get the part right. I then went on my own part-finding mission only to find that the part must be a figment of my imagination. That' what I felt like anyway because no auto part computer could bring up the exact match even though I was holding the part in my hand. I finally had my mechanic bypass this little part and have the fans turn on automatically each time I start the car. Cost to me - 50 dollars.

Then my automatic controls for the driver side window went out. The glass slipped into the door. I was surprised to find that Hyundai actually used parts this time that were easy to find. I got the window up and running for about 30 dollars.

Next on my car's agenda was to have both of it's sun visors stop working. A little spring in them apparently was broken and they now hung down covering half my vision. While driving I actually had to remove them and when I got glare I would reach over and put them back in place. I refuse to put any more money into this car with it substandard parts.

Now my fuel gauge has decided to go crazy. Everytime I fill up the gas tank it goes past &quot;E&quot; on the empty side and gradually builds up to the half way mark as you waste gas.

This car was obviously built on bad parts that's why the price tag was so low. It has given me many headaches and I feel trapped. I do not have the financial flexibility that allows me to purchase another car so I am stuck with this &quot;THING&quot; for another couple of years.<br><br>
