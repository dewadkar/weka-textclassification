            I have owned my Passport EX for 15 months and am still pleased with the purchase. I have driven Xterras, 4Runners and Cherokees in the last year and still find the Passport a better overall package. Gas mileage ~16 in the city and 20 on the highway. There was an initial period of about 2K miles when it was lower. I have used the 4WD mostly up in Lake Tahoe, in some of the worst weather last winter and spring and was very pleased with how well the vehicle performed traveling over roads which varied from ice patches to soft, deep snow to lots of rain. It corners well for its size and design, has great pickup and power. 

You are getting a truck, not a refined, up-on-stilts, car-on-a-truck chassis when you go for this vehicle. The cabin is reasonably shielded from engine noise, but I would not call it a quiet ride. 

It would be nice if:
The 4WD button was located differently. On the '99 model it is located on the dash to the left of the steering wheel in a group of three buttons: 4WD, Cruise Control and Fog Lights. I would have located to the right of the steering wheel, by itself, and relocated the rear wiper, washer and defrost buttons elsewhere. 

You could turn on the fog lights without the headlight being on.

Real Complaints: 
- Two recalls -- one for bolts which needed to be tightened on the rear suspension (fixed that immediately), another one for a dangerous visor hazard (Cmon, are they serious?). 
- Bouncing at higher highway speeds. Sometimes when I am cruising out at the speed limit and go over a small dip in the road, the vehicle keeps bouncing for 10 - 30 seconds more. I am tempted to get new shocks out on to improve the ride (if you have any suggestions, let me know). But the bouncing can be a little unnerving.
