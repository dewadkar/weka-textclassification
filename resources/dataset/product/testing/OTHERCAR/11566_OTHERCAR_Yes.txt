               For anyone who thought the Jeep Cherokee was a staid, old-fashioned and out of date vehicle - think again. The six cylinder engine is quick off the line and responsive at all speeds. It a proven performer that loafs at highway speeds, yet is there when you need it. Gas mileage is excellent. The interior appointments are quite nice and meet most standards. This is not a spacious interior, so while front seat passengers are okay, back seat passengers are a little cramped. Adequate cargo compartment and functional roof rack round out the hauling needs.

   The vehicle comes very complete with most accessories already included. The only real choice you have is color and power package. One item I consider mandatory is the ABS brake system. A great safety feature.

   Lastly, the price value relationship is outstanding - fully equipped, around $20,000. Match that against the value of the Grand Cherokee - which while a fine vehicle is in the league of the large suburban assault vehicles - at $28,000.
