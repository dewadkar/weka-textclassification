            I recently bought a 95 oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme SL with 50,000 miles on it, and I love it.  I was searching for a vehicle that was fairly big and that I could be comfortable in.  My Cutlass came with the 3.1 liter V-6, that has 160 horsepower.  It has good take off and very good power for passing and freeways.  The ride is quite and very comfortable.  There is a lot of room in the front seats if you are a bigger person, and there is plenty of room in the back seats too.  The truck space is good, but mine didn't come with a trunk release in the car which I find a little annoying if you want to open the trunk without turning the car off.  I have had absolutely no problems with my car.  On the bottom of my trunk there is a silver piece that the plastic inside of that is peeling.  I have noticed that on many Cutlass Supreme's.  It isn't very sporty but its a great looking car.  This car is very good for family's because of all the room, or anyone who likes the looks.<br><br>
