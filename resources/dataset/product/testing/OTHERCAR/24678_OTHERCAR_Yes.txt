            My husband and I were in the market recently to purchase a new minivan.  We test drove many models and for the price, the Chevy Venture LS is the best product on the market.  The van has dual sliding back doors (no more loading/unloading kids out into the street)and all models above the base model include keyless remote entry.  This is truly a necessity to anyone who works late or for a mother with their hands full.  
Our van has the individual bucket seats and seats 7.  The Venture has the option of 8 seats, but it is not a comfortable fit.  If you decide on an 8 seater, the middle and back seats are bench seats.  The individual bucket seats work great.  (No more bickering between siblings that their sister/brother are on their side of the seat)  The backs of each seat fold down and have indentations for juice cups/cans.  Each seat has the option of being removed.  The only draw back to the bucket seats is the middle row seats do not have arm rests.  The seats are arranged with 3 bucket seats in the middle row and two bucket seats in the back row.  To get into the back row, fold either side chair down.  Then the chairs side/fold up to allow entry.
Other options include a sunglass holder, mesh netting between the two front seats (no more briefcase/purse falling all over the place), power operated side windows, cd player.  
The drive is excellent.  The van is driver friendly and is a quiet ride.  The suspension is excellent even over rough terrain.  
The keyless remote entry, as I stated before, is standard in all models above the base model.  When pricing other mini-vans, for the same options I received in my Chevy Venture LS, the competitors wanted 28,000.00.
The back of the van (where you store items) is very roomy.  When I go to the grocery store, I have 2 carts full of product.  All of the bags fit into the back of the van with ample room to spare.  The van that we purchased also included a roof rack for additional storage space. 
The only drawback with the Chevy Venture is the owners manual.  For someone who has time to read it from cover to cover and play around with the instructions, it is fairly simple; however, for the time conscious person, the manual is difficult to decifer.
I am very satisfied with my purchase.  I feel that the Venture is the best mini-van on the market for the price.
The Venture's top of the line van is the WB (Warner Brothers) van.  This is also a nice product, but it is very pricey.  <br><br>
