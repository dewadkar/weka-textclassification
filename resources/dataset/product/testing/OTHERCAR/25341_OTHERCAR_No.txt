            I bought my 1999 Mystique in November because the 1996 that I had purchased earlier that year decided to blast me with white smoke from one of the heater knobs burning up.  There were also the 5 recalls on the vehicle that I did not like.

Some of the things that I really like about the car are the seats because they are really comfortable.  Both front seats are covered with leather; drivers side is automatic adjust with lower lumbar support.  The back seats have 3 full size seat belts with an armrest that comes down in the middle.  The car has air conditioning, cruise control, and ABS system.  The trunk is extremely spacious.  The dimensions on the trunk are approximately 5 ft wide, 4 ft. long and about 2ft. deep.  It also has a fuel injected, V6 engine, which is really nice for getting up to speed with the rest of traffic.  The car also has great handling capabilities around corners and in the constantly changing weather conditions.

The things that I do not like about the car is that since November of 1999 I have had to bring the vehicle in for many problems. I have had to bring the car in 5 times for the doors leaking, and once to have the shift fixed because it was rubbing inside the console. I recently brought the car in a second time for the engine rattling and they fixed it this time. The car also doesn�t get as good of gas mileage as they advertise it does.  It is finally getting better gas mileage then it was and that didn�t happen until they fixed the timing on the pistons.

The car drove really nice until the defects in the manufacturing started to show themselves.  Once are the problems were fixed the car seems to be driving fine so far but still waiting to see if something else happens.

I would not recommend this car at all because I do not feel save even driving this vehicle plus I would not want this same situation happing to another customer.
