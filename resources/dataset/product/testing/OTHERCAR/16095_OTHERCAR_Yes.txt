            This is my dream jeep I always wanted one since forever.I had tested driven one Oh God what a vehicle I thought I could die in this jeep.very smooth driving,comfortable,plushie seats,very spacious,booming system,a perfect body look inside and out,never want to get out of this vehicle.
I had test driven other jeeps but the Grand Cherokee is was my favorite. The over a performance of it compare to other jeeps I had tested was perfect.My brother and his wife own one and they couldn't be more happier about their purchase.I'm jealous,i am unable to purchase one at this time but believe me I will own one in this near 2000 and something future.
So if your out there looking for that perfect jeep, my suggestion is to go for the Grand Cherokee.You will get every bit of your money worths.<br><br>
