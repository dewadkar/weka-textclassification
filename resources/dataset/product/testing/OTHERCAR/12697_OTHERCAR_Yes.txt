            This is an awesome car.  I purchased it after my graduation from high school.  It rides very well, and is a very fun car to drive.  It gets great gas mileage!!  I purchased a Rally sport, which includes a back spoiler, and better paint job then the basic cavalier.  

One thing that I do not like about it, there is not a lot of room in the back seat, or the trunk.  I currently am playing hockey, and my hockey sticks will not fit in the trunk.  In the front seats, though, there is plenty of space.  The front seats are very comfortable, even for long drives.  Even with some back problems, the cavalier makes driving comfortable. 

I have had one bad experience with the car.  Within the past 6 months, the eject button on my cd player melted due to the light behind it.  But, it was easily fixed, they replaced the stereo component.  It has a wonderful sound system.  I love the way the stereo sounds.  The stereo is designed to get adjust the sound level with the level of noise coming from the engine, which does in fact work.  The stereo also has plenty of settings for stations, but also for the types of music, controlling the bass and what not.

I am very impressed with the handling of the vehicle in all types of weather.  I live in Michigan, so I have traveled through it all, ice, snow, lots of rain.  The traction control system works much better then I expected.  It handles very well, fast braking, easy turns, and acceleration has never been a problem.

In my opinion, this car is a great buy for a college bound student, or a younger person, just starting out.  Do not buy this car if you have kids, because there is not much space in the back seat.  This car would also be ideal for an older couple, who like to travel.  The comfortable ride, with the great gas mileage, makes it fun to travel in.  <br><br>
