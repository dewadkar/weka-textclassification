            Before I bought my Solara, I had a 1996 Lexus GS300.  I couldn't get used to the stigma (if that's the correct word) of such an expensive car, and wanted to downgrade to something more... earthy?  (I was 24 and in real estate, trying to create an image for myself, but I've moved on and I'm better now, and much more comfortable in my plain old Toyota.  We all do silly things.)

The performance if the Lexus DID spoil me, and I was prepared to sacrifice that.  My other choices were the Mercury Cougar, and the VW Passat (quickly dismissed as WAY overpriced after test drive).  I was about to decide on a Cougar when, what the hay, I test drove one last car, the Solara, and I was sold.  It feels just like my Lexus did, nice and solid.  Not plasticky like the Cougar.  And I got a four cylinder because I felt it responded just like the Cougar's 6, so what did I need 6 for?  (Hind sight has me wishing I had gone with 6, just for the fun factor, but 4 is really all you NEED, especially with this car.)

I've put 30,000 miles on this puppy and still love it.  Stereo could use some more bass, but I've been told I'm a freak that way, and the bass is just fine.  The trunk is huge.  The back seat is very reasonable and comfy for a two door.  It drives nice and smooth.  Mmmmm  yummy.  I had a little trouble getting used to visibility, but I'm only 5'2, so that's always an issue.  The power seat on the driver's side is great.  

One amazing thing happened to me:  like an idiot, I backed into a big ol' truck in a parking lot one day.  Completely caved in a corner of my rear bumper and scratched it.  But because of superior Toyota design and styling, IT POPPED ITSELF BACK OUT IN A FEW DAYS!!!  My car healed itself!  Now, except for the scratch, you can't even tell.  Okay, that completely impressed me.  And once I spilled an entire chocolate health shake on the passenger seat on my way to work, and the detail place got it all out without a trace.  Kudos to detail place, kudos to armorall, kudos to Toyota.  No kudos for me.  So you see, my car is resillient despite my most astounding feats of idiocy.

I'm waiting until I get sick of this car to buy a Plymouth PT Cruiser.  Dangit, it will be awhile, which is a shame because I really like those Cruisers.  ;)

Great car.  Buy it.  Love it.  Drive it until it dies on the highway - which could be awhile.<br><br>
