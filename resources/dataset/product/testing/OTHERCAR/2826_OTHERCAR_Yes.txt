            After 9 months I can honestly say that I�ve put the car through its paces.  The Lexus GS300 is a fabulous car.

It would not have been right writing this review prior to driving into the snow with this car.  Nothing major, but enough to get STUCK.  Yes, but I�ll call that driver error.  The special snow features that keep the tires from spinning uselessly when there is no traction WORK.  The anti-skid feature worked nicely when the rear end spun out slightly and I quickly regained control.

Oh yes, now I remember what I would love to see added.  If they would just tilt the side view mirror on the passenger side down when you put the car in reverse, that would be great.  But other than that I can't think of any other additions I'd like to see.

I thought about this car for about 6 weeks prior to actually buying it.  I wanted something with some muscle that was luxurious and comfortable.  Looks were important, that is why I added the Chrome Wheels, Gold Package and the extra wood inside.  These extras look great on Black Paint and a Tan interior.  If you are planning to invest $40k in this car splurge a little.

I chose not to upgrade the stereo but did add the 6 CD changer, another MUST!  With hours of great CD�s who needs to listen to the outside world.  In fact, when I am alone with a good CD on and the Moon Roof  open I FEEL FREE.  This car makes you LOVE to drive.  I keep looking for reasons to take a spin.  Good thing I am an Outside Salesman and get to drive a lot!

Sure I could tell you about the great acceleration and the fact that the ABS really does work.  Remember after 9 months, I�ve seen most of what this car can do.  I hope you don�t need to use some of the special features that are built in, like the ABS or the Anti-Skid but you�ll be glad that they are there if you ever need them like I did this year.

Don�t just blow $40k on a car.  Blow it on this one.  I am sure the 430 is great, but it doesn�t let you shift gears from the steering wheel and it�ll add another $10k to the cost.  Maybe that is worth it to you, but the 300�s acceleration is excellent.

I�ve comfortably fit 5 people in the car on a regular basis.  Even the Trunk is very roomy.  By the way, invest the $40 in the cargo net.  Way over priced at that, but it is great for groceries and other items you don�t want to have roll around the trunk when you are burning rubber out of the Supermarket�s parking lot.

I forgot to tell you about the drivers seat, fully adjustable with memory and electronic lumbar adjustment.
