            The Intrepid is our 5th Chrysler product and we love it. It is a family car due to it's roomyness  but yet a sporty car due to it's looks and powerful 6 cylinder engine. We needed a bigger car and the Intrepid sold itself in it . The trunk is enormous, the seats feel like recliners and there is enough footroom for everyone as well. We got a great deal on an Es 1998 model cause we bought it in january of 1999 and they had to get it sold.I love the Es version mostly because of the leather interior . My two year old will spill juice on the seat and all i have to do is get a babywipe and clean it up! No problem at all. I also love the Autostick feature. It's an Automatic for drives around town and highways , but then you can shift it in the Stickmode if you're going up a hill and need some more power or if you want to manouver the car through traffic it surely comes in handy. It's definetly a luxery car and i have had alot of people approach me and ask about it , all i tell them is that i would highly recommend it.We only had one problem with it so far and that was something with the Autostick. It only drove in 2nd gear most of the time and the stick mode didn't work at all but Chrysler was very fast and friendly and got it fixed in a couple of hours.<br><br>
