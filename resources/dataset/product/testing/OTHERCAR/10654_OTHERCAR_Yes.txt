            The Grand Voyager is the ideal car for the on the go family. It is the most convenient car i have ever owned. it has more cup holders than seats and features many driver friendly things such as easy out roler seats. The Voyager has done well in crash tests and get great gas mileage. It also gives a smooth and comfortable ride, and is great for long trips. The most influential feature in my deciding to purchase it was the remarkable amount of trunk space. It has more space than almost all it's competitors, and is less than all of them. If you want a car that will last a while, and won't break down, get a grand voyager<br><br>
