            I purchased the 2001 Celica GT in June, 2001, after driving a '98 Corolla and, previously, a '91 Corolla. As expected, the Toyota engineering is flawless. The car is tightly designed and nothing rattles. The cornering is very flat for a car of this price and is probably the Celica's biggest claim to fame, after its cutting-edge styling. The 140-hp engine, with an automatic transmission, is peppy, although nothing dramatic. It is capable of very fast speed once on the highway where 80mph feels very controlled. However, off the dime, the power is somewhat sluggish unless you like stomping on gas pedals, which I don't. The 5-speed manual would give a lot more pep in the low gears, but driving a stick calls for compromises in comfort. The brakes, although not ABS, seem more than adequate. The gas mileage is averaging around 32, which is very good for a car that masquerades as a sports car. The GT-S, which comes with 180-hp and a 6-speed manual, would be a better option since this car's competition, such as the new Acura replacement for the Integra, is much higher powered for about the same cash. You also get considerably more power in the newest 2002 VW Golf and Jetta for the same money, so perhaps Toyota should consider upping the engine in the Celica a bit. But the body of the Celica remains a beauty to look at. And it sits very aggressively with its rear end slightly raised. I opted out of the ridiculous looking 'spoiler' which is an affectation that should be banned from all street cars. I also rejected a moonroof, perhaps a mistake. The dealer threw in a Pioneer 6-CD changer, but it works on FM modulation and is less than CD-quality sound. Fortunately, the in-dash CD player is superb and the 6-speaker system is impressive in power and sound quality. I opted for split-spoke alloy wheels on 16-inch rims which look very sporty, although, in retrospect, 17-inch rims would look even better. You can't go wrong with a Toyota, and the Celica is no exception, whether you are a 47-year-old going on 25 like me, or a real Gen-Xer who wants a very cool ride.
