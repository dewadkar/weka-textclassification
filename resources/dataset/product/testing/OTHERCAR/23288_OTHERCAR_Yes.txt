              My first car was a 2 door 1987 Chevy Cavalier. It was never the nicest car on the block but with 206,000 miles it ran strong. Not as quiet as all the other cars it still took me to wherever I wanted to go.  It could fit up to eight people at one time with room to shift and windows clear. New clutch, muffler, brakes, shocks and tires as well as regular oil changes this car was awesome. $400 and a will to learn to drive a stick brought me into a legacy of Cavalier's. I have  got both my parents and brother to purchase new Cavalier's in the past year while selling my &quot;Stonermobile&quot; for a slightly newer '90 4cyl 2door 5 speed. This car not only runs great but has no rust and under 100k miles. $1290 was the price for this beautey but I don't think I could ever sell it for anything under 2k. Nice, sleek, economical and very pracitcal as well as dependeble makes Chevy's Caviler the best buy for almost anyone looking for any kind of car. Be it a sporty 2door Z24, or a more family oreinted 4door 4cyl Cavalier's are dependable, sporty, enexpensive, all around multi-tool kinda car. Nice, afordable and can be used for long trips, short drives, cruising with your friends or just getting away from it all. Tow boats, get grocieries or impress your friends with the ergonomics of its sporty interior.<br><br>
