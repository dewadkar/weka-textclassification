                 I am Canadian and own a 1996 Chrysler Intrepid 3.5 litre V-6. I have owned this automobile since new. It currently has 63,000 km on the engine. I love this car. It is roomy and has great acceleration. I am over 6 ft tall and need the extra head room. I do have one major concern however. Recently I was returning from vacation when my engine overheated. The diagnosis resulted in my water pump having to be replaced. This is my 3rd water pump. The initial pump was replaced under warranty at about 30,000 kms. The total bill was in excess of $900 Canadian. I was very upset to say the least. The car was no longer under warranty. 
     I wrote a letter to Chrysler Customer Service in Windsor Ontario but to date have not been reimbursed any money. I truly like my Intrepid with this one exception. If other owners of Intrepids have experienced similar problems I would appreciate hearing from them. If Chrysler has rectified this particular problem then I would not hesitate to recommend this motor vehicle to anyone.<br><br>
