            The Impala has come back as a cross between a family car and a sports car. I previously worked for a Chevrolet Dealership and was taught safety features to point out to customers. I thought the lesson on the Impalas features such as the speed compensated volume on the radio, the theft lock device also for the radio, new dexcool antifreeze, and various other options including safety features such as the crumple zones, dual air bags, safety beams in the doors, and the anti lock brakes,  would take all day. With that and the fact that the Impala did not loose its sporty looks and comfortable interior plus plenty of the new bells and whistles, I would highly recommend purchasing this vehicle for fun or family.  <br><br>
