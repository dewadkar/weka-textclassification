            After starting out with a 1.2 megapixel camera, the jump up to this 3.1megapixel camera was enormous!!!  What amazing quality and resolution this camera has to offer.  

This sturdy camera is a good size, easy to hold, point and shoot.  I especially like the lens cap that stays on when the camera turns on.

This camera is has so many options, that it's going to take a year for my husband and I to figure them all out.  But it only took us a short while to learn the basics, and discover how to point and shoot.  Soon we were taking pictures of everything around the house, including using the black &amp; white filter.

The camera has manual settings also, for anyone familiar with f-stop and light meters.  But it's not necessary, as the automatic settings are what we use for now.

My husband and I are very happy with our purchase.<br><br>
