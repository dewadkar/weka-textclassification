            My friend bought this car one week ago.  I must say that this car handles and rides extremely well.  It has a very appealing look, interior is extremely nice, and you also get nice power.  The inline V6 provides enough power for any driving circumstance.  I really like the dash-board and how the rpm/mileage overlap in a 3 circle diagram.  Another nice feature is the e-shift which allows you to manually shift even though the car is automatic.  The exterior is beautiful and rides like a charm.  We took it to the beach and I swear that it has to be one of the quietest cars around.  

Driving

The car drives like a dream!  The handling and the performance are truly exceptional.  It has low profile tires to handle sharp turns and a stiff steering wheel to maintain control.

Interior Features
DVD or GPS navigation is your options.  My friend purchased his with the DVD navigation system.  I guess the benefit in this case is that you don't have to pay monthly fees but then again you have to update the CD every so often to keep it up to date.

It has an in-dash CD player with Bose speakers.  Very nice actually - leather covering throughout.  The car has a backlit orange glow through the dashboard that looks very hypnotic at night.  Another nice detail is the sunroof and the automatic shifting - everything is placed egronomically efficent.  The E-Shift is in the steering wheel in case you want to add extra shifting power.

Available Models
There are two models - one is a station waggon type titled as a sportscross.  Personally I think it looks like an Audi mini-van.  The other one is the regular sedan, one is manual and the other automatic with E-Shift.  My friend purchased the one with the Automatic/E-Shift.

Exterior Features
The car looks like the new Infiniti G35 and will attract a lot of young customers from BMW beamers and Mercedes Kompressors.  The car is extremely smooth and reminds me of the Japanese sports favorite the Alteza.  Anyways, the 5-star rims and 4-disc breaks make this car very flashy.  My friend purchased the yellow model and believe me he gets a lot of heads turning.  It looks very sporty and the inline V6 will attract a lot of young enthusiast - I'm actually sold for this car.  The car not only looks like a gem but drives exceptionally well.


Safety and Security
Vehicle skid control and driver and passenger air-bags.  This car is a luxury safe sedan.  Anti-lock breaks and remodeled body molding have made this car one of the safest.  Obviously since it's geared to a younger audience statistics will be skewed because younger drivers = more accidents.  But this car has all the features of a larger luxury sedan.

******************************************************

I highly recommend this car if you are looking for something high-end but not too expensive like a BMW, Audi, or Mercedes.  This car gets the job done in looks and performance.  Also remember that Toyota/Lexus are one of the most reliable cars on the market.
