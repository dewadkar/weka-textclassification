            I was planning to buy a sporty car, so I ask my local ford seller to give me a Cougar for 2-3 days so that I could try it the way I wanted...

Of course the look of the car is great, with the &quot;edge design&quot; Ford has come up with.  But that is all !!

The first thing I noticed is the engine.  Even with the 2.5L 170HP V6, I wasn't able to race against a Z24 Cavalier..  Oh no! I thought, lucky I didn't bought it yet..

On the first day, I had problems with the power windows, they were making some strange noise when I used them.  Also, the interior is nice but SO cheap.  It always seems it will break down in pieces..

Well, at $27000 canadian, it is not worth the price.<br><br>
