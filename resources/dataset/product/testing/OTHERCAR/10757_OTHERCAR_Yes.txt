            It's like peanut butter and chocolate: big, honkin' V-8 and rear wheel drive.

I bought my 1992 Grand Marquis LS from a dealer.  The price was right, the features were right, the car is just . . . Me.  It has leather seats and steering wheel, it has power front seats, touchpad entry, power windows, power steering that is effortless, a solid V-8 engine and the float and feel of a big, American, land-cruiser.

That's what this car is, a land-cruiser.  Open the (surprisingly responsive) throttle on the 4.6L engine, on the onramp, hit the highway and forget the rest of the world.  Even in town this car corners well with the optional handling package.  It tightens the sway bars and adds air coils to the rear.  I use this baby as a pizza delivery car and I STILL get almost 20 MPG.  

The biggest drawback to the 4.6L OHC version of the Grand Marquis is definitely the repair costs if anything in the engine breaks.  A new timing chain for this baby is over $500.00!  Brake rotors can go for $100, and almost everything else mechanical is going to hit you in the wallet.  Keep the oil clean and you should be okay though.

The best part is, I only paid $1,779.00 for mine.  If you find one, or one of its siblings (The Ford Crown Victoria and Lincoln Town Car), buy it.  Trust me.

Update: 08-Feb-2004

I've had a little more time in this car, and a few things have caught my eye (and my wallet).

The gas door release button has popped off, the dashboard cracked, and the passenger side window doesn't go down anymore.  The antilock brake light is on and the check engine light blinks like a broadway sign.  The plastic on the doors creaks and there's a little oil consumption.  None of these things is a major problem for me, I can either live with it or I can fix it myself.

One quirk that I noticed has to do with the spark plugs.  I swapped out the old Motorcraft plugs with some Bosch Platinums.  What happened?  My miles per gallon went down.  I looked through a few message boards and found that there's some controversy about installing platinum plugs in this particular 4.6L engine.  I went back to the old Motorcraft plugs and the MPG went back up.  Weird.

In the car's defense, I put some seriously hard miles on cars.  Like I said, I use it to deliver pizzas and that's not easy on ANY car.  So even though things have started to fall off and break down, I still really can't complain about how the Merc has held up.  Compared to the Buick Park Avenue I used to drive, the Merc's doing okay.

Additional costs:
2 Oxygen sensors, about $100.00 for the parts.
Spark plug wires, about $80 dollars.
Spark plugs (DON'T USE PLATINUMS), about $20.00.
Oil changes, $44.15 a piece.  [Valvoline Max-Life 5W30]

After almost 5,000 miles of back road driving I have to say that if this deal came around again, even with the little annoyances, I'd still buy a Grand Marquis.
