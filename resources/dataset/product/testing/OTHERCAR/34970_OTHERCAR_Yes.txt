            We purchased our new 2000 Gran Prix in Sep. and we LOVE it.  We traded in a Chevy Astro van, and was very concerned on making the transition to a car from a van with children.  (ages 9 and 12)  The transition was very smooth.  The kids love the pockets in the back seat for their gameboys and books.  I love the fact I can zip around town and back up much easier than a van.  I personally would never go back to using a van again.  This car offers one of the smoothest rides we have found.  There is two drink holders in the back seat when you pull the middle compartment down, the only problem with this is if you have three people in the back seat. <br><br>
