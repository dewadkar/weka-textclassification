            I may a little biased in my opinions of these cars, but I think it is well founded.  I purchased my car used and have since put over 60,000 miles on it!  I have only had one major problem with the car.  It was a bad head gasket.  It cost me a about $700 to have it fixed.  I was told by the mechanic that this was common in these cars and that BMW actually made an update to solve this problem.

If you are looking to get attention when you drive your car, this has to be one of the most affordable ways to do it.  I have added many aftermarket goodies to my car and it makes it that much more eye appealing. Many items are available to suit any budget.

People respect you more when you pull up in a fine automobile.  A car says alot about you as a person and makes a statement about your success in life. I have found that just by driving it people take you more serious.  Funny I could have this much fun for only about 20 grand!

If you want cheap thrills and a great performing car? This is the ticket!<br><br>
