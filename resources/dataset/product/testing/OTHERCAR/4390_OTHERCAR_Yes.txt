            This is a great vehicle for anyone who wants the versatility of a very good offroad truck as well as a comfortable in town four door SUV.  My husband and I have had this truck off road in Arizona, California, Utah, New Mexico and Texas and have enjoyed its sure handling and capability at handling very steep grades, deep ruts and sandy loose soil on several trips to abandoned mine sites and ghost towns.  We have also noticed that it takes these trips with a lot more comfort than my 1997 GMC Sierra Z71.  
I have to admit that its nice having the V8 in my Z71 sometimes but I have to give the off road nod to the trooper in sheer trail ability.  The angle of attack is very good and the suspension reacts to large obstacles very well.  The Trooper is solidly built and has shown no significant damage on any of the trails we have taken yet.  The highway miles were pleasant as well and do not seem to be wearing on the vehicle either.  This Trooper was purchased new and still looks new even though it has been used as a truck for much of its life.

The 3.5 liter V-6 seems to be an adequate powerplant and we have had no trouble with the truck in this respect.  The mileage is fair and acceleration in the mountains is good.  I would be a little leary of towing in the mountains however.  I have not tried it but there is no substitute for V8+ engines in towing capability. I would like to see this vehicle offered with a much larger engine for this reason.

All in all this has been an excellent and reliable vehicle so far.  I cannot recommend the stock tires though.  They did not wear well and were a bit too small. <br><br>
