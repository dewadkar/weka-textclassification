            Been using this camera for 3 months. Taken hundreds
of pictures. I do like it. It's got excellent picture
quality at 1.3 megapixel maximum resolution (1280 x 960) or
smaller 640 x 480 pictures. I took it to Reno and got excellent
outdoor and indoor pics. Theoretically, film cameras have higher
resolutions than digital cameras, but really film pics seem dinky
and &quot;tired&quot; compared to digital ones. 

Camedia and Adobe software is included and gives thumbnails and
photo editing capabilities. In the camera, up to 122 lower resolution pics can be stored or 18 of the highest res pics. Other features are 2x zoom, multi-shot capability, autofocus, TV viewing, self-timer, panorama shots.

Limitations. Digital photography takes a lot of juice
and the Olympus D-340R is no exception. One round of shooting and
uploading will use up most of the four AA batteries. Olympus inexplicably
doesn't sell an adaptor at the retail outlets (I couldn't find any
at the Circuit City) The rep told me adaptors are sold on the company's
web site. Also uploading can be a major pain since the connection is
to the serial port (in my case the mouse port). So I have to unplug my
mouse and reboot and use the keyboard to upload. But for an extra $60
you can buy a floppy disk adaptor and forego this nonsense. The
manual is not user friendly. I had to call tech support twice to learn to upload. The first guy didn't know what to do. The second guy did. Apparently, Olympus likes to see some persistence from its customers.<br><br>
