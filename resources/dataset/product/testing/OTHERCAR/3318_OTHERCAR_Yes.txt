            I have to say that one of the most impressive cars that I have driven
has to be the volvo 740 turbo.  My uncle bought this car back in 1990
and is still running strong with a clean maintanence history.  This car
has power for straight aways, and on hills.  The first time I drove this
car I thought it was just a family car that was junk, but turned out that
this car is great along with it's safety standards and good quality workmanship.
The ride is smooth and bump free.  The wagons are very roomy anywhere you
sit.  I especially like the seat in the very back that allows you to 
look out the back of the car.  I recommend this car for families and 
anyone who likes safe reliable cars.<br><br>
