                 This is actually my dad's truck, but I drive it usually.  Our Z71 if probably the nicest vehicle we own.  The 350 engine is amazing, almost 217,000 miles and still going strong.  That's a lot of miles for any vehicle, especially a '95.  It does have quite a bit of wear on the engine, and the transmission has been rebuilt, but the truck has held up well.  It was bought from a company that my dad used to work for, and was used to commute (on a 3 hour trip) before we bought it, which explains the mileage.  It has been in three accidents, one somewhat serious that damaged the front fender (this happened before we bought it) and I have put it through the two other ones (more on that later).
     The truck it amazing.  I have pulled two different trailers with this truck, on long trips, and it has done well.  The only problem I've noticed during pulling trailers is that the worn engine can't accelerate at all with a trailer full of re-bar, and at high interstate speeds the weight made the trailer and truck sway quite a bit (needed a bigger truck).
    The Z-71 is pretty quick, even with 217,000 miles.  The ride is...truck like, but it doesn't bother me too much.  The front seats are ok, not bad, plenty of room.  The back bench seat is a little hard on taller folks (I'm 6'2'') and getting in and out is a task because you must enter from the passenger side and there is no third door.  The plain jane styling is cool, especially with the Z-71 package and some huge Michelins.  Off-roading ability is great, I just recently went with my friend, and the truck handled the not too serious red clay, small ponds, and steep inclines with ease (the ride was rough though).
     My biggest gripe with the truck is the turning radius.  That combined with the length makes it impossible to do any kind of maneuvering with.  I've run up on a few sidewalks making u-turns, and I gave the back corner of an Infiniti a beating in an attempt to park at the mall (one of the "accidents").  This thing is impossible to park, and I don't think it would be much fun in a slalom course.  The other thing I dislike is the gas mileage.  Because of the excessive engine wear (and the fact that it is a truck), it gets absolutely terrible gas mileage.
     All in all a great truck, fun to cruise in, good for work and play.
