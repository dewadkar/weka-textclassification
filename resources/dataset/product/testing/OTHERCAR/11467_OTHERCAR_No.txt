            I bought my 95 SC2 because I loved how it looked, and I was ready for a sporty car.  I loved it until it was almost 3 years old (and almost out of warranty).  First the alternator went out, luckily it was covered.  Then my engine froze up (even being serviced EVERY 3 months), they had to tear it apart to my sure it wasn't my fault(!?.  Saturn did replace my engine even though it was no longer under warranty....it had like 30,000 miles on it.  I had to pay some, but not the whole thing.  Then the clutch went out....but supposedly it went out because something was leaking on it...I paid for the clutch.  Fixed some other things...brakes, transmission seal....then the engine (new) is still leaking....so once again they tear it apart....too much oil pressure...they say the new engine is faulty. 

Once again I need a new engine....oh well this is an ongoing saga.  The people at the dealership are always nice to me.  However I still have 1) spent a lot of money I didn't expect to, and 2) had a lot of time with out my car...I was lucky I could borrow my folks.  I know that all cars have some problems but a car that receives regular service shouldn't be on it's 3rd engine with only 50,000 miles.<br><br>
