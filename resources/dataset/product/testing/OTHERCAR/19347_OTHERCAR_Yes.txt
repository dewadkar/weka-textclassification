            There's basically three main competitors in the Asian near-luxury car market: the Acura TL, Infiniti I30, and Lexus ES300. All three are excellent cars. Your choice ultimately boils down to individual taste. In our case, we went with the I30; your mileage, of course, may vary.

ENGINE: Buttery smooth; it's obvious why the engine has been ranked one of the best in the world.

STYLING: Interestingly, our biggest quandry was whether to go with the I30 (luxury) or I30t. Parked side-by-side, the I30t, with its larger wheels and bronzed headlights, looked almost like a different car. The wheels make a huge difference in the appearance; the 17-inch wheels and tires fill out the well much better than the I30L's 16-inchers. We passed on the sport package (spoiler and side-sills).

INTERIOR: Premium materials abound, from the leather on the seats to soft-touch dash surfaces. The only disappointment is the fake wood, although it does add a touch of warmth to the sage interior. The Bose sound system is awesome, though the bass can get a bit much for backseat listeners. New for 2001 models are radio controls on the steering-wheel and a rearview-mirror-mounted compass.

COMPARED TO MAXIMA: A common criticism of the TL, I30, and ES300 is that there's little to differentiate between their cheaper siblings -- the Accord, Maxima, and Camry, respectively. Although Nissan went through great lengths to differentiate the Maxima and I30, there are pieces that are obviously shared. Beyond the non-independent rear suspension, there's also the same Bose system and automatic climate control unit. 

The differences are in the details -- for example, the Maxima GLE has just one seatback pocket, while the I30 has two, as well as two grab assists. It may seem minor, but the differences do add up. The warranty package and dealer experience is also much better on the Infiniti.

PRICE: Reasonable, considering the total package and warranty. Our Titatnium/Sage I30t was negotiated down to just over $29K, MSRP $32K. A similarly equipped Lexus ES300 (with optional 16" wheels, HID headlamps, leather, and moonroof) would have been a couple thousand more.

So take a look at all of the opinions here and stick them somewhere in the back of your mind. Go ahead and spend some time (in person!) with all three cars and choose your own winner.
