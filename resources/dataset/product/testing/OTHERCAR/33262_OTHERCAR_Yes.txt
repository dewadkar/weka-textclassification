                 I bought my 2000 Nissan Frontier XE Kingcab basically because I really loved the raw power the engine delivered.  It is the fastest truck for its class and that was a major selling point for me.  Personally, I used to love my truck. Unfortunately I am one of the few who get a lemon.  I had extremely awful problems with my brakes and my dealership still hasn't figured out what it is.  I have already started the process of getting it classified as a Lemon. 
      It was a very nice truck before i had any problems.  I once went through a trail that a F150 4x4 got stuck in and I was able to pull him out with my Nissan (proud day for Nissan).  
      If your are a big guy like me (6-4, 225lbs.) then i do not recommend you to buy a Frontier.  Even with having the Kingcab it is still cramped and on long trips it is incredibly painful.  My main problem is the dash section that contains the radio, ashtray, and cigarette lighter is jutting into my leg space.  Also, if you are a big guy, get the adjustable steering column because I didn't, and I have to wedge myself through it to get in.  
       It received pretty good gas milage (25 mpg), and there wasn't any real problems with it(that is if you do not include the brake problem I had).  There was a recall on the brake lights, but nothing major.<br><br>
