            After doing research about digital cameras online, I went to Best Buy to try out cameras.  My top two choices were a Nikon Coolpix 995 and a Canon Digital Elph.  But when I saw the Olympus, I was hooked.  I went home, read up on its features, and bought it the same day.

And what features convinced me?  The 10X optical zoom is unparalleled in a camera of the C700's size and cost.  Serious photographers can override any automatic setting: aperture, shutter speed, focus, white balance, and emulated ISO setting.  And it works with Linux.

But nothing's perfect.  My biggest complaints are that I had to spend an extra $55 to buy 4 NiMH AA batteries and a 128MB SmartMedia card.  The bundled 8MB card only stores 16 pictures at the default settings.  Some people may also lament the 2.11 megapixel CCD; many cameras in this price range now have 3.3 mp.

.....Some more details.....

This camera is great for anyone from a novice up to a serious amateur.  Novices can use the camera as a simple point-and-shoot and get reasonably good pictures.  Serious hobbyists can tinker with the lighting, focus, and white balance and get more interesting pictures in a variety of settings.  This is a "having your cake and eating it, too" situation.  If you need to take a picture quickly, just hit the shutter button.  If you want to get artistic or shoot in unusual lighting, everything's adjustable.

The user interface makes everything easy to get to.  Changing the aperture and shutter speed can be done with one button.  Changing the focus takes two.  Everything else is in a well laid-out two-level menu.  You can pick three menu settings for top-level access.

The camera takes AA batteries, giving me the choice of 
Lithium (included), rechargeable, or alkaline in a pinch.  I have two sets of rechargeables that I rotate; each lasts several days of normal use.

The C700 acts as a "USB mass storage" device, which means that it can run with any USB-capable OS, including Win98+, MacOS, and Linux.  The computer treats the camera as an external hard disk and can download 8 MB (16-25 pictures) in about 8 seconds.

I would very strongly recommend this camera to anyone who wants the flexibility of a digital SLR in a $400, 11-oz package.

One caveat: many of the cheaper vendors are selling either imported grey-market cameras (which have no warranty and may not have English-language menus) or are selling "bare" cameras without software, cables, batteries, or the 8MB smart card.  Make sure you buy the U.S. retail box.
