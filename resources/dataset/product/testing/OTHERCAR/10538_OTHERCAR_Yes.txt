            When we learned we were expecting child #2 we knew my Plymouth Sundance would have to go. It was a compact car and a two door.  Getting two car seats in the back would be next to impossible.  So off we went in search of a larger vehicle, a mom-mobile if you will!  We wanted a minivan for the space and convenience. With so many larger vehicles on the roads I no longer felt very safe with something small.

  We shopped around and found a 96 Plymouth Voyager Rallye with only 35,000 miles. It was priced at 15,400 and had every feature imaginable. It has power windows, door locks, anti lock brakes, air conditioning, cruise control, alloy wheels, roof rack, privacy glass, AM/FM/Cassette/CD Player, driver side sliding door, room for 7,keyless entry and the best of all-2 built in car seats! 

I just think the car seats are the greatest feature! No more fussing with trying to get the car seat installed correctly. You just fold down the cushions on the first row of seats and there are 2 built in car seats.  Now with the infant you will still need to install one.  These seats are for children from 22-40 lbs.  My toddler uses it and it is so quick and easy to get her in and out of the car. If we are going somewhere with just adults we just fold it up and they have plenty of room to sit too. This to me is the best part of the van.  The driver side sliding door is great too! It is nice to have the access to the rear of the van from both sides, especially when you have to get two children out from there!

We have had the van for one year now with no maintenance problems aside from needing new tires. It runs very smoothly and handles well.  We live in an area where it snows a lot in winter and I feel very safe and comfortable driving this in that type of weather. We took it on vacation last year and we were able to pack so much more than if we had a car.  The space is great and the seats can be folded down or even removed for more space.

I would recommend this vehicle for someone with a growing family who is looking for something safe, roomy and dependable.
