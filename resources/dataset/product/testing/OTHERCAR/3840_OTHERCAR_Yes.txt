  I remember the days in 1997 when me and my dad were looking for a car. We recently had to ditch a leased Grand Cherokee because it decided to have an early heart attack. I wanted something unique, sleek, and not seen every block or so on the street ( like the Ford Explorer). Suddenly one day I saw a perfect SUV drive past me on the street. I had no idea what it was, but it captured me. I didn't see the same car again for another week, but when i did, i was hooked. The Car i saw was a 97 Mitsubishi Montero Sport. 
  
    All of a sudden i was at the Mitsubishi dealership near my house about to test drive the vehicle. As soon as i sat in the driver's seat, i felt in control. It was the most quiet and smooth ride on 12 mile ( known for it's rugged concrete terrain (potholes). 

   Yup, we bought it, for about $30,000, we bought a fully loaded 1997 Mitsubishi Montero Sport XLS 4WD. The options we got were enormous. We got the Triple Diamond Care Service, along with 75,000 miles warranty on all machine parts, including the engine. Infinity Audio Sytem, in dash CD player (i prefer in dash to 6 disc, but that option is available too). A huge moonroof also came with the package. Leather seats were standard on the XLS too. It was loaded, and as i started to drive it around, people were shocked that i got it for only $30,000 ( Considering the Toyota 4 runner was about $37,000 fully loaded). THe handling on the car is awesome. It is made with the Mistubishi 3000 GT engine, and is built to drive like a car.

 If anyone remembers the Snow Blizzard in the Detroit Area, you will know what i'm talking about. We had been out of town for 3 weeks, and left my baby ( the Montero Sport) in the airport parking lot for weeks. We were the last plane to land that day becuase the snow fall was so heavy. When we got to the car, it was totally covered with snow. Of course, there was no problem starting the car, it started to purr quietly as the defrosters were put on high. I realized that this wasn't going to be an easy ride home. There were atleast 4 inches of snow on every street. No one could drive, it was hell. I dropped the gear to the 4wd LOW setting, and pressed the All Terrain mode button. I started to drive, and on the way home, i could swear i passed 40 SUV's that were just staring at my car, surprised that it wasn't fishtailing from left to right. The car just dug into the snow the whole ride home. When we got home we were shocked, and we knew that we bought the best SUV out there.     
 
  Right now i have about 40,000 miles on my Montero Sport. In these 40,000 miles, i have visited for 5 oil changes, (  a couple of them were special oil changes that lasted for 10,000 miles. No other problems occured, to my surprise. I drive like i'm racing through the Sahara, and still nothing is wrong with my vehicle. I have changed my Yokohoma tires only once. To my projection, this car will last me well over 100,000 miles, and i have every intention of doing so. 

 Recently i added a brush gaurd to the front of my car that just adds to it's sleek and unique look. I intend to do more to the car, because i want to keep it unique, the popularity of the car is going up. Thats good though, right?
