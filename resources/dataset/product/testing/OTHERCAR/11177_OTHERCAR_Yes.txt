            We bought a 1995 previa when I was pregnant with our third child.  We realized that 5 people don't fit in a corolla comfortably for long trips.  Ours is a LE with a super charger and all track.  The Super Charger helps it run more smoothly when under a load.  We also test drove the van with out the super charger and it seemed a little sluggish when taxed.  

The all track has also been a wonderful feature when dealing with Iowa winter weather.  While it is a rear wheel drive vehicle I have never had the sliding problems in the snow that usually accompany the rear wheel drive vehicles.  I believe that the all trac has a lot to do with that.

It did take some getting used to where the from of the van is.  We found that if you feel like you could kick the car in front of you there is about 4 inches between you and that car.  Because it is a mid-engine vehicle the cornering is also a little different you sit closer to the front wheels which takes some time to  know there the wheels are.

The model we have has captains chairs in the center and because there is quite an age range between our children this gives them each there own space, and cup holders.

The rear air is also a great feature especially when the windows are tinted in the back.  They aren't as warm as you are when you are sitting in the front.  The rear heat is great instead of having to wait for the heat to woft back from the front.  

The van handles very similar to the other Toyota's that we own.  Because it is bigger it doesn't corner quite as tightly as the Corollas.

This is a great vehicle for those who are transporting the team whether it is kids or adults there is ample room for comfortable seating for 7.  The space behind the back seats is large enough to hold all the gear too. 
While it may not be your least expensive option I feel it is the best.  When we replace our van we will look into another Toyota van.
