            Recently got rear ended and had to have my AUDI A6 in the shop for body work. Got a rental Lincoln Town Car to replace my A6. 

PROS: As I said in the title. Large car, almost too large. But I like big cars. The ride is smooth and silent. And that height adjustment for the pedals is a great idea. And that's it...

CONS: This car feels like a hovercraft. Cant fell the road at all, Suspension is too soft. So soft it is dangerous. The handling is nothing but a joke. It wobbles all over the road and at the least bit of pressure in gas pedal you got this bad boy in terrible oversteer. I found this to be the worse rear wheel drive car I ever drove. My 99 Camaro does better with 235mm tires. This car cannot communicate with the road if there is any evidence of rain. Scary... And then there is the ergonomics. I am 6'2'' and in order to reach half of the radio controls I have to move my whole body off the seat while driving. The dash is straight and plastcs are CHEAP. The buttons make a "click" sound like the ones you can buy at the Radio Shack. The inside of this car is a joke... And then there is the 14MPG gas mileage around town. 

CONCLUSION: This is nothing but a BIG FORD TEMPO with a V8. This is NOT A LUXURY CAR. This is a taxy cab for 40 grand. Do yourself a favor and get a Lincoln LS, a BMW, an AUDI or a MERCEDES. (I dont like Japanese cars but Lexus makes good cars too). And as for FORD they should be ashamed... This car is a joke. I cant wait to get my A6 back.
