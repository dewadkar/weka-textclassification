            Absolutely great purchase!  We have had this camera for about 6 weeks and are ecstatic with it.  

We have taken several hundred pictures (all with the batteries that came with the camera).  I spent considerable time doing internet research on digital cameras and did not make a final decision until I went to the store and physically compared this camera with similarly priced Nikon and Canon models.  The Olympus D-490 Zoom had equal or better features compared to the other cameras.  In addition, I like the size and weight of this camera...some of the other cameras I looked at were too light for me...The Olympus is not heavy but does feel good in your hand.  

The picture quality has been outstanding.  I've printed my pictures out on my ink-jet printer and friends can't tell that it was from a digital camera.  

I would recommend getting a SanDisk Flashpath floppy disk to transfer pictures to your computer.  The camera comes with a serial connection which is simply too slow and uses battery power.  Also, I'd recommend getting another SmartMedia card or cards if you will be taking alot of pictures prior to downloading to your computer.<br><br>
