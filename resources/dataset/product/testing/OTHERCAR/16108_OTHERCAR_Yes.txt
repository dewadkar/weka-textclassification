            The ride in the Grand cannot compare with the Jeep Country 1995 which we own. The ride is smooth like a car not like a jeep.There is more room in the Grand in the back seat.It is easier to enter and exit the rearseat compared to our jeep.


Bad Point--Closing the driver's door once you get in if you forget to close the door when you get in.(very hard for a short person) it's along stretch.

           Blind spots using the inside rearveiw mirror. Maybe a larger mirror would help. 


Good points--All the controls glow at night so that you can see them easily.

             Excellant heat and air control this year.<br><br>
