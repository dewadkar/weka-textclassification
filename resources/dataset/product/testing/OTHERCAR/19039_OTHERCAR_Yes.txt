            I checked quite a few options before settling on the Olympus Cameida 2020 Zoom camera.  My purpose for purchasing a digital camera was for ease and flexibility in taking photos I need when I need them.  I publish a newsletter, and digital photography means saving a heck of a lot of time having film developed, picking it up, scanning it, and then finally manipulating the images for layouts.  With digital, I can take the photo I need and transfer as much as a single image to the computer, as needed.

I had been a long time Minolta user in traditional film photography, but my research for going digital brought me an awareness of the excellent optics available from Olympus.  

Digital quality depends on several factors: the number of pixels the camera uses to create a photograph (resolution/sharpness), the depth of color and shading possible (the higher the bits of color capture the better), and the quality of the optics (clarity and sharpness, and level of distortion).  The Olympus 2020 Zoom boasts 2.1 megapixels, yielding high quality photos.  The 24 bit color provides realistic blends, with nice detail, even in the shadows.  And the lens is of high quality, resulting in excellent detail and sharpness.  

There is a zoom lens with a fingertip control.  The auto focus is very accurate, and color balance is excellent.


I found that the Olympus 2020 Zoom provided an outstanding balance of optical acuity, features, and price.  

Compared with other digital cameras, I noticed in comparative images, that I could see individual strands of hair, or similar details with the 2020 that I just didn't see in some other cameras in the price range.  

The ability to change the quality of the image from standard to very high allows you to balance your needs for resolution against image storage capacity.  The higher the resolution, the less photos you can store on the SmartMedia card. But for many applications, lower resolutions reproduce very well, and allow more photos to be stored on a card.   Larger capacity cards are available that permit more than 50 high quality photos to be stored, and switching cards is a snap!  They are tiny, easy to carry, easy to use.  Only drawback is that the 8MB card that comes with this camera is woefully low capacity.  I recommend buying one or more extra 32MB SmartMedia cards with your camera. 

The camera comes with software that allows you to &quot;weave&quot; together several shots to create panoramic photos, but this will only work with Olympus SmartMedia cards, which can cost slightly more than other makes of card.  The camera, however, does come with an Olympus card if you'd like to do wide landscape photos.  I have not used this feature.

I found that the instruction manual for the camera was a bit daunting, as there are quite a few options and settings, but you can get started pretty quickly, and if you just want to use the basic zoom and photograph, you can be up and running in minutes once you've juiced the batteries.  I think the manual, for all it's length, could provide more useful information than it does, and be a little more clearly organized and written.  But the relatively simple controls don't really require extensive instruction.

I had read quite a few pieces about the energy limitations of digital cameras because of the high power usage.  But my experience is that this camera goes for weeks on a single charge, taking and downloading some 120 or more photos.  The camera comes with rechargeable AA batteries and a charger.

I bought the optional floppy drive loading system, so I can put the image storage (SmartMedia) card into the ersatz floppy, and load the images directly into the computer.  While it's faster than loading directly from the camera, and saves camera battery life, it still takes a while to load images - and the floppy is only compatible with my Macintosh to the extend of downloading the, but not managing (deleting from the disk, for example) images through the desktop of the computer.

I find the camera easy to hold, small and light enough to carry conveniently, and pleasant to use - with controls logically placed and accessible.  I have been very happy with the photo output.  For me, this is a leap forward in photography from celluloid film and drugstore developing.  

While the camera can be set to take Black and White, or sepia toned photos, it's seems easier to do that using computer software than to change the setting on the camera.

This is an excellent camera for the semi-professional - practical, full of flexibility, and enjoyable to use.
