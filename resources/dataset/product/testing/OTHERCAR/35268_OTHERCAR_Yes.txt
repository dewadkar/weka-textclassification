            This is my third G series PowerShot digital camera. I owned the G2, G3 and now the G5. In addition to the increased megapixels from 4 to 5, there are only a few other changes from the G3. By the way, in case you're wondering why Canon skipped over the "G4", it's because those symbols translate into the word "die" in some Asian languages and Canon decided against naming one of their cameras the G4.<p>Some of the other changes to the G5 include increased zoom capacity to 16X, a dull black finish, a slightly better macro function and different packaged photo editing software.<p>There are several reviews on ePinions for the G5 that go into more technical detail, so I will not repeat what is already available to the reader here on this site. There is a great site: www.dpreview.com that will provide you with just about the most complete review on this camera that you will find anywhere. So for more in-depth information on this camera, I recommend that you visit this site.<p>My experience with the G2, G3 and now the G5 has made me a true Canon PowerShot G series fan. I will most likely buy the next version (G6?) when it comes out. In a nutshell, I can tell you that this is a marvelous camera for the digital novice or advanced user. Loaded with many features and yet easy to learn and use. More importantly, the photos it produces are extraordinary. There may be other cameras that can take better pictures, but unless you are a consummate perfectionist or professional, I doubt that you would discern the difference. And there are not many other cameras in this class and price range that will give you so many features and versatility.<p>Another consideration when shopping for a digital camera is the resale price when you are ready to trade up. I can equate this camera to the Toyota as far as depreciation. Each time I traded up a G series camera I got top dollar, which translated into very minimum additional cost to purchase the newer model.<p>As stated previously, this review is very general in nature and is meant to give you an overall view of the newest entry in the Canon PowerShot series. For more technical information, please see the site mentioned above or read more detailed reviews on ePinions. The bottom line is: if you are in the market for a digital camera and can spend $450. to $600., you will get a lot of camera for your money with the Canon PowerShot G5 and you will not be disappointed.
