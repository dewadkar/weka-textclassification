              We bought our 92 Safari XT two years ago used. We were a little concerned about how well it would hold up, the odometer was fast approaching 100,000 miles. 

  It has needed a few repairs since we bought it. During the initial detailing at the dealers they broke the switch for the rear air conditioner,which we did get them to replace since it worked when we test drove it. New tires were a given. The automatic seat adjuster broke. The cable for the locking gas cap broke (not the cable itself but the small black plastic piece that you pull to open it). I didn't really like were they put this particular piece of equipment, even when it was intact you still had to open the door to get to it and remove your seat belt to reach it. Not easily accessed. It has also needed front end work and the catalytic converter now needs replacement. These things though are minor considering its age. With a 100,000 miles of wear and tear, and that the vehicle was used as a road mechanics vehicle (lots of different people in and out). It has held up surprisingly well. My brother on having seen ours asked for a ride and then him and his wife went out and purchased one. Several of my husbands co-workers when he gave them a lift, commented on its handling and smoothness of driving. They also looked into purchasing one. (I do not know if any actually purchased any).

 We have three children and the rear air conditioner comes in very handy for long summer drives. The kids will actually have us turn it down it gets that cold back there. They love the side pockets for toys and books for our long trips and the room that it provides. We have the 8 seating. Two front buckets and two bench seats. We also have the rear side by side doors. Which is great for loading things in. They also have a great feature that allows you to unhook them and swing them almost flush with each side of the vehicle (for putting large objects in). We have removed the rear bucket for taking the kids bikes to grandmom's and still fit us all comfortable. I've never had to worry about whether a purchase would fit.Anything will fit in this van or on top of it. We also have the top rack for luggage or what have you and it came in handy when we purchased the kids bunk beds. Tied down and safe, no worries. 

  The sliding door has the locked open feature. Which is great for making sure everyone gets out safely without fighting a moving door. Both front seats have automatic locks. You push the button down and all the doors lock. This feature works well when you are taking everyone out and as the sliding door is opened the driver gets out pushes the button down and then closes the door and walks around to the sliding door, everyone exits, you close the sliding door, count to 5 and it locks automatically. This feature has saved us much time. No need to take the key out again to lock it. The only down side to this is with age this does not seem to hold up. The sliding door still works as its suppose to but the rear side by side doors do not always lock when you push the button down now. Although the unlocking feature still works fine.

 I like the stereo in this model as well with separate adjustments for front and rear speakers. If my husband and I wish to talk and the kids want the radio we can put the sound to the back and not have to listen as well or vice versa.
 
  Another great feature on this model is the ability to leave the doors open and shut off the overhead lights. This is great during the summer when you just want to let the air circulate inside when you are visiting friends or relatives. Also on the dash you can turn on the overhead lights without searching for a switch, it is located within easy reach of the driver. The map lights in this are great, four mini lights, two for the bucket seats and two for the middle bench seat. This light set up has come in handy with little ones who are not quite tired on long night drives and who would like to have a little light. The small amount of light that it gives off is not enough to distract the driver. It also has two small storage bins located in the ceiling between the mini lights, I use these for storing cassettes. I have had them get stuck several times but managed each time to get the doors open again. The tapes had fallen over and jammed the door. 

  I like that I can put my children in through the side sliding door and then climb on up after them and after buckling them in I can still make it to my seat without a problem and without leaving the vehicle. 
  This vehicle is great for large families or growing families. I love the fact that when my sister and I plan an outing we can all go together in one vehicle. She has three children also. I never have to worry if I'll be able to seat everyone. Booster seats fit great in the center of each bench seat or with the metal adapter that comes with them on the shoulder harness side seats.

  With age our bench seats also move slightly in turns. Not much but they don't lock fully into given position. So if you are seated in one and the driver takes a sharp turn you do feel the movement forward or backward slightly.

  I started out thinking I wanted everyone to know how great this vehicle was. I am very happy with my van. I think it handles great and considering the age and mileage that the repairs needed are within expectable ranges. But after writing this and putting it into words. I would have to say if your looking for a good used van, maybe you should look elsewhere. This vehicle doesn't seem to hold up with wear and tear. There are a few things I left out. Like that one of the windows now leaks and that the upholstering on the back of the last bench is coming off. Normal items of wear and tear, but if your looking for a vehicle that won't cost you and arm and a leg to maintain over the long haul. This vehicle isn't a used car buyers dream.

 I would purchase this vehicle new, but on having owned one used I would not purchase it used again.<br><br>
