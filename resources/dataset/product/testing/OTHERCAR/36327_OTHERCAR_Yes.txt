            In over 35 years of driving I finally found myself in a situation where a brand new car made sense. An employer touting the GM Supplier pricing arrangement, GM's incessant $2002 overdrive commercials, and my seven years of old GM card earnings got the calculator buttons working overtime. After careful consideration of the GM line-up I was left with one car to fit my needs in value and simplicity, the base model Camaro. The base model is well equipped, without bloat and includes air, full analog gauge package, a terrific CD player stereo system, four wheel disc brakes with ABS. The power from the 200 HP cast iron V6 is excellent, and the 3800 series II engine has been around a long time and is nearly bulletproof. The General also has had ten years to refine the current body style and my car is remarkably solid without any rattles or squeaks. If you remember the rear wheel drive cars the Camaro pleasantly takes you back in time with a 'seat of your pants' feeling while cornering. This car is fun to drive, you must consider getting the base five speed manual transmission and really drive this car, you will enjoy it.  The Camaro has composite (plastic) doors and front fenders, double sided galvanized sheet metal in all other important areas, and a stainless steel exhaust system, so rust and door dings should not be an issue here in the upper Midwest.  I have owned and driven many cars from Aurora to Studebaker, the Camaro in my opinion is one of a handful of cars left with a soul, it's 'Bad to the Bone' and that's a very good thing :-).
