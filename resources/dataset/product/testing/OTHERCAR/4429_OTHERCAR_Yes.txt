            I used to own a 1999 VW Jetta and I loved the car. Yet the Jetta lacked the options that we desired such as cruise, power windows, Monsoon stereo, etc. So we looked into trading our Jetta for another Jetta, but Golfs always seemed to attract me because of their sporty look. Having looked at Jetta's, the dealership did not have one that we wanted, but they did have a Golf that we both loved.

Although the Golf has the 2.0 L engine, it proves to be very spunky. The engine is very responsive as well as the transmission being very adaptive to my driving style. The transmission shifts rather smoothly as it the car smoothly handles through the tight corners. The interior is very comfortable as well as the seats that hug me very well. In other words, I feel very accommodated within the Golf with its outstanding Monsoon stereo and pleasing-to-the-eye lines of the interior of the not-so-cheap looking interior fixtures.

The downfalls of the Golf are very minimal. There is a blindspot on either side that you look when driving. The middle headrest in the back seat is in the way, so it has to be taken out. The hatch seems to have to be shut with force in order to close. Lastly, although, the drink holders conveniently tuck away when they are not needed, it is in the way when trying to access the radio.

In conclusion, the Golf is an outstanding vehicle and I would recommend it to anyone. It is very fun to drive and it often turns a few heads. It is a feminine car, being that mine is cherry red. My wife loves it to pieces and I am sure to purchase another VW when this one dies.
