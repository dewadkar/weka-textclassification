            I was hesitant about getting a car when I began searching for my first vehicle.  I knew it would have to be something that I would drive for a while so I had to be careful with what I chose.  No matter what dealership I would go to the Honda Civic would always catch my eye.  After careful consideration I finally purchased a Honda Civic and am very glad that I did.  The car is like a dream packed into a box on wheels.  It has the best handling and comfort that i have felt in any vehicle of its size.  Every part of the interior feels as if it were hand crafted to fit your comfort style.  The looks compliment the comfort and I get many great comments about my good decision.  I would highly recommend anyone get a Honda Civic.<br><br>
