            In August of 1997, my beloved car completely DIED on me.  I needed a new one.  I had no credit, I had a job.  I went to the nearest dealership I trusted, and began to walk around the lot.  I was approached by someone I knew whom didn't work at the dealership, but detailed the cars in his shop for them.  He asked what I was doing, I told him I needed a car.  He said, &quot;You want a good car?  you want a cheap car?  Lets go inside&quot;  he introduced me to a salesman and the next thing I knew I was being shown a Kia.  

I had never HEARD of Kia before.  In the next hour or so, I learned that they had been in the States for several years, but only down South, and out West.  They had received the first shipment up North that very morning!  

I was not too picky, I told him I wanted a 4 door car, with a trunk, that ran.  The salesman grabbed some plates and said, &quot;Lets go for a ride&quot;.  He opened the door of a 4 door LS sedan, He had to take the plastic off of the seats, it was so &quot;NEW&quot;.  It kind of scared me.  I'd never owned a new car before.  

The car handled wonderfully!  I couldn't feel the railroad tracks as I drove over them.  It steered with great ease.  The engine ran so quietly.  The air conditioner worked.  I drove a little bit more, and then we went back to the showroom.  We began to discuss financing.  I informed the sales man I had no credit.  He confirmed that, but I was pretty sure I could get my mother to co - sign for me.  

He gave me the keys, and a set of dealer plates, and said, &quot;Go see what your Mom thinks of your new car.&quot;  WOW!  So off I went.  Less than an hour later we were signing the papers.  

Now 30 months later, there are a few things that bug me about the car. I like to open my windows, and if it is raining, it rains right into the door pockets. There is no factory installed clock, the floor carpeting velcros in, and the glovebox, and the vinyl visors rattle slightly. And 5 people really don't fit comfortably. The seats are not the most comfortable on long distance drives, but one should get out and walk every couple hours anyway.  

There have been no major visits to the shop, It gets excellent mileage, I was backed into twice, and my car received no damage.  I have since heard these cars referred to as &quot;Throw away cars&quot; - just drive them until they die, and get a new one.  I change my oil, I get it tuned up, I have the tires rotated, it runs fine.  The heat, air, and defroster work and it gets where I need to go.
