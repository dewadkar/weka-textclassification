            I was choosing between this camera and the Canon S200.  I chose the 490Z mainly by listening to user opinions on message boards and review sites (magazine reviews aren't always accurate).  I'm glad I did because this is an excellent camera for a beginner user like me.  The sliding built in case is another reason I purchased it...

Pros
The camera offers 3X optical zoom, and another 2.5 digital, for up to 7.5 total zoom.  The picture quality is excellent, with no apparent jagged edges.  The software that it comes with, the Olympus Camedia software, offers basic preset image correction features for beginners (I rarely had to use Photoshop because the pictures came out great).  Printouts on my Epson Photo 750 came out great.  Battery life is good so far; it operates on 4AA batteries, which are easy to find and relatively inexpensive.
If offers different image qualities, same as most cameras.  But the 490 allows you to save in uncompressed format also (don't quote me, but few cameras have this feature).


Cons
Olympus has decided only to provide an 8 MB smartmedia card.  That's a little skimpy considering the fact that with such a nice camera, you'd want to keep taking pictures.
The serial port connection is WAY WAY WAY too slow, sucking battery.  There is no USB, so you'd be better off picking up a smartmedia card reader.  You'll end up saving money in batteries in the long run.
I am a little fearful of breaking two parts on the camera: the flash, and the telescoping lens.  The flash is attached by two tiny plastic arms... so far they're fine, but time will tell.  Also, to close the camera, you have to slide the case halfway, wait for the lens to retract, then close fully.  This makes me think that I am hitting the lens every time.


Don't get me wrong, its a great camera.  But to get the most out of it, you have to spend a little more.  ($40-50 for a smartmedia card reader, $60 for an additional 32 MB smartmedia card, rechargeable batteries are another $35)
