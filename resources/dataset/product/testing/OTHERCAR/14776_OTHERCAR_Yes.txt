            Although we did not buy this vehicle new(we bought it used as a lease return) we couldn't be happier with it!  I was nervous at first to drive such a big truck, but I have made the transition with no problems! I can even get it into my tiny one car garage! We initially began looking at trucks because I felt it would be easier to get my daughter in and out out the back seat- boy was I right!  I would never go back to a car and can't wait to sell my Camry to get another SUV!

One downside, so far is the the lack of the re-circulated air option(most American cars don't have this), which means that even if you have the heat on, if the car ahead of you is emitting bad fumes, it goes right into your car!  The other downside is that it get horrible gas mileage, which is only a problem now with gas prices so high.  Please be sure to get a demonstration of how to change a flat- it is difficult if you have no idea how to get the tire down!<br><br>
