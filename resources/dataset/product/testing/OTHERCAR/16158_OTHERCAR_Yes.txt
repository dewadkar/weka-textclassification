            Anyone interested in purchasing a Dodge Avenger must first consider the fact that they will now have to buy a used model. In 2001, Dodge decided to discontinue the Avenger and substitute it with their opinion of a sleeker Stratus Coupe...much to the dismay of many Avenger fans-this change came about suddenly and was left with a lot of unanswered questions. Another viewpoint that one must consider before purchasing this model is mileage-you do not want to buy a car that will deteriorate under the hood faster than the body which seems to be as close to perfection as the human eye can see. Also, be watchful of the dealership that you trust-and do not allow yourself to be "taken" just because of the outside body and the fact that it is a "sports car." Insurance is not a major concern for many people in the buying group due to the fact that even though an Avenger is a sports car-it is not a compact car so therefore, unless the buyer has poor driving reflections with their insurance-this car should be a dream both to drive and to insure. 
The inside of an Avenger is a dream-whether it be leather trim, vinyl, or upholstered-it shares a taste for everyone. Most ES models come equipped with 7 surround sound speakers and both a cassette and compact disc player. The seats in most of this models are also electronic for easy in and out for backseat passengers. Also, speaking of back seat riders, the Avenger features much leg and head room for every size and shape and is easily adjustable for a car seat to fit the little ones. 
The outside of the Avenger is very sleek with side moldings on many models, a rear spoiler and fog lights...many colors are available and graphics displayed on these types of cars are fantastic.
