            With a new baby, my Honda Prelude didn't cut it anymore (couldn't even fit the car seat). No wagon handles like a little sports car, but this car is really a pleasure to drive.
Once you remember where the key goes (like all Saabs, it's down next to your seat like in an airplane) and start driving, you realize it really has terrific handling and acceleration, and a great, smooth ride.
The car is still fairly new, so I can't say much about reliability (although so far, it's been perfect). There's plenty of space in the back and those of us with babies or young children will appreciate the seat belts that make putting in a car seat a breeze.
I got the ventilated seats (with some difficulty, since I hear they're not generally available in the northern parts of the country), and I loved them during the hot summer. (North or not, NY City is hot in July.)<br><br>
