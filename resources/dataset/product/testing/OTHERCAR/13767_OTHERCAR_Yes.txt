            I bought this truck in late 1998 before the '99 model year was released and got a great deal on it. My friend bought a 1997 Dodge Ram Club Cab 4x4 almost 2 years prior and has loved it to death. It drives great and the design looks even better. I was looking more for comfort and ride quality in a truck and this one met and exceeded my expectations. 

I love the overall body design. Its very sleek and stylish and allows for many additions to even further make it look even better. The engine is very responsive and quick to accelerate and is very quiet at highway speeds. The interior is quite roomy up front with dual overhead lamps and a center console storage box and armrest. The Quad Cab is great for easier access to storage and to get those little things out that we all throw over our shoulder into the backseat from time to time. Theres really nothing that I don't like about it. This truck is the best investment I've made so far and hope it keeps on truckin' so to speak.

The price range sometimes is a little high depending on the dealer but a new model year should run anywhere between 23,000 and 26,000 for a 2WD and upwards of 30,000 dollars for the fully equipped 4 wheel drive vehicle. Either may cost a good amount but they won't dissappoint. Mine sure hasn't.<br><br>
