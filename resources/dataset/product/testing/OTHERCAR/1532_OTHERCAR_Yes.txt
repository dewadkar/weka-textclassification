            I loved my Saturn!!  I bought my Saturn SL2 in 1996 and it was love at first test drive.  Everything about it was just great.  It got great gas mileage was comfortable to ride in and fun to drive.  I made the biggest mistake when I thought I needed more room for my kids and got a minivan.  I see my Saturn around town every now and again and have grown to miss it very much. 
A Saturn is a good car for just about anybody.  I especially think it is good for single women because the maintenance is so easy to do on it.  
I know that the body was very durable.  My husband put it to the test once or twice.  
The only problem we every had with our Saturn was that the check engine light would come on and stay on and the dealership could never find anything wrong with it.  The replaced the emissions chip like 4 times but I don't believe that is what was wrong with the car.  
I just can't talk enough about Saturn.  They are great.  It is the best car I have ever owned.<br><br>
