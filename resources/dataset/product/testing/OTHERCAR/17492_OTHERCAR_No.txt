            My dream car was a Volvo, any type Volvo.  My husband and I couldn't afford a brand new one buy eyed a beautiful used 960 on the lot of Volvo Irvine.  We bought it for 16K with 65K miles on it.  1 1/2 years later we need to replace the engine.  It overheated one day and the rest is history.  We had all the scheduled maintenance required and  it still wasn't good enough.  The dealership isn't returning our calls and have written a complaint letter to the Corporate Headquarters.  After doing some research it seems this model is known for its expensive upkeep and BAD engines.  A useful wesbsite is brickboard.com.  It will recommend other models if you are really set on having a Volvo. Otherwise, stay away from the 960!
