               The Suzuki Swift hatchback is a delightful surprise for most owners.  If you expect every possible luxury feature and enough gadgets to fill the cockpit of a jet airliner, forget the Swift.  If you look outside the automotive mainstream, the Swift will do a number of jobs exceptionally well for you.
   First of all, this tiny hatchback is one of the lightest cars on the road.  Don't let that scare you off right away.  The car handles surprisingly well at highway speeds.  It's excellent aerodynamics make it less sensitive to cross winds than many much larger, heavier cars.  The 79 horsepower base version of the car gives nearly 50 mpg and acceptable performance.  The Geo Metro xfi (it's American twin) will give over 60 mpg from a 55 hp three cylinder.
   Swift lives up to it's name when you get the GT or GTi version.  This model comes with a 100hp, twin cam, 16 valve four cylinder, four wheel disc brakes, upgraded suspension and serious rubber on all four corners. The aero package is sharp, but won't tip off potential victims at stop light grand prixs. This model really flys.  It will embarrass many sport cars costing three times the price.
   The interior is well laid out and comfortable for my 6 foot 3 inch frame.  It will haul things in the hatchback I couldn't get into the trunk of my wife's '96 Impala. The car is a bit noisy at speeds.  You can almost hear the suspension work.  On the GTi, that's part of the fun.
   In summary, this car can be an absolute gas miser or a road rocket.  It's reliable and cheap to maintain.  It is cheaper to buy new than most two year old compacts. Most of all it's just plain fun to drive.  Why Suzuki doesn't revive the GTi and shout if from the rooftops is a mystery to me.  This car deserves to be a cult classic.  If you spot a used GTi, grab it quickly before everyone finds out.<br><br>
