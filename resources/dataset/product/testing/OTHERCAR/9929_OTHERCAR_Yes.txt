            I inherited this car from the wife � I don�t think too many males have bought either the MX-6 or a Celica. In spite of the �chick car� reputation, I have been pretty happy with it ever since I began driving it as my main commuter vehicle.

The wife, back when she was the girlfriend, bought this car immediately after graduating college. I lobbied against it, because I just knew it would be a lame car. It was a standard, it was too expensive, there was no back seat, and why don�t you get something with 4 doors? Don�t you think it is time to be practical? 

Well, I am glad she didn�t listen, because the thing is still fun as hell to drive and I haul @ss all over Dallas in it. Just yesterday on I-35, some semi was on fire and both southbound lanes were stopped. I whipped the thing around, crossed the median, and went from 0 to 65 mph in about 10 seconds, endangering myself and countless others, but my point is I was able to get up to cruising speed quickly, and this in a car that has 160K miles on it.

The steering and handling is great � still tight after all my abuse. There are the usual blindspots that you would associate with a low-seated sports car, but the actual experience of driving the car is still good. Mine is the 4-cylinder, and I can�t imagine the v-6 being any faster (I suppose it has to be, though). 

It still looks good, too. The two or three times a year I wash it, it still evokes a small amount of pride in having an aesthetically pleasing car. The curves are slightly (SLIGHTLY) reminiscent of the Mach Five and the white color helps complete the allusion.

The trunk is HUGE for a car like this. I am still shocked how much junk I can stuff in there. I have put amplifiers, guitars, loads of laundry, giant Christmas gifts and other big items in there, and when you put the back seat down, the trunk is bigger still.

What I don�t like � and it is a short list:

(1) The buttons on the dash to the right and left of the steering wheel (hazards, cruise control, etc.) can�t be seen without ducking your head. Is this because I am a dude in a chick�s car?

(2) Whistling windows � I heard they corrected this in later models, but it can be pretty annoying at highway speed.

(3) The backseat is ridiculous � I have been in the backseat about 3 times in my life due to inebriation (everyone should ride in the back seat of their own car every now and then � it gives a new perspective) and it is so small, I don�t know why it is even there. We took our baby home from the hospital in this car, and even he complained that his knees were in his eyes.

(4) The glove compartment has stopped latching, which means the light will come on all of a sudden as it opens partially. I have wondered if this poses a battery threat.

I would recommend this car for sorority girls and cheerleaders � I think a �GO CHI-O!!� bumper sticker would look right at home on the back window.  It is a good car for anyone, though, and I have never been unhappy with it. Try to get it from the original owner if you can. I think a 93 without a sunroof, V6 or spoiler (i.e., one like mine) can be had for 3-4K.
