            I rode in this car, liked the appearance, liked the ride, and thought the gadgets were cool, so,  I bought it.  
I have had it just one month now.  So far the repairs are as follows
Water Pump---(remanufactured)---$450installed
Brakesx4----(Cant turn BMW rotors)----$850dealer
Ignition switch----------------------$550
---and the dash is starting to buckle slightly-am not going to replace it.
All in all, the car is very nice to drive. When it works, it is very smooth. The AC cools great, but the set it and forget it temp. settings are ridiculous--they don't even remotely function correctly.   I bought this thing from a friend in Florida. I live in Arizona.  He cautioned me that the car can be expensive to fix.  He had the car serviced at the BMW dealership in Naples.  They never did much of the Service updates (recalls) that were supposed to be done... poor job for a service oriented brand.  The first day that I got it to Phoenix the waterpump went.  That introduced me to the Phoenix dealer. Chapman BMW (in phoenix) notified me that the car needed the updates and did them at no charge to me as well as give me a loaner. Really great people over there-highly recommended. 
       I have a love/hate relationship with this car.  My previous vehicle was a Toyota pickup 4x4, that I had for 6 years, and already the BMW has cost me much more in 1 month of maintenence than my Toyota did in 72x that long.  That ticks me off.
   I always got the impression that BMW was top of the line, but, BMW uses its fair share of cheap parts.  I notice lots of plastic.  The fake leather seats are a good example.  They are listed in the owners manual as "leather*" which they are not.  The flip side of this is that the thing accelerates well, and handles very well.  I like the on board computer as well.
          With what I know now, I would be very hesitant to ever buy a BMW again.  The fit and finish of OTHER cars is as good or better for thousands less.  The reliability certainly is questionable. Even the 2002 loaner I had, the sunroof jammed on me.  You dont see that kind of stuff out of a Toyota.   My friend that I bought this car from had also put a transmission in it.  It kinda reminds me of an MG.  You love to drive it, but, you know it is gonna break really, really soon.  Except the parts for this car are REALLY expensive.  You just hope you make it to your destination.
As for my friend----he tried to give me fair warning and had the car inspected at the Naples, FLA BMW dealership.  They gave it a passing review.  I dont even think they looked at it.  Chapman told me my brakes were almost gone when I got to Phoenix.  That was on their no charge look over of the car.
