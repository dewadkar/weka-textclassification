            I have used several digital cameras and love the features on my new Mavica. It is easy to use and the battery lasts extremely well and is rechargeable which means less damage to the environment.  It is extremely convenient to use the 3.5 disks for storage  and i no longer am tied to my computer by a download leash.  If the cameras full in the field, i can change disks and keep going.

I have been using the camera to gather outdoors pictures mainly up to this point in order to use the pictures to build web sites for clients.  In the world of tourism, the adage of a picture is worth a thousand words is an understatement.  When this Mavica FD73 is on the job, i can take anything from beautiful sunsets/sunrises to a small owl sitting in the headlight of my car on a dark pre-dawn with equal ease.  To take a picture of a hunter standing in his blind before the sunrise silhouetted against a beautiful fall morning sunrise and to know that picture is indeed centered, saved, and processed instantly makes any owner smile.

When 1000 geese fly overhead the 10x zoom draws them right in to super pictures when they're far beyond the reach of many other cameras.  With the ten times zoom i finally have pictures of geese not specks.  Real life size moose instead of a black spot in the distant field.  The zoom is easy to use and easy to see in the window how using it affects the pictures.

I recommend the Mavica to anyone who travels and wishes to record their holidays on a medium that can be purchased cheaply anywhere, to web site builders, and to outdoorsmen and sportsmen. <br><br>
