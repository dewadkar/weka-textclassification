            The 1992 Prelude is my first car. I was absolutely thrilled about it when i first got it, and I still am (It's been a year since i bought it). Every time I jump behind the steering wheel feels like heaven. Steering is very accurate (this baby can turn on a dime), and the car is very agile and responsive. The 2.0 liter 155 Bhp engine ( The Lebanese market version of the car uses the same engine as the 1993 JDM Accord SiR)propels the "lude" to 100Km/h in about 8 secs. The gas consumption is also quite fair. 
Beside the performance, the Prelude looks absolutely gorgeous. My friends just couldn't believe it was a 1992 until i showed them the papers! For an 11 year-old car, it still turns heads pretty well ( you can see tons of BMW's in Beirut but you don't see a 4th or 5th gen. Prelude everyday).
When it comes to the inconveniences, i really could not find much to talk about. Nevertheless, the Prelude can be considered as a high-maintenance ride: cornering a little too sharp can result in having a rattling front suspension; the engine and transmission can get you in trouble if you don't treat your car well ( I know I had to make $ 900 worth of repairs because of the previous owner's way of driving), but you can use it as your everyday car with absolutely no problem.
Another problem is that spare parts can be rare and expensive (but again I can only talk about the Lebanese market).
