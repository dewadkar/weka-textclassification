            	About 6 months ago I made the mistake that most young college students make at least ONCE in their lives...I bought a new car, and not a very good one at that.
	When I first bought this car, I loved it...it was my dream car (but soon not to be) It is black and has the Sun and Sound Package. The features that I like about the car are, It has a good sound system, It looks sharp, It surprisingly handles very well in the snow and is pretty good on gas.
	Despite these good qualities, the car has it's problems. For instance, it seems to be put together quite cheaply. I have had a problem with the door lock on the driver's side freezing solid, in which case I need to go unlock the passenger's side and reach over and unlock the driver's side manually. I have brought the car back to the dealer twice so far, and they have not been able to fix the problem.
	The next major problem I have with this car is space. It is very small inside and the trunk is tiny. I find it very hard to move my stuff from the dorms to home or vice versa...and I can just forget taking more the 2 friends for a ride at time..there just isn't enough room.
	Overall, I really regret buying this car. It has been pretty reliable, but a nusiance at the same time...to any potential buyers out there...really take a good look at what you are getting BEFORE you buy this car...you might just change your mind.
