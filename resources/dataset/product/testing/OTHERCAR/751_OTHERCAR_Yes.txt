            I've been driving my '94 Altima for almost three years now, and I love it. At almost 100,000 miles, it's needed no major repairs in the whole time I've owned it and it's never once failed to start for me.

For a single person, or even a small family, there's tons of room.  I lugged all my worldly goods to and from college in that car for four semesters, and it all always fit.  I'm told the back seat is comfortable - I've had three reasonably comfortable children in the back for short trips without a problem (I'm not sure how well that would go on a long trip, though).

The car gets great gas mileage - I can usually make 275 miles on a tank.  Between that and the almost total lack of repairs it's needed, this is the most economical car I've ever owned.

Also, as a short woman, this car is ideal.  I've driven very few other cars that would let me position the seat and wheel so well.  <br><br>
