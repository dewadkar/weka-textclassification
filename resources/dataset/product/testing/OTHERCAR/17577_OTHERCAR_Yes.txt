            A couple of years ago, my wife and I leased a 4 x 4 Toyota Tacoma. I had been wanting a truck for some time since all the guys in the Fire Department had them. I got my wish when I accidently slid into some ice and headed straight towards a telephone pole smashing our Toyota Tercel. My wife had no idea at the time that I was not going to get the car repaired until I showed up at her work with the truck and asked her what she thought. She told me &quot;I had trucks in my eyes.&quot; Sold!

It's come in very handy from our move into our new house, to helping friends, to transporting her to work in the snow. The only thing that I would change about the truck now is that manual shift. I should have gotten an automatic because my wife cannot drive a manual shift.

The truck is very good in the snow, but is a gas hog when it comes to miles. Fortunately enough it's only a pleasure vehicle in that aspect.<br><br>
