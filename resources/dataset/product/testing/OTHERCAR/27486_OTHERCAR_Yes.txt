            I bought my 1996 Mitsubishi Mirage S Coupe three months ago (with 80k mileage) and want to say about my experience with it. Saying in a few words this car is not bad, first of all I was surprised by low  fuel consumption, especially on a highway (27/40 mpg according to my estimations)... It handle quite well, even without power steering I feel comfortable to drive this car... Another positive point is that engine runs easily even after very cold winter nights... Heating system warms up very fast, what is definitely important during cold winter weather...Air conditioner works pretty well, and besides "On" and 'Off' position, its control switch has an intermediate regime which is excellent during low moisture and not very hot weather... Seats are quite comfortable for a short trips, but after 1-2 hours of driving I begin to feel discomfort in my back... If I'm not mistaken, backseat is unfoldable...Have to say, that there's a lack of space on rear seats if there're tall/big persons on front seats. I don't have any problems with brakes, they work good... Now about the most negative points... First of all I was upset with an absence of intermitting regime of windshield wipers (at least on my car), which is very handy during light rains... Then I found a noise level pretty high during run on some roads with higher roughness... Want to add that I really miss a tahometer for my 5 speed manual transmission... And finally this car is definitely not for a people who like sport style driving since it accelerates slowly (at least with my 1.5 engine)...
