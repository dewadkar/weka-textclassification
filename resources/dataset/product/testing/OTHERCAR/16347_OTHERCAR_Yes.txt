            I was given a HP C200 camera for my birthday last year. I was wanting a digital camera but had not purchased one yet so this was a nice suprise. 

I always buy HP printers and concider them the best you can buy. I was hoping that the camera would be of the same quality. I was not disappointed. Taking pictures with the C200 is a snap. Just open the lens cover, aim and shoot. There is three settings for picture resolution.  I use the middle one but it is not really necessary. The lowest setting is OK for sending pics over the Internet. 

A couple of things I don't like about this camera:

1. If you use the LCD Screen to aim  d shoot your pictures then get ready to spend a fortune on batteries. In this mode the batteries do not last long at all. We're talking minutes here not hours.

2. The pictures are stored on a memory card instead of a floppy disk. This makes unloading the camera more of a task. You have to hook up a  cable to your serial port and then to the camera (what do you expect for $300 bucks). 

All in all I believe that this camera is a good deal for the money. It will get you into digital photography without putting you in the poor house.
