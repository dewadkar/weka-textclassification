            I bought this car as a gift for my wife. The darn trouble is she almost never lets me drive it. In the two months we've had it, I've logged maybe 250 miles. Here's my impression from this brief test:

Once you get the tach above 6500 RPMs, this thing is a rocket! It can be a little sluggish at low RPMs or when cold. The real fun starts when you can downshift into a turn and really get on the gas. The big tires grip well for a while, then break free if you really goose it, the back end swings out, then back in again as you steer through the turn and use the gas to keep it in line. Just what a sports car should do! All the while the exhaust lets out a nice growl as you roll back up through the six-speed gearbox. 

The body and steering are incredibly tight. The short-throw shifter is fantastic and the ergonomics of the interior are typical Honda smoothness. The Start button is fun, but make sure you warn the valet parking attendants about it (we parked at one restaurant, came out two hours later and the car was still there - partly because they thought it was a cool car, but mostly because they couldn't figure out how to start it - I told the guy, so he must have been paying attention to something else when I mentioned it). 

The S2000 feels great on the highway but the real fun is any road that twists. The nose seems to go exactly where you point it into a turn and the rest is just smooth. The only two places I've taken it that were less than comfortable were a stretch of concrete freeway with lots of uneven seams, and a congested city street. The short length of the car makes it pitch fore and aft on the uneven highway. The city driving was only hard because I was dumb enough to think that I could drink a cup of coffee and talk on the phone while driving this car. Next time I'll skip Starbucks and bring the headset for my phone. It also doesn't help that Honda put the cupholder right behind the shifter knob.

With the top up, noise isn't too bad and you can enjoy the stereo at highway speeds. With the top down, you have to really crank the volume to hear the music. Forget about listening to NPR during your commute if you can travel at speed. This car would really benefit from an after-market speaker kit that mounts to the headrest/roll-bar. Other recommended accessories include the optional rear windscreen, seat-back pocket (typical of roadsters - very little storage space). Honda makes a nice cargo net for the trunk. Speaking of the trunk, it would appear large enough for one set of golf clubs, but I haven't had the chance to try it yet. I'd skip the titanium shifter knob - the standard aluminum one looks just fine. Its a shame Honda didn't engineer a glass window into the top. Speaking of the top, it works very easily and the windshield clasps are among the best I've seen on a convertible. Simple and easy to lock/unlock. 

Overall this car is fantastic. It is truly a sports car, not just a cute little convertible. Now if I can just figure out how to get my wife to let me drive it more often.<br><br>
