            My 1995 Mercury Villager has been great for travel space and everyday hauling the kids around. It rides a lot like a car. But maintenance expenses have been more than for any car I have owned. There is always something that needs attention. At this time the &quot;check engine light&quot; is always on, gas mileage is less than normal, it is frequently hard to start. One mechanic put an engine analyzer on it, results of this test indicate an anti knock sensor needs replaced to the tune 0f 422 dollars plus labor. He says that in working with autos for twenty years he's never had to replace this item. Guess I will bite the bullet at the dealership. Based on constant maintenance expenses, I don't think I'd buy another.<br><br>
