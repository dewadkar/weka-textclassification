            Let me start off by saying I loved my 93 Corrado. When I bought the car I traded in my 93 collectors edition Cabriolet and bought the car for $12,000 (1998). The car instantly made me smile. 

Everything inside the car was great and have the most comfortable seats i have ever had the chance to sit in. I drive on some long trips a couple of times a month(3-4 hours) and have never been tired of driving. Everytime I would pull up somewhere people would always ask "what kind of car is that?" These cars are fast and many people have no idea about them.

These cars have some problems that happen to all (most) of the Corrados and they are: Cracked foglight covers, Spoiler motor gives out, automatic seat belts stop working,and of course the dreaded moonroof. I can tell you that you might need to call VW headquarters when your moonroof goes out. and I will tell you why.  When my moonroof went on the blink it was a broken clip on one side.  OK most of you are thinking a broken clip what's the big deal 25-50 bucks and you are working again right? Wrong if you go to a VW dealership they will charge you $500 for the part and another 150 bucks to put it in. You read it right $500 for a plastic part and the deal is they make you buy a whole moonroof assembly just to get the one part. Now I will tell you that if you call VW headquarters and complain about the price that their dealship is trying to charge you they will call the dealership and tell them to sell the single piece. 

These cars are alot of fun but are alot of money to keep up. I think in one year I had spent well over $2000.00 just in upkeep.  My suggestion is to find a good mechanic (not VW dealership) and take the car to him only.
