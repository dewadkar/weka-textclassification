            The 98 Dodge Intrepid is a very stylish sleek looking car.  The V-6 engine has plenty of power and pick-up.  It is fun to drive this car especially if you must spend many hours in it. The ES interior is well appointed and the comfort level is excellent.  The radio, cassette, and CD player are excellent.  The speakers in the doors and rear are fine but the two front speakeres located next to the side windows sound tinny and rattle.  Bucket seats are comfortable and easily adjusted.  The one major flaw in the car is a nasty blind spot at 110 degrees from the front. Truck space is great and the real spare tire is a blessing.  Handling and ride are excellent.  The car is highly recommended.  I get 26+ mph on the highway and 17-18mph locally.<br><br>
