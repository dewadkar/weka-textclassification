            I bought this little Mercury Tracer from a great Used Car Dealer in South Fort Myers,Florida. I needed a car to get back and forth to work. I also needed a vehicle that would be reliable enough to drive without incident from Fort Myers to Cape Cod, Massachusetts.
The dealer suggested this little Tracer saying that from his knowledge of the car and others like it, he wouldn't be concerned at all about a long drive to Cape Cod.
He was right. It made the trip in early spring with no problems motor-wise. The only problem occurred when I hit New Jersey and a snow storm decided to blanket the remainder of the trip. The temperature had dropped so I turned on the heat. Unfortunately, the heater wasn't working very well, and the ride was pretty chilly.
However, I was pleased with the performance of my Tracer.
It is comfortable, and has no problems with constant speeds ranging from 65-75 highway traveling.

The car is a bit noisy, with rattles here and there, but considering it's age and the fact that it is just a basic vehicle with not too many frills, it's to be expected. 

I did have some problems with sticky valve lifters. A change in the weight of the oil seemed to fix that problem.

This would be a great little car for a new driver or anyone wanting a second car for traveling around town. The trunk is ample and the rear seats can fold down for extra storage. The radio leaves a lot to be desired but anyone can reinstall a different radio if that's a problem. 
All in all, I have to say I am pleased with the performance of this car. <br><br>
