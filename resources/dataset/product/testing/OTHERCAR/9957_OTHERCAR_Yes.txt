            Let me ask you a question. What does the average american do with his car?

Drive from work to home, to the thearter ect. 
And he/she gets there are nice american roads where the salt them if it snows and keep nice 30 mph speed limits.

What do most european drivers do?
Jump across the country at 120 Mph, drive 85 down roads half the size of ours, I guess thats why in most other countrys dirvers licenses are a lot harder to get.

But what does this say? that europeans demand more out of their car?
In a lot of cases yes, and the sweeds are no diffrent.
Saabs havent made a very big mark in the US yet, but the people who do drive them love them. There is a large and very devoted saab following and for a good reason. they just might be the best cars ever built.

My 84 900 turbo turns heads with speed and euro design(some of which people dont like, but I do).

It out runs Mustangs and Cameros but still has that trusty 4 cyl.

The new viggins are the next generation of blazingly fast 4 cyl. cars.
The viggin runs 14 sec. quarter mile stock, and a corvett runs it in around 13.5(LT 1 350 Cubic In V8) The Viggin is also just a hair less areodynamic than a Vett, and I mean a hair.

At about the same price the Viggen can still support a family has unbelivable wet/dry/snow traction. (take you vett our on the icy rodes of sweeden, and see how long it is before you buy a Saab. Leather, CD, SunRoof, Beautiful interiour and Exterior(remember this is a luxury car)
heated Seats, and Saabs just happen to be one of the safest cars in the World.

All in all If you are in the market for a car like this, just go drive one and i'm shure you will see why this car is 100% recomended on e-pinions.<br><br>
