              Roughly six months ago I grew tired of the puddles of antifreeze, built in squeaks, and loud, obnoxious exhaust system my 1992 Mazda Protege produced over time.  Not to mention the fact that it had a hundred billion miles on it, and I had no desire to test its limits.  Put it this way.  It was a great car for a recent parolee, but not for a college graduate. I did not commit to a life of student loan debt to drive a (as many a Springer guest would suggest) hoopty.  
  
My concerns when I began the unenviable task of searching for a new ride were numerous.  How many slimeball salesmen will I have to go through to find the car I like? Will I have my mother's luck with cars, and have to replace the engine in less than a year.  How many clams will it set me back each month? You get the picture. I am cursed with the tendency to think of the worst possible scenario. 
  
Although I was initially drawn to the new Mazda Protege, and found it similar to the Corolla in many ways, the name Toyota is much more synonymous with both reliability and affordability.  I decided, based on the price, its track record, an astounding miles per gallon ratio, and its futuristic yet not too flashy appearance, that the Corolla CE was the car for me.  You see, I'm not the kind of person who needs to make up for my sexual inadequacies by tooling around in a beefed up Viper, or a tough guy deluxe firebird.  
  
In the light of the fact that I would rather be eaten alive by Piranhas than spend my evenings and weekends bartering with shady salespeople over the price of a car, I decided to act swiftly.  After enduring the tactics of two different yet equally sleazy salesmen, I opted to buy my Corolla CE from the third dealership I patronized.
  
I purchased a four-door, with a 5-speed manual transmission, cruise control, A/C, and an AM/FM cassette for $13,900. Sure, there aren't many amenities, but I had no intentions of paying more than $15,000.  Little did I know, I could have paid less than $13,900 had I given the salesman a gram of coke. After my purchase, I noticed my Corolla on sale at just about every Toyota dealership in town.
  
Overall, I am quite content with the car. It gets extraordinary gas mileage. It rides smoothly with little to no engine noise.  A three year warranty comes with the purchase, but I could have gotten a five year warranty for $6.00 more a month.  The available space inside is suitable for an Al Pacino half pint like myself, but I envision problems in the comfort department for anyone six feet tall or more.  I have not had any mechanical problems.  My biggest gripe about the Corolla is that it lacks punch.  From a dead stop to 60 mph, I have time to read a book, balance my checkbook, and forge a Renoit painting.
