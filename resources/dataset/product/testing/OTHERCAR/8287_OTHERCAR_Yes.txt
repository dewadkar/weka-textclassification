            I recently bought a 2003 Toyota Corolla LE. I must be fair and say that I did not test drive either of the lower end models as I did not like the lack of features in the CE and I don't like sports cars, so the S was out in my book. However, I loved the feel and handling of the LE. 
I traded in a 1992 Nissan Stanza (Altima's Father for those that want the Nissan heritage), which was a very roomy, very comfortable mid-size sedan with a standard transmission. I found it very difficult to drive compacts with automatic transmission because they were cramped and did not shift at the right timing (as compared to my old car), thus causing me to instinctively go for the clutch and stick. I especially found this to be the case with the Nissan Sentra which had no room and very hard seats and the Civic which had a somewhat rough transmission; however, when I drove the new Corolla, I didn't have any of these problems. Granted this new car does not have the same pick-up as my old 2.4 litre engine, nor as much room. Even still, I find that it is relatively comparable to my old mid-size with comfortable seats and a roomy feel.  In fact, although it does not have the same pickup, it is not that noticeable in 99% of my situations. And trust me, living in Orlando, pick-up is required often.
Despite the fact that I had read reviews of this car having a noisier engine, I did not find this to be the case. My mother has a civic and I find it difficult to hear people talking in the front while I am in the back seat, as well, she has to turn up her music for it to be heard in the front. In my car, this is not the case. In fact, when I brought it home, my fiance wanted to look at the engine and asked me to turn it on - but the car was already on and he could not hear it!
Overall, this is a wonderful car with enough space for the standard user (even my 6' fiance is not cramped - It is fair to note, however, that the LE has height adjustable seats which make it roomier for taller people) and the LE's features are wonderful for the price. However, keep in mind that price is relative dependent on how long you want to spend in the dealership. We spent 7 hours there and moved an 18K price to 15,100. Do your research before you go to the dealership and this can be a very, very reasonably priced car.
Finally, my one beef with this car is the ABS situation. Toyota does not send cars with ABS to my area and to order one could take up to 4 months! It is the only feature that I wish I had in this car and one that is standard in the comparable Civic.
