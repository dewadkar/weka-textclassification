            The I-35 is a quantum leap forward from the very respectable I-30. We've had an '00 I-30 in the family for a year and, while we've enjoyed its comfort and surprisingly good road manners, it wasn't enough. The I-35 is. The styling is evolutionary but much more in tune with current styling values. The engine is simply marvelous, and the (alas - why not 5?) four speed automatic has been beefed up to handle the increased power. Brakes and suspension have been upgraded as well. I bought the base package because, frankly, I could not find a Sport without the damnable chrome wheels Infiniti was determined to ship for the first months of the model cycle. Still, in Houston the base suspension handily soaks up the various potholes and other road irregularities we have to live with. In the twisties, however, you'll wish you had the Sport package. The interior is simply lovely and the leather (lifted from the Q45) is to die for. The faux wood trim is much maligned, but there's the old saying that a good fake looks more perfect and often costs more. The 'J' gate shifter takes a little getting used to but the 'D' to '3' feature is very nifty indeed. The fit and finish of the car is perfect for the class. And don't forget the service! I looked seriously at the Acura 3.2 Sport, the Audi A4, and the Chrysler 300M. When I drove the I-35, I ceased looking and started buying.
