            My Parents decided to buy a new car a few years ago, and they were really interested in Saturn.  They went to the nearest Saturn dealer (Harrisburg) and looked around.  After that trip, and a test drive later, they decided to buy a '98 Saturn SL2.  It didn't have too many features other than what came standard, but it was a nice car.  This year, we decided to trade in that car while it was still under warranty, and we bought a '00 SL2.  

My parents were a little weary when we went down there to see how much money they would appraise out car for, but we were pleasantly surprised for it to be appraised for $11,000+, which we felt was a really good deal.  We've had the new Saturn for a few months now, and I've only gotten to drive it a few times, but I enjoyed it while I was driving!  I have an '89 Beretta GT with a V6, and I was surprised that my Mom's new car was just as quick if now quicker than my car.  Sure, I have 135k on my car, but it's still impressive.

I'm not saying that you can go out and race people at stoplights with the Saturn, but it's rather peppy for a four cylinder.  Another good thing about the car that it is a 5 speed manual transmission.  I seriously suggest that you get the 5 speed over the automatic.  It's very smooth, and you can get VERY good gas mileage with it.  My parents took a trip to Pittsburgh this Easter to visit relatives, and it's about 200 miles from where we live, and they averaged 38 mpg with the Saturn!  That's insane!

The newer Saturns are less noisey on the inside than older ones, but you can still hear the engine at high RPMs.  We haven't had any problems with the car at all, and are very pleased with it!  I'd suggest you look into Saturn for their service alone, not to mention their quality cars!<br><br>
