            Well lets start out with the fact that I own a 95 accent with 158k miles on it . So Hyundai has made me a believer in them . So I went down and looked at the Elantra to replace it and give the Accent to my son. First let me state that I am not a writer by trade so bare with me . I am a regular person trying to help out other regular people .

Well I test drove the Elantra and was very happy with the ride and comfort of the car . My test drive was a Elantra GLS with the standard features, including air , power windows, lock, mirrors and am/fm cass. The only add ons I was looking for was cruise , I have a 85 mile work commute. we looked around the lot and found one with this option and off we went . 

The ride was firm , almost alittle on the soft side but was nice .Handling was good . It seems to come out of turns good at regular city speeds close to flat with alittle body roll , but acceptable for the price of the car. 

The seat held my large frame well and had nice support , I am 5'11" and 250lbs . The seat had lumbar ,height and angle adjustments so finding a comfortable spot was easy .Hip room was good but alittle tight, at my size what can you expect in a compact . 

All the controls for the car are in reaching distance so when you learn where they are they are easy to find without looking away from the road . Cruise control is on the back of the steering wheel and are on the wheel it self so as you turn it moves with the wheel . I didn't like that part because of the way I drive the little handle hits my fingers as I come out of a turn and the wheel spins under my hand . 

Road noise was there but I was quit surprised at how well it was filtered out being that we are talking about a 12k car. At freeway speeds you are able to talk at a low tone of voice with no problems and you don't have to have the stereo turn up to get over it .  

Acceleration was very good , with the 5 speed it didn't have any problems getting out of its own way. The 140 hp 2L engine gives you very good power for the 2300lbs car . I didn't try the auto. It is a 4cyl engine and I didn't even think about an auto being scared that it wouldn't have the umphh that I would need with the size of my family, ummm we are all ummm large ya ya that it large :).. But thats me other might think different.

So after the test drive as we are pulling back into the lot I saw out of the corner of my eye a hatchback. The car I test drove wasn't the color I like so as we walked through the lot i walked over to the hatch back thinking it was an Accent .And to my surprise it was another Elantra called a GT. I asked to test drive this and the salesman ran inside to get keys . As I waited for his return i walked around the car and the more I looked the more I liked . It had 4 wheel disc and 15 alloy wheels . We got inside and off we went . the handling was much better than the GLS and felt more responsive. The ride was much firmer , you felt more of the road . Some that will be a turn off but I liked it . The leather seats held you nicely and adjusted the same as the GLS . The shifter throw seemed to me to be shorter than the gls and didn't feel as hmmm how can i put this .. soft. The gls shifting seemed like you were just moving a lever to get it into gear . The shifter on the GT seemed to have more resistance , you felt like you were changing gears . 

The GT comes with so many standard features the only options you can get are mats , mudflaps, cargo net, moonroof , abs and traction control . But to get the abs and traction control you HAVE to get the moonroof . I with they could split that , I am not a moonroof person. Other than those options everything else comes standard . So the standard GT is a VERY well equipped car . Standard is  AC, am/fm cd player. power windows , lock , heated power mirrors, cruise , keyless entry,int wipers front and back, vanity mirrors on both visors,center console with 2 compartments , 4 wheel disc brakes and driving lights. I am sure there are others but off the top of my head I can't think of any others .

PROS 
For the price ,in my mind , this is the best car on the market for bag for the buck. It has many features that we all want with very little downsides . This seems like a short list of pros but the car on a whole is almost to good to be true for the price.

CONS
Hyundai still have very low resale value so it is a car you buy to keep not for you people that want to a new car every 2 years . Position of the cruise control handle isn't in a good spot for people that let the wheel spin under there hands coming out of turns . For a real world GT it needs more than 140hp , but don't get me wrong it has plenty of hp . Lack of a power antenna. Will you give me a break this all seem so petty. But it is hard to find fault in this car in its price range . That's the key note IN ITS PRICE RANGE..

If you want a car with all the bells and whistles and you don't want a big car payment or don't have alot to spend ,then this might be the car for you . Don't take my word for it go test drive one . I own a Hyundai and have been very happy with it so i might be on the wrong side .Hope this helps
