            I bought this car because basically I've wanted one since I was a little kid. I always thought that they looked cool and I still love the styling. My car is a beautiful millano red. I love the handling of this car the pull of the engine and amazing smoothness of the shifting. When you throw this car into turns it just goes and follows those racing lines that are so illusive. I own the acura integra GSR and it only comes in manual transmission, and it also come with the 170hp vtec engine over the standard 140hp(I think) on the LS, GS, and RS models. So far I have had no problems with this car besides standard maintenance. If you like really quite rides this car is not for you. Because the shocks are relatively stiff compared to the Volvo 940 Turbo that I had driven before. But then there is close to no body roll when you throw it through corners and the brakes really stop the car FAST. The Engine revs all the way to 8,000 and it sounds like one of Honda's F1 or CART engines its great. I get looks at my car every day. Another plus about this car is that there are so many modifications for this car. I just recently put in a APEX'i dunk exhaust, Ground Control Coil overs, koni shocks, and eibach springs. The car now looks more aggressive and the sound from the exhaust sounds Italian with a great deep throaty purr ahh what a great car. The seats in front grip nice and are very comfortable. But I would not recommend getting this car if you plan to put 4 people in it. This car is really only meant to seat 2 people. Everything on the center console is placed at your finger tips. I wouldn't trade this car for any other in its class. Go out and test drive one you won't regret it. A side note that after I put in the Ground Control Coilovers, Koni Shocks, and Eibach Springs the ride has become much harsher and the interior rattles more than it use to so if you like the original ride I wouldn't change the suspenion if I were you unless you buy really soft springs. Still love the car though! Another bad point is that my car is really flashy now and cops love to pull this car over just to take a look... But I still recomend this car, maybe in a more subtle color. <br><br>
