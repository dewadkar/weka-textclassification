            On June 3 of this year, I bought a brand spanking new Mercury Cougar 2000.  The particular model I purchased was red, V6, sunroof, 6 CD changer and grey leather interior.  I LIKE IT.

After much worry, indecisiveness, and research on the internet and chasing cars down the highway so I could get a better look, I finally decided on the Mercury Cougar.    I had driven an Isuzu Rodeo for the last 4 years, and decided I wanted to go back to a sports car.  Well I think I�m one of a few select people these days looking for anything other than a SUV.   There is just not a lot available these days in the �sports� car department unless you want the Camaro or the Mustang.   Personally, I�m bored with these cars (no offensive to anyone with one).   I liked the new stylish design of the Cougar, and the quick enough pick-up of the Cougar.  It is also definitely a little more roomier than a Camaro and the back-seat, while it is definitely not for Grandma, is comfy enough for little people.  The reason I used the phrase �quick enough pick-up of the Cougar� is, because one of the few critisms I found regarding the Cougar is the V6 engine is not up to par with its competition (ie., Camaro and Mustang).  After test driving it though, I figured out real quick, it�s quick enough for me!!  

After test driving one and doing my MSRP vs dealer invoice research on the internet, I headed out to Plano Lincoln Mercury (Plano, TX) .  Of all the Mercury dealers in the Dallas/Ft Worth area, they have the most to choose from.   Heading into the dealership, I had the exact car I had in mind and the price I was ready to pay.  I was not looking forward to this one little bit.  Every car purchase I had ever done left me with a bitter taste in my mouth and the ability to spit nails (talented huh?).    Maybe I had a look on my face that said �don�t mess with me bucko� or maybe it was the fact the salesman new I had dealer invoice pricing at my fingertips, but when it got down to the price of the vehicle, the salesman says �how would $100 over dealer invoice be�.   And that was that!

The one little obstacle I ran into was I wanted a blue one with a V6 manual transmission.  Guess what, blue is considered a feminine color and V6 manuals are considered �masculine�.     If I really wanted blue, it would have had to be factory ordered.  They don�t come off the line in that combination!  Well � the nerve.  So, I decided the red one wasn�t too bad.  

NOW THIS IS WHAT YOU DO NOT DO WITH A NEW VEHICLE.  Do not drive immediately to your brother and sister-in-laws house that happens to be out in the country in the middle of BFE and also happens to have �DITCHES� on the side of their gravel driveway.  Also, do not attempt to back-out of the driveway after dark when you are not that familiar with the vehicle and where the �DITCH� is.   Yep � I did it �  I put the right front driver�s front-end into the �DITCH� when the car was 4 hours old.    It took 4 people pulling up on the front end, and 2 people in the rear pushing down on the rear end so I could get enough traction to get MY CAR OUT OF THE DITCH.   At this writing I consider myself lucky that I only had one small dent in the right quarter panel that cost me $200 to have fixed.  

#2 THING NOT DO WITH VEHICLE 4 DAYS OLD:  Do not hesitate to look for cars before turning right.    This causes the lady who you just happen to work with, to REAR END you knocking the Diet Dr Pepper out of your hand and onto the dashboard.   Did I mention above Mercury Cougars have excellent back bumpers.  It was a hard enough hit to knock that drink out of my hands and to give me a stiff neck for 2 �3 days, but only left a little green paint from her bumper on mine.    The man fixing the dent in my quarter panel was nice enough to buff out the green paint for free!

The car is not coming out of the driveway when it is 4 months old.
