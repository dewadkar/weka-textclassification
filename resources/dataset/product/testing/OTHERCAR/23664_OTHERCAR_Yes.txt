                          I have been considering buying a Digital Camera for some time now. I searched up all the information I could read on the internet about Digital camera's. I went to a Camera store and also asked the salesman questions. Like how many pixels do you really need to have clean crisp pictures. He told me that for every day home use most people do not need more than 2.0 million pixels. Any thing higher would be a waste unless you are a professional, or you want to have pictures larger than 8X10.
              The salesman also said that the latest camera out on the market was the new Fuji cameras with the new XD-picture card, it is the size of a penney and use half the power than other cards, and that they are the future of Digital Cameras. He said that both Olympus and FujiFilm developed this card jointly. At the time I was looking in to information on this camera, it had been out just a few weeks and the selling price was $249.99.
               It has now been four weeks deciding what camera to buy, yesterday I decided to go and buy the Fuji 2650 Digital Camera. It wasn't that easy to do, I went to five stores before finding one. You see there has been a price drop on this camera and it is selling for $199.99 just about every were you look, and all the stores are sold out and are taking orders. One camera shop told me that this is a unheard of price for a Digital Camera with these features.
               I brought the new camera home, sat down read the directions, and started to take pictures, I then down loaded them on the computer which took about a minute for four pictures. I also printed them out on photo paper, the pictures came out clean, crisp, great color and looked like I had them developed at a store. If I can do this the first time, I am sure any one can take perfect pictures the first time with this camera.
                The FujiFilm Digital Camera 2650 comes with 2.0 Million Effective Pixels, 1600X1200 Recorded Pixels,3XOptical Zoom Lens, a LCD monitor 1.5", you can also make Movies with out sound, Internet conferencing, USB universal Serial Bus, picture software, and is designed for Microsoft Windows XP.It also comes with a strap, batteries and a 16MB XD-Picture card. You can buy additional cards in 32MB, 64MB, and a 128MB. Most Digital cameras have four batteries in them making the heavy, This camera has only two AA batteries since the new XD-picture card uses half the power than other cards.
                For this price and features this is the camera to buy this year for Christmas if you can find one, you can't go wrong for the price, features.
