            Okay you have read all the reviews here about this digital camera, but you haven't heard my opinion yet of it.

First thing, what�s in the  box, software that needs to be upgraded to version 2.51, which you can get that from Olympus web site so that�s an easy download for those of us who using Windows XP Home or Pro version.

The 8 Meg Smart Media card is okay, but I quickly got the 128 Meg card for it. Highly recommended you get that if you plan on taking a lot of pictures and using the QuickTime movie feature.

As for the batteries you need to buy Rechargeable ones like Rayovac NiMH 1600 mAh AA, well you can use any other brand, but that�s what I use and so far after 37 photo�s with flash and HQ setting they still showing full charge.

You might want to buy a mini tripod so you can have the camera take shots of you and someone else using the timer built-in. Well it�s a suggestion.

There isn�t a case for this camera, so you can buy one for it, yes it has its own built-in lens cover which slides forward and back and turns on the camera and off. 
But my advice gets a case for it. Protect your purchase.

In all you can sum this camera up, powerful, excellent pictures and cost is very low for taking very professional looking pictures and viewing them on your home TV or PC.

The newer version the D-520, doesn�t have all the features like this camera like the ISO only goes up to 80-160 while the D-510Z has a range from 100 � 400.

If you can find this camera, but it, you won�t be sorry if you do.

Good Luck!
