            I purchased a base model Neon back in March of 96.  The only option is the AM/FM radio.  I use it as my daily driver to go back and forth to work.  It averages about 29 MPG so it's easy on the finances.

The cars strengths are it's strong engine, and sports car like handling.  It's main weakness is it's uncomfortable seat.  The base models seats aren't comfortable for any ride over 45 minutes.

I did have one major incident, a blown head gasket at 26,000 miles.  Luckily it happened on the last day of the warranty so it was replaced for no charge.  I was told it would have cost $700 to repair it.

Other than the blown head gasket, I've replaced the front break rotors at about 18,000 miles when I also replaced the front brakes.  The rotors were warped causing the brake pedal to pulsate.  I'm told that it's fairly normal to replace brake rotors that early on new vehicles.

The car currently has 33,000 miles on it, and it's working fine so far.  I'm just wondering if I'll have to replace the head gasket again at 52,000 miles.

The Neon is a fun little car to drive (with the manual transmission).  It's served its purpose well.<br><br>
