             We fell in love the moment we test drove our brand new BRAVADA. Yes, we shopped around looking for an SUV that wasn't on a truck body, that wasn't boxy, that had some get up and go while at the same time gave reasonable gas mileage and of course, wasn't noisy. We found quiet elegance in the BRAVADA.

 Inside it was like a luxury car, with the electronic adjustable heated plush leather seats which definitely had my vote before we left the lot. The fantastic multi-system music center had me itching for long drives in the country. The special little things are all there: the two system sunroof, the digital compass, the outside temperature gauge, and the miles left in my gas tank has been a lifesaver. 

 The handling was what really sold me. No dial or switches to get into 4-wheel drive, this SUV has a brain and knows when to switch over. The back truck area is huge and the back seat folds out for even more area. The tinted windows and the canape cover hide my personal belongs from prying eyes. 

I can't say enough about my BRAVADA, except maybe to strongly recommend a test drive before you purchase any comparably-priced SUV. You will be glad you did!!!!<br><br>
