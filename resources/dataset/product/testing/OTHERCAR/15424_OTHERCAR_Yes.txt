            I love my 1999 Volkswagon GTi.  A few months ago it was time for me to buy a new car, and I'd recently fallen in love with the GTi and the whole mark-4 golf family.  1999 was the first year for the mark-4's, and yet the GTi doesn't seem to suffer from the problems that often plague redesigned autos in the past.  But this is a Volkswagon, and not just any Volkswagon, the GTi!  The GTi's are well known for years and years of reliability and use.  I see many every day from the 80's in the mark-2 flavor.  Everybody I have talked to that has ever owned kept it forever and loved it.

This car is fast, and very functional.  The rear seat folds down nearly flush with the back, and the head rests come off to clamp onto the front of the back seats!  You have to see it to believe it.  The GTi holds more cargo than much bigger cars, such as my ex-car, a Dodge Neon.  VW knows how to be almost excessive while still being classy.  There is even a visor that folds down above the rear-view mirror to keep the sun out of your eyes since it often sneaks through that hard to guard place.

I've taken my GTi up over 110mph, and it does so without a hitch.  Keep in mind this is the four cyl. flavor, not the VR6.  0-60 in about 7.5 seconds.  Transmission is very smooth, you must must get the manual in this car.  It is marvelous.  I test drove an automatic, too.  It was really nice as well, but not nearly as much fun!  Almost everything in this car is controlled by the computer, there is no longer a timing belt, or other things you may be used to in a car.  There is a governor that keeps you below 120mph, but there are people that make new chips to open that up for you, and give you some more pony-power, too.

I held off on the leather seats because I tend to drive and corner hard and don't want to be sliding around.  But I realize now I should have, since the clam-shell like seats would keep my butt firmly planted in the drivers seat, where it always wants to be, and should always belong.  I've never wanted to drive so much in my life.

Gas mileage is pretty good, I average up to 300 miles 'tween fillings, and I'm also only using premium gasoline.  (Here in the States it is about $1.30 a gallon, but I feel the car is happier being pampered as nicely as possible.)

The sunroof is awesome, with a dial to set a position instead of holding your finger on something like an idiot waiting for it to open to the desired position.  A special 'notch' is about 5/8 of the way open, just prior to the buffeting you will get if your windows are up.  Four airbags standard.  Antilock breaks standard.  Really slick keyless entry standard.  You can even roll up the windows and the sunroof with the key.  8 speaker sound system sounds great, the best factory system I've ever heard.  I also got their 6 disc CD changer.  Its over priced.  You can get cheaper ones that will work with the VW tuner.  The side view mirrors are tinted lightly to cut down on glare.

Comfortable car, the GTi.  Highly adjustable seats move you up, down, front, back.  Back seats, however, are not something you can have people sprawl out in.  Bigger passangers will be cramped, I'm 6'4&quot;, so short people have to sit behind me when I'm driving to not take off their legs.  Really awesome headlamps, too.  The mark-4 golf doesn't have the rear spoiler standard, but any VW sport shop has after market parts like that.  I recommend getting this car lowered a bit with the newer, tighter, suspension kit.  The car seems a little high and loose in turns, making it smooth and comfortable, but I really like to hug the road while taking a turn quickly.

The VR6 model adds the bigger 6 cyl. engine, and heated leather seats, climtronic climate control, trip computer, and limited slip differential and traction control just to name a few little changes.  It also has a nicer looking dash, (though my SO would disagree there).  You cannot get the VR6 in an automatic.  

Though to be honest, if you can't drive a stick shift, you shouldn't be looking at delightful piece of automotive excellence.  

I find the price to be a little high, but this small car is way ahead of the competition in too many ways to not feel like you're still getting it for a steal.  It feels a lot safer and better than a Honda Civic, and beats other cars in its class hands-down.  If you want a cheaper car in a similar style, go for the Golf GL/GLS or wait for the Pogo to be released in the US.  

But then again, if you are looking at GTi's, you know why you want it.  Because its fast, and has that euro sex-appeal you have been looking for!  I know I am sure to have forgotten other things I love about this car, but if I wrote them all down, I get a hand-cramp, and I need to make sure my hands are in good shape for driving!<br><br>
