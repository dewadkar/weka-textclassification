            My 1984 Saab 900S is the best car I've owned. I got it used from the original owner in 1987, to replace my 1987 Honda CRX Si, which was a fun car, but too lightweight.

The Saab now has 165,000 miles on it and shows no signs of giving up. It still starts on the first crank most times and runs very smoothly.

This car has had a good service record, overall. 1984 was a decent year on the Saab assembly line. It has had one new alternator, two water pumps, a couple of clutch master cylinders, several CV joints (mostly my fault for &quot;off-roading&quot;), a transmission rebuild and a new exhaust system so far, with the bulk of these repairs taking place in the last two years. I've been pretty consistent, though not perfect, about taking it in for scheduled maintenance and oil changes, so I am very pleased with its overall cost of operation.

At high altitude, it's getting 20-25 mpg around town and 30+ mpg with more highway driving. I used to get 30-35 average in the CRX, which weighs only 2/3 what the Saab does and has less horsepower.

The Saab is fun to drive, with good handling characteristics thanks to its front-wheel drive, a heavy but smooth gearbox, decent power and good visibility. It also has the best seats of any car I've yet owned, or driven.

Another great Saab feature, on the 3-door, is the back seat that folds forward. If you remove the head rests from the back seat, it will click into place behind the front seats, forming a cargo space almost as large as that of a small pickup truck with a shell.

Saabs have a few quirks the prospective buyer should know about. On 900's, the ignition switch is in the floor of the car, since it has a transmission lock instead of a steering column lock. You have to put the transmission in reverse to get your keys out. Saab factory alarm systems were terrible. If yours has one, disconnect it and get a good alarm system from a professional installer, if you need one. Some Saabs of this vintage have automatic heated seats, which almost never work. Don't be surprised when they don't work, if you find one that says it has heated seats.

In the early to mid-80's, Saabs suffered from paint problems that affected many other makes as well, due to environmental reformulations of auto paint. My car has lost a good deal of its original clear-coat over the past few years as a result. However, I haven't yet had any problems with rust.

Lastly, it can be hard to find a good Saab repair shop. It's best to find a shop that only works on Saabs. Failing that, one should probably take it to the dealer for repairs (and be prepared to pay the premium).

I'm trying to keep this car as long as I can. I don't want to go looking for another used 900S! I'm so attached to my Saab, I would be very reluctant to switch makes or even models.<br><br>
