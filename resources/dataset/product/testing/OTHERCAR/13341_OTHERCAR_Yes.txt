            I bought my 1990 Chevy Beretta when I was 17 years old.  I needed a car to get me to school and work.  Over three years later, I am still driving the car and loving it.  It is a great car.  

As a high schooler, my driving skills were less than perfect and I put that car through heck, but it still kept going.  I have driven my Beretta on numerous vacations and never had any problems.  It is a very reliable car.  There was one time it didn't start and that was due to water in the gas tank.  

There is little maintenance that is needed to keep the car running well.  It is comfortable inside with bucket seats and air conditioning.  It is a great car for a first time car buyer.  There is nothing more reliable.  Some of the repairs that I have had to make include new fuel injectors, new altenator, tires, battery, shocks, exhaust, brakes, and ignition.  Most of these are just normal maintenance issues.  

My Beretta has a 3.1 liter V-6 engine, automatic transmission, Air Conditioning, bucket seats, and tilt wheel. 

If you are considering a Beretta, I suggest that you buy one.   You won't be disappointed.<br><br>
