            The Acura 2.3CL is extremely comfortable to sit in due to it's power adjusted front drivers seat and in addition has an adjustable lumbar support.It's driving performance is quite sporty holding well in cornering and being quite maneuverable.The wide 205 tires grip very well and the ABS Disk Brakes on all 4 wheels make for sure stopping.It also has wonderful luxury features including leather seats,moon roof,Garage opener,and automatic temperature control.The only slight drawback was it's average acceleration in starting speeds.This car suits couples,single people and small family persons.It isn't for larger families or a third family member who has trouble in getting into the rear seat of a two door car.I saw nothing in it's price range to offer its features,Acura reliability,4 year warranty at this price.<br><br>
