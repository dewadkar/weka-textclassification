            I bought my Neon in April of 96.  From the start I enjoyed the car and am still driving it.  I bought a very basic car with a standard transmission (for financial reasons) and have not had any trouble with the transmission at all.  My Neon has averaged around 35 miles per gallon but started at around 40 mpg.  This is really good considering I normally drive at very high speeds (70+ most of the time).  At these high speeds the Neon runs very smoothly and the only problem is the windows tend to leak air because they are pressure sealed.  I've got 100,000 miles on the car already and have had no major mechanical problems.  In recent months I've developed an oil leak but it's around the gaskets where you would expect to find a leak after that many miles.

I've never had any trouble with the Neon losing power with the air conditioner on and for a four cylinder it has pretty good pickup.  The A/C is VERY cold - which is a plus in Texas weather.  If you idle with the A/C on for long periods of time, it tends to blow the safety valve and release some of the freon but that is easily solved by not running the A/C while sitting still (like when waiting for your kids after school).  

The dash controls are very basic and one of mine broke about a year ago.  the control that turns the air flow from vents to floor to defrost broke right behind where you grip it so to change the air flow I now have to pull the dash out and move the cable by hand - of course this is easily fixed at the service department.

I live on very bad roads and travel a great deal and have only recently needed top have an alignment.  The Neon handles very well in all weather conditions.

i would highly recommend the Neon to anyone looking for a great economical small car.<br><br>
