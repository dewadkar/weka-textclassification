             The wife needed a new car quick. Without warning, just before Christmas 1998, her motor in her old car went. With Christmas around the corner we had to think of the best and quickest way to buy a car. So we went to the local Ford dealer who was known for great deals and also had a &quot;push, pull, or tow&quot; deal as well. We browsed the lot and she really loved the Ford Taurus. But the dealer informed us that the Mercury Sable was the same car just a bit less in cost. So we went with it. She test drove it down the road (the dealer actually didn't even come with us). I drove it back. We liked it. So we bought a 1996 Mercury Sable with just over 60,000 miles on it. 

 Well. About two weeks out and about, we heard a loud thump from the right front as she corned from a stop sign. What is up with this? We didn't hear it for awhile, but about a month later it did it again. To this day, no one knows what it is and it still happens here and there. 

 Anyhow, we got the warmer weather and she went to use her AC. Well, it didn't work. We took it to get it refilled and they told us there was a leak in it and it would cost $125 to fix. Great right? Nothing like a two year old car having an AC leak already! Nice right?

 And now the real problem yet we run into. Winter of 1999 (the car only 3 years old) approaches. The cold weather hits. She goes to work and notices the heat isn't working properly. The next day she notices the car's temperature gauge rising when she is at a stand still. Hoping it was the thermostat and a quick cheap fix, we bring to a local place we know well. Well, it ends up the Head Gasket needed to be replaced! The car is only 3 years old! These things really don't happen! Thank god we purchased the extended warranty through the dealer (though a $100 copay). 

 Now we have it back and only a few days later, we notice it bucks. When driving along it feels like it just loses it's get up and go and gives a small hesitation and bucking. This of course can be several things. What it is we don't know YET! Stay tuned right? 

 On the other hand. The car runs great when the problems are fixed. It drives quiet with little noise or vibrations. It is very spacious in the front and back seats. The interior is sharp. The dash board set up is pretty sharp. The stock tape player radio cranks for a stock radio! And it handles very well. Take it from someone who drives like a maniac! Sometimes you look down though and actually don't notice just how fast you are driving. It has great acceleration be it from a stopped position or in motion and need to pass on the highway or something. 

 Overall the car seems like it is a good. Maybe we got the lemon of the dealer because we were in a rush and they knew it? Maybe we shouldn't have made a purchase on the car with that many miles on it? Or just maybe don't by it used it all? All in all... 3 years old with all these problems? Something isn't right.

 And now we hear something about a recall on 1996 radiators? Still checking into this one... So don't quote me on this and hold me to it. Just look into for yourself if you need to. 

 Hope this helps you at all. If I had to do it again, I would choose something different though. Maybe the wife wouldn't, But I would!<br><br>
