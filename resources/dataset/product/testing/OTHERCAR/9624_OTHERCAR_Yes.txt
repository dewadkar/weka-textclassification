                 I am becoming a big Sony fan lately and was in the market for a new digital camera.  I found it to be a great camera for what I use it for: Taking pictures of my kids to have for years to come.  Most of the pictures I have taken have been in the 3-5 foot range and I have to say they turn out great.  The quality when printed out to an 8X10 is truly perfect and I don't think you could beat it with spending thousands of dollars.  I have yet to take any landscape pictures with it but I'm sure not to be disapointed.  The MPEG feature is a nice extra to use for e-mailing a short movie to the grand parents now and then.  I've found the flash to be excellent.  The best I've ever seen on a camera.  I couldn't believe how it takes a very bright picture in a completly dark room.
     I find this camera very easy to use.  I'm not electronics expert and for me this thing is great.  I only had to open the manual once or twice to get started.
     I'm pretty impressed with the battery life it's had also.  I can take probably 80 or 90 pictures on one set of rechargable batteries it comes with.
     The camera comes with a 16MB memory card.  I can tell you now that's not enough.  You'll want to spend the extra money and buy the 128MB or 256MB.  I went with the 128MB and on the best quality setting I can hold about 100-110 pictures at once.  I suggest ebay when looking for a memory card for the best prices.
    Now for the few cons.  Every once in a while it will take a real blurry picture.  I'm not sure if it's camera shake or not.  It doesn't happen very often so I can't complain.  Another thing is after using the flash it takes a good 10 or 12 seconds to be ready to use again.  Also it only come with batteries, a charger and instructions.  No case.  And for the last thing, I don't really like the program Sony gives you to upload and organize the pictures.  I find it difficult to use and sluggish.  
     Other than those few minor things I'm very happy with this camera.  I've found it to be the best camera I've ever owned and have now relalized I will probably never buy a 35mm again!
