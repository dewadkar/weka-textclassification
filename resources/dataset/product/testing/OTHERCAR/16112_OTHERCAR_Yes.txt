             We bought a 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee with the new smaller but more powerful engine. We live in a snow climate and it handles wonderfully. We test drove most of the SUV's available and chose the Jeep for its ride above anything else, the vehicle rides more smooth than any of the others, we found that there was a lot of stiff bounce in most SUVs but the Jeep was smoothest. Driving the Jeep is easy and comfortable, we have taken a long road trip of 1550 miles and found we did not have to stop and rest as we were comfortable. There seems to be significantly more shoulder room inside. 
 The Jeep cost a little more than a lot of the others but is worth the extra money. Any one who likes the security of driving a sure tracking vehicle that rides smoother than any other in the class should buy this SUV. <br><br>
