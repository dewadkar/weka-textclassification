            I had always wanted a Camaro so, when I needed a car in 1997, I searched for a used beauty.  I located a used 1994 6 cylinder coupe with automatic transmission, CD player, and all power options.  I do admit that, since I purchased the vehicle used, I have no idea what it was though prior to my possession.  Anyway, here are my experiences.

First off, the positives.  I love how the seats felt and the manner in which the controls are laid out.  Seats are very comfortable and wrap around the average size person quite nicely.  They are more than adequate for support during long trips.  The controls are very no-nonsense and are quite easy to manipulate.  Gauges are also laid out well.  However, I am less than happy with the quality of my car.  Both door panels worked themselves loose.  The Chevrolet dealers informed me that Chevrolet does not recommend reattaching loose door panels; they recommend attaching all NEW panels.  So, the cost of simply fixing door panels that have worked themselves loose would be $700.  Also, the interior has a very cheap feel.  Plastics are very cheap and the center &quot;island&quot; that encloses the gear shift comes off quite easily.  In addition, the car is not sealed well; air comes in through the console and wind/engine noise is very loud.  My car also started to exhibit problems shifting from overdrive to third gear.  The transmission would buck and would not want to engage.  Needless to say, I traded the car REAL quick and now own another automobile.  Lastly, the car rattles... at LOT.  Do not expect a quite, sealed ride in the Camaro.  

In short, if you want a Camaro just to own a Camaro (like I did), go for it.  However, I will never ever buy another Camaro and have serious reservations about all Chevrolet products after this experience.
