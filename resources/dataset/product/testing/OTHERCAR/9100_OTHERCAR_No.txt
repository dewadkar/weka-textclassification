            My review on the 1999 Kia Sportage. I needed a car, and I'm only 19(just turned 19). I was 18 at the time I got the Kia. I needed an affordable car and one that wasn't to much because my sister was cosigning for me. Anyways, we went to a Toyota dealership and was looking at used cars when I spotted the 1999 Kia Sportage(satan in disguise). I took one look at it and was in LOVE! I just had to have this car! BIG MISTAKE! We were lied to on several things, one the warranty! We had about 6 different sales associates tell us we had the 10 year 100,000 mile warranty(the main reason we bought the car. The warranty(even on new ones isn't even transferable, so if you buy a used one the 10 year 100,000 warranty isn't on it!) We bought the car in Jan. 2002, less than ONE MONTH of owning the car the problems began. One day on my way to work the car died at a red light, then after restarting it, it was ok(or so I thought). The next day I went to start it and it wouldn't start! I tried like 20 times and it still wouldn't start. So we had the dealership I bought it from tow it there to fix(b/c there 60 day warranty was the only one I had). They said it was spark plugs and censors. We took the car back everything seemed fine, then less then ONE WEEK it started again. They towed it back and said nothing was wrong so we took the car back. Again less then two weeks this time same thing! Again they said nothing was wrong with it, so we took it back. Finally on the fourth time they said it was the starter, they fixed it costing me $50.00(thank God for that dealer warranty!) Then my warranty with them ran out. In May 2002, I started having problems again just little though, when I went to pull out of our neighborhood, it wouldn't go but, then it was fine. Then in late June it got really bad! When I would start it to go to work it would go about 5 miles an hour(no matter how hard you pushed the gas), then it would just all the sudden kick in. Well, in early July I had a mechanic friend of mine check it out with his computer that they hook up to your car and look for codes, and it said nothing was wrong. The next day on my way to work it was doing the same thing going like 5 miles an hour. Well it had kicked in, in my neighborhood, so I pulled onto out into the street(one of the main roads,lots of traffic) thinking the car was ok, I pulled into the middle median(and it did that 5 mile an hour thing) everything seemed fine though, then I pulled onto the main street in the left lane and it was still doing it, so I had to put on my hazzards and try to get into the right lane to get off the road. Three seperate cars almost hit me, I was so scared, all I could do was pull into a left turn lane, and just cry. This happened three days in a row. Well shortly after, my sister and I started the search for a new car. The only problem is NO ONE will give you what I owed on the car(or even close!) Even a Kia dealership was only gonna give me 4,000 and I owed 9,000!(and the car is a 99 and only had 24,000 miles on it!) While in the midst of looking for a new car,(in mid July) the A/C couldn't be run without stalling the car!(I live in Florida!) Finally last Saturday, I got rid of that POS! I'm so happy, I could only imagine how much it would've cost to repair that car! So in my opinion, if your thinking of buying a Kia DON'T!!!
