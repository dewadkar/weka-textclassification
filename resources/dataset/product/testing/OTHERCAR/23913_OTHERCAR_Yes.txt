                 When one first sees the Audi TT they are pleasantly surprised.  This is the nicest design that Audi has come up with in a long time.  The roofline is low and sweeping with a broad C pillar.  The whole design is seamless and perfect.  
     Once inside the Audi TT you will first notice that the quarters may be tight but the ergonomics are exellent.  There is a nice brushed aluminum panel that covers the radio controls, and there is also aluminum on the shifter and doors.  The back quarters are tight, even for children.
     The nicest surprise is yet to come.  The car turns on with a nice growl, and shifting into first is easy and smooth.  The acclration is better than good, and the handling is superb.
     This is a spectacular new car from Audi, which is really making a name fo itself in the sports car field.
