              Well i would like to start this out by saying i love this car its the most beautiful car i think anyone can own and along with its 3.0 liter twin turbo charged engine it makes a winning combonation. This car is perfect combining beautiful exterior with stock 13 second quarter mile times there is no beating this toyota muscle car. I have never known an unsatisfied supra owner. And along with that toyota reliability i recomend this car to anybody unless you are looking for a family car but that is the only reason anyone should lose interest in this awesome vehicle.<br><br>
