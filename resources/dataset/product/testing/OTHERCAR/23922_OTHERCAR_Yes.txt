             I'll start off by saying that I've been very pleased with the results of the images captured from this camera.

 This camera has 3.2 effective megapixels, 3x optical zoom and 3x digital zoom, for a collective total of 9x. I'll even go so far as to say I'm impressed with the digital zoom, which you may or may not know actually interpolates an image and is generally not recommended if the quality of image matters to you. I compared the digital zoom of this camera to an enlargement via Lizard Tech's Genuine Fractals (a $300 Photoshop plugin that interpolates a file up to 600 percent without image degradation). The results? I actually prefered the camera's digital zoom (and that's not something you'll hear every day). 

 If you like advanced features this camera has plenty: Auto, Program Auto Exposure, Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority, Manual Exposure Control and Scene Select Mode, which contains the modes Portrait, Snapshot, Landscape, Night View and Black&White. In addition to the modes other advanced features include metering (center and spot), white balance (auto, daylight, fluorescent and tungsten), light sensitivity ISO100, 200&400 and gamma correction (highlight, darkness and contrast). 

 As far as camera use there is a bit of a learning curve, unless of course you are familiar with these features or experienced with SLR's. Needless to say (but I'll say it anyways) it pays familliarize yourself to the operation manual. Yes, you could just leave the camera in auto mode, but don't expect to capture the potentially excellent images this camera can provide.

 The overall construction of the camera is seems pretty solid, and the dimensions are aprox. 4.5" x 2.5" x 2.5"; a little too large to simply be stuffed into a pocket. The LCD screen has it's pros and cons: it's a 1.5" screen that can be seen remarkablly well in bright light, but is easily smudged with finger prints. Also, the lens cover is a simple plastic that is akin to the type that fits over a milk jug. Over all, the price (around $200-$250) is fair and picture quality is excellent. Though not a professional camera, I believe this unit to be easy enough to use for most and enough features for the enthusiast to appreciate. And yes, I recommended it.
