               I have always wanted a pickup since I was a little kid.  Something about the higher ride, and the whole tough car attitude a truck can give off.  Now my S-10 is not by any means that tough of a truck with it's 2200 vortec 4-cylinder engine, however as a college student the average 20-22 mpg on city roads, helps keeps gas spending low.  My truck is a 1999 s-10 extended cab 2wd.  It has a 5 speed manual transmission with overdrive, dark charcoal grey interior, tinted glass, and upgraded rims.  I've of course added a couple modifications to the truck (stereo, suspension, and a bed cover).

    Overall I have been extreamely happy with the way the truck rides.  No longer must you know your riding in a pickup truck.   It handles well, although it still hasn't seen the harsh Chicago winters yet either.

   For those of you who want a little more power, the s-10 offers an optional 4300 vortec v-6, and four wheel drive packages to keep your wheels driving forward.

  Chevy also offers a really cool package called the s-10 extreame.  this features a factory lowered suspension premium 17" rims, ground effects, and  is available in both 4 and 6 cylinder.  However, they have yet to come out with an all wheel drive version yet.

  For those off road types, the s-10 comes with a ZR-2 off road package featuring the 4300 v-6, 4x4, raised suspension, and fender flares.  This package looks and is a very nice commodity for the truck, but you can look to be spending about $4000 for the package.

  In the time, I have had my s-10, I have grown to love it.  It's a sporty looking truck that gets great gas milage, and has room to move me around to wherever I may be going in a couple years from now.  I was recommended to the s-10 by a friend, and I would reccommend this truck to any one of my friends interested in a light duty pick up.
