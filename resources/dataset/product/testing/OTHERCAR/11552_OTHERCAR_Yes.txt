            The Jeep Cherokee would make its namesakes proud. The Cherokee is strong, sturdy and dependable. I recently got a Cherokee, after driving a minivan for seven years. I was worried about the loss of the second back seat, but after a few packing and seating adjustments, it was not a problem.
 
I took the Cherokee on a trip through the Georgia and Alabama hills, and conformably fit five happy passengers. The Jeep is powerful, and can reach the speed limit in great time. It is also steady on the curves, and never once felt top-heavy or hard to manage. I drove through torrential downpours on unfamiliar roads, and felt completely safe. The wipers were high-powered, and the Jeep hugged the road. 

The extras included in the Jeep are luxurious (remember, Iï¿½ve been driving a van for a long time), including a CD player, a niche for your garage-door opener, and sunglasses compartment, an extra power outlet, auto locks and power windows. 

Although I occasionally miss the second back seat (well, actually my dog does), the Jeep Cherokee has been a comfortable and dependable vehicle to be proud of.
