            In 1997 the wife needed a different vehicle, her subaru just died,so we chose the Chevy Blazer. What attracted us was the size and room that the blazer offered. Four doors with cargo area, ease of handling, four wheel drive. The 4.3l vortec v6 produces plenty of power for towing a utility trailer or smaller boat, personal water craft or tent trailer. Fuel economy is good (20-26 mpg). Handling in traffic is that of a car,although steering is a bit stiff, it is very precise. 
Chevy claims room for six, but the most I would say is four adults or two adults with three kids. 
This vehicle is a great for a family. It offers great visibility good fuel economy, the ability to haul a small trailer. Has a comfortable ride. The four wheel drive operates great and adds safety in inclement weather conditions.
All in all a great mid-sized family vehicle, one worth checking out<br><br>
