            The Chrysler 300M, rated in the world's 10 Best Cars by Car &amp; Driver Magazine, defeats it's Sports Sedan competition, both import and domestic, by every measure.  The V-8 calibre horsepower, race-track handling, and luxury-car accommodations combine to take this ride over the top.
I test-drove 10 different sports sedans, including the Lincoln LS (V6 &amp; V8), the BMW 3 Series, Volvo S80, Audi A4 &amp; A6, Acura 3.2, Oldsmobile Aurora (V6 &amp; V8), Lexus ES300 and Infiniti IS300, and remain convinced that the Chrysler is the superior ride.  Despite it's cavernous interior dimensions, the 300M's ability to respond and handle like a much smaller car continues to amaze, while it's comfort and convenience bring a smile to each of it's passengers.
Needless to say, the fact that the 300M stickers well below each of it's competitors doesn't hurt either.  The extremely low-cost of the available Performance Handling Group option makes this American Sports Sedan the latest enthusiast's dream from Chrysler!
Whether you're an enthusiast on a budget, or an executive with a taste for performance and style, the 300M definitely belongs on your list of must-drives.  In a heads-up comparison, this car easily outclasses it's competition from a performance standpoint, and it's eye-catching good looks will keep you arriving in style for years to come.<br><br>
