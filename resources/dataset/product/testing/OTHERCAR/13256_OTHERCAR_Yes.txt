            Revised Mar.02/01



This car is class. Ample room for a mid size. Fit and finish is top rate. Ride and quiet levels are excellent.

The Accord EX V6 version comes with just about everything; pwr. drivers seat, heated front seats, cruise, tilt, air, auto climate control, pwr. sunroof, Leather interior, CD player w/o cassette (I don't know why), ABS,dual exhaust... well sort of. (one main pipe coming from the manifolds then splitting into 2 mufflers and tail pipes). The trunk is huge and the rear seats are split and can be folded down to put even more essentials in your car. There is also a "pass through concealed by the rear seat center armrest. Really nice if you want to put those expensive skis in the cabin. One pet peeve; with all that room in the trunk, there are not any tie downs that come as standard equipment. So if you don't opt. for the additional cost of the cargo net, your valuables get tossed around like a wood chip in a bucket of water. Shame on you Honda, that's cheap.

Now for the V6 Engine (200HP. 195 Foot pounds of Torque)

Not enough o's in smoooooth to describe this piece of work.
Most times when you're at a stop light, you can't feel it running. When I first bought this car, I was constantly looking down at the tachometer when I was stopped to see if it was in fact idling or if it had stalled. Real smooth.
This can be attributed to 2 balance shafts spinning counter clockwise thus eliminating a large portion of vibration. The 4 cyl. has one as well.

Power is delivered evenly and as you hit 3000 RPM. then the VTEC (variable valve timing) cuts in and whoosh... wake up time. The engine sings right up to it's governed 6500 RPM limit with out any protest. I've had this car up to 120MPH and the vehicle feels just as secure as if you are cruising at 60 MPH. The Vtec V6 is a joy and has the refinement to please the most demanding individual in this price range.  

I did try the Accord 4 cylinder Vtec. Reasonable power and very competent. The V6 version you got to try though. The 2 cars are completely different in every way from power, handling, to noise level. The 4 cylinder version also comes with slimmer tires which unfortunately does not help the cause.

I am not completely happy with the automatic transmission. Honda retards the timing between shifts to put less stress on the tranny. This is not pleasant under hard acceleration as there is a noticeable delay between shift points and then heaves you into the next gear. This is not what I expected out of honda. However you do get used to it and once you "learn" the cars shift patterns, it becomes tolerable. Besides you should not be driving like the earth was coming to an end anyway, right? In all fairness, the transmission works great under normal driving conditions.

I opted for the fog lamps (clear lens) from Honda and boy was I pleasantly surprised. Very pricey ($320.00 US installed)These are manufactured by Raybrig. A high quality and well respected name in racing. The Headlights in the Accord are very good to start with but combining these fog lamps will give you an output increase of about 40% more usable light. This is greatly appreciated if you do any night driving. 

To sum up
The 1999 Accord is essentially unchanged for 2001. This car is not cheap, but for the level of performance coupled with quality and refinement... it delivers.
