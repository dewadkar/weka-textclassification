            The Canon S40 has got to be one of the (if not THE) most feature-packed camera in its class. Canon has managed to squeeze most of the features found in the popular Powershot G2 into this pocket-sized body. As much technical details about the S40 has already been written, I would just like to add my 2 cents' worth from the point of view of a G2 owner.

<B>Better Than G2</B>

Some features of the S40 which I find better than those in the G2 are as follows.

<I>Size</I>

This is very subjective. Some would probably prefer the size of the G2 to that of the S40. A bigger and heavier camera is generally better as it is easier to hold and is more stable, thereby reducing the risk of camera shake when the shutter release is depressed.

I, however, love the reduced size of the S40 and the slightly lighter weight. This is because I love to bring my camera everywhere I go. (You will never know when a photo opportunity may arise!)

Although small in size, it is certainly not too small (unlike say, the Minolta X) and it feels very substantial in your hands. Because it's length is more or less the same as the G2, it is easy to hold.

<I>Body Design</I>

The full metal body design is very elegant and aesthetically pleasing. The cool metal body feels nice in your hands. This is much nicer than the metal-plastic finish of the G2.

One of the things that irritates me about the G2 is the lens cap. A lot of times I find myself unable to switch the camera on because I forgot to remove the lens cap. You see, on the G2, once you switch on the camera, the lens will extend and with the lens cap on it cannot do this and you will hear a series of beeps with an error message on the top LCD screen. If that happens, you will need to switch the camera off, remove the cap and switch it on again. The lens cap then dangles in your hands. Unless I hold the lens cap in my hand, it will dangle in front of the lens when I take photos in the "portrait" mode.

No such problems here with the S40. Just slide open the front cover and the camera is switched on and the lens extends. To switch it off, just push the cover in the opposite direction and the lens will retract and the camera will be switched off. No buttons or dials (unlike the G2) to fiddle with. No danger of forgetting to take the lens cap off. No dangling cap to obstruct your lens!

<I>Quick Preview</I>

This is such a good feature I wonder why it was not incorporated into the G2. There is a button at the back of the camera (above the LCD display) that allows you to switch to preview (or play) mode and see the photo you just took almost instantly.

With the G2, you'd need to turn the dial from record to play before you can see the photo displayed in the LCD screen. To get back to recording, you'd need to turn the dial again. All this turning of the dial causes unnecessary delay and you would end up waiting for the camera to be ready to take photos again.

<I>Improved Autofocus Points Selection</I>

On the G2, switching between the different AF points can be a chore. To choose a particular AF point, you will need to push a button and then use the arrow dial to choose between the 3 AF points. Once the AF point of your choice is highlighted, just half-depress the shutter release button and the AF point will be selected. Thereafter, unless the whole process as described above is repeated, you will be stuck with the same AF point.

On the S40, once you have opted to choose your own AF point, you can assign different AF points from shot to shot by using the arrow buttons without having to go through the tedious task of pressing multiple buttons.

<I>Underwater Casing</I>

If that is important to you! Yes, finally you can go diving with the S40. I wonder why Canon did not make a similar case for the G2.

<B>Worse Than G2</B>

These are some of the functions/ features that are lacking compared to the G2.

<I>LCD</I>

I miss the swivelling LCD screen. On the S40 the LCD screen is fixed. That means I cannot take those shots from weird angles which I often do with the G2. I hate to lie flat on my tummy in the middle of the road to take those low angle shots!

<I>Battery Life</I>

With the G2, I can take almost 400 shots with the LCD on most of the time before the battery runs flat. Not so on the S40. I'd be lucky if I can take 250 shots. This is due to the smaller size of the battery in the S40. I guess you can't have it all. Because of the reduced size, something's got to give.

<I>Hotshoe</I>

If you are into night or indoor photography, the S40 will be a disappointment. The built in flash is simply insufficient in most situations. You can't even use an external flash with the S40 as not only does it not come with a hotshoe, there is also no flash terminal built in.

The G2, on the other hand, comes with a built in hotshoe that can take any of the EX flashes. Together, they produce some of the most incredible flash photography results I have ever had.

<B>Summary</B>

Pictures taken with the S40 are sharp and have good color and exposure. It is a wonder that such a small lens can produce such high quality photos. Although some features of the G2 are lacking in the S40, the latter has improved on some of the features it took from the G2. On balance, it should be considered almost an equal to the G2.
