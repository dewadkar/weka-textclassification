            I leased a 1998 Isuzu Rodeo LS 4WD, it has been nothing but headaches and trips to the dealer.  A quick laundry list of problems I have encountered:
-Cracked fuel injectors
-Defective ABS (twice)
-Defective air conditioning compressor
-Defective air bags
-Defective rear suspension
-Defective excitor ring on brakes(tells ABS how fast tires are spinning)
-Front hood clips defective
-Gas gauge defective
-Steering column defect
-Defective intake manifold gasket
-Defective starter
Understandably, I have tried to get out of my lease but Isuzu America was not at all interested in helping resolve these issues, they referred me to the Better Business Bureau.
The car also rattles, the brakes do not work reliably.  You must be prepared, at all times, for the brakes to push to the floor and the car to continue forward.
I would advise everyone not to buy or lease the Isuzu Rodeo, or any Isuzu product.<br><br>
