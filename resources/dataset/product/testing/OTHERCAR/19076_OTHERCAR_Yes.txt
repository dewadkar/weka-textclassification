            All around good product. I Have taken more good picture then ever before and at much less expense than my film cameras. No development cost. If you don't like the pictures you can just delete it or upload the pictures to your computer, open to full screen, crop, remove red eye, lighten/darken, change hew etc. etc. etc.. You can do so many things I could fill the page with all the great options the 2020 Zoom has. I haven't had an opportunity to try the 60 Sec video yet but I bet it's great, especially if it works like everything else has.
Go ahead buy it <br><br>
