            Digital camera's are great for any occasion.  I started selling items on Ebay a few months ago and I really needed a digital camera.  I took all my items down to my aunt's house one day to let her make pictures for me.  She had the Sony MVC-FD73.  I was amazed at all the great features it had and how easy it was to use.

I saved my online earnings and gift certificates I had earned and order me one from Amazon.  It arrived a few days ago and you would have thought I had gotten a new car, because I was sooooo excited.

At first site the Sony MVC-FD73 looks big, but it is light and very easy to hold.  It comes with a Lithium Ion battery, charging unit, lens cap cover, Arcsoft Software, and a shoulder strap.

Once out of the box I plugged up the battery to charge it.  It only took about 20 minutes and it was charged.  I inserted it into the camera and started taking pictures of my children.  The LCD screen makes it so easy to focus and get the right shot.  The 10x zoom lets you make great pictures from far away.  The battery has a life of up to 2.5 hours which is really great if you are away from home and can't charge it.  

The floppy disk will hold up to 25 photo's.  Once you are finished taking pictures just pop out the floppy disk and insert it into your computer.  You can upload the pictures to e-mail, wallpaper, auctions, and more.

You can also by extra accessories to go with your camera such as lens, filter kits, and carrying case.

I looked at many digital camera's before I decided on the Sony MVC-FD73 and I am very glad I bought the Sony MVC-FD73.  The main reasons I bought the Sony MVC-FD73 is because of the floppy disk storage feature and the rechargeable batteries.  I am sure it will be a great camera for many years.<br><br>
