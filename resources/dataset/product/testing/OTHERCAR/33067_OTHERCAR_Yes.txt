            So guess what I got??  A new Diamond White Cadillac Deville with neutral Shale leather interior.  It was really my husband�s idea.  He didn�t want another car that burned hi octane.  He was tired of paying the high prices.  It seemed like every luxury car we looked at used 92 octane, except the Cadillacs and other American made cars.   Another factor was that NO other car we looked at had the ride and feel of the Cadillac.  We�ve said it for years.  This is the third new one we got and they all rode and felt more comfortable than any other car we�ve ridden in � priced around the same price.  $40-50,000.  

Let me tell you about this one.  The DeVille has three models.  The standard, DHS, and DTS.  We got the Base Sedan.  The difference is not in the ride or the size, but in the extras.  The base sedan starts at around $42,500 and the DHS and DTS are more money.  There is more �foo-foo� on the outside.  They have the same body style, but the chrome and the bumpers and the trim make them look different. They also have more horsepower, but 275 is plenty for me. My favorite was the DTS, but it was waaaaaaaaaaay out of our price range. We sure like the looks of it.

The Deville comes with a 4.6VL, V8 with 275hp.  It has the northstar engine, which is suppose to last over l00,000 miles. This car is suppose to get l6 mph in town and 24 mph on the highway.  It will.   We never put that many miles on a car so we�ll probably never know.  It has frontwheel drive, Anti-lock braking system, 48 mos/50,000 bumper to bumper warranty.  It has front and side airbags in the front and side airbags in the back. It looks sharp with the l6� alloy wheels, and the �mercedes� bumper.  We saw the same car with different headlights and bumpers, but this one looks more like a mercedes.

Cadillac had a spring special.  Our model came with a �spring� package, which included a sunroof, the diamond white paint, and the driver memory.  It�s great.  You just program it from driver 1 to driver 2 and when you use the corresponding FOB, it automatically adjusts to the driver.  It can be programmed to honk and flash the lights when you lock it, to go to a neutral position when the motor is shut off, to automatically set the temperature, and the lock when the car is put in gear.  It can be customized for two different drivers. The car also has the lumbar seats.  This means you can adjust the lumbar position for the driver and passenger for more comfort on your back,andddddddd it comes with heat.

The clincher as far as I was concerned is that the front seat has TWO controls for the temperature.  One for the driver and one for the passenger.  My husband and I never like the temperature the same.  The back seat also has it�s own temperature and airconditioning control.

The Cadillac also comes with free �Onstar� tracking for a year, including 30 free minutes of �air� time on the hands free phone system that is operated through the radio.  I don�t know if we will continue with the telephone service since we have a cellphone, but the Onstar itself is worth having.

The colors for the DeVille are Sterling silver, Blue Onyx, Graphite, Cotillion White, Sable Black, Cabernet, Cashmere, Bronzemist, Crimson Pearl and White diamond, with five interior choices of Dark grey leather, Neutral Shale, Black leather, Midnight blue leather and Oatmeal leather.

The 2002 model is a little smaller than the 1994 that I had.  I like the size and the looks better on this one.  It handles and rides beautifully.  I can�t find one thing wrong with it.  Of course, I�m too happy to really look.
