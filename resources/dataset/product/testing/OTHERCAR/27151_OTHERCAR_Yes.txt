                 My family has owned 3 Astros in the past 11 years, and we've loved them all. The first was just a plain ol 88 that worked very well. My mom was the main driver, running around two kids and all their friends. We used it for several trips, towing a three place snowmobile trailer that weighs about 2700 pounds. It pulled it quite well.  

     We sold that and got a 92 All-wheel drive Astro with a 4.3 liter V-6. This van towed great and got us from Michigan to Florida in the &quot;Snowstorm of the Century&quot; of 95. We pulled off into 18 inches of snow at a rest stop and never got stuck. Quite impressive. The only problem we had was that the idler arm (steering component) needed replacing. This is a common problem on GM trucks and vans. I just had mine replaced on my 92 half-ton 4x4, but it did have 125,000 hard miles on it. Basically the problem comes from the fact that it never gets greased. To get to the ones in my truck you have to turn the wheel all the way for each one, and you have to go through the engine compartment to reach it. I know they don't do that at the 10 minute oil change places. 

    Two years ago we got the Astro we have now, a 98 All-wheel drive. With the Vortec 4.3 V-6 it sure gets up and goes. The sound system in this thing is actually decent compared to most cars I've seen. It could use more bass if you're into higher volume listening, but the cd player works great, even on scratched disks. The interior of this van is much nicer than the earlier versions. Everything has a nice, rounded-skulpted look to it. I really like it, it's a very nice vehicle inside.

     This van has absolutely no problem towing snowmobiles or our 18 foot boat. I really like this van and would recommened it to anyone. I can't think of anything that is bad about this van, it works great for everything that a van would be needed for. It tows great, gets decent milage (18-24) and is excelent in snow. I live in the middle of no where, and it is often 2 or 3 days before the snowplows get out to the roads by my house. Never gotten this van stuck.<br><br>
