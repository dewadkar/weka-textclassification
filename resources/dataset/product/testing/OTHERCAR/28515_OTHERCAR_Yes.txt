            I own a 1995 SAAB 900SE with a V-6 engine and have now done 73,000 miles in the car.  I find it to be a small, sporty, and economical car which averages 30 MPG on long runs and 23 in town.  It runs on regular gas and the engine produces 175 BHP.  It has been exceptionally reliable with only minor problems and swallows a vast quantity of luggage, even with the rear seat occupied.  As an ex-fighter pilot I find the ergonomics to be outstanding and the seats wonderfully comfortable.  As an example it takes 4 golf bags plus other luggage and if needed can be turned into a wagon by lowering the rear seat.  I have owned many Audis (CS Turbo, Coupe, 5000 diesel (ugh!) and 200) and this car outshines them all.  I bought this car to replace the Audis and will certainly replace it with a 9-3 when the time comes.  Having driven a 9-3 I find it to be somewhat improved without losing the finer points of the 900SE.<br><br>
