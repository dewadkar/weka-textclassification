            This is a great family van. Great for those sports playing families.  The bench seats are easy to remove and aren't overweight.  This van is good for hauling a lot of stuff around town.  It is quite powerful and has a lot of space for stuff in the back.  I haul boxes of old computer equipment for my office and all that primitive computer equipment can get pretty heavy.

This van is quite roomy and when there are passengers they have more than enough room if you aren't hauling half the soccer team.  It is also pretty comfortable.  Even though there are bench seats in the back they aren't that uncomfortable.  If you are going on a long trip the back isn't the ideal place to be but the back of any vehicle isn't the place to be.

My only complaint is that this van isn't very aerodynamic.  If it were a little bit sleeker it would get much better gas mileage.  I only get around 18 MPG for fuel economy so fuel bills can be a little on the high side but other than that this is a good van.<br><br>
