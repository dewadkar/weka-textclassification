            I have had Forester S, 2001 model for 8 months. What can I tell you? I love this car! Before I bought it I made extensive research among contenders such as small SUVs (RAV4, CRV, Grand Vitara and Xterra), medium size SUVs (4Runner, Passport) and family sedans (Camry and Maxima and Legacy Outback).

Since I live in NorthEast I eliminated sedans. My commute is 60 miles per day so I eliminated medium size SUVs (and Xterra) for gas mileage reasons. I eliminated RAV4 and CRV due to low horsepower.

So, I was left with Forester and Outback.
I did a test drive and didn��t like Outback right away �V it was underpowered compare to Forester due to higher weight (well, now they have V6 Outback so I would probably reconsider). And boy, when I test drove Forester I loved this car from first sight (first press on gas pedal &#131�). It is fast on highways, it almost eliminates road bumps, during 2 snowstorm I was laughing because I didn��t feel I was driving on snow!
I definitely recommend this car for that money ($22500 S model with mirror, air filter, and differential protector and luggage cover) but I would probably buy V6 outback if it was available at that time.

One thing I would like to advise Subaru engineers: make V6 available for Forester and also dynamic skid control. These features are available for Outback.
Cheers!

11 months update: Got check engine light, according to dealer due to using aftermarket locking gas cap. Replaced it with original one and light disappeared. Put back aftermarket cap and still there is no "check engine light"
Probably minor quirk.

June 2002 update:
Got letter from Subaru that I need to take it to a dealler to reprogram computer, something related to "Check Engine" lite. 

Winter 2002/2003 update:
During snowstorms in North East my Forester again confirmed that I made a right choice: if was cruising easily on snow. It was so funny: my 23K car was zooming on the road when 50K+ Mercedes could not even move!
Highly Recommend!
