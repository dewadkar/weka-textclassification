            As a mother of 6, I absolutely love this S.U.V.  I feel like I'm too young to be driving a mini-van, but had no other alternative... until now.  This vehicle fits my entire family(more comfortably that the mini-van) and now I can feel stylish... more my age.  It's compact enough that I'm not afraid to back up in it.  Also, it's nice that the kids can get into the car from both sides of the vehicle.  It keeps them from having to wait for each other at the &quot;sliding door&quot; on the mini-van.  Anything that eliminates arguments is a GOOD thing!!!  We also have horses, and this baby really pulls!!!  Talk about getting everything we needed in one package.  Thanks Dodge!!<br><br>
