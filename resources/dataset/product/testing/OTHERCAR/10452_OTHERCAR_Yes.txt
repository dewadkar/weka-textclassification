            I bought an Acura Integra about a year and a half ago and i have been nothing but happy about it the whole time. It's performance is amazing with great acceleration and decent handling, but what is really great about this car is that it takes very little maintenance to keep it on the road. In the year and a half that i have owned the car, i have only had to change the oil and nothing else. I have already put 40,000 miles on this used 1995 Integra and that is all that i have had to do. The book also recommends that you don't have to change the oil but every 7,500 miles. It is really a great car and will also keep its value when i trade it in for something else later, but it should be much later as i don't think i want to part with it.
