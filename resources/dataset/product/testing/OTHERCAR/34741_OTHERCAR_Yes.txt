            Ah, my 1997 Passat TDI Wagon. The reasons I bought this for vehicle: Fuel Mileage, at 40+ mpg it can't be beat for a car this size. With a 18 gallon main fuel tank and a 6 gallon reserve you have a cruising distance of appx. 750 miles. This is truly a low maintainence vehicle, as long as you wait for the glow plug light to go out when you are starting they should last at least 150,000 miles. I also recommended that you idle the car for a few minutes after a long drive for a few minutes in your parking space so that the turbo charger can cool down, this will only save you money in the long run.
The car is great, it is truly a family car with true seating for 5 plus plenty of storage in the rear. The car has plenty of safety features, DRL's, Dual Airbags, Tether Straps and 4 wheel Disc ABS, which is all very nice when you go to visit your Insurance Agent. The car is steel not plastic, solidly engineered. Volkswagens hold there value!
Some not so great things, there is no acceleration from a dead stop, again its a diesel wagon not a race car though. On the highway it gets right up and goes though. Heat, as with most diesels it takes awhile for the heat to kick up and into the cabin.
Please let me explain some things about VW, there are German VW's and Brazilian/Mexican VW's, do yourself a favor find a Wolfsburgh Edition if you can, these cars are made in Germany. The others are German engineered and put together in South America and they really lack the quality of the true German VW's.
You should expect 300,000 miles from this engine if taken care of correctly, examples oil changed every 3000 miles, you can't slack up on changing the oil in this car. Glow plugs, again wait for the light to go out or you will blow them and they can be expensive. The shift point for this car is 2000 rpm not 3000 like a gas engine take care that you are not over reving the engine.
All in all, this is a great car for the family and if taken care off you should have it for a long time. <br><br>
