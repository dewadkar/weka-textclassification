            I sell Hondas and was shocked when I looked at this car for the first time.  Lets talk about what Honda improved from last years car.  First of all every model except the ex got a horsepower boost (the ex got a torque boost).  Most of the time when this happens the gas mileage goes down, not in this car in fact it increased the gas mileage on all models of the civic across the board.  One of the things I love about this car even though it is compact by government standards, you can easily fit a six footer in the rear of this vehicle.  One of the big changes is the flat rear floor in this car(no hump in the middle), which allows the middle rear passenger a huge amount of legroom.  The stereo in this car is heads and tails better than last years model as well (more power, better clarity).  Build quality on this car is fantastic, the gaps and seams are much tighter than last years car cutting down wind noise and rattles are non existant.  Safety on this car is 5 star for the front impacts and 4 star for side impacts on the sedan, the coupe is 5 star for side impacts.  Side impact airbags are available on all models this year as well.  Honda added microchip keys to help lower theft on new civics as well.  This is just the beginning of the new features on this car.  Honda reliability and resale value will come into play making this car the best choice to buy when compared to the competition.  The focus, corolla, and sentra are leagues behind this car.  Best of all it only went up $100 from last years msrp.
