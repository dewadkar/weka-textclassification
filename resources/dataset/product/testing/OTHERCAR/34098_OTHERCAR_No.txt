            I bought my '92 Rose Silver Lincoln new.  What a beauty!  Great color (I've only seen one other like it in our area), small enough for me and big enough for my husband.  All was fine for about a year.  Then some mysterious ailment struck!  I had it into the shop every week or so but of course it acted fine there so over the next 10 months I gradually figured out it was something with the brakes!  Turned out to be the brake booster - but luckily that was covered under the warranty.  There were some other problems while it was still under warranty but nothing &quot;MAJOR&quot;.  Those came after the warranty expired!!

I have replaced the air conditioner, the alternator, both rear air suspensions, and most recently a head gasket.  The car only has 80,000 miles and is serviced regularly every 3,000 miles.  I'm still driving it because every time I fix another $1500 worth or so, I feel I need to get my money's worth.  I'm hoping nothing else expensive will go wrong before I get my new car which I am looking for now!!

The car is very comfortable and drives nicely although I think the AC is inadequate at times in our hot climate.  There are no rear air vents and no drink holder.  I get an average 21 mpg (city/country) but I have to use premium gas or the engine pings.<br><br>
