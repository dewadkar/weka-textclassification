            I love this truck!  It has all the power and torque I need and then some!

I needed a truck for the business and the Chevy 2500 extended cab with 5.7 liter was just a bit too small, so I opted for the crew cab instead, and rightly so!


The finer points include the 454 big block, which has more power than I will ever need, and also the tranny (hd) which has its own cooler.  Also, the dash is quite easy to read, the controls/knobs are easily accessible.  The 4.10 rear end is perfect for a vehicle this size.  The 8 foot long bed suits me and my equipment just fine as well.

On the improvements, there aren't much to be addressed, but here goes:  a vehicle of this size should have dual tanks rather than the single 34 gallon tank, and the radiator coolant recovery tank is somewhat less than ideal(it tends to &quot;weep&quot; every so often, leaving coolant at the top of the reservoir).  Also, the stock shocks are somewhat on the soft side (the front end tends to bob up and down more than necessary).  Also, the front end sits 2 to 3 inches lower than the rear end--this could be due to the springs--why can't Chevy lift the front end a bit from the factory?
Finally, the audio speakers are somewhat less than ideal, since even at just a bit more than 1/2 full volume, the speakers distort on many sorts of music.

Anyway, that's my take on the 2000 Chevy Crew Cab with the 454 motor.  I definitely would recommend this truck to anyone that hauls big stuff on a regular basis (either people or equipment, or a mix of both).  It is a comfortable, stable, and smooth ride altogether!
