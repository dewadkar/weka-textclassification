            In case you haven't read my opinion of car salesmen these days, I haven't had too much fun dealing with them lately.  I decided to give Saturn a try.  I have owned two used Saturns in the past, both SL1.  I leased a Saturn SL2 today because of the price.  It was a great deal.  I love the color and the gas mileage I will be enjoying again as I did with my other Saturns.

A lot of people worry about the room, but I'm pretty tall and have plenty of room.  The driver's seat will actually raise and lower in height.

If you want a car that gets great gas mileage and has a great price, give the Saturn SL2 a try.  I know you'll like what you find.  

Oh yeah, the salesman was great too.  He answered our questions and was courteous in every way.<br><br>
