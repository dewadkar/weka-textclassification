            Before I received this camera (birthday gift), I previously used a 640x480 digital that I got free from Earthlink when I signed on. So the Elph S100 was a major upgrade. 

For me, the feature that put the S100 over all of the other cameras I tested in the stores and read about online, was the physical size of the camera. What makes having a digital camera so cool is the fact that you can take it everywhere you go and snap all you want and never have to worry about the cost of film or processing. And with the size of this camera, carrying it around with you everywhere you go is a breeze.

And with that size, Canon hasn't skimped on any features. The LCD screen and controls for the menu system are nicely integrated and relatively easy to use.

The only drawback I've come across is the 8mb card that ships with the camera. You can't get the number of pics you want with a card this small. (Unless you're always using the 640x480 resoultion, and if you are, why buy an expensive 2.1 megapixel camera?) 

I was expecting that I would like the Elph s100, but it has far exceeded all of my expectations.
