            My wife and I went looking for a car for her to drive so she could go back to work. We walked past this thing three times before stopping. They take a little getting used to, but we've had it for over a year now and she still loves it. Yes it is small and has a choppy ride on the highway, but man is it easy to park and turn around. Fit and finish on interior and exterior are way above the normal for a car carried by GM. We actually used it as our only means of transportation with 2 kids for about 6 months. No fooling around with electronic 4wd switches either. Good old pull it and go lever shifting here. A/C and climate controls also work good. Transmission shifts smooth(automatic) and the stereo is above average for a cheap vehicle. Carpet is very thin and inexpensive as is expected in a vehicle of this quality and price. Although this is 2003, you can still find these left over in the back corners of dealer's lots. Trouble with that is it shows they don't sell well. If you look at a used one(especially a 4 door) chances are it was in fleet rental service. Look it over good, cause a very large percentage of ex-rental vehicles have had body repair done to them
