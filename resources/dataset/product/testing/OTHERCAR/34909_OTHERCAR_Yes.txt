            I used to drive Toyota's Previa.  I loved the minivan, but it was getting old.  As Previa is no longer offered in the US, I looked at its successor, Sienna.  I was not impressed.  It looked too small. Then, a friend of mine recommended the new Honda Odyssey, which she purchased not long before.  I looked at it and fell in love with it.  Unlike most other minivans, it looks &quot;cool.&quot;  Now I have my own new Odyssey.  I am perfectly happy with it.  It is very roomy.  It is much more powerful than Previa.  The two automatic sliding doors are fun and elegant.  The way the rear seat is folded and tucked into the sunken space is ingenious.  It is really easy to change the configuration, too.  I trust it has the established reliability of Honda.  The leather seats (an option I went for) offer a luxurious feel inside the minivan.  I am looking forward to taking a camping trip in this minivan this summer!!<br><br>
