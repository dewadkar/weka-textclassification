            This is one smooth car on the inside and out.  The 2001 Lincoln LS has more features than I have seen on any car.  I own a Durango and a Corvette so this was quite a change for me.  My boss bought the 2001 Lincoln LS as a company car for his business in Florida.  He checked into Jaguar and BMW also but chose the Lincoln for the sporty look and great price (compared to others sport/luxury cars).  I was very pleasantly surprised with the power and performance after driving this car for various short trips and then a 2 hour trip.

This car has all of the standard luxury features such as leather interior, power seats, locks, mirrors, and windows.  Fold down rear seat for extra trunk or cargo space.  Security system and anti theft devices.  The 6 disc CD changer is great and the sound quality is awesome! There is even a mute button on the steering wheel which is nice when you get a phone call or just need to quickly cut the music off. This Lincoln also features automatic headlights that come on as soon as the sun begins to fade.   

It has Automatic Seat settings.  It has 2 settings that you program for the 2 main drivers of the car.  Everytime you turn off the key, the seat will go back and the steering wheel will go up to allow you extra room for getting out and back in the drivers seat.  Then when you reinsert the key, it will take you back to your memorized settings.    

The dash board has digital readings for everything from gas consumption, to the outside temperature.  All of the dash controls are easily reachable and simple to operate.  The seats are extremely comfortable with an added bonus of power lumbar.  The 2001 Lincoln LS provides an extremely quiet ride and give you an average gas milege of about 18 miles per gallon.

The exterior is sleek and sporty.  If you are looking for an eye catching luxury car, this is the one.  It has plenty of power, with all the comfort of a traditional Lincoln. Although this is a smaller sportier model, there is plenty of leg room in the back seat and a very large trunk area.

There have been no mechanical problems with this car in the 2 months that we have had it.  If you are checking out new cars in the mid 30 price range, this would definately be worth your time to test drive.
