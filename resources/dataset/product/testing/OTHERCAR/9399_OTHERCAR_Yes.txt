            The Jetta is a nice car to look at, but its not really the best car in its class.  The seats are very uncomfortable. The gas pedal is right in the center as opposed to offset to the right like most cars.  And the brake pedal is very close to the gas pedal too, causing for accidental breaking sometimes.  It just takes a little bit of getting used to. The good point about this car is that it does have a full sized spare. I do not think the quality of this car is as good as the name. During the first week I had the car, the sunroof already started to malfunction.  It would randomly open by itself.  And often times did not work at all when I tried to open it. Also, the dash is in an ugly purple or blue color.  It does not match the rest of the car's electrical components.<br><br>
