            I bought my Saturn back in 1995 from Saturn of West Sahara, Las Vegas.  My husband and I researched for over a year about the various compact vehicles on the market, and Saturn kept coming up at the best choice.  We bought the SL1 and drove it to our new home in Florida (after making a pit stop in Virginia and New York.  Long story :) ).  The car has been a delight.  It gets good gas mileage and I never have to worry about it breaking down.  It has only had one major problem (with the clutch) that I had to make an unscheduled stop at the shop.  It was fixed and I have not had any problems since.  I do make sure to take it in for regular maintenance, which I think is the key to making sure any car will last.

The dealership we purchased at, Saturn of West Sahara, Las Vegas, was also terrific.  We received such good service there that we even seriously thought about flying back out there when we got our new Saturn.  We decided to give our local dealership a chance... not as great as LV, but still better than other car dealerships out there (Ford, Mazda, etc.).  We just purchased our second Saturn this year... and it looks to be a winner also.<br><br>
