            <b>Where did I buy this one?</b>
I bought mine used from Infiniti of Gwinnett two months ago. It had 14,429 miles and we made a deal for $24000 drive out. Options on this car included the sun n' shade package which gives you power sunroof and power rear sunshade. It also has the winter package which includes heated seats and heated mirrors. The car also comes standard with Xenon Headlights (Nice Touch).

<b>Infiniti Dealer Treatment</b>
For the price I paid, I consider this to be an excellent choice. The infiniti dealers are also very good. From the moment I walked into the dealership, I was promptly greeted and a helpful sales person was assigned to me. She answered all my questions about several cars without pushing me to buy any particular car.

<b>Great Sound System</b>
The car comes equipped with a 200-Watt Bose cassette and 6 CD in-dash changer which produces rich sound to indulge your senses. The CD player is capable of playing High quality music CDR disks. Overall this a great sound system.

<b>Transmission Rants and Raves</b>
The car comes with a 4-speed automatic, which works great. The transmission shifts smoothly and you won't notice its operation most of the time. However infiniti need to consider that all of their competitors i.e. Lexus ES300, Acura TL come with 5-Speed automatic transmissions. Also for such a great engine, they should have dual Exhausts like the Lexuses do. It makes the car look more menacing then it does now.

<b>The famous VQ block 3.5L 255HP engine</b>
Well, I can't say enough about this awesome piece of machinery. It's silky smooth in operation and packs a whallop at the same time. Punch the accelerator and you will be sticking to your seat back for a while as the car leaves behind everyone at the red light. The engine is so quiet on idle that more than once I have forgotten that it is on and tried to turn the key only to be greeted by a screech that told me it is on. This engine truly deserves its designation of world's top qo engines. 

<b>AC Rants and Raves</b>
The Auto Climate control does what it is suppose to do very efficiently. The only complaint here is that Infiniti does not have Rear AC in this car, while all of their competitor's have them standard. Besides these shortcomings, it is a great car for the price.

<b>Interior and Trunk</b>
Leather seats are soft and comfortable to sit on for long periods of time. Heated seats are a nice touch for winter time. Only shortcoming here is that they use too much plastic and FAKE wood around the dash and center console. Instead they should use REAL wood and more of it around the dash to make the car look more luxurious.

<b>Driving Impressions</b>
Now that I have spent ample amount of time driving this car both on city streets and highway, I present to you my thoughts on drivability of this car. On highway speeds [read: 80mph and above] the ride is well balanced and smooth. Some car magazines say that the handling of this car is "ho-hum", which is not true. I have driven this car enough through tight turns and curvy roads in North Georgia mountains and have concluded that it handles extremely well. During city driving [read: stop and go traffic around 25-50mph], the car maintains a smooth ride while still keeping the driver (me) alert about the road [read: steering feedback is Excellent]. 

Throughout my 2 months of driving I have averaged 26 MPG combined for city and highway driving which is very good considering it is a 3.5L V6. Compare it to my 1998 4-cylinder Honda Accord that used to give me 24-26MPG average for the same amount of driving.

<b>Conclusion</b>
Great car for the money and if Infiniti fixes the problems I have mentioned above, they would not have any trouble selling them like hot cakes.
