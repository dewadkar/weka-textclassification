            Anyone can write an epinion on a minivan verbatim from the owners manual.(Not to hard to do) But, I am going to share with you more useful information - for those of you who are looking into buying this vehicle as a family vehicle-as I did.

First I would like to say that it took a lot to get me to even look at minivans in general. (I was never a big fan of the appearance of them) But, out of complete necessity I started to consider it the answer to my transportation problem. The main problem being my car seat dilemma. Three car seats do not fit correctly across the backseat of many cars.  We (my husband and I) were expecting our second child and we currently had a foster child living with us.  So in the event that I wanted to leave my house, after the baby was born, I would need to take them all with me.(Although why I would want to leave my house with 3 children under 3 and go anywhere I hadn't figured out)

So we looked at minivans (and boy did we look!)  We test drove so many minivans that I was so sick of driving.  At first I was really scared of test driving a brand new minivan, I was very use to small cars(GEO STORM).  But, to my surprise most of the minivans drove very similar to a car and you are lower to the ground than it appears. I was right at home driving them. (With the exception on the FORD WINDSTAR - I thought that one drove like a truck - a very mechanical feeling) One hand for the steering wheel the other for my coffee - no fears!)

The reason we decided on the MAZDA MPV was - where do I begin!  I feel in love with it in the showroom before the test drive! But, on the test drive I found out just how easy it was to drive.  I thought I was going to have a hard time being so used to driving small cars.  It was easy to handle and felt very similar to driving a car. 

The Mazda MPV is a 4 door vehicle - this was a selling feature for a mom with 3 kids(In out In out).  The two doors in the front are standard doors while the 2 in the back are sliding doors.  The sliding doors have weights in them to stay open and not slide shut on you.  This is great for those times when it takes me longer than usual to lift my 16 lb son in his carseat/carrier to the base on the seat or when my daughter is taking her own sweet time getting in.

I loved the fact that the third seat (3 seatbelts) in the back could either fold right down into the minivan or be removed for extra storage.  I thought that was super for those times when I wanted to go to the grocery store and not take all the children.  I could flip the seat down and have more room for bags.  I also didn't have to fight with taking the seat out, putting it somewhere only to have to put it back later.  (And with the seat in I still have enough storage space to fit the double stroller plus about 5 grocery bags)

Another great seat feature is the second row of seats   
(2 seatbelts).  Not only are they removable also, but they slide together and apart very easily. (So they can form a 2 captains seats or 1 bench style seat)This is great for the days when your getting a lot of the "She's touching me " & "He took my book ". Easy solution - now they can't reach eachother. Another feature of the second row seats is that when they are folded down they have a table surface on the back so the people in the 3rd row seats have a table.  (Great for road trips - kids in the back can color or play cards)

The 2nd and 3rd row of seats also have tinted windows so you won't have to hear "The suns in my eyes! Where are my sunglasses?" (and of course they expect that you will just pull over and find them right away- right!) This is also a great feature for times when you new moms need to nurse your little ones or change a diaper. (The third row seat is perfect for a diaper table in a pinch - long and flat)Not only is there ample room to nurse your baby or change a diaper but, the sun won't be in their eyes or yours.  

Other great features for MOM or DAD are the controls up front.  Standard single C.D&/Tape player, Temperture control for the front or the car and the rear of the car, Sunglass holder, Garage door control holder, storage compartment  and my favorite feature - the double cup holder that pulls out from the front drivers right side.  This is a great feature because it can adjust to fit 3 sizes of cups. Speaking of cup holders there are also cup holders in the doors for the 2nd row of seats and next to the windows in the back for the 3rd row of seats. The 3rd row actually has 2 on each side.  My daughter loves this because she has a space for her snack as well as her drink for long rides.

In closing this is a vehicle that will grow with your families needs for space.  A wonderful minivan with a smooth ride and comfortable seating arrangements for the whole family.

Have Fun!
