            I've had my '98 Mazda Protege just over a month now.  I bought it after months of research, primarily because Consumer Reports frequently rated it a best buy.  I spent many hours online at "used cars for sale" sites, and this particular car was a stand-out:  50,000 miles/$4,500.  I bought it from a graduate student who LOVED it and hated having to give it up, but she was leaving the U.S.

I love the very precise steering and the overall solid feel of this car.

However, here's what I hate about it:

The defrosters are poor, with the rear window defroster minimally effective.

The power window controls are just plain bizarre:  you push them down to lower, but must pull up one edge to raise them -- guess how awkward this is for a woman with even slightly long nails.

I found that the visibility seems to have been designed for a short person.  I'm 6' tall and noted that the side mirrors are planted at a crucially poor spot; then I scrunched down and found out they are positioned ideally for a shorter torso.

Often this winter, getting the Mazda up my steep driveway has been hopeless, in conditions that my old '92 Cavalier took with ease.

AND IT MAY SOUND TRIVIAL, BUT WORST OF ALL:  the driver must push the turn signal lever forward to activate the brights, which requires taking one hand off the wheel!  I live in a rural area with no street lights, so one must use the brights very frequently.  It's SO awkward and ill-conceived, it drives me nuts.
