            I didn�t even know that they were making GMC �Suburbans�, but let me tell you this thing is a hoss.  It <i>feels</i> like the Cadillac Escalade to drive (with great comfort) and a Z71 pickup with power.  I didn�t know that you could use <b>�GMC� and �elegant�</b> in the same sentence.  As you might guess by this intro, I was quite impressed.

I�m not going to give you a run down of all the typical goodies.  You can find that on any car website.  But I will hit the highlights.

They included the ONSTAR system on this one (from Cadillac) adding some extra safety and extravagant concierge features.

The BOSE stereo is incredible for a truck.  You might think you were in a Seville.

The ride is completely different.  I love trucks.  But I fully expected this one to rock and sway like most.  It didn�t.  It has quick acceleration and great braking.  The seats you could live.  All seats, including the most rearward extra seat is very comfortable.  On this one, the mid seats are split like captain�s chairs.  

This is an incredible family vehicle.  While the gas mileage is better than before, it still requires good relations with the Middle East.  However, the space you get is well worth the extra fuel and finally you don�t have to trade big space for a soft ride.
