            I bought my van used in 2002 with about 89000 miles on it. Here is a list of things I like about it

-dual sliding doors. VERY helpful when you have 2 kids in carseats

-Middle seats are captians, not bench. Very nice because the kids can't poke, prod and otherwise touch each other.

-running boards, makes it easy for he kids to get into the van without much help

-information panel up top gives a lot of useful information such as outside temperature, miles traveled, miles left to go on current gas, gas mileage, etc

-back and middle seats removable. We fit 2 full size bikes in the back and still had the middle seats in.

-smooth drive, I feel special up above all the little sedans

-power driver seat. Very nice when you and your husband are a full 12 inches different in size. I can adjust the seat without sitting in it

-Air/heat vents through out the van, with seperate controls.

-Roomy

-great gas mileage'

-plenty of power, I can take on a ford truck any day

Things I do not like :

-if the battery dies for some reason you have to take the van to the dealership and pay over $100 for the electronics to be re done because all the electronics go haywire (air won't work, lights blink on and off, windshield wipers go crazy)

And that is the ONLY thing I do not like.

I got great deal on this van (I think)and if I had to do it again I would. I have not had any problems other than the battery problem (once) and I have owned it 18 months now. It's great on short trips as well as long ones. I am very pleased
