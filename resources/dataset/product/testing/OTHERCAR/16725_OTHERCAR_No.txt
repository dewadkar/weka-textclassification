            I bought my 1993 Dodge Caravan in January 2001. Luckily, less than a month later a lady ran a red light and totaled it. This was the worst buying decision of my life. My husband and I wanted an affordable, used minivan and the Caravan seemed perfect. The interior was nice, and even the body wasn't too ugly for an older vehicle. A couple of days after buying it I started to notice the problems. The transmission would stick between park and reverse, the emergency brake required a miracle to release it, the radio would fade in and out, I had to pay a small fortune to have two new motor mounts put on it. In addition to all these mechanical problems the ride was really bumpy, the very back seat was too cramped for even small children, and the ride was very noisy.
Since this lady totaled the van, my insurance paid it off (she had no insurance), and I could not be more relieved. I would never recommend this vehicle to anyone. It is poorly made and expensive to repair.
