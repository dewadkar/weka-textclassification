            My first digital camera was a Fuji dx-9 and it was a good one. It was hard to beat the features of it with other 640x480 cameras. It served its purpose.....photos for my web site and then the newness wore off. Enter the Sony MVC-FD81. I looked around for a while for another camera with Lithium ion batteries and a optical zoom but could not find one until a friend of mine told me of a friend of his who had a used FD81 for sale. He had just upgraded and I got the FD81 for $280! Yeah that's right $280 and it looks like it just came out of the box. I LOVE this camera. I bought a 4 hour battery to go along with the 2 hour battery and I must say.... I can't possible run it down. I get tired of taking pictures before I use all the power up. The Quality of the pictures are good. Close up shots are GREAT, while far off shots seem good but not as good as I would like. I'm sure most Cameras under 1.3 megapixels are the same way.
I hope sometime soon to upgrade to a megapixel Sony but for now I am VERY happy with this one. The mpg's are great for v-mail. I give this camera 4 out of 5 stars.<br><br>
