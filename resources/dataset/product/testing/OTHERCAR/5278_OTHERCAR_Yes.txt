            Why a Honda Accord?  You could purchase a Ford Taurus or Toyota Camry for the same price or less, but if you enjoy driving, the Honda Accord is the right choice.  I recently owned a black 98 Honda Accord EX four-door (traded in for an Acura Integra) which I believe is the best value in the compact sedan market.  

Reliability?  You got it, the Accord will match the Camry and hold it's resale value.  Performance?  The 2.3 liter V-TEC engine is powerful and spins smoothly and quietly; matched with a slick manual transmission, it'll get you from point A to B surprisingly quick. Handling?  The Accord is amazingly light on it's feet, soaking up the bumps but providing enough feedback to let you know that you are driving...  Ergonomics?  The seats are firm and comfortable, all the controls fall easily to hand and check out the sunglass holder!  Fuel efficiency?  You will get 30+ miles to the gallon and meet California's strict emissions requirements.  

Toss in Honda's robust engineering and one of the roomiest interiors/trunks in it's class and you've got yourself the winner.  (Though in all honesty, you wouldn't go wrong if you chose the Taurus or Camry)  What are the negatives?  The Accord is built in Ohio and I don't think the build quality is quite up to snuff to Japanese built models (but still better than 95% of the cars out there).  The interior is a bit bland looking in grey cloth.  You also have to get used to seeing another Honda Accord every 50 feet or so; it's one of the best-selling models in the US.  But if I were in the market for a four-door sedan for my family (and still enjoyed driving), the Honda Accord would be the obvious choice!
