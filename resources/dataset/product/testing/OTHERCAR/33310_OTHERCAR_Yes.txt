            I currently own a 1998 Forester and am extremely happy with my choice.  After a long search, and countless hours of web time, I decided on the Forester as my next automobile purchase.

My initial attraction was to the price and gas mileage.   Most SUV's have horrible gas mileage!  I knew I could not expect economy car MPG's but sure hoped to find something better than single digits.  I am averaging in the low 20's on the highway which is great because I travel quite a bit in my current position.  As for price, fair.   I found only one other SUV with a lower base price, but many more models with higher stickers!

I can honestly say there is little I dislike about my Forester.  If I were forced to say something, it might be that the manual lumbar support is not all that great.  But hey, if that is the worst thing I can come up with, it might not even be worth mentioning!!

The Forester is definitely worth the test drive.<br><br>
