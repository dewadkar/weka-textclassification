            I've owned a MVC FD-71 Sony Mavica Digital Camera for about a year and a half now. Compared to some newer Sony models, such as the FD-73, the FD-71 is a bit superior in a few ways. One major advantage is that the FD-71 allows you to zoom in and focus manually, which you cannot do on the FD-73. I use this feature quite a bit to get detailed close ups of items which I sell on computer auctions. I believe there are some other minor differences with Sony's other less expensive models, but I'm not sure what they are. 

But here's some gripes I have with this camera... (some are just with this model itself, and others are with my own FD-71)

1. The FD-71 only has one way of getting your pictures onto your computer. It's via a 3.5&quot; floppy disk. That's just fine and convenient until you buy a newer computer which doesn't have a 3.5&quot; disk drive or bring the camera over someone else's house and find out they don't have one either. THERE SHOULD BE AT LEAST ONE MORE WAY OF GETTING PICS OUT OF THIS CAMERA.

2. My FD-71 seems to have a problem in higher humidity climates. During the hazy New England summers, Only about 80% of my pictures work. The other 20% say &quot;corrupted&quot; until I use a disk cleaner. This only works for a short while until I get errors again. Not sure what the problem is, but I've tried everything, including new and different disks. (these pictures show as corrupted on the camera's viewer as well as my computer).

3. The camera's viewer does not work well in high sunlight. It's very difficult to know what you're actually seeing in the viewer when you're outside. Have you ever tried watching TV outside in the sun? Furthermore, it's extremely difficult to get any subtle definition when taking pictures of dark items when you're inside using incandescent, florescent, or the built-in flash on the camera.

4. The Sony extended warrantee is a COMPLETE farce.  Sony gives you a 1 year warrantee when you buy the camera. If you've mailed in all your warrantee / registration paperwork to Sony, a third-party repair service sends you an extended 3 year warrantee offer, which is WAY overpriced. Only problem is, it's not for 3 years. It's really 2 additional years past the one year you've already owned it. I refused their extended repair offers several time, then, 1 month after my 1 year warrantee expired, the third-party repair service called me and offered me the same extended service for a MUCH reduced price of $125.00. Anyway, this company did the usual standard mess-up and billed my credit card the higher price of $300.+ and put in the wrong dates of my extended service. I had to call them several times and give them the whole story several times until they finally agreed on what I had purchased. Of course, I have not received anything in writing as of this day. WHAT DIRT BAGS!!!

5. In my opinion, deleting a picture has WAY too many steps involved. This should be a 2 step process at most, but unfortunately the folks at Sony think it should be several more. If you know the picture you just took stinks, then you should be able to delete it as quickly as you took it. What you are forced to do here is: 

A. Wait for the bad picture to copy onto the internal hard drive (6 seconds of wasted time).
B. Put the camera into play mode (2 seconds of more waisted time). 
C. Go into &quot;Menu&quot; and press the cursor button up 3 times to get to the &quot;Delete&quot; mode (5 more seconds of wasted time). 
D. Press on &quot;Delete&quot;. 
E. Hit the cursor up once more to &quot;OK&quot;. 
F. Press on &quot;OK&quot;.  (wait 6 more seconds for it to erase the picture you didn't even want) 
G. Once deleted, the camera stays in the normal &quot;Play&quot; mode, so you have to manually switch it back to &quot;Camera&quot; mode and wait until it's ready to shoot again (5 more lousy seconds of my valuable time wasted!!!) 

Why should this be sooo difficult??? Shouldn't it be quick and automatically go into &quot;Camera&quot; mode after deleting the picture? Ugh!!! What a huge waste of time. God, I hope they fixed this on later models.

Okay, I guess it sounds like I hate this camera. I really don't. I actually kinda like it, along with many other Sony products. And I think overall this camera has been surprisingly sturdy. After all, it does have a portable super high-speed disk drive built into a little plastic camera. Whoa! The thing that gets me, though, is how much it cost when I bought it ($650.00) vs. what it's worth today ($250.00). I knew I'd see it for much less in several months, and I did!  I probably should have waited a few more years until the technology improved and prices came down, but we needed a camera to sell on eBay.  I guess I can say I'm not sorry I bought it but I wish I had waited, and I wish Sony had put some more thought into it before they rushed it to market.

I hope this helps you.
