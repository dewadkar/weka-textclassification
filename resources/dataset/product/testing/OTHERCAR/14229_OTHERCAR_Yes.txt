            The QV-2000 takes great pictures. Has good array of features, zoom, 2.1 mpixels, fairly easy software however software is somewhat multistep to use. There's download, library software and then adobe email, transfer software. It takes up a lot of space on the computer. I only take hi resolution pics, and the battery life for this is probably 50 pics at most. There is no Lithium  ion option which probably has better life.

Size of camera is good and confortable. Cost is a good feature, use killerapp.com and can find for less than $500, which is a decent price for a megapixel camera with zoom. All in all, very satisfied, just have to replace those batteries a lot. Also, 24meg card allows about 25 hi resolution pics, the standard 8 meg card limits you to 8 pics.
