                 As the owner of two Nissan products, I must say that it is almost for certain that I will own some more Nissan products in my lifetime.  Like our long lived Nissan Sentra, our Maxima (1999 model) has been one of the best additions to our family.  We have put just over 20,000 miles on it since we purchased it last June.   Not only is it beautiful to look at, but a very smooth ride to say the least.

     My Father and Grandfather have always been against non-American made cars, but in the case of my Maxima, but have said they would not mind owning the car.   The gas mileage is above what I would expect for a low cost luxury vehicle of it's size.  We get an average of between 25 and 27 miles per gallon for highway miles.

     We have had very few problems with our Maxima.  The biggest concern that we have had is the paintjob.  It seems that our Maxima is getting more scratches in it's short life than it should.  Besides that little fact, we have not had any other problems worth mentioning.

     If you are looking for a car that will keep you happy for many years to come, the Nissan Maxima is more than worth the money.<br><br>
