            This car is exactly what I expect from a car: precise handling, stiff sporty suspension, amazing acceleration for seemingly small 1.6l engine, four wheel disc brakes...

I found this not so well known car accidently, I was looking for a car in a used car dealership, tried some others but then my sight fell on this Stylus. It looked attractive and the price was right and after a test drive I just liked it.

I am using this car for my everyday commuting and have also made some long drives: like from LA to Seattle and back. It was a nice trip despite of the long driving hours and the car performed very well.

I have to mention that Stylus feels kind of rough: it is no a luxury car by any means, and the engine may get noisy, especially above 4000 rpm which it reaches at 80 mph in 5th gear. However, it is quite dynamic and powerful at this rpms and accelerates nicely.
