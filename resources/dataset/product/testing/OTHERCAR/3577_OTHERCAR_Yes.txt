            Most of the opinions you will find here deal with technical issues. This one focuses on the experience driven by the dream of a lifetime for this epinions member. Hope you like it.

You have an eye for great images. You know there is an artist inside of you. You hate to waste time and money developing and printing pictures that fall short of your expectations? You think SLR cameras are just too complicated? Or perhaps you are like me, a combination of all previous things, plus the added factor that patience is not a word in our vocabulary.

I dont know much about cameras nor photography in itself, but I do know that I love visual stimulation. And photography to me is like a vocation that is surrounded by frustration and achievement alike. Lets just say that of every 200 pictures I take, only 2 may be considered great pics, while the rest linger between mediocrity and average quality trash.

The very little I have learned in photography has been using a Canon EOS Rebel, something that is far from being a top notch camera. To me, the camera is just the means of getting that elusive but coveted image in your mind and turning it into reality, bringing it to life.

Canon, via its incredible G2 Camera, has made my dream possible. Do you know how much it means for me to see those "perfect pictures" suddenly materialize with such frequency and consistency on my printer? It is simply amazing.

How does the G2 makes this magic posible? Here are some contundent statements to help you solve this mystery.


SUPERIOR QUALITY. Just by holding this camera on your hand, you can feel this is NOT your ordinary Sony, Hp or other similar junk digitals you will find out there. It feels heavy, solid, compact, where every detail has a reason and helps the photographer achieve the "perfect shot" everytime. 

While looking at your subject for image composition, the SUPERB LCD display offers such a crisp, vivid image that is hard to go wrong. The image is there, within your reach...and when you take the shot, you can always alter one or many parameters: no flash this time...SHOOT! Now lets use a slower speed..SHOOT! Now lets open the diaphragm...SHOOT!. Dont like the result? Erase them and play with them some more...until you get the PERFECT SHOT. The bad ones go, the perfect one you keep. And THIS feeling is what photograpy is all about for me. 

Canon G2 just made it happen. Let me say that using this camera is VERY simple. Menus are clear and easy to use. All icons on the screen help you adjust the settings in a virtual WYSIWYG environment. The camera will tell you whether your picture is overexposed, out of focus, etc. But MOST of all, it doesnt stop there...

Of all the digital cameras I�ve tried (very few in fact...), te Canon G2 allows you to BE CREATIVE. The camera will provide you with all the help needed to compose a technically perfect pic. But sometimes: who wants that? You want the backgroud blurred...you need more texture in your subject�s face... a darker mood...a brighter color...just play with the settings. You dont need to wait for the results: go pic after pic, dare to experiment, and during that process, that elusive, rare and prized pic will get stored in the memory card. 

And you did it in a fun, economic, and immediate way. This camera gave me the freedom and satisfaction NO OTHER device has been able to. No wonder I think this is the best buy you will ever make, if your goals and feelings towards photography are like mine. Sure, the price could feel a little high, but you are basically purchasing THE BEST digital camera in the market today.

With features like a full automatic mode, 7 preset "program" modes, full manual, aperture priority or time priority modes, there is plenty of room to maneuver. Add to all this the actual possibility of full manual focusing (that is correct, sir...but this is no SLR...).

Image storage is done via a 32 Mb compact flash card, wich can hold up to 400 images depending on the resolution you are taking your pics.Buttons are located in places where it is LOGICAL to find them. Lens optical quaility is, from what I see on my pics and read on the magazines, among the best in the industry. This is great when handling those amazing 4 Megapixel resolution pics.

If you dont know anything about photograhy, of you are a seasoned veteran, it doesnt matter: you can take the best pics of your life, professional quailty, just by pushing 3 buttons...

Enjoy.
