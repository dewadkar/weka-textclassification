            This spring we decided to trade in our Surburban for a Dodge Durango.  We have had nothing but problems!  Aside from the fact that I feel that we have gotten a lemon there are a few problems with this vehicle as a whole.  If you test drive this SUV, drive 35+ mph and roll down one of the back windows 1/3 to 1/2 way down.  What you will hear is the most deafning, earpopping sound!  I have two children that sit in the middle seats and like to have the window down a bit, because of this noise, we have a 30K car that I cant roll the windows down in!  I have been told by the company that this is a problem with all SUV's, however my brothers expedition and my sister in laws jeep cherokee do not make this noise.
BUYER BEWARE!  Also check the way the front end moves.  There is alot of play. This again I was told is just the way that the vehicle is!
For either of these problems there is no &quot;fix&quot;, there is no compensation after you have purchased and discovered these things!  Watch out!!!!<br><br>
