            I was thinking about purchasing a new car for some time now.  I thought that I knew what I wanted and how much I wanted to spend.  This time around it would be a fast, nimble, flashy sports coupe that would give me the speed, handling and great appearance.  So I looked around, but I was unable to find any car on the market today that gave me all that and didn't cost an arm and a leg.
My first thought was a new Miata -- Would be nice if I didn't mind spending 20,000 grand +. Another consideration was it's size.  I'm 6'3&quot; and there was no way I could comfortably squeeze my frame into it's compartment and still be able to breath.
Pontiac Sunfire -- Hmmm, maybe but a nicely equipped GT would run between 18,000 and 21,000.  Next,... Then one Saturday I drove by a local Hyundai dealership and saw two 2000 Tibs' nicely loaded in Jazz Orange.  Man,.. What a car!  Almost everything I wanted was STANDARD !!  So I decided to take it for a spin and was greatly impressed.  We all heard the horror stories of mid 80's Hyundai cars and I was skeptical at first too.  But after driving it a few miles through the city streets and on the highway my mind was set.  The engine produces 140 HP and it really propels the car quite well.  I opted for the automatic transmission ($750 option). From a stand still the Tib is a bit slow out of the first gear but continue the acceleration and it will scream in second and above! The exhaust produces a nice low rumble when the car runs above 3000 RPM and it's reminiscent of a classic British sportster like an MG.  The handling is great too.  The steering is light and precise. Hyundai did a nice job setting up the suspension. The car feels tight, handles corners impressively and yet it's not so tight that you feel every bump. Climate controls are very effective in cooling, heating, and getting rid of condensation on the windows.  The radio could be a bit better though. I have a six speaker tape radio and it took me quite a bit of time to balance and tune the sounds so that it didn't sound offensive.
Overall I'm VERY happy with this car. Great, small-sports-car handling, multitude of standard options including power mirrors, windows, door locks, alloy wheels, AC, etc. As I mentioned above I opted to get the optional automatic transmission ($750) and a rear spoiler ($435) and never looked back.  I would recommend this car to any of my friends.  The only drawback is the fact that when your friends and co-workers ask you what kind of car you just bought they will most likely say something derogatory about this Hyundai product.  But you know what??  
Hyundai really turned things around, and I for one am not ashamed of saying that I drive a Hyundai. If you want performance, awesome warranty, loads of standard features and tons of fun on long, curvy roads then get out there and drive one for yourself. You will be pleasantly surprised as I was!!  <br><br>
