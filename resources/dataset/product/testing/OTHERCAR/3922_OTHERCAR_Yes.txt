            My wife and I have owned our new truck for one week so far and love it to death. It is a 1500 LT, Ext. cab, 4x4 with the 5.3L engine. The truck is totally loaded with every available option including Onstar. The sticker price was 34,500. We have 2 kids ages 6 and 2 and they love riding in it. It came with the towing package, Z71, locking rear diff. and auto four wheel drive, which is nice up hear in Ohio. The truck really gets up and moves on the freeway and handles well. It is very comfortable and the eight way power seats with lumbar and side support in leather are worth the money if you plan on keeping the truck for a long time. ( I found out you only get 6 way power seats on the LS even with the leather upgrade.) We were looking at the GMC trucks because I like the grill better but I couldn't find one in white. ( And yes, the GMC's are identicle in every way, dont let anyone tell you different.) So thats it, buy one today. You wont regrete it.
