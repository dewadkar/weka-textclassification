            Whoa there! Thinking about buying a loaded Audi A4 or one of those base model &quot;luxury&quot; rice-burners? Well, hey. Sure, you get some value, but with the BMW you get SPIRIT. The vehicle is constructed like a vault, and engineered by some of the top minds in Automotive Engineering. The BMW provides you with something few cars can match---REAL, HONEST TO GOODNESS DRIVING PLEASURE. Don't buy this car if you don't LOVE to drive. Go ahead, buy an Infinity, or a Lexus. But if you love the feeling of sinking into a perfectly supportive seat, firing up a beautiful engine with just the right amount of mechanical &quot;whir&quot;, this car is for you.

The style is downright beautiful, both in the four door and the two door. I love mine!<br><br>
