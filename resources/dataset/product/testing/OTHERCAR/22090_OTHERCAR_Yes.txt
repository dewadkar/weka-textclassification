            Okay here's the thing. I recently bought a Kodak DC-215 Digital ZOOM Camera. From a local Staples retailer. I paid $350 for it. I am very pleased with it for the price I paid. I like the on screen menus and the 1'8 inch LCD viewfinder on the back. It also has a 4mb Kodak Picture Card with holds up to 59 pictures on STANDARD quality and the lowest option. I can get up to 13 perfect pictures on high quality, which is approximately 1152x850 DPI's. Over all it is a good camera for under $ 400.
 The real reason I bought it is because my mom's boss MATT had bought a NICON COOL PIC 950. He paid over $800 for it. We had a bet that at the end of the week the one with the most toys wins. I did. I got a CD-RW drive for X-Mas so he got 1 for the business. I beat him by having a SCANNER. Ok so like I said I am very pleased with it and Kodak honors their warranty good, so I have had no problems
