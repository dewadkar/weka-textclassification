            After scouring Consumer Reports, online sources, and consulting numerous friends who owned one (or more!) Corollas, we realized that the Corolla was the best choice for our price range.  We were considering either a new Corolla or a used recent-model Camry or Accord.  While the Camry and Accord had more room, we found (by trying our car seat in the back seat :) that the 1999 Corolla was plenty spacious for a starting family.  We are now expecting our second child and feel certain that the Corolla will be able to accommodate both car seats.  And we got a NEW Corolla with full warranty for about $3000 less than we would have paid for the cheapest decent used Camry or Accord.

It is worth noting that there is not all that much legroom in the back, although the width is OK.  This makes it somewhat uncomfortable for adults.  But the front seats move back and forward, so you can make as much or as little room as you want.  And if you have the adults sitting in the front, three children or two car seats seem to fit nicely in the back - making the Corolla a great car for the starting family.

The 1999 Corolla provides a pretty smooth ride, although at particularly rough points (like those vibrate strips) you can feel the whole car vibrate.  The trunk is fairly spacious, and we have fit quite a bit back there when we need to.  The seats are comfortable, the controls easily accessed.  The Owner's Manual indicates that unless you drive under harsh conditions, regular maintenance including oil changes need occur only every 7500 miles!  Think of the value and convenience!  Most cars on the road are supposed to have an oil change at least every 3000 miles.  The only caveat I would point out is in terms of noise.  As you might expect for an economy vehicle, the cabin is not terribly sound proof.  The result is that you can hear the wind whip across the vehicle at higher speeds, and make a sound similar to when you have the window open a crack.  So the cabin can get pretty noisy on the highway, and conversation to the back becomes difficult.  Also, the brakes squeak with almost any moisture.  Although we followed the Manual in terms of being extra careful with the brakes for the first thousand-or-so miles, we still found that after a few thousand miles the brakes will squeak when it's humid or precipitous.  We spoke with a Toyota Technician, who told us that the high metallic content of the brakes will do that.  Oh well.

Finally, I want to mention an accident we had in our Corolla.  We slipped on some ice on the highway during a turn in the road.  We spun out, and another vehicle hit us a couple of times on the side (I would estimate at a speed of 40-50 mph).  ALL of the damage was cosmetic.  Not even the support beams were damaged.  We were completely uninjured.  Now *that's* safety.

As I've said before, the Corolla is best suited for the starting family.  That means that if you're single, you have plenty of room for your date.  If you're married, you have room for future children.  And if you already have two children, it's time to get a second (largest) car.  This car is not ideal for a four-adult carpool, either.<br><br>
