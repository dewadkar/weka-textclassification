                 I bought a 1999 Grand Am SE1 with a V6 engine.  I recently graduated from college and needed a dependable, nice looking, and affordable car to drive.  The deal that I got on the vehicle plus GM's College Grad program was also a selling point.  I was able to take money off and get a low financing rate.  This was great for me!  I was finally buying my first new car!  
     I love this vehicle.  The car is a sedan, but it is very sporty looking especially in red with a spoiler.  I wanted a sporty looking car because I was used to driving a 300ZX. Not only is this car sporty, but is roomy.  I am thrilled that I can actually fit adults in the back seat.  In my old car I couldn't.  I love the fact that car virtually operates itself.  I don't have to lock the doors or turn on the lights.  It does it all by itself.
     I love to drive this car.  It handles beautifully.  With the HUGE V6 engine the car has great pick up and acceleration.  I feel totally safe in the car with the driver and passenger next generation air bags.  Many heads have turned when this car passes by!  I believe anybody who is looking for a stylish, comfortable, reliable, and affordable car should buy one.
