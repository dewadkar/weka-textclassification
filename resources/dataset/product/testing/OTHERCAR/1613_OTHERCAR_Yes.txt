            I have a Prism I bought new off the lot five years ago. Before I bought my car, I spent endless hours researching car magazines and books looking for a reliable car. Five years later I can safely say I made the right decision. With it's Toyota built engine, my Prism has gotten me where I need to be without fail. Other than regularly scheduled maintenance, I haven't had to put a lot of $$$ into my Prism and I've driven more than 140,000 miles! I had new cars before, both Hyundais, and I knew I didn't want to get another &quot;throw-away&quot; car. For the price, you get more than you pay for in the Prism. <br><br>
