            The styling of this car is great.  It looks good in a parking place as well as moving down the highway. The interior is very comfortable and nice looking.  It feels like you should have a television remote in your hand.

I have driven over 15,000 miles already on this car and still enjoy the performance and comfort.  The interior is very spacious - can seat six comfortably.  I am over 50 but don't like to be left behind at the light.  Thanks to the &quot;3800&quot; engine, I am way out front when I want to be.  The same power is available for passing on the highway.

Can't say that there is anything that I hate about the car.  The Buick LeSabre would be suitable for young families as well as individuals who desire comfort and safety as they commute to their jobs or just run errands around town.  I am more than satisfied with the value I received from this purchase.<br><br>
