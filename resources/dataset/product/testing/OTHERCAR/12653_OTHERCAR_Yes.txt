            Well, this week my 1995 GMC Jimmy SLE turned 125,000 miles!  

I'm happy to say that everything is doing fine.  I've read the naysayers on this site and though I'm sorry to hear their stories, I've had nothing but good experiences with my truck.  

I had bought a new two-door 1987 Nissan Pathfinder way back when and put 126K on that truck before getting the money available to put into the Jimmy.  I am 6'4&quot; and needed something roomier than the Pathfinder. Though reliable, the Pathfinder was weak and cramped. (It also sounded like a helicopter inside unless I had the stereo cranked up.)  I didn't want a full-size truck since I put on miles and don't tow much, so I looked at the Jimmy/Blazer, Explorer, Trooper, 4-Runner, and Pathfinder.  Out of all, the Jimmy had the right power, gas mileage, size, towing capacity, and sturdiness.  I even tested how fast I could corner without feeling like I was going to tip over - a real problem in the Pathfinder.

So far, my Jimmy has lived up to expectations.  It rides well. No, it doesn't ride like a car - I use my wife's Maxima for that experience.  It handles well.  I've had several experiences of needing to avoid something in the road and have swerved and braked without a problem.  I've driven it up to Big Bear in the winter several times and never felt slippage. I've been caught in sudden snowstorms and downpours in the desert and never knew the difference. The instant-on 4x4 is a lifesaver.  In addition, I've towed my wife's parents' 1974 tent trailer (2200 lbs.) up to Mammoth and June lake three times. All this with the kayak on top and the bikes on the back.

I do feel for those with major problems at low mileage. I have not experienced any such problems.  Up until this year, I have done nothing but preventative maintenance.  And this year's total is only $2000.  That includes new tires (anybody heard of Firestone ATX?), shocks, new front and rear brakes, and new fuel injectors.  According to my mechanic, Bill, who's been taking care of my family's cars for 15+ years, my Jimmy has at least another 150,000 miles to go before it gets old.  I figure a few minor costs here and there are nothing compared to that of a new car.

As for looks, the paint job is still like new.  My Pathfinder looked twenty years old after only a couple of hot summers.  This Jimmy still looks shiny and the interior is in fantastic condition.  I do wash it at least bi-weekly, and I take care of the seats and dash.  

I would highly recommend this truck for anyone with normal towing and/or carrying needs.  Also, if you like riding high but don't like the gas mileage of a full-size this truck is fantastic!  My only request would be a better stereo and some of those cool xenon headlights.  I'll write back when I hit 200,000 miles.<br><br>
