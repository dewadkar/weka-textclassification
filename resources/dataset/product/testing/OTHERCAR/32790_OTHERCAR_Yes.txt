            What a car.  I'm afraid I'm going to sound like a Corvette advertisement, but this car is awesome.  I am a 37 year old engineer, and really enjoy a fun car, but need to also have a car I can commute in.  I finally bit the bullet and traded in my 1991 Corvette (99,000 miles) for a 2000.  I test drove a 6 speed manual, but found the shifter wasn't as smooth as my '91, and they wanted almost $1000 more for it as well, so I got the automatic.  

The handling is wonderful, engine smooth with boat loads of torque, and plenty of interior room for 2 plus your stuff.  Handles bad roads MUCH better than my '91 - does not tend to follow ruts in the road, and a much smoother ride with reduced rattles (roof squeaks every once in a while).  Instruments and controls are really nice - I have a Heads Up Display which projects speed, RPM, and other info on the wind shield.  

One reason why I bought a new Corvette was because all the used C5 Corvettes I found ('97 and newer) cost nearly as much - so they are holding their value well and are in demand.  If you enjoy driving and only need 2 seats, I would HIGHLY recommend this car.<br><br>
