            Strengths:
   This car has excellent workmanship, is a comfortable ride, quiet and fast climate control system, has a very quiet interior, beautiful paint job,unbelievable stereo system, superior acceleration, outstanding wet road handling.  Acura also provides excellent customer service and support. You will never have to worry about reliability problems with this car. 

Weaknesses:
   The only weakness in this car is that it's steering is a little soft, but other than that there are none. 

Summary:
  Overall this is the best car I have had the pleasure of owning. The car feels solid and refined when driven without being too stiff. Ride is a good combination of firmness and comfort. Car is very quiet even at highway speeds. Engine is a V-6 though performance is excellent. Engine is as smooth and responsive as any V-8 I have driven.  It has superior handling and it looks great.  The interior is very comfortable, with soft leather seating and a very easy to use heating and cooling system.  I would suggest purchasing this car to anyone who is considering a luxary sedan.  This car will be better in the long run with parts and service than most other luxury automobiles.   <br><br>
