            I bought this camera along with the Epson 850Z to try side-by-side, my criteria being 2-megapixel cameras with a USB interface. I liked them both and will keep both, but I got better pictures with the Epson (see my Epson 850Z review). It's not that the inherent picture quality is any less with the Canon, it's as good if not better (I've read some reviews that seem to indicate the Epson is less sharp than the Nikon Coolpix, whereas  the Canon is as good). I think the main difference as far as actual shooting is that 1) you have a 3x optical zoom with the Epson vs. a 2x with the canon  2) the LCD is smaller so it's harder to see if you got the picture you wanted  3) it takes more steps to delete a bad photo  4) the battery life is significantly shorter, maybe 40 shots vs. 80 with the Epson. The flash is also a little underpowered with a range of only 10 feet. There is also a quirk in that you don't see the shot immediately after shooting it, you have to switch to playback mode.

So I get more quality shots by shooting off 80 shots and deleting the bad ones quickly with the Epson, than by shooting off 40 with the Canon, especially since it's harder to see the shots and to delete. The BIG advantage of the Canon is the size, it can easily slip into a pocket whereas the Epson has to go in a bag or around your neck. It also shoots a little faster (the gap between pushing the shutter and getting the picture). I think I'll keep both, use the Epson for intensive photo sessions, and the Canon as a camera to carry around for snapshots.<br><br>
