            My parents bought a 1990 Chevy Camaro RS new - my mom couldn't stop looking out the window at it for the first couple of weeks :) But this car's looks didn't last long - after a few years the poor quality of the primer started to show. The paint job, especially on the hood, looks terrible now. It's hard to describe, but anyone who's ever seen a bad primer job knows what I'm talking about. Kind of like a rust, without the actual rust. Very nasty looking - and far too expensive to fix.

The car has had its share of problems - one big one is the trunk. It's a hatchback and after just a few years it started giving us problems. It will not stay closed most of the time. My mother has had to stop using the trunk completely because she is afraid it won't close afterward. Because it won't close right, it doesn't lock either. Anyone who tries can easily just lift the back up though it looks like it should be closed. It also leaks, so beware. 

The other thing I don't like about the car is how loud the engine is.
It gets very annoying. Very very rumbley. Another problem we've had is with the speedometer. Sometimes it just completely stops working while being driven - and sometimes it bounces around between 0 mph and 30 mph. Very strange and very nerve wrecking while driving in city speed limits.
Also, the airbag compartment is starting to peel back from the steering wheel - almost like it's slowly opening. There's not much back seat space at all - I definitely don't recommend it as a family car (my parents didn't care, and my brother and I suffered!). The a/c is also very wimpy -it definitely needs more power.

However, if you like the sporty look - this car has got it! It's a beautiful model and powerful as well.
