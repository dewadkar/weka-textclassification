            After having driven Hondas for the last 20 years, it was time to investigate something else.  My last Honda did not exactly please me.  After checking out many of the recommended &quot;substitutions&quot; for the Accord, the Cirrus LXI seemed to fit the bill.  The ride is far superior as is handling.  I have now driven my 99 Cirrus for 10 months and wouldn't consider another Honda again.  It is also superior in winter driving handling.  The only short-coming is a bit of a sacrifice in gas mileage, though not terribly hard to take since it is a V6. The ride is more like a luxury car compared to the Honda Accord.  The Cirrus is roomier, more solid, and quieter.  The trunk is really big permitting great shopping trips!  I carry a portable wheelchair in the trunk and easy trunk access is a plus.  What makes it even better is that it cost less than the Accord and had more standard equipment!!!  <br><br>
