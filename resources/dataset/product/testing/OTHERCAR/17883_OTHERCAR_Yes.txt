            My Husband and I bought a 2000 Blazer in December.  It is a very smooth ride.  My husband is driving it and can't stand to drive our other car now.  One of our favorite features is the automatic radio volume adjustment.  When we get on the highway, the volume turns up a bit!  When we slow down, it turns down.  Also, the radio will stay on when you turn off the engine and take out your keys until you open your door.  

I was also impressed with the pop up rear hatch.  It is much easier to open than the rest of the SUV's I've seen.  The only thing I don't like is that we can't afford another one.<br><br>
