            My family bought this car new in 1997. It was it's first year as a Mercury clone of the Explorer. We bought it because it mature styling, great features and good value.  We first looked at the Explorer but thought the Mountaineer was done up a little nicer and also looked different from all those Explorers on the road.

Exterior
The styling is very timeless. By this I mean the good looks still are there 5 years later. It doesnt look outdated and still looks handsome. The front is accented by a chrome grill with cool wraparound lights. Also fog lights are standard. On the side you notice standard integrated runningboards, dark tinted windows and black color mirrors and window accents. In the rear you get the basic squared SUV look with tricolored taillamps. The wheels are cool looking metal wheels but should be bigger than 15 inchers. The leave a big gap between the tirewells.

Interior
The dash is very clean and well designed in a light gray color with soft touch materials throughout.  The center console had black plastic that looks a little flimsy in the center. The front seats are well contoured and support almost every size person. The leather is okay but could use a more rich feeling to it. They have power adjustments for both front seats. The rear seat are kind a flat. They did this so the seats can fold flat but they arent to comfortable.  A little  more rear legroom wouldnt hurt.  The rear cargo area is a perfect box with no protrusions. Probably the best in the market in terms of size and userability. Unlike the old Jeeps there is no spare tire sitting back there.

Features
Lots of well thought out features like rearseat audio and HVAC controls, automatic headlights and rearview mirror, doorlock switch in the rear cargo area, rear gate opens  just the window or both window and door, autolocking doors when switched in drive, speedsensitive wipers, combo buttons to unlock doors, etc...

Drive
The drive of this truck is probably the best in the market back in 1997. Now a lot of carbased SUV's put it to shame. The steering is precise, with tight turning radius. Braking is strong with little fade. Acceleration with the old 5.0 is strong almost Mustanglike. Motor sounds like a old muscle car motor but tamed a little. The ride is nice but a bit bumpy on uneven surfaces. Doesnt swallow potholes that well.

Maintainence
We have over 65k on the truck with the only $$ being spent on it so far is one set of brakes at 60k, two airfilters, one set of wiperblades, oil changes, coolant flush and a burned out taillamp. Our tires were replaced for free by FORD. Not bad at all!!!!
