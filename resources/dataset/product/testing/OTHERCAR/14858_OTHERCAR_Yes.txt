            I have always loved Trans Ams.  Lets get that out of the way first.  Second, I have not figured out why someone would buy a V-6 version of this car, because it defeats the whole purpose of the Firebird.

Okay, now to the meat.  I purchase my 25th Anniversary Trans Am in 1995.  Bought it used, but it only had 300 miles on the odometer, what a deal.

I found out several months after buying the car that it had the rare 6-speed manual transmission and that they made only 128 total for the Anniversary run.  From that point on the car became a collector item and I 
have babied it. This car has remained in the garage and is only driven on nice days to which it then makes trips to Car Shows.  It has won several 
awards and I am proud of it.  I love the car and do not ever plan on getting rid of it.  It handles, it gets looks, and the power is just unlawful.  Anyone who has bought a Mustang over a Trans Am has not test drove one or were too picky about some part of the car.  

Don't be fooled by all my good remarks, because there is a Jekell and Hyde story to these cars.  My car has 8077 miles on the odometer and I must say 
despite my love of the car it has been in the shop way too much.  Water pump failed at 5000 miles, paint turned yellow, numerous electrical glitches, weird noises from the car.  GM has got some real issues in quality. My Trans Am has had as much repair as my Toyota with 148,000 miles, and yet my Celica remains quiet and solid.

In conclusion, a word of caution to someone buying a Camaro or Trans Am.  Do not expect it to be some super reliable piece of equipment.  Some people have not had problems and others more than their share.  So if you want a vehicle that is a blast to drive and gets lots of attention, then this is a car for you, but if you want long term reliability, you had better check out something from Toyota, Nissan, or Honda.  I love my Toyota for its reliability of 11 years, but I love my Trans Ams performance and good looks, so I recommend enjoying the best of both worlds.
