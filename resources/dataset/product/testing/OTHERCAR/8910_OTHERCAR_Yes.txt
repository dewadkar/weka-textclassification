            <b>Dr_Steph�s Car Buying History</b> 

<i>(Skip past this lengthy introduction if you just want to get to the facts � spoiled sport!)</i>

Actually, I started my adult years on a used bicycle.  I abhorred our culture�s over-dependence on gas-guzzling, polluting vehicles and vowed to do my part to protect our environment.

When I was about to graduate with my Master�s Degree in 1984, I reluctantly recognized that I, too, needed one of those gawd-awful contraptions so I could haul my modest collection of cheap student belongings to Oregon.  I bought a 1970 Toyota Corona with such a faded paint job that my friends and I decided spruce it up by painting a colorful hippie mural on it.  I scoffed at people with brand new cars, big cars, station wagons, and automatic transmissions (wimps!).

My next car, a Toyota Tercel (brand new, by the way), entered my life in 1987 when the Corona was limping along and I had to get myself to two school psychology internships in two different towns each week.  I reluctantly acknowledged that I needed to develop a professional image and driving a car that looked like an LSD trip probably wouldn�t get me there.  Still, I vowed to only drive small economical cars that got excellent gas mileage.

Hmmm�well, you know�things change.  In 1991 I was going through a bit of a crisis time in my life.  I was over 30, two years into my faculty position, my parents had both just died, and I didn�t have a man in my life.  I decided it was time to recognize that I was all alone in this big bad world and needed to take care of myself.  And what does an independent woman buy?  <b>A truck, of course!</b>  My brand-new red Nissan 4x4 extended cab truck made a strong statement, though I�m not sure what it was.  I tried hard not to think about my earlier vows and instead relished my rugged freedom.  Hey, at least it was a manual transmission!

A lot can change in four years.  In 1995, I found myself pregnant with my first child (not married, but that�s another story) and reluctantly acknowledged that the beloved Nissan truck was not a good baby seat car.  I traded it in for a new Subaru Legacy wagon.  Gasp!  A station wagon?  Hey, at least this one was also a manual transmission!

This long meandering history of Dr_Steph�s adulthood brings you to the point of this review today (it�s about time!).

In 1998, I had two small children, a soon-to-be husband, and the need for a� (shudder!)�family car!  Sure, the Subaru could serve as a family car but it was a struggle to fit all of our baby junk in the car with the kids.  Therefore, <b>I did what I thought I would NEVER do � I bought a brand new, gas-guzzling BIG car with automatic transmission!</b>

Am I ashamed and embarrassed?  Oh, maybe a teeny weenie bit.  Do I love it?  Absolutely!

<b>Dr_Steph Sells Out and Buys a 1998 Grand Caravan</b>

My decision to sell out and join to soccer mom crowd was very deliberate and carefully researched.  I checked out all the vans that were available at the time and compared them to my list of required features.  My new van MUST HAVE:

~ double sliding doors
~ the option of built-in child seats
~ dual air bags
~ anti-lock brakes
~ AWD

A tad safety conscious, wouldn�t you say?  It�s amazing how parenthood can turn a playful deer into a overly-protective mother bear.

Anyway, the AWD requirement turned this into a very short list.  Most vans don�t come with this option.  We live in a snowy climate where avalanches on the mountain freeways are a common occurrence.  I know that front-wheel drive can be somewhat effective in inclement weather but both my husband and I wanted the AWD so the Grand Caravan was our choice.  

<b>The Family Factor</b>

Besides the obvious safety features, we needed a vehicle that could comfortably fit a whole family.  When we purchased 1998 Dodge Grand Caravan over three years ago, we only had two kids at and didn't plan for more.   However, when the third "surprise!" came along, we were especially happy that we had this van because the Subaru Legacy wagon can�t fit three car seats in the back. This van easily fits the kids PLUS a friend or two (or the grandparents) AND all the gear that goes with them (like a portable crib, strollers, booster seats, potty chairs, a gazillion diapers and an extra large bottle of Prozac for Mom and Dad!). 

Now that I've owned this van, I would find it very difficult to be satisfied with another type of vehicle for our family.  There's always plenty of elbow room - enough that you can separate feuding kids, if necessary (heck, give them each their own row!).  When the weather is lousy outside, you can easily walk into the middle of the van to dress kids in boots and coats without ever having to get out of the vehicle yourself.  

One of the best family features of the Grand Caravan is the integrated car seat (optional).  Our middle bench seat has two integrated child safety seats that simply fold up when not in use.  These child safety seats have a very sturdy 5-point harness system and are guaranteed to stay in one place since they are built right into the seat.  They are intended for kids 20-50 lbs. between the ages of 1 to 5 years.  

We�ve used the integrated seats, without any problem, for all three of our kids.  However, when we go on long car trips we belt in regular car seats (like the Graco Cherished CarGo and Evenflo Medallion) because they are more comfortable for sleeping.

We've taken several long road trips in this van (Washington state to California) with three little kids and their gear and have had no problems whatsoever. My husband built a stand for a TV/VCR (see my review on the Philips Magnavox 13�) that we put between the two front seats and the kids can watch movies all day long.  The biggest problem we have is getting them to agree on whether they want to watch Winnie-the-Pooh, Barney, Lion King, or a Pokemon movie.  

<b>The Convenience Factor:  Much More Important Than it Used to Be</b>

When I�m dog-tired, lugging a passel of fussy kids and bags of groceries, convenience becomes are much more important factor to me than it was in my carefree youth.

One of the biggest conveniences of this model is the double sliding passenger doors.  I find I use the driver�s side sliding door all the time to get kids in and out of the car.  The other huge convenience factor for me is the keyless entry.  I can unlock or lock the doors with the touch of a button.  I really miss this feature when I�m transporting kids in the Subaru because I have to unbuckle my daughter from the passenger side and then walk around to the driver�s side door to lock up.  Besides being a hassle, this exposes my kids to more risks in parking lots.

Yes, I suppose the automatic transmission is a convenience, too, though I still feel a little odd about this feature.  It makes me feel like MY parents.  Cup holders in every place imaginable are certainly convenient, even though the kids can�t yet reach the pull-out cup holders underneath the middle bench seat.  

The power adjustable driver seat is a big plus, too because my husband is 6� and I�m 5�2�.  We are constantly having to adjust the seat back and forth, as well as the power mirrors.  A final convenience that I take advantage of frequently are the grocery bag hooks on the back of the rear seat.  No more cans of corn or apples rolling loose around the car when a grocery bag tips over.

This is not just a family car, by the way.  It doubles as my husband�s work car.  He uses it to carry full sheets of plywood (just folds down the back seats).


<b>Those Little �Extras�</b>

The model we bought has an overhead console with a trip computer between the two front seats.  This trip computer provides all kinds of information, including a trip odometer, average fuel economy, distance to empty, instantaneous fuel economy, elapsed time (how long you�ve been driving), temperature, and direction of travel.  

This is an especially nice feature on a long trip.  One of the things we like to do is look at the instantaneous fuel economy when we are driving down a steep hill (99+ mpg!).  One side benefit is that all of our kids have learned north, south, east, and west from looking at the constant direction display.  The overhead console also has a sunglasses holder, a holder for a garage door opener, and two reading lamps.

Another important �extra� for us is the lockable storage drawer under the front seat on the passenger side.  We often lock our valuables in there when we leave the car so they are both out of sight and double-locked.

<b>The Ride</b>

The ride and handling is very smooth and car-like, though there is a fair amount of road noise at freeway speed.  It sure beats any SUV I�ve driven, hands down.

<b>Gas Mileage</b>

The mileage is surprisingly good for a large car ~ around 20 mpg in town, somewhat better on the freeway.

<b>Reliability</b>

Well, we�ve owned this van for almost 3 and 1/2 years and have only had to bring it in for oil changes.  The one warranty service that we requested was to have the front end repainted because we had some fairly substantial paint-chipping in the first winter.  The slope of the nose is such that a lot of gravel on the road tends to hit it.  We added a bug shield to the front of the van after it was repainted and that seems to have decreased the chipping problem.

The 2001 Consumer Reports Annual Auto issue reported �average� reliability for the 1998 Grand Caravan 2WD.  They didn�t have any stats on the 4WD.  Though this year�s model isn�t on the list of recommended used cars, it�s also not on the list of used cars to avoid.  That�s good news!

<b>What About the Disadvantages of This Van?</b>

Other than adjusting to the image of being a soccer mom and some one who has abandoned all of her principles about car ownership, there really aren�t any significant disadvantages of this car.  Our relatives have repeatedly asked us what we don't like about our van and we've been hard-pressed to come up with an answer. 

Although they are minor, there are a few features that the Grand Caravan doesn't have but I wish it did.  I wish it had headlights that automatically turned off when you turn off the engine (like the Subaru).  The headlights do turn off eventually but not immediately. 

I also wish that the seatbelts had an automatic lock feature for car seats so you wouldn't need a locking clip (for car seats in the back seat where there are no integrated child seats). 

Finally, I wish there was a safety feature on the ignition that would prevent someone (a child) from starting the car without pushing a button or something like that.  Although they haven�t done it yet, I worry about one of my curious kids taking this for a little joy ride into the neighbor�s fence.

<b>Overall Recommendation?</b>

Other than a few minor detractions, we are extremely pleased with our Grand Caravan. We will probably buy another one when this one wears out but that hopefully won't be for a long time. In my opinion, anybody with more than one child or with lots of cargo should seriously consider getting a van.

Your car says a lot about who you are.  What does the Grand Caravan say?  It screams �MOM & KIDS!!� but it doesn�t have to mean that.  I know a couple of single guys (with lots of cargo) who own Grand Caravans and love them.  I heartily recommend this car, even if it does involve a significant readjustment in your self-definition and principles.

<i>By the way, we custom ordered our van from the local dealer and offered to pay $400 over invoice (and WAY below the sticker price).  According to Consumer Reports, we probably could have worked out an even better deal but it seemed like a bargain at the time.  The only hitch in custom-ordering your van is that you have to be willing to wait for up to 3 months to get it (it took us 6 weeks).  It's worth the wait, in my opinion.  This way you get <b>exactly</b> what you want and nothing you don't want.</i>
