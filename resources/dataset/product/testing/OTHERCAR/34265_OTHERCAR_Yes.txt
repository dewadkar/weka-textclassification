            [Opinion started 11 Feb 2003]

I have had my little cat (Jaguar X-Type 2.5 Sport) for a few months now, so I thought it about time I wrote about it here.

I understand that this site is geared more to the American market, which is why the 2001 second hand list hasn't got an entry in it for the X-Type, which is why I have it here.

Mine is a late 2001 X-Type 2.5 Sport, which I bought second hand from a Jaguar main dealer, from their approved used car list.

It happens to be the same style as the one used in the sample picture for this site, right down to the colour of the bodywork and the wheels. The colour is called "carnival red", the wheel are 17 inch, 10 spoke alloys.

The interior is in the sand colour and is a half leather finish, meaning that the sides of the seat and backs are leather, along with the headrests, the bit you sit on, and lean back against is cloth. I found this to be better than full leather and pleased this is how the car came, after having a full leather courtesy car. The full leather although it had electric heating was extremely cold in the wintry condition here! It was also quite slippery.

The car also came with a number of non-standard extras:

Multi stack 6 disc CD changer in the boot.
Folder door mirrors.
Electro-chromatic rear view mirror.
Centre console armrest.
Split folding rear seat.
Message centre/Trip computer.

Driving...

The car is very quiet, well it was to me, after driving an Audi Coupe 2.2E for 5 years. The engine is very smooth, but has a very narrow power band compared to the Audi. The Audi was very difficult to stall, the Jaguar is easy to stall, as it likes to have higher revs to pull away. Once moving the quietness is very evident, body roll through corners is virtually non-existent by comparison, and turn-in is sharp and precise. Straight tracking is very good, and made motorway driving more of a pleasure, as it didn't wandered about in the lane as much as the Audi did.

However I did have to become less lazy about changing gear. The Audi had a very close ration box, and was happy to be in 5th gear from 30mph upwards, even going up fairly steep inclines. The Jaguar does not, preferring not to be changed up to 5th until at least 35mph, but preferably 40mph. Engine rpm in 5th is lower in the Jaguar for a given speed, than the Audi, which probably explains why. The manual also refers to it as "Overdrive 5th", further re-enforcing the point.

On my first long journey I was disappointed to experience a faint throbbing which would appear between 65 and 75 mph. I took the car back to the dealer, who kept for several weeks to track the problem down. During which time they loaned to me a brand new X-Type 2.5 Sport Automatic. This had the same problem, but I kept this quiet to see what the dealer found.

After rebalancing all the wheels, replacing drive shafts, the prop-shaft, they resorted to bolting a vibration analyser to the car, taking measurements and sending the data back to head office. This led them to suspecting a prop shaft bracket misalignment. This cured the problem for a week or so, and the car now has to go back for it to be examined again. Jaguar news group contributors have indicated that this problem once it is sorted out properly, doesn't return... I hope so, as it is the only black mark against the car in my book. It is likely that this problem will not occur with the 2.1 litre X-Type, as this only has front wheel drive, and therefore no prop shaft.

The loan car in some ways made me happier with the car I chose. The 2002 engine sounded a little noisier, this may be due to it being so new. I'm very glad I chose manual, as the automatic gears, exhibited strange gear choices at times, and alarmingly so on one occasion...

This occurred when pulling away after a light went green, crossing the junction and quickly slowing down to join a queue of cars on the other side. I braked almost exactly at the pointed when the gearbox had decided to change up. This seemed to confuse it somehow, and the engine revs almost red-lined for a couple of seconds as it changed back down to first.

The loan car didn't have the electro-chromatic rear view mirror. Back in my car, I realised how good this really is. What it does is it gradually darkens the mirror depending on how much light comes from the car behind. It is a shame that having gone that far, they didn't do the same with the door mirrors.

The trip computer, I missed a bit in the loan car, but not a great deal. It only has a few functions:

Odometer,
Trip distance
Average Speed
Range
MPG

There are A and B sets, for Trip, Average Speed and MPG.
Units can be switched between kilometres and miles.

The MPG reading is not instantaneous, perhaps only being updated every mile or so.

The range function is quite useful and doesn't appear to be too inaccurate so far. The message centre is set to display this most of the time in my car.

Bad news everyone... 

Last weekend was one of the worst in my life, can you believe me and my X-Type were involved in two accidents in less than 24 hours, but I think some useful information has come out of it for you lot. 

Saturday morning I was crossing a crossroads junction at a green light when the car going in the opposite junction decided to turn right without stopping. This meant he tried to pass in front of me with only about 7 or 8 metres of space, and at just under 30mph that clearly wasn't enough for me to stop, and I hit him. 

The other car was a small ford van. In the UK the model is called a Fiesta. If people are not sure how big this is, it is about the same size as a Volkswagen Golf. 

Basically the left front corner of his car hit the left front of my car starting at the numberplate and striking a glancing blow to the side of the car. The jaguar held up very well and was still drive-able after the incident. The bumper was still intact, but badly cracked and scratched. The polycarbonate lenses on the headlights took quite a hit, but did not shatter and all lights still worked. 

The van however lost his headlight and indicator on the left side. The front bumper was almost smashed, and his steering was definitely out of line, and his radiator was leaking water. 

The following morning a woman in a similar sized car to the van, ran through a red light and hit my car on the right side, front the rear door to the front. Her car was in a similar state to the van. The Jaguar was scratched all along the impact point, but because I was turning at the time, the right front wheel was exposed and hit. This damaged a track end rod, that connects the steering rack to the wheel, and the car although still moveable, had to be taken away on a truck. 

The point is that the jaguar obviously absorbs impacts far better than the two cars that hit me last weekend, and is far more likely to still be able to get you home after such an incident than many cars I'm familiar with. 

The next positive is the help I received from Jaguars own care services. I rang them up and they arranged a truck to collect my car and take it directly to a Jaguar workshop ready for repair, once the insurance companies have given the go ahead. 

They amazingly consider the damage to be light, and once allowed to proceed, reckon they can have the car looking as good as new in less than 3 weeks. 

Well now back to where I was before all this happened... 

Fuel consumption! 

The literature suggests a combined cycle mpg of about 28mpg. This is supposed to be made of some city driving, some motorway driving and some open road. I haven't been able to get mine above 25, even with a high motorway content. Around town (London) I'm steady at about 24mpg, which compared to the Audi is not bad at all. The open road figure of 36mpg seems unobtainable to me; maybe this can only be achieved after a long distance at 56mpg.

My insurance company has received notification that both other parties accept full liability. My car should be back with me in 2 or 3 weeks looking as good as new hopefully. I'll let you know what the quality of the Jaguar workmanship is like.

A couple of quick comments about Jaguar Assistance: Under the warranty, Jaguar includes membership with a car recovery company. At least this is what happens here in the UK. They will come out to where ever you are. Lift your car and complete your journey for you, and arrange for the car to be seen to.

The Jaguar servicing garage have spoken to me and kept me in touch with what is happening at their end. The original dealer has spoken to me to commiserate with me over what has happened.

Very friendly and personal service; I have not come across this before.


[Added 13th May...]

Can you believe I still haven't had my car back, although the goods news is that the Jaguar workshop expect me to able to have my car back next week, and they will bring it to me!! Excellent!

The delay was not down to Jaguar, but to my insurer and the insurers of the other parties. It took them weeks to haggle and argue over which insurer was going to pay what portion of the damage. They eventually decided and work was able to start, so that was the good news. A little off topic, but the driver involved in the second accident has decided she wasn't at fault after all, and so the wrangling and dealing is going to have to start all over again. I'm NOT happy! Oh! Well! C'est la vie!
