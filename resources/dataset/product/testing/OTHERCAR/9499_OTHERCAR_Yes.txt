            This baby looks like one hell of a truck, but let me tell you, it drives like a Caddy! This disproves the myth of the rugged looking ride being a rugged ride.  Once you sit inside you know it's special. The interior is simple and just right. They designed every button and switch to be accessible to those who are wearing gloves. I purchased a '94 Dodge Ram 1500 SLT with all the bells and whistles. So far I have not had one problem with the truck (knock on wood). It's seen slippery ice and blizzards of the mountains to the pot holes of the city. I love how it sits nice and high on the road. This gives you a head start in seeing potential trouble ahead. The airbags make you feel somewhat more secure if the large front end doesn't. I'll tell you though, the V8 does not like city driving. That would be my only caveat. If you want to save on gas, do not purchase this beast. If you don't care, then keep on truckin!<br><br>
