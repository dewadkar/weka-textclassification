            The 1993 cadillac deville is one helluva sweet ride.  The best feature is the smoothness of the ride.  You can drive over almost any surface and not have a bumpy time.  It also have incredible acceleration.  You can barely put your foot on the pedal and the V8 engine kicks in and takes off.  Being accustomed to my 1993 Corolla, this was quite a sensation.

The other stuff you get cause this beauty costs a little extra are: crazy legroom in the front AND back, electric seat adjusters, sweet stereo, and gigantic trunk.  You could fit about eight beanbag chairs in that trunk!!

Problems that I see are the price if you dont want to spend a lot on a car, or you might be favorable to foreign luxury cars instead of american ones. (like me)  

But altogether, they dont call it the cadillac of cars for no reason.  Its extra feature as well as engine ability are well worth the dough.
