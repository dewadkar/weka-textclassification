I am reviewing this car based on my test-drive with it when I was *this* close to buying one a couple of years ago.

This car got a major redesign in 1997.  In '98, it got an additional 5HP (probably from some exhaust tuning).  

Exterior:  I like it!  The back-end looks really cool, and the front is actually nice to look at.  Certainly attractive, and the headlights look expensive (a &quot;good&quot; thing).  And the side-view is pretty generic, but pleasant.

Interior:  Decent space, the back seat ain't too bad either.  Really!  I'm 6'3 and saying that.  Btw people complain too much about rear seat space.  Sheesh.  The dash is too generic, I don't like that.  The center console too.  I mean the gauges are very clear and large and the view out of the windshield ROCKS like in most Honda products (panoramic, you almost can see the asphalt right under the foglamps ok?  Heheheh).  Stereo is decent, but should be better.  No power seats.  The cloth isn't that nice, so good thing you can get a leather interior from the dealer, for more $$$ of course.  Also, carbon-fiber dash looks SWEET.

Driving:  This car easily has one of the best-feeling clutch and shifter combo I have ever tried.  Fabulous.  The car is so controllable and tossable it's unreal.  The engine sounds AWESOME (for a 4 cylinder) over 4000RPM, and has a very good spread of torque.  The thing pulls as hard at 7k as it does at 4k, or so it feels.  Triple digit speeds come on real fast. The car is quite quiet for a sports car on the highway too!  Handling is truly fabulous.  I tried the type SH.  This comes with a unit that reduces understeer by &quot;sensing&quot; cornering forces (basically a yaw sensor, like those used in the advanced Traction control systems in the Caddy STS and German high-end luxos) and directs more engine force to the outer wheel (left one if turning right, and vice-versa).  It's quite transparent, but regardless, the handling was sublime.  Utterly impressive.  Brakes were excellent too.

So the price is a little high, but you are paying for perhaps the best handling FWD car out there you can buy.  The chassis is VERY solid, and it's reliable in every sense.  They should charge some kind of premium, and rightfully so.  However, it has and will remain to fall victim to cars advertised with more HP and with flashier exterior designs.  But for pure driving thrills, if you are a true enthusiast, I cannot imagine you not getting a great experience driving the new Prelude.  Drive it hard though to really see how impressive the package is.<br><br>
