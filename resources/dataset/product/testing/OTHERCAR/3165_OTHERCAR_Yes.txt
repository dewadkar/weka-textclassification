            The Z28 brings a new a passion to the car industry which had lost its way from the old muscle cars of the '60s.  It has inspired a new passion in those who truly love cars, especially the best cars, one of which being the Camero Z28.  I especially enjoy the earilier models of the Camero, comparing them to the modern Z28 is a real joy in my mind.  Just take this car for a test drive and you will quickly notice the responsiveness, as soon as you press that pedal you feel an instant jolt in your acceleration as the engine revs.  The price is reasonable, its priced like a normal car, but can have the engine of a Corvette.  Just look how everyone stares as you pass by in a Camero, for all they know it could be a Ferrari.  The price is so reasonable it really is tough to get over.<br><br>
