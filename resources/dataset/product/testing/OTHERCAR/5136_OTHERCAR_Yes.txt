            You'll be asking yourself questions like these when the Dodge Dakot with the Mercedes made engine burns past you.

The new Dakota's are almost like sports car, sleek, sexy, and cool. But they also have the brute edge that most trucks hold. The Dakota can take the offroads like no other, than zoom home smooth and quiet on the highway. 

The Dakota is the younger brother to the Ram, but I would prefer a Dakota over a ram any day. It is equally strong as teh Ram, cheeper, and can burn it any day.

When looking for a new truck, give the Dodge Dakota a serious try...<br><br>
