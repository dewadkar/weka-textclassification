            2001 LS8 sport package. Initially the car was great. I like the way the washer/high beam stem is positioned. The suspension is fairly tight and the V8 provides good power. The big problem has been quality. A few months after I leased it new the advancetrac went out, pretty much taking the brakes with it. Had to use the auto transmission to down shift and pump the breaks or the pedal would go to the floor and she wouldn't stop. Dealer fixed this after replacing everything the computer could come up with. Took a week or so. About 8 months later, 14k miles, the valves started rattling like a diesel. This car has had nothing but 93 octane name brand fuel. The dealer kept it for a week, went through the easter egging diagnostic procedure and finally drained/replaced the fuel. Ran good for a couple of days. Back to square one with no idea of the cause. It's such a shame, if not for these quality issues the LS8 would be a great car. I can't wait for the lease to end. Back to F350s for me.
