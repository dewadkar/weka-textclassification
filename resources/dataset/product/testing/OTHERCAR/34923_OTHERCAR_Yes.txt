            I bought this Honda Odyssey in the fall of 1999 after being on a long waiting list for one.   I did not even get to test drive one until I had bought mine!  

I was looking for a family van and found the Odyssey to be a good van for us.  Another good point of the car is that it has the most powerful engine for mini-vans.

A great thing about this van is how easy it is to take out the seats.  The back seat folds down into the car.  When the seat is up you get lots of storage room in the "trunk" in the huge place where the seat folds down into.  This is nice if you have something that you don't want to roll all around in the car.  The rear seats come out very easily and are not that heavy.  With the seats taken out and folded down, you get lots of cargo room.  

The sliding doors are nice because you just hit a button and the door opens for you.  This is nice when you are carrying something and you don't have an extra hand to open the back doors.  You can open them from the remote, the rear seats, or the drivers seat.  

The only bad things with this van is the road noise and the beeps from the doors when they are opening or closing.  It beeps and beeps if you put the car in Drive when the doors are open and doesn't stop till you close them.  The road noise is annoying sometimes but its not that bad.
