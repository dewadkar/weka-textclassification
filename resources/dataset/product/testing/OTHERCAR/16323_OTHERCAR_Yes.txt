            Adding to my business web page with current high quality photos is very simple and much more effective than scanning in photos. The picture quality is truly fantastic and if you have under or over-exposed your picture - no problem. You simply fine tune your pictures with the accompanying software or you just retake the pic. No wasted developing costs on bad pics. Instantly view your photos on the camera, PC, or TV.
You are also able to print directly from the camera's storage disk (if you have the proper printer - HP Photosmart P1000). 

The software takes a bit of time to get accustomed to however. I also don't like the fact that you have to plug the camera into the BACK of the computer to download the pictures into you hard drive. (If you have the newer HP CPU though I understand that the plug-in is easily accessible on the front of the unit. 

Initial Cost: Somewhat high
Recurring Costs: Low
Helpful Accessories: HP Photosmart Printer P1000
Ease of Use of Camera: Very Simple
Ease of use of Software: Somewhat confusing
Instant Gratification: Yes, an instant camera that does not waste pictures<br><br>
