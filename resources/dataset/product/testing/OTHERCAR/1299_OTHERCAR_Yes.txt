            I bought my '97 SR5 4Runner new with practically every option (except leather package):  Alarm/remote entry, 3 disk CD, Cassette, AM-FM premium sound system, 16" alloy wheel package, ABS, Moonroof, Towing package, Running boards, Wind deflectors(front, rear and moonroof), Cold weather package, Limited slip, Floor mats, Retractable cargo cover and rear cargo area mat, Roof racks, Fog lamps, Power windows/Locks.

Even with all this there are some things I'd like to see added or changed:

Add: *outside temperature/compass combination
     *auxillary 12VDC outlet(s)
     *larger gas tank (I've read reviews saying that the
      4Runner is a gas hog, I've gotten 24mpg on trips and 
      about 16mpg on daily commutes, although tromping the 
      pedal does eat the gas, a larger tank would save 
      trips to the pump.
     *heated side mirrors.

Change:  *position of front cup holders (located in front 
          clock and heater vents.
         *sun visors should be larger.
         
I've driven over 74,000 virtually trouble free miles in this 4Runner, only major expenses were tires at about 52,000 miles, front brakes and rotors at 73,000 miles (probably due to a 3 hour drive to the mountains almost weekly during spring, summer and fall, many times pulling a fully loaded utility trailer up and down hills).  I've never had a vehicle get such life out of brakes, this is the first time I've replaced the brakes and then only the front ones.  I've traveled down rock strewn creek beds, through snow and mud, and use it for my daily commute to work.

Overall I would buy another, but am still very happy with the one I have, just feels broken in, I know that when I hit the gas pedal it'll move out and throwing the 4 wheel drive lever will get me out of everything I've gotten into so far, with the brakes never failing to stop me.
