            Ok, Maxima SE with all the trimming is not exactly cheap but for $27,000 (with all options and taxes!) you get a well made 4 door sedan that may as well be a sports car.  Maybe I'm a little biased because I had leased a 00 Maxima SE and I love the car.  But before buying the 01 model I test drove Accord V6 (both coupe and 4 door), Camry V6, PassatV6, GrandAm V6, BMW 330 CI coupe, Grand Prix, 02 Altima, Accura TL and Acura CL.  

Compared to it's top two Japanese competitors (Accord and Camry), Maxima has more power and handles much better.  Maxima is little noisier than Accord and Camry but it's not that much louder.  Higher level of cabin noise can be attributed to wider tires (225 55R17) and the way door wraps to the roof of the car.  I think the 2002 model addressed the wind noise from the doors.  I like Maxima's interior better than Camry or Accord because the center console flows smoothly from the dash to the center arm rest which makes the cabin look more sporty.

Compared to Maxima, Passat is overpriced, underpowered, and cramped.  Passat was fun to drive but I got bored with it in about 15 minutes.  Acura TL and CL are both very good cars but the styling is bit too conservative more my liking and few thousand dollars more than Maxima at similar trim level.  

GrandAm and GrandPrix are both nice cars but the workmenship just wasn't there.  I test drove top of the line GrandAm with just over 2000 miles on the odometer and I already heard creaking and rattles on hard turns.  The wheels on the GrandAm had a shinny plastic cover.  I guess GM wanted to make the wheels look like aluminum wheels???

All right, you can't really compare BMW 330CI coupe with Maxima and yes I liked BMW 330CI better.  Not just because it's BMW but it looks lot nicer than Maxima and let's face it, chicks dig BMW's.  But with all the options I wanted BMW came out to about ten G's more than Maxima, ouch.  

My last comparison was with the redesigned 02 Altima.  245HP!!! Baby! and it handles great too but the interior looked really cheap even with all options.  

So from the bunch Maxima came out on top, at least for me and I'm very happy with it.  If you are planning on buying a Maxima, find out what the invoice of the car is with the options you want (www.edmunds.com or some place like that) and go to the dealer with it.  Put couple of hundred buck over the invoice and make an offer, they'll usually take it.

One last thing, 2000 Maxima and some 2001 had auto tranny problem and some 2001 models have problems with coils.  These are warranty fixes so you'll not have to pay for them.  You can check the National Traffic Safety org board to find out more about these defects.  Trust me though, compared to other cars, Nissan Maxima's have far less reported defects.
