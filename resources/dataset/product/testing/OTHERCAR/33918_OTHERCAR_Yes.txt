            I leased this vehicle new right after it was introduced and has turned out to be one of the best vehicles that I have ever owned. It rides great, gets decent gas mileage and has a great stereo system. The interior is nice and the seats very comfortable. I liked the fact that the spare tire was not only full sized but was mounted on the same rims as were supplied with the vehicle. The major issue I have with this vehicle is the very loud and very high-pitched noise coming from the A-pillar. Depending on the head wind this noise only comes into play at speeds approaching 95mph but I have heard it even around 80mph. It is so loud and annoying that even the great stereo can�t drown it out. I am not sure if this is specific to my car or if the issue occurs on all Highlanders but I would expect better from Toyota especially for a $36,000 SUV! The other major issue I have with this vehicle is the 105mph speed limiter. This vehicle seems to have a ton of grunt and could easily go faster. When it hits that electronic speed limiter it hits it really hard! I also have 2 problems with the control stalks on the steering wheel. The high beams, when activated, move the stalk away from the steering wheel. This makes it more difficult to reach when using the turn signals. Toyota should design this switch like Honda does. The switch should click on the high beams but not change it�s position from the steering wheel. Mazda apparently does the same as Toyota! The cruise control stalk is also an issue when driving as it is affixed directly to the steering wheel. This makes it hard to locate when even doing slight turning maneuvers. This stalk should have been mounted directly to the steering column, this way it will always be where your hand is feeling for it. The cup holders on my 2001 model are too small to hold large bottle drinks but this is on an optional center console. The 2002 model looks has a built-in center console so perhaps this is no longer an issue. If you drive normally this is probably one of the best SUV on the market but if you live near the Autobahn, forget about it!
