            <b>Sticker Games.</b>

My Daughters play sticker games for fun. They are 15 and 16 years old, prime ages for the full on assault of the Spears and Aguilleras, the Martins and the Boy Bands. Christinas sticker head pasted to Ricky Martins body. Justin Timberlake with Brittnys belly button. Then they give this pop art away to their friends and commence to launching another attack....and I shake my head low in approval.

Who are the losers in this sticker game ? Nobody gets hurt, the millionaires are none the wiser, and my daughters live to sticker another day, so I guess the losers would have to be the lampooned ones themselves ! No harm no foul.

In a worse case of the sticker game the folks at the <b>Honda Motor Company</b> have to be likened to two teenage girls giggling in their collective rooms after another successful sticker game. "Lets get an <b>Isuzu</b> body and put a <b>Honda</b> head on it and see what happens."  For those who were offended at the Spears-Martin illustration at the beginning of this I feel your pain because I am offended at Honda's sticker game.

<b>WHY-WHY-WHY ?</b>
<i>To be said in your best Oscar worthy dramatic voice.</i>

In the Honda Motor Company's stable are some of the best most innovative suspensions in the world. They pioneered the now ubiquitous "<i>Double Wishbone</i>" suspension, the it benchmark from which all others are compared. It is on their line from the Civic on up, so why do this ? 

Do what ?

<b>Fool me once...</b>

For all intents and purposes, and in all actuality, the "Honda" <b>Passport</b> is nothing but an <b>Isuzu Trooper/ Rodeo <i>(They are very similar, the Trooper and Rodeo)</i></b>. Plain and simple, <b>NOT A REAL HONDA</b>. Though there is nothing inherently wrong with an Isuzu Trooper, to try and pass it off as a Honda simply because of a sticker game is wrong. So there's mergers, buyouts, takeovers etc. but if it is an Isuzu, call it an Isuzu owned by Honda or whatever, just leave the sticker games to the girls.

If you are considering a <b>Honda Passport</b> based on the good name and reliability of the Honda reputation you may want to take a little longer with your decision and carefully choose whether this is the vehicle for you or not. Maybe a Honda CR-V would be a better choice, an actual Honda with the full "<i>Double Wishbone</i>" suspension !

<b>The Isuzu...errrr  Honda Passport Suspension</b>.

If this was a review of the Isuzu I would have been less brutal, but I don't like games, so I'll review the Passport suspension as it is, just the most basic type in existence.

The rear suspension on the Passport is as completely a basic system as you can find. A solid drive axle with a simple spring and shock system and a minimalist anti roll bar, PERIOD ! This has been the type used since your Grandfather was tooling around unpaved roads in the farming community.

The front suspension is also a simple tried but true SLA or Short arm Long arm configuration like all rear wheel drive have had for decades. Though the control arm suspension is not a bad one by design it doesn't have you looking forward into the twenty-first century admiring modern technology, but staring in your rearview mirror at yesteryear thinking how glad you are that we are moving forward and not stuck in a rut.

Well from a comparative standpoint the Passport is in a rut. Again not a bad suspension for an Isuzu, but this claims to be a Honda. The suspension works well enough for the low end SUV that it is. A torsion bar set-up handles the springing and just like at the rear, simple shocks handle damping duties and that in a nutshell is the gist of it. The anti roll package is adequate, but with the boxy and high stance this vehicle has you do experience a substantial top heavyness when cornering, not a confidence inspiring feeling.

The steering system is basic as well. A conventional steering box and tie rod system like the days of yore. The good news is the front suspension usually holds up quite well. Tie rods and ball joints have been historically long lasting and well made, so it should give you years of trouble free operation if it is properly maintained.

What I am not saying is that the Honda Passport is a pile of junk, no not at all. What I am saying is if I were to be researching a potential vehicle purchase and was at the Honda dealer being shown the Passport under the impression it is a true Honda, I would want to know all of the above to aid in my process.

It is a fine basic vehicle for grocery getting and hockey moms going to and from the arena, but a far cry from a performance SUV where you'd want to take it seriously off road, and it is definitely not what one would expect underneath if they were looking for a "real" Honda to compliment their own stable of vehicles. 

I have worked on many Isuzu Trooper, Trooper II and Rodeo vehicles over the years and to be honest they do hold up quite well. They are actually quite tank like from a suspension and steering standpoint as well as in the ride and handling department, so this is one bonus to this particular sticker game. But......

Don't be fooled on this sticker game folks. If this is all you are really looking for, a very basic four wheel drive at an affordable price, it's not too bad a mode of transportation. If you are looking for a well handling four wheel independant suspension all wheel drive vehicle that handles well and carries the true meaning of the word <b>Honda Motor Company</b>, pass on the Passport.
