            I bought my Saab 9-3 because I did my shopping and it was the best car around, bar none. My husband swears by his BMW, I swear by my Sven (oh yeah, I named it). I never thought they could improve on the classic 900 turbo convertible but boy did they! This is a sleek, lean, driving machine. And I don't mean fast driving only, I enjoy my car even in the slow lane of a jam packed freeway. The best features are of course the steering (responds to minute movement immediately), strength (for a 4-cylinder it's got a lot of power) and the cool way the top comes down under 30 seconds with one button and one latch (I timed it to a traffic light change and beat it by a few seconds, once). And yes, it tells you the weather in 6 languages. My only objection to this car (and it's a minor one, mind you) is that the rear glass is too small. It's glass mind you, and in a convertible you have to chose between plastic and wide,-- like the ones the BMW designers are fond of--, or made out of glass and smaller, otherwise they don't fold into the trunk all that well. I know the choice is limited, but hey Saab guys out there, get your think tanks to think up a new alternative, will ya? One last tidbit, important to me and perhaps to you the reader as well: Saab does not haggle on the price, the dealers have a set price and they stick to it, and you the buyer get the same price wherever you go. Don't know about you but I hated the idea of buying a new car simply because I didn't want to shop around for that extra $50 off or the free mug, I wanted a straight answer and I got one. Saab, and I think Geo, are the only manufacturers with set prices, that is why they are not part of the AAA membership deal where they find you the best price etc. I would hate to see my car listed at a lower price two weeks later in a car magazine and with Saab, I know that's not happening. One last endorsement for the makers of my Sven.. when he passes, after a long and happy life, I'm marching straight into the dealership and getting me his junior. That's satisfaction, ladies and gentlemen!<br><br>
