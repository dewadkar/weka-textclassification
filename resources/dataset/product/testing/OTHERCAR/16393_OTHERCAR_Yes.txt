            <b>Update</b>  I traded my Geo Storm this June '03.  The heater core is rotten, and I didn't want to fix it. Oh but I do miss it.  The mileage at the time was 225K.  I am still amazed at the sight of it running up and down our road.  The people who got it love it and can't thank me enough.  I even told them all about the high mileage and heater problems.  The engine is strong though.  I am currently looking for another Geo Storm.  It is unlikely that I will be able to find a square back like the one I had. boo hoo!!! <b>End of update</b>

I bought my Geo storm when I first moved to the Upper Cumberland area of TN.  I lived in the hilly region and traveled 60  miles to and from work each day.  I needed an economic vehicle.  I had also previously owned a geo metro.  So I had something to base my purchase on.  My previous geo got 40  mpg.  This one gets around 34  mpg on the highway.  It is a heavier body and a 4 cyl. engine.  
  I love my Storm because it has been reliable with 140,000  miles on it. It handles well on these curvy roads.  I teach at two different schools, so travel reimbursement rates and mileage costs for me really make a difference.  The ease of getting materials out of the back is great.  In the rain, I can flip the under seat hatch back release or I can put my materials on the back seat easily  enough.  
 For family travel, there is enough room in this car for me and three half grown kids and all of our camping gear for a weekend of camping.  We can also fit a week's worth of travel gear if we want to.  It's a bit tighter squeeze though.  
 What do I dislike about this car?  Well, it's very noisy.  This is road noise, not squeaky noise. My husband does not like to get in and out of it at all. It is a bit of a fold-up to get in and out.  On long trips the seats become uncomfortable.  Going uphill, I do have to downshift.  I do wish the engine had more power in going uphill.
  Driving this vehicle is fun.  It is also exciting.  It handles well in the rain with front wheel drive etc... It makes the driver feel confident in the vehicle's ability to stay where it is supposed to within reasonable driving habits.  (It will leave the road if abused)  It is a basic no frills car.  The windows are not power windows.  There is no cruise control on this car which means the driver is more involved with the task of driving than if cruise control were an option.  It is easy to see all around when passing on the interstate because the mirrors and windows provide excellent views all around the car.
This is a great car for single students, two child families, or couples just starting out.  It is also a great car for families whose children are leaving the nest.  Okay, it's just a great car.  I would use it for towing behind a motor home on vacations, a second family car or a first car for my teenagers.
