             Think rugged SUV�s are the only exciting new vehicle offerings available? Think again, as Honda�s premium Acura division recently introduced its latest high-performance sports coupe, the Acura RSX.  The RSX is the replacement for the long-standing Integra, which accounted for a significant portion of the brand�s sales.

 The RSX sports totally new equipment and components to make it a worthy competitor in its category, with a sub $20,000 to $23,000 price range, depending on configuration.  Two models are available, a standard RSX with a 160 horsepower 2.0 liter inline 4 with 141 lb-ft of torque, and a high-performance RSX Type-S with the same engine retuned to produce 200 horsepower and 142 lb-ft of torque.

 Both models are very well equipped with such things as automatic climate control, power moonroof, cruise control, remote keyless entry with alarm, four wheel disc brakes with ABS, and power mirrors, door locks, and windows with auto up/down and pinch protection.  Numerous passive safety features are also standard, including front and side airbags, front and rear crumple zones with 5 mph impact absorbing bumpers, a collapsible energy-absorbing steering column, and side-impact door and floor beams.

 Although the standard RSX does have plenty of power considering its weight, a few more features that aren�t available on the base model, but do come standard with the Type-S may interest buyers who don�t care for the more powerful engine.  These added components include larger front brakes, standard leather seating, stiffer suspension, a six-speed manual transmission instead of the five-speed, and a Bose audio system with 6-disc in-dash CD-changer instead of the Acura audio system with a single in-dash CD player in the base RSX.

 The only two options available in the standard RSX are leather upholstery priced at $1000 and a 5-speed Sequential SportShift automatic transmission priced at $900 that can be shifted as a clutchless manual.  The Type-S is fully equipped, offering no additional options, and the 6-speed manual is the only available transmission for that model.

 The car drives exceptionally well.  The competent suspension controls body motion very effectively with minimal body roll around sharp bends, the steering is communicative and precise, and it reduces what would be a significant amount of torque steer, and the brakes have a very controlled, linear feel that stop the car in reasonably short distances.  As for the ride quality, the RSX succeeds yet again with its excellent sound isolation and supple suspension over bumps and other road irregularities.

 The ergonomics present inside the car should win awards with large and extremely simple controls for both the audio and climate settings.  At night, gauges illuminate a cockpit fighter-plane red, while during the daytime they sit on a sporty metallic silver background.  In both environments, the driver can easily determine vital information.

 The EPA estimates fuel economy at 24 mpg for the automatic and at 27 mpg for both manuals in the city, and at 31 mpg for the Type-S and at 33 mpg for the base RSX (both automatic & manual) on the highway.  Although premium fuel is required for the Type-S, only regular is needed for the standard RSX.  Both models come with a 4 year 50,000 mile warranty including roadside assistance during that same period.

 The only three quibbles I had about the RSX were the absence of high intensity discharge xenon headlights, which provide much greater visibility than even the best halogens, and some type of active safety aid system such as a limited slip differential or traction/stability control on the options list.  Furthermore, the Type-S should include a larger, more aggressive wheel and tire package to complement its increased performance.

 However, if you�re looking for a sporty, near $20,000 coupe, then look no further than the Acura RSX, as it provides almost all of the comfort, handling, features, and performance one could ask for and expect in its price range.
