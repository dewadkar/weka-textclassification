              I was just out of high school, happily newlywed, and what of course comes next....a baby.  I decided my current car would not support a child.  So my husband and I packed up, and went shopping.  As I looked around, I saw many cars that would suit my needs, but none that seemed to suit my style.  When I saw the Cavalier I immediately knew that I wanted it.  So for a good price, I drove away in a new car.  I was so excited!  
  I have driven my car now for less than a year.  The seat belt covers are all gone and lost, the passenger seat is broken, the horn does not work, and best of all, I wrecked it. My husband works at a distribution company, and of course they own a few semi trucks.  Every day I bring him dinner to work.  As I was backing out of the small parking lot, which I've done every day for 3 years, I caught the bumper of one of the semi trucks.  I cringed, thinking that I left only a scratch, since I felt no impact whatsoever, and drove away.  Once I got home I was so surprised by the amount of damage.  There was a huge dent in the back fender, and a scratch all the way across the car.  This tells me one of two things.  Either the car absorbs shock well...or the car is extremely fragile.  Because of the fact that everything else is so cheaply made, I would guess that it is fragile.
  Many things about this car bring me discomfort...the car seat takes up the whole back seat, the seat belts always come off of their hooks, the air conditioner and heater only circulate in the front, it is entirely generic, with no power windows, seats, or anything.  To top it off, the Cavalier has weak horsepower.  When I take of from a stop light, I'm surprised people don't honk.  And getting onto the freeway is a large task, as well as with any other busy roads.
  The worst part of all....I went to the same dealer to trade it in for a new car.  They looked up my account, and checked the blue book.  This car is only worth $3,000!!  I still owe $6,600!  My car has no worth at all, after only a couple of years.
  If you are a family oriented person, with kids, a life, and a desire for comfort of any form, I would not recommend this car.  The Chevy Cavalier is for a young person, who needs a first car, or someone who only needs some simple transportation, and does not have a lot of traffic in and out of the car.  I wish that I would have looked up a review first, to see how it may have rated!  I would have never bought it.
