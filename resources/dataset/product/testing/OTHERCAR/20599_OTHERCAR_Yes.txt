            I bought the A4 Quattro 3 years ago when it was first introduced to the American market.  At that time I was looking to buy a 4-door sport sedan and I had my mind set on the BMW 328i.  A couple of days before I went to the BMW dealer, I read a review on the A4 Quattro.  The review intrigued me and I decided to test drive the Quattro.  That was the best decision I made.
The first thing that caught my eyes about the new A4 was its look.  Audi has completely redesign the body of their new A class sedans.  The old-styled rigid angular design is gone and the new smooth aerodynamic look is in.  I especially like its back design with its short trunk door and curved rear bumper.  The A4 that I test drove, and eventually bought, was the 5-speed automatic Quattro.  It is powered by a 2.8 liter V6 engine, the same engine that the BMW 328i used. The standard version of the A4 is back-wheel drive.  The full-time 4 wheel drive Quattro is a $1500 option.  In my humble opinion, the Quattro is the best option ever offered by any car manufacturer.  With its full time 4 wheel drivetrain, the A4 has exceptional handling on all types of road condition.  Driving the A4 on rainy and snowy road, which I have done many times, gave me a great sense of safety because I knew that the chance of losing control of my car was minimal.  The high performance all-seasoned Goodyear Eagle RSA tires also helped.  The BMW has comparable handling on dry road but far underperform the Quattro in bad weather condition.  The A4 Quattro has slower acceleration than most other sport sedans due to its full-time 4 wheel drive system.  But once the car gets going, it is as swift as any on the road.  My A4 has full leather interior with headrest on all four seats.  The BMW has headrest only on the two front seats.  The interior of the A4 has somewhat smaller than that of the BMW.  If you are 6 feet 4, you may not be able to put a passenger in the back seat behind you.  This car is definitely made for small people.  Consider the size of the interior, the A4 has a surprisingly spacious trunk.  If you enjoy concerts in your car, you would love the optional Bose 8-speakers music system.  Even BMW did not have this option at that time.  In fact, the BMW offered only half as much options as the A4.  And the best part of it all is that, the A4 costs much less than the BMW.  My fully loaded A4 cost me $31,000 as compare to $36,000 for a fully loaded BMW.  I am glad that I chose the A4 over the 328i, it is a much better value for your money.    <br><br>
