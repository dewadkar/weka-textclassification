            All of my experiences with the Xterra have been outstanding.  It is a tough truck, and will hold up to just about all of the abuse you can give it.  I have been off-roading many times and still have no squeaks coming from the Xterra.  Many SUVs with unibody construction will develop squeaks very easily, but the Xterra is body-on-frame and holds up quite well.
Many people bash the Xterra for having a bad ride and not having a powerful engine, as well as not handling very well.  It is a truck, and is based one a truck platform.  If you want a good ride, get a BMW.  If you want to go fast, get a sports car (or a BMW), and if you want something that handles well, then, well, get a BMW.  This is a TRUCK.  It has lots of space, a solid frame, and is comfortable.  It also costs about $25,000, rather than the $30k-$40k you could spend on some other SUVs.  It's power is more than adequate.  After all, it's not a dragster.
I have found it very useful for hauling all of my stuff between California and Texas (for school), as well as off-roading and hauling all of my friends around.
My Xterra has taken some damage from other cars, and it is always relatively easy and inexpensive to fix.
Finally, the four-wheel-drive system is better than you are going to find on most SUVs in its class.  Looking at the CRV the RAV4, and the Escape (which are both built on car frames), the Xterra is the easy winner when looking at durability and utility.  If you just want a cute, tall car-like SUV to haul your stuff around in, and not really use off-road, get a CRV, a RAV4, or an Escape.
The Xterra, I feel, is the easy winner among those mentioned.
