            Acura is having a resurgance of sorts.  With it's Global midsize platform (Accord, TL, CL, MDX) and it's venerable 3.X liter silky smooth V6 powerplant, Acura is bound to make the bean counters at BMW, Mercedes and Audi quake in their boots.

The TL is heavily feature laden.  In fact the only option for the car is Acura's excellent and easy to use Sat Navigation system.

The car is motivated by an energetic, quiet and smooth 3.2 liter V6 that employs VTEC (Variable Timing and Electronic Lift Compression) to produce more than ample power.

The designers at Acura have made this more of a &quot;luxury&quot; car than a &quot;sports luxury&quot; car.  Handling (as in most Honda products) displays understeer when pushed hard.  Brake pedal feel is mushy, but is easy to modulate, and has more than acceptable clamping power.

The engine is smooth, and provides ample passing power at any gear.  Cruising is this car's forte, and the engine is downright at ease at highway cruising speeds.

Inside, you are treated to Acura's logical dash, and very ergonomic button layout.  Front heated seats and get this......Xenon lighting are both standard.  As is a very nice sounding BOSE CD/Tape player with......you guessed it......a subwoofer.

As I have stated, this car is chock full of options, and should make all but the most picky, extremely happy.

Reliablilty is top notch, and so are dealer practices and standards.  This is a very enjoyable car to drive, the structure is solid, and feels like it is milled from one piece of metal.

I couldn't think of a better car to get into the luxury market.  Acura has hit a solid bullseye with this car!<br><br>
