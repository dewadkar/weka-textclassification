            I replaced a GMC Suburban with the new Yukon XL about nine months ago and after 12,000 miles I am very satisfied.  However, I still refer to it as my Suburban.  I think GMC made a mistake changing the name.  However, in upgrading the vehicle they excelled.  They refined and improved the Suburban.   The brakes and the ride are much improved.  Also, the value compared to price was very good. I was able to buy mine for less than what I could buy a new Ford Expedition.
I use my vehicle for towing a boat and hauling a lot of gear.  It excels for these uses.  I hardly notice that my 21 foot boat is attached.  The load levelers works great.  Having the spare tire mounted below, provided even more hauling space ( However, changing a flat is a challenge the first time.) Also, if need be, I can haul 8 adults comfortably.  You could cram two more in if needed.   As much as I love my Suburban (Yukon XL), I would not recommend it for everyone.  It is somewhat difficult getting into a tight parking space and it hurts the pocket book to fill it up gas at today's prices. I get about 15 to 17 mpg on my 4 wheel drive vehicl when not towing a boat.<br><br>
