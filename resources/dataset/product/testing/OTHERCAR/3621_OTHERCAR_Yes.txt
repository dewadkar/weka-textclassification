               This car has to be one of the most fun cars to drive! With that said, I'll get on with the review. I own a Ford Mustang LX and it is a hard car to get used to. I often have trouble adjusting to other cars because of their setups. Although the Grand-Prix is very different from the mustang, It is easy to get used to. The model I drive is a GTP 2 door model. This car is one of the higher models, but not that different from the base model except for the supercharged engine. The Grand-Prix comes standard with power steering, ABS (anti-lock brakes) and traction controll (which saved my @$$ more than a few times!). The overall feel of the car is great. You feel connected to the car as well as the road. The controlls for the radio in the GTP model are on the steering wheel as well which makes it alot easier than fumbling with stations on the center console. It has excellent pick-up and tremendus stopping power! I was suprised when I floored the gas and I had to peel myself from the seat considering the car is front-wheel drive (which tends to have slower pick-up). The traction controll keeps you from loosing controll of the car when going around turns to fast on a slick road. The anti-lock brakes will keep the wheels from locking up when stopping suddenly. All of this adds up to an excellent safety system and an excelent car! I highly reccomend this!!!<br><br>
