            This camera is a great way to start using digital without spending a lot of money. I've found it easy to learn and fun to use.

You can't take a lot of pictures without uploading--6 in fine format and 13 in normal--but with LED monitor, it's easy to check the pictures and delete the less than great ones as you go along, so I haven't missed the space. You have a choice of taking pictures through the regular viewfinder and then playing them back, or you can view them through the monitor as you take them. I switch back and forth between the 2 options, depending on the pictures I want to take.


The photo quality is fine on a monitor. I haven't had any photos printed but I would guess the quality in print might be lacking a bit. The camera gives a good range of focus--from a macro option of 4 inches to a regular option of 28 inches up, and the pictures we've taken at these ranges turn out equally well.

Uploading the images to the computer with the enclosed software is easy enough, in my opinion. One thing that I didn't like though was the manufacturer recommends using a power adapter during uploads and they don't include it with the camera. The camera does drain batteries so I would strongly recommend either buying the adapter or using rechargeables and keeping an extra set ready to use. 

One more negative is that the camera is designed with the battery compartment on the bottom and the plastic lid isn't all that secure. Sit it on the table a bit too hard and your batteries will fall out. That's one little design flaw that Fuji should work on. 

Other than a few little things, I would recommend this camera to anyone wanting to try digital for a reasonable price. <br><br>
