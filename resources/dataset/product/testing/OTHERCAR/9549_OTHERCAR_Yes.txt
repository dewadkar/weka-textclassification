                 The first thing you notice about the all-new Celica is its eye-popping styling.  This ain�t no station wagon to haul around your kids on the way to the grocery store.  The new Celica has sleek styling that�ll turn as many heads as a Ferrari, but for ten times cheaper!  But the new Celica is much more than just appearances.
      Sit yourself down in the driver�s seat and find yourself held firmly in place by supportive bucket seats.  The retro styling inside manage to bring together the best elements of the new and old.  The instrument cluster is attractively arranged, and the new console has been delicately placed to be in perfect reach.
      What�s under the hood is more impressive than ever.  Reaching that magical 100hp/liter mark is a big milestone in an inexpensive mass-produced car, and the Celica has managed to do it brilliantly.  The new VVTi 1.8L 4 cylinder makes a respectable 180hp, and inside a light 2600 lb car, makes driving more fun than ever.  Despite being front wheel drive, the handling is confidence-inspiring and mimics that of the late Supra.  On the track, it�s managed to best everything from the Honda Prelude, to rev-happy Acura Integra GS-R
     If you find yourself in the GT-S model with it�s 1.8L, 180 hp motor, be sure to opt for the 6-spd manual transmission.  This slick-shifting transmission is geared short, for great acceleration.  Where else can you find a 6-spd for less than $25,000?  Only the soon to be discontinued Camaro Z28� need I say anything more?  With the new Celica, you get more bang for your buck than nearly anything on the market.
     But no car is perfect.  The seating is a bit cramped, as would be expected in a sporty compact car.  Rear seat room isn�t exactly accommodating, but the hatch back design makes for plenty of space for storage.
     All in all, it�s an incredible car that more fun to drive than nearly anything within $50,000.  I�ve got more praise than I could possibly put down, but I�d rather be out driving!
