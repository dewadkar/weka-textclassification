            As the proud owner of a Nissan Maxima, I am in LOVE with this car.  As a newly married couple without children, we were looking for a &quot;sporty&quot; car that would also serve our family, when we decide to have one.  We decided on the Maxima.  

Its sleek design prevents us from feeling like we need to be breaking out the Depends.  Its four doors makes it versatile, whether throwing groceries in the back seat, or letting the dog hop in so we can take it to the park.  This car has even received my teenage brother's seal of approval.  

With its standard V6, it is easy to do 90 in this car and not realize it.  We haven't had many problems with it, with the exception of inconsiderate people slamming their doors into it.  

It is nice and wide, turns easily, and provides plenty of room for long trips and long legs.  It gets approximately 27 miles to the gallon (city).  

The price tag can run a bit high, which is why we bought it used.  The cost of insurance is average.  

I would recommend this car to anyone who is thinking family, but not ready for the Buick or stationwagon.<br><br>
