            I own a 97 Infiniti QX4, a review has already been posted on it.  I also own a 97 Disco SE7.  It handles road imperfection with surprising comfort and off road, well it goes without saying.  Here is a true off road vehicle that can be used off road.  The exterior requires little concern in comparison to the others that have all the nice glitter and gold but would not last a season of off road driving.

The driving position is incomparable to any other vehicle.  Giving true meaning to rider visibility and comfort.  You sit right up there, far from the passenger; your own cockpit if you will!

The luxuries, well I can do without them but since I do have them, I make the most of it!  They are in the right places and all the extras in the vehicle like the sunroof, roof mounted pockets, front and back as well as the leather make for a comfortable and enjoyable ride.  Giving everyone their own area of the vehicle.  This is nice especially if you have young ones!

It consumes gas and the low headliner is a problem but nothings perfect.  Just adapt and live with it.

REVIEW UPDATE DECEMBER 22, 2003
_______________________________

After having owned this vehicle for almost 4 years now, I thought it time to update the original review.

My opinion so far is just great! Like with anything that ages, it needs some work here and there but nothing major.

I should state that I don't take my vehicle to a dealer - at all! For one obvious reason, it's expensive and although it's a labor of love for me, I prefer to know the inner workings of my vehicle. This has an advantage in writing this review. The clear benefit of being able to comment on more than the obvious.

So with this in mind, let me continue this update.

Like I said, a few repairs here and there but nothing serious.

A few dash bulbs have blown and can easily be replaced, the clock keep slowing the bulbs which costs about $6.00, this has been fixed by modifying the holder to accommodate another type of bulb and is still working.

The transfer lever will get stuck if not used so you need to use it once every few months.

The fuel pump died without any notice which will leave you stranded although it was replaced the next day.

The exhaust has sprung a couple of leaks and the emissions check engine light likes to be noticed frequently. This is normal as it seems to be sensitive. so you might as well get an ODB-II reader and reset the check engine light or spend some cash at the dealer to reset or, better yet, just live with it!

The interior has held up really well. I have taken the vehicle off-road a few times now with stock tires and suspension and although not designed to go through thick 2 foot mud patches, it will handle robustly well off-road. It gives the sensation of sturdiness.

The body has started to rust a little, especially around the rear right alpine window which seems to be where water ingress occurs, keep an eye on this. Mind you this is surface rust as most of the body is aluminum and not prone to rust rot. There is also this type of rust on both rear passenger door wheel arc's.

The vehicle has aged surprisingly well considering what it has been through and shown little signs of trouble.

I am still happy with my rover and cannot think of a better suited vehicle.

I also subscribe to a list of enthusiasts who seem to dabble in the idea of doing a lift which there are many options, in fact, there are many things you can do to a Rover, and they are available from many sources.

Fuel economy is something of a non-existent reality so expect to fork out gas money regularly but if this is not an issue, an extremely good vehicle considering the price they now can be had at. Approx $10-15,000. That's a great price for a vehicle that can do over 400,000 kms if properly kept.
