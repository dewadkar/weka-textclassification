                I've just returned from my local Honda dealer, my wifes lease on her 97 Mazda Miata is about to run out and she wanted to go look at some cars.She said she really doesn't care what she gets just so long as it has four doors. I guess 3 years stuffed in her tiny Miata has left her longing for something a bit larger.

     We were looking at a long line of Honda Civics when I spyed it in there showroom. A lovely green metallic 4 door 96 Acura Integra GSR. It had been slightly modified by its original owner. Lowered a couple of inches, 16&quot; TSW Imola's, Z-rated Nitto tires , stainless exhaust,etc. It had a nice leather interior and appeared just about perfect all the way around. Only 56,000 miles from new.

     I asked if they would take it out of the showroom so I could test drive it and they gladly obliged. My wife and I got in the front seats and the salesman climbed into the back. The salesman directed me to some nearby quiet backroads so I could open the GSR up a bit.

     This sedan behaves much like a Civic in most casual around town driving maneuvers, but drive the tach beyond 4,000 rpm and this car lets out a banshee scream you'll normally only hear coming from an F1 car. This delightful scream is only enhanced by the sedans stainless exhaust.

     You definitely have to keep the rpm's up to 4,000 and above to extract this little 1.8 liter four bangers potential, but with the little Acura's V-TEC technology and an 8100!! rpm redline keeping the revs that high would be a pleasure rather than a chore.

      Ride level was surprisingly good considering that this car had been lowered and was riding on super low profile high performance rubber. Ride comfort was definitely a cut above what I would have expected. Cornering was fast and flat very little body roll, I don't know if the original owner had upgraded the stabilizer bars in the chassis or not but this sedan had just enough give in the suspension. Not too firm yet not too floaty.

      As far as room goes this four door wasn't bad at all. I don't think 5 people would fit very comfortably, but 4 should fit just fine, just so long as those in the back are under 6 foot. I'm about 5&quot;11 and after  I adjusted the drivers seat to my liking, I jumped in back to see how much room I had. My knees just skimmed the back of the front seat and my head had maybe an inch to spare from the headliner. Not gobs of space but remember, my wife is used to a Miata, not exactly a benchmark when it comes to roominess.

       The GSR's shifter had a nice notchy feel to it not at all rubbery like some front drive shifters do. Not as nice as her Miata's but then again Miata's shifter IS the benchmark when it comes to shifter performance. The clutch effort is light and the takeup is good. I can't imagine owning this car with an automatic transmission I don't even know if it's available with one, I hope it isn't, it would be a crime to equip this car with an autobox.

        I never really liked the way 4 door Integra's looked before, somehow they just looked awkward, but for some reason this one looks great. Maybe It's the wheels and the lowered suspension. Any how here's my dilemma, buy a brand new Civic, or a four year old pocket rocket. Decision, decisions.
