            I am a union worker, so it's important for me to buy AMERICAN! The Chevy Cavalier is a good choice. I've always been a General Motors kind of guy, and I've owned Cavaliers and Pontiac Sunbirds before. This 1999 version is the best of the lot. It is screwed together beautifully - not a rattle to be heard. The automatic transmission shifts smoothly, and the engine is relatively quiet. The steering is tight, and it corners nicely. The only thing I don't like is the two spoke steering wheel - I miss the two extra spokes at the three and nine o'clock position. The air conditioner and the heater throw out the right temperatures. The radio and CD player sound great. 
You won't believe what I paid for this car. The sticker price was about $14,800. Subtract a $2000 rebate. Subtract another $1000 to get it down to invoice price. Then subtract another $3000 in GM Card rebates that I had saved up, and my total to the dealer was $8800! That's all I paid! 
I'd give a nice review of the GM Card rebate program, but that's another subject altogether. Suffice to say, that I am extremely happy.  <br><br>
