            This is a wonderful little car to own for those who are careful spenders. New and used models can be had for great prices, and you will find yourself having to fill up much less on this 4-cylinder sports compact. The engine may be small compared to some larger more expensive cars, but it does have some torque, and can be modified for performance. There are many aftermarket parts for the Cavaliers, which is a plus if you are into modifying your car. 

The body style is sleek and sporty. The handling is good although there is some body roll, which could be remedied by better sway bars. The interior is nice until you look more closely, some of the parts are plasticy and are not made well. I have had some interior parts come off. The stock sound system sounds very good.

Overall it is a fun car to drive and fun to modify. It is great for students.  The Z24 model is faster and sportier.
