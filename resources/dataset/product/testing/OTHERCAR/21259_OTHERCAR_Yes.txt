            I love my Toyota Camry!  Honestly, I never thought that I would own a Toyota!  I had bought Pontiacs and Buicks for years, but this time I decided to get what I wanted.  I'm so thankful that I did!

A month after buying my Toyota Camry 2000 I was on my way to work. I'm a teacher, and it was the first day of school.  Well, I heard the brakes of the car behind me.  It was the loudest screeek!  Before I knew what was happening I was hit from behind by this full size pick-up truck.

The impact was very strong, but to my surprise I was able to walk away with only a bump on my head.  My car withstood the impact as well.  The pick-up truck had to be towed away,but I was able to drive my Toyota on to school.  I was actually able to make it to the first day of class.  The rear of my car had to be fixed, but the repair shop said that my Toyota did exactly as it was supposed to have done.  It withstood the impact.  I'm just soooooo thankful to have had my Toyota!<br><br>
