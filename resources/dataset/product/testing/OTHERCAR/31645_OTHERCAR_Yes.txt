            When I was looking for a car, i roamed around a lot, trying lexus, mercedes, BMW and Infiniti cars.  But at the time i tried the Aurora, I fell in love with it, literally...

The engine was sounding like a &quot;real&quot; engine and was powerful enough to always drive safely.

The driving position is perfect, will all commands at the tip of your fingers.  One thing I also liked are all the beautiful lights when driving in the night !

The car sticks to the road very well, has a lot of place for a family, and... Needless to say, the thrill that goes with it.<br><br>
