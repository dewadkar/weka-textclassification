            The Dodge Durango is a monster on the highway. It is a great, dependable vehicle. If you're looking for a vehicle that allows you to be comfortable, feel safe, and have room enough for the family, the Durango comes highly recommended. The bench seat is a major plus for this vehicle. It is great for carpooling! Put the seats down &amp; you have room enough to hall boxes, bikes and much more. I test drove them all &amp; no more than pulled out of the lot with this one, and new it was the one. There is so much praise for this vehicle, that it is too bad that there has to be something to hamper a decision...GAS MONEY! Be prepared to make a stop everyday to fill it up. Make sure you can stand seeing the clerk inside the gas station because you will see that face quite often.<br><br>
