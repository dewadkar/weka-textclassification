            About a month ago I bought a nissan sentr, it is used but it runs
great.  I am writing about it to let people know that it is a great car.
If you are looking for a compact car this is definiitely the way to go.  
I am a senior in highschool and it perfect for me.  It is such 
smooth driving cat, it hasn't given me any problems and there is 
120,000 miles on it!  It looks and runs perfectly, you would never 
know it is almost a ten years old.  A CD player was put into the car 
by the previious owner and the sound system is superb.  There is
also a moon roof that was put in and the car looks great..  I was
immensly impressed with the ease of use of my nissan setra.  It is a 
five speed, and I was a little nervous about shifting, but I was 
a bit surprised to find that the clutch  and shifter of my vehicle is 
very easy to use, and was very easy to learn on.  I hi ghly
reccommend the Nissan Sentra to anyone looking for a reliable  
and safe four door sedan
