            I bought our 95 Jeep grand Cherokee Laredo for my wife. She was pregnant at the time and was traveling a good distance to work. We live in New England and the winters are harsh. I wanted a safe vehicle and one that would get here home in bad weather. Being a cop, and seeing hundreds of accidents. I knew what would stand up in a crash. I was always impressed at the amount of abuse the Grands would take and keep the owners safe.
Its a heavy, full framed truck. Not some after thought 4 wheel drive, a real truck.
My next thought was getting the V8 model. The resale would be higher, and it could handle some other duties around the house. One of which was pulling a tree stump out of the front yard! Yes, it did it. The all time 4 wheel drive is fantastic. No shifting, just drive. The stump required low range, simply move the lever and go. Its been 72K so far, and just one problem. The computer began making it run rough at 56k miles. It was replaced under warrantee. Same exhaust and no major engine work ever done.
Brakes, oil, tires and the usual stuff were done.
The paint(Black) still looks new. The grey cloth interior held up fine even with our 2 kids and juice boxes galore.
The ride is firm and handling quick and nimble. The V8 is a bear, and hard to keep under the speed limit!
I have looked at the 2000 models, but cant bring myself to part with my 95. It still rides and drives as tight as the day we bought it. Its a credit to Jeep and there attention to detail.
By the way, I have something to compare it to also. We owned a 91 Ford Explorer Eddie Bauer before the Jeep. We will never go back.

UPDATE!!
7/2/2002
My wife has 90,000 miles on her Jeep now.
She will not part with it. The new Jeeps are using a Jeep motor that has less than acceptable reliability records. We have a mechanic friend that advised us to stay away from the newer versions for awhile.
Done since last review:
Front and rear brakes.
Tailpipe
Plugs,wires,etc.
No major service to be done. Professionally checked and inspected. Shock are about due I think.
We will keep you posted!

UPDATE!
7/2/2003

Well the Jeep did a great job for us but it was time for a new car. Last month we traded her in for a BMW 323 sportwagon. We got 6500.00 for the trade. Not bad for a 95 Jeep with 90K on her.We did not have any major concerns, but the water pump did let go recently. The air conditioner had a slow leak, and it was getting loose and rattling on the big bumps. We went to the BMW for a couple of reasons.
The new Jeeps did not offer the 5.2ltr engine. They have gone to the engine used in the Dodge Rams, this engine has problems. I get my info from a local dealer who sees what gets fixed the most.
We also found the V8 was a bear on fuel.
The BMW fits our needs now, but we still love the Jeeps!
