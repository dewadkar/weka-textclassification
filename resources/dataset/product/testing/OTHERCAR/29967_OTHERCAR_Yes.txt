            As I want to buy a mini van in the near future, I'm renting several kinds of them before, to give them a test drive (the test drive at the dealer is just for a few minutes. I like to try them out for a few days, at least). The main thing I'm looking for in any car or van is <b>1)</b> How powerful It's climbing up the hill, and <b>2)</b> How powerful is braking going down the hill. The main thing in a car is the driving, right? Then, I'm looking how comfortable it is, and for features.

The Grand Caravan is good in everything, but the MAIN thing: the driving itself. Don't have enough power. Doesn't stop like other vans. I like smooth braking, even at a short-stop. In fact, it's not so bad, but I've seen already better ones (In the 2001 brochure they say that braking is now better than ever. Maybe...)

One other small factor I dislike this mini van is that the Power door locks, Power windows (front and rear) buttons are a little too far. It's not "at your hand".

But, after all, if I would find a good deal on this mini van, I would buy it. And so you...
