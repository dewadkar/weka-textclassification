            I used to have one of these cars. It is the best car I have ever owned...lost it in the divorce!!!! A great looking sports coupe with the horses to back it up. This car was great in town and on the highway.

Great gas mileage, quick for passing, nice interior, roomy for the size of the car. Decent trunk space for a sports coupe.

Drove it when I lived in California and it was great on the hills and curves out there. Handles well and doesn't lose it gusto on the hills.

The only drawbacks to this car are the slightly higher insurance premiums and the possibilities of getting a ticket because it is hard to resist the urge to punch the pedal.<br><br>
