            Why did I buy? Wanted an off road truck, did not need a 4wd.

Truck has plenty of ground clearance, have taken it places I would not dare with my previous truck(an '85 toyota 2wd longbed).

It's definitely not a 4x4, however the locking rear diff really works great. Used it to free my wheels in a gravel wash, and to finish a steep rocky climb for which I got stuck 3/4 the way up. 

The Extended-Cab Prerunner rides and feels like a big truck. The V6 has plenty of power, really accelerates, great on the highway and washboard trails. I test drove a 4 cyl model, that truck seemed very under powered, engine shook and strained under acceleration. If your interested in a Prerunner go for the v6, the four cyl seems to be a bad match for the 4 spd auto-trans. I have a buddy that got the 4 cyl extra cab, and his fuel mileage compares to mine, we both get just over 20MPG in the city. 

If you want a sporty good looking truck, and venture off-road the Prerunner provides ground clearance, power, comfort and style. 

If you really need the security of a 4wd, and price is a concern, a stripped 4x4 would probably cost as much as a v6 Prerunner. TRD goodies like big tires, alloy wheels, skid plates, fender flares, and a cd player could be added to a stripped 4x4 over time.
