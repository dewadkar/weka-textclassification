            I purchased my 1999 626 LX in the fall of 2000 from Hertz Car Sales with 25,000 miles on it.
It has been the most reliable car I have owned to date.  My only gripe with it was the color.  I wanted a red, but settled for a white and regretted that choice for 3 years of owning it. 
The ride of this car is what sold me.  I went and bought it and was all set to buy a Toyota until the minute I sat in and drove my Mazda.  It was so smooth and felt a bit 'heavier' than the other cars, which I liked.  It gave me the feeling that I wouldn't get blown off the road, and perhaps if in a collision, I'd be ok.   
Add that to the overall roominess of the car, and the trivial, yet oh-so-nice 'swing' air vents, and I was hooked. 

The only thing that went wrong with my car in the 3 years I had it were the brakes, which I was told when I bought it would need to be replaced by a mechanic I took it to.   I had to replace the front brake pads last year, at about 35,000 miles, and it was surprisingly cost efficient. 

One other small thing was that the passenger side front window would squeal at high speeds, as if it was not quite sealed correctly.  Had it bothered me immensely, I would have had it looked into, which I never did.

My only gripe about this car is that it is so reliable, one starts to take it for granted and it gets boring.  It's looks are less than stellar compared with the others in it's
class. Still, it is an attractive car.  I always wished the body was just a *little* smaller and more agile.  

All in all, though, this was a fabulous car.  I would buy one again in a heartbeat, if they only had continued to make them in red after 1999.
