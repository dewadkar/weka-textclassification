            My 1994 Achieva is my first car. When my dad was looking for a car for me, he found this one and a dull blue Ford Tempo. I am forever grateful that he bought this one instead. When we bought it, it ran, but there were problems. It had been sitting for quite some time, but because my dad knew what he was doing and had friends who knew what was going on, it was fixed and running for about $200. One problem that wasn't really avoidable is the hail damage. But it's not as bad as I think. You can only really see it at certain angles and it didn't mess up any of the paint.

One of my favorite features is the power that it has. It's a 3.1L V6. I can take most cars on hills and have no trouble passing on the highway. The mileage is at almost 110,000, but I can't complain about how it drives or handles. I would like it if it turned a little sharper and easier, but it's not too bad. 

The only major complaint is that it's hard to judge the car. I'm only 5'2" so I sit low in the seat and can't see the end of my car. It took a little getting used to and sometimes it's still a little difficult to tell what's going on. 

I do love the fact that the dashboard guages are angled in as are the stereo and climate controls. It makes it so much easier to reach things. The stereo isn't that bad, but my front speakers were shot and needed to be replaced.
