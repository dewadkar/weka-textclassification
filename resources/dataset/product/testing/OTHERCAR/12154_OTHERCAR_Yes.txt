            This is a great niche car for anyone looking to slide into a Porsche without going all the way. Unlike the 924 and some 944's, the 968 (actually a 944 S3) fits the bill as a compromise between the 911 classic, yet expensive, and settling for something else. 
What you get is a 4 cylinder, 240 hp, 3.2L engine that purrs and gives you big boy power. The front looks like a 928. The back looks similar to a 944 coupe. If you go for the cabrio convertible, which I recommend, you will own a unique, eye opening, reliable, insurable, affordable piece of handmade European crafted auto machine.
There is nothing out there like it. I think it blows away the Z3, and other roadsters in its price range.<br><br>
