            The Daewoo Nubira.  Well, their right about the weird name.  And their also right about the serious car.  This is a serious car! I know from experience.  I bought a '99 Nubira in October and I love it.  It's the lowest priced car for the options you get.  I received the following standard features:
-keyless entry
-alarm
-CD Player and cassette
-Aluminum Wheels
-Power Boost Button
-3 year, 36000 mile scheduled maintenance warrantee(out of this world)
-3 year, 36000 mile basic warrantee
**the only extra option I got was floormats.  
Other options include:
-leather interior
-power sunroof

It's the best value in the auto world today.  My car is a 4 cylinder, but it drives and has the power of a V6.  I can outrun my husband's truck!  It's quiet, comfortable, and perfect for anyone on a tight budget or someone looking to save money.  I strongly encourage you to at least test-drive a Daewoo, even if you're not looking to buy a new car.  It is truely an experience.  I will never drive another make after driving my Nubira.  Daewoo also makes the Lanos, the smaller, more compact model (compared to the Geo Metro), and the Laganza, their entry level vehicle. There is no other like them.  Daewoo dealerships are located in only about 200 cities across the U. S., including Atlanta, and Birmingham, AL, which is where I purchased mine. Look for them in all major cities.
Go for it, take a drive!! You'll never go back to another!!<br><br>
