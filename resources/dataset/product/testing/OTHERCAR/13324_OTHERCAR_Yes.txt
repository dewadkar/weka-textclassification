            My wife and I bought our 2002 Forester L in May of this year (2002) after realizing that our 2001 Honda CR-V wasn't going to cut it anymore for getting us to and from the mountains in the winter (see my review on the 2001 CR-V).  We were drawn to the Forester because of Subaru's excellent reliability record, the 165-hp engine, and the overall design and comfort of the Forester.

The ride is superb, on dry and wet pavement; the AWD system makes sure that it hugs every corner you hit, even at high speeds.  One of the first things we did was take the windy Oregon Hwy 20 to the coast; it handled like a dream.  It's like there's glue on the tires.  Acceleration is crisp and quick, and there's no shudder at all between gears in the automatic...you can't even tell it's shifting without looking at the tachometer.

Our Forester came with the CD player and subwoofer/amplifier combination, which sounds fantastic.  It's not a Harmon/Kardon or Bose system, but the sound is great, and the sub/amp combo add a little something which you'll definitely enjoy.  The dealer had also added the rear dust deflector, chrome tail pipe cover, cargo net and remote keyless entry.  Haven't used the cargo net yet, but everything else has been very much enjoyed.

One reason to get a Forester, or any Subaru for that matter, is the amount of features which are "extra" on other vehicles.  The roof rack, front mud flaps, cargo mat, cargo area cover, storage cubbies, etc. are all things which cost you more on other supposed SUVs...vehicles you'd think you'd want the utility of these items in.  Our CR-V, for example, had not roof rack and it would have been $360 for the dealer to add one.  By the time you add all the extras for another vehicle that may have started out cheaper than a Forester, you're well above what the Subaru costs.

My only gripe with the Forester is that the back seat has a little less leg-room than I'd like.  We don't have kids, but we do travel with friends periodically, and tall people are a little cramped in the back unless the front passenger seat is moved up a bit.  But this is a minor annoyance, really, given the overall quality of the Forester.
