            The other reviews have covered this camera quite well so I would just like to add a little bit of my own insight.

 1) Bulk - The camera is a lot bulkier than most digitals, however I like the feel of a 35mm so this camera suites me well. If you want an easy to carry all around camera this is not it. However if you like the feel and heft of a traditional 35mm this camera might suite you too.

 2)The 2.5 inch LCD is awesome! My old 1.6 really stinks compared to this one.

 3) Disks can be interchanged at anytime. I buy a 10 pack of mini CD-R's and initialize all of them at once. They only take a few seconds each and then I have storage for about 600 to 3000 photo's depending on your resolution setting. 

 4)What's with tiff? I don't know of any online store that will except tiff files and they are enormous. They should switch to RAW if they want an uncompressed format on the camera.

 5)They don't really offer a wide array of lenses for the camera, just a few basics. For a serious amateur or pro this might be an issue. Also you need an adapter ring to use them.

 6) The battery can't be charged outside the camera. (Unless you want to buy a special charger from Sony for around $60) If you want a spare you have to take out the one in the camera then insert the spare to charge it. Charging spare battery = Pain in A$$.

 7) Menu's are easy and logically laid out. It only takes a few minutes to master the menu's on this camera. Sony has done an excellent job in this department

 Otherwise I love the camera, it takes sharp clear images, and depending on the resolution setting it doesn't take that long to burn them to CD. This camera has a 4x CD drive, an 8x might be a nice improvement. Battery life is good considering you are powering a mini computer. Also I took a tip from another reviewer and bought some of those pda screen protectors, I cut it to fit over the LCD, works great! Protects the LCD and images are still crystal clear!
