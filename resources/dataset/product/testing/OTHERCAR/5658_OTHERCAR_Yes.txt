            After writing a review of the Minilux, this is my second one. I sold my Minilux last summer to buy a Contax G2 (probably will be my next review). I wanted to go digital for a couple of years and found the quality so-so and prices fairly high. Anyhow, I bought this Leica 4.3 before Christmas and I carry it everywhere. Small, easy to use and it takes great pictures. It's fun to use and you download the pictures in your computer.

It's a different way to photograph, kind of polaroid on steroids, you can do an 80sec of video, which is kind of fun. I bought the Leica, I should say Fuji revised, because it's a Fuji with Leica dressing it up and for those who know Leica, when they dress up they are pretty good at it.

At maximum definition, you get 18 pictures with the card and probably zillions at a low definition (what's the use if definition is lousy). You can get cards with more memory but if you have a computer, you just have to download them and start again. It takes 2 batteries AA rechargable.

It doesn't replace 35mm for me because I like B & W and I like to have prints of 16 X 20 or 11 X 14. Optics are OK, but it's not so great for shooting architecture. To me it adds up to your regular photo equipment. 

I compared the Fuji to the Leica, the finish of the Fuji is not as nice, less memory, cheaper software but about 300$ less. Being a digital camera, it's not an investment in the sense of the regular M6 or all the other M's. In a year or so, a new one will come on the market with 6 or 8 million pixels and my toy will be obsolete. But for the time being, it's a pretty cool camera with lots of features that I probably will never use (time will tell).

What I like of this company (I don't work for them or even in that business)is that they come up with really cool tools, on one end you'll get the O leica which takes you back to the 1920s and you have digital. It seems that 30% of the company is now owned by Hermes (luxury brand), I hope that they won't play too much with the lineup, Ostrich-elephant skin-gold-stopwatch-cdplayer-goes-with-your-shoes-point and shoot camera.

Cool camera, nice design, easy to use, expensive but they have a really nice logo.
