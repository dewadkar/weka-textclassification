            One of my friends bought this vehicle a few months ago.  It isn't a Chevy Metro, but a Geo.  Its quite the econo car.

First of all, its not even an American engine, it came with a Suzuki 4 cylinder which pumps out an amazing 150 hp.  This car is quite the sleeper, faster than my 2.8 liter Blazer.  It definitely holds its own in a lot of races.

For the money, this car is ok, it has lots of pros and an equal amount of cons.  Its selling point, is the 45 miles per gallon highway.  This car is paying itself off while you drive it.  Along with the low gas bill, the insurance is equally low, I don't know the exact cost but full coverage is very low according to my friend.  The sticker price is low also, sporting a used price on a new car, I think this is why a lot of college students own this car.  It is pretty durable, my friend learned what a neutral drop was, and I thought he'd drop the transmission in a week, he's since stopped doing that and there are no ill symptoms.  The engine isn't crammed into the bay and looks easy to work on, but we haven't had to yet.  Despite its cramped appearance, this car is actually roomier than the Ford Contour in the back seat.

Of course, the obvious con is size.  This car is tiny, while it comfortably seats four people, it does not accommodate for their luggage.  A trunk in this hatchback is missed.  Of course there is always the embarrassment of driving this car, since the battery is larger than the engine, and the car looks like a little egg. I believe it would be as equally fragile in a crash.  The two doors make rear loading awkward but not any more difficult than any other two door vehicle.

I recommend this car to college students and people with a long commute.  If you are in the market, be sure to get a sedan with a trunk and the four cylinder engine since it doesn't impact gas mileage.

Kid Rock defines my friend perfectly as he said, &quot;I don't like small cars or...but I always seem to find myself in 'em.&quot;<br><br>
