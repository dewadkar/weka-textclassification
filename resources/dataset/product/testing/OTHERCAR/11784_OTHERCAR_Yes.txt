            I actually owned a 1990 Honda prelude and decided it was time for a new car; after all it had been 11 years since I bought a new one.  I didn�t go looking for the Prelude in fact I wanted something different and originally stayed away from the Prelude altogether.  I was looking for a sports car for sure and didn�t want to buy an American car; I wanted a car that would be reliable.  As I did my research on the internet and at dealerships I found that for me there weren�t a lot of cars out there I liked.  I was looking for a sports car with a unique shape and look different from the others.  There are so many Acura�s out there and cars with that exact look, that I quickly realized the only car within my price range and that wasn�t a 2 seater was the Prelude.  After a test drive and seeing the car I knew this was the car I wanted, despite my efforts to avoid buying the same car I did.  

There�s a lot to like about the car, its got a great look even better with a spoiler.  It gets a lot of looks in parking lots; outside my work I can see people pass by looking at my car as well as on the road.  In terms of driving the car is great handles amazing and runs real smooth.  Although it�s a little slow to accelerate it gets there and then some and is a very fast car and if your not paying attention you might find yourself going a little to fast.  As for the interior of the car, this is were than biggest problem of the car is.  The interior is nice but not what you really want in a sports car, it lacks that sporty look.  Also there aren�t many extras, mainly just your basic needs CD player, Heater/AC, Cig lighter, Speedometer, Tachometer, etc.  The one neat thing, which is a little different, is the sport shifter available only on the Automatic.  The sport shifter allows you to drive the car as if it were a stick shift just without the clutch, its kind of fun but to be honest not something I use very much at all.    The seats are nice nothing fancy and only available in cloth, no leather option.  The backseats are definitely small, you don�t want to sit back there if you are on the large side either tall or wide.  In fact the front seats can be a little small for the larger person as well, as for me they are great I�m only 5�6�, but a larger person may lack headroom and general overall space.  Trunk space is actually pretty good, not a ton of room but definitely not to small either.  Other features of the car are a sunroof; pretty much identical to my old sunroof I guess not a lot to change there really.  Keyless entry system is provided, one flaw with this is that the lights don�t flash or the horn doesn�t honk, so when you lock or unlock the car you have to listen for the sound of the locking.  This could be a problem say if you thought you pressed the lock button and didn�t and assumed the car was locked but in fact it remains unlocked.  

For me this car was the perfect fit, it had the look, power and reliability that I like at a good price.  I would not recommend it for everyone, especially if you are tall, I would suggest a test drive and see how it fits.  The car is definitely a stand out and Honda doesn�t make a lot of them, so they are somewhat unique.
