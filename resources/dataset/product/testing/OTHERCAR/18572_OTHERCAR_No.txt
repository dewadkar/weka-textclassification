            I'm a photographer and I bought this camera thinking that it would bring me well developed pictures and you know make me rich so that I would never have to work again (I thought this because I thought that I would get a lot of business from the well developed pictures).  But when I bought it the piece of $hit worked like $hit and I had spent well over $900 dollars on the f***king thing.  The pictures came out like $hit and I got no business what so ever from it, causing me to go broke and live with my parents again.  I tried everything to get rid of it. I tried to bring it back to the store that I had bought it and they wouldn't take it  back for some stupid reason.  I tried selling it to friends and even on the street and nobody wanted it.  I was even trying to sell it for only $300 to some other professional photographers, but they wanted nothing to do with it.  I even then tried giving it away to people and they wouldn't take it because they thought that I stole it.  If you ask me this f***king camera is nothing but a jinx and nobody should buy it unless you like wasteing money and going broke and live on the street.  I don't love anything about this product- it's worthless.  So after I tried getting rid of it and i couldn't, I decided to use a few times so that I could get something out of it from the money i spent on it. Then it screwed me over again!!  I had the best shots that I had ever taken and they were of swimsuit models.  Everything was going fine and then it just broke completely on me and I couldn't even use the film that i already had pictures on because for some reason the film had melted in the camera!  No joke!  Do not buy this camera I'm warning you! <br><br>
