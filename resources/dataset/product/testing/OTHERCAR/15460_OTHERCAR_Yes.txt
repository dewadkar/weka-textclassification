            I received the Sony Mavica FD-88 as a Christmas gift this year.  Our family lives across the country and wanted to be able to keep up with the growth of our baby, now 6 months old.  The features on this camera allow us to send great quality photos in email, but also video clips of up to 60 seconds.  This fun movie feature means that they can see and hear him! (It will be especially handy when he starts talking!)  I didn't think we wanted that feature at first, but now that we have it we use it often.

Another feature I really like is that I can change the resolution of the pictures.  With the lower resolution of 640x480 I can fit more images on a disk and the quality is good enough for email.  I can also go up to 1280x960 which works for images to be printed.  This is where it has come in handy for my business as I print up my own brochures and newsletters using these photos.  There is a middle option of 1024x768 also.

Other reasons I love this camera:  easy to use (my grandfather loved playing with it!), the self-timer, the ability to take as many photos as I want as long as I have disks available (don't need to download images to clear space, and can use the disks in multiple computers), the image on the LCD is very easy to see, and I can work it with one hand.  There are many other fun features like the black-and-white or sepia tone colorings.  The battery lasts a long time before needing to be recharged.

My friend who got me interested in digital cameras can't wait to upgrade from his Mvc-FD73.<br><br>
