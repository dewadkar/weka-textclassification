            Drivers looking for speeding tickets or for the thrill &amp; danger of a Porsche or Corvette will not be interested in this car. Anyone who wants real value for a small car, however, should be interested in the Chevrolet Prizm. 
This used to be a Geo brand, but GM failed with its half-hearted marketing aimed at younger drivers. GM now sells this as a Chevrolet model aimed at middle-aged women. What does this demographic imply? The Prizm is simply a sensible car that provides reasonable performance and no-worry ownership without depleting the retirement savings. Typical Prizm buyers don't buy cars to impress others, but this is a most impressive vehicle.

I say this as a former quality engineer at the California factory where all of these cars are built. The factory builds Toyota Corollas on the same production line with the same operators and most of the same components. In contrast to the depressing conditions when it was solely a GM plant back in the 1980s, the current factory (a joint venture between GM &amp; Toyota) uses the renowned Toyota quality management system. The engineers, line workers, and managers actually care about the quality of what they produce. Starting with the 1993 model year, the Prizm (and the Corolla) has been ranked exceptionally well in the prestigious J.D. Power survey of customer-perceived quality. The California factory also ranks highly against the Toyota factories in Japan, so even people who suppose that Japanese cars are superior have every reason to consider the Prizm.

This 4-door sedan would be a great buy just because of the 110-horsepower, 1.8L Toyota engine, power disc brakes, power steering, fuel economy, and solid unibody construction. The attention to details makes this car an unbelievable steal, however, especially when compared to the more expensive Corolla. The Prizm has a larger trunk than almost any other car in the class. The turning radius is even tighter than that of Civics and Saturns...a real blessing when I drove cars through the obstacle course at the test track. Many options are available on the Prizm that would often only be found on much pricier cars: power locks &amp; windows, cruise control, fold-down split rear seats, dual airbags, rear defogger, ABS, and auto transmission with overdrive. The car definitely benefits from the technologies Toyota has developed for the highly reliable &amp; upscale Camry and Lexus models. Quality of construction and the reliability of safety items (brakes, tires, etc.) is paramount, and the factory handles that well. Nevertheless, little things matter too. I don't think any other car company pays as much attention to engine noise, wind noise, and minor quality items like the alignment of the hand brake lever and the effort required to close the car door. All cars can break, but at least the Prizm factory is obsessed about quality.

After leaving the factory, I still decided to buy a Prizm (1998 LSi used from Hertz, under $10,000), and I have not been disappointed. I have driven a number of Cavaliers, Metros, Civics, Camrys, and Saturns. The Prizm doesn't feel as zippy as the Camry or some Saturns, but it is better than the cheap, hollow quality of the Cavalier and Metro. It is marginally better than the Civic, which to me still feels a bit cheap &amp; plastic. It is quite like a Corolla. 

Overall, the car performs well even in inclement weather or on snowy roads. It has decent acceleration and handles curves without much problem. If you are considering a car in this class, it has only a few disadvantages when compared to the competition. While the front seats are roomy, people over 6' tall may feel cramped, especially if the car has a sunroof. The rear seats may also be uncomfortable for tall people. Also, the fold-down rear seats are difficult to fold flat if the front seats are reclined or pushed too far back...not a tragedy, but a bit of an inconvenience. Some drivers may also prefer the console setup of the Corolla instead. The non-LSi version of the Prizm is extremely spare, and I would definitely recommend the much more comfortable LSi if you can afford the upgrade. 

The Prizm is an excellent first car, a car for the everyday commute, or a car for long distance travel. It's not flashy, but it will do everything you need it to do except tow a big load or get you a hot date. It costs substantially less than any comparable model, and it will also save you a lot of money on insurance and gasoline. All of this comes without compromising safety or quality.<br><br>
