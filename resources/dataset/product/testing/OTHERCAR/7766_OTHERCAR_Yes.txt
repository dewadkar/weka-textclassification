            First of all, I am not going to write about stats and numbers about the BMW 325, those can be found at edmunds.com, car magazines, etc. 
1. The base price is at around $29 US, but most that are available are loaded and price will carry from the upper $30's to low $40's thousand dollars. The "optional" equipment should not be considered optional since they are in every car that we checked out, such as leather, autoshift(clutchless manual), premium sound system, etc.
2. Now about the drive, although the car only has peak 184 hp, it feels torquey. A lot of power is made at low rpms which makes it feel more powerful from what I thought. The 5 speed manual shifting(clutchless) works so smooth. I was skeptical about it first, but this really is a clutchless manual. Although, it is not the "standard H" shifting pattern, the shift is done just by tapping the gear knob forward for upshift, and tap backwards for downshift. A full automatic transmission can be utilize if you don't feel like shifting. Just like any other BMW, the ride is smooth, quiet, and a luxurious experience. I barely hear the engine on normal cruise, and even at full throtle, the engine note is pleasing. 
The acceleration is strong, it can take hard cornering real well, thanks to its beefy Bridgestone tires.
3. Interior. Again, a classic with a touch of sportiness, and character. The cockpit looks pleasing and functional. The harman kardon sound system is superb. The seats are comfortable.
4. The tires are 17" with low profile tires which looks so much better than most aftermarket wheels. It fully complements the car's design.

If you are interested in this car, I suggest you test drive one. If you are set on getting a European luxury car at a reasonable price, then this is the way to go.
Otherwise, consider the Acura Type S, and Lexus IS300. Although "less refined", they offer more horspower for a few thousand less.
But with buying a BMW, you get several things that you can't put a price tag on.
When I think of; 
1. BMW = Luxury Performance
2. BMW = Exceptional Quality
3. BMW = James Bond 007
and most of all
4. BMW = "the ultimate driving machine" like in their commercials.

Acuras and Infinits have come a long way to produce "luxury performance" with high quality but I am still having a hard time accepting a luxury performance car from Japan. I still see cars from Japan as economical dependable cars. I am sure this is no longer true but for an analogy, would you buy a "luxurious" Hyundai Sonata? If you are reading this, probably not since you are interested in a BMW.

My conclusion, it is okay to buy a car because of brand, reputation, and just how it makes you feel. I really think the Acura Type S and Lexus IS300 offers more power, most of the comfort and quality of the BMW325 for a bit less money, BUT it will never make you feel how a BMW does.
Can you put a price tag on that? For those who have sat on the driver seat of a BMW knows what I mean.
