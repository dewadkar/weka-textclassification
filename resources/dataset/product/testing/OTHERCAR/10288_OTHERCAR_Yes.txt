            Imagine a car, small, low priced, rides well, is economical to operate and maintain, and you have to start commuting to Chicago. Well, while I didn't have all those requirements at first, that's what I needed in 1997 when I bought my GXE. And, 49,000 miles later, I'm glad I bought it. It was a good car for the long trips, what with standards like cruise control, but the armrest is too hard and made my elbow tender. And around town, it still is a good car. Starts every day, runs like a racehorse that's on steroids (relatively speaking) and is as close to a gas and go car as you'll find. If you slouch or have long legs your knee will hit the coffee cup holder when opened. Gas mileage, at around 30 mpg, is good, but not great for such a small engined car, I feel. But if you want a great second car, or first car for the kid, you can't go wrong with one of these.
