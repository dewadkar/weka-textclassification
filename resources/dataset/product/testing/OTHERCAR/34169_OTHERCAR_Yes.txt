            I bought my navy 1994 Camry (4 cyl) 5 years ago. I had owned a 1992 Mazda 626, and it stranded me several times, so I really wanted something dependable.  I also needed durability.  I use a car hard...I travel quite a bit on my job, and I have to drive on dirt roads a lot. I have to be able to get around in snow and ice. The Camry has met every challenge.

All in all, I have been very satisfied. I've been stranded once, (when the timing belt broke) in the 90,000 miles I've driven it. With the fold-down back seat, I've been able to get boxed 6 ft. bookshelves, bedframes, and other items my husband swore could not be put in a mid-sized car. The back seat is big enough for three people to sit comfortably. The driver's seat has excellent lumbar support.  Back problems I had with my Mazda (after driving an hour)  disappeared with my Camry

I don't think I've had to have very much work done on this car other than routine maintainence. I've had the timing belt replaced, the rotors replaced, and once, when I had some spare $$, had a complete diagnostic tune-up done. 
My mechanic tells me it should last up to 300,000 miles. 

This will be my son's car when he starts driving, and he's looking forward to it.  I'm happy knowing that he'll be in a durable, safe car. He's happy that it's easy to drive, still looks good, and is paid for. 

Now we're looking for a 1998 Camry for me, to take its place.
