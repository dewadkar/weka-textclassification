            I leased Altima in June of 1999, I do enjoy the car very much and for the money it has been good and reliable. It has decent power for a 4 cylinder car (150 horsepower, so the sticker claims) and the handling and susspention is not bad either. Let's just say, since I got the car it has been almost a year of &quot;Shake, Rattle &amp; Roll&quot;.

Since day one the drivers side window has had a lot of play and making the most annoying rattle I ever heard. To remedy the noise I have been tapping the top of the window with the palm of my hand pushing the open window into the jam. I have 5 people that work within my company with the same complaint, plus.....

Other problems I have had with the car include, coasting to the right(which the dealer thinks I'm crazy), squealing brakes, jammed power antenna, and just plain bad fuel consumption.

The car I had leased was the GLE model, which included; leather, moon roof, power drivers seat, doors, automatic trans., and CD &amp; cassette player..... so why not ABS? For $21000.00 you think they would.

All and all, I still think it is a good car for the $$$$$. I think it would be a good first car because it is easy to drive and reliable. And for me it is a commuter car for which I think it is perfect.

Good Luck	 <br><br>
