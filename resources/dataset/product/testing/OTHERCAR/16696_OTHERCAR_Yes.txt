            I bought this camera when I started homeschooling my daughter to record field trips and projects. It was an instant hit! It is a tough camera, I once set it on the bed of a pick up truck and the driver drove 15 miles with it bouncing around in the back & it works just fine! My 10 year old can even use it, and she is really excited about viewing her pictures right away. When we're going somewhere, we just grab a few disks and we're off. No more film! or developing!!!!! Instant gradification. I have taken pictures of projects close up with the macro lens and they are so clear you can pick out every detail. The floppy disks work so well I felt NO need to buy those expensive memory cards & EVERYBODY has disks, in case we would run out. I have copied disks of photos I have just taken and shared with friends, no more "can I have a copy of that?" 

One complaint is that any movement is blurry, which after talking to friends is pretty basic to all digital cameras. The other is that I would like to be able to get a telephoto lens for wildlife photography.
