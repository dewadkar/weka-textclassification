            I really love this car!  We leased the silver one, automatic, with a sunroof.  We almost leased the dark blue one (beautiful), but it would have been harder to keep clean.  

It took some time getting used to how low the body of the car is.  Keep in mind that I switched from a Chevy Blazer, which felt like a bus compared to this car :).  The first thing that really impressed my boyfriend and I, was its appearance.  It just looks beautiful - there is not another sporty car anywhere near its price range that I could compare it to.  I know that the reviewer above me compared it to the Cavalier, but I'm not sure that I agree because I find the Cavalier is much plainer looking.  This car turns alot of heads.  I have noticed alot of car owners and pedestrians staring at it :).  It's quality is also pretty exceptional, I heard that Hyundai had a very bad reputation in the past.  But if that's true, then they must have definitely improved.  The amazing details of the interior and the smoothness of the ride feel much more luxurious than the other cars I have test driven and been a passenger in.

The model that we have (SE) includes a sunroof, cd player, air conditioning, side window defroster, power windows and door locks, an alarm (not that it's much use, our insurance requires sattelite tracking since the Tiburon is at the top of car thieves' hit list in Canada).  I liked the fact that the model included all of these features, instead of us having to keep adding money to add features.  We definitely thought that features like the sunroof were going to be an extra charge.  

For the down side, is that it is a little "short" and cramped.  I am a tall girl (almost 6 foot but not quite), and the front seats are just right for my height.  But the top of my head is really close to the roof.  The advantage is if you are sitting in front, you can adjust your seat to be perfectly confortable.  But if you have more than one passenger, forget about it.  It is very unconfortable and there are warnings on the car for when you close your trunk because it can hit the back passengers in the head (I'm serious) :).  Only kids might be confortable with the space in back.  Also, it feels a little less safe than a bigger, roomier vehicle.  Again, I rode a Blazer for 3 years so it could just be that I am spoiled :).  But I do feel more vulnerable.  Then again, if you are looking for a very safe car, then a sporty car probably is not the best route to take anyhow.
