            My daughter's boyfriend works for the Toyota company in Canton, Ohio.  He moves new cars around in the parking lot and takes the vehicles to various places.  Last Thursday he was driving a brand new 2000 corolla on the highway.  He was wearing his seat belt in the corolla and was being extra careful on the highway due to the ice on the roads.  

He slid into a guardrail on the highway and it smashed the whole front end of the car.  He basically totaled the car.  However, the air bag never went off in this 2000 Corolla and the seat belt did not stop him from hitting the windshield.  My daughter's boyfriend hit the windshield with his head and broke the front windshield just from the impact of his head.  Then his nose hit the steering wheel because the air bag did not come out.  Luckily, he survived this accident, but even the cops were surprised to see that he did not need any hospitalization.  The police officer that was on the scene of the accident did not site my daughter's boyfriend due to the slick roads, he said that there was nothing my daughter's boyfriend could have done to prevent this accident.  

I was surprised to find this out about Toyota because every car we own is a Toyota.  I love Toyota but I would not recommend the Corolla's due to their lack in seat belt restraint and the lack of an air bag.  It makes me wonder how many defects our in cars that we own that we don't know about until we are put into a life/death situation.<br><br>
