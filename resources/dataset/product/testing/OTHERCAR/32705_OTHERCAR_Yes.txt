            With a growing family, I wanted a vehicle that could be more versatile than the Chrysler LH series car I was driving.  I had my eye out for one of these Expos, but since Mitsubishi stopped making them for the US market in 1995, this was a problem.  Twin vans included the Plymouth/Dodge Colt Vista and the Eagle Summit Wagon.  All the dealers in the state I live in not only did not have them, but they had waiting lists for people looking to buy one.

The Expo 4 door lists as a 7 passenger vehicle, but except for the 2 front seats, they have to be very small people.  I strongly recommend getting seat belt extenders (female ends) for rear and middle seat passengers.  Both the middle and the back seats fold down (50/50).  Controls are clear and easy to understand.  4 cylinder motor has a lot of kick to it.  Transmission shifts well.  Heater works well with rear vent to both back and middle seats.  Driver's view is comfortable.  High, but not too high.  The van is very easy to handle and easier to park.  It is shorter than most cars!  Gets excellent mileage.  Went from Green Bay to Minneapolis (a 5 hour trip) with a full load of passengers and cargo and got 31 m.p.g.  I have been able to transport a variety of goods that I previously had to pay for delivery or borrow a friend's truck for.  

If you can get your hands on one, nab it.  The only 7 passenger vehicle that Mitsubishi still makes for the US market is the full-size Montero, which comes for about a $35,000 pricetag.

You will love it.  It's the best car you'll ever own.  <br><br>
