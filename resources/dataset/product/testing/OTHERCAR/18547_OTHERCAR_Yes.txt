            Let me first say that I love this car. It has been in my family since we purchased it in 1997 and was recently passed down to me. As a college student in northern Minnesota, I drive around ten hours each way on trips home, but the car never gets uncomfortable. All I need is the occasional break and I'm ready for the road. It also gets great gas mileage; it only takes a tank of gas for the entire 400 mile trip. 

In the three years that I've driven the car I've found that it has great handling and is very responsive in tight situations. The car was formerly a rental and as a result now has nearly 160,000 miles on it, but continues to perform great. In the first several months that my family owned the car, we did have to make a couple trips to the garage, but only to catch up on neglected check-ups. But aside from that, the car has surpassed my expectations for it regarding performance, gas mileage, comfort, and dependability. I highly recommend this car.<br><br>
