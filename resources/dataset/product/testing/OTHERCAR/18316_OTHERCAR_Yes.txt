                  Let's see.I got this car because the way it looked. Than, I drove it. It blew me away. I couldn't believe that a car this inexpensive could handle so well. It had a set of....well, we'll say &quot;twins&quot; to be Politically Correct. I had all these teenaged boys in their Neons with they're stereo systems and racing stripes trying to race me, and I was blowing them away with my stock Eclipse.
         
             Another great thing, is add on parts, like exhaust systems, headers turbo's...etc. are installed easily. With very little effort, you can add, 20, 30 or more hp. As I stated before, the wide wheel base and low clearance keeps this car glued to the road. The tires are enormous compared to other inexpensive Japanese imports. Hey...if you're lucky you can get a hot girl to lick it for ya'...like my Heather. LOL  
          
          The interior is very comfortable, the bucket-seats cradle your body while taking tight turns. There is enough leg room for all 6'3&quot; of me. The radio, thermostat and other buttons and knobs are very closely placed to the driver. The large gauges are an added bonus. The only drawback is the very little leg room in the back. But, a fold down back seat increases the trunk space.

    As long as I've had the car, I have had very little repairs. It's easy to maintain, and the parts are cheap. I change the oil every 2,500 miles, and it is still running great. Bring on the Neons!!!!!!!!
