            I bought a Dodge Intrepid ES because I wanted a large safe car for my wife.  Our Car was owned by a former manager of mine and was always covered. I knew that the car would in pristine shape (which it was when I bought it).  The car is a 1994 ES with all the bells and whistles.  I paid about $12,500 for the car and it had about 36,000 miles on it. A great deal for a great car with low miles right?  WRONG!!!!

First problem: 42,000 miles (right after the 40,000 mile checkup no less) tie rod goes out causing the car to shimmy.  Dealer tells me it is because he rotated the tires without balancing them.  Luckily this was covered under warrantee, after a fight with the dealer. I make the cost about $200.00 because this should have been caught at the inspection.  

After the tie rod fiasco, a gear in the rack and pinion steering failed causing the system to clunk when it turned.  This was warranteed repair also.  Car spent most of 1999 either in the shop or in the garage awaiting repairs.
 
Second problem these are minor and petty.  Car misses due to a fouled spark plug.  Cost at dealer $160.00. (also had a light bulb replaced in the Liddy light) Repair done at dealer.

Problem number three: Water pump goes out on my way to a job interview.  Had to use potential employers phone to call a tow truck (after I told him I had reliable transportation).  Took it to my own mechanic.  HE replaced the water pump, front seal (which he said was leaking) (this also explained the slight burnt oil smell I was getting), timing belt, and a totally tweaked tension wheel.  Total cost: $600.00

Now the biggy: transmission fails at 52,500 miles.  Cruise control stops working and Air Bag light is on.  Dealer will not cover any repairs, not even airbag which is a safety issue on the order of faulty seat belts. Dealer quotes me $2400.00 IN LABOR ALONE just to fix transmission.  After argueing with the dealer and DiamlerChrysler (dealer threatened to have my car impounded as abandoned while I was dealing with DiamlerChrysler, how's that for 5-star service), I finally paid $1300.00 for all repairs.  
To top it off, I just recieved a recall notice for the transmission.  Nice huh? 

Drove the car today and the air-conditioner was blowing hot.  Hope this is not something major.

This is just a few of the problems I have had.  Other minor problems, squeaky brakes (had them checked, not low pads), transmission still shifts hard and jerks at starts and stops.  I don't think the tranny was repaired right.  
 
Long story short, if this is American manufacturing at its finest Sayonnara Detriot, Domo Arigato Tokyo.  I will never buy Chrysler again, especially from Napa Chrysler.  The car is a dud, the dealer will not back the product, and makes lame excuses and threats to potential customers.  My recommendation is to buy anything else but a Chrysler product, and I am also leary of the taint of Chrysler on Mercedes products as well.

Might as well list some likes: Styling, drives like a sports car (when it runs), like the seating position and placement of controls. Cruise controls could be illuminated for easier access.<br><br>
