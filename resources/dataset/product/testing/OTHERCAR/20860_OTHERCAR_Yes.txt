 If you are looking for a vehicle with a Nostalgic look, then this is the one for you. This vehicle has the look of a 1999 Chrysler Prowler, and a 1937 Ford Slant Back Sedan, and a 1950's Olds Woody. When I first saw this car I was driving down a side road and it went zipping by me so fast I didn't know what it was. But it did turn my head. It has a very distinct look about it. I do believe that the old timers out there will fall in love with it. It was developed by a very young person who tried to capture a look for everyone. And I do believe he did a very excellent job. You must test drive this one to really appreciate what I am talking about.

When I saw it in the showroom I was very impressed. The salesman was very helpful. I thought that the price would be totally out of reach. I assumed that it was in the range of $30,000.00. To my surprise I soon found out it was very reasonable for the amount of stuff that it had on the vehicle. The design sticks out so that you get noticed right away. So if you want to buy to get noticed you have found your car. This car has a lot to offer for a little money. Well that's if you call $18,000.00 a little money. That's what this vehicle costs stock. What does stock mean? Well, that means basic. But basic on this car is fully loaded on some other cars. This car comes with a lot of extras.

It has a 2.4-liter DOHC 16V 4-cylinder engine. 4 Speed Automatic transmission, Dual air bags (some models come equipped with side air bags), Anti locks brakes, 4 assist handles, automatic child proof door locks, power windows, the console includes dual reading lamps and compass and temp. reading monitor. Plus air conditioning and a digital clock, electric rear window defroster. Also Comes with special floor mats, tinted glass, extra interior lighting. Some models comes with power moon roof, also roof rack for extra carrying space, cap. of 225 lbs. I think that this would be better with a six cylinder engine.


The front seats, I especially liked because, they were the captains chairs that you see in vans. You get more of a cozy feeling sitting in these chairs. The back seats have a child seat anchoring system. The back seats also folds down and you can also remove them for more storage. The front passenger seat also can be removed in some models for even more room.

The dual side view mirrors are heated and fold away. It has a keyless remote entry. It also has a security alarm system that monitors just about everything. It has cruise control, tilt steering wheel, int. window wash, am/fm cassette stereo. Some models have a cd changer. In the rear you have a fold out table that you can have tail gating parties on. It will hold up to 100 lbs. Good for summertime cookouts at the beach.

Also included in this package is the fact that they guarantee this vehicle not to ever rust. It is supposed to be checked for rust after the first month that you have it. Then three years later, and then every five years after that.

The coloring on this vehicle is unique. It has a somewhat wide selection of exterior colors. The bad part about the colors is that there is only two different interior colors to chose from. 

This car comes equipped with a 15 gallon capacity gas tank. Estimated 20 to 25 miles per gallon. If you plan on trying to work on this engine, don't. Under the hood is nothing but wall to wall stuff. You couldn't squeeze your arm in there to work on it if your life depended on it. You will be lucky if you can change the oil on your own. Just remember that this is only a 4 cylinder engine, even though it is a totally new design, it still sounds like a 4 cylinder engine. The tires seem to be comparable to the best on the market. Good luck changing spark plugs. And if you have a really big family you can only fit four or maybe five people in this car. This car is roomy for a family just starting out. Not for large people. The design of the under body of this car is based on a Dodge Neon passenger car.

In order to get this car you first have to pay a $1,000.00 deposit just to order it. Which I am sure that everyone has that kind of money just lying around to hand over for someone else to hold on to, for a car that you are waiting on that you won't even be able to drive. Then you have to be put on a 6 to 8 month waiting list. Just to get the car. Then if you change your mind at the last second you are out the money. Or if the car comes in with any defects, then you have to wait more time to get it fixed. So the question still remains is this car really worth waiting for.

In conclusion, I have found this car a decently good investment right now. But seeing that this is the first year of this car, please beware that there might be a lot of bugs to be worked out of the systems. You will definitely have a lot of recalls. As all the new cars do. If you have a large family I would think twice about buying this car. I would highly recommend this car to a friend only if he wasn't to large and had a small family. One other thing I think that this would be a much better car if it had a six cylinder engine in it.<br><br>
