            I like many other motorists have always considered the offerings from Mercedes-Benz to be the likely choice of accountants and old ladies. It was with some reluctance that my wife talked me into visiting the Mercedes showroom.

However as soon as I saw the round headlights of the then just released E-Class I began reframing my thinking about this long standing quality marque. The salesman spent quite some time explaining the safety features (there are lots) and developmental ideas that had culminated in the production of this fine vehicle. After I slept on it, haggled a little I agreed to our purchase and sometime later reached for the cheque book.

The E is an elegant, easy to drive 4 door mid sized vehicle that is comfortable moving around any shopping centre car park. It also surprisingly shows  nimble footed highway ability. I took ours on a fast solo back roads drive and the handling was amazing. Apparently the suspension forks are turned to the front and this improves the handling. The 320 engine is a delight and achieves a nice purr when allowed to run over 3000 revs. The ABS brakes work very well and the driving position gives one a good view and sense of the road.
The interior is a little germanic, but is simple, elegant and not easily damaged by small children. The seats are comfortable without being too soft.
My wife loves the car, she has had two other 'Benz station wagons and the move to a sedan was a great thing for her as she no longer feels in 'total mummy' mode.

On the down side, I think the service charges are a little high and parts are definitely expansive. But that's luxury motoring.

For me, I still love the way it looks. On a sunny day when she is washed and polished it still brings a smile to my face, and that's what it's all about.
