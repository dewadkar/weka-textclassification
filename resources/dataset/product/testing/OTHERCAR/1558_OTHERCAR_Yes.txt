            We love your 1995 caravan.  Who knows, maybe this will change, but for now it has our hearts.  It has its problems ... its quirks ... its shortcomings.  But all in all its been a reliable quality automobile.

Problems:  If you want trunk space get the grand caravan, that's why they made it.  Either that or take out the back seat (actually you can slide the back seat pretty far forward, rendering it useless ... so might as well remove it or move it forward).  Also Dodge's of this era are known for their exploding transmissions.  So if you are going to buy one - buy the extended warranty.  We were able to get one with out 1995 within the last 6 months, you should be able to, at least with 96's forward.  It added a bit south of a grand to the total cost but it will be well worth it if we need it, and good piece of mind if we don't.

Quirks:  The seats could be a lot easier to move around.  The captain's chairs up front would have more accessible adjustment controls and the rear seats could be made much easier to move/remove.  But it is doable with one person if that person is relatively strong (and flexibility doesn't hurt).

Shortcomings: The heater just doesn't work as well as it should.  It does heat the car, and it does get the car warm ... but it takes took long and the air coming out of the blowers feels like a hot/cold mix.  Defrosts well though.  And while I realize the effects of this were not known at the time - the dual front air bags prevent my older child from sitting anywhere near the front passenger seat (which is good anyway for safeties sake).

Good things: comfy seats up front ... my kids don't complain about the back.  Good leg room in the middle row (not so great in back).  Lots of trunk room potential (when seats are out).  Towing package available.  Warranty still available on many models.  Good A/C.  Rear defrost and wiper.  Dual air bags up front (see caveat above).  Decent fuel economy.  Powerful V6.  Handles well in snow and ice.
