            I purchased the van new and the following things have gone wrong in the last 50,000 miles: 
    The air conditioning compressor has seized up twice. The first time it seized was at 32000 miles and the dealer charged me $620.00 to repair it. Shortly afterward, Chrysler came out with a letter stating that they knew of the A/C problem and would cover the repair cost. My compressor seized up again in less that 5000 miles and I went to the dealer (Hinkley Dodge Salt Lake City, Utah) They told me that it was true that the dealer would replace the compressor under warranty, but I would have to pay for new hoses and a receiver/dryer in order to complete the repair. The new repair quote with Chrysler paying for the compressor was $640.00!! I called corporate offices and after about 70 minutes on the phone(most people probably give up before this point) I contacted someone who could help. I had the repair done and resulted in me paying about $250 for my "free" repair!! A/C is not cold after the repair. I will take it in again to get screwed, OOPS, I mean repaired.(Hinkley Dodge is owned by the same prophet of the LDS church. Save you on Sunday, screw you on Monday!!!)
    Power steering pump making loud noise while engine running. It is worse when turning. Yes, my reservoir is at the proper level.
    Drivers side window doesn't go up some of the time. Very convenient!!
    The transmission shifts like a marshmallow and bucks and surges.
