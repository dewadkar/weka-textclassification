            The Mercedes brand has always been considered to have been of a high quality, and worksmanship, and it is, but this car more than any other in the range, has achieved much acclaim. To be considered an aristocrat if you drive this car in the UK, a successful businessman, one who's really done well in life. Some may enjoy the glamour, the attention, but it's the car that really deserves it. With it's somewhat circular headlights at the front and the intrusive metallic grill, the car has a somewhat uncompromising stance. Not being the shortest of cars, the practicality of the size may be questioned as for everyday use. However the car still does look really great.
The boot is large enough for groceries etc, and the interior is a little dull, but substancial, and on some models the fake wood looks a little cheap, when paying such a dear price for the car. However all the controls are close to hand, and an excellent CD player was provided, and other nifty gadgets are available higher up in the range.
One of the best things about the car is it's good handling and ability to seamlessly travel over uneven surfaces. The quiet and comfortable ride make the car an enjoyable, safe, and quiet, car to drive.<br><br>
