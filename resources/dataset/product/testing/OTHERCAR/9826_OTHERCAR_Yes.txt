            The chevt camero was a very good car. It met all its standards, It is comfortable to drive, it holds the road well around the turns. It is very economical indeed.The only thing they should have bigger engines.More horsepower,a little higher of the ground, so we wouldn't hook the muffler.They have tough motors.The car is a good  one I dont have a doubt about it. But the seats are a little hard, should be softer for more comfort.They should have bigger side mirrors,and a large trunk,as I find theres not enough space in the trunk,or the glove compartment.They are good vehicules,It's a pleasure to own and drive this car.Anyone who wants a vehicule like this should have one.great guarantee on it good gas mileage.<br><br>
