            I've had my Epson 750Z now for about 7 months. It takes excellent photos both in B/W and color. Easy to use right out of the box, superb battery life, came complete with charger, case, hook up cords for TV/computer, 8 meg mem. card, good user manual, etc. Just a well thought out product in most every way. I upgraded to a 32 meg card and shot all day long in &quot;High Pic&quot; mode, 70 shots with flash and still had 1/2 plus battery life!! You can even download/ print directly into some Epson printers, like my Stylus 800. I use mine for a lot of technical field training photo illustrations and am the envy and pride in my presentations. Don't pay the $700+ list, I found mine new for $525! 
One little draw back, watch where you place your finger to snap the photo, you could accidently place it in the B/W mode like it do from time to time.
Can't wait to upgrade someday to the 850. <br><br>
