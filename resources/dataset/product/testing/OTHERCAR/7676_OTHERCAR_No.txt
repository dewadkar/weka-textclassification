            When we first got this truck, it was very nice, solid, powerful, and relatively reliable. After about 10k, we started to have problems. Inside was squeaking like crazy, battery failed, transmission seal broke, rear axle seal broke, starter failed, water pump failed, A/C refridgerant leak, needed new seats, and brake rotors warped. I realize that we could have had a bad car, but from what I have seen with other reviews it sounds like people have similar problems. The worst part is the solidness. It is horrible after about 5-7K. Whenever you go over a bump, everything inside shakes and shutters for about 2 seconds.

The only major plus is its off-road capability especially with the locking rear diff. It is INCREDIBLE!!

I definitely dont think its up to toyota's standards of quality.
