            Pros: Hot styling, fast, fully loaded model has more options than a S600 Mercedes. I came from a '95 S class before buying this vehicle. CARS I LOOKED AT BEFORE MAKING MY DECISION: 
2002 Mercedes S430/S500: 2002 LS430: Used to have a 93 LS400. Great car, no problems. I wanted something different this time. 

Audi A8 - Nice car, too conservative/outdated for me. I hear the new one will be out in another year. 

2002 Jaguar S type: Nice, but too small. I'm still a little weary of their reliability, even though they have improved. It looked like they shoved a Ford radio in the dash. 

BMW 7 - same feeling as the A8. Again, new one will be out in about a month. Cons: Addicting speed can get you a ticket! 

New S Class- I was very disappointed. The interior felt cheap compared to my last gen. S class. There was too much plastic, less wood, cheap looking cupholders, cheap feeling storage bins below front seats that stick out and hit your legs, etc. The car drove great, but there was nothing to excite me. It's was $73k, didn't have Hid's, didn't have a CD changer, and honestly was bare boned. Everything is optional. The new S class: MB quality gone downhill - mbspy.bacosys.be/mbquality.htm Overall Review: Another thing that made my decision even clearer was this site: mercedesproblems.com - If you go there and select S430/S500, you can read customer complaints on the car. The same ones keep coming up - Navigation system turning off, on-screen display not working, electronics turning off, groan from wheels when turning, just to name a few. It's just not a reliable car. One thing that bothers me is how some sites compare the new Q to the E class, and 5 series, (much, much smaller/lighter cars). This has to be because of the lower price range, but if this car is in the same class as the LS430 like in all compairisons, it should be in the same class as the S class and 7 series. The Q is only 2 inches shorter than the new S class, and is 4 inches longer than the LS430. Cabin volume is about the same. 2002
