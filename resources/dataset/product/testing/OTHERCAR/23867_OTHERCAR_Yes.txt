            My driveway looks more than a little strange.  There are two large cars from 2002 (Chevy Impala LS and Ford Taurus SE) and then one midsize from 1992.  The 1992 vehicle is a Honda Accord LX.  My husband and I have always said that we are going to kill that vehicle.  That we aren&#146t going to replace it with anything until it literally stops and will not start again.  But as of yet, this has not happened.  

We acquired (or should I say my then husband) the 1992 Honda Accord LX in mid-1998 after his 1987 Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais finally went belly up.  It was a definite move up in the world as the old car had long ago been trashed.  The new Accord seemed like a beam of sunlight with the lovely &#147champagne&#148 (aka pink) paint job and sporty spoiler.  The old lady that had previously owned it paid extra for a few upgrades, so the LX was slightly &#147more&#148 than other LX models.

Even today, the exterior is in very good shape.  The exterior color is unique and the interior&#146s burgundy hue is warm and rich&#151plus since red is my absolute favorite color I wouldn&#146t ever complain.  The LX is also sporty.  It sits extremely close to the ground and while driving feels something like a very low powered sports car.  In some aspects, it is actually more fun to drive than my completely decked out Impala.  But this low profile has (of course) led to a host of issues&#151most notably the muffler which has been punctured twice on unavoidable piles of ice and snow.  FYI:  the ground clearance of the 1992 Honda Accord LX is listed to be just 6.3 inches.

Thus far, we&#146ve had no problems with the engine or any other important mechanical part of the car.  We&#146ve always maintained it properly.  We change oil every 3000 or so miles and also brake pads when necessary.  In addition, we replaced the timing belt at about 90,000 miles so as to avoid the inevitable issues and repairs that come with the breaking of that.  We&#146ve replaced the alternator and the battery&#151all routine things especially considering the car now boasts some 150,000 miles.  

Even now, over a decade after it was first purchased in the Detroit area the car is still kicking.  The engine is sometimes a bit sluggish to start, but I give it some leeway as it is rather aged.  Plus, we don&#146t drive it enough to give it a routine workout.  I think it would probably function better if it was driven a few times a week.  The engine itself is plenty powerful at 2.2 liters and a 4 cylinder.  It&#146s not exactly a powerhouse, but considering the car is rather small it doesn&#146t need to be.  It goes plenty fast and actually has significantly better pickup than my husband&#146s pitiful 2002 Ford Taurus SE.  

Often cars of this age lose their power locks.  Ours are gone, but it only happened after an incident I&#146ll speak about in a moment.  And often cars lose their air conditioning.  But this charming little undying vehicle still has functioning heat and cool.  The radio also would still work&#151but I pulled it out long ago so as to add a CD player.  The transmission is an automatic four-speed and save for a replaced cable (a minor fix) we&#146ve had no issues.

Really, all the rumors are true.  The 1992 Honda Accord LX (which is in fact the mid-level of the line) is a great car, even now.  And if you can get your paws on one that is under 100,000 miles for just $2000 (or so) you&#146ve got yourself a great deal and a reliable vehicle.  I&#146m not keen on the 2-door style, but if you don&#146t have any need to be in the back seat then it is fun&#133and you can&#146t go wrong with the super-functional fold-down seat and built in 14.4 square foot built in luggage capacity.  

As far as gas mileage goes, it is good but not great.  The tank holds 17 gallons and the car purportedly gets 22 MPG in the city and 29 MPG on the highway.  This, as compared to my much more powerful and much larger Impala LS isn&#146t that impressive, but it is however good enough to make drivers happy.  Speaking of highway driving, our Accord has lived through many trips with too much weight and the like.  But it has also lived through a particularly nasty run-in with the deer where the animal literally fell out of the sky of us on 696 outside of Detroit.  We hit it&#151and the car&#146s windshield and entire left side was shredded.  The car lived.  The antenna (mounted on the trunk) nor the interior clock nor the automatic door locks were ever the same&#133but she&#146s alive these four years later.

Overall, we&#146ve been decently impressed with the 1992 Honda Accord LX.  The car still looks good (save for a little rust in the rear wheel wells and a dent on one front quarter panel) and runs well.  It still gets good mileage and run decently well with no real repair costs thus far. A definite good, safe choice for parents of teenagers and budget conscious drivers.
