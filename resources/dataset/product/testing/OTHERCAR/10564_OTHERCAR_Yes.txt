            After much research, I decided to buy an Integra. I bought a 1995 White Aucra Integra Sedan Special Edition Manual Transmission. First, I recommend the manual, it makes this car so much fun to drive. I have owned it for around 6 months now, and my heart still beats fast when I take this car to over 100MPH with ease on the freeway. I got the Special Edition, which has everything, and the LS 140hp engine, but If i had more money, I would by the GS-R, which has a 170hp VTEC (soooo fast) or even better teh Type-R which is hard to get, but is a racing car made legal. I highly recommend the sedan version of the Integra, it's much more roomier, specially if you have a lot for friends. The inside is very well designed, you could fall asleep in your seat. This car handles so well, brakes, accelorate great etc. And so efficient with the gas!

If you are looking for a can with the right mixture of sedan and sports car, around $15000, get an Integra, you won't be disappointed!<br><br>
