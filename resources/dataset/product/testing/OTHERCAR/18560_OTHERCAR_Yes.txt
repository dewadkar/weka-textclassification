            I am only 20 years old and am now on my third automobile, but I have had my 1995 Chevy S-10 pick-up truck the longest of anything and must say it has been the best to me.  My basic situation is this, I am either driving from home to school, or school to work, both which are over 40 mile expressway drives, and I just don't think this truck could be any better for that.  I have had it for over two years now and other than a few oil changes and washes, have put no work into and had ZERO problems with it.  It is a little loud running and could probably use a new muffler as of now though.  It is a manual transmission so it is awesome on gas if you don't mind driving a stick, handles well, looks cool and has never given me grief as far as breaking down or starting cold in the winter or any of that junk.  Being a rear wheel drive, a little extra caution is required when driving in snow, but sand bags help and i've always stayed outa those ditches.  I have heard people rag on the generation of small pick-up trucks  like S-10s a lot, but honestly, if you don't rag on them, be nice to the clutch, and just keep them up with minimum maintenance, you're going to have a great car that is awesome for frequent movers, expressway commuters, and economic college students like myself.
