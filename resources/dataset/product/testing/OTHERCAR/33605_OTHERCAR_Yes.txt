             I thought my 1992 did too. I had nothing but bad luck when i first bought this car, just like the mechanic in NJ i had problems with the brakes immediately. The rotors were always needing replacement, the only brake pads that would work were the original ones from ford(cost a bundle). Things then went well for a while, then i met a girl at work who had the same car, she told me she had to put it in the shop because it was overheating. The next day she advised me she would have to pay $1000.00 to replace the head gasket. Not soon after that my car started overheating also, i brought it to be looked at and the same thing happened to me, mine was $800.00. 
I could see if we did not take care of our cars and keep up with the maintenance, but we did. We decided to write to ford to tell them of our problem seeing that both mechanics told us they could not count how many 
Head Gaskets they had replaced in Mercury's of that year, but we got no response. I think that Ford should have at least responded with an explanation, but i guess we are only Important when we are buying the car not afterwards. Since then i switched to Chevy and have been having really good LUCK!!
