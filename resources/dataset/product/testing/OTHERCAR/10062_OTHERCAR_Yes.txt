            Get up off that couch,get outside and get into this vehicle.  The Xterra is built for those type of people who want to get up and go.  To put it simply it is not your average SUV.  

While the style looks good, the Xterra is built to play.  Built on the frame of the Frontier truck, it is an SUV that is meant to be a truck, not a large car.  It's V6 engine give it plenty of pick-up and go, and has great towing capacity.  I enjoy passing all the cars and trucks going uphill, headed across I-70 in the Rocky Mountains.  

It has a large wheel base and solid frame design that makes this thing on of the safest cars on the road.  Included is the ABS system and a few other nice features that makes your insurance agent smile (translation, when I got this, my insurance went down compared to my truck).  The Xterra come in either 2WD or 4WD, but I wouldn't recommend getting on without 4WD.  This SUV is just too much fun not to take it into the backroads and offroading.

One great thing I love about this vehicle is that on the road it drives like a car.  It handles very nice and smoothly and almost just seem to glide across the road.  By far this is the best vehicle I have ever driven.

Finally, the Xterra overs some nice unique options.  The back seat offers stadium type seating to those sitting back there can see over the front seats.  The Xterra's design includes a timing chain, titanium tipped spark plugs, and self adjusting valves.  That does this translate into?  According to the dealer, the only maintenance you have to do is change the oil until the vehicle hits 106,000 miles.  If this is true, you will save a lot of money by not taking it into the shop for a long time.  Oh yea, the luggage rack is a great addition.

To put it simply, this is a great vehicle to own.  You will feel safe, save money, and have fun.  With all the features you can basically customize your own car and have everything you want.  If you can afford it (and this is one of the most affordable SUVs out there) then you can't go wrong with the Xterra.   <br><br>
