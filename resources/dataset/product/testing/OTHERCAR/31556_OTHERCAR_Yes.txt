            what a great utillity vehicle the volvo 240 estate is. a versatile seven seater with a massive carrying capacity with the rear seats folded down. although the fuel economy is not great i think this is a small price to pay for comfort, practicallity, and of course brilliant towing ability as the volvo has bags of torque for this most demanding job. the comfort levels even at the base model end is very good although a leather interior is always the best bet. reliability is great even in my eighteen year old model so the running costs must be equate quite well. all in all a very versatile motor car and ideal for all familys.<br><br>
