            First I would like to mention how pleasurable it was to purchase a vehicle from <b>Warnock Dealership</b>. If you have one near you rush out and get an automobile from those guys. They are courteous and very honest. The whole buying experience from the time we came into the door and to the time we drove out took exactly 2 hours. I have never had such professional attitude from everyone in a dealership.

Now let us get to the subject at hand, our new <b>Durango</b>. If you are on the market for a new SUV, I can not imagine how you can pass this one by. When you look at the overall package it is the best buy on the market today. I am not just speaking from my experience. Some of my friends have purchased other SUVs and they are not as satisfied with their overall buy as much as I am.

<b>Standard Features</b>
8V Magnum Automatic Transmission
4.7 Liter engine
2-wheel drive/4 high wheel drive/4 low wheel drive
4 Wheel ABS
Front Seat Air Bags
Power Doors
Power Windows
Keyless Entry
AM/FM Cassette Stereo
Clothe Seats

<b>Optional Features</b>
<i>Rear Air Conditioning</i> 
A must have when you are taking your family for a ride.

<i>AM/FM Cassette CD Stereo</i>
How can you survive without the CD now days.

<i>Side Bar</i> 
Since my wife is pregnant and my mother has the hardest time getting into one of those things, this is one of the greatest features that I could put into this vehicle. The step is very sturdy and a great option.

<i>Alloy Wheels</i>
Without those babies the truck looks puny and unattractive.

<i>Third Bench Seat</i>
If you have a few kids and considering getting a Minivan, think again. This truck has a third seat and is great for taking the family out. We have already tried putting the kids in the back and they loved it, because that seat is a bit smaller and is perfect for their little legs.

<i>Window Rain Guards</i>
Well, usually I do not purchase those. I feel they are too much money for the purpose that they actually serve, but in our case they were already on the truck and the salesman just asked us if we wanted to keep them. We didn�t pay a penny extra for them and I am glad that we have them.

<i>Leather Package</i>
That is the only option we didn�t get. My wife never liked leather seats and for the price that they want for it, we didn�t feel it was necessary.

<b>Decision Making</b>
We have test-driven a various number of vehicles. Sure you can find the one that will beat Durango in quality and in comfort, but what are you willing to scarifies. We have tried Mercedes and Lexus, which are great but way too pricey. We have driven in Pathfinder, Forerunner and Jeep Cherokee. How can you even compare those three as far as the power, comfort and size is concerned to our lovable Durango?

After test driving Durango, our main concern was to get the best deal we can. When we came back the guy didn't jump on us with the numbers, but suggested different alternatives and options. Our edge was that we found out exactly how much we should pay according to the down payment we were willing to put down. Once we have decided on all the proper options the rest was a clear sail. Yes, sail that is how smooth that was, like being in the calm ocean.

<b>Price</b>
<i>The dealer sticker price:</i> around $32,000 for the one that we got
Since we usually lease our vehicles the pricing was slightly different.

<i>For the vehicle we got with the options specified earlier the deal was:</i>
Down Payment: $3,500 - that includes first and last month payment, security deposit, tax, bank fee and registration costs. 
Monthly payment: $331.00 based on the period of 36 month at 12,000 miles per year.

<b>Conclusion</b>
I have never liked Chrysler and I thought that their cars were not of the best quality, but boy did my mind change when I talked to people and drove this beautiful SUV. This is the best buy for the money as far as comfort, power, gas, price, size and as I can sort of predict durability. We have already tried it in bad weather and the big puddles seemed like a breeze. If you are on the market for a great looking and efficient vehicle in that category, I urge you to look at this truck before going anywhere else.
