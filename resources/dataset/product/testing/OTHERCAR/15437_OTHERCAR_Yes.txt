            The first time I saw a Sony Mavica (an FD7), I was hooked.  I knew THIS was the digital camera for me.  Why? Because it stored the images on floppy disk.  Some have said that floppy disks are a poor format because they have limited capacity and require high compression of the images (the Mavica line, in generally, stores images in JPEG format).  I say, however, that floppies are inexpensive, highly portable, and universal.  Almost every modern computer has the capability to read a floppy.

I had originally planned on purchasing an FD73, the base model.  As I learned more about the Mavica line, my desire began to move upward, but my wallet held me back.  Luckily, I was able to get an end-of-model-production price of just $100 above the price of the 73 - a difference I could afford. (If you're interested, the replacement for the FD88 is the FD90).

Other factors that affected my purchasing decision were zoom length (8x optical/16x digital) and floppy drive speed (4x as opposed to the FD73s 2x).  I never considered any other type of digital camera.

The newer Mavicas now have the ability to use the Sony MemoryStick as record media by using a floppy disk adapter, thus increasing their record capacity before a media change.

This camera is so easy to use, it could easily satisfy anybody from amateur to professional.  Although, professional photographers tend to use it as a snapshot camera and the FD91/95/CD1000 seem to be geared more toward pros.

If you're looking for a camera to take and keep digital photos, you can't get much easier than the Mavica.  Large prints tend to come out a little grainy, but everything looks fantastic on screen.
