            I rented the fully loaded sedan for a couple days. My biggest complaint by far was the steering and steering wheel. The power steering at times felt somewhat removed, like driving in an old video game. I like to be able to feel the road at least a little, and I like some resistance in the steering wheel based on how far I've turned it. The steering wheel itself needs to be able to telescope out, because it was very awkward for me. Either the gas pedal was too close, or the wheel was too far, I could never get really comfortable. Did they build this thing for gorillas? (short legs, long arms) Quite ergonomically terrible.

OTHER COMPLAINTS:

� The seats are kinda stiff.  Your butt starts to complain after awhile.

� The cupholders looked so weak and flimsy that I was almost afraid to use it for fear of breaking it.

� Acceleration is passable for basic transportation, but a little weak anyone wanting even the slightest bit of "oomph".


REDEEMING FEATURES:
� I was surprised at how much passenger and trunk room there was for such a small car.

� the ride is nice and smooth for its size too. That kinda surprised me.

� The controls and buttons in the car were pretty easy to figure out because of nicely designed icons and placement.

� The CD player and speakers had pretty good sound.
