            If you live in the city, but love the occasional road trip, this is the SUV for you! I had a tiny Honda Prelude for years, but when I was ready to move up to something bigger, the Honda-CRV was the perfect fit. It gives you tons of room, but is still small enough for easy city parking and maneuverability. Plus the gas mileage is decent, compared to other SUVs. I usually get about 18 mpg city, a little higher for highway driving. I drive to Tahoe a few times a year, and the CRV provides for a very comfortable and safe ride. I love the fact that it handles like a car, but you're sitting up higher, like a truck. In my low Prelude I used to always get blinded at night by on-coming headlights, that's no longer a problem in the CRV. Of course, if you want a serious heavy-duty truck-like SUV, this is probably not the car for you. But if you want something that's easy to maneuver, spacious, and comfortable, than go for the CRV.

I really have nothing bad to say about this car. I've been 100% satisfied since the day I drove it home from the dealer. <br><br>
