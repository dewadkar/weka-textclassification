            Since I'm a total novice when it comes to photography and digital cameras, I took the time to research digital cameras before buying the Sony DSC-S50. 

My main concern was about the quality of the resolution. As a former Kodak employee, I knew that the clarity of digital pictures hadn't always been as good as film-based images, but I hoped that things had improved during the last few years. After buying this camera and seeing the quality of the images, I know that they have. These images are crisp with rich color and suitable for email, Web usage, as well as printing. 

What separates this camera from other digital cameras is the quality of close-up shots; I've been told that the Sony Cybershot has a great zoom capability and I would agree. Both close-up shots and those at a distance come out clear, even when printed. 

The camera is easy to use and enables you to see your image right away, which is great at special events. At $500 street price, it's in the mid-range for digital cameras - not too expensive, but not in the range for professional grade cameras.

The software you get with the camera is also fantastic, making it possible to brighten and crop with ease. The memory stick that holds the images is so small that it fits almost anywhere and the battery on the camera is long-lasting.

The only thing that could be better is if it came with a nice carrying case, which it doesn't. All-in-all, a great camera well worth $500.<br><br>
