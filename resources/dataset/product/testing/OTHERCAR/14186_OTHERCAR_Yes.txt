            Ever since the original LHS hit the roads, I had my eye on this car.  The Sportiness of it, yet the luxury size was appealing.

I found this little gem at a local dealership after seeing it online.  When I went in, I had not ever been inside an LHS.  After the test drive, I was drooling over all the options.

It had about 20,000 miles, but drove like it was brand new.  It's roomy - both front and back (which was important to me), leather/power seats, has ABS and Traction Control, Digital Information Center, Cruise control (With Cancel, unlike other makes/models that require OFF or tapping the breaks), AM/FM/Cass. with a 3rd party cd changer in the trunk, and a power sun/moon roof.  And the trunk is so large, it can carry 3 or 4 suitcases.  It also comes with a full size spare tire.

The back seat has it's own vents for a/c or heat and it has a pull-down armrest.

My only complaint was that the rear windows don't roll all the way down, but I've been told that can be changed at the dealership.

After owning it one year, it now needs some moderate service work.  The ABS and Traction control don't work (and the lamps stay lit), the &quot;Auto drivers side window down&quot; function doesn't work and one power door lock doesn't work intermittently

This is a car for a person that wants a sports car, yet likes having the features of a luxury car.  I'm very proud to drive my friends around in this car.<br><br>
