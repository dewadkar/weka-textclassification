            I researched every vehicle in this compact (and subcompact) class and the Sentra SE was by far the best value.  The selling point for me were the 4 wheel disk brakes which you cannot find on any other vehicle in this class (i.e., Civic, Corolla, Protege, Focus etc.).  In my view, braking is the single most important safety feature.  Combined with the ABS, this car has superb stopping power.  In Canada at least, it is only $1000 CDN more than the Corolla, which does not have 4 wheel disk brakes (or a sunroof, keyless entry or foglights).

Moreover, the power of this car is incredible for the money.  The 145 hp engine has great acceleration and a wonderful mid-range.  Yes, the top-end is not mind blowing, but that's a trade-off for the 39mpg (CDN) hwy.
Combined with the big aluminum wheels and dual stabilizer bars, the handling feels like something from a much more expensive sport sedan.

In fact, if you read reviews on the 2001 Infiniti G20 (e.g., Edmunds), the &quot;cons&quot; mentioned include the fact that the G20 has the power and feel of a 2001 Sentra SE (they both have the same 2.0  litre engine)!  Not great for G20 owners, but fantastic for Sentra owners.  

The Sentra does have a luxury feel with all the gizmos and the funky black on white gauges.  The sunroof also deserves mention, as it retracts into the roof or tilts upwards.  The stereo is fine for a car of this price -- only audiophiles will be disappointed.

The other cars in this class feel sparse and underpowered in comparison.  They really feel like economy cars, especially the Civic which has an anemic engine (117hp in Canada) and a boring interior.  In fairness, it is about $2500 CDN cheaper, but not worth the savings in my view.  

Another important point is the comfort of the front seats.  The driver's seat is 8-way adjustable and very comfortable.  Compare with the Corolla that put my leg to sleep (cutting off blood circulation) after 30 minutes of driving.  The Corolla seats just do not support the leg properly -- they are about 1 inch too shallow for me anyway.    <br><br>
