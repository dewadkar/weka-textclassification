            I recently purchased a new 2000 Chevy Cavalier Z-24. It's a 4 cylinder, 4 speed automatic and it gets very good gas mileage and is still very responsive. It handles very well and is fun to drive. I especially enjoy the power sunroof. The only thing negative thing I can find about this car is that it is a bit pricey and the factory stereo could have a little more power. Overall I've enjoyed this car very much. I would recommend this car highly to anyone who enjoys a sporty and economical vehicle. I have driven it on trips it is quite comfortable.<br><br>
