            I had a 1989 Nissan Sentra. It was a COMPLETE opposite of a lemon. It was the greatest car. It got excellent EXCELLENT gas mileage. We'd fill up once driving 1-5 from Sacramento to San Diego.  

I think 1989 was a good year for this car-if you are into the used car market.  Some cars DEFINITELY have more of &quot;lemon&quot; years for their cars...and better years....this was one of the better years for this car.

I did the basics on this car-and had an extended warranty (which I rarely had to use).  I got the oil changed regularly and the tires rotated...and I would have kept this car until it died...if it was not for my back. After my secondborn, my back was killing me from reaching into the backseat to lift the child and do and undo the carseat. (I had a 2 door).
IF this had  been a four door...I would have definitely kept it! It was a GREAT GREAT car. I cannot rave about it enough.

The only down side to this car, is I used to worry about its safety factor because it was such a light car.  It had great manueverability. It was easy to drive it around, easy to move it into parking spots and out..things like that.

GRRRRRRREAT car. What more can I say?<br><br>
