            I bought this camera with the intention of carrying it around all the time for those spontaneous shots that pop up all the time. Unfortunately, it's not a good camera for that. It's fatal flaw is how long it takes to actually photograph a subject. Sometimes it takes as long as two seconds after pushing the shutter button. If you have the time to wait or take a lot of still life photos, this isn't an issue. The pictures seem fairly decent especially considering the low 1.3 megapixel resolution. It has perfect exposures in bright light. But in less than ideal settings and even with the flash the pictures turn out a little dark and flat. When indoors, don't use the zoom. Move closer to your subjects. You can easily outdistance the flash.

Another thing that appealed to me was the video capture. This camera can capture four or so seconds. It's a nice feature. The short bursts force you to be creative. What you can do with the minute, low-rez AVIs you can download into your computer is limited. For me the value was replaying them for people on the camera screen. 

This camera has two slots which can be used for two compact flash cards or one flash card and a modem card. The modem allows you to send pictures to friends, family or a business. AP photographers in the field do this all the time. I never used this. I always used two flash cards. You can also use microdrive which will increase the usefulness of the camera tenfold.

My biggest complaint is the photo modes. This camera doesn't offer an uncompressed picture format. It saves everything as a JPG which is a lossy compression. This means the picture quality, even in the highest modes, will suffer in quality. Depending on how picky you are, this might not matter. But if you want to blow pictures up to 8 x 10" the loss of quality will be even more apparent than the low 1.3 megapixel resolution. 

Overall, the camera is easy to use and quite compact. The controls are plainly marked and the menus easily navigable. It uses batteries fairly quickly so my recommendation is to buy two sets of Alkaline rechargeable. One in the camera and the other in the charger.
