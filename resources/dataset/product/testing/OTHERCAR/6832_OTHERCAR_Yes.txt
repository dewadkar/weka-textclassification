            My wife and I checked out cars when she decided to go back to grad school (meaning a 35 mile commute from Denver to Boulder).  We tested a few cars before deciding on the Subaru for it's AWD value.  Plus, we had a good number of neighbors that had more than one Legacy in their driveway.

After 7 years I can say this has been [knock, knock] one very reliable car.  There was one bit of minor unscheduled maintenance with the battery wire (some advanced thing that was beyond a cable) which I had assumed was a dead battery from a week of below freezing temps in Denver, but my mechanic quickly identified it.  It cost about $100.  And we replaced the timing belt at 60,000 miles for about $300, but that was scheduled maintenance.  And that's it.

We found the car handles well even in snow (though new 4 season tires improved the performance when the originals wore out).  Since that time, I've bought myself an Audi A6.  (This was AWFUL on snow 'till I replaced the tires.)

The biggest downside of the car is that the 4 cylinder engine is pretty weak.  150 horses or so.  That was more than my Datsun years ago, but the Subaru weighs in almost twice what my Datsun weighed!  That means the engine downshifts a lot passing and going up grades, which is made a lot worse by the general straining sound of the engine.  With newer Subarus you have the option of a larger engine (which I recommend), but not on the older models.

A few comparisons.

Compared to a Taurus.  Before the Subaru the wife drove a Taurus (company car).  We also bought the cheapest Legacy (the Brighton).  The interior is cloth (okay) the ride is a little noisy (middle of the road) and the seats moderately comfortable.  Perhaps the Subaru is a little less comfortable than the Taurus.  But the Taurus required a new transmission at 7,000 miles!!!  Meanwhile, the Subaru has been running strong for over 70,000 miles.

Compared to the Audi.  On the minus side, the Subaru handles a little less precisely (lighter and different tires, though), it's louder, less comfortable, doesn't have nearly the stereo, no automatic door locks or power windows. On the plus side, the interior space is almost the same, the car also has AWD, the bumper clears the concrete markers in parking lots without tearing off the front bumper, and cost half the price of the Audi.  Face it, the Legacy just isn't a luxury car.

But all in all, I think the Legacy is a hell of a value.  This summer when my Audi lease expired I looked at Nissans, Toyota Camrys and Subarus.  So perhaps the strongest recommendation is that I just bought a 2003 Subaru, turning us into another 2 Subaru family.  However, for the second Subaru, I chose the more luxurious 3.0 liter Outback, with leather seats, a great stereo, and all the little bells and whistles, nut that sells for almost $10,000 more.  If you're looking for a luxurious car, I  recommend the 3 liter (Eddie Bauer) Outback, I think it's much nicer and will hold it's value.  But if you're looking for a cheaper vehicle, the Legacy is a great choice.
