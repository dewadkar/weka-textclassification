            I am currently leasing a 1998 Jimmy SLE 4-door 4 wheel drive. I have not had one problem with it in almost 30,000 miles. It drives well, handles more like a car than a truck, is a quiet ride with plenty of pickup power and is &quot;sure-footed&quot;. 

Although SUV's as a whole are purported to be top heavy and easily tipped I have never felt in danger of rolling during any normal maneuver. I bought a Jimmy because I initially liked the exterior styling of the GMC over the Chevrolet but after riding in an almost identical Blazer I have to say I prefer the interior of the Jimmy. 

The only slight complaint I have about the Jimmy is the performance in snow while in four-wheel drive. It seems a little skittish in the rear while turning. That could probably be rectified with a little extra weight in the back, but all cars have some sliding while turning on snow covered roads. 

This truck is excellent for a family of four, the back seat may be a little crowded for a family of five. The cargo space is more than ample, the amenities make it feel like a luxurious ride for under $30,000.<br><br>
