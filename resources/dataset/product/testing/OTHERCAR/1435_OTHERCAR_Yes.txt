            This is my second Range Rover so far.  My first was a 1996 4.6 HSE that I had purchased used in 1998, under the Land Rover certified used vehicle program.  I had not been interested in Range Rovers initially, but after my first few days with the old one, I was sold.

In anticipation of the new model, I sold my old Range Rover last fall and put down my deposit on the new one, specifying Black w/ the Cherry wood interior.

If you've never owned or been driven in a Range Rover, the first impression you get is one of well-built solidity.  The 2003 didn't disappoint in that regard.  It is an imposing vehicle, slightly larger than its predecessor.  This sense of size continues when you are seated inside it.  It feels very roomy.  Driving it, however, does not give the impression that you are driving as large or as heavy a vehicle (~5500lbs).  It turns easily and has, subjectively, a better turning circle than the older models as well as brisk acceleration.

I have few complaints so far, and most of them tend to be fairly minor.  So much is done right on this vehicle that there's really not much about which to complain.

<b>Engine & Powertrain</b>

The BMW-supplied 4.4 liter engine is quite powerful, but it has a lot of mass to accelerate.   I've noticed that it can occasionally be a little sluggish in regular driving.  Attempting to accelerate on the freeway, for example, will usually have the transmission dropping down a gear.  I imagine that future model years will up the horsepower, most likely the engine will be replaced with a retuned Jaguar V8, or possibly the Aston Martin V12 as an option.

The engine is a little bit louder that I'd like, but in reality, it's very, very quiet.  Most people coming from another vehicle would not notice this, and probably the only reason it's discernible is because the rest of the vehicle is so quiet.

<b>Ride / Comfort / Interior</b>

The seats are very supportive, the dual-temperature heating in them is welcome on cold days.  The steering wheel also incorporates a heated rim, which sounds silly at first, but is something you appreciate the first time you get into a cold car on a freezing day.

Wind noise is remarkably low, and road noise on a variety of surfaces is virtually nonexistent.  This vehicle rides more like a luxury sedan than anything comparable.  Land Rover engineers have done a sterling job on the suspension.

The controls are well laid out and easy to operate without glancing down.  In particular, the climate control is intuitive and effective.

The woodwork...Amazing.  Pictures don't do justice to the feel of the cherry or walnut in the interior.  Probably the nicest interior I've ever seen in a vehicle.

The Audio and Navigation system is integrated into a single lcd monitor on the upper part of the dash.  The Audio system sounds *great*.  It's easily the best audio system I've had in a vehicle.  It utilizes the Harmon Kardon Logic 7 sound system with a 525W amplifier and 5.1 channel sound.  Very full sound, excellent imaging and tonal range.  Apparently it was designed to play back DVD's through the onboard monitor, however as of right now, no US models are equipped with this.  It may be available on European / global models.

<b>Ownership</b>

Insurance costs seem reasonable, given the price of the vehicle.  It's equipped with eight separate airbags and a well built chassis to isolate the occupants from most conceivable accidents.  Subjectively, you feel very safe in this vehicle.

It's a dream to drive, this one hasn't been off road yet, but I never found a place my old one couldn't go.  This is purported to be even better off road, so I'm looking forward to so steep muddy trails later this year.

<b>Drawbacks</b>

This is a *heavy* vehicle.  Even though the engine and drivetrain are fairly efficient, you're moving a lot of mass around.  Don't expect to get more than about 13 mpg around town, up to about 19 on the freeway.  If fuel economy is at all a concern, you shouldn't be looking at this vehicle, or, for that matter, any large SUV.  Things may change if they ever go to fuel cell / electric hybrid, but until then, be prepared for the fuel costs of this vehicle.

The vehicles are all equipped in the U.S. with tinted windows for the back seats/ rear window.  Personally, I don't care for this, but was told by the dealership that it was not possible to obtain without.  Almost all of the literature shows vehicles with clear windows.
The headlights (xenon) are nice, but the high beams don't seem quite as bright as my other car, or for that matter, my last range rover.

The Navigation system?  Horrible, horrible, horrible.  It is by far the *worst* designed user interface I've ever had the misfortune of using.  I can't imagine how it could have possibly gotten past quality control.  I work in the tech industry, and yes, I could, as a matter of fact design a much better system.  It is the one glaring flaw in an otherwise wonderful vehicle.  It makes poor use of the physical buttons on the unit, for example, rather than a designated 'map' button, you have to navigate through three or four separate menus to simply get a map of your current position.  Contrast this to the unit in my other car, which only requires pressing 'Map' to instantly bring's up the appropriate display.  In addition, when most automakers have gone to DVD based systems which incorporate the entire country (US) on a single disk, this one is based on very dated CD technology, requiring 6 disks to cover the US.  It is also *slow*.  There is a noticable lag in the menus, etc.  In short, it's so aggravating to use, that I rarely use it.  In theory, something like this could be fixed with a software upgrade.   In all fairness to Land Rover, it was probably something that resulted from their brief ownership by BMW.  I think this is the same horrible system that is installed in some BMWs.
