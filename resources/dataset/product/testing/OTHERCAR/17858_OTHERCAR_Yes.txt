            The 2000 Chevy Blazer LS 4wd is a good buy for someone who wants low price 4wd suv. At $28,545 it's not exactly cheap, but it's also not expensive compared to other suv's in it's class. It's powered by GM's tried and trued 4.3 V6 which is basically a 5.7 350 with two less cylinders. This engine will run forever with basic maintnence. The Blazer is also roomy enough to be used has family vehicle, and it's also rugged enough to be used has a off road vehicle. The 4wd system is very easy to use, 4LO is for very nasty terrain (soft dirt, mud etc...), 4HI is to be used for a little extra grip, everyday driving it should stay in 2HI. This Blazer also makes a very nice highway cruiser. It dosen't sway to much in cornering but I wouldn't push it to hard unless your a professional driver. If rolling the vehicle scares you, the 2wd version costs about 3,000-4,000 cheaper. The Blazer comes in 3 trim levels, base, LS, and LT, LT is the one with leather seats, auto a/c and a lot of other luxury items all standard. So anyone looking for a fairly low price 4wd suv should take a look at the 2000 Chevrolet Blazer.      <br><br>
