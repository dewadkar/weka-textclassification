            I did a lot of research and it came down to the Olympus and the Kodak DC 4800. I opted for the Olympus for the Quicktime Movie mode, which the Kodak lacked.

I have taken over a thousand photos with it and have been impressed. It takes great photos. The menus are a bit cumbersome, but for simple point and shoot it is fairly straightforward.

The only thing I want to add has to do with the Quicktime Movie Mode option. When there is enough light, it works great. However, you really do need a significant amount of light to get a good video. I think it shoots at 1/30 speed. With an indoor video you need a lot of light to get it coming out good. I really enjoy the videos but beware, you're going to need an awful lot of light to use it.
