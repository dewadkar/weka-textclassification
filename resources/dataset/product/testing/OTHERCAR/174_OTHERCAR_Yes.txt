            I've been a old die hard Rolleiflex SL35 camera user, believing that for best result for picture quality and color was the 35mm camera.  Three weeks ago, my better half (wife) bought me the Fiji MX-1200 for my birthday.

At first glance, I wasn't too keen on what appeared to be a small camera, having seen small digital camera in the past. I figured it would be be sent back to where my wife purchased it.  I snapped a few pictures and was hooked on the easy of operation and the clarity of the pictures and the color quality is better that my Rolleiflex.  The cable and software with the camera is easily loaded into a computer and no other equipment is required to get perfect results.  I am highly please with the Fiji MX-1200 digital camera.  One great advantage is that I don't have to wait for the film to be processed and not more finding that the photograph I really wanted didn't come out.

The enclosed software allows you to correct dark pictures in an instant and transfer them to a decktop publishing program.  <br><br>
