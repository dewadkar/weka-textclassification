            I was driving my '81 BMW since it was new and was just pouring money into it to keep it running.  I knew I wanted a small SUV and had been searching all of them.  My search kept taking me to the Honda CR-V.  For months I would search the internet, go to dealerships and resale lots.  I read Consumer Reports and Edmunds.com reports.  Again, I kept coming up with the CR-V.  I was going to buy a new one, but a wellknown financial guru recommended not buying new, but buy a used car 1-2 yrs old, because of the the depreciation.  

I bought a red 1998 LX 5 speed manual, 4X4 wheel drive and I love it.  It is very smooth and has much better get up and go than the automatics.  It is very roomy inside and the radio sound quality is good.  The cruise control is great.  I sit alot higher now and can finally see on the road.  The car does have some blind spots, especially with the drivers head rest in place.  The gas mileage is good, especially when the A/C is not running.

I cannot wait for the first snow storm to see what everyone is talking about.<br><br>
