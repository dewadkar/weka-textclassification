            Although I've used other people's digital cameras, this is the first I've owned. And I'm having a ball with it.

It's easy to use, and it's got a zoom lens! Eventually I'll stop turning it off instead of zooming while peering through the viewfinder. (The two switches are too close together for stellar design.)

However it works, it makes me look like a better photographer than I am. I've been delighted with the quality of the pictures, even when I set it to the lowest quality for web pictures.

The battery life seems reasonable - particularly when I quit playing and reviewing all the time. 

The display screen works great indoors or in low light and is totally useless if I'm outdoors during the day. So far, all my pictures are better than they were displayed on the screen - a nice surprise.

Included software makes downloading to my computer if not a snap, at least truly acceptable. I use the corded connector, and am looking at adding a picture card reader.

A good, but not cheap, first digital camera.
