            <i>This review is part of the Roadiem write-off.  In memory of our good friend.  I am already missing my Yooper brother!!!</i>

So what does your normal everyday, run of the mill, wolfman drive?  What else could he drive but a Lincoln?  There is no other car on the market that has the style and power and grace that this one offers to the owner.  So this is the vehicle I drive around in when I can get my wife to let loose of it!!

It is funny that this topic was chosen for the write off in a way.  Mike (roadiem) and I were discussing my ride a little over a month ago.  We were talking about our driving up north to visit when he asked me what kind of car we had.  

When I told him, he kind of laughed.  He said it wasn't a Yooper car.  That's for sure.  Not good in snow, or off road and the back seat is too small!!

That is the way he was.  Always joking about whatever we were talking about.  That is why I think that he would want me to make this review as humorous as possible.  But he would also want it to have as much detail in it as I could put.  He never wanted to let any information be left out that would help someone looking at the product in question.

So, why do I love this car.  Well first off, do you know those sleek, fast Mustangs the police are using now?  Well this car has the same 5.0 engine in it.  This means that there is plenty of giddy-up when you want it.  At least this part of the car Roadie approved of!!  

As a matter of fact, it is really funny to pull up to a red light and watch the kids in their machines as I leave them in a cloud of dust!!! 

But that is not the only reason to own this awesome machine.  If you like electronics, this car is a gadget lovers dream.  From the digital dashboard, to the outside temperature and directional indicators, this vehicle is like sitting in the cockpit of an airplane.

But one difference between it and the airplane, you will have fully adjustable, leather seats!!  This is the best ride that I have ever found in a car.  The only thing to remember, if you get the black...watch out on those hot summer days!!!  Leather gets very, very warm!!!!

But one thing that you have to keep in mind with this car.  It is a luxury vehicle.  That means that it is going to be expensive to repair and run.  It really runs best on premium fuel for one.  I just had to replace the exhaust system and it was almost $400!!  It is an expensive car to keep on the road.

The only other drawback I can find is that there is so much electronics in it, something is always going wrong.  The great factory stereo system is always having one of the buttons stick or the tape won't eject or something else.  There is never a serious problem, just annoying ones. 

But when the stereo system is operational, it is very dynamic.  The car is so quiet to begin with, the 5 speaker set up could melt earwax!  In preparation for this review, I took a little trip and threw on Kenny Wayne Shepherd.  I knew that Mike would appreciate this.  It was then that I realized that he is always going to be with us.  Here I was in a great car, yes Mike did like it even though it was no good in snow, I was listening to some great blues and remembering a great friend.  Talking with Chris the other day, she said that their daughter was going to the Kenny Wayne concert with her in Mike's place.  I am sure that Mike would have wanted it that way.  His family enjoying his favorite music.   

Also the power mirrors, windows, seats, etc.. In very cold weather have a tendency to freeze.  This can be another problem when you have more than one driver and have to adjust these things.  The only thing that Mike could help me with here is, in his words, "Put it in a garage or move south."  Yeah Mike, like we decided, who needs to see where they have already been anyway!

But all these little bugs aside, there is little that would keep me from owning another one of these.  I still get a kick out of all the fun I have with this car.  It handles better than even the little sports cars I have owned.  It is one of the most roomiest front seats that I have ever seen.  Everything about it is made for comfort.

Some of the features that I have never seen before I owned this car are truly amazing.  Like the automatic headlight dimmers.  This is a feature (if you can get it properly adjusted) that will automatically dim the headlights when another car approaches.  Don't ask me how it works, cause I do not have a clue.

Another great feature is the automatic leveling system.  It is like having shocks that are constantly adjusting themselves according to the road conditions.  This makes for one very smooth ride.  When I was talking with Mike, this subject came up.  He said that this was for keeping the car from scraping when we put our troll (his term for those of us below the Mackinaw Bridge) women in the vehicle.

I also like the trunk.  You do not have to shut it all the way.  Just push it down and it will close by itself!  This is very handy when your hands are full.  As Mike would say, "Great for getting rid of the bodies!"

There is also an on board computer that will figure out your trip distance, miles remaining, average fuel consumption and a multitude of other things that I have not figured out how to use.  This comes in handy for long trips.  I always like to know how far I am to the end of the journey!

One other feature that comes in real handy is the auto headlights.  They are always on.  But they also stay on for a preset length of time after you shut the car off.  This is great when you get home after dark.  You will have a light to get the front door open!

One last annoying thing that I just remembered.  The buzzers!!  There is a buzzer for open door.  There is a buzzer for keys left in.  There is a buzzer for low fuel.  There is a buzzer if you have been driving for a half hour.  On some trips, I would just like to rip that sucker out!!


One recommendation that I would make on this car.  I have seen most of the colors that it comes in, get the black!!  It is by far the best looking of them all. (Except when a flock of geese use it for a port-a-john, like we had happen once!)

Well, all in all, this is one of the best rides I have ever been in.  The good outweighs the bad by a hundred fold.  I would buy another of these cars in a flash if something happened to this one.  It is truly a driving experience!!!

Mike, I just wish you were going for that cruise in this car like we talked about.  But in a way you are, I know you were there listening to Kenny with me the other night and you will be there on many nights to come!!  Good-bye old friend, I am going to miss ya!  

I would like to thank all that are participating in the write off for my cherished friend roadiem.  I am going to miss him a bunch and I know that his family appreciates all that we can do for them.
