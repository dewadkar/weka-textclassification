            Man what can I say that hasn't already been said! This is the mother of all trucks!
I bought this truck because I pull a 32ft fifth wheel camper that I live in...as I only move maybe once or twice a year I needed strength and economy. I got strength and economy with this black beauty.
I got  mine used, of course who can afford a new one! It is a 1999 QC 3500 Sport Cummins Turbo Diesel with every available factory option except automatic transmission. I looked for over 4 months before I found just exactly what I wanted.
I love the fact that I can safely pull over 10k lbs with out so much as a whimper from the Cummins diesel, and get over 12mpg pulling and close to 20 empty. I have comfort beyond what one should expect with a light duty truck. This is not your grandad's old farm truck.
The only, only, trouble I have had in 24k miles is a few little paint problems that DC has taken care of under warranty. It seems that there is a problem with the paint but as long as they keep fixin it...no problem!

There is some engine noise from the Turbo Diesel that is disconcerting to some...could be alleviated with a little more insulation...I love to here that diesel whine!<br><br>
