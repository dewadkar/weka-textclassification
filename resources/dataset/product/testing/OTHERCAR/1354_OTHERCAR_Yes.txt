            I have a 1999 Chevy Silverado Z71 with 5.3. This truck is like unstopable, I have used this truck to it's fullest extent and it has plenty in reserve. Before buying this truck I went out and really tried the main three truck companies, first was a Dodge 2500 Ram, other than the total lack of power, during the test drive...the front driveshaft just fell out! Second I leased a 1999 Ford F350 Superduty , with all the bells a whistles, Ford claims it will pull over 10,000# trailer...wrong!!! After having the trans replaced 3 times and the oil seals in the turbocharger replaced, it filed for a lemon law. Finally I had come to my sences and bought a Chevy. The power is unbelivable, I have to say Chevy has always had the best trucks in my opinion, This is the only truck that I know of that when in 4WD high, you mash the gas it leaves 4 tire patches 30 ft long! It will eat up any Full-size truck on the street. I pull a 9,600# trailer with this truck, and It pulls it like it's not even there, even pulled the trailer though thick mud, This truck will just not give up. Don't get me wrong it has it's factory defects like most production trucks do.
But after finding a good dealer that would listen to me, I have to say, I will never look at a Dodge or Ford in the same way again!
