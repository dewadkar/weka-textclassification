            I am a "soccer mom".  We just purchased our new 2003 Tahoe about a month ago.  So far, we are in love!

We are not a wealthy family by any means.  We were able to purchase the vehicle using the GM Family program, as we have a relative that works for a former GM company.  That saved us some money.  We ended up paying $32,000.  

We don't have many options on the vehicle.  We have 4WD, third seat package, and the 6-disk Bose CD changer.  I was pleasantly surprised with the list of standard features.  The keyless door locks are a necessity for us.  The ride is very smooth.  And, the vehicle "feels" heavy, which is a comfort in driving in the ice and snow.  Acceleration is excellent.  If you need anymore, you probably shouldn't be driving like that.  Parking has been a bit difficult to get used to, but it is getting easier day by day.  

Getting in and out of the vehicle is very easy, including the third seat.  It is nice not to have to mess with the headrest (it automatically folds down), the seat folds down quickly and easily with only two movements.  It is a bit of a step to get into the third seat and the leg room is a bit minimal, but it works great for kids.  I also like the LATCH system for the car seat.  The car seat is immovable.  I have a standard car seat in the center seat; and I can still fold the seat down for access to the third row.  It is also very easy to fold the third row forward for storage in the back of the vehicle.  Once again, two movements and the seats are folded forward and there is plenty of room for groceries and such.

The stereo system sounds great.  It is very loud;  and the automatic volume adjustment is nice when driving in the city.  The climate control center is great.  I tend to be much cooler than my husband, so it is nice to be able to turn the heat up on my side.  The air controls for the back seats are also nice.  The back passengers can control their own temperature and air flow.  

There is one nice feature that may or may not have been planned.  The center console in the front seat can hold 4 drinks easily.  This is nice, when there are small children in the back that "can't have the food or drinks until we get home".  

I know this review is not very technical.  I am a mom.  I use my car everyday, all day.  It is very workable and dependable for us.  It gives us room and safety.
