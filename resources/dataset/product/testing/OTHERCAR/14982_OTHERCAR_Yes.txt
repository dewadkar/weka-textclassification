            I checked out the opinions on this site before I bought this camera. 94% positive. I am very impressed with this new toy of mine. I am defineately technically challenged and I hate to read instruction manuals. I can't say enough about how easy this camera is to use.  I was also told by a camera expert that the most important thing to look for in a digital camera is the zoom. The mega pixels can always be updated on most cameras by buying a smart card but the zoom is important, especially for out door vacation scenes. This camera has a 10x zoom!!!! It stores all of your pictures on a regular computer disc. They cost about 35 cents each. As you take pictures you can view them right away and decide to delete or save them. I am also not the most organized person in the world, but thanks to this system of storing pictures, I am now very organized.  I just stick on a sticker when my disc is full and then number it, date it and write a small description of what pictures are on each disc. I have mine set on fine, so I only get about 23 pictures on each disc. I get better quality pictures that way. I recently took photos at a cheerleading competition and they were very helpful at catching some mistakes the squad was making in their motions. They went on to correct them and won the competition. It comes with a rechargeable battery too! I think it last for a long time, I think 250 min. At first I thought it was a little expensive, I paid 479$ but circuit city had a 100$ rebate, so I actually only paid 379$ When you think of the cost of film and processing I guess it pays for itself in a short time. The most fun is being able to e mail pictures to far away friends and relatives. You pop in the disc and click on my computer then click on the 3and1/2 inch floppy.It displays all the pictures on that disc you can either delete them or send them just by clicking on file and send as e mail. That's all there is to it. The floppy disc works in almost all computers too!. Another thing I have been using it for is to take pictures of collectables that I am selling on the internet. I have received many comments about the clarity of my photos. I am rambling on I know but If I can use this camera anyone can. I hope this was helpful to all of you out there. You will love this camera!!!
