            This is a great camera.I bought it on ebay.I had two other cameras,a polaroid, and an rca.Neither did the job that this camera does.This is a great camera for web tv.The pictures are great.The only real thing bad is like all digital cameras it eats battery's.So i bought a ac adapter on ebay.The camera is easy to operate and fun to use.The thing I like is the way you can view your pictures right away.The screen is large enough to see if it's good or bad.Also the way you can blow up any part of the picture is great.You also can bring up 9 pictures at one time,or print the hole view of all 9 pictures.again it's a great camera and fun to use.       <br><br>
