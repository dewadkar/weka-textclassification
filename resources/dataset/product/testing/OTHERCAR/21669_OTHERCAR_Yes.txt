            The Toyota 4Runner is definitely a quality vehicle.  It is well made, safe, roomy and comfortable. In effect, it is a Toyota.  However, my husband and I wish we hadn't bought one.  Not because it isn't a great vehicle, but because it is just not the right one for us.  An SUV is great for off-road driving, but we don't drive off the road, and the gas mileage we get in our mountainous area leaves something to be desired.  I believe that the 4Runner should get about 23 miles to the gallon on the freeway, but if you are driving up and down hills and have an automatic transmission, you will get about 15.

The four wheel drive is great if you are using it, but if you hit a patch of black ice on the freeway, it is no help at all.  What it is good for is getting out of mud and climbing steep embankments.  We bought our 4Runner thinking that it would be a much safer vehicle on the icy roads, but it is not really too much more effective than a solid vehicle with front-wheel drive.  I mention this because ours is in the shop right now with about $10,000 worth of damage from just that type of accident.  Granted, I was driving slowly and the damage is mostly superficial and thankfully, I was not hurt at all (which is possibly due to the fact that the 4Runner is well built), but you shouldn't make the mistake of thinking that this vehicle will safely hug the road in all situations.  

The 4Runner handles turns very nicely and doesn't give you the feeling of travelling at great velocity like some of the smaller cars do.  We have had quite a bit of trouble with the tire alignment and the rear anti-lock braking system kind of jars when we brake too quickly, but some of that may be due to the treatment it received before it came into our hands.  

There is a lot of cargo space in the back, and the back seats go down to allow for even more space.  This comes in very handy when we are toting around our four bulldogs, but we could probably do just as well with a station wagon.

My point here is that although the 4Runner is a very nice vehicle, it is expensive and perhaps more than most of us need.  You might want to consider your reasons before going out and buying one.<br><br>
