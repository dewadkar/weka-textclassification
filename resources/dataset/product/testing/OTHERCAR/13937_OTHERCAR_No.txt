            Our family has this car and it is kinda nice. It rides smoothe, is quiet, and has good pickup. For some people it may be the ideal car, but for our family it has fallen short of that. However, here are some downfalls:

the car is low to the ground and scrapes on many driveways, ramps, etc.
not enough legroom in back
emits strange odors
constantly needs service
defective arm rest and cupholder
side panels rub agaist legs and are uncomfortable.

i would reccomend this for a family with young children, but once they grow up its kind of a hassle. there is just not enough space. we are rather tall (3 of us over 6'2) so i might be biased. otherwise, it is a sporty, fun vehicle. although you may think it is a bad car from the defects i listed, i still give it a B.
