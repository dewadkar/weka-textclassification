            We bought a new 1999 Cabrio as a fun car for the family - for occasional use on nice days. Overall the car is very well designed and constructed. For a convertible, it's extremely solid - showing much attention was paid to the design of the body.  We particularly enjoy the heated seats - even on sunny days believe it or not ! After a day of working in the yard, that warming feeling on the back is quite soothing with individual controls for passenger &amp; driver.

Now the issues.
Both my wife and I feel the stereo is horrible. Tinny and lacking any kind of fullness. I'm starting to think maybe there's something wrong with it. We've had Taurus's and Explorers which all sounded significantly better.
Our daughter - who rides in the back doesn't like the car much. After 5 minutes at nearly any speed - she's miserable and ready to have the top up - which obviously defeats the purpose and expense of having a convertible. The wind buffeting ruins any chance of her enjoying the ride.Consider this if you plan to have back-seat passengers of any age or size. 

Lastly - beware the warranty statements. When we bought the car, the Dealer sales people AND SALES BROCHURE said &quot;12 years unlimited mileage on corrosion etc&quot;.  It's NOT TRUE - it's only 6 YEARS. In my opinion - We were frauded and probably weren't the only Cabrio buyers duped in this fashion. All other VW models have 12 years but the Cabrio only has 6 - regardless of what you read or what you were told. For the 2000 Cabrio, even the Owner Guide says &quot;12 years&quot; - but it's a MISPRINT as far as VW of North America is concerned. Send me a note if you want to discuss it further.<br><br>
