            As an owner of a 97 Outback, I was pleased to see that Subaru is still working on improving a good thing.  I recently test drove a year 2000 Outback and here is what I found:

1) Improved handling.  There was significantly less sway in curves, and the wheel feels tighter and more responsive.
2) Quieter ride.  This was perhaps the most noticeable element to me. 

     Aside from that, nothing much seems to have changed.  It still achieves roughly the same amount of horsepower from the 4 cylinder boxer engine.  

     On the downside I was not too thrilled with the Outback's new skin.  The 97-99 models appeared somewhat sportier with their cleaner lines and hood scoop.  

***Here is something you might want to consider though.  There is word that Subaru will introduce a six cylinder engine for the Outback Limited in 2001.  It will be similar in configuration to the 6 that was used in the Subaru SVX sports car.  That engine was capable of 220 horsepower.  I would really suggest waiting as it will offer greater acceleration and torque.  <br><br>
