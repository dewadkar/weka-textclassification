            After a long and hard battle with trying to keep my 1989 Acura Legend coupe alive, it hit the point where the cost of maintenance exceeded the value of the vehicle.  This after putting about $2000 into the car in the last 8 months of ownership.  Once the car stranded me at the train station for the third time, I decided it was time for a change.
I was looking for something in the $10-14k range, and one of the key factors was a car that I would not have too many worries about parking at a public lot and fear it wouldn't be there when I got back.  I researched Toyota Matrix, but it was too expensive.  I then looked at the Corolla, but the engine was too weak, and by the time I put some options onto it, it was going to be well over $14k.  I also considered the Nissan Altima and Maxima, but they were also priced well above $14k for a 2000+ used model.  Honda Accord and Acura Integra were strong recommendations, but the theft rate was too high.  So, while perusing the Acura Dealer's inventory, I stumbled across a poor orphan, a red 1999 3.0CL

After a quick test drive, and a review of carfax, I decided to purchase the vehicle.  One of the main factors was that it was an Acura certified pre-owned, so I have 1 year/12k "bumper to bumper" coverage, and powertrain coverage up to 2006.  After worrying about starting and driving my Legend for fear something else would break, this certainly provided a nice peace of mind.

The car has ample power.  The 3.0 engine is very smooth and when it is at a stop, it is hard to tell if the car is even on.  Brakes provide some confidence as there is little fade.  Handling is good, not the best I have experienced.  I have to be a little careful on offramps, as the tail tends to swing out if I'm not careful.  In Acura's defense, the tires are Michelin's and I think they are all seasons.  The only weakness I have seen so far is the automatic transmission.  Step hard on the gas pedal, and the first to second shift occurs with a sharp jolt.  Driven at a more leisurely pace, and the car shifts nicely.  I will have the dealer check this behavior to make sure that all is normal.

Interior creature comforts are everywhere.  I certainly could not find a car in this price range with leather, ABS, sunroof, BOSE stereo (although not the best stereo I have heard), keyless entry with alarm, alloy wheels, power seat/windows/locks and auto climate control.

This car is really fully equipped, nice and powerful, and in a way invisible.  And that's the nice part.  I was looking for a nice, semi-powerful, everyday vehicle which I would drive around and not have to worry about parking anywhere.  This car won't cause traffic to stop, and people don't seem to be interested in this car, especially when there are Integras and Accords nearby.
Incognito, even with an exterior color of milano red.  Perfect.
