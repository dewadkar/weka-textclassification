            The 95-99 Monte Carlo is a beautiful vehicle. My car turns heads like a much more expensive sports car. After 1 year of driving it, though, I'm putting myself on the waiting list for a Toyota Prius!

I don't think this car is very practical for many people, but it can be irresistible because of its looks -- beware! 

My review is based on my particular model. I have the Z34, which has a 3.4L V6, leather seats, ABS, and lots of other goodies.

Things I like about my car:
* very comfortable for long rides (I have a 65-mile, 1.5 hour commute one-way)
* lots of storage capacity -- especially with the fold-down rear seats
* all controls are easy to use and reach
* good-looking car (especially in red)

Things I don't like about my car:
* only seats 2 comfortably; back seats are difficult to access
* brakes are weak; seems unsafe for a car of its weight
* poor packaging resulting in expensive repair ($500 for an alternator, because of the labor costs)
* not enough torque (sluggish in city driving)
* battery is under the washer fluid reservoir (who designed this thing?!)
* sloppy handling
* timing belt is expensive maintenance (Chevy dealer quoted me $1000!)


A few months after buying the car, I moved from the upper peninsula of Michigan to the San Francisco Bay Area. I have found that this car does not meet my needs now that I'm in an urban area. U-turns are sometimes impossible, it is difficult to park in a crowded lot, and the fuel economy is not good in city driving although acceptable on the highway. I am also very concerned about the costs of maintenance because anything under the hood is difficult to access. This should be a concern for anybody considering buying a car of this age. 

In summary, don't buy this vehicle if you live in the city, have more than 2 in your family, and don't have a lot of money/time to spend on your vehicle. <br><br>
