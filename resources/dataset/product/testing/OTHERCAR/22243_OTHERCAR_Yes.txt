            As the title states I am not an owner of this car but I took a rather lengthy test drive of this car.  I took part in the Ultimate Drive that BMW runs and got to drive among other Bimmer's, the Z3-2.3.  I was alone with the car for about 45 minutes on all sorts of road conditions.  Wow it quite a fun car.  I am no stranger to fun cars (see my review of the 1994 VW Corrado) and this car doesn't disappoint during the summer months.  It was a 5-speed version which I think is the only tranny in the 2.3.  The fit and finish perfect, although I would expect no less for a BMW.  The shifter was quite tight, but a little rubbery.  Overall, it was great going through the gears though.  The suspension was also well tuned.  A firm ride without being uncomfortable.  The seat were good and the foot wells were quite deep so that people who aren't too tall under 6'2 could be comfy in the car.  I didn't like the engine though.  It was slow, not very responsive, and didn't have a exhaust note indicative of a sporty vehicle.  I was very disappointed with the response of the engine.  A lightened flywheel would work wonders for this baby.  Torque was lacking as well.  So I think that everything except the engine was fantastic.  It was very quiet with the top down at 80mph.  A very capable car for the person who wants a fun vehicle but isn't looking to light up the tires.  It may not be fast, but it is fun.<br><br>
