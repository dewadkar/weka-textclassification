              The new Chevy Impala is outstanding.  My parents bought this vehicle to be a family car and it has lived up to all of its expectations.  I am not going to get into all of the technical stuff about why this vehicle is great.  That will probably bore all of us.

  I fell in love with the sleek new look of the Chevy Impala.  The new look of the car brings a whole new flare to this vehicle.  The heated seats are also really nice to, I have back problems and these seats are fabulous for people with back problems like me.  This car also rides like it is floating on clouds, well not that smooth, but you get my point.

  The interior and trunk of the car is also very roomy.  Trust me, I am 6'4&quot; tall and this car gives me plenty of room to maneuver in.  This car also has a computerized message center, which I think is very helpful and amazing for this type of vehicle.  The Chevy Impala gives one a sophisticated and luxurious look without the luxury cost of some of today's cars.This car can be bought by the family or the single individual in today's working world, it's the best of both worlds. Thumbs up to this Chevy production.<br><br>
