            I really like the Toyota Tacoma but the marketing rate on these small trucks are getting outrageously high!They are very small trucks,i do own one myself because all i have ever owned was a Toyota.I buy them for the dependability.They last longer than any other vehicle that i have ever owned.   The down side to this story is they are costing customers almost more than a full size american truck,when they are only compact in size!I guess because they are so popular for their dependability some customers overlook price.If you are not worried about cost then by all means buy one they are great,but me personally i think i'm going to keep the 1994 truck that i have mainly due to the inflation in costs for purchasing one of these bad boys.<br><br>
