            I don't own this car, but my best friend does so I get to drive it a lot.

He purchased a 1998 Boxster with 7500 miles for $42k.  This car has the 201-hp engine in it (I don't believe the S, with 250 hp, was available in 1998, but I may be wrong about that).

<b>HANDLING</b>
The car handles beautifully.  I've driven a great many sports cars, but this car had the best feel, most accurate responses, and inspired the greatest confidence.  The car is forgiving and responsive even at the limit.  Body roll is (of course) minimal, with the car's perfect weight distribution, low center of gravity, and ideal suspension geometry.  The car truly feels like an extension of your body and seems to know instinctively what you expect of it.

I've also driven a Dodge Viper extensively (I love my friends).  The Viper, a much more massive and totally different sort of car, sticks to the road as well as the Boxster, but suffers from miserable camber steer, lack of precision, and an overall numb quality.  Stickiness and communication are not necessarily the same qualities, but the Boxster possesses both in spades.

<b>TRANSMISSION</b>
This car has Porsche's trigger-shifting Tiptronic manumatic 5-speed transmission.  This is the first (and only) manumatic tranny I've driven, and forgive me if I don't see the point.  All it is, is an enhanced slushbox, which as we all know reduces efficiency, fuel economy, and performance.  The Tiptronic costs too much money, and offers no benefits except, perhaps, for those who cannot drive a stick-shift and do not wish to learn.  This car is not terribly fast even with a stick-shift, and this slush box does a great job of slowing the car down even further.  Shifter response is slow (during acceleration, expect to wind the motor up an additional 700 RPM between command and execution).  Shifting with the wheel turned is a complicated and not especially safe process (better is Ferrari's fixed shifter paddles, or a floor-mounted mechanism).  What faint praise I can offer is that a manumatic 5-speed is better than a plain-vanilla automatic, except that it costs more.

<b>ERGONOMICS</b>
Flawless, but with two exceptions.  These seats are terrible if you're unfortunate to be over, say, 5'10&quot; tall.  I'm 6'1&quot; and the seats get much narrower as they rise, digging into my shoulder blades in an exquisitely uncomfortable manner.  For me, these seats would disqualify the car.  The second flaw is the radio, which doesn't sound particularly good and is, predictably, very difficult to use even at a standstill.  While the rest of the world has rediscovered round tuning and volume knobs, Porsche and most of the rest of the Germans languish in the mid-80's.  Storage space is surprisingly adequate.  The top raises and lowers with unexpected dispatch (i.e., it's fast).  The doors have nifty, quasi-hidden storage bins and and provide more storage space than most other 2-seaters.

<b>ENGINE</b>
The standard 201-hp engine is barely sufficient, especially with the Tiptronic (see above).  Porsche pegs this configuration at 7.4 seconds to 60 mph, which seems about right.  In other words, (this is a factually correct statement) the average new Buick can take this car.  Wheel spin is impossible even on wet pavement with the Tip, and the car seems to take forever to reach even 100 mph with the top down.  To put this in perspective, 7.4 seconds 0-60 is on par with what a similarly-configured 1985 4-speed Pontiac Fiero can do (if there are any left) with 135 hp.  Ouch.  Duking it out with Fieros, and possibly LOSING, is not my idea of fun in a $40,000+ car.  However, a manual transmission helps quite a bit, guiding the car to 60 mph in 6.9 seconds -- Ford Probe GT territory.

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
Buy the car if you can (if you're not too tall).  It is one of the most stunning shapes ever rendered, a breakthrough in terms of design (technical and aesthetic).  If you like attention, the car (especially in red) will gather more than you need.  If you like feeling truly connected to a car and its road, few cars can match the Boxster (the magnificent Miata comes close).  But my strong suggestion is that you learn how to drive a stick-shift, and get the Boxster S with 250 HP and a 6-speed stick (or a 5-speed stick and sports package if you must get the 201-hp Boxster).

<b>UPDATE: 12 JUNE 2000</b>
After spending a glorious week in my buddy's Boxster (in return for taking him to the airport), I'd like to refine some of my comments.  I prefer to open up this &quot;train of thought&quot; rather than simply change my prior comments so you can see how the car's character seems to evolve over time.

<b>1. TIPTRONIC TRANSMISSION</b>: Before I stated that I didn't see the point.  After living with it for a week, I'm getting used to it.  I'd still choose a 5-speed and save the 3300 bucks (plus get better performance and mileage), but if you must have an auto tranny this is one hell of a good auto.  Like the Sega Dreamcast, every time I put the car in standard auto mode, I keep saying to myself, &quot;...it's thinking!...&quot;  Plus, how many people do you know with a 5-speed AUTO?  Not many, because they're extremely rare.  One irritant is that it prefers to select 2nd gear even from a standstill, and if you floor it it takes a few moments before it drops back into 1st gear.  Also, in Tip mode, downshifts seem lethargic.

<b>2. SEATS</b>: Not as bad as I thought they were.  I still think they're too narrow at the top, but they turned out to be much more comfortable and supportive than I expected.

<b>3. RADIO</b>: The radio sucks, period.  I hate it.  The buttons are confusing and cryptic.  The CD changer suffers from glacial slowness and extreme sensitivity to even the tiniest CD surface scratches.  Even switching from CD mode to radio mode takes, say, 5 times as long as it does in a Honda Civic.  The CD changer takes longer to load a new CD than it takes to play the CD itself (that's only a slight exaggeration).  Sound quality sucks.  This is a miserable, crappy radio, perfectly in line with Porsche's long heritage of lousy audio systems.

<b>4. HANDLING</b>: Got a chance to push the car harder this time.  Handling is neutral with a modest tendency to understeer, a function of the car's perfect weight distribution and smaller front tires.  These traits are ideal.  (Keep in mind this car has the hugely expensive sports handling package; I've never driven a standard Boxster, unfortunately).

<b>5. HEY, LOOK AT ME EVERYBODY, I'M DRIVING A RED PORSCHE CONVERTIBLE</b>: This car gets you a lot of looks.  I am king stud driving this car.  But I'm still afraid of being ambushed by Fieros.  I raced my girlfriend last night, who was driving my Saab 9-3 S and isn't exactly an expert when it comes to rowing the gears.  She easily beat the Porsche to 60 mph.<br><br>
