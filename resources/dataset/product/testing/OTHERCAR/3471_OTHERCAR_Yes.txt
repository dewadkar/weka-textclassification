            After having a total nightmarish day of changing the fuel filter,which we thought would be an easy 20 minute job on my 96 caravan and turned out to be an all day job of changing the fuel filter, fuel pump etc., we decided to check out our local dealer as they were having a sale for the week.  
 I was'nt even in the market for a car,(we were looking to purchase an SUV) when I sat in the drivers seat of the Bonneville because it looked cool. I instantly fell in love with this car even though it was a bit out of my price range. The dealer gave me an offer for my (nightmare) Caravan that I couldn't pass up. 
 The dealership let us keep the car overnight to decide if we wanted to purchase the car or not, so I did much research into the reliability and durability of the 2000 Bonneville (didn't want to take any chances after repeated costly repairs on the van). Everything I found while researching the car were good. So we decided to buy it if at all possible.
 There isn't much of anything about the Bonneville that I can say I would change except the placement of the cruise control, which is a little hard to get access to and to set. There is more than enough room in the car and my husband is 6'2 and has plenty of leg room while in the drivers or passengers seats. It has ALOT of pick up and go from a dead stop and I love the soft growl of the engine when stepping on the gas lol. 
 So far the gas mileage has been great, about 23-24 mpg mixed driving. All options work perfectly, even the power sunroof which I've never had before on any of my previous autos. The stereo Rocks! The seats are extremely comfortable. 
 I always considered the older versions of Bonnevilles as "Grandma-Grandpa" type cars. With the 2000 model, I have to fight off my 17yr old daughter from taking it lol. Her friends all drool over it and I can't blame them, my husband and I liked the car as soon as we saw it and it has only gotten better since we bought it.
 I would DEFINATLY recommend the Bonneville to anyone of any age. And I just had to add the while reading reviews I read that rumor has it the Bonneville will be discontinued after the 2004 model year. In my opinion Pontiac better hang on to this winner for a bit longer, after reading reviews on the smaller SUV's they aren't going to be very popular for much longer. (just my opinion)
