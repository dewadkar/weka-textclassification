                 The 1990 Buick Century has proven to be a much better car than I expected or could have hoped.  I was given this car as a hand me down from my parents (my 3rd hand me down) and was dreading having to drive it.  Being a 19 year old at the time, the prospect of driving a 9 year old car that looks like a quote "old lady car" (that's what many others have said) was not an exciting prospect.  But once I got inside, my mind was changed.

     The best feature of this car is the get up and go.  The V6 engine gives a kick everytime you hit the gas pedal.  No struggling to get up to speed on the on ramp or getting through a yellow light.  The car is also really roomy and makes long trips bearable.  

     The car doesn't have the basic things in new cars such as air bags or CD players, but it's good enough.  The original sound system isn't too shabby and there are power locks and seats.  One annoying little feature is that you cannot pop the trunk from inside the car.  You have to use a key to open it, so that can be a bother.  

     As for the current condition of the car, it's not looking so great anymore.  The medium blue paint has faded to very pale blue and there are rust spots everywhere.  This car as never been babied though.  It has sat outside for probably 7 years and driven daily.  The mileage is still only 69,000 and huge overhauls have not been needed.  The alignment has caused problems in the past.  The car also shakes because it's so light when you hit about 70 mph, but I guess I've gotten used to it.  Other than that it's not been too bad.  After driving it for about 3 years I'm ready for something from this century, but the 1990 Buick Century has done me right.
