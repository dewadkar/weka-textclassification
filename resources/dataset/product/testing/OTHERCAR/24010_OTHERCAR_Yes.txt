            I purchased my 1992 Accord EX 2 years ago for $9000 and I still love the car. When I bought it, the car only had 69000 miles, and now it has 110,000 miles.  It handles great, has a powerful engine, and a great ride with no rattles. The only problem I've had was the radiator wearing out (I suspect from the 100 degree Texas heat) When my friends get in and ride with me, they can't believe the car is 8 years old, because it really does look brand new!  This is why there are 3 Accords in my family...I have the 1992 Accord EX, my sister has a 1997 Accord SE, and my mom has a 2000 Accord EX V6.  We all are very happy with them...and not one of us has ever had a major problem with any of the cars. <br><br>
