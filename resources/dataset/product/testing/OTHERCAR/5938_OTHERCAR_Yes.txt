                 The 1994 Mitsubishi Mirage S Coupe the first car I have ever bought. In fact I bought it a few days ago. The bright red paint and $3500 price tag instantly caught my eye. After i test drove it i found it to toodle around with ease, and romp around corners at high rates of speed without so much as a skiff. So i traded in my trusty (but grotesque) 1979 Nova, talked them down to $3000, and signed on the dotted line. 
     My Mirage had 66,000 miles on it when i picked it up from the used car lot. The car looks good, minus a high occourance of paint chips and the lack of color matched bumpers. Despite what others say, with a stickshift and a heavy foot you will beat Hondas off the line with ease. I've put 300 miles on this car in the last 2 days, from the backroads to downtown seattle, it hasn't skipped a beat. The positive feeling 5 speed is suprisingly wide for a car of this class. I catch myself slipping to 90 on the freeway all too easy. Overall this car is a kick to drive. After I let a couple of my friends drive it (at different times) both commented that it was like a big go-kart, and I would agree, but so far im nothing but happy.
     I doubt I would go and buy a brand new Mirage when this one peters out, but for a kid just getting out of high school, it is a fun, good looking, dependable, efficent little ride.
