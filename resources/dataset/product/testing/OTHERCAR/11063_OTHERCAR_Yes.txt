            We read alot about the money spent on design and development of this vehicle.  We purchased 2....one ordered from factory.  The 5 speed performed flawlessly, was zippy and excellent on MPG.  At 98K, a misdiagnosis nearly cost us a fortune.  We changed timing belt and put new ignition wire harness and new plugs and all OK at 102K.  Excedllent commuter car.  The other '95, an AT, driven by daughter, had 55K with no problems mechanically.  Met it's demise Memorial Day '00 in collision.Cheap maintenance with best oils &amp; filters used.  Only gripes we had were the cheap, plastic dash louvres for AC/heat venting. Very easy to break, come loose, etc. with avg. usage.  Both women liked them the past 5 1/2 years and 5-spd OK at 102K.  Oh!  Oh!  The AC just went warm on us today.  F.Baker, Jacksonville, FL
