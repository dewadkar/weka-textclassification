            When Mazda redesigned the 626 back in '93 and a six became available for the first time I wanted one. I can't exactly say why, but something about that car really appealed to me. It just seemed "right," with clean, precise styling in and out, a suspension tuned for handling, and a five speed available with a DOHC six. It had something extra about it lacking in an Accord or Camry. "Zoom zoom," perhaps?

I never did buy one. When I did go shopping for a sedan, in 1997, I ended up with a Ford Contour SE. I didn't expect to, but I test drove one, and have never regretted that choice. Why didn't I take this chance to buy the Mazda? Well, the Ford depreciated a lot more in that first year, making it fit my budget much better. It was also much easier, being in the Detroit area, to find a Contour with my preferred powertrain, a six with a manual.

That I really like my Contour might give you a clue that my tastes differ from those of the general buying public. The Contour is no longer sold here largely because it was lacking in rear seat room compared to an Accord or Camry, and the much roomier Taurus was available in the same showroom for just a bit more money. Mazda had a similar problem with that 626 I liked. It was a half-size smaller than the Camry, and nearly as much money, so it did not sell well. I never did drive one, but from what I've read the ride was a bit firm for American tastes as well.

Mazda set out to fix these "problems" when they redesigned the 626 for 1998. The new 626 was larger and softer. The new car was also a bit more distinctively styled, with a number of cues borrowed from the more expensive Millenia. I actually preferred the cleaner styling of the old car, but its appeal was more subtle, involving great proportions, clean lines, and thoughtful details. Subtle doesn't sell here. I'm not sure it sells anywhere. So I suspect the new styling represents a large improvement for most people.

I recently rented a 2001 626 for three days. It was not optioned the way I would want one, but that's a rental for you. The car I drove was the base model with cloth, a four cylinder, and an automatic. The 626 I once wanted differed in all three of these areas, but that's the breaks. So, to be fair, there are 626s out there that would appeal to me more than the one I am reviewing here.

But none of them appeal to me like the older car did. I liked the old car because it was doing its own thing. The new car is trying to be another Camry. Frankly, the real Camry is a better Camry. Both of its engines are more powerful, and the car is overall significantly smoother and quieter. The new 626 is 2/3 of the way there, but has enough of the old car still in it that it no longer appeals to its old audience but will still have trouble appealing to Toyota buyers.

What do I mean by this? Since 1992 Toyota has applied many of the lessons it learned from developing the big Lexus to the Camry. The result is a car that is much quieter and smoother than any mid-sized family car before. Since then the competition has reacted by closing the gap, but the Camry still leads in these areas. So while the 626 rides fairly well, it's not quite as composed as a Camry. Similarly, while the 626 even at highway speeds is far from loud, it is noticeably louder than the Camry. Road noise on some surfaces is especially prominent.

The real dream killer for me is that the improved ride came at a hefty price. The new 626 is a fairly squishy handler. Nothing unsafe, mind you. But it's never any fun. Push it hard into a turn, and it rolls considerably, and generally communicates that this is not how it wants to be driven. While the old car (in my mind at least, but I believe also in reality) had a tightness to its handling, the current car is flabby. The Camry is no star in this area either. But then I don't want a Camry, either.

My comments on the powertrain are predictable, but I'll say a few words anyway. The four is just adequate for moving this car. When pushed, it makes a lot of unthrilling buzzes. Kind of like the suspension, it does its best to communicate that THIS IS A FAMILY CAR, so "no pushing, please." The six with a five speed would appeal to me more, but unless the suspension tuning is dramatically different the driving spirit is not in this car, zoom zoom ads aside. I should also mention that the four and the six in the Camry, especially the six, have significantly more oomph. As does the Accord's six, and the Galant's six... On the plus side, Mazda charges only $1,200 more for its six, while Toyota charges about $2,200 more for its (after adjusting for equipment). So if you want a six, the 626 may be the value buy among Japanese family sedans.

The interior of the 626 I drove was a thoroughly forgettable place. This is both good and bad, since nothing was so great or so bad that it stuck deeply in my mind. Room front and rear is typical for this class of car, comfort is so-so (I'd like to have firmer cushions), and the styling is not special in any way, unlike past Mazdas. Driving position is typical for a Japanese sedan, which means visibility is good in all directions. Unlike many American and European sedans, even shorter drivers' sightlines are well above the dash and beltline. The old 626 was even better in this area, though. The interior materials are also a bit cheaper than they used to be, with lots of hard plastic.

The trunk had plenty of room for my double stroller and three pieces of luggage. The lid did have a nasty tendency to bounce back down right after I opened it, though. For more cargo space, the rear seatback folds forward in two pieces. The opening this creates is fairly small, though.

To sum up, the current 626 is a bland, thoroughly middle of the road family sedan. If all you want is a reliable car that does nothing bad, and Madza is offering a price that looks good to you, then this is an OK car. If you're looking for "zoom zoom," though, you'd better look at another Mazda. The Protege one step down and the Millenia one step up are both more exciting cars to drive (I'll be reviewing a Millenia soon). 

If this is the price class you're interested in, though, all is not lost. Mazda has tended to redesign the 626 every five years, so a new one should show up in another 18 months or so. Given Mazda's renewed emphasis on driving verve, there's a good chance the next 626 will have that special something like the previous one did. I certainly hope so. 

While they're at it, a proper name might be nice. When Mazda also sold a 323 and a 929, "626" made a little sense. But now that it's the only car in the line with a number for a name, it's just a bit weird. Not to mention boring. If Nissan still called the Maxima an 810, would it have the passionate following it has? So hopefully the next 626 regains the car's former spirit, and gets a name to match.
