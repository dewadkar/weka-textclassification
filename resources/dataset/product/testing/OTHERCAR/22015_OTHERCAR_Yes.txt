            I have owned my 1997 Dodge Caravan for almost 3 years.  It is a base model with the 3.3L V6 motor. Sure,sure, it's a little bland and some of my friends laugh at me and call it the "dustbuster-mobile." But hey, I love my Caravan, baby, and I recommend it to anyone looking for a versatile, comfy, solid-handling vehicle! hehe   Ok, back to the serious review..  
 The only repairs that I have had to perform during my ownership thus far have been outer tie rod replacement ($110), a solder replacement on the dashboard circuitry ($60 repair), and front rotor and pad replacement ($90 parts, replaced easily myself) It has been very reliable for me.
 I have read the other reviews and fortunately have not experienced the radical problems that some of the other reviewers have cited in their documents.  I would be curious as to what engine they have in their vans, as I have heard that Dodge had problems with the 4 cylinder and 3.0L V6 model, which is why I looked specifically for a 3.3L V6 model--this engine has a history of better reliability in contrast to the lower displacement engines offered by Dodge, so look for the 3.3 or the 3.8 when you look at purchasing a Caravan!  
I am especially happy with the function and versatility of my Caravan. The inside is laid out efficiently and makes the most of it's interior space. Also, the interior ergonomics are splendid on the Caravan-- specifically, the easy to reach controls, excellent adjustable cup-holders (you will love them!!) radio, and steering and transmission levers. It is a well designed interior that lends itself to a very comfortable feeling for the driver. I can honestly say that it is the most well-laid out interior of any car that I have owned. Granted, I have never owned a 'Benz or a Bimmer for comparison, but I think I would still be impressed with my little Van even if I did  :-)
 I have been very pleased with the solid, road-worthy feel of the Caravan, as well. My Caravan (nicknamed Blimey) has the road feel of a car, which is especially nice on long drives or just frequent use where comfort is a wonderful attribute! I use my Caravan for business and personal, logging at least 500 miles per week and I am never uncomfortable.
In contrast, I test drove the 1997 Ford Windstar minivan, and found that it handled and felt much like a truck, which immediately eliminated it during my vehicle selection process. After all, I was looking for a van, not a bloody pickup truck, mate!
Without further droning on, I will simply say that I love my Caravan and will keep it as long as it stays as reliable as it has been! 
Good luck in your van search, and definitely test drive a Dodge Caravan, you will probably be very impressed :-)
Take care, and happy shopping!

10/28/02 UPDATE:  Minor repairs/maintenance but still happy
Still extremely happy with my Van.  Now have 116,000 miles on it and still only minor repairs- right tie rod and minor air conditioning repair (1 seal and recharge).  Test drove a 2003 Dodge Grand Caravan for a day and concluded that I like the previous generation van (mine) better. Why?  The visibility in the new Caravan seems diminished in comparison to that of the previous version. Also, cabin space in the drivers area has been compressed due to redesigned interior (In my van I like resting my left leg along side the drivers seat, but found I couldn't do this in the new caravan because the door console is too big and there was no room to do this little leg rest maneuver!)
Also, the controls in my 1997 van seem a bit easier to reach and use than the 2003.  
The interior noise level in the 2003 Grand Caravan was definitely lower than my van, but not worth trading for the coveted visibility afforded in my '97 model. 
I was kind of bummed because my plan was to purchase one of the "next" generation (2001 or newer) Caravans when it was time to retire my '97, but I really don't like the latest generation after test driving for a day. When the time comes to retire my beloved little van, I think I will try to find one of the "older" models (98-99) with low miles, or just look at something else.  :-(
Hate to do it, but I bought the van for features that seem, to me, to be missing in the latest variant of Caravan.

5/13/03 UPDATE- TRANSMISSION SOLUTION, READ THIS!!!
132,000 miles and still rolling.. Have some interesting points that may be of help to the Caravan owner/buyer:  After experiencing the proverbial transmission slippage earlier this winter I took the van in to have the tranny fluid/filter replaced.. Two weeks later the problem resurfaced!   I took the van back to my favorite (and truly trusted) Dodge Dealership and explained the issue.. Turns out that the van had an axle seal that was worn and leaking transmission fluid, hence the slippage.  Seal was replaced over two months ago and the transmission has been running good since then!   So, my experience can be of value to the other Caravan owners (and potential owners)-- Have your axle seals checked above 100k miles, and IF your transmission starts slipping, have a reliable (trustworthy) shop check the seals before someone talks you into an unnecessary transmission replacement!!!  Cost of seal replacement $110.   Cost of new transmission $1000+!!!
Otherwise the van is still running good and I enjoy the carlike ride and versatility as much as I did when I bought it  :-)
