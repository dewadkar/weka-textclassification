            I've owned my 2001 Hyundai Tiburon for a year and I have no regrets in making my choice.

My first choice for a car was the 2001 Toyota Celica because I was into it's stylish look. The price was a little out my range though. I did a search for sports cars under $20K and the Hyundai Tiburon came up. I saw the way it looked and fell in love with it. It looks so sleek and came at a very reasonable price of $15K. I decided to give it a test drive later that week.

During the test drive, I was very amused by the way that the panels were set up. Everything looked so futuristic. I felt like I was in a spaceship of some sort. The seats were very comfortable. I preferred cloth over leather. The speakers sounded very nice with my CD playing (especially since my previous car had only one speaker working). It was hard for me to use the mirrors because they were smaller than the car I had previously owned. You could hear a little road noise from the outside but I expected it since it was such a small car. I also felt kinda cramped in the front. It took awhile to adjust to.

I'm not one to care too much about performance of a car. As long as it's stylish and doesn't break down, I'm pretty much happy with it.

After a year (and I'm at 30K miles), I've had no maintenance problems with the car except the fact that my auto locks don't work anymore. I could always get it fixed for free with the warranty, but it's not really much of an inconvenience since it's a 2-door vehicle. As long as you have regular checks, oil changes, rotation & balances, the simple regular maintenance to have done on any car... you should be fine.

I plan to have this car for as long as it'll drive. :)
