            The Epson PhotoPC750z is one of the best midrange cameras I have found.  Unfortunately, Epson apparently is not investing much in marketing of this little wonder, because it may be difficult to find in certain areas.

The 750Z is a 1280 x 960 pixel, 24 bit color camera that uses a 1.25 megapixel CCD sensor. It carries an &quot;on-board&quot; zoom of 3x true optical and a 4MB internal flash memory.  It comes with an 8MB flash card that combined with the &quot;on-board&quot; memory, can hold approximately 54 fine or 178 standard resolution images.  In addition, Epson packages 4 NiMH batteries and a charger which, along with the included RS-232 download cable, feet neatly and compactly in the included carrying case.

I have used this camera for varied applications from personal to business.  The camera has been a life saver in creating media images for various computer based training modules, presentations, and other applications.  In addition, the prints produced by this and an Epson photo printer (i.e., the Epson 700 photo for example) are remarkable.  Prints that are 8 x 10 may show some degrees of pixelation, but 5 x 7's and smaller can pass for &quot;almost&quot; real photographs.

One feature I find incredibly innovative is the outdoor view screen booster.  At the users discretion, a switch can be used to move a mirror into place that reflects the suns light to boost the output of the LCD for viewing in direct light.  In addition, the Sierra Imaging program that is included, makes downloading images extremely simple with the click of a mouse.
