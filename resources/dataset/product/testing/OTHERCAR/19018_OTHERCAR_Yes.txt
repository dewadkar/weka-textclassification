            I was going to Miami and did not want to take my own car, so I rented and put the miles on someone else's 'ride.'  Initially I was quite disappointed to find that I would be driving a Dodge Neon; this car would be my companion for thousands of miles and the Neon concept did not exactly excite me.  At least the car was fresh from the assembly line, as rentals often are. 
But what I expected of and what I received from the Neon are completely different things.
I had foreseen a visibly cheap, weak and ugly car.
The Neon, however, surprised me greatly.  The new model is nice looking.  I hate to say this, but I think it looks cool.  (my particular rent-a-neon had a great blueish-gray color)  It also provided more power than I had expected.  It is fully capable of merging onto highways and passing big-rigs.  It is quiet and smooth at the posted speed limit of 70 miles per hours. (Note: MPH limit quoted found on many Georgia and Florida interstates.  MPH may vary state to state, see local interstate for further details)  And the gas mileage was so good!  I hardly spent any money; it was even better mileage than the Ford Focus that I am currently stuck with (see earlier review; I am normally not so nice to small cars :> ).  
The Neon does not have a compact feel to it, especially on the inside.  It feels like a normal size car!  Amazing.
I looked further into the Neon, and with the features that my car had and that I enjoyed, this 'little guy' would cost less than $14k.  While that is a lot of money, it is certainly inexpensive as far as a car goes.  I now want to lose the sour tasting 'lemon' of a Ford Focus that I have and purchase myself a blue-gray Neon.  
It may not be the coolest car on earth, but it got me from point A to point B very well.
