            I bought my 1994 Saturn SL2, my first &quot;new&quot; car, because I had heard how reliable they are.  I hope they have improved on their definition of reliable by now.  I liked many of the features of this car: it handles very well, and the anti-lock brakes were great, the lumbar support was great for long trips, and it got nearly 33 miles to the gallon. I hated to trade it in, but I just didn't trust it anymore.  At 22,000 miles, the ignition chip went out.  At 34,000 miles, the stereo quit working.  At 45,000 miles, I had to have repairs on the transmission.  It would not go in to first gear correctly.  At 65,000 miles, the altenator went out.  At 85,000 the cruise control quit.  All of these were repairs made under warranty.  After 5 years, the warranty ran out, and the cruise, transmission and stereo were all having problems again. The cruise died again less than 3 days after the repair warranty ran out. By this time, I had right at 100,000 miles on it.  I guess it is just easier to finance another one than it is to make repairs on an old one, so I traded.  If this is their reliability, I'd hate to see a lemon.  This car would be good for someone who doesn't travel a lot, and who doesn't mind paying the extra for the extended warranty.  I'm sure glad that I did.
