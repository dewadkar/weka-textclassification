            I have driven my 1984 Maxima just over 172,000 miles in the 17 years I have owned it. It has been an exceptional car which even today gets the same MPG it did when new - between 23-24 tank-to-tank in generally local driving. It does not burn any oil between changes at 3,000 to 4,000 miles with Mobil 1 oil. Maintenance has been generally routine with no major failures; although the rear shocks are now showing signs of wear. I've gone through tires, batteries, various filters, spark plugs and some brake cable rubber seals. Also the water pump was replaced at 80,000 and I needed a new ignition module at around 100,000.The interior has held up beautifully - no rips, tears or unsightly wear spots. It looks fine. All the power options (windows, etc.) work well, including the air conditioning. The auto transmission is perfect. All in all, this has been an exceptional automobile. I have cared for it as required and in return in has delivered the goods.
