            Why do I detest the Chevy Cavalier? Ever since I bought my 1993 Cavalier, I have had nothing but trouble with it, from warped brake pads, to leaking hoses. Not to mention trouble with the power steering, the built-in CD player, and the heat. I have spent an enormous amount of money fixing up my car, and I can't imagine the newer Cavaliers being built any better. 
Of course, the seats are comfortable, and the bass level is decent. The built in CD player is wonderful when it decides to work correctly. Overall, though, I would have to say &quot;pass&quot; on this car.<br><br>
