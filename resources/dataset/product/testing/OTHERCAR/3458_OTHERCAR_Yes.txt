            When looking for a new auto recently, I considered the BMW 323ci,
the Mercedes C230 Kompressor, and the Audi A4 Quattro.  Why did
I pick the 2001 Acura 3.2CL Type-S?  Lots of reasons!  For under
US$30,000, I got a car with quite a lot of power (260 Hp), lots
of comfort and convenience features -- the six-way power seats with
two memory positions are wonderful, the Acura reputation for
reliability, and a really cool color: &quot;Sundance Gold&quot;, a metallic
orange paint.  And this car is one of the least expensive models
that come standard with Xenon high-intensity discharge headlights.

After spending a lot of time in this car both in the city and
on the highway, I find that its strong points are comfort on
the highway, comfortable seats, strong torque at low RPMs, and
a fabulous 6-disc in-dash changer.  The weak points include too
much body flex going over bumps, the lack of an available manual
transmission, and a look that is too similar to the Toyota Solara.

This car is a good choice for someone in the market for a luxury
sports coupe.  It's reliable, fast, fun, and has a very nice 
stereo.  Drivers interested in a sports suspension and better
road feedback should consider the BMW 323Ci or 330Ci as well.
