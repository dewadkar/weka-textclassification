            Just took delivery of a 2000 Silverado SB SW LS. LS 
offers numerous standard features. Did opt for a V-8
and Locking rear axle, Wheel rim upgrade and dimming mirror.
Very easy to drive in town per steering and 
maneuvering. But short wheelbase give a bouncy ride
if not on smooth road. Standard Radio/CD is much
better than expected. V-8 very responsive and 
smooth, still too early for mileage comment.
Auto lamps and radio shut off take some getting
use too but a nice feature.

updating my ride comment - called dealer about
bouncy ride. Turns out with only 2,000 miles
tires are out-of-round. So Goodyear is
replacing all four. See what happens
