            I did a lot of research before deciding on the particular camera.  I was thinking about Kodak and HP, but neither had a camera as small as this one.  It fits easily in a pocket or purse.

Features:  1.6 LCD screen (decent size), 3x optical zoom(this is important, as using the digital zoom makes pictures less clear if enlarged), uses Compact Flash media card (less expensive than other types), has 2.0 mp memory,
14 Scene modes,such as beach/snow, portrait, night landscape, party, fireworks, museum(no flash), etc.  It can also take 15 second video clips, although they are not high quality.  You can use rechargeable batteries in this camera.


I have found that using this camera is quite easy, even for digital amateurs like myself.  Instructions are very clear and easy to comprehend.  It includes a USB cable, so to view your pictures, just connect your camera to your computer, the software automatically starts, and with one touch, voila! Your pictures!  

The one con:  I have read about this as a con in many digital cameras.  If you are taking candid shots, you may not always get the exact shot that you want, because the camera takes time to focus.  If it is not focused, it will not take the shot.  You have to push the shutter button down halfway, let it focus, and then press it fully.  Of course, the beauty of digital cameras is that you can preview the shot in case you need to take another.

I have printed out some pictures, and the color is beautiful and true to life.  Make sure you are using the right mode, though.  I took some nighttime pictures using the night mode, and they all had streaks of lights across them. When I used the regular flash mode, they came out very well.  You have to play around with it a little to get comfortable using some of the advanced features.

I really love this camera. People are always impressed with how small it is, and how nice the pictures are.
