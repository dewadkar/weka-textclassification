            I've been bugging my husband for a minivan for a year or so now, and since we got our tax return and paid off our Dodge Neon, we decided to shop around and see what we could afford.  Well, it only took one visit to a local Five Star Chrysler dealer to find our van.  We had researched them all on the web, made up our minds about what one we wanted to look at, then off we went.  The salesman was extremely friendly, not pushy, which is what I despise.  He took some general info, then showed us 2 Voyagers on the lot meeting our needs.  Both were the same, one was silver, the other blue.  We test drove the silver one, and were amazed at how quiet it was.  Very comfortable, easy to handle, and enough space for our 3 kids and the 2 booster seats now required by NJ law.  We don't have a fully loaded model, it's nothing fancy, but we've got enough to suit us...power window and door locks, dual sliding doors, am/fm w/cd player (my hubby is thrilled w/this), the two rear bench seats are interchangeable, there's a spare tire, jack, and ample room for groceries, small furniture, and anything else you might need.  The interior lights come on and stay on after you get in the van so you can find your keyhole to start the car, there are two front airbags, just so many little things that our older cars didn't have, I'm tending to ramble on.  Financing was easy, too.  They worked to get us at a monthly payment we were comfortable with.  I can't say enough about this car...we went from a '95 Neon and a '92 Chevy Lumina to this Voyager, and I'm thrilled with the purchase.  If you're like us and on a budget, this van is for you. There are higher priced models of it for those of you can go for it, but if you just need the basics, this is truly a great car for the money.
