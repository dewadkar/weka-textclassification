            This is a great car. The ride isn't the best due to the fact that it is a SUV. Because all SUV's are made for the off-road. The 1999 Suburban is available in either Base, LS or LT trim. All three trim levels are available on the four different models offered. The top of the line LT trim offers standard leather interior and is available with an optional Comfort and Security Package that includes heated front seats. Standard depowered airbags are new for 1999, as well as three new exterior colors: Gold, Meadow Green and Medium Charcoal Gray. The OnStar communication system is an available dealer installed option. Suburban 4WD models are available with an optional �on-demand� 4WD system called AutoTrac. AutoTrac engages 4WD when extra traction is needed, and when the additional traction is no longer needed the system reverts back to 2WD. The car is great and i recomend it to anyone who likes it.<br><br>
