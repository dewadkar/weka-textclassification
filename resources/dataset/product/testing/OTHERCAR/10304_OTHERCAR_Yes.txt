            I've been an Altima owner for nearly five years now.  (Obviously, then, I'm talking about the older body style here.)  And the car still runs as well today as it did on day one.  That in itself is impressive.  So far my Altima, aside from the usual standard maintenance, has needed its rear struts replaced, twenty thousand miles after they were supposed to fail.  Aside from that everything is original.  The car currently has 126,500 miles.  The voltage regulator on the radio is starting to go, making the sound get either too &quot;hot&quot; or too soft and faint sometimes, but it's intermittent and so far I haven't felt compelled to get it fixed.

The car rides well.  It can be a little ponderous in tight turns, but it's not a major problem.  (Not a BMW, in other words, but not a minivan either.)  Cabin tends to the quiet side for such a low-priced car, especially when the standard-issue Goodyear Eagle tires are used.  Engine is surprisingly powerful for a 4-cylinder...better than either a Taurus six or a Camry four (and about as good or maybe slightly better than a Camry six).  Ergonomics are excellent, with a few glaring exceptions: the cupholders are a joke, and the top of a large soda in a paper cup is perilously close to the cassette deck...one large bump or ride downhill and your soda can spill into the deck's innards.  The glovebox is *ridiculously* small and almost useless--CHECK THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT BEFORE YOU BUY.  This single feature is so extreme it along could understandably dissuade some from buying the car.  There's also a lack of inside storage: the console between the seats is fine, but the map pockets on the door are smallish, there are no backseat pockets, and no overhead or in-dash storage.  Well, there is one in-dash space, but it can hold maybe two audio cassettes, and it doesn't close, so in rapid acceleration those cassettes could end up on the floor.

But those are the minuses.  Now the plusses: easy-to-read instruments and gauges.  (One professional reviewer called them &quot;confusing.&quot;  I wonder what he could be talking about.  They are the cleanest I've ever seen outside the Lexus LS400.)  The buttons on the dash are well-placed and all feel different, so you don't have to take your eyes off the road a lot to find something.  Trunk is large for a car this size (no full-size spare, unfortunately).  There's no fold-down rear set (though there's an entrance into the back through the rear armrest for long objects like skis), and while this doesn't bother me, it might annoy some people who want to haul big items.  

There are lots of little amenities usually only found in more expensive cars: the flip-down latch that covers the trunk keyhole, the standard power window and doors (on the GXE), the power antenna, the elegant metal door handles on the inside, the lighted vanity mirror on the passenger visor, the lack of an overall tacky monochrome plastic look that many comparable American cars have.  Under the hood, key items are easy to locate, reach, and check on, and it's very easy to figure out what's what and what the fluid level is, even for a non-mechanical person like me!

Styling is a subjective criterion, but I'll point out that if you look at the original Altima, which debuted in 1993, and all the other cars at that time, you realize how far ahead of the game Nissan was.  The new version hasn't impressed me as much with its styling, but again, this sort of thing is very subjective.

One thing to be wary of that no one else has mentioned: the paint is delicate and the finish probably isn't up to the level of an Accord or Camry, not to mention a BMW, with which the Altima compares itself.  A lot of polishing helps,but casual brushes...opening the door and lightly touching a wall with the door's edge...causing paint to chip away rather easily.  Buy a small bottle of touchup paint when you buy this car for just such brushes.

To sum up, if you want an attractive, elegant-yet-sporty small-to-midsize car that needs little fussing beyond routine maintenance, check this model out.  But be aware of the small glovebox, the inferior paint, and the sorry cupholders.  Also, if you want a big car, if you have two kids and you all like to eat and drink while you take long drives on weekends, this is not for you.  But then again, what sporty semi-compact car is?  Overall, though, it compares well to the somewhat-overhyped Accord, in my opinion, and may even be of interest to Camry buyers (though they'd probably want to go for a Maxima).<br><br>
