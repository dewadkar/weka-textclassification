            My son and niece was in an accident this year in which it was said that the Blazer flipped at least three times.The boy escaped with a sore back and an aching neck in which he did therapy for a few weeks. Now even though he is not completely the young boy he once was he is alive and really living good. He's afraid to play football but I think within a few months that fear will leave.My niece had a sore hand which got well within two weeks. It may be due to the fact that they had their seatbelts on but the kids were more sore than anything. The boy back we are assured will get back to normal.The woman in the ambulance said that earlier she came from another rollover that ended with death so I will always cherish the Blazer and it will forever be my vehicle of choice.<br><br>
