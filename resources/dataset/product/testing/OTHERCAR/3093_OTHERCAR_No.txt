            Consider this: A beautiful car with a suspension that floats like Ivory soap and the interior is classic Lincoln styling with all the amenities. Everything appears perfect and it rides like a limo, when suddenly the rear air bag suspension fails. It's still operable for awhile, then the front suspension fails as well. If you purchase this car at auction, you may have bought something more than a luxury car. You may discover that the suspension problem is something that you didn't quite plan for.
 I'm a passenger in this luxury car and have enjoyed the adjustable leather seats that move vertically and horizontally by use of a simple switch on the door (very handy for my shorter height).The air-inflated lumbar support button combined with the adjustable seats assures a perfectly cozy fit. The bronze-tinted moonroof is a joy in summer weather for viewing constellations while parked at the beach, or while riding. Overall, this Lincoln has proved to be impressive. The sleek and distinctive classic comfort is very welcomed by this passenger, but I would encourage all prospective buyers to have a complete and thorough check done by a qualified mechanic before you choose this model. Lincolns are desired by many and afforded by few. The cost for repairs may be more than the initial purchase price. Shop carefully, and you'll do well. It's still worth a look!<br><br>
