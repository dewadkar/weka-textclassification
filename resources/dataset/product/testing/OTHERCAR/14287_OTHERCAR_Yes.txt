             I just recently bought a 2001 Chevy Suburban 1500 LT. I got it because we needed the space for cargo and passengers, our old 1993 dodge Caravan just wasn't cutting it. 

<b> Interior Design and Elements: </b>

  The 2000-20001 Chevrolet Suburbans are available with great interior leather colors. Black/Gray and Tan. The dashboard is very big and overtaking. The driver's seat is very comfortably positioned and the contros are accesable. The tape deck was stuck somewhere between the dash and the cupolders. There are three 12v outlets below the dash. The stock radio/CD/Tape player <b>is sweet!</b>. The storage bin is very handy in storing your change, papers, pens, and garbage. The two overhead reading lamps are great and so is the ONSTAR system. The AC/Heat works great too. The front two captain seats are very comfortable and have adjustable lumbar support and recline, and they have two levels of heated seats(Hi/Low). The rear two captain seats are comforatable and thee is plenty ofleg room. the only downside is is that that when you get out you have about 4 inches of room to swing your feet out of the door. The rear bench seats have absolutely no leg room, but the seat is pretty comfortable. On the side the bins dont hae any covers, and it looks very bad and you can't rest your arms. The trunk has enough room to haul all or your luggage, about 42sq.ft. 

<b> Exterior Design and Elements: </b>

The exterioir design is awesome. How could you go wrong. The graceful curves still contrast with the masculine elements, to provide a car that s meant fdor men and women.

<b> Engine/ Suspension/ Handling: </b>

 The V8 engine in the 1500 LT comes with enough power for your average hauling needs. Now lets talk about the part of this car i hate the most. The suspension. You can feel every single rock, crack, bump, dip and hole on the road. The Suburban handles average for an SUV, nothing to special. And gas mileage well you figure it ou:t 35gallon gas tank average of about 15-16mpg.We spend about $30-40 at the pump filling it up all the way, depending on gas prices. Buying gas is gonna leave a big hole in your pocket $$$.

*Update - The car spends quite a bit of time in the shop for some malfunctions, such as broken seatbelt and malfunctioning power windows
