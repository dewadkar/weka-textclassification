            My chance to test and evaluate the 2001 Chrysler Sebring Convertible came in the early part of this year.  I had logged on about 3500 miles in a very short month of heavy driving prior to writing this epinion.  This car really is a middle-aged man�s delight, to say the least.

Go ahead, stretch your legs, laugh, raise your hands and thoroughly enjoy the ride.  This iteration of the 2001 Chrysler Sebring Convertible is the first total major redesign since it was introduced in 1996.  For the 2001 model year the Sebring Convertible builds on an unprecedented combination of design, and new features.

It should be noted that the 2001 Chrysler Sebring Convertible has new added power over its previous model since it offers an all new, all aluminum, 2.7l DOHC 24V SMPI V6, which pumps out 200hp to the front wheels.

The new power plant has a very easily noticeable increase in the mid range torque as compared to the older power plant.  This increase can be attributed to the active intake manifold-tuning valve.

The 2001 Chrysler Sebring Convertible can be had in three rim levels, the LX, Lxi, and Limited.  All models can be had with the ever so popular AutoStick transaxle that provides the control of a manual, with the relative fun and ease of an automatic transmission.  This particular tranny really is a fun toy to play with.  The shifts are always smooth and controlled.

However, I must admit the interest I had in it had slowed the longer I spent in the car.  I guess it really is fun to use now and then, say for a late night jaunt in the country side, on a weekend.  (Again, catering to the male mid-life demographic)

The 2001 Chrysler Sebring Convertible displays an extensive array of safety features, which is always very important nowadays for today�s safety conscious crowd.  Every market research group I have had the unfortunate task to sit in, suggest that safety is at the top in terms of importance for the consumer.

The Sebring features an improved side impact protection with additional front door beams.  (Nice.)  The car also features an improved safety cage with integrated seat belts.  Also included in this new rendition are a new multi-stage front air bags, higher head restraints, internal trunk release, and the always standard seat belt pretensioners.  

To further highlight the 2001 Chrysler Sebring Convertible�s safety design, the vehicle now comes with a new larger/beefier four wheel disc brake system which is now standard on all models.  These brakes are controlled by a new software program that help control and initiate the entire system in violent turning situations.

This is a welcome sign that manufacturers care, and want all of their customers to be safe.  (Honestly though it probably saves the maker CASH in terms of manufacturing tooling and the reduction in the number of different parts across the entire model line.)

Now in terms of the actual convertible top, it features a full cloth headliner that provides both sound and climate protection.

Overall, the 2001 Sebring Convertible puts Chrysler in the top of a very rare automotive segment.  The car vastly improves on an already sophisticated car which has been North America�s best selling convertible.

In my short time with this vehicle it has impressed me thoroughly on it�s safety features and it�s vast array of features designed to cater to the driver.  It will not surprise me if Chrysler lead this niche segment for the next few years as this car really is something special.

I do not even think the new iteration of the popular Ford Thunderbird will realistically affect sales.  The T-Bird is a whole different car.  (2 seater, less room, limited availability = more expensive)
