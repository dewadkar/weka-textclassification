            When I was looking for a camera last year, I chose this silver/Grey Cybershot DSC-S50 by Sony. It was great! I loved the programmed auto and manual (aperture priorty f2.8 - f/11, or shutter priority 8s - 1/725s) modes. It focuses very close, within 3 inches, and closer if you don't mind a little image manipulation afterward. 


-- What I use it for --

Primarily for night-time/pre-dawn landscapes, some interior architectural shots, web publishing (great for detailed figurines 3" or larger, or smaller with close-up rings), and experimenting. I've used the MPEG feature once, didn't like it.


-- Disappointments --

I'm very comfortable with the controls and can navigate the onscreen menus reliably, if slowly (due to the cursor pad). One disappointment is that it uses Sony Memory Stick technology. Hardly surprising being that it's a Sony product, but a year ago, it looked like a very promising technology. Some people complain about the lack of an optical viewer, but I don't see the need. The built-in LCD is great, you can tilt, turn and swivel it into most any position. I admit to having banged the camera against my forehead a few times when I was trying to get a quick candid shot (darn SLR reflexes). 

On the MPEG recording: you click the shutter release and it records for 5 seconds. If you need a longer movie, you have to hold down the button until you're done. I think there's a 15 second limit, but not sure if this is just a limitation of the memory card (4MB doesn't go very far) or that's all the camera will allow. I only used it once to try to pan along with a robot that was moving on my desk -- don't ask! Image resolution was inadequate: 160x112 or 320x240.


-- Important consideration: price of memory cards --

Prices haven't fallen nearly as much for Sony Memory Sticks as they have for compact flash and smartmedia cards. I would not recommend this camera if you plan on taking lots of pictures (such as on vacation) where you don't have access to a computer to store them. Look for a camera with a CompactFlash+ Type II slot, you can buy an IBM Microdrive. Another solution is to buy a digital wallet and a memory stick adapter, but I like to keep things simple (if it's in the camera, it's less likely to get lost).

With my SLR, I can burn through 10 rolls a day if I ration myself, at high resolution, the provided 4MB memory stick takes about 4 pictures. A 64MB memory stick expands that to 32 -- equivalent to almost 1 roll of 36 exposure film. 

64MB Sony Memory Stick: $63.00 ($0.98/MB)
64MB Compact Flash card: $30.00 ($0.46/MB)
1GB IBM Microdrive (CF+II) $315.00 ($0.30/MB)


-- On filters and the lens--

There is a 28mm filter thread, so you can use all sorts of filters: close-up rings, warming filters, etc). I have a pair of step-up rings so that I can use my filters from my SLR setup. One potential problem is that the autofocus may get confused and it will hunt for the range, you can override with program AE settings, so it's no big deal.

The pictures are always sharp and look great. It's no SLR with slide film, but then neither is the Nikon D1, IMO. 


-- The last word --

If you can pick it up used for under $300 and desire the manual controls for creativity, then it's well worth the price. Just keep in mind the added expense of Sony Memory Sticks vs. everyone else.
