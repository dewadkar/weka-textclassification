            I use to own a 2000 Maxima SE, after buying my house I had to choose between the house or the car.  The house won.  I sold my Maxima and looked for a good used car.  I had always liked the looks of the Grand Prix and decided to check them out.  After several months of looking I found a cream puff.  Sitting on the lot was a 97 Grand Prix GT two door, black inside and out with only 54,000 miles on it.  After several days of going back and forth we reached a price and I drove the car home. The car looks "mean" like it is going fast sitting still.  The two door GT model is more sportier than SE model.  The seats are comfortable and with the power lumbar on the driver's side changes can be made during long road trips to keep you comfortable.  I don't know why a passenger power seat with lumbar is not offered also.  The backseat is OK for one person they can stretch out across the seat if needed, if you add two they are miserable.  It is well served used for kids or packages.

It has every option available except the power sunroof.  Options include: headsup display, am/fm cassette with 10 disc changer in trunk & equalizer, power driver seat with lumbar, heated driver seat, tire pressure monitor system, overhead console, power windows & doors.  By far the heads up display is the best invention since sliced bread.  A unit in the dash displays your speed, radio/cd channel, bright head light indicator, turn signals, and gauge warning lights such as low fuel or check engine soon.  While driving you don't have to take your eyes off the road to see your speed, or your radio channel.  You can change radio stations, cd tracks or volume with the steering wheel controls and see the results on the windshield.  This should be standard equipment on all cars in my opinion. The raido/cd player is easy to operate and delivers quality sound.  Load the changer and you have about 8 to 11 hours of music at your finger tips.

The 3800 Series II engine delivers power on demand, don't get me wrong it's not a race car and it won't do 0-60 in 5 seconds but it is a strong engine that can more than move the car down the road.  The engine sounds smooth and has given no trouble what so ever.  These engines are known for their durability.

The only major problems I have is that the passenger side window would not come up at times without pulling on it.  This was replaced by the dealer as the car was a GM certified used car.  They replaced the window motor and control module.  The other problem while more trival is the automatic head light control that switches between daytime running lights and night time head lights.  The photo cell seems to be very sensitive to light and comes on very early in the evening and stays on longer in the morning hours.  I have been told to have the photo cell eye replaced and that would correct the problem.  I have yet to do that.

I had heard stories that the car didn't handle well on curves or at high speed but I have found that to be untrue.  While the car doesn't have it's original tires, it now has Goodyear Aquatreads on it.  This car handles very well in curves and at higher speeds.  The car feels matted to the road and is a joy to drive.

All in all my 97 Grand Prix has been a very dependable & fun car to drive.  I know that there are some rattles and squeaks but nothing out of the ordinary for a five year old car.  I would recomend one to anyone looking for a good used car.
