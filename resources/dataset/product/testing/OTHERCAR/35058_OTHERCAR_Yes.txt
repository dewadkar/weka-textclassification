            UPDATE AT END OF REVIEW


After months of searching for the best car for me I decided on the Land Rover Discovery Series II. I have always loved they way this car looks; and was even more impressed with its capabilities. As a result I just put a deposit on this machine. I cannot wait until it comes.


I like to drive off road. Not a lot but enough that I had to put new springs, shocks and tires on my Jeep Cherokee (which I will be sad to part with) to make it a competent off-road vehicle. The Disco will need nothing. It is an off road machine. There is no vehicle more capable off the production line for off road use than a land rover. they are the best 4x4xfar. The disco's off road capabilities coupled with its good looks turned me on to this vehicle.

The deal sealer was the ride and comfort. This car is as beautiful inside as it is outside. the English take pride in their craftsmanship and it shows. the seats are like your favorite couch or easy chair. Give me a beer and a sporting event and I'm not leaving. In fact, if this car was not so much fun to drive the seats would lull you into a deep slumber. And it is fun to drive. Keep in mind it is a truck so do not expect the speed and handling of a Porsche. And stay away from the ACE. After much thought me and the 3 dealerships I priced the car at agree that it is a waste of $3,000. If you need it then buy a car. Use the money and go on a trip, buy a new watch, give it to charity but don't waste it on this option.

Like I said this is the right car for me. I test drove them all. If you are not driving off road the Mercedes ML series and the Lexus were the others that rose above the rest. the Jeep Grand Cherokee, Ford Explorer, and others felt too plastic for the price.

Once I take delivery and have the car for a bit I'll update the review.

UPDATE: I finally took delivery of the vehicle and have lived with it for a little bit. I haven't had a chance to drive the car off-road so this is just an on-road update. Here are the updates:
1)If you need the car immediately do not order it. Take one off the lot. I waited nearly 8weeks for the car I wanted to be made. I had no problem with this because I was not bound by a lease and I wanted specific color combinations and options.
2)The car is more enjoyable to drive now that I own it. The only complaints are at times I find myself hunching over at stoplights to see when it changes and there is a big blind spot near the passenger doors.
3)I do have 2 small problems with the car. First the compass on the rearview mirror sketches out from time to time and there is a small squeak in the drivers side seat. I haven't called the dealer about these problems and figured I'd get them checked when it goes in for service at 7,000 miles. I don't want to part with the car quite yet.

All in all if anything my opinion of the car has increased. I do have one word of advice as you read these opinions. Distinguish the series one opinions from the series two. There were a plethora of problems with the series one that are not at issue with the series two.<br><br>
