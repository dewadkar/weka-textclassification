            The new Dodge 5.8L Magnum V8 is not only high in performance, the drive train power, and the quad cab luxury but definitely has power to spare. Whether pulling my boat with no hesitation or hauling a load of lumber this is the toughest truck yet!  As a previous Ford owner it out handles loaded and unloaded.  Not to underestimate the comfort of the club cab with the easy access four doors you will be impressed with the driver friendly interior components.  If you'll take the test challenge you will be impressed as I am.  Don't take my word for it test drive it yourself!!<br><br>
