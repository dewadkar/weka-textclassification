            The Nissan Pathfinder has many more positives than negatives going for it.  The SUV drives very easily, although it doesn't handle completely like a car.  As with any narrow, tall SUV, you have that feeling that a sharp turn could send you rolling over.

The inside of the Pathfinder is very roomy, especially in the front.  The back seat was not meant for tall passengers because of a shorter roof and not much leg room.  The sound system is great and sounds the same throughout the vehicle.  The A/C cools the whole vehicle quickly.

Cons:  With a car full of adults, we have noticed some hesitation on quick accelerations.  Sometimes, this is even accompanied by a noise, which of course can't be explained by the mechanic.  Also, there is a whistling coming from the driver's side window, although this can't be explained either.

We test-drove many cars and SUVs, but decided on the Pathfinder because of reliability and functionability.<br><br>
