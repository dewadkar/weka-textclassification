                 I was an very big believer in buying American cars. I learned this from my dad who was a Chevy fan his entire life.  A few years ago, my mother bought a Toyota Camry. I was shocked!  My parents told me that they were &quot;coerced&quot; into test driving one by a car salesman and fell in love with it.  I had to see for myself what all the fuss was about and drove my mother's car.  I was very pleased with it and decided that I would not be outdone.  I bought a Camry soon after.  It was a 1996 model and I owned it until the end of 1997, when the '98 model came out.  I test drove one and found the new model to be improved in all the right ways. It handles very well, rides smooth, and the four cylinder engine has all the power of most V-6's I've driven.  The interior is comfortable and the controls and seats can all be adjusted to fit perfectly.  The stereo system is great, the Toyota CD player is worth every penny.  I have never had either one of my Toyota's break down or give even the smallest amount of mechanical trouble and could not be more impressed with the reliability.  The body style of the car is classic yet not plain, I got the gold trim added plus the sunroof.  Driving this car is comfortable, to say the least.  I drive all day for my job and look forward to getting in my car.  I can't think of any reasons not to buy a Camry and feel that anyone who drives a sedan would appreciate the quality of this car.<br><br>
