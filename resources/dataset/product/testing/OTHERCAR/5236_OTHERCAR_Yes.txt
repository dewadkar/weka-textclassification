            I bought my two door 1999 Mirage brand new.  I thought it was cute and affordable.  The worst thing that was wrong with my car was the wind noise but the company gladly fixed it.  I do wish it was a standard, but it is not.  The car is compact so it is easy to park at my college, and it gets in and out of traffic easy.  The gas mileage is great.  I get about 20-23 miles per gallon. It only takes 10 or 15 dollars to fill it up.  I would not recommend anyone who has children to get the two door.  I don't know anything about the four doors, but they look nice.  I am 5'8, and I have plenty of room in my car.  My boyfriend is 6'2 and he can drive it just fine.  We have taken it on trips and have enjoyed the ride.  The car rides smooth and does not rattle.  I do not recommend anyone travel in the back seats, there is not much room back there.  If you are single and have no small children, this car would be great.  it makes a great school car for those who want a new car but can't afford the &quot;sporty&quot; cars.  I have enjoyed my car so much for the past year I would recommend it to anyone.     <br><br>
