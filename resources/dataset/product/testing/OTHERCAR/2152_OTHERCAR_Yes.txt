            After owning three Troopers, it was uncanny that my Rodeo could feel like an upgrade. And after nearly three decades of owning Porsche 911s, it was the Rodeo that I was selecting to drive most often... imagine!

It has the height, comfort and stability of a Sports Utility Vehicle but the handling and zip of a sports car. Unlike the trendy Jeep Cherokee and the pricey Land Rover, the Rodeo has the spunk and responsiveness of an automobile rather than of a truck. Isuzu's more deluxe and spacious model, the Trooper, has a clumsy and overbearing feel as compared with the stylish, sleek and sporty Rodeo.

In my experience, all SUVs are well-equipped with thoughtfully designed interior features and the Rodeo does compare well. It is in the precision steering, the road-hugging and surprising power that the Rodeo earns my approval as a fun vehicle with all the benefits of an intermediate sports utility truck. This durability and surprising low maintenance is made available at a highly competitive and reasonable price. The Rodeo will be my choice for years to come. <br><br>
