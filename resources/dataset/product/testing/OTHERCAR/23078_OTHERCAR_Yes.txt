              I purchased my pdc640 while on vacation. It was on sale at Target, and I forgot to bring my 35 milimeter camera. I began using it without reading the instructions, so it is relatively easy to use. I believe the price has come down on them since I bought mine, but I feel that it was a good buy at the time for my first digital camera. 
   
  That would be the point I would want to stress about this camera - that it is a good &quot;first&quot; digital camera. I feel that I have learned alot by using it, and when I am ready to move on to a megapixel camera, I will know more of what I am looking for. (When I upgrade, I intend to pass this camera on to my 5 year old daughter, so it is very easy to use.)
