I currently own a Ram that is enduring its last few years.  My '85 half-ton has given me several years of great service.  I purchased the &quot;318&quot; not for its gas mileage, of course, but as my main transportation vehicle that would, in addition, tow a horse trailer behind it on leisurely days.  I was assured by friends of mine that it would provide good service in these areas, as it has.  The previous owners hauled stock trailers with it many times, full of cattle, a task many would think a bit large for a pickup of its size.  The only drawback I have found were no fault of the manufacturer.  I moved to an area of snowfall, and the rear-wheel drive characteristic of the vehicle is not a positive aspect.  
But, I remain satisfied with my Ram, and I would like my next vehicle to be a Dodge, in the hopes that I will find another reliable truck similar to the one I have.<br><br>
