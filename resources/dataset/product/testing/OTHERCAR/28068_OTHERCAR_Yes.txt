            Over the past 20 years I've been a loyal Honda owner, though I've strayed a few times (Nissan & Plymouth), I've always felt more comfortable with my more than reliable Honda.  

Two years ago I had a baby, and bought a Honda Accord because we needed a four door and larger car than what we had (in order to prepare for the baby).  The baby is now two, and we found that the Accord just wasn't big enough anymore for all the cargo we had that went along with having a family.  

I've always liked a sporty car and dreaded the thought of having to drive a big, bulky, FAMILY car (I felt old (38))!!  Anyway, I compared the Impala to many cars and found this one to be largest in interior size with many extras in it's price range (21,000-24,000).

Though reluctant to give up my Honda, I ended up trading it in (2 yrs old) and buying a black LS (with spoiler), fully loaded with moon-roof, leather seats, upgraded stereo system and many extras.  

Considering I could never see myself in a family car and to my surprise; I really like this car - my only gripes are that the car is a bit noisy, the glove box is small and I think the plastic interior needs some improvement on it's quality.  Other than that - both my husband, myself and even the baby like the car. The baby's feet no longer lay on the headrests of the car (like in the Honda) and he has leg room now. Even some on my friends (25-35) really like the look of this sporty family car.  


PS.  This would not be a car of my choice if I didn't have a child, but I do like the car.
