            I'm the first to admit that he high price was somewhat of a road block to purchase but, I'm glad I found my way around it.
This is a nifty little camera well worth the price.. The pictures are clear and true to color.. The camera has various options for exposure (fun to play with). You can do b&w, solarize, sepia, and negative art. The camera can be adjusted for sharpness, white background, date stamp, outdoor, indoor, image size, zoom, and a host of others.
The LCD monitor shows battery status, the settings you have chosen, number of shots taken, etc. You can review your pictures instantly-save them or delete them. With the supplied cable you can view your pictures on your TV or computer.. You can view them as a slide show with YOUR timing of frames..With a color printer on your computer you can print quality photos at YOUR convenience. 
NOT TO BE OVERLOOKED the ability to photo and store the inventory of your home or apartment for insurance purposes.
THIS PURPOSE ALONE JUSTIFIES THE PURCHASE OF THIS CAMERA!
