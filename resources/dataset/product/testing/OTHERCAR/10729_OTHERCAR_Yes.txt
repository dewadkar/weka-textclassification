            In 1998 I bought a 1983 Buick Regal Coupe. You could tell the car was 15 years old by looking at it but not by driving it. Of course, it had a few things that needed fixing. The previous owner had driven it with bad brakes until one side of the rotor was worn away, and the water pump was going. However, when you buy a used car you have to expect to fix something(s). 

It was not my first car but it would definately make a good first car for anyone. Here's why. First it is easy to work on. All you need is a Chiltons Manual. I, myself,did not do the brake job, but I did do the water pump! A job that a mechanic charges around $400 dollars for! I know, I had it priced. The area around the engine block is a little small for a conventional spark plug change. However, if you are creative, as I was, you will use a couple of extensions and Voila you can do this yourself also.

Second, it is fairly large. This taught me some really good depth perception manuvering into parking spaces. I can drive just about any sized car now. Plus, this is also a good feature if you are a teenager. You know teenagers always have to fit all of their friends in the car. 

Third, it is a fairly comfortable ride, especially for long trips. When I lived 2 hours from my family I drove to see them at least twice a month. Even after 15 years of people sitting in these seats they were still comfortable. 

Yes, it is old, but in my opinion I would rather have an old car I can work on myself than a new car that I have to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars to have repaired. I have owned two of these, 1982 and 1983, and I would buy another in a heartbeat! <br><br>
