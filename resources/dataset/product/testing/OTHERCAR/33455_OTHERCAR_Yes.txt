            My wife and received this camera as a wedding gift, and it is the first digital camera we've ever owned.  As a video professional, I am picky about my photography and video equipment, so I didn't think I'd like this relatively inexpensive camera.

As it turns out, it's a great little point-and-shoot, and works out very well for your average family photography needs.

The camera is small enough and light enough that it can easily be carried around in a jacket pocket or even a shirt pocket.  Activating the camera is as easy as slipping open the very hand-friendly retractable lens cover.  The zoom is a rocker switch on the top of the camera, which is a bit small and difficult to use.  The shutter is activated by a large silver button next to the zoom rocker.

The playback mode (in which you view the pictures you've taken) is activated by a small button on the back of the camera, and is easily navigated with the four directional arrow buttons on the back of the camera.  You can navigate by moving forward and backward picture-by-picture, or by looking at a thumbnail screen and selecting from nine thumbnails (this makes for quick navigation when you have a lot of pictures stored).

The smartmedia card is reliable, though you will most likely need a bigger card than the 32M card that is included with the camera.  Our 128M card can hold about 260 high-quality pictures, as well as a couple of 15-second movies.  Switching media cards is very easy, and the casing which protects both the card and the lens is durable.

The downside of the cards is that, unless you're using an OEM card, you can't use the panoramic picture mode, which can be very handy if you want to shoot large landscapes (basically, it's a picture which is twice as wide as a standard shot).

The interface is, for the most part, very easy, and finding the bells and whistles (such as sepia tone and picture rotation) requires only a couple of clicks within the internal menu.  The LCD screen is very bright, and has proven more than adequate in well-lit areas.  Direct sunlight renders the LCD almost unreadable, but covering it with the shadow of your hand will do just fine to check out your pictures.

The flash is adequate for reasonably-distanced pictures, but forget about a decent background if your subject is more than a few feet from the backdrop.  The camera does not do well in low light, and anything short of sunlight requires a flash.  If you choose to manually override the flash, you'll be certain to get a shutter speed so short that, unless you're using a tripod, will leave your picture blurred.  The color in low-light pictures without the flash seems to lean heavily toward the yellow-orange side as well, which suggests to me that perhaps the camera is assuming a flash in its white balance, even if the flash has been manually overridden.

The recharge of the flash can take 30 seconds or more, depending on how well-charged your batteries are.  The camera uses batteries quite quickly, so if you intend to purchase this camera, get some rechargables and a charger.  There is no charging port built in to the D-520 Zoom, so you'll have to have a separate battery charger.  As always, the batteries get zapped much quicker if you use the LCD screen instead of the viewfinder to look at your pictures.

This camera provides great material for prints, and looks like a standard SLR all the way up to an 8x10.  Only the trained eye can tell the difference between the JPG image and the film print through the 8x10 size...after that the JPG artifacts and pixellations become visible.  As with most Olympus products, the optics look fantastic, and, provided that you have enough light in your shot, you will be very happy with the color and detail captured by the Olympus lens.
