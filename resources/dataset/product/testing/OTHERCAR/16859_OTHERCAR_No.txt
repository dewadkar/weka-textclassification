            I purchased this camera hoping to replace my fairly cheap Samsung 35mm.  I was impressed by it's powerful zoom, however, unless it's a bright day, using the zoom causes the pictures to blur and it's useless at night.  Night pictures in general were unreliable and grainy, and without a viewfinder, next to impossible to aim in the dark.  Even outdoors during the day, if the sky is overcast with clouds, the picture subject was surrounded by black background.  I could aim this camera in one direction and get a decent shot, aim the camera a few more feet in a different direction and the shot would be terrible.  Overall, the picture quality was poor and unreliable do to a lack of fine detail (especially on furry animals and birds), and often underexposed pictures.  

The floppy disks made it easy to transfer files to your computer, but expect to swap many floppies while shooting and floppy disks do not come close to comparing to USB for speed in downloading to your computer.  

I did like Sony's battery system because it is a rechargeable system that doesn't loose it's charge if not used for a while and the camera itself recharges the battery.  Some people may also appreciate the display in minutes remaining.  Navigating through the menus could have been made quicker, but overall, the navigation was simple.<br><br>
