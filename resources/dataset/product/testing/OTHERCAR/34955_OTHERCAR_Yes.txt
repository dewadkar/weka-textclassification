            Back in September of 2000, my wife and I purchased a 2000 Grand Prix GT.  Our car came with option package 1SC, sunroof and a few other misc options that racked up a MSRP of $24,550.  The car was purchased at the end of the model year when a $2000 cash back offer was available.  I am also eligible for the GM supplier discount which knocked another $2000 off MSRP leaving the purchase price around $20,500.  

The items below are my observations over the past year and a half.


Drivetrain:  
The base model SE comes equipped with a 3.1L V6 which is adequate under normal driving conditions but not very impressive.  The 3.8L V6 engine is found in the GT model and a supercharged 3.8L V6 accompanies the GTP.  The 3.8L engine creates 200HP but more importantly 240ft-lbs of torque.  If you opt for the supercharged GTP model you get 240HP and 280ft-lbs of torque.  The vehicle moves from a stoplight with ease and there seems to be ample power through all ranges of speeds.  The 3.8L V6 is also one of the most reliable engines GM has manufactured in recent years.  The automatic transmission shifts through the gears smoothly and shifts are appropriately timed.

Fuel Economy:
The window sticker on our Grand Prix shows estimated mileages of 20 city and 29 highway.  With a mix of city and highway driving, I have averaged 23 MPG over the past 18 months.  On long stretches of pure highway driving I average 28-30 MPG.

Suspension: 
The Grand Prix has an excellent suspension system.  The car handles corners very well.  Body roll is minimal around corners.  The turning radius is tight for a car this size.  The ride is more on the sportier side so you tend to feel a few more bumps.  If you are looking for the same performance but a smoother ride, I would recommend the Buick Regal.

Interior:   
The interior of the Grand Prix is fairly straightforward, nothing too flashy or out of the ordinary.  The bucket seats are comfortable for extended periods of time and the 6-way power driver seat provides ample room for adjustment.  There is plenty of legroom for front and rear passengers.  I recently took a trip with three other males and myself ranging from 6�-0� to 6�-2� tall and no one complained about legroom.  We did notice that the car does not have much headroom when compared to similar cars in its class.  I have to move my head to flip down the sun visor and I am only 6�-0� tall.

There is a lot of plastic on the dash and console of the car which gives it a cheap look.  The materials do not appear to be very high quality and I suspect that this car will have a squeaky dash in a few years.  The armrest between the driver and passenger seat already squeaks when you rest your arm on it.  Another downfall of the interior design is that GM still insists on having turn signals, windshield wiper controls and cruise control integrated into one stick off the steering column.  There is just too much going on in one space.  I suspect that it is cheaper to manufacturer a vehicle this way but its time for GM to wake up and take some notes from their competition on this one.

Steering wheel radio controls are a welcome convenience.  Adjustments are easily made to the stereo as the buttons are large and easy to identify.  The dual zone climate control option on our Grand Prix is a very nice feature to have.  Set the temperature you would like and then forget about it.  

Pontiac chooses to use amber colored lights to light up gages and displays on the dashboard which is similar to airplane cockpits.  In theory, the amber color gages do not create a glare and are easier on the eyes at night.  I found the gages easy to read but others may disagree.

Exterior:   
The Grand Prix has a sporty looking exterior.  Body lines are smooth and there is not an excessive amount of plastic body cladding like several other Pontiacs (Sunfire, Grand Am, Aztek).   Since exterior opinions are very subjective, I�ll leave it at that.

Problems to Date:  
Around 8000 miles, an LED was flashing sporadically on the dual zone climate control window.  The dealer replaced the climate control module due to a loose wire inside.  At 22,000 miles there are no other problems to report.

When shopping for a mid-full sized car for the family, the Grand Prix should not be overlooked.
