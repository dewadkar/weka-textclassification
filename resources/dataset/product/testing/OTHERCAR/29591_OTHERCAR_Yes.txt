            My husband bought me this vehicle for Christmas last year. I have the two tone black and silver Nissan Quest SE. I love the leather seats, the 6 disk CD changer, the sun roof, the removable captains chairs. I have never liked mini-vans but this car drives great. I am a hard driver and this car handles like my husbands Maxima (if not better) the suspension is tight! It has the larger wheels and tires on it too. There is a lot of room for kids stuff galore! The shelf in the back comes in handy for groceries, strollers, shopping bags.

The advantages of this car:
quiet, smooth ride
tight handling
sporty
luxurious inside
boomin' bose sound system
kids love it (ours came with a TV/VCP that can be hard mounted although we didn't)
great gas mileage

The disadvantages:
Ours makes a funny noise when you start the car and the A/C is running - a boom!
The sun roof could be positioned just a tad back. When it is opened the sun shines right in my eyes and the wind deflector - does not deflect wind. Even though we often would like to have the entire sun roof open - we end up closing it just after we get it open.
the sunroof is electric but opens slowly! They need to make a one touch button to open it.
The horn is hard to find when you really need to honk it fast.
Poor Nissan customer service where we live (Nashville).
All the black sealing is coming off on the sliding doors and on the windsheild.
Cup holder broke first week we had it.


** one thing about the leather seats. I left my sun roof open one night and it iced/snowed all night long. The next afternoon I am in my home office and I look out the window to see how pretty the snow looks and I notice my sun roof open. We cleaned it up and the seats are still perfect AS IS the tv/vcp that was an entire block of ice.
