            My husband and I purchased our 1998 Mazda Protege after extensive research of compact cars.  I hate this noisy, costly automobile!!  As a commuter, I need a reliable automobile to get to and from work.  The Protege now has 60,000 miles.  During the past six months we have replaced part of the exhaust system, the air conditioner after most of it FELL OUT on the highway, and now it is &quot;bucking and purging&quot; at highway speeds above 50 MPH.  It has new brakes (which are expected to wear out) and a new timing belt, as well.  We have been very careful to change the oil regularly and take it in for regular tune-ups - all by authorized Mazda service centers. Aesthetically, it scratches and dents easily.  In our experience, nothing has been covered under the warranty.  We have always been loyal Honda owners, and will never own another Mazda.<br><br>
