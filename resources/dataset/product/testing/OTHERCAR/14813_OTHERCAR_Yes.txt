            In 1999, upon completing my graduate degree and entering the workforce I decided to get my first vehicle. Previously I had been borrowing older sedans from my family. I reviewed vehicles over the next few months by the following criteria: Affordability, Testimonial, Gas Mileage, Insurance and of course, glamour &amp; fun.  I searched online at Edmund's, AAA, and their links to learn as much as a layman with very little automotive knowledge could. I narrowed the list of what I wanted from more than a dozen to: Saturn SC2, Honda Accord, Mitsubishi 3000 GT, Jeep Cherokee Classic, Ford Mustang &amp; Pontiac Firebird Formula.

Notice how motley my list was. I spent another month test driving to further refine my choices. Test driving revealed more criteria such as seat comfort, maneuverability and impact issues. The Mustang &amp; SC2 were extremely uncomfortable so I eliminated them. The 3000GT was slightly more palatable in that respect.

I eliminated two fun cars based solely on comfort -- the SC2 was not fun just decorative. I was able to find front and side impact crash test data online &amp; on television. This eliminated the Cherokee. Despite having a 56 mile daily commute I discovered I cared more about crash safety than gas mileage. Insurance quotes narrowed my list to the Accord and the Firebird. These vehicles are far from similar but the Firebird excelled during test drives.  I test drove them both over rough streets with potholes, windy roads and on the freeway during rush hour to simulate my commute.

Both cars seemed to roll smoothly over rough roads. However, I found that I felt I could flee a tough situation more easily in the Firebird. During the test drive I was nearly side swiped by a similar vehicle. Since leasing it I've noticed that I drive just for fun. I drive down winding country roads and take long freeway trips.

Ultimately I feel safe in this car and feel great about survival chances after a crash. I love the way the engine sounds. The bulbs for the signals had to be replaced after the first year. I have noticed a slight tendency to fishtail but I'm not sure whether it is the vehicle or my zealous driving style. The Firebird Formula can take relatively sharp turns at speeds over 40mph. It does seem to hydroplane over small amounts of water, like thin streams but not over standing water. This can be somewhat nerve wracking but I have never had a spin out because of it. 

I don't think I could have made a better selection despite the aforementioned. However, it is a good fit for me because I am single, childless and rarely have more than one passenger. If I had children or had to drive around a couple extra people I would not have selected this vehicle. The back seat is cramped. Ironically, I have found that it has more than ample trunk space and have been able to make trips to Costco, Home Depot &amp; KMart without having to unload the trunk.

In short, the 1999 Firebird Formula exemplifies Pontiac's old slogan, &quot;We build Excitement.&quot;<br><br>
