            I have owned my 1993 Chevy S-10 Blazer for almost one year.  This is a 4.3 Liter V-6, High Output (CPI Injection, or "Vortec"), and is equipped with 4WD as well.  In the time I've owned this vehicle, I've had to put a complete exhaust system on it ($468.17), an EGR Valve ($326.44), an oxygen sensor ($149.99), a throttle positioning sensor ($84.17), a complete tune up, which includes: spark plugs, wires, cap, rotor, ignition module, ignition coil, fuel filter, and a pcv valve, which cost me $368.92 with labor.  This was a one owner vehicle when I purchased it from it's private owner, who took very good care of it.  When I bought it, I also received a large folder full of receipts, from what he had done to it.  So, in one year, I spent $1397.69, and that was ONLY in emissions related repairs, so it would pass our state emissions test successfully.  Then, it needed ball joints, all four cost me $538.71, and it also needed shocks, which cost me $292.78 total with labor included on both repairs.  So, there's another $831.49 in repairs within the year I've owned this vehicle.
My advice to anyone who is thinking of purchasing a Blazer, is to have it carefully inspected prior to buying it, and make sure you're buying a Blazer with the VIN code of "Z", which is the "throttle body" fuel injection system.  The High Output (or CPI, vin code W) is simply too expensive to have worked on, even if you do the work yourself.  When my Blazer runs good, it is very quick, and gets great fuel mileage, but when it breaks, it is very costly to fix it.  I am getting ready to trade it off, or sell it, simply due to the extreme repair costs.  This is a very comfortable vehicle to drive for long periods of time, and also is a very attractive vehicle to own.  The Blazer holds it's value very well also.  My Blazer is a '93 4x4 Tahoe (S-10), with 130,000 miles on it, and still holds a NADA Book Value of over $6500.00, which is not bad for a nearly 10 year old vehicle.  Overall, I would say it's okay to purchase a Blazer, as long as you purchase the Throttle Body Injected Blazer only, they are very reliable, comfortable, attractive, and cheap to operate.  My neighbor has a '92, with the throttle body injection, and he is a courier here in St. Louis, and he has almost 500,000 miles on the origninal engine and transmission.  I simply made a mistake by purchasing a "vortec" or CPI Injected Blazer.  The parts are literally 3 times more expensive on the CPI, than the Throttle Body Blazers.  I hope this epinion has been helpful to anyone who's looking for a Blazer in the '91-'94 year range, and thank you very much for reading my epinion!!! Have a great day!!!
