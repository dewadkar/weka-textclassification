            I am one who rents vehicles a lot in order to be able to see what might actually be able to purchase at a later date.  The Chrysler Sebring Convertible is one extremely fun vehicle to drive.  The handling is super.  The time I rented one I drove through a snow storm and it handled better than vehicles that had 4 wheel drive.  I drove with more common sense but I never went off of the road either.  I enjoyed the week I rented this car.  If I had to chose between a Monte Carlo, the Chrysler would win all the time.  My personal car is a Ford which I have driven since it was brand new and it handles better than most vehicles on the road today.  Highway performance is great while city performance enjoyable for the Chrysler.  The good is of easy top and down just unlatch and push the button and windows go down.  The bad is trying to figure out some of the items on the dash, as to what in the world they are referring to.
