                My family just bought a brand spankin new 99 Suburban,  and it is more than I could ever have asked for.  The power, control, room, style, and saftey of the Suburban is unbelievable.  First, this Truck has incredible power.  Yes, I call it a truck because it has the power of a Z-71.  Another advantage of the Suburban is the room,  if you have a large family it is perfect because it can fit eight people easily.  Also,  everybody loves the style, that is why it is still such a big hit in America.  As far as saftey goes,  I don't think that there is a safer truck around.  I would advise anyone with the money to buy a suburban to do so,  because it is just an all around, all terrain truck<br><br>
