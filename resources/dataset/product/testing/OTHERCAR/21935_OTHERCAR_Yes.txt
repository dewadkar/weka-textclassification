            Ok, yes, my husband actually PAID for it &amp; really thought HE was getting a truck...but I LOVE it &amp; he really doesn't get to use it much! 

 We have the 2000 4 wheel drive extended cab truck in indigo blue.  The only options we got were tinted back window &amp; air conditioning.  The next option package would have added about $1500 to the cost (we have GM discount so it may be different for you) but we really felt the side moldings didn't add much to it in our opinion as far as making it look better, in fact, we both preferred it without the side moldings.  

The back is very roomy, we fit my husband (225 pounds) me (6 months pregnant) &amp; his mom (average size) in back with room to spare &amp; no cramped legs.  We currently have 3 car seats in back &amp; I'm able to climb up &amp; fasten in each kid (while standing up in the back seat) with no problems using the third door located on the passenger side. 

 Previously, I drove a '92 Caprice Classic &amp; just loved that, but this is just so much more roomier.  Once the baby comes, we plan on moving a booster seat to the front passenger side (air bag turns off with the ignition key) &amp; I will sit in the middle (the front middle seat is unsafe for car seats according to the manual).  There will still be plenty of room for me there since we tried that out before purchasing to make sure it would all work out.  

We still haven't tried out the four wheel drive, even though we've gone through quite a bit of snow &amp; she handled great so we're quite pleased as Michigan winters aren't always so kind!<br><br>
