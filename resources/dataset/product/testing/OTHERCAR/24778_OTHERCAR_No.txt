            Well to begin with, I am the type of person that gets something only if Im completely satisfied with it, or feel it is the best product out there. I am not a professional photographer but rather someone who was looking for a camera to take on trips and to just randomly take pictures whenever I felt like it. The only other digital camera I am familiar with is the Canon s230. I dont own that camera, but I have a family member that does and I used it quite a few times. So I got to the store to buy the Canon s230 only to find out that it was discontinued and replaced by the more expensive s400 or the cheaper A70. The s400 seems like a nice camera, but was well beyond my budget. And the A70 lacked in features that I liked about the s230 namely the metal casing and the rechargeable battery. So I talked to the salesman and he introduced me to the Olympus Stylus 300. My first impression was, wow this is a cool looking camera and it had most of the features that I want.

Now Im going to cut to the important stuff which is, using the camera. 

There were three issues with the camera that caused me to make the decision to return it:


<b>1) Picture Quality </b>
In general the picture quality is good and compares to that of other quality cameras in the same price range. BUT, one issue with picture quality happened quite often and I definately never had this problem with the Canon S230. Too many times, the pictures were Blurry!! I would have the steadiest hand and yet (sometimes, maybe 10% of the time) the pictures would not be sharp and be blurry. In some cases, the pictures were so blurry that it was like I was waving my arm up and down, while taking the picture. Other reviewsd praise the picture quality of this camera, but did anyone else have this problem? This was my experience and it was very disappointing. 

<b>2) Flash </b>
Again, I could not believe how bad the flash is with this camera. I usually had it on Auto flash, but how does this camera detect whether there is enough light or not??? Because it does a terrible job. Unless the sun is glaring at the camera, the flash comes on! Bright outdoor shots still caused the flash to come  on. The worst was indoor shots. In so many cases, I would take a picture in a semi-lit room and the pictures would come out dark and lacking much color. This is in auto-flash mode. So I would manually turn off the flash and voila, the pictures come out bright and colorful. Why isnt the camera detecting whether it should use flash or not, properly. 

<b>3) User-Interface </b>
If anyone has used a camera like the s230 then no way you can use the Stylus 300 and say it is easy to use. I found the menu quite confusing. You will need to look at the manual to first understand anything about the menu. When I picked up the s230 I was able to use it right away, without looking at the manual and I was able to use some advanced features. The Stylus on the other hand, I found that layout was very confusing and not flowing properly. There were no text descriptions or explanations on the display to tell you what the options/selections are. The icons they used dont really mean or say anything. When I first picked up the camera, I got frusterated at doing the most simple things. It does not, compare in any way whatsoever to the interface on the Canon cameras which I thought was extremely easy and friendly to use. Ofcourse it did get better, the more I used the camera and looked at the manual, but it still was not an enjoyable experience.

<b> Conclusion </b>

I will not mention anything else about the camera, and ofcourse the camera had positives. But after the above three points, there is nothing left to make me want the camera. Dont get me wrong, I was extremely excited when I bought this camera and I had high-expectations. But when I used it I realized that it is definately lacking and in my opinion its worse than other cameras out there.
