            I am very impressed with the 99 Lexus RX-300.  The comfort of the ride is excellent.    
     The 99 model was rated the best according to Dateline in that class of crash tests.  There were VERY minimum injuries and the safety cage just barely buckled.  It has SRS (supplemental restraint system) airbags passenger and driver.  It also has side airbags.  
     This Lexus, you can get with or without 4WD.  It has traction control along with Quadra track.  Quadra track means that the power can be sent from side to side, and front to back.  Unlike with some other SUV's (Jeep, Subaru), it can't send ALL the power to one wheel.  
The 4WD system is automatic.  The good thing about that is that with other SUV's where you have to push a button to engage full time 4WD, the axles lock and unlock, automatically unlike with full time 4WD where they do lock.  When they lock, it binds when you turn which isn't good.
     There is a snow button for when you are in deep snow or stuck.  When you are stuck, you also have an overdrive button.  There is also a power button (very useful).  Usually you use then when you want to yield or speed up very quickly.  
     This SUV is a V6 with 220 horse power.  I think that it needs a V8.  3.0-liter, four-cam, 24-valve engine. 
      Most everything in this SUV is electronic. Traction control, electronically controlled transmission, vehicle skid control ect.
     The interior is leather.  The front seats are very comfortable with electronic adjustment and also heated.  The front seatbelts are adjustable so they don't cut you off in the neck.  There is a VERY nice console in the middle.    
In the back, there are two adjustments for the back of the seat.  There is an armrest in the middle.  There isn't too much leg room in the back though.  There is a heat/AC vent in the back.  
     There is a very nice sound system in the Lexus RX-300.  7 speakers.  In the front, there are two door speakers along with two tweeters.  In the back seat there are two more door speakers and one speaker in the very back.  Everything with the sound system is adjustable (bass, treble, fade, balance).  There is also a 5 CD changer which is located in the glove compartment.

The Lexus is overall, a very good SUV.  If you have any questions about it, please e-mail me at-
