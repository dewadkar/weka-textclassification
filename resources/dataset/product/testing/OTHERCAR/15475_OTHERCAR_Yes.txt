            My day job is as an I.S. Administrator.  I was sent on a mission to investigate digital cameras for my company.  The company is a mortgage lender for agricultural properties.  There are currently 12 people who take pictures of properties as part of their jobs as Appraisers.  They asked for a camera that would 1) take the pictures they wanted, 2) make it easy to get to those pictures and 3) make it easy to get those pictures into portfolios for use by loan officers/Chief Officers and other appraisers.
  I tried out 7 cameras and this is the one I recommended.  The primary reason for my recommendation is the 3.5&quot; floppy access.  Take the picture; take the floppy out and insert it into any 3.5&quot; floppy drive (by the way, ALL computers have a floppy drive)and then double click on the JPG file on the floppy.  THAT'S IT!!!!!!!!!!!
  No software to load.  No dongles or serial cables to install.  No special attachments to worry about.  No special media to carry pictures on (Smart/Flash cards).  You see, what everyone is looking for is ease of application.  Not all computers have the download software on them.  Not all computers have a serial download cable available.  Not all computers can read smart media.  BUT ...  All computers have a floppy drive.  ALL computers come with image software to look at pictures (IE3.01 or greater).  And the camera makes disk copies all by itself so you can share with friends.  This is the ONLY way to go regarding digital cameras (as long as you don't need special graphics)<br><br>
