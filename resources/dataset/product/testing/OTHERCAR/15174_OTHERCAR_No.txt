            Got this camera about 3months ago.  I paid about $220 for a refurb, for the price it is hard to beat.  But the camera has quite a few drawbacks;
1. the picture quality is good, but still rather grainy, I can't say if it prints well or not.
2. Only 2x zoom, for the size of camera it is not much
3. Battery door seems to be a little flimsy and is difficult
4. The navigation button is a pain. (Pls just use up/down, left/right and enter buttons, no reason for rocker).
5. BIG Problem: it takes about 3sec after you press the button to take the picture, if you use red eye, it takes about 3 seconds to first flash and then about 2 seconds to red eye flash.
Pros:
1. 128MB SmartMedia support.  over 120 pics at highest picture level, over 240 at 2nd highest.
2. USB connection is fast and easy (Win 2000)
3. LCD is clear, great for previewing pictures
4. Menu system is good

If you are looking for a relatively inexpensive megapixel camera and don't require a great zoom, this is definitely one to look at, but buy the AC adapter also.  If you want or require good zoom, high-quality pictures, and quick snapshots look elsewhere.
