            I've owned several Volvos over the years (1982 245 GLT with m46 manual; 1983 245 GLT with aw71 automatic; 1984 245 GLT with aw71 automatic; 1985 245 GL with aw70 automatic) and my parents, aunts & uncles, and  two of my cousins own (or have owned) various 240, 740, 850, and S70 models. Without a doubt, they all love/loved their cars. I have personally been in two accidents (not my fault - thank you -lol) in two of my 245 wagons and my father rear-ended (his fault, obviously -lol) a Ford Explorer in his 1989 745 GL. All three wagons were "totaled" by the insurance companies but  we all walked away completely unscathed, except for rattled nerves and a few grey hairs. It's generally accepted in the volvo community (see various volvo fanatic websites - turbobricks.com, brickboard.com, swedishbricks.com, and the yahoo groups called SCVCOA) that the 200 and 700 series has the best engines and transmissions (the b21 and b230 family of Volvo 4 cyliners and the aw70 & aw71 trannys). The 850 and "S" & "V" series with their 5 cylinder engines are considered to be far less reliable and far more expensive to upkeep, although they are certainly far more powerful. People automatically assume that the latest Volvos are the safest, and one might think this logically makes sense, but we all know that newer isn't ALWAYS necessarily better. Case in point: I just went to a local volvo-only salvage yard here in San Diego where I bought a used third-seat for my current 1984 245 GLT. After talking to the owner and his son for about an hour and a half, I walked away with a newfound respect for the older Volvos, the 240s in particular. The father told me that in the 27 years he's been in this business, he's NEVER, EVER seen the "jaws of life" used on a Volvo 240 series. Never. He said he's never seen a 240 passenger cell that was compromised to the point where it basically failed to retain it's shape adequately enough to protect the passengers within. He said this only holds true for the 200 series for he's seen a few wrecked 700, 900, and 850s where the cell failed to live up to it's intended purpose. Now I don't know about you, but after driving many Volvos over the years and already thinking the old 240s to be the proverbial "tanks," and now hearing a guy who spent the past 27 years dealing with wrecked vehicles - and Volvos in particular - making statements like the above, well, I tend to consider myself to be a "believer" that newer isn't always better. Sure, the newer Volvos have a ton of safety features the old 240s couldn't dream of (side airbags, stability control, etc...) but they don't seem to be as well-made (structurally speaking) nor as reliable (or bullet-proof), nor as simple to maintain (I do my own minor wrenching on my 240s, but I wouldn't even TOUCH the 850 or newer versions) then the old tried-and-true antiquated workhorse that is the 240 series. My favorite (although mythical) 240 would be the last model year (1993) wagon with a b230FT turbo engine from a 740 along with the side airbags and stability control from the "V" series. Sounds crazy, eh?! LOL :-)
