            I bought my 1994 Pontiac Grand Am GT (with Quad 4, 5-speed stick) as a college student in 1994, and the vehicle is still a workhorse for me.  The engine has maintained its punch despite its 110,000-plus miles on it, and I have had few mechanical breakages other than standard parts wear that will go with a car that is over seven years old.  As of this writing, I have yet to have a light bulb burn out.  Gas mileage on the highway is a decent 33 miles per gallon, and city mileage will average 25 to 27, not bad and not great.

While my interior is not the top-level (standard cloth seats and electrical limited to locks only), the driver's side lock will not electrically unlock, my only glitch and minor in my mind.

This car was for me and remains in my opinion a great first new car purchase for a college graduate or at least a soon to be grad who can swing a 15 to 20 thousand dollar loan.  The '92 to '95 era Grand Ams are probably great used car purchases.  I plan to drive mine until it dies completely, and that looks like it will be awhile.
