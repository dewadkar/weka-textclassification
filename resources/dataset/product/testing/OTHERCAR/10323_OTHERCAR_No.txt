            In 1995, my wife and I bought a 1990 Mitsubishi Eclipse. To this day, it is the decision we most regret. It's a good thing we bought a warranty on that car, because we certainly had to use it!
First, the transmission went out. We used our warranty to get a new one put in. Then, the engine failed. Forty days after we paid a painfully huge sum of money in two installments ($1600) to buy a new engine, the &quot;new&quot; transmission went out! Every mechanic told us that it would cost at least a thousand dollars to rebuild the transmission. 
Meanwhile, the car fell apart piece by piece. Parts came off in our hands and in the hands of the mechanics. Soon, the door handles stopped working. Pieces of plastic around the doors came loose inside the car. The rear seat was too small, the shock absorbers didn't, and when we went over speed bumps in parking lots, back seat passengers bumped their heads on the cramping, low ceiling. 
One mechanic who would have sold us a right rear tire told us that even with his power tools, he could not remove the one we had.
And how could I forget the day I was driving through La Jolla, and was horrified to see white smoke AND black smoke spewing from my Mitsubishi at the same time?
Perhaps my most disappointing experience was the day I wanted to drive from San Diego to Los Angeles to visit family and friends, and to attend a once-in-a-lifetime event. This is only a 125 mile trip. But that car didn't even make it out of San Diego county! Some hose under the hood busted wide open, spewing nasty stuff, and I had to have that sorry car towed home.

At least the 3-band graphic equalizer and cruise control worked well.

Months later, a news report stated that the Mitsubishi Eclipse failed  safety tests and crash tests more miserably than any of the other cars tested. It got about one star out of five possible.
At least half of the Mitsubishi owners we know have had major problems with theirs, too. Down the street from us, another 1990 Mitsubishi eclipse sits in a driveway, gathering much dust.
Did you know that Mitsubishi corporation cuts down more acres of rainforest than any other corporation in the world? Please visit http://www.rainforest.org and http://www.savebajawhales.org, and see for yourself.

Please, learn from our most wrenching, horribly expensive mistake. I plead and I beseech you. To avoid bankruptcy, Never buy a Mitsubishi!
