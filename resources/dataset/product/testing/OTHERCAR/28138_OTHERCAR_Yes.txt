                 I bought my camera in December of 2000. I was working as a freelance journalist for a small town newspaper not far from where I live in Louisville,KY. 
    I needed a way to keep up with the times so I went searching for a digital camera that would do the job for the budget I had to work with,I looked at a variety of digital cameras. 
    I finally purchased the Polaroid PDC 700 at the urging of a Wal-mart Photo Lab Tech. She and I discussed the Polaroid 640 but she explained for what I needed that wouldn't do the job. The employee was very helpful (and she is one of the few that are at Wal-mart). Anyway, I looked at the PDC 700 model and I liked the features and the PRICE!
    I was pleased with the outcome of the pic's that I took and so was the editor of the newspaper. In fact, I was given the opportunity to write my own weekly feature column that was a tribute to the local law enforcement in a 3 county area. 
    I have gone on to better things. I am currently a photographer for a Professional Wrestling Organization. I am presently content with the PDC 700. It does a good job even in low light situations. Believe me I have had to take some wrestling photos in the worst of the worst light conditions. All light fixtures are not created equal.
    The ONLY three things that I find displeasing about the PDC 700 is there is no zoom and the battery consumption is ridiculous!! There is a default time delay when you depress the button to take a picture. You have to wait about five to ten seconds to shoot another. In the wrestling field this is definitely an annoyance. I inquired to Polaroid and was told there is no way to avoid this delay.
