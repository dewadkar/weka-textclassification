            I bought this Fuji digital camera several months ago because I decided I needed a digital camera.  I bought it at Sears, and when I took it out of the box, I wasn't terribly impressed.  I had previously used a Sony digital camera that was much sharper looking, with a larger digital screen.  But then I played around with the camera, and took some pictures of my dorm room and my feet, those sorts of things.  I transferred the images to my computer, and then my jaw dropped.  The digital screen wasn't even slightly indicative of the quality of the pictures.  The pictures I had taken had a great resolution, with sharp, clear images.  This was several hundred dollars cheaper than the Sony, and it had a much better resolution.  The camera is easy to operate, has a built-in flash, adjusts for short or long range photography.  

This is a great camera in consideration of its cost and durability.<br><br>
