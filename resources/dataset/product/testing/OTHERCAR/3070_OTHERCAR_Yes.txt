            I have a friend that has a car just like this.  I ride in it every week, and I think that it is the smoothest riding car I have ever been in.  It looks Great and is comfortable.  I am currently working on buying a car like this one because I love the way it drives and rides.  When driving this car, the steering was easy, and has great breaks.  The tires are great on these cars.  If you like a smooth driving, easy to fit in, and smooth riding car, this is the perfect car for you.  I think that anyone can drive this car.  <br><br>
