            At first glance this van appears to be a very nice minivan.  The Grand version has a lot of room in the trunk area. There are many cupholders and storage areas in this van.  The seats are very comfortable.  You have the option of putting the rear seat, in the second seat position.  The seats however, are extremely heavy and moving them around or removing them from the van becomes such a chore that it is almost not worth it.
  
Our transmission slipped on many occasions and it was brought back to the dealer countless time, only to have the problem diagnosed incorrectly.  Finally when the computer chip was replaced, the problem was solved.  
The repairs were warrantee'd but it was a nuisance.  
This transmission problem appears to be a problem in this particular model.<br><br>
