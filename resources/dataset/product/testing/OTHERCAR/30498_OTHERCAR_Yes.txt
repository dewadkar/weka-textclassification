            <b>Overview</b>
The people's car, the Volkswagen Beetle, gets a major jolt of go-power over the last "Turbonium" edition. Beetles come in all different flavors - the base 2.0L engine, the turbocharged 1.8L, a turbo-charged diesel engine, and now a special turbocharged 1.8L that puts out almost 200 hp! The Turbo S starts at $25K but is fairly full-equipped.

<b>What is the Turbo S?</b>
The Beetle Turbo S is VW's way of making the car a poor man's Porsche or Audi TT. They also want to make the Beetle a sporty contender in the sports coupe arena dominated by Celica's, Acura's, and the restyled Hyundai Tiburon. While VW does have its Golf GTI, the Beetle is a smartly styled car that is universally recognized. The Turbo S has some serious sports gear with a 6-speed transmission, upgraded 17" wheels, sports suspension and unique front and rear fascias.

When the Turbo S debuted last Fall, the reaction was underwhelming from the automotive press who preferred the new Acura RSX as an urban pocket rocket. Biggest on the complaint list was the Beetle's speed activiated spoiler and its odd interior proportions.

So, I just HAD to try this new Beetle as I'm looking to short list a few cars as my BMW 3-series approaches the end of its lease.

The Turbo S, at first glance, looks like any other Beetle. At second glance, you notice its unique wheels and its unqiue fog lamps. The front end looks less cute, more like an angry water beetle. The rear end has been slightly reshaped as well.

<b>Driving the Turbo S</b>
Driving a Turbo S, I was very impressed with the firm support from the Recaro-like seats. The car has a lot of nice touches, including brushed aluminum trim as well as a metal deadpedal lifted straight from an Audi TT. The much maligned rear spoiler was supposedly unbearably loud so I was pleasantly surprised to hear a quiet dull thud - much quieter than say, a power window going up and down - whenever the spoiler went up and down.

Overall, the Turbo S is beautifully appointed. Leather interior is standard as well as a more serious white on black dash. The interior does take some getting used to but it's a roomy place to be, defying the snug cockpit feel of other sports coupes.  The Beetle, by design is also a hatchback with all the practicality involved.  The rear seats are also roomy enough for people up to 5'9".

<b>Worth Getting a Turbo S?</b>
Well, yes and no. This is a nice car but is it worth the $5K upgrade over the other new Beetle model - the <b>Beetle Sport</b> which differs with the base 1.8L turbo and a 5-speed manual. Even with the different front and rear ends, most people would be hard-pressed to tell the difference. And the Beetle Sport is pretty peppy itself.  Any Beetle has its unique styling and its extremely good crash-test results (potential <b>PT Cruiser</b> buyers, check those crash tests and beware!)

Also, after studying Edmunds and other car reviews about the Beetle, it seems that Beetles built from 1998-2000 had build-quality problems. Since the Turbo S is in its first year on the road with its Audi TT-derived drivetrain, it might be safter to wait a year or two. But then, why not buy a used Audi TT?

The original mission of the Beetle was to be the 'people's car' - cheap and reliable transportation. With the Beetle Turbo S, we get the top of the line Beetle but when you're pushing past $25K, other cars beckon - even a Mercedes C230 Kompressor Coupe! The Beetle may be a very good car, but at that price, there are many others.

<b>Last Word about Small Car Trends</b>
The new Mini has a great ad campaign - "The SUV Backlash begins here." And after driving a Ford Explorer and even the smaller, saner Escape, I am seriously looking at smaller and smaller cars because, on average, I am the only person in my 4-door BMW 3-series. Only on weekends do I have a passenger or two. Every SUV I see on the road only has the driver, no passengers. So, if that's the case, why buy more car than you need?  As an urban citizen of Los Angeles, my next car might be a Beetle, Mini, the much anticipated BMW 1-series or the Mercedes C230. Something fun to drive, easy on gas and therefore easy on the environment.
