            I was shopping around for a new vehicle that was affordable and reliable. I never even considered the Hyundai, as I heard such horror stories about Hyundai vehicles.  As I was shopping around I poked my head into a Hyundai dealership just to see what they had to offer.  The first thing that struck me was how reasonably priced the Excel was. I then decided to test drive the Excel four door model and found the ride to be acceptable and it was pretty comfortable to boot!  I purchased the car on the spot and have been happy with it ever since!  I have put about 100,000 miles on it and have had no major mechanical problems with it.  My Hyundai has been nothing but a dependable vehicle.  I am proud to say that I have made family and friends happy Hyundai owners!

PS I must say that I would not recommend this car to a big or tall person as it lacks a roomy interior.
