            This car was my first car.  I bought it used in 1992 for $3500 and fell in love with it.

I remember loading my friends into it and going out for a night on the town.  I have so many memories in this car that it may bias my opinion.

Anyways - this car is what it is - a 4 door hatch with little or no amenities.  It came with a 92hp 4-banger, auto tranny and that's about it.  No air, no power BUT it did have relatively comfy seats.  It also had alot of interior room for a subcompact car. 

This would serve as a great first car (very safe) or as a winter beater for someone with a summer car (see my opinion on the '94 Mustang GT).
