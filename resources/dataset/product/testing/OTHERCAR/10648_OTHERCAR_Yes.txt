            In September, 1992, we bought a 1993 Dodge Caravan, base model and loved it.  We drove it to Florida in 1995 with four-year-old twins and a 2-year-old, and everyone was comfortable.  We got a wild hair the following year and sold it to buy a 1996 Dodge Intrepid.  Maybe we were trying to get one last hold on the youth that was quickly escaping us.  It was fun while it lasted, but while we absolutely <b>loved</b> our Intrepid, we decided to have another baby.  So our soon-to-be family of six needed a larger vehicle.  

We traded in the Intrepid and bought our 1998 Grand Voyager SE.  It was used as an Avis rental car and sold as what the dealership called a Program Car.  The color choices are very nice.  We got Deep Amethyst, which looks blue in certain light and purple in a different light.  The lighter colors do a nice job hiding dirt and rain spots.  

Our van has integrated child safety seats with five-point harnesses, which I love.  When my youngest starts to nod off, I have one of the kids recline the seat a little, and she can nap in comfort.  The rear seat has plenty of leg room, and two cup holders on either side.  The middle seat has two cup holders which slide out from under the middle of the seat.  The front has two cup holders that pop out on the sides when you pull out the tray (optional ash tray) that includes a coin holder. 

We still do a lot of driving on vacations, and our travels have just been boosted as we had to move over 800 miles from home due to a promotion and relocation.  We have plenty of room for everything we need to bring with us, and a cooler fits next to the middle seat on the passenger side.  Driver, passenger, middle and rear seats all recline for our comfort.  

The middle and rear seats also fold forward all the way.  We brought home a dining room table (unassembled in a <b>long</b> box) and six chairs in our minivan with ease.  The middle and rear seats are removable.  The rear seat can be placed in the middle position and has wheels to make this easier.

They offer a four cylinder engine as well as a 3.3 liter V6.  A dealer tried to tell us that many people find they don't need more than a four cylinder, but with the number of people and the extra weight of luggage when we travel, we decided to go with the V6.  Once the air conditioner is one, we are very glad we bought the V6!

We've really only had one problem with the van  The serpentine belt broke while we were away on vacation.  The service station near our hotel was great!  They took us right in and started work on it immediately.  When we heard it was going to take more than an hour, one of the workers took the kids and me back to the hotel in a Durango!  Evidently the tension wasn't right in the belt because it happened again about a month later.  The service station where we bought the van was also very quick and professional.  Obviously this was a fluke mishap and indicative of the quality of Chrysler's workmanship overall.

We have driven a Chevy Venture as a rental car, and I'll take my Chrylser over the Chevy any day! I have written a separate review on the Venture.<br><br>
