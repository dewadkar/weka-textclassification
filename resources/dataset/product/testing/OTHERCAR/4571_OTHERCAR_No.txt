            I absolutely love the way this car looks.  But it ends there.  The whole front end of this car is defective.  Shimmy, Shimmy.  Had to spend $3,500 to have everything aligned and replaced.  Lower control arms were replaced, three rims, two tires, complete alignment, new or refurbished brakes, etc.  I have only had the car 1-1/2 years.  There goes the great trade-in value.  Something is definitely wrong with the front end of this model, but Chrysler won't admit it.  Heard it was just the &quot;nature&quot; of the car.  There is a problem seeing out of the back of the car.  Could cause an unfortunate accident.  It is the way it was built.  The front end is too low, you have to watch out for the curbs.  Would not recommend buying this car.  Look for something more dependable.<br><br>
