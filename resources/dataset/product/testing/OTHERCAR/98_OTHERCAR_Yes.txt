            I have a Miata and I love it.  I drive it a lot, and I have the top down as much as possible.  I like the way it holds to the road, and just knowing it reads 140 on the speedometer gives me the sense of power...I like having the choice of convertible or hard top.  In the winter just slap the hard top on and when summer rolls around switch to the convertible.  They have great heaters on them in the winter, and you can even use the air conditioner when you have the top down to have a little cool air blowing on you.  The Miata is small but dependable.  All of my friends are envious of me when I come crusing through town with my little Miata with it's top down.  I have the wind blowing through my hair.  The Miata also gets good gas mileage.  I can go a week on ten dollars!  I love my Miata and wouldn't trade it for a thing.  One day I might grow up and turn 40, then I might consider driving a Lincon of some sort...<br><br>
