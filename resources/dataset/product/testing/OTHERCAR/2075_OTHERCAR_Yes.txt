            I bought my 2001 Jetta GLS TDI new in June 2000.   Since then, I've accumulated about 27,000 miles.  

This car is nothing short of wondrous. This is my second Jetta, the other being a '95 Jetta III (gasoline).  I though that car was great after putting 100K trouble-free miles on it and selling it for much more than half what I paid for it new.  However, the TDI is dream come true.

Forget that this is a diesel for now.  It doesn't act like one.  It doesn't smoke, stink, or rattle.  The only way you'd know it was a diesel would be to stand outside next to it while it's running.   Even then, it's remarkably quiet.   Step on the gas and run through the gears...you'll be at highway speed in short order.  This thing loves to park in the left lane and hunker down at about 85mph all day long (by the way, at about 3000rpm).  You can definitely tell it's a German car.   Don't let anyone convince you that all diesels are slugs without driving this car.  You may not take all cars off the line, but you'll catch up with them on the highway...and on the off chance you don't, you'll definitely pass them while they're filling up down the road.

Assuming your bladder doesn't rupture, you don't need to worry about stopping for fuel for about 650+ miles.  While you're cruising, tilt the sunroof and crank up the 200 watt Monsoon system with 8 speakers.  Simply unreal.

I've had only one problem with the car, albeit a somewhat critical one.  at about 22K miles, the power brake booster failed.  It was replaced under warranty (thank goodness I hadn't passed the crucial 24K mark).   Besides that, smooth sailing.   

Keep in mind that this is no regular diesel - VW has done their due diligence with electronics and other assorted engineering voodoo to make this a quick, clean, quiet car.  If your a salesman like me, drive a lot,  and get reimbursed for mileage, you've got it made.   Take a look at ebay...used examples are going for only a couple grand less than new - with 30K miles on the clock.  Great value retention.  In addition, there's lots of these things from the late 90's with 150K+ miles with little maintenance.  These TDI engines last forever - supposedly 250K miles is not a big deal.  I hope to test this claim...

I would buy it again and again and again. Do yourself a favor and drive one.
