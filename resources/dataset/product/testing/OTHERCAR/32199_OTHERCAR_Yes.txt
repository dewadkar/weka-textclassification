            When I decided it was time to purchase a new vehicle I had a few things to consider. One, I needed reliability, low maintenance and affordability. Two, we had recently found out we were expecting our first child. Cavalier was the first vehicle to come to mind. I had heard good things about it, and when I test drove it I was pleasantly surprised. It is a good size, small but relatively roomy and has nice lines. It's definately not a sports car, it lacks a little in pick up, but it leans toward a sporty look. I've had the car since January and have no problems what so ever. This is a good affordable family car.  <br><br>
