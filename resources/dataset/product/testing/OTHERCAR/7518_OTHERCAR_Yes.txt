            This car impressed me so much during the test drive that I bought right after I was done. Being 6'5&quot; I really can't find a car that fits me. The Stratus has room for me plus a few inches. 

This car can take a beating. I managed to get into two accidents so far with no problem to the car. Don't worry it wasn't the cars fault it was all me.

The only problem I seem to notice is that my Stratus is a gas eater. I normally get around 230 miles before I am filling up again. Then again that is all city driving.

This car is made for a family of four going to see Grandma 400 miles away. It's cozy and comfortable. You can't get a better car for this price.<br><br>
