            Ladies and gentlemen, i am very happy to be explaining how great of a cars toyota makes.  In my humble opinion this car is easily the best car on the market for its price. i have been driving the toyota supra for over 6 months now and let me tell you....i love it!  it drives smoothe and very comfortable.  Also, i can't get over how quiet this car is.  For example, in the midst of a thunderstorm, i could barely hear any raindrops hitting the top of my car.  There is plenty of leg room and the seats are extremely comfortable.  Without question i reccomend the toyota supra to everyone who's anyone.  this car is truly a great one and should be enjoyed by all. If you think i write a halfway decent reveiw and you agree with my opinions on products dont be afraid to give me an email at Prizice24@aol.com and also dont be afraid to check out my account and look at some of my other opinions. <br><br>
