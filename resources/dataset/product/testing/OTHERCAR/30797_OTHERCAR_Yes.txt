            After two months of use, I feel I can speak with a little authority about the D-340 R. The 1.3 megapixel resolution gives clear, crisp, and vivid pictures, that only begin to lose their image under intense zoom-ins. The camera's compact size allows it to be taken nearly anywhere, and the ease of use makes photography fun again for the point and shoot user. The camera works equally well indoors and outdoors, with good and accurate white balancing.  In addition, the photo editing software which comes with the camera is also very good and easy to use. The cameras appears to be built for durability and snaps, moving parts and other items seem to be built to last. The camera can be a bit of a battery eater at times, especially in cold weather.  I drained four AA batteries shooting and downloading 37 images.  The outside temperature during the photography was 22 degrees. The D-340 R, in my opinion, is an easy choice in this price range, offering more features and &quot;bang for the buck&quot; than the HP, Kodak, and other competitors.<br><br>
