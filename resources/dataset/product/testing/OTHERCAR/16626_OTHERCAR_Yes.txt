            I'm a 20-year-old college student that didn't want to invest the time into researching and repairing a used car. The accent was the perfect match for me. On the service side, I've had my accent for 9 months now and had only one problem with it. About a month ago, while driving home in traffic my transmission wasn't shifting correctly, but as soon as I restarted the car it was fine. The dealership changed a part for me (that was covered under the 10 year / 100,000 mile warranty), and I was going again in about 2 hours. 

As for the vehicle itself, let me describe the vehicle I purchased. I have a 2001 Accent GL with option package 3, basically fully loaded (CD player, power windows and doors, and automatic transmission). At 6'1", I have no problem fitting into the front seat by sliding the seat back, but with it back, people in my back seat can be a little cramped. For a smaller person, there probably wouldn't be a problem. The inside finish is comfortable; the car has all the basic items (clock, cup holders, etc.) 

Next, I operate the vehicle in rush hour traffic commuting to and from downtown everyday. I get about 30 mpg in normal everyday driving conditions, on my last long distance trip (800 miles) I traveled at about 70 mph and used about 36 mpg. The car is a little slow in acceleration, but in reading about other vehicles in the class I think it performs comparable if not better. The engine is quiet, esp. relative to other cars I've owned, and there is very little vibration even when driving at about 75 mph. 

Finally, the trunk space was larger than I had thought. There is ample space for moving moderately sized boxes and other items. Also, using the 60/40 fold down seat makes moving larger objects much easier. 

In conclusion, if you're single or not going to be moving around a lot of people or cargo most of the time, this is the car for you. The space is there to take 4 or 5 people, but this is a sub-compact, and for a long drive larger people are going to get uncomfortable. Also, I've moved some large items in this car, including a couch from Ikea (obviously unassembled), so if you need to move the space is there if you need it. If you're in the market, compare this car to its competitors and you'll realize, it's better in most categories especially price.
