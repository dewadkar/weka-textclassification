            It wasn't all that long ago that a person looking for a new set of wheels had two choices car or truck.
Generally, the decision was a lifestyle choice. Cars, more comfortable and more luxurious, were the obvious choice for people who simply had no need for a vehicle with a cargo bed.

Trucks, on the hand, were necessary for people in certain occupations, people who needed to tow things and people who simply had an active lifestyle that required them to haul a lot of awkward-sized gear around.

Then came the sport-utility vehicle, which became a huge hit on the basis that it could perform many duties of both a car and a truck. The only problem was that, underneath, SUVs actually were trucks and came with the same ride and handling handicaps that give heavy-duty vehicles their competence.

Now, we're into the highly fragmented crossover market.

One of the most interesting, and certainly the most inventive, is the Chevrolet Avalanche.

This is a highly stylized ( that's the polite way of saying people either love or hate the way it looks) Chevrolet Suburban sport-utility vehicle with the back end chopped away and replaced with a 5-foot, 3-inch pickup bed.

But that's only part of the story.

Behind the second row of seats, where the rear wall of the cabin would be, Chevrolet has installed a 25-inch by 53-inch piece of high-strength plastic which can be removed. The rear window can also be removed and stowed with the Midgate.

In addition, a crossbar that extends the width of the truck between the panel and the window can be folded forward with the Midgate.

Move all of that stuff out of the way, fold the rear seats forward and the Avalanche becomes a pickup truck with a bed that stretches to eight feet, one inch.

While all of this may sound complicated, the execution is rather simple. I performed the whole operation unassisted in a matter of minutes.

The only downside is that you'll need to tote the big stuff in good weather or risk getting wet.

There also are a couple of other clever ideas associated with this SUV. A rigid, three-piece interlocking and removable bed cover provides a secure cargo area when the tailgate is locked. On each side of the cargo bed are lockable compartments that can be used for additional storage or as ice chests.

Pickup truck lovers may wonder why Chevy went to all the trouble to make the Avalanche when a four-door Silverado could accomplish the same cargo mission with the passenger cabin intact at all times.

For one thing, the Avalanche, a big bruiser in its own right, actually is a couple of feet shorter than the crew-cab pickup.

The major difference, however, is in the way the two ride and handle. While the Silverado is reasonably comfortable for a truck, it can't compare with the Avalanche.

Since it has the underpinnings of the Suburban, the standard Avalanche is more stable in turns and more comfortable when the road is rough. And, because it had to be reinforced to accommodate the pickup bed, it is extremely tight and quiet. It is simply the best-driving pickup truck I've ever been in. 

Under the hood, a 5.3-liter, 285-horsepower engine, working with the four-speed automatic transmission, can easily handle the big hills and the tough terrain. If you're in a big hurry, you can get from a stop to 60 miles an hour in 8.3 seconds.

The EPA estimates the Avalanche will return 13 miles per gallon of regular unleaded fuel in the city and 17 on the highway. I averaged between 15 mpg in a week of varying driving conditions.

The four-wheel-drive system can be operated at the touch of three buttons one for two-wheel-drive, one for four-wheel-drive high range and one for four-wheel-drive low range.

The Avalanche has a payload capacity of 1,322 pounds and can tow trailers up to 8,100 pounds. Four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes are on call to bring the 5,678-pound truck to a halt.

I should point out that there also is a heavy-duty version of the Avalanche with an 8.1 liter, 340-horsepower V-8 engine and rear leaf springs, instead of the coils on the truck I drove. It can tow up to 12,000 pounds. Cadillac is also marketing its version of the vehicle, the Escalade EXT.

Inside, the Avalanche is capable of hauling up to six passengers when purchased with a front bench seat. The instrument panel is pretty much standard Chevy issue.

Base price of the vehicle I drove is $33,245. However, this was the North Face edition, developed with the company that sells outdoor gear, so the price jumps immediately by $3,500.

What you get is an off-road suspension package, 17-inch wheels, a locking rear differential, skid plates, an engine block heater, high capacity air filter, special leather trim, two back packs and two waterproof duffel bags. 

Other options were a sunroof, $1095; assist steps, $395; and a convenience package consisting of driver's-side self-dimming mirror and the OnStar emergency and communications system, $546.

Add the $720 delivery charge and the total comes to $39,501.

The Avalanche is an interesting departure from the traditional pickup truck. It really won't work for people who need cargo bed utility all the time, but it might just be right for the person wants a comfortable vehicle that occasionally will haul a lot of recreational equipment or make those trips back and forth to the lumberyard.
