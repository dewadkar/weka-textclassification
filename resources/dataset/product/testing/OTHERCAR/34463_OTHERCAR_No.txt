            This car gets great gas mileage and is great for commuting.  It has a very nice sized trunk for how small the car is.  I have a 4 door automatic. Now the size on the rest of the car stinks...DO NOT BUY THIS CAR FOR A FAMILY!!! It should only be used as a commuter car.  Lets put it this way I can easily sit in the drivers seat and unlock the rear passengers door and open it with ease and no straining, just a short reach.  Also i have a two year old daughter and because of it having airbags and using all the safety i was taught i only let her ride in the back seat, which is fine if it is just me and her riding in the car and makes in easier for me to reach her and check on her while driving. BUT she can not sit behind me and so the passenger in the front seat gets tortured during the whole trip because even if you put the front seat all the way up ((which means the passenger has very little leg room and is hopefully smaller say like a child)) they still get kicked the whole way...and not just because my kids a brat :) but because my daughter does not get any leg room either.  No happy medium. Also I forgot to add the seat has to go almost all the way forward because the kid will not even be able to fit into the carseat with out it partially forward. Also i find this car is too light. I live in an area that can sometimes have very strong wind gusts and it very easily pushes the car around.  I'm afraid that one day I am going to be pulled over due to swerving too much.  Another thing i dislike is that i HAVE to listen to music other wise the noises of the car drives me nuts.  All the squeeks and rattles and such makes me feel like one day i will be driving along and it will just fall apart. Yikes! I have used this car to do quite a bit of driving and i do have to say it isnt too uncomfy in the seats they actually are decent.
