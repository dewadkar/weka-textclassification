            I had a 1996 Passat on Lease and it was the first Zero defect car I have ever had. (I have never had a Japanese car, never will, even if it is made in the US, especially the US !) SO I decided to buy a Passat GLS. It was near the bottom of the line, just a sunroof. The main things I have done to the car that have transformed it performance and stylewise has been:
17" Porsche Style Wheels
CPU Chip
HID Headlights
The regular 150 HP Passat is a bit slow, the addition of a chip puts it up to about 190HP. At $400, this chip is excellent value. The reason is this: With a V6 you get power and the gas mileage of a V6. With a chip, if you want to drive "lightly", then you still get very good 4 cylinder mileage, if you want to merge on the highway or make someone say, "how fast was he/she going, what car was that", then you can have that too. It is like having your cake and eating it too, with a piece missing. If you like to blip the throttle to zoom across an intersection, then the V6 is your best choice, because there is turbo lag on the GLS, even with a chip. 
There are several chip makers, I won't go into which one is best here, but do some research. Keep in mind that the chip can (depending on your dealer) render you warranty invalid. That is why I bought an entire ECU (computer box) to house this chip. When I go in for service I drop the original box in.
YOU MUST KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS A LOW COST GERMAN CAR. The US market is one of, if not the cheapest place in the world to buy this car. You must realize before you make statements about it vs a Camry, that this car is made in Germany by assembly line workers that have often been apprentices AND the car has to be shipped over the Atlantic, whereas the Camry (for instance) is made by (possibly) former Taco Bell workers and is trucked in. The reason I mention this is because of the costs associated with selling this car. The Passat is priced at almost break even for VW, since they are targeting the Camry/Accord Market. DO you want a car made by a company that is obsessed with engineering and safety or cost control ? 
The Passat is being purchased by people who read Comsumer Reports rather than by someone who can't believe that a German car like this can be had for under 24K. There are little things that mean nothing to Germans and lend nothing to the performance of a car. Germans scoff at the importance Americans lend to cup holders and they are right. Cars are to be driven.
My car has been a zero defect car. There are some annoyances, though. The paint (dark anyway) is easily scratched. Swirl marks are almost immediate. The door where the window starts is a bit high, good for protection, but not for visibility. I often see women driving Passats and can only see their heads. Otherwise I can't say the car is lacking. I would have bought an Audi A4, because I really like Audis, but there is no back seat room, in my opinion.  This particular Passat is used as a taxi in Amsterdam, the back seat is generous.
Finally I want to like the new 2001 + Passat, but it is ugly. If considering a Passat you can probably get a good deal on the 2001 Passat.
