            My wife and I have had our Corrolla for a year and a half now and have had no problems. It is a reliable, inexpensive (to operate and purchase) automobile if not a little boring.

Don't expect too much power from this baby but you should expect a car that will run for 200,000+ miles with little maintenance to it.

I would buy this car again if given the chance, but I would go for a better stereo system (more speakers than 4) and wider/bigger tires to improve cornering.

Pros:
1. Cheap to buy, maintain, and put gas in
2. Nice styling for a small car - not all the plastic you see on comparable cars (Saturn, etc.)
3. Big trunk
4. Really, really dependable
5. Good cup holders (3 if you don't get a rear ash tray)

Cons:
1. Not too powerful (4 Cylinder) 
2. Doesn't corner tightly
3. black mirrors do not match car.
4. Automatic interior lights often do not turn on right away and you can't set this differently or turn it off. No manual way to control it.
5. Same thing is true for the headlights, you cannot turn them off when the car is running.
6. Hole between trunk and back seats could be bigger to allow more stuff to be put through there.<br><br>
