            First of all, a big inspiration for me to look into this camera was because it was featured in the 2002 summer blockbuster "xXx." I thought to myself, look at that cool camera, has a docking station, very small, in a movie, must be worth at least $500. Well, to my surprise, when I ended up buying it it was only about half that amount.

The camera itself is a spectacle. Simple, and very feature filled. Some of the most basic features are available and very well done; simple menu design, a good view finder (in case you don't want to waste the battery by using the LCD display), and one-touch picture uploads. Personally, I am a computer pro, but when I put this camera onto the dock, all I do is press a button to upload the pictures, no complicated software, wiring, etc. 

This camera is currently the smallest digital camera with a LCD display. It looks bigger in the pictures, but once I received it, I was surprised of the small design. The only upsetting feature is the lack of optical zoom. What's the use? Well with digital zoom, there are no moving parts, so the camera guesses the colors once it gets very close to an object, with optical zoom however, the moving parts actually make the picture clearer as they get closer.

The software that came along is very useful and creative as well. There are many simple editing features and touch ups. Also, the video recording with audio is surprisingly smooth and clear. However, one thing that you should consider is that video is usually darker than images because there is absolutely no flash when filming the full motion video. However, anyway you look at it, this is a great camera.
