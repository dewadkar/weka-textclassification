            I purchased my 1996 Honda Civic as a dealer demo car with 199 miles back in 1996 and have been thrilled with it ever since.  

It has plenty of room, gets great gas mileage and I have had to do no repairs except the normal oil changes, tune ups, and I just had the breaks done for the first time last month.  The only draw backs that I find with the car are the placement of the cd player (it is behind the lid of the cup holder, so if you have a drink in there you have to remove it to change the cd), and I think the seats could have been a little more comfortable.  After about two hours of driving my rear end and thighs begin to hurt, and they can use a little more back support.  

It is now over three years old, and still looks brand new.  Still no rattles, squeaks or other problems.  The Civic is just an all around well made vehicle!<br><br>
