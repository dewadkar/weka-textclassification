            Handling?  Please don't try this yourself.  This is only for professional fools like me.  You know those Interstate exit ramp speed limits that we all ignore?  I came across an unfamiliar one that read 25 mph and they really meant it.  Like a fool, I mistakenly entered around 55 mph and it was one of those extra tight killer circles.  As my life flashed before my eyes, along with all those deep grooves off the road and into the woods left by those before me that were also taken by surprise, with my heart desperately trying to make an early escape....around we went with hardly a squeal and shot out onto the main road. (watch that blind spot)

Now I decided to do the 25 mph down the road to were I was to meet my wife for lunch.  Of course I said, "Honey, guess what I just did?".  Thanks Cougar for saving my ...

I know your eyes are blurry from reading the numerous reviews on this car, so I won't go into all that performance data.  The V6 is quiet and performs great.  Any more performance and I would only get myself into trouble.  I like the way the car tracks perfectly on the highway with hardly no steering effort.  This makes long trips a breeze. 

The new Cougar?  Looks good.  Feels good.  Is good.  So after 2 years on the market, why do I see so few?  A bit about that later.  I'm not complaining because its fun to drive a unique car.  The style has remained the same.  Mine is over two years old and people still think its brand new.  Not bad.  

Prior to it's release, we fell in love with it at the local Auto Show.  The wife and I decided then, that if it drove as good as it looks, we would be buying one.  A month after they were released I took the test drive.  Wow, it has a stiff suspension.  Not your father's Cougar.  

My first surprise was the price, which up until this time had not been published.  I expected to pay about $4000 more for a car with so many options.  I liked it and bought the loaded, silver, V6 automatic with the rear wing the same day.  Some pleasant surprises were the heated mirrors, driver power seat, remote door and trunk locks, Euro style directional lights on the sides, 22 warning indicators, steel wheels, an air filter for people and the trip computer. The Cougar made a great replacement for my 1993 Mazda MX-6.  

I was thrilled at the timing of the new Cougar because the MX-6 and the Ford Probe were discontinued.  I tried, over the years, to get comfortable in each newly released Eclipse model, but couldn't. I was running out of front wheel drive choices for this type of car.
(The Cougar was purchased prior to the release of the 2000 Eclipse) 

I anticipated and expected some problems since it was the first of a new design.  29,000 miles and two years and 3 months later, the car has never returned to the dealer.  I have been notified and nagged by Ford to bring it in for an accelerator cable recall, but I'm still waiting for an additional reason to go through the trouble.  Of course if that cable sticks open on another exit ramp, I'll wish that I had.

<b>Important Reliability Update</b>
I have just passed the 3 year mark.  As a going out of warranty treat for my Cougar, I brought it to the dealership for the first time to have 4 recall fixes installed.  I did not experience any of these recall symptoms prior.  I still had absolutely nothing else for them to attend to.

Many have complained about the size of the rear seats but the Cougar has more room than the MX-6, the Probe and of course, everything has more room than the Eclipse.  They made the rear bucket seats deep to the floor boards, to increase head room.  This is not a family car because child restraints would not mount well to the seat design, although a couple of children that are beyond child seats would love it.  But on the other hand, there is some comfort to be had for a couple of average sized adults and it is not cruel to put them back there for short trips.  

Instrument and control knob/button ergonomics are excellent.  The entire instrument cluster is the exact shape of the steering wheel and all indicators within the cluster are visible through the arc of the wheel.  The only place on the dashboard where there are no controls is where the edges of the wheel would block your view. Very well thought out.  Every single control is visible by moving only your eyes, all the way down to the back lit trunk release near your left foot.  The three dashboard air vents are uniquely circular and highly functional.

There is a nasty blind spot that could kill you on an entrance ramp to the Interstate.  The side view mirrors were designed with looks in mind rather than functionality.  Because of its shape, there is a missing area of mirror surface.  I quickly fixed the problem with a $1.99 optical stick on mirror from K-mart applied to the drivers side view mirror.  If a vehicle is visible in the optical, don't move left. 

My garage has a slight incline to it and occasionally the coolant indicator came on.  Although the coolant was correctly on the line, without giving it much thought, I added an additional inch of coolant and I have never seen the warning again.  Now I just learned that others had the same problem.

Driving on snow takes some extra concentration even though it is front wheel drive.  At least mine does.  I don't have the traction control option.  Although I don't feel it will get stuck in the snow, it does not take much speed for the whole car to move a bit to the left or to the right until you slow down a bit.  I believe the extra wide tires have a lot to do with it.

Why so few Cougars?  It seems Mercury made a marketing error.  Their target is the young who they feel will buy a Cougar and then graduate to the Grand Marquis (yuk) or some of their other large cars.  Many of the young adults are driving used cars or find the Cougar pricey.  A bit older, oops! they have the toddlers. (see rear seat above)  Of the few Cougars I see, many are being driven by the over forty crowd, like me.  We grew up with those pony cars, refuse to act our age, and enjoy driving this type of car.  We feel that radar detection should be on the list of standard equipment.  We use front seats over 98% of the time and sometimes wish the rear seats were invisible.  Some of us have teenagers that won't be caught dead with their parents anymore or they can be persuaded to jump in the back if they really want to be dropped off at the mall.  And then others, like I, well the kids have moved out altogether.   

Previous owners of the larger model Cougars are walking into the showrooms, get drawn over to the new Cougar, and say, "Hey, why not?"  The Lincoln couple walk in and the wife will say, "This would be a great second car for me."  I only wonder what would happen if Mercury had decided to target the over 40 crowd.

We like this Cougar so much that we came close to having two of them at the same time.  A sales representative, with little foresight, turned down the lease deal we were looking for.  Unfortunately, we went and leased a different car elsewhere and the very next month Mercury had the type of deal we would have wanted.
