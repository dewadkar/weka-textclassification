            We purchased our Chrysler Concorde because we were looking for a mid-size with some style and the Concorde seemed to fit the bill.

We love the stylish body of the Concorde and the interior comfort.  The ride is extremely comfortable and the seats are very comfortable.  However, that is all that can be said on a kind note about this car.

We hate that the car has been in the shop for numerous repairs, ranging from steering rack problems, water pump corrosion, battery explosion not to mention that we are currently waiting to find out why there is little or no compression in all six cylinders.

We would suggest that anyone purchasing a Chrysler product also purchase the extended warranty because, in our opinion, the vehicles are just not made to last past 3 years even under normal driving conditions.
