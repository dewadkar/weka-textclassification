            Once upon a time I would only buy Fords, having owned no less than three Escorts since passing my driving test!!!  Until that is, I was persuaded to move over to the VW camp and try a Golf.  That was seven months ago and it is quite simply the best car I have ever owned. 

Being a skint recent graduate, the best I could do was a '92 Mk2 Golf 
(Mk 1 to you American viewers because what we called the Mk 1 Golf in Europe from 1974 - 83, you guys called the Rabbit).  

The Mk2 was introduced in 1984, and was simply an enlarged version of the Giuigaro styled Mk 1.  So all the old styling features remained: the fat C-pillar, the round headlamps, and the Beetle-style door handles.  The best versions were the GTI 16v launched in 1986, and the supercharged four-wheel drive G60 Rallye of 1989.

As far as my own car is concerned I shelled out ï¿½2500 (about $5000) for what was an eight year old car.  Not a problem as the Golf's amazing build quality meant that it was equivalent to say a four year old Ford or Opel.  No rust anywhere.  Not a single squeak from the dash.  The seats and carpets don't even show any sign of wear.  The guys from Wolfsburg sure know how to strap a car together.

My car is a '92 1.8 Driver, probably one of the very last Mk 2's ever built.  It is metallic black, and is the run-out version of the Driver model (the official GTI lookalike, essentially a GTI without the &quot;I&quot;).  So mines came with the rev counter and Mk3 style upholstery that the majority of earlier, pre '91 Drivers don't have.  Mines also has the rare carburetted version of the GTI's potent 1781cc engine.  Still, that's good for 90bhp, and is fast enough for everyday driving.  

Handling is a revelation, and this old car can still mix it with the very best of today's machinery.  Honestly.  The turn-in in pin sharp, and the Golf can fly round corners at 55 - 60mph like it's on rails.  This is one of the reasons why the Mk 2 Golf is considered to be the best all round version.  The Mk 3 and Mk 4 are too soft, too expensive and bloated to be held in the same regard.

The engine is great as well, the mid range power is superb, and will rev quite happily into the red line (6500rpm) without feeling as though Hiroshima is about to occur under the bonnet (like my old Escort).  THe gearchange is chunky and smooth, and moves with a mechanical precision that could only be German.  The engine compartment is superbly laid out, so it is a snap to work on when doing maintenance.

Gripes?  Well, the black and gloomy interior is a well-known Mk 2 Golf problem, as is the tiny luggage compartment which is not very versatile.  The location of the fuel tank means that the spare wheel encroaches into the trunk, which is no good at all.  The door catches start to stick if you don't lubricate them regularly, and here in Scotland, cold weather does take its toll on these twiddly items.

Spare parts are expensive, but to be honest, you won't need many.

But on the whole these are superb cars and I'd recommend them to anyone who needs a car which is fun to drive, durable and classy.<br><br>
