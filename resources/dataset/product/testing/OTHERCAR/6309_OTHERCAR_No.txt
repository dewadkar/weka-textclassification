            We used to have a '96 Avenger base model. It was a blue-purple color , very nice . My husband immediatly fell in love with it due to it's sporty looks. I liked it alot up until we started having problems with it . We had the car about 3 months and it started stalling on us . A few times we came close to having an accident due to that problem! It didn't do this all the time , so of course when we brought it in to the shop to get it checked out, it was running just fine. All the mechanic would do is turn up the idle and send us back home! After not even 2 years it had an oil leak , turns out the headgasket was blown!!!While the car was still in the shop ,we decided to trade the car in before anything else would go wrong with it because it still stalled on us occasionally and they couldn't find anything wrong with it . We traded it in and 4 weeks after that we drove by the shop and the car was still up on the hoist getting fixed! So that was the biggest problem we had with the car , other then that i have to say that it's very comfortable ( we drove all the way from Louisiana to Minnesota and back in it and it was nice). It handles very well on the road (if it doesn't stall out on ya)  and even though it's a 2-door it's very roomy inside! <br><br>
