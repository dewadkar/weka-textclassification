            <B>That's right.</B>  The title says "You might not ever get rich."*
But buying used cars instead of new gives you a chance.
I assume you've all seen the charts that show the long
term difference in your finances between buying new and
used cars.  You factor in fast depreciation on the new
car, the higher price (for the same model), and the 
possibility that you might be able to swing cash only
on the used but need a loan for the new.  <B>Cha-ching!</B>
Dollars are leaving your wallet just reading this.  Oh,
one more thing.  The difference in cost between the new
and used car could be earning $$ for you if you invest
it.  Buying the more expensive new car costs you some-
thing in missed opportunities.

<B>But </B>enough on why I buy used cars, stuffing the difference
in cash into my investments.  What about the Mercedes 190E?
When we buy a car in our family, we sift through Consumer
Reports and other auto rags for repair, reliability, and
comfort data on models which interest us.  I wanted a small,
zippy, very safe car.  Fortunately, my husband works with a
former employee of the Insurance Institute where they crash
cars (seen on Dateline now and then).  We asked him for
recommendations and he came up with 2:  Mercedes 190E and
Subaru Legacy.  We added in a Nissan or Toyota similar to
the Legacy.  We checked the data on all 3 and picked the
best years.  Some car years are drastically better in 
reliability than others.

<B>Shopping </B>begins.  Car shopping can be a pain.  We ran into
the classic sleazy used car dealer at one lot.  He advertised
a Legacy with automatic transmission (I gave up manual when
I started juggling tippy cups in the car).  I got into the
Legacy and asked him what the third pedal was for.  He 
argued with me for 2 minutes that the car was an automatic.
We left.  My husband was dead set on getting the Subaru.
He kept saying that Mercedes would cost too much.  He chased
Subarus through the ads week after week but they were 
always sold before we got there.  I came to the conclusion 
that because it was a "hot" used car, dealers were 
advertising them even when they didn't have any, just to 
increase traffic to their lots.

<B>Finally,</B> I told my husband that I saw myself in a royal 
blue 190E.  We had seen a couple 190's at a crummy lot and
they were overpriced, so he wasn't convinced.  Then we found 
Chuck Benton's ad.  He does the used car buying for our big
Mercedes dealer in town.  When the dealership takes in
cars that they don't want on their used lot, Benton buys
the best of the bunch for his own small dealership.  He
fixes them up and sells them.  The rest go to auction.

<B>This </B>guy knows Mercedes cars.  We called him and he said 
he had 2 cars that he'd sell a woman who is driving small
children.  Some cars he described as "projects" which are
more appropriate for gear heads.  One of the cars he said
he'd sell us was a royal blue grey/black interior 1985 190E.
We zoomed over to his lot.  I looked at all the cars he had
in his tiny basement garage.  He said he was serious and
really wouldn't sell certain cars to a woman driving small
children.  What a refreshing change in sales policy from
some of the places we'd been to!

<B>Love</B> at first drive is possible.  This car was so smooth,
so quiet.  It handled like a sports car.  The interior was
easy to clean kid debris from (Mercedes version of vinyl/
leather).  And I felt like royalty driving it.

<B>Why</B> did I feel better in a Mercedes?  My husband and I
discussed it.  Were we caught in a status trap?  If any of
you knew us, you'd find that laughable.  After all, I've
driven a Geo Metro and Renault Alliance.  Not really 
status cars, are they?  But we had to ask ourselves.  We
decided we just liked the luxury.  We'd never had a car
with buttons before and this one had plenty.   It was in
cherry condition, previously owned by a stewardess who 
took the bus to the airport.  Her brother drove it and
blew the engine so she traded it.  Benton put a new engine
in so at 85,000 miles, it had zero on the engine.  One
$6000 check later and I was cruising!

<B>This</B> 190E was comparable to one Legacy we saw and liked.
Interestingly enough, the Legacy was $2000 more than the
190E.  And it didn't have a new engine.

<B>Features of this car include:</B>

<B>o </B>2.3 liter engine - there is a more powerful 190 but 
this works fine on the hills and mountains around here

<B>o </B>Anti lock brakes

<B>o </B>Driver airbag

<B>o </B>Sliding sun roof

<B>o </B>Air conditioning

<B>o </B>Net bags in rear for kiddo stash

<B>o </B>Builtin first aid kit

<B>o </B>Rear armrest and map light

<B>o </B>Power seat adjustment, lumbar support & heated seats, 
power windows

<B>o </B>Valet key - doesn't work on the trunk or glove compartment

<B>o </B>This model has the California emission control which
was more stringent than the rest of the country's standard

<B>Service</B> on this car has been routine only with one small
weird electrical problem.  This car is so reliable, I would
forget to do the routine maintenance if my husband didn't
remind me.  One thing I would change is the defrost.  It
really blows right at my eyes and has only one speed - full
blast.  I'd like to be able to run a low defrost during 
Northwest misting season.  I keep Michelin all season 
Luxury Touring tires on my baby.  They seem to handle our 
rainy season well.

<B>Bottom line</B> on this car is that it doesn't matter if you're 
rich or not.  Driving this baby makes you feel like you are.
At least it does for my husband and me.  If you want to
save some $$, check out used cars and give some a spin.
See you at the car wash!  Oh, and while you're there, 
check out my husband in his "new" 1995 Subaru Legacy.  
He ended up getting one for himself.


<B>Update:</B>
<B>Oops, </B>forgot to mention - I bought the car 4 years ago
and have put 40,000 miles on it.

*<B>Rose Royce's</B> first recorded album, <B>"Car Wash", </B> went Platinum:
<I>
You might not ever get rich.
But let me tell you it's better than digging a ditch.
There ain't no tellin' who you might meet.
A movie star, maybe even an Indian Chief.
Workin' at the Car Wash.
Workin' at the car wash, yeah!
Come on and sing it with me.
Car Wash.
Sing it with feelin', y'all!
Car Wash, yeah!
