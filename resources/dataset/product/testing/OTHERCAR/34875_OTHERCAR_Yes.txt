            About a month after we got our new Odyssey, my wife paused at the garage and said, �Let�s take your Catera tonight. It never gets to go anywhere these days.�

Yes, the Odyssey is that much fun.

I�m used to driving nice cars. Before the Catera (see my review here before you buy one!), I drove a Saab 9000 Aero limited edition; a couple of Saab 900 Turbos preceded that. And I must say that for comfort, stability and passenger fun, the Odyssey is a class act.

Far more surprisingly, it�s even more fun to drive than the Catera. While it�s no sportster, neither is the baby Caddy, and this van�s 200+ hp engine is torqued just right for peppy, responsive freeway driving. Add that to the solid suspension and careful engineering, and the result is a ride that will surprise many a car snob like me.

One measure of its powerplant is the quiet way it accelerates. While my Catera revs up like a coffee grinder when I place any demand for acceleration, the Odyssey replies with smooth understatement.

Visibility is likewise superb. I always thought Saab must have learned something special about cockpit visibility from its aircraft manufacturing experience. Until now, no other car has come close to the near-360 viewscape I came to expect from the Saabs. This van fills the bill -- probably an under-appreciated safety feature, when you think about it: the best way to survive an accident, after all, is to see it coming and avoid it.

I don�t need to elaborate on the many pleasing features you�ve already read about here: the marvelous rear hideaway seat, the separate front/rear air conditioning unit and controls, the fine sound from a quality CD stereo system. They�re all there, along with the Honda precision and quality that makes them such dependable and, ultimately, lovable cars.

We�re planning a long trip to Arizona this spring for some Cactus League baseball. And it looks like the Caddy will be getting lonesome here in the garage while we�re gone.
