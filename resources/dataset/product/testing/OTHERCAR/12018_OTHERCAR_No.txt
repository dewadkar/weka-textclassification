            The 2000 S2000 is a pure sportscar. There is no other car that matches its engine output of 120 horsepower per litre, except for the new Ferrari Modena 360. It comes close, but it also has 4 more cylinders to play with. Handling is another matter. Honda wrote the textbook on design with this suspension setup. Moving the engine as far rear as possible made the cars weight distribution perfect- a 50/50 split. Why does the engine seem to rev until infinity? Honda went to its F1 race engineers and let them have at the engine design. Small stroke and small bore contribute to the 8900RPM redline. VTEC switches on both the intake and now the exhaust also help the engine breath what it needs to take the car to new heights. Honda also employed VTEC operation even while the car is in neutral- a first for Honda VTEC systems. The system also helps this car attain great fuel mileage, ranging from 17 to 25 mpg. Is this car reliable? Yes. How do I know? Being a Honda Technician, the design layout is very similar to its other models. All of its components are new, but they come from the same suppliers and are known for their reliability. This is also the first rear wheel drive Honda, along with the first production engine that Honda has designed that now turns clockwise instead if counterclockwise. For $32,000, you get a very well equipped car. Gem of an engine, very crisp 6 speed manual transmission, and of course the ability to let the wind go through your hair. Ever wanted to drive a F1 race car? This is close, but without having to spend $150,000 on a Ferrari. The 6 speed transmission in this car is one of the best. Shifts are close and extremely crisp, and the clutch operation is firm but easy on the left foot. The nifty little feature that locks out reverse while the car is moving is a great safety feature that prevents 5th to reverse shifting. Driving. The first time you mash the throttle until redline, your hooked. The car screams like no other, and the new electronic tach. and speedometer add to the millenium element of the car. This car is not for just anyone. This car is for people that like pure sports cars. It only has 240 horsepower, but what 4 cylinder engine comes even close to that output without turbo's, supercharger's, or with some other cheater device? The car is also designed for handling. Drag racers won't really appreciate this car, but putting this car through its paces on a road course is awesome. The car is very stable at all speeds, and in turns rolls very little to provide stability. The car is very predictable and has very little understeer. Oversteer is easily controlled with the throttle. If you want a car just for its engine, this is the one to buy. If you want a car for its transmission, this is the car to buy. If you want a car for its reliability, this is the one to buy. Every aspect of this car is nearly perfect. The only bad thing about it is its availability. Only 5,000 will visit the U.S. this year. People who own Honda automobiles know one thing. Honda is an engine company that just happens to also build cars too. Honda's S2000 is one of the best sports cars designed. Honda gives a clinic on car design with this one. If you want one of the best sports cars on the planet, buy this one.<br><br>
