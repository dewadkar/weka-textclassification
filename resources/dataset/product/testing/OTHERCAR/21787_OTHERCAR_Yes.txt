            We bought a new civic in april 1997. So far this has been an amazing car. It's built solid and gets great gas mileage too. Ours is red and it still looks new almost 3 years later. Honda is known for it's quality, and the Civic EX is the best example of an affordable car built well. Our next car will be a Honda. Their customer service to top notch too. We had uneven tire wear on our civic, but after a week Honda representatives in Atlanta
said they would pay half to replace all 4 tires (the car had 26,000 miles at this point). My advice, always have it serviced at the honda dealer until the warranty expires, that way you know only honda has touched your car and if you have any problems, they have all the paperwork that shows you did your part...

Update Jan. 2002. 

Ok, we still have the car and it runs great, but we had to replace the a/c 6 months ago (550.00)

The side view mirrors do not operate correctly, they keep moving even after we stop hitting the switch.

The drivers door squeaks at 2000 rpm, and the hatchback also squeaks time to time.

Body integrity is good and the paint still looks showroom new.

Interior is like new and the moonroof does NOT leak at all, although others warned us it would...but not yet...

Overall, it's still a solid car, not happy about the a/c failing or the noise in the drivers door that no one can seem to fix...it has 70,000 miles and will probably go another 50,000 easy...

Road noise is also a problem at high speeds..Honda could have done a better job protecting the a/c condenser from leaves which caused ours to fail...And those "boots" that go on front wheel drive cars, why do they always crack and cost 350 to replace???
