            The Mrs. and I were looking very closely at the Altima, but for some reason couldn't get our heads around it.  We have a toddler and another on the way and needed enough room for 2 carseats (one rear-facing) with comfort and legroom for those in front of the babies. I wanted an Accord, but it just wasn't going to be big enough for us in the long run.
 
Huh? A Cr-V? Nah, its too small...
 
WRONGO! Its got enough room for both of us plus our 2 year old and a TON of groceries. Our requisites were:
At least 25 mpg combined, 15"-16" tires (no 17-20s - they're expensive!), enough room for a read facing seat with room, good ride, nimble handling, enough pickup (old car necessitated shutting off the A/C to get on the Hwy),
good resale and reliability.  
 
I currently have a 93 civic with 160k that is like new. so honda is proven with us. Considering we couldn't FIND a used one for much less than a new one, I thought that the CR-V's resale value would hold up fine. On paper it is  PERFECT.
 
But what about driving it?  Well, It is FUN, quick, (hills, onramps and merging is enjoyable) and it doesn't u-turn....it PIVOTS!!! 2 Lane U-turns are a breeze. It handles well, gets decent gas mileage and my wife loves it.
I expect that the economy will improve as the engine breaks in (its got 1500 miles on it), but we are seing 22 combined as we speak.  
 
The more I drive it, the more I don't want to stop!  I really, really like this thing.  The Mrs. was sold at the get go, it too me a few weeks to warm up, and now I am sold COmpletely!  Everything from the reclining and tumble
seats, to the fold down console to the cubbies and storage everywhere.  This thing is fabulous at [nearly] all things.
