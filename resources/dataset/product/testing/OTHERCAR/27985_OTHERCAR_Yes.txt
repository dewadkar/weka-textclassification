            I've always known that Toyota's were dependable automobiles, however since I've driven a Tacoma I've been amazed.  After owning it for six months I haven't had one problem.  I would also recommend this truck for its interior comfort, I have the bucket seats in mine and they are very comfortable.  With the TRD off-road package the Tacoma also has great suspension if you ever need to go off-road and you get the rear locking differential which can be very helpful if you're ever stuck or in a bind.  The xtracab is also nice because it  makes for plenty of cargo room and you get more interior room and an added two seats in the back.  I would highly recommend this vehicle if you're in the market for a reliable, reasonably priced mid-sized truck.  <br><br>
