            <B>Crisis! Shock and Disbelief!</B> Our 1988 Toyota Camry has bit the cosmic dust. Shuffled off its mortal coil. Gone to the Great Beyond. Slipped the Surly Bonds of Earth. 

In other words, our battered but trusty (or so we thought) "good" car failed to pass its annual NY State inspection this week. Not only failed: <B>Failed-with-a -capital-F</B>, to the tune of a couple of thousand bucks just to get it to pass the inspection and make it road-worthy. This is upstate New York; salt, rust, time, huge hills, and life's vagaries all take their toll on our cars, and the Toyota had served us well these many years. This particular one has seen us through divorces & remarriage, 13 winters, 4 learning-to-drive teenagers, and countless happy cruising hours. It played a discreet role in the falling-in-love of me and my husband. It rescued me from utter immobility when I was injured and unable to drive my standard-shift Volvo. It has brought home thousands of plants for my garden, taken us uncomplainingly on camping trips and to music festivals, borne our 2 kayaks on its handsome roof, and shuffled 2 kids and all their stuff to & from college. And now, poor dear, its day is done, after only 114,000 miles. (You know Toyotas in the Northeast - the engines would gladly keep on going, but the mortal flesh, the flimsy body, gives out.)

OK, so much for the eulogy...time for a new car. We're loyal to Toyotas, we <i>love</i> Toyotas, so that's where we started looking. We don't need a big car any more, at least most of the time, and money is a big factor (cars, like people, go when you least expect it and often before what we mere mortals consider their due time). We want good fuel efficiency. We need more comfort for our afflicted backs and bottoms than we did when we were 20 years old. My husband, that troublemaker, is a bit over 6'6"; I am short with cranky joints. I don't want a stodgy-looking car; I'm a middle-aged chick who no longer has to shuffle kids and their stuff, and I want to look lively when I hit the road.

So...we thought we'd check out the Echo. Consumer Reports (the Given Word on all purchases, major and minor) rated it highly. I like the way it looks (although my children informed me that it's ugly, I think it's kinda cute), one was available on the local lot, and the price and fuel mileage were right. Took it out for a drive, and here's what we thought:

1) The seat is high up, more like a minivan or pickup; you perch way up there, with a good view of the road. I like that; my husband didn't. (Of course, at his height he has no trouble seeing the road - he's always way up there...) The seats are also "firm" - you sit on top of them, and bounce around some, rather than sink down in to be cradled in luxury. This didn't bother me, but then again, I'm not the one with the hemorrhoids. I don't know how well this would wear on a long trip (we're planning to drive 3,000 miles this summer, so the thought is high in our minds). I was comfortable enough - in fact, for my particular back/hip/leg problems, this was an improvement on the Camry - but my husband was "concerned". And, consistent with its higher-upness, it is a lot easier for me to get in & out of than lots of other cars (the Corolla, which we also tested, for instance). Think of me as your crazy little old auntie - my back hurts, my hips hurt, I don't bend that easily, and I hate to flop around like a dying trout trying to get in & out of a car.

Oh, and don't let me forget about the center-of-the-dashboard speedometer & "instrument panel"; this is the feature people always talk about with this car, as if it were something really radical. I don't know why, but I didn't find this disconcerting at all - seemed logical to me, and with my bifocals (boy, I really do sound like a little old auntie!) it is actually much easier to read. Kinda started me wondering why more cars don't put it there. I like it.

2) For a midgety kind of car, there was surprisingly good head room, even for the Tall Domed One. Not an issue for me, and adequate for him. More leg room in front than you might expect, too - again, not an issue for me, and my husband was less-than-perfectly comfortable, although it was much better than many cars he's been in. Okay, he thought, not great. The seat depth was great for me, but didn't give enough support for his long legs.

3) The "drive", as they say, is sort of lively. The engine (automatic transmission) seems to me to jump up & down through its various gear ratios a lot, revving up & down much more prominently than I'm accustomed to in the Camry. Husband says this is because of its smaller (shorter?) "gear ratio"; I don't know if that's true or if he's just talking big, but the best word I can come up with for the feel of driving it is "jumpy". Now, that can be either a good thing or a bad thing: to me, it seemed lively and kind of sporty, to him it "made him nervous". And it's unquestionably noisier than we are used to - not in a bad way, I thought, but I definitely was aware of all the engines adjustments as we went up hills and speeded up. A feature of the Echo is that when you turn sharply or quickly, it feels like it's rolling, although Consumer Reports assures us that it doesn't actually tip over.

4) The "ride" is what I would call "bouncy". Dear Husband called it uncomfortable. I wouldn't go that far - in fact, I thought it was sort of fun, but it definitely didn't have the smooth feel of the old Dearly Departed Camry.

5) The back seat - well, let's not go there! I mean that literally. Actually, it might not be bad for small kids; I had no problem at all sitting behind the passenger seat, and could manage behind the driver's seat even with Daddy Long-Legs up there in his full pushed-back position. I can't imagine that 3 people, even kids, could be too comfy back there, but it would probably do for 2 children who behave themselves appropriately in cars (the only kind I would have in my back seat in any case, since I won't tolerate ill-behaved kids fighting or whining in the back). Still, it's not very cushy back there - I wouldn't want to ride there for long. Fortunately, that's not much of a concern for us now. Adequate headroom in back, too, even for Tall Boy.

6) The back seatbacks fold down (pretty easily too) to make a pretty good long carrying space from the roomy trunk. You could fit the cross-country skis in there, for sure.

7) Love the trunk! Because this car sits high up off the ground, and its funny little rear end kind of bobs up, the trunk is pretty tall, and it goes back a good ways. Consumer Reports says you can fit 4 suitcases & an overnight bag in there - I dunno, but it looked to me like you could fit more than you'd think in it. And here's what I really loved: because it's higher off the ground, and because there's not a mess of tailfins or anything sticking out behind, it seems like it would be much easier than most cars I'm familiar with for getting stuff in & out. Save the back!

8) Great fuel mileage on the Echo! Supposedly about 39 mpg - can't argue with that. But perhaps part of the reason is that this is a lightweight car, with the drawbacks & advantages that that entails.

I am not a "features" junkie; I'm not too sure what "features" are exactly when it comes to cars - mostly I just want my car to drive reliably and safely, to have air conditioning & heat that work, wipers that wipe, windows & doors that you can open & close, and the right number of wheels and mirrors and headlights & stuff. Not a techno-girl, I know. The Echo has regular old roll-up windows, not those dreaded mystery devices controlled by the driver that only will work when the engine is running, regular old door locks, and you adjust the side-view mirrors manually from inside the car. I actually prefer all these things. Barely-adequate cup-holders, but you can never really tell about those things till you & the car have been on a few trips together; you have to sort of come to a mutual accommodation on that sort of thing. There are lots of little cubby-holes and storage bins inside, which seemed kind of cool but I wonder how handy they really would be. Oh, it also has a CD player as well as the usual radio/tape player - I was sorry to let that "feature" go as we moved on in our car quest.

<B>The verdict</B>: we didn't buy the Echo, despite Consumer Reports' favorable, even enthusiastic, reviews. I probably would have, if it were just up to me, but my husband's concerns prevailed on this one. I would recommend it, though, for a young family, single folks, kids lucky enough to take a car off to college, or almost anybody shorter than my beloved husband. Although this model is so new that long-term reliability and safety records aren't yet available for it, it seems hard to beat for the price, the Toyota "brand name", and the gas mileage. Ande I <i>still</i> think it's awfully cute!
