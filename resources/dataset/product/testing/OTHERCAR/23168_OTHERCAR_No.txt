            I would have to say I am disappointed at Dodge with this 1995 1500 model Dodge Ram.  We bought this truck used, with about 15000 miles on it, and have put about another 30K more miles on it, and its a money pit.  

We purchased the truck with after market shocks (which make the truck ride 2 feet higher then all the other Dodge Rams of this series which is nice) We also received after market tint job on the windows, and after market Alpine stereo, we also installed an after market muffler system, which makes the truck sounds like its growling.  So with all the after market stuff excluded from my review here I go...

The truck, like all other trucks is <b> BIG </b> and with bigness comes problems.  The truck, if driven like a car, get 8 miles per gallon, and on long hauls you can easily fill up the tank twice. The tank, however, is nice and large for this reason.  It holds 20 gallons, and costs $30 per fill up.

Other problems include recalls, recalls, and more recalls.  (Five in all)You have to wonder what the engineers were thinking when they didn't include the little clip that would keep the steering column together, or the switch that allows you to raise and lower your power windows. Also we had to replace the trasmition on the truck because it would roll backwards, stall, and grind, or not even engage correctly, also the 4 wheel drive was causing us problems, so we just replaced it.

On the topic of 4 wheel drive, this thing is a beast.  When engaged, this truck can traverse anything and everything.  Its a little awkward in the snow, just because of its sheer size, its difficult to stop.  

We also just replaced all four giant tires for $125 each. We also have problems with the ball bearings in the wheels, and the breaks also go very quickly.

On the subject of towing and hauling, we've done both.  We've moved my two brothers into college, and into their new houses with this truck.  The back bed hold a lot of stuff.  We've moved all kinds of interesting stuff from beer refrigerators to twin size beds to bookcases in this truck.  We've also toed U-Hauls when we couldn't fit all the stuff in the back.  And when the back isn't in use, we cover the bed with a nice after market leather cover to increase fuel efficiency.

All the downsides aside, this truck is nice to drive.  Riding high in the big red machine, you feel that you rule the road.  With the big engine growling like an angry dog, you feel in command.  Its a nice truck overall, nice layout of the controls, heating, air conditioning, and lights.  The back bench isn't comfortable in long hauls, but the front two captains chairs are nice and comfortable.  Its a nice truck overall, and I enjoy driving it.
