            I bought this car because my father-in-law heard good things about the camry I bought the camry 2dr coupe V6 Le with everything in it.it has moonroof, AC,Spoiler,Cd and cassette radio, ABS brakes,leather, like i said be fore 6 cylinder and it is power everything.it was the most expensive price i would ever pay for a car,And i absolutely love it. this car has brought me such good luck. it is so roomy it drives so smoothly. recently i had got in to an accident because of icey conditions and i hit a tree. well my car did not have that much damage to it at all. and i did not get hurt at all. this car is very inexpensive to fix. which that is great feature. above all i would recommend this car to anyone. this car is good for families and people who like the sporty kind of car because you can do anything to it.<br><br>
