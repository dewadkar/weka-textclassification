            The 2001 Camaro SS comes with a 325 HP LS1 V-8 5.7 Liter engine with a four speed automatic transmission. (You can order it with a six-speed manual.) The 2001 Camaro Z28 only has 310 HP with the same engine. The SS has a forced-air induction that creates the extra HP. 

The SS also has 17-inch aluminum wheels with P275/ 40ZR 17-inch Goodyear Eagle F1 tires. The other Camaro models have 16-inch tires and wheels. It also has a dual exhaust system and the rear spoiler is a little higher than the other models.

It has a Zexel-Torsen differential with limited slip performance rear axel. What it does, it pulls with one wheel in the rear and when the other one starts to spin it will lock into place for better traction.

The SS comes with the Monsoon AM/FM/CD system that has eight speakers and an amplifier that puts out a total of 500 watts. This system is awesome, it is one of the best factory systems I have ever heard.

The cost starts at $26,170 for the SS Coupe and $33,275 for the SS Convertible. The gas mileage is rated at City 17 MPG and Highway 25 MPG, now you and I know when you keep your foot in the throttle it will be a lot less. For the gas you can use 87 octane but they recommend 91 octane.

<b>The Ride</b>
If you are looking for a smooth ride than look elsewhere. The Camaro has a good ride but, you will feel some bumps that you will not feel in a passenger car. This is due to the lower and softer suspension and the extra wide tires that come on it.

As far as handling on the road, it is hard to beat. It will handle curves a good 20 MPH faster than your average passenger car. This car was designed for performance and handling. 

<b>Pros</b>
It is a well-built and beautiful stream lined sports car. 

There is plenty of horsepower and it handles great.

<b>Cons</b>
There are several cons on getting a Camero, that doesn't mean it is a bad product. The cons mainly concern cost and convenience.  

Insurance will cost you more no matter how old you are and how good of a driving record you have.

The tires are 17 inches, they are made of a softer compound to hold the road better. They will cost you around $800 for all four and you will be lucky to get the 40,000 miles out of it like they are rated. 

To change the oil, you will have to jack the car up and once you have the oil plug out you will have to lower it so it will drain properly. Then you have to raise it up to put the oil plug and filter on. (I recommend letting someone else change the oil and filter.)

The spark plugs on a V-6 are almost impossible to change, the ones on the V-8 are suppose to go 100,000 and if you they do need to be changed, I highly recommend to let the dealership change them. There is not any spare room with the V-8 under the hood.

If you are planning on hauling passengers in the back, well it is cramp in the back seat. If your children are young the back seat is fine but, for teenagers and adults there just isn't enough room for the legs. A baby seat will fit nicely in the back.

<b>Overall</b>
The Camaro is not for everyone, it is a sports car with a back seat. The quality and performance that went into the 2001 Camaro SS is great.

The 2001 Camaro SS comes with 3 years or 36,000 miles warranty from bumper to bumper. The body has a six-year or 100,000 miles warranty against rust through. (Both warranties consist of what ever comes first, the years or the miles.) Plus you get 24-hour Roadside Assistance for the 3 years or 36,000 miles.

The engine is designed to go 100,000 miles before a tune up is needed.

The car will run, you have to be careful not to burn the tires when you take off fast. If you hold the throttle down when it shifts to second gear, you can hear the rear tires squalling. It handles excellent in curves and has plenty of performance.

I couldn't believe that they made the SS to outperform the Z28 but, they did. Chevrolet has put the excitement into the Camaro again with the SS.
