            When you go car shopping, you tell yourself to compare, don�t buy the first vehicle you like. I told myself that for months.  I compared and shopped online, surfing local car dealer�s web sites.  I was in the market to purchase a Utility Vehicle. I just had to have a Ford Explorer; no other vehicle would compare. I drove my husband crazy, talking about how I needed a new vehicle, seeing that my 1988 Mercury Cougar was on it's last wheel. hehehe.

One day in August of 1998, my husband, finally in the mood to shop for my Ford Explorer,we headed to town.  On the way, he turns to me and said �now we are not going to buy the first vehicle we see.�  Yea right!
 LOL

We went to one of the largest dealerships in our town that specialize in used vehicles. To my surprise there was not one Ford Explorer on the lot.  The sales person was very persistent, (they always are)LOL. He was not going to let us go home without driving something off the lot.  Need less to say he took us to the service area where vehicles were just coming in, to see if a Ford Explorer had just come in.

As I walked through the service area, I notice this sharp looking car up on a lift. I just so happen to mention, �That�s a sharp looking car�.  Mistake! Boy you should have seen my salesperson go into action... LOL. He had the mechanic bring the vehicle down from the lift.  Before I knew it, I was test driving <b> my</b> 1994 Chrysler Concord.  

All my husband had to see is that the vehicle only had 28k miles.  He asked the salesperson � what�s the best price for this car.� Of course with the vehicle not being on the lot yet, the price was not listed, therefore the sales person had to go to the office and check on the price. This gave my husband and I time to discuss the purchase of this Chrysler Concorde. It was my husband that said. �If the price is right, we need to get this car, with only 28k you can�t go wrong....� NOT! 

I now drive this 1994 Chrysler Concord that we purchased for $11,000.00. Adding the extended warranty came to $13,000.00.
 
 Ok now we have a new car. So we plan a trip out of state... While driving, I keep thinking to myself, this car does not drive very smooth. The car had snow tires!... Heck I didn�t know. I live in Florida! LOL, 
That was the first trip to my mechanic.  New tires were placed on my car.

Since that first trip to my mechanic for new tires, I�ve been a regular customer with my auto mechanic.
SO many things have gone wrong with this car, from a broken tie rod to an oil leak. Not to mention the maintenance, such as new brakes, tires, and alignments on this vehicle, and yes many in just a few years. 
The electronical system, <b>inside and out</b> has it�s problems too.  When I purchased this vehicle, it didn�t come with a remote key lock. Come to find out the door lock sensor went bad on this vehicle. 

 Since I�ve owned this vehicle, I have paid out of pocket almost the cost of the extended warranty.
 And let me add I�ve paid more out of pocket than the Warranty Company has... 

I can tell you the 1994 Chrysler Concord has many recalls...

Let me name recalls I recently received on this vehicle... 1993 through 1995 Models.

<b>Safety Recall to install lower control arm reinforment brackets on vehicle</b>. <i>The lower control arm attaching the brackets may crack and separate from the engine cradle, If this occurs; the transmission half shaft may pull out of the transaxle and cause a loss of power. This will increase the risk of an accident. </i>
I need to bring this recall into my mechanic, sounds like the problem I had with my tie rod...
AND... The extended warranty only paid a portion of the cost to get this problem fixed.

<b>Recall on the Driver�s side power seat adjuster on your vehicle.</b> <i> The driver�s side power seat adjuster may develop a slight fore and aft movement and /or the inboard pivot bracket may break.</i>
Again... This is something I had to get fixed, and extended warranty did not cover this problem.

I also received a Recall on the Oil Rings, which if not corrected may cause a fire in your engine. Boy I feel real safe driving this car.

The 1994 Chrysler Concord is a sharp looking car, very stylish inside and out. With roomy interior, makes the ride comfortable, I really do feel sporty cruising around town in this car, but I don�t go too far because this vehicle is a gas-guzzler.

I know what you are thinking; you should have shopped around. And it was stupid to purchase this vehicle just because it looked sharp. Heck it wasn�t even off the lift in the service area, I can�t blame the Chrysler Corporation fully, I blame myself for trusting the dealership, after all they are a very prominent company in town.
I am going to end with the picture in your mind, of me standing in a parking lot trying to get my alarm to shut off when I open my car door with the key.     After many embarrassing moments of this happening to me, I went to the Chrysler dealership and waited for three hours for them to fix my door sensor and purchase a remote key.  And the cost of that you ask... Oh only $350.00......and nope, it wasn�t covered under the extended warranty...

I wished I had waited and shopped around, After all I didn't want a car I wanted a Utility Vehicle.  MY MISTAKE....
