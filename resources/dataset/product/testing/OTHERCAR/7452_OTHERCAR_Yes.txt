            When I went by the dealership to pick up a new car, I was surprised to see a red 4 door 'sedan' catch my eye.  I immediately asked what type of car it was, not recognizing the model.  &quot;A Pontiac Grand Am GT&quot;, the guy said.  I couldn't believe it!  What a transformation this car has made since the last model.  The body panels add an aggressive look without overdoing it, and the optional chrome mags available really top out the look.  

Taking it for a spin was like heaven.  The ride is stiff, but not harsh, and the car is very responsive.  Understeer is not excessive, and the tuned suspension really provides for some great turning.  This car was so great, I didn't even notice the lack of a manual tranny.

Let me just say that I bought this model, no questions asked.  The interior of my car is mauve leather, and it's just the right softness.  The chairs support when taking haywire turns and the sound system, let me just say, is nothing like convention stock systems.  You would swear there is a sub in the trunk.

Typically a japanese car lover, I actually found this domestic to be a great car at a great price.  I think you'd be surprised if you took it for a spin, it's like a wolf in sheeps clothing.<br><br>
