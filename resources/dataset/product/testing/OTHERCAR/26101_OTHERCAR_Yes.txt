            I bought the Epson PhotoPC 750Z in May, and have already taken over 400 pictures with it. My boss and I were each looking for a personal digital camera, so we each went our separate ways to investigate which camera would be best for our purposes for under $500.
After a week of searching the internet, we both came up with the same camera, the Epson PhotoPC 750Z. I found mine for under $400, so be sure to shop around. 
The photo quality is terrific, even using the lowest graphic settings. A feature I really like, is the solar assisted LCD viewer, so if you are taking pictures outdoors, you won't drain the batteries while using the screen. The camera also has a normal viewfinder, and this zooms along with the lens, so you get an accurate view of your subjects. The camera is very easy to operate. All controls are simple to understand, and to use. The rechargeable batteries seem to last forever, even using flash.
I highly recommend this camera, and I know you will be happy with it too.
