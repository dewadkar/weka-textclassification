            After driving a mid-1990's Honda Accord for a few years, the opportunity to sit at the wheel of a brand new Pontiac Bonneville was extremely appealing.  In addition to being extremely luxurious, the car packs an extremely powerful drive.  The model that I drove was the GTP, which has the supercharged engine, something that I highly recommend.  The car was extremely quick in the corners and had very good pickup, considering how heavy the car is.  The vehicle seems extremely substantial while driving, not nearly as flimsy as cars that I had been used to. Overall, it's an incredible machine. <br><br>
