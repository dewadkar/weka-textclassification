            I bought the Accord a week ago.  Traded in a 2000 Camry LE.  The Accord is more comfortable and responsive than the Camry.

So far the ride appears a little stiffer than the Camry but that may just be new car break in.  The car goes where you steer it without the noticable roll and understeer of the Camry.  It is a pleasure to drive.  The four and the six cylinder is not much of a noticable different for a conservative driver like myself.  I went for the four because it met my requirements.

The car looks good.  I have the tan with leather and went for a few accessories such as the mud flaps, moon roof cover, trunk cargo kit, and the cassette player.  Yes the cassette player is an option.  The trunk cargo kit is a tray of plastic that fits the trunk like a bed liner in a pickup truck.  Makes it easy to clean.

I was disenchanted by the Camry in terms of the driving comfort.  The seats had no support.  The Accord is another story.  The seats have more contour and with the adjustments and bolsters you can find a perfect driving position.  The heaters are a little slow but there is something to be said for having a warm seat on a cold winters day.  Sort of therapeutic as well.  

The tranny shifts are unnoticable and smooth.  The grade logic design also applies downshift on hills.  Very smoooooth.

The cons I have are in comparision to the Camry.  The door locks are on the back of the door instead of by the handle.  It is more convenient to have the option of unlocking and opening the drivers door only, using one hand.  On the Accord you need the right to unlock the door and the left to open it.  More of an annoyance if you don't want to unlock all of the doors.

The front cup holders are very deep.  It is not very condusive to picking up your medium coffee and drinking it without having to readjust your grip.  There is also no cover over the cupholders when not in use.

The headlights do not turn on automatically.  This is a safety concern.  The dash panel is always illuminated.  In fact it brightens up as the sensor on the dash notices that it is getting darker out.  Eventually the thing is glowing lit.  This confuses me into thinking that the headlights are on.  NOT SO.  They also don't auto off until 15 seconds after the car is turned off.  I do not like this "feature".  

The the key and the speedometer are huge as well.  Why so big?

The trunk lid is short.  Nice styling but a bit of a problem for those of use who need to haul the trash cans to the dump every so often.  The cans do not fit in the trunk standing up for the short trip.  The older Accords and the Camry do not have this problem.

Overall I am pleased with my choice.  I was comparing the 03 Camry, and used Acura TL and Lexus GS.  In the end it comes down to Honda vs Toyota for most of us in the middle class.  I've had both and don't think that you can go wrong either way.  This car is a very appealing to the family man that wants to keep the sporty side alive.  It is still not the dream car but it is closer.

"You have an awful lot of complaints about the car, considering you gave it five stars." 

The issues are more annoyances for me. I believe that most people can find annoyances in any car. As I said, not the dream car... but closer. 

Now on to the other stuff 

fit and finish 

I found the car exterior to be exceptional. On my Camry the gaskets on the windshield and rear glass were wavy. The trunk was slightly out of consistent tolerance. On the Accord the exterior is flawless. 

The interior has a wavy window gasket that looks like it was created by the dealer installed option on window vents. The rest of the interior is, frankly, very nice. I find no other flaws. 

interior noise level 
Compared to the Acura TL and the Camry I find the interior to be just as quiet. The OEM tires were overinflated on delivery. With the right tire pressure the ride is quiet. 

handling 
Handling is very responsive. The steering is responsive at slow or fast speeds. I find that the best 

brakes 
Braking appears to be good with little nose dive on strong braking pressure. 

rear seat 
The rear seat is a little lower than the Camry but the same as the TL. It has passed my daughter's inspection for loungability and leg room. 

trunk 
As I stated in my review the only flaw in the trunk is the lid length. The interior dimensions are adequate for the needs of this middle aged man. 


ergonomics 
The layout of the controls is actually quite convenient. The climate controls are easy to manipulate and adjust. The steering wheel mounted cruise and audio controls are very easy to use which allows the driver to pay attention to the road without distraction. 
 
UPDATE 6/10/03
The ride has smoothed out a bit.  I thought it was a little firm at first and expected it to loosen up a bit with use.  It did and it is still a joy to drive.  Wish the steering wheel controls were lit at night.  Sometimes change the channel instead of adjusting the volume and stuff like that.

Fold down rear seat is a must.  If Acura gets with it they may have a chance on my next car, otherwise Honda is it.
