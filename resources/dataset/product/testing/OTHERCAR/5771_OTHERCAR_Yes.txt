            So far, at 500  miles with the 2001 Montero Sport LS 4WD, I'm extremely satisfied with this SUV.  Could the V-6 engine use more power? - Yes, but at a price.  Overall, the performance I get out of this 4,200lb 4WD drive vehicle is a very good trade-off for the 17-21  combined gas mileage.  Especially, when 87 regular unleaded gas currently costs well over $2.00 per gallon where I live.

Originally, I included the Sport in my purchase consideration based on "looks only."  I than began researching the Mitsubishi off-road heritage and reliability.  Added to that, I followed many Mitsu internet chat boards, and found one of the most dedicated...almost rabid...group of vehicle owners I've ever experienced.  I've already been "off-road," albeit a non-four-wheel-drive-required trail...but my junket in some mud showed me the potential of this vehicle.  On road, it's the best handling 4x4 SUV I've tested; everything from Ford, Isuzu, Toyota, Chevy, and Dodge.  Off road, I'm not sure yet...I guess I have to rely on the Mitsu's Dakar heritage! Plus, it has the highest quality interior and exterior fit and finish of all mid-size SUVs.

This is the most comfortable, smoothest riding, and most inclusive-standard equipped SUV on the market, in my opinion.

Anyone looking for a reasonably-priced, fuel efficient, confident - on-road and off-road SUV - should seriously consider the Montero Sport.

<b>UPDATE: 2 years and 30,000 miles later.</b>

Wow, I'm still impressed with this truck!  I've had zero, zip, nada, problem areas.  The Montero Sport has been taken off-road at least 12 times - in light snow, dirt, mud, and on the soft sand at Oceano Dunes.  It has not failed in any of those conditions.  The on-road and off-road ride is extremely impressive.

I've read some interesting reviews about the MS; one review was about a rental vehicle...if I had to rate ANY vehicle based on my experiences with rental cars - I probably could not find any one I'd buy!!  Rentals and "real world" are very different because owners would be taking care of the small issues (i.e. squeaks, rattles, etc.), whereas rental car companies typically don't because they are not the daily drivers.  

So far, the only issue I have with the Montero Sport is the lack of top-end power.  With the 3.0L V-6, I really must know how to pick and choose when it comes to passing other vehicles on the highway.  Around town and on the trail, the 3.0's torque and acceleration is perfect.

<b>EXTERIOR</b>

I still find the Montero Sport to be the most attractive and individually-styled SUV on the market, excluding of course, the oddly-styled, such as the Pontiac Aztek.  All others in the mid-size class tend to blend together.  The Sport's "look" of the exterior can also be deceiving.  With its fluid curves, beltline crease, and inward slanted greenhouse, it appears much smaller than it actually is...until you get up close.  Its interior dimensions actually are larger than the competitors (2001 models - 4Runner, Pathfinder, Explorer, Blazer.  With 2002/3 model redesigns mid-size competitors have actually grown and changed the playing field, a bit).

<b>INTERIOR</b>

At first I was a tad put off by the Montero Sport's dash, until I realized that it was so functional.  I even thought...hmmm, maybe adding some woodgrain - then my wife reminded me why I've always liked my German and Swedish cars' interiors...they JUST WORK!  I truly enjoy the ease of use and functionality of the Sport's interior layout.  Not to mention, the extremely high quality of the plastic that is used.  The dash and switchgear all have a very pleasant tactile feeling.  The comfort of being able to reach everything with my personal 6' frame with ease is great.  The seats and seating position are very comfortable for in-town driving and on long hauls.

Road and wind noise: not much.  You will get some wind noise around the A pillars from the over-sized mirrors.  I didn't have any road noise until I replaced the M S Yokohama tires with the Goodrich All Terrains...then I got a bit of tread noise filtering into the cabin.

<b>HANDLING</b>

It's a truck.  Anyone wanting a car-based SUV-wannabe-4x4 might not be happy with this vehicle, or any body-on-frame (truck-based) platform vehicle.  Steering is also a little vague at highway speeds with its recirculating ball setup.  The vehicle handles much better on-road than the 4Runner, Rodeo, and Pathfinder.  Under heavy load the rear coil suspension has a tendency to bottom out.  There is a Mitsubishi Technical Service Bulletin to help alleviate this problem.

As far as SUV side-to-side body sway - it was a little unsettling with the factory Yokohama Geolanders.  Once I replaced the Yokos with Goodrich All Terrain tires, the problem was solved.  Any excessive side to side appears to have been the result of the thinner sidewalls on the stock tires.

Acceleration: once again, the 165 horses in the 3.0 litre does not provide much get up and go at higher speeds.  The engine does keep on pulling, and pulling, and pulling - but you won't be seeing any "kick down and go" when passing.  My average gas mileage is around 19 MPG.

Offroad: Have not had any problems, so far.  Unfortunately, locking diffs are not available with the LS model.  But, I have still had no problems with my offroading.

<i>Would I buy again: Yes.</i>  I'm thinking about buying a used (2001/2002) for my wife.  Mitsubishi, like any other manufacturer (other than Toyota and Honda; Big Three SUVs - still high market demand) don't hold their value like they should.  Same problem with Chevy/Ford/Chrysler CARS, Nissan, Hyuandai, Kia, etc.
