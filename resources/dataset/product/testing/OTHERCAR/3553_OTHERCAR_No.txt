            This is my first Digital camera we bought 2 years ago.  We were looking for a cheap camera because we didn�t know how much we would like a digital camera.

Cons:
Well comparing to other people that have 2 mega pixel cameras the quality was very poor.  I have compared to Fugi 2800 and Canon S110.  Those were substantially better in any kind of light. The pictures on the HP were even worse at low light levels.  It gets real grainy you can see the little color specs.  
Plus not to mention there is no optical zoom.  Witch I thought the digital zoom would be ok but the quality seems to get worse when you use it.
Last but not least there is about a 4 to 5 seconds between taking pictures.  I guess it is due to it writing to the card.  But if you are trying to take pictures of something fast like a sports game be prepared to miss allot waiting for the camera to be ready.

Pros:
It is really easy to use witch is one good thing.  The menus are easy to navigate.  The software was easy as well you just hook the camera up and turn it on.  Then brings up a box to let you choose to download or share and other things.  It also makes the folder on your computer and names it with the date and time.
The camera is also pretty durable since I have dropped it a few times and it has never had a problem.

Overall:
With the ease of use and the durability very good, it still doesn�t make up for poor quality pictures.
