            In 1998 a friend of mine sold me his 1995 Suzuki Swift.  It was red, cute, cheap, in good condition, and I fell in love with it.  Since I didn't get my driver's license until a year later, it stood outside my parents' house for a looooong time.  Now I use it every day.

Let's start with the thing I like most about it: it handles like a dream.  I learned how to parallel park in a Mercedes 190 and it was a nightmare!  I used to dread having to park somewhere!  Now I do it like it's the easiest thing in the world. Its relatively brief turning radius allows my Suzuki Swift to steer circles around larger cars and easily work itself into the narrowest parking space.  

The five-speed manual shifter is easy to use, and driving on the highway in fifth gear is a pleasure I'd never imagined possible.

Though the gas tank doesn't seem to hold a lot of gallons, I've heard that my car seem delivers some of the best fuel economy figures of all gas-burning cars.  And they're right.

Oh, and why call it my bingo car?  Because the words "bingo" are (discreetly) pasted on the side of the car.  But now my son keeps thinking that I won my car in a lottery or something...
