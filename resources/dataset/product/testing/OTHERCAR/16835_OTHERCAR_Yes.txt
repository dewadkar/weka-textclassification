            Bought one used with 78k miles. I drive very little (except for trips to the great outdoors), so the (supposedly) expensive repair/maintenance and gas bills won't be a problem for me. This was a significant consideration, since I hate spending money on cars.

Advantages:
===========
Solid build, powerful engine (3.5L V6), very comfortable, cavernous sunroof, big wheels/tires, excellent visibility, flexible seating arrangement, 7 passenger seating, compass/temperature/inclinometer is a really cool and useful gadget, tons of headroom, large steering wheel, excellent handling/steering, locking rear differential, shift-on-the-fly 4wd, toolkit/flashlight in back door, etc

Disadvantages:
==============
rattling jumpseats (when folded up), possibly uncomfortable 2nd row bench when seating 3 people due to sides being angled up, although I never have more than 2 people in the car, so I can't say for sure.

If you can find one in good condition (with all maintenance history), you don't drive too much, you actually NEED off-road capability, and you want to drive something very few people have, go for it!
