            I have wanted a digital camera for awhile now and searched many websites and stores to see what the differences were and how the prices stacked up against each other.  Eventually, I found the Olympus D-600l and could not pass it up.  

First of all, the camera is so easy to use it could be described as foolproof.  You use it just like a normal camera and it really could not be easier.  You begin by loading the batteries and affixing the strap (Probably the most difficult part of the process). 

From here you the differences between a normal camera and a digital camera, as far as operation goes, are negligible.  You simply take the lens off (DUH!) focus and take the picture.  One caution:  Remember that you have to be in record mode in order to take a picture.  There are two modes- record and play- and the selector will not take a picture if it is not in the record mode.

One of the best features of digital cameras is that you can see the photo you will be taking before taking it.  Then, you can immediately see what you took and erase it if do not like it.  A big positive for the Olympus camera is that the photos that appear after they are taken are extremely clear.  I have seen other cameras where the picture is not so clear and then you have a hard time distinguishing whether or not the photo is good or not.  Not a problem with the Olympus.  Additionally, a huge advantage over traditional cameras is that you can erase a picture that you do not like, rather than spending the money to have the photo developed before deciding that you do not like it.

Another aspect that I like about the camera is that you can dictate what kind of photo quality you would like.  The higher the quality of the photo, the fewer photos you can take because of the increased memory that you will use.  However, the Olympus will take 12 photos at &quot;high quality&quot; before you need to download or erase.  One negative is that you can only take four photos at &quot;highest quality&quot;.  However, since you can erase as you go, you can dictate the pictures that you want to keep.

The downloading process is simple with Olympus.  All you do is insert a disc and then download.  After the downloading you will see your photos and can then print them on your printer, send them via email, or take the disc to be developed.  Regardless of how you develop the photos, they come out very well.  I am sure this has something to do with the quality of the printer, but I have had nothing but positive experiences with the printouts.

Finally, I will mention that the directions could not be easier.  The booklet is about 100 pages, but the pages are tiny and include two other languages.  Hence, the directions per each page are little more than a few sentences and are easy to follow- except for the strap attachment.  I would recommend, without hesitation, the Olympus D-600l to anyone looking for a digital camera.<br><br>
