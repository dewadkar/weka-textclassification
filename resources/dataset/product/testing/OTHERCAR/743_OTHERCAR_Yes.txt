            I bought a used 1994 Nissan Altima GXE in 1996.  This was a trade up from the Nissan Sentra I had been driving.  I bought this model for the features (A/C, power windows/locks/antenna, dual airbags) and because I wanted a larger car.  Thus far I am very glad that I made this decision.  

Things I like:  The Altima handles vert well and is a pleasure to drive.  It is quiet and the ride is smooth.  It is fairly economical for its size, I average about 32 MPG.  Since I have owned this car, there have been no major problems.  It has been in one accident which required substantial body work to the left front end.  The car still runs like a charm.

Things I don't like:  It is expensive to repair.  Small routine maintainence items are pricey.  I have over 100,000 miles on the car and things are needing repair.  I am currently have a problem with the computer that controls the tachometer output and will have to take the car to a dealership for repair.  This will be an expensive fix.

I would highly recommend the Altima.<br><br>
