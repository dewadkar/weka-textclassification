            I bought this camera mainly from opinions based on epinions.com. I was really happy with this camera. Other opinions said the battery life was too short. I didn't have any problem with it. The pictures are great, it's easy to use, but after a month it died. I sent it back to Olympus on October 16th. They say they typically have a camera in for warranty repair for 12 days. It's November 18th, still no camera. I called for the status, they said soon, but didn't give me a date. I love this camera, but the service/warranty turn around sucks. Great general purpose camera, especially for the money.<br><br>
