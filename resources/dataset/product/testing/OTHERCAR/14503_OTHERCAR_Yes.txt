            Last week my husband and I purchased the 2001 Frontier 4x4 SEV6. It has a one of a kind look, that makes it stand out from the crowd. The body styling is sleek and bold. It has 170hp 3.3 liter 6-cyl engine, this standard. You can upgrade it to the 210hp engine. The standard equipment included offers a lot more. Where some makes don't include much and just about everything is an option.
On the mechanical and Performance equipment I receved:
fuel injection,5,000 lb. towing capacity,power front disc/rear drum breaks,power steering,auto locking hubs, s-speed transfer case, limited slip differential
On exterior:
16" aluminum alloy wheels, full size spare tire, step rails/front and rear mudgurads,fog lamps
On comfort and convenience:
cfc-free A/C,AM/FM/CD audio system w/ 6 speakers, leather wrapped steering wheel,rear seating for three,power windows,door locks and mirrors,remote keyless entry
On Safety:
4- wheel anti-lock braking system w/ G-sensor,second generation dual airbags, 3 child seat anchors
All of the above are standard options. I had the Deluxe package added, this included the cruise control, tilt wheel,AM/FM/6CD changer ( the system with the 6 cd changer sounds much better than the single cd player),and steering wheel controls for radio and cruise control. I also purchased the bed liner and bed extender.
I feel very safe in this truck, I also feel my children will also be safe too. 
The ride is smooth and drives just like a car. The seats seem comfortable, but I haven't taken a long trip yet. The back bench seat is a good size. Just the leg room isn't there for any back seat passengers. For children there is more than enough of room.
The interior doesn't have a lot a gadgets, just your basics. The radio is central and very easy to reach. The center console isn't large, but it'll hold two cups in the holders.
The glove compartment is very small. The most you'll fit in there is your vehicle papers.
The truck bed is a little longer than the Ford Dakota quad cab. With the Nissan you're giving up some back seat space for more bed space.
Another plus with this truck it did well on the crash tests. The doors have steel side-door guard beams, and front crumple zones. Also it has hood buckling creases and safety stops. While driving in this truck I don't have to worry to much.
The truck has a 19.5 gallon tank. I've gotten pretty good gas mileage. I get up to 300 miles on a full tank. Considering the gas prices, this truck does well on gas.
The truck has six different colors to choose from. You will be able to choose from two interior cloth seat colors and four different patterns. If you like leather, you will get two color choices.
So far I'm enjoying my new truck. I'm very satisfied with Nissan. I just can't wait to try it on the off road....
