                    First off I would like to tell you this review is going to be short and sweet. I only do reviews on automobiles from strictly an undercar view. I have written 6 or 7 and will continue to only review this aspect of cars, the steering and suspension systems.

     I already did a review on the Subaru Legacy regular sedan, and don't want to plagarise myself and create sort of a double listing. If you want to read that review,do so, all of the pertinant information for this vehicle is exactly the same as that.

    In my opinion Subaru has designed one of the best suspension systems of its class. This one is no exception, it is an almost fully adjustable suspension of exceptional quality and engineering. Virtually every new all wheel drive Subaru shares this well made suspension and at the risk of gushing, you cannot go wrong in trusting it.

     As you review the other opinions on this automobile, remember that you can file this one in your &quot;don't worry about it&quot; area , and be at ease with knowing you will be well taken care of. Weigh all the other aspects of what you want in an automobile and if everything hits the mark with you, you have a decision already made for you.<br><br>
