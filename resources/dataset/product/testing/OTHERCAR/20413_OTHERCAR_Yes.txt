            The Volkswagen Jetta has certainly come a long way since the late 70's hasn't it. From the old Jetta GLI, to the introduction of the VR6, to this newest 4th generation version, there is alot of history behind it. 
I recently purchased a 2000 Silver Jetta GLS 5-speed with the moonroof + alloys package, a rear deck spoiler, woodgrain interior package, and black leather interior. 
It reminds me of a little Audi, or maybe a Diet Audi. :) The fit and finish is extremely detailed and everything on the car seems to be made of the highest quality materials. The car looks gorgeous, especially without a front license plate or bracket to mess up the front-end look. I bought this car because I have always liked Jettas and the way they look, but also for the general vibe that they have; Volkswagen has always been kind of a cult company, and they have the most loyal fans I have ever seen, if you don't know what I mean, go to any VW car show and you will understand. I actually think that with this new generations of VW they lost some of thier "cult" status, but these are still wonderful vehicles with proven german engineering. 
The Jetta's ride is very firm, and tight around corners. There is definetly some body roll, but that is expected in a vehicle in this class. It CAN be quite fast when it is pushed, but alot of times the little 2.0 L 115hp engine is a tad bit weak for this heavy car. If you want to splurge, I have test driven the 1.8T and the VR6 Jetta, the Turbo is the best of both worlds (and lighter), but the VR6 is incredible (torquey, tire burning monster!). The underpowered engine is especially noticable when the A/C is on (The A/C works very well however). Don't get me wrong, its not a slow car, especially not the 5-speed, in fact it is one of the best and most reliable powerplants VW has mae lately. It is based off the previous Jetta 2.0 Liter engine. Physically it is the same it just uses a refined intake and some more complicated fuel injection systems (more computerized Bosch set-up) for the ever changing ODB 2 emissions requirements. The fuel consumption is very good as well, probably 24/30.
The styling is great, it is wider looking and the front is more aggressive looking than previous Jetta which is a plus in my book. The stock GLS 15 inch rims are nice thick 5-stars, and the tires that came on mine were Michelin's. The Jetta comes with 3 different tire types. Goodyears, Michelins and Bridgestones. VW has been having horrible problems with the Goodyear tires, having them wear funny and losing tread early. I heard from a VW rep that in back of the Volkswagen of America building in Michigan there are several dumpsters and big tractor trailer full of these defective tires all tagged with a "Quality Control Issues" tag. However, the local dealerships have been replacing the Goodyears and the Bridgestones and Michelins are great tires. The new body style brought new wider track wheels and tires which adds to the fun and handling of these cars. They are wonderful in the snow, even without snow tires, the chassis is so tight and rigid, they can crawl out of some slippery situations. 
This is also a very safe car. the chassis is very rigid and it absorbs impacts very well, in addition to the driver and passenger side airbags, each front seat has a side airbag built into the outer side. It literally rips out of the seat and wraps around the side of your body and head in the event of a accident. The car also has ABS which is a nice feature in the frigid Northeast.
The ride is very smooth, it is a good combination of firmness and dampening, without losing the feel of the road that VW's are known for. It is quiet and pleasant, which brings me to the next thing.. the stereo system. New for 2000 is the optional Monsoon sound system which comes on a great majority of the vehicles they sell. It is a really good system as far as stock stereos go. There is a built-in power amp in the trunk and with a cd-player or changer, it is incredible. The heated leather seats are reccomended over the cloth ones, they are so comfy, you could live in them. The rear seats are kind of small, but only in leg room, that could possibly be because we always drive with the seat way back.
On a side note, the blue illumination of the instrument cluster and the dashboard instrumets it the most impressive I have ever seen, it really has to be seen to be believed. 
Ok, enough rambling for me. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this vehicle, it may be a little pricey but the quality is incredible and trust me, you are getting alot of car for the money. Just think "Audi - lite"!  :) 

Update (9/28/01): I've been driving the beautiful Jetta for over a year now and I am happy to report that I haven't had a single problem. My original manufacturers warranty is almost out, but it doesn't matter to me. I still love my car!
