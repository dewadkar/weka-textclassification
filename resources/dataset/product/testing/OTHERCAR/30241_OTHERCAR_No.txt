              I just went to Ebay and was grieved to see so many Agfa ePhoto Smile Digital Cameras being auctioned off, and so many people bidding on them.  I wish I could warn them.  If they would only visit Epinions and merely read the titles of opinions on this camera, they would be thoroughly convinced that THIS IS NOT A CAMERA YOU WANT TO OWN!
  
The Agfa Smile is a 640 x 480 resolution (though I'm not convinced of that) and comes with software and cable so you can download your pictures to your computer - assuming you manage to get the thing to take any pictures for you.  It's a very pretty-looking blue camera, which makes it tempting to buy.
  
  I had the acute misfortune of winning a bid on Ebay for one of these digital non-performers shortly before I joined Epinions.  

I've never lamented the loss of $65 more than this.  

We wanted to take pictures of our son Dylan that we could email to relatives so we were very eager to get started when the camera arrived.  Being the man of the house, I thought I could figure out this camera pretty quickly, so I opened the package, put the batteries in (2 AA), got it set up, and all went well -- for the first 3 pictures.  Then it absolutely refused to work after that.  We would turn it on and the little light at the back would blink forever, and never get ready to take pictures.

  I figured we'd gotten a faulty camera. Completely exasperated, I was about ready to stomp on the camera and throw it in our wood stove. Burn the little devil. But my wife Tanis, who wanted a digital camera more than me, kept working patiently with it, trying to figure it out.

  The man that sold it to us had included a plug-in that we could use to run the camera off regular power instead of batteries, but the voltage settings on it were not exactly what this camera wanted, so we kept trying with batteries.  Tanis soon discovered that the only way the camera would work at all was if the batteries were in top-notch condition.  <i>Four pictures</i> with flash were enough to render the batteries useless for the finicky Agfa.  

  When she finally got enough pictures taken, she downloaded them onto the computer (another trial all its own) and we found out <i>another</i> thing about this camera.  The picture quality is HORRIBLE.  It comes up with it's own colors for things.  You can take two consecutive pictures of the same thing, with the same lighting, and the two pictures will come out completely different.  It's a very rare thing for a picture to come out looking like the thing you were photographing. 
  
After reading some of the reviews on this camera, I didn't think I would need to write one of my own, but knowing some friends of mine that might be wanting shortly to buy a digital camera (as well as anyone else who might come across this review), I felt compelled to warn you about this one.  Many people who are considering getting a digital camera will buy the cheapest one they can find so they can learn about them and get used to using them before they commit $300 - $800 on a nice one.  The Agfa ePhoto Smile (Cringe) is <b>not the one</b> to learn on. There are few 640 x 480 resolution cameras that are worth the price.  The Agfa ePhoto Smile is at the very bottom of them all.
  Your Christmas tree will drop its ornaments in shame if you place one of these cameras under its branches as a gift this year.

<b>Update July, 2001</b>

Well, there are fewer and fewer Agfa ePhoto Smile's being posted on Ebay now.  And people aren't bidding them up as high.  (Hopefully it's because Epinions really <i>is</i> helping people make better buying decisions!) This is good news, though I <i>do</i> feel a tiny bit sorry for people who were duped into buying tons of these to try and resell.

<I><b>Why get a digital camera?</b></i>

You may not need to plunge right away into a $500 digital camera like the one suggested below by Epinions, but you can find a long list of cameras on this site with opinions on each one.  I have a friend who spent a little over $200 on one, and we have enjoyed using it and viewing the photos it takes.

My computer has a lot of memory space, so I can take all the pictures I want, upload them, and save only the ones I that I like.  With regular film cameras, you pay for each picture you take and develop, and you have to pay for reprints.  With digital, I can email pictures to anybody and everybody, whereas with regular pictures I have to consider who I <i>really</i> want to get reprints for because I can't afford too many reprints.

It's definitely best to wait and save your pennies a little longer to get a better camera than to waste it on an Agfa ePhoto Smile.  That's what I'm doing now...

Have fun!
