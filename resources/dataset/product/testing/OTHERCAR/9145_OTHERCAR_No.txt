            The Plymouth brand was dropped from the Prowler name, and it became a Chrysler last year. To mark the change, a new "Mulholland Edition" was introduced in a dark blue with white pin striping. Also new was the two new paint schemes for its over-the-top Prowler. The top of the car being black and the sides are silver.  The "Black Tie Edition".  It also includes a silver instrument cluster bezel & silver floor mats. Theres a new color, Prowler Orange. Silver will still be offered, but red, yellow, black and purple are discontinued. 

Someone commented as to the reason for the new paint schemes; "Chrysler might figure it can create more interest if it brings out different colored versions -- like Beanie Babies".

Wish it's performance matched its looks. It does not live up to expectations on the road. Modeled after traditional hot rods of the 1950s, the Prowler is equipped with massive 20-inch chrome wheels in back, fronts are 17 inch. With its extremely high beltline, you'll feel like you're a toddler in a bath tub.  With the top up, there is no visibility.

The retro aluminum bodywork is wrapped around an all-aluminum frame supported by an aluminum four-wheel independent suspension. Welcomed adjustable dampers let you soften the ride, as this roadster tends to ride harshly. 

V6 engine, 253 hp and 255 foot-pounds of torque.  No V8 and NO STICK!  

If the styling isn't attracting enough attention, you can crank up the 320-watt Infinity sound system, with speed-compensated volume control, to make sure everyone notices you. So if youre an old fart, who needs to attract attention.  Buy the prowler.  Just don't try to drag race anyone.
