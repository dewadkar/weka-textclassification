            I bought my ML320 when they first came out on the market. My big motivation for buying one had nothing to do with the nameplate or the car like ride. My wife is an amateur naturalist and so we often find ourselves out in the middle of the most desolate areas you can imagine. After having a breakdown on a bad dirt road in my previous (non-4wd) van I explained to my wife that if we were to continue to go out looking for these exotic and obscure animals then we were going to need a four wheel drive truck of some kind. Once that decision was made I started my research.

After looking at everything on the market, including Range Rover, Humvee, Land Cruiser, Jeep and Lexus, I finally decided to get the ML320. Why? Because of the way Mercedes designed the 4wd system. After reviewing what was said about the ML320 on the 4x4abc.com web site I figured that this would be a great fit for my needs. After reading other reviews and test driving one I was convinced. 

So how do I like it? I love it! Not only does it handle like a dream on the road, it handles like a dream off-road as well. This is a truck that makes it easy to get over tough terrain. I have crossed small creeks with it, I have gone over very rough dirt roads that I could not get through with a car, but the ML320 just goes through like it's nothing at all. I have gone up steep hillsides that I probably shouldn't have tried to go up, but the ML320 just climbs like it's part mountain goat or something.
 
Realize this is not a great rock jumper or something that is Rubicon ready. But for taking on really bad roads in style, and getting through muck that would make a Range Rover have a really bad day, it's hard to beat the ML320. Just don't forget that the best tool you have off road is your brain - USE IT! 

As far as bad things are concerned, the truck has had some minor problems but the dealer has always stepped up and fixed everything right the first time. Since mine was a first year model I anticipated that there might be some problems. Overall I like mine a lot and I plan to keep it for years to come.
