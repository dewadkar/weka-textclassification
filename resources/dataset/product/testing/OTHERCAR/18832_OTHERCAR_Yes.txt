               Are you a person who's into photography, likes to send pictures home to friends and family but is too far and doesn't have enough time to hassle with gizmos and gadgets that make time seem even more valuable?
   The PV-SD4090 is a great digital camera for those who like to keep it simple, yet aren't your basic 'point and shoot' photographers.  I paid almost $700 for this camera, which I was definately not disappointed with, and have been able to experience almost all aspects of digital photography and more (such as the capability to record up to 10 seconds of 10fps quality of Quicktime format video).  
   The idea behind this camera of being capable to record video is not what initially captured my attention, it was the ability to save your pictures directly to a 3 1/4&quot; floppy disk or super disk.  Since I am not one who can just go out and buy something like a super disk drive anytime I want, so I use just regular floppy disks which can store up to 17 normal size pictures.
   I don't know what you read about the add about this camera just before reading this article, but this camera does in fact have a 3x optical zoom and a 2x digital zoom which the digital zoom unfortunately is to 'pixelated' to use in order to get those perfect pictures your looking for.  The camera also has the capabilities to store up to 1,500 shots on a super disk, but that is normal quality pictures and only on a super disk.  If you are looking for those great quality 'super fine' shots, you will be able to hold only 5 pictures on each disk.
   Like I said earlier about this camera about how it makes pictures quick and easy to get up and on your computer; well, all you have to do is take a picture of the desired subject, pull the disk from the camera after it finishes writing to the disk, and it is already saved as a JPEG on the disk so you can have it e-mailed out in under 5 minutes of even taking the photo!
   The only part about the camera that I have been disappointed about so far, is that while taking pictures, it takes too long to write to the disk sometimes.  If you taking several shots and need to take continuous snapshots, but don't want them in normal mode like the camera offers in that mode, then you have to take one pictures and then wait almost 15 seconds before being able to take the next; and I know for a fact all you sports fans out there, if you are at a basketball game and want those large size detailed shots, then I know this camera will disappoint you right off.  For you nature lovers or photographers that are into taking quality portrait shots, this camera would almost be perfect for you.
   One last thing, for all of you who have big hands and just hate trying to grip those dainty little cameras with the small grips on them; you'll love to get your hands on this beast!  This camera holds like a full size 35mm SLR camera except for the retractable lens of course.
   So if you want a durable, easy, and quick to use digital camera; get ready to fork out some cash for an investment you won't be sorry nor disappointed of.
