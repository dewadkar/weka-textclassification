            To anyone familiar with the Honda CRX (mainly the Si version) they are accustomed to pinpoint handling, smooth acceleration, and a decent amount of torque for a 1.6.  Well, two outta three ain't bad for the Insight.  While the handling and smoothness of the Insight are ever-present, don't expect to win any stoplight races with it.  

Continuing with what's working, Honda stuck with a front wheel drive layout with the Insight, and with an electric-assisting engine (called the IMA, or the Integrated Motor Assist) to boost fuel mileage to an astounding 70mpg.  While most owners (myself included) have yet to reach that mark (although I haven't really tried) the mileage is significantly better than my previous CRX.  

So far we've said it handles great, gets great gas mileage, and has a smooth transfer from 1.0 liter engine to the electric counterpart.  But what are the negatives?

Well, for one, the thing is absolutely ugly.  If they could have developed a lighter CRX body to throw this engine combo into, they should have.  The CRX was gorgeous, especially the 2nd generation ('88-'91) models.  

Two, the aluminum body panels are more susceptive to dings and dents.  And aluminum is hard to repair, so replacement is often the only option.

And third, the weight limit.  The insight has a cargo limit of 365 pounds.  So if you weigh 180 pounds, and your buddy is a round 210, make him walk.  Kinda sucks, huh?

The consensus?  Give me my 40mpg CRX, and I'd be happier.  Bar none.<br><br>
