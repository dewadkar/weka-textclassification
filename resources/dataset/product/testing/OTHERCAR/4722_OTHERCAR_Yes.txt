            INTRO: 
Cameras suffer from the problem of "moores law" which essentially mean that they are advancing quickly and every few years or so, your camera will go into obsolecense. Which is why, like with my computer purchases, I go with the standard +1 rule. I buy what is currently the standard in quality performance, but one step up. Usually this has treated me better than trying to buy cutting/bleeding edge technology which cameras suffer greatly from.

INITIAL:
Right off I was happy. It takes great 4.0 Megapixel pictures in automatic mode, has a handy little folding LCD which I thought would be useless, but is actually pretty awesome for self-portraits and other interesting shots (still life). The camera uses AA batteries which, though more practical if you travel, can be annoying in regards to battery-life. The zoom is 3x and had a digital zoom  (which I will probably never use) I haven't used all the features yet, since I have had the camera for only a few weeks. 

USING IT:
The quality is great, and the prints that turn out also. The color is usually right-on, except in low light situations. The 3x zoom doesn't allow for much flexibility. I haven't tried the digital zoom. The camera is VERY feature rich, and I am already enjoying shooting in manual mode, you can control the aperture and speed with the VERY ergonomic controls, and even the flash power can be set which I enjoyed. The software that came with the camera is actually pretty good, though you cant do much in the way of editing. 32MB card that is provided is barely adequate for much, but it's nice to have as an extra (I bought a 256MB card, and it's fine for our needs). The batteries don't last long naturally, especially with using the flash, so rechargables are a must. It would have been nice if the camera came with the AC adapter, so at least you aren't killing the batteries when you are downloading pictures to the computer. Speed is pretty good, I like the autofocus. The viewfinder is also nice, and zooms when you zoom

The small LCD is both a con and a pro, it saves battery life, but it's also hard to tell whether a shot is good or not.
