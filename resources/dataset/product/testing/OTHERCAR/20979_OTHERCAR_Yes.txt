                The second generation of Miata is one of the purest essences of open-air motoring I believe that's out there. The way it's been engineered to handle like a go-kart, the way it's packaged as a minimalist roadster, the clean, classic styling, and the way it's stayed true to it's original intentions of being a fun, affordable sportscar and, surprisingly, has not strayed from that after all these years. 
    
    My '01 MX-5 LS is Pure White with an all black leather interior and has the 5-speed (only way to fly ;), CD player, and the optional hard top. Having the hard top on it makes it look almost like an entirely different car, in my opinion and I like the looks.
    
    I love the cockpit of this car. It feels very intimate as it is a smallish car, but it's very well laid out, with very high quality materials used and in a pleasing way. Once you're down into the car, you sit in a very comfortable, sporty bucket that holds you. You face a thick, grippy 3-spoke Nardi steering wheel, and 5 white-faced gauges ringed in chrome telling you the essentials (gas gauge, tachometer, oil gauge, speedometer, and temperature). Then there's also a pretty good sounding Bose stereo and below that is your HVAC controls with easy, large knobs. There's also a switch to shut the passenger air-bag off and a power source/cigarette lighter. And it has the essential cup holder and storage bins.
    
    The best part of this car is the drive though. It's light and precise steering, small size, light weight, rear wheel power delivery and nimble handling all translate to really great handling close to that of a go-kart. Fun as hell. The 1.8-liter 4-cylinder, as small as it sounds, actually moves this car quite well, and with some gusto actually. Of course, for maximum fun and performance, you gotta go with a manual transmission, and Mazda gives you two choices, a 5 or a 6 speed, and an automatic as well). I'm happy with the 5-speed, it shifts precisely and intuitively. This engine makes 142 horses @ 7000 rpm and 125 lb-ft. of torque @ 5500 rpm, and sounds good doing it. It should get about 23 mpg in the city and 28 mpg on the highway.  
   
    It picks up nicely, and does the reverse as well. It has firm, sure-feeling 4-wheel disc brakes.
   
    The Bose stereo is great, and fills the small cabin quite well. I haven't tried it as of yet with the top down yet or on the highway, but it's very satisfactory so far.
    
   The view all around the car is great, with not alot of car there to look around, and if you have the top down... however, even the hardtop isn't too hard to see out of. The thing that worries me the most is not my being able to, but rather others being able to see me. The car's small size is really evident while passing an Expedition or the like and just pray that they see me.

    Sound intrusion isn't too bad either. In town it's pretty good, no Mercedes, but this is a sportscar after all. And highway driving is pretty good too.
   
    Overall, I love the car, the whole package works quite well and it's nice to have the original (excepting the MG) 2-seat sportscar thats still affordable. And you get a nice warranty through Mazda too, a 3 year (36 month) or 50,000 miles, whichever occurs first, plus Emergency Roadside Assistance throughout your warranty.
