            This car is very fast for such a good price and are moderately easy to come by that is if you want one.Most people think you have to spend a lot of money for a sports car that is reliable and fast thats because everyone sees a fast sports car as a viper or porsche.the maintinence isn't all that hard if you know what your doing or if you take it to the right shop.I like the way the car handles (power sliding)but most people would'nt.the car can get off to a good start due to the fact that it has 300hp engine that can probably top out at 140+ with the right conditions.It has all leather interior and has a fast sleek look that will draw anyones attention so if your looking for a fast sports car at a good price choose the 300zx.<br><br>
