            Our son was born in August and my sister wanted us to send her his every move through e-mail photos so she loaned us her Polaroid 640 digital camera. My husband is much better at figuring out electronics than I am but I had no problem using the Polaroid camera.  It was so easy but the picture quality not that great.  

After using the Polaroid for a couple months, we decided to buy our own digital camera.  We decided on the Kodak DC4800 because we had heard good things about it and it was on sale for under $500.00.  We have 35 mm camera equipment but being able to shoot a picture and see it instantly was really appealing. 

The Kodak DC4800 has a resolution of 3.1 megapixels so the pictures come out looking clear and professional.  When I would use Ofoto.com to upload digital photos for printing from the Polaroid camera, they would come back somewhat fuzzy when printed.  With the Kodak pictures, even larger photos I ordered looked as good as ones taken with our Canon 35mm.  I have ordered 8x10 photos that turned out very well from the digital camera. 

The other feature I really like is the different photo modes for pictures.  You can select black and white, sepia toned, saturated for deeper colors, and other options.  Each of the modes gives your photos a completely different feel to them.  The sepia is sort of fun to play with because it is like taking old time photos. 

If you are interested in the specifics of the camera, it comes with the camera body, a compact flash card, lithium ion battery, AC adapter, USB cable, cable for viewing pictures on the TV, Kodak software, and user guides.  The camera also comes with a strap so you can wear it around your neck.  The feel of the camera is a lot like a 35mm.  

There are still some features that I am not that comfortable using and my husband has figured them out much quicker than I have.  The Polaroid camera we used had alot fewer options and I could operate it easily.  This one is easy to operate but I haven't learned all the neat tricks to it yet. 

Some of the features include a 3.1 megapixel resolution, a 1.8" LCD viewfinder, a 3X optical zoom lens, automatic or manual settings, a self-timer, and a built in flash.  I haven't played with the manual settings much and usually stick to automatic but the lens can go from a wide angle view to a telephoto shot.  With the viewfinder, you can see the photo and decide right then whether you want to keep it.  You can also use accessories with the lens, which is nice if you have filters.  The camera also has a tripod mount but we haven't used that. 

The highest resolution is 2160 x 1440 but you get fewer pictures so if I just want some quick snapshots to email then I stick with lower settings for more pictures. If I am having them printed then I always use the highest resolution setting for best quality.  With different ISO settings at 100,200, and 400 you can change how your photo will look when it comes out.  The different settings are good for changes in lighting.  

This has been a really good buy for us and fits our needs.  I can take professional looking photos by just clicking the camera with automatic settings.  I don't need all the fancy settings like my husband.  He likes to toy around more with the manual settings and different features.  So the camera suits both of us just fine. 

The software was easy to install and even easier to use.  It didn't take long to figure this out at all.  I couldn't be more pleased because I don't have to wait on my husband to figure it out for me.  I can now upload photos that I want printed all on my own. 

If you aren't a electronics genius and just want something to take good photos this is a great camera.  If you have a husband that likes to tinker with different features then this is good for them too because there is plenty of options and they will keep busy reading the manual.
