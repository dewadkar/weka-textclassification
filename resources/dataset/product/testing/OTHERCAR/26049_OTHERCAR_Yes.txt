            This is our second full size Montero.  We've been hauling our 3 kids everywhere in these things.  Great off-road, excellent up hill hi speed acceleration, terrific in snow.  You see a lot of them in mountain country. 

Has the best headroom/cargo room of the smaller SUVs. That was a big selling point for us.  Many of those mid-90's SUVs are just too small and cramped. Though leg room could be better, Montero's are pretty big on the inside. Good mileage and maintenance record. Kids like the rear jump seats.

So-so low speed acceleration and not nearly as smooth and solid as the newer SUVs.  Overall quality is ok., about in the mid-range.

The Montero's have problems with their exhaust manifolds, and cylinder heads, i.e. they seem prone to cracks.  If you are buying one used this is sometime to be wary of. Problems showed up in both our cars after 60k miles.  They also go through brakes pretty fast, and require premium pads.  

In sum, both Montero's have been terrific values for us, even with some  maintenance. Big, safe and practical vehicles.  Our white/grey '95 still looks like a newer SUV, and actually gets compliments! - wow.  <br><br>
