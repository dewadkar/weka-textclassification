            We have owned our 1991 LS 400 since the fall of 1992.  The car had 6000 miles when purchased, though it currently has 135,000 miles on the odometer.  The car still drives as well as it did when new, though the interior and exterior show the type of wear that one might expect after ten years of use.  
Though new luxury cars today offer navigation systems and other computer gadgets that were not available on the ''91 LS400, every detail of this car is very well thought out.  For example, the antenna for the sound system is only deployed when the tuner function is used - the antenna does not extend when a CD or tape is played.  Speaking of the radio, the sound system in this car is simply amazing - newer systems might offer more power, though I have yet to hear a car stereo with better sound clarity.  

Driving the LS400 is enjoyable, though the cost of maintaining the car has increased over the years.  Parts don't wear out very often, but those that do wear out are expensive to replace.  

Our LS400 is equipped with the optional air ride suspension - an interesting yet mostly useless option.  Conversely, the optional traction control system has been very useful in winter driving.  

One other note: tall drivers should make sure that the optional sunroof does not limit their headroom in the vehicle - being 6''3 I must recline the seat backrest to prevent rubbing my head on the roof of the car.
