            <i>Note:  This is a review of my cute little 1987 Honda Civic Wagovan, but I couldn't find that exact car on this site.  So be it.</i>

I had not owned a car for almost two years before I bought this one, so I was bound to love the thing.  It gets me around, what more could I ask for?  It was also cheap as heck at $750.  So cheap that I learned how to drive standard just to buy it!  Shucks, I'd probably love it even if it were a total hunk of junk and broke down every other day.  But let me tell ya brother, that is not the case at all.

I have had absolutely <i>NO</i> problems with this car and have owned it going on three months.  I even drove it all the way to Boston, MA and back (to Columbus, OH - about a 13 hour drive one way).  It stands at a little over 140K miles now.  Hard to believe, but it's true I tell ya.  No problems at all.

Well, ok, I do stall the damn thing about once every other day, but that's just because I am still getting used to driving standard ;)

<b>The Body</b>

It is an ugly gold color that my girlfriend hates (doncha honey?) but she sure doesn't hate the fact that the car allows me to come over to her place.  It is also square as square can be.  But like I said, looks be damned.  It is a four-door.  The body is in surprisingly good condition for its sixteen years, just a little rust around the wheel wells and the bases of the doors.  The trunk doesn't stay open, but I have a nifty little set up with a pair of vise grips that helps me out there.  Also, the driver's side door doesn't lock unless you pull out the handle at the same time.  Big Deal!

<b>Interior</b>

A big advantage for a musician like myself is that the back seat folds down providing an enormous space for hauling my gear.  There are no tears in the seats, and it feels comfortable enough.  The visibility when you are drivning is excellent: there is virtually no blind spot.

<b>Sound System and other accessories</b>

Pooey!  All I have is a radio which becomes impossible to hear when I'm driving down the highway with the window's open (no A/C).  But think about it: you buy a car to go places, not to be entertained. Likewise, the cigarette lighter doesn't work.  Boo-freakin-hoo.  Smoking is bad for you anyway.

<b>Handling</b>

It drives very well and can fit into the tiniest parking spots (although it takes me a while to park, what with the whole driving stick thing that I have not mastered.  I'm getting there...)  It does take a while to "warm up" the first time you drive it each day...the RPMs sit around 2200 until the car settles in, but that only takes a couple of minutes.  I have had it up to 90 a few times, but it started to shake like a frightened little school girl.  But the rest of the time, it is like a big bold school master.

<b>Mileage</b>

It gets around 25 miles/gallon.  Not great, but definitely good.

<b>This and That</b>

There is a crack in the windshield.  Oh well.  I had to replace a tail light.  Darn.  It really is a butt ugly car but I just don't care (too much).  I'm on the road again!
