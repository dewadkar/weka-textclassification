            I bought this camera for $180 with a $100 rebate so I got a pretty good deal for it at the time(2 years ago).  The image quality is about as good as you can expect for a 850k CCD.  It outputs 1024x768 images that are pretty sharp for the right lighting conditions and distance from the camera.  The LCD eats up the battery pretty fast which makes it practically unusable while you are taking the pictures.  If you don't use the LCD, you can make the battery last quite a while though.  The viewfinder is slightly larger than the area that the camera actually captures, so you have to check that you are getting the picture that you want sometimes or you might end up chopping off some heads or something.  The macro and TV-out functions are kind of nice.  The serial transfer is slow.  I bought a 32 meg card and can store over 200 pictures on it.  The flash makes it a bit difficult to put in your pocket and you need the flash for indoor shots.  Also, mine crashes sometimes and doesn't respond and won't turn off(which is very odd for a camera), but if you just pop the battery out, it works fine again.  Also, the camera doesn't come with a lens cap and the lens is recessed so it is difficult to clean.  You also can't attach any other lenses or anything to it.  Color reproduction is good.  Long story short, its a good camera for snapshots but not for once-in-a-lifetime pictures.
