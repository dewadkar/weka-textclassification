            I have liked the Blazer since its inception in the mid 80's.  I had wanted one after I was married.  Now that I have one, I may never buy another brand of vehicle.  I have been in Explorers and Suburbans and anything else SUV except the Dodge Durango.  I can honestly tell you that the Blazer (mine is a '98 LS) is the smoothest ride of them.  Larger vehicles are good for storage and hauling but do not provide smooth ride.  Inside interior is nice and big.  Bigger than it  looks on the outside.  Again, if you need hauling and large loads or families of 6 or more, go bigger.  A family of 4 can ride comfortably and a 5th is no problem.  Everything is close at hand from the drivers seat and my LS model has the temp and direction.  (Don't laugh, it actually saved me once.)  Reasonably priced for an SUV, however, be prepared, the SUV market is heading out of control.  2000 Blazer LS with ONstar is now $28,000.  Gas mileage is 24 Hwy and 20 in town but the gas tank is small (16-18 gal)  Fill up a lot if you commute.<br><br>
