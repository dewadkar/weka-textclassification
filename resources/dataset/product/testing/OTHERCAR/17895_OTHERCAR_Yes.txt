            I bought this car slightly under 3 years ago, and it has performed well everyday of that time period.  Never once had it seen the mechanic, for more then the typical oil change or slight service.  The 2000, which i traded in for this year, is every bit as good, and better.  The new grille adds to its overall classy style.  The engine is terrific.  The plush interior makes it a perfect car for a business person, a couple, or an entire family.  The only small downside to it is the  gas mileage.  However, this is only a very small downside.  Most cars in its class are very close to the same.  <br><br>
