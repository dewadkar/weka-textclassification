            Okay, so maybe Will Smith wasn't driving a Nissan Sentra in his R&amp;B/Rap song Summertime, but it's not that boring...really.  

Tall Dark and Handsome? If you want that from the Nissan family you need the Maxima.  Great looks, powerful, a real head-turner...not this car.  Not all of us get to have the fantasy come true, so we settle for the Short, Cute and Stable types; thus, the Sentra.

It's not a big car, but it's not the size that counts, right? It's fairly roomy for little car.  There's plenty of trunk space to lug my horse junk all over town and still comfortably seat four.  

It's not fast and powerful, but, with that type of car you just can't always count on it to be there when you need it, and it's likely to be stolen away from you.  With the Sentra, you don't have to worry about that.

It's not lavish.  But It's practical.  With 40 mpg there's still money left for life's other pleasures.

What's that they say.....you can tell a lot about a person from the car they drive?  <br><br>
