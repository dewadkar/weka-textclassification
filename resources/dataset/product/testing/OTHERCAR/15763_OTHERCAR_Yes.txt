<TEXT>
            About a year ago I bought a fairly modest 1992 Cherokee Sport. No power windows or locks, no mirrored visors, and no leather interior to speak of. The air conditioning is slow to kick in and quick to cut out. The ash tray is missing, the spare tire squeaks, and there are more cigarette burns than I could count with both sets of fingers.

But let me tell you something:

She�s yet to give up.

Never once has she stalled leaving me stranded or refused to start in the first place. She�s never been stuck in snow, mud, or flown out of control on ice. The engine is never too hot, the oil is never too dirty, and she doesn�t complain when I fill her with cheap gasoline. She�s a joy to drive and a pleasure to own.

I couldn�t give a higher recommendation.<br><br>
