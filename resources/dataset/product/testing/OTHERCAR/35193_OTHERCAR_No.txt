            I have had so many problems since I purchased a new 1998 Range Rover SE 4.0L I would think twice, or three times before accepting one if it was being given to me.

I had heard many bad stories but honestly believed that the takeover by BMW would have seen a significant increase in quality. Was I ever wrong?

And if anything has been more disappointing than the terrible build and reliability, it has been the attitude to of Land Rover to Customer Service, or lack of it.

I think if any one issue highlights the problems, it is why do Land Rovers in the UK get a 3 year, 60,000 mile warranty, where as the exact same vehicle in Australia or the USA only get 2years and 50,000kms?

In Australia, Toyotas' and Nissans' get 3 years, 100,000km warranty as standard.

My understanding from informed sources is that there are only 2 places in the world where 4WD vehicles are truly tested to their limits...Australia and the USA!
