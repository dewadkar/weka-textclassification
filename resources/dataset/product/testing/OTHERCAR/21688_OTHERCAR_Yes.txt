            I bought my slightly used 1998 Chevrolet Prizm LSI a year and a half ago from my local Chevy dealer.  I am happy to say that I have not had any problems whatsoever since I bought it.  It gets great gas mileage, looks great and is very peppy and fun to drive.  It is a very solid car, handles well and has many extra features such as cruise control, power windows and locks, keyless entry, air conditioning, stereo cassette, fold-down rear seat to enlarge the trunk area and velour interior.  There are several convenient storage areas in the console, doors and on the dashboard as well as pockets behind the front seats.  I would recommend this car to anyone who is looking for a dependable, economical, family car.<br><br>
