            If you're reading this, the you fall into one of two categories:
1. You own a Volkswagen Passat and you're wondering if others love their machine as much as you do.
2. You're looking to buy a car, and you're wondering if this is the right car.

If you fall into the first category-- great. I too love my car (affectionately named Merlin). If you're in the second group, you'll realize that Passat owners are a relatively loyal bunch who aren't ashamed to brag a little. Here's my experience.

This was my first new car purchase. Bigger than the Jetta (and Audi A4) and seating four comfortably, Merlin was supposed to drive me to work everyday. He does that admirably, chugging through city street with a flick of the shifter, and eating up highway at 30+ MPG.

I'll be the first to admit-- if you're looking for a super car, this isn't it. The Passat doesn't go 0-60 faster than a Dodge Viper, it doesn't save fuel like a Geo Metro, and I would gladly swap Merlin for a Rolls-Royce anyday (sorry). But at slightly over 22K, it's got everything you need, A/C, trip computer, huge trunk, comfort, and indigo night lamps -- and some stuff that you don't-- why does anyone need a climate controlled glovebox?

The downsides- it's classified as a Family Car (ewww!) Not something that a 24 yr wants his car to be classified as.  Passats are driven by everyone from college students to retirees. However, I will admit that Merlin comes in handy when impressing the ladies- leather seats, blue lights and a big VW moniker everywhere. How could anyone say no? 

All in all - I love the Passat. Now if anyone wants to trade their Rolls-Royce...<br><br>
