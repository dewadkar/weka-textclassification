               After my lease on a Jeep Cherokee was up in 1999, I was ready for a vehicle that was worth my money.  Before my jeep lease, I owned a 1986 Blazer.  It was my first vehicle, and I missed it dearly.  I looked at the chevy blazer that I now own and was sold on it from the minute that I test drove it.  The body style is great and I am very satisfied with the roomy interior.  I am 6' tall and was very comfortable as far as leg room and head room.  The back seat is easy to get in and out of (not so in my last car).  The seats are easily operated to fold down for carrying larger items.  It seats five people with comfort.  I have had my Blazer for one full year now and I have no complaints.  It has never been back in the shop.
   Gas mileage is a factor when purchasing a new vehicle.  I get about 250  miles per tank.  Not bad for driving around town.  I do very little interstate driving.  But with any SUV or truck, you are going to give up the luxury of better gas mileage.  I do not think that it is terribly bad.
   Two months after I bought my Blazer, another one was brought into the family.  My parents loved mine so much that they bought one as well.
   Our driveway consists of 4 vehicles.  One Chevy Z-71 pick up, two Chevy Blazers and a Lincoln Continental.  The Lincoln is on it's last leg and it will be replaced with a Chevy product when the time comes.  We have had no complaints.
