              One of the most basic reasons of buying this car is the same as buying any other car, I needed a car. My trusted Ply. Reliant had served it's purpose by giving me 150,000 miles and a couple of slot machines at Atlantic City donated a few thousand bucks to make the financing easier. Much easier, I paid cash. 11,800 is what I gave the dealer on this blue beauty. he asked for 13,990 being it was used and had 3,793 miles on it. Said the previous owner buys a new car every year and hardly puts any miles on any car because they are an elderly couple who never go anywhere except to church on Sunday. Boy was i lucky to find such a bargain. Did you ever hear of such a thing. Wow I jumped at it! However it is possible I jumped too soon and too far.
  I have had this 99 chevy cavalier for six months and have had the car recalled three times. Once was for heated hose shield another was for some seal around the tranny for owners who live near salt water and something about a spark plug wire that causes a lite to go on, on the dash board. All has been taken care of compliments of General Motors.
  Now I am ready to sing along with Dinah Shore and see the U.S.A. in my chevrolet. I have jotted down the gas consumption at 28- 31 miles to the gallon. When I bought the car gas was about $1.10 a gallon now it's about
1.89 so I can't say it is a gas guzzler the opec nations are.As far as comfort goes I pretty much believe a car is to get you from point A to point B no to give you a foot massage as your driving. So I'll rate this auto as very comfortable for trips back and forth from Atlantic City (100 miles ) a longer trip is being planned and a report will follow. The radio
I feel is a Marconi original. There are only three audible stations which require constant kicking and banging for proper tuning. No signs of oil burning,that's a good thingy. Rides slightly primative, kind of like a Conastooga. A little bump here a little bump there, a little rattle here a little rattle there. It might be a bit pre mature but I think I am going to get my money's worth from this baby. Not quite as tight as Uncle Scrooge but tight enough.  happy motoring!!!!!<br><br>
