            I have been driving Jeeps for years.  I started out on a CJ7 when I first started driving.  It was a great truck, and it was different to see on the road (when Jeeps weren't nearly as trendy).  It drove like a truck, and its offroading potential was fantastic.  The part that i most liked about it was that the interior was no frills.  Very simple and rugged.  Jeeps have come a long way since then, with some good changes as well as bad ones.

First off, I will say that the overall highway/city driving experience in the Jeep has improved a lot.  It is a lot smoother ride overall.  The engine is almost exactly the same.  Jeep has been using this engine in their cars for years.  It has plenty of power and acceleration.  The Wrangler now has a five speed manual instead of a four speed.  Again to improve highway driving.  The Wrangler corners well, although if you take a corner too tight and too fast you may feel a bit unstable.  The one thing that is GREAT about the Wrangler is how tight you can turn.  U-turns are a cinch!  Steering is tight and responsive.  Off roading to is the same as older models of Jeeps, and its high clearance still leaves many SUVs in its dust.

The interior of the Jeep is where my complaints are centered.  I realize that Chrysler wants to sell as many of these as they can, but couldn't they have at least some things intact?  I have watched as the interior of the Wrangler has slowly become identical of a regular car.  Pure rubbish if you ask me!  The great thing about the CJ5, CJ7, and the older Wranglers was the rustic feel.  You could wash out the inside of the car with little care for what would get wet or dirty.  It was a utilitarian's car.  Now the interior is almost identical to that of my Cherokee.  Bring back the levers!  I also liked the placement of the emergency brake when it was on the floor instead of the console.  Seating is not the most comfortable thing in the world, but then again this is a Jeep.  You are not going to get all the frills of a car (at least not yet).

One huge improvement that has taken forever to evolve is the soft top on the Wrangler.  Every year it seems that Chrysler has tried something different!  The new top is so much easier than the older Jeeps.  My old CJ7 used buckles and bands to keep it on tight.  Now the top basically just flips up and latches on in little time.  Believe me that this is very important when you are stuck in a sudden thunderstorm.  

Overall, the Wrangler is still a great SUV and a lot of fun.  When compared to other cars it definitely deserves a four.  In comparison to older Jeep models it barely scores a three.  And for heaven sakes get it in stick!<br><br>
