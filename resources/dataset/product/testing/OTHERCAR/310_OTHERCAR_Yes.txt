            I purchased an Xterra when they originally were released and owned it for one year before trading it in on for a new car.  The decision to sell it had nothing to do with any failings of the Xterra... I just switched to longer commute and decided that the Xterra no longer made fuel economy sense.  

Some things I really liked about the Xterra:
. Price.  The Xterra is a great bargain compared to SUV's of similar quality and power.
. Offroad performance: I wanted to be able to do some serious offroading.  Many of the current SUV's (the Pathfinder and its unibody constructionis a great example of this) are designed for on-road drivers.  That probably makes sense for a lot of SUV owners, most of which will spend more time navigating potholes than dirt paths.  But the XTerra, built off the Frontier's chassis, is very capable offroad.  
. Feel.  This is a far more subjective feeling... you'll need to drive the truck yourself and make your own call... but personally I was very happy with the on-road feel of the Xtrerra and the overall quality of the truck.  The truck just had a better road feel, and sense of quality in general, then the Pathfinder, Explorer, and Rodeo (all of which I drove to compare it with).  
. Quality.  Granted, I only owned the truck for a year, but I didn't have any problems with it.  Period.  

What I didn't like about the Xterra are really just problems with SUV's in general.  While the road handling was good for an SUV, it's hardly comparable to any non-suvs.  And it takes a lot of gas... difficult to justify if you do long commutes with no or few passengers or cargo.

I bought the fully loaded Xterra, which I think is worth it.  The larger engine is apporiate for the truck, and the accessories are all genuinely useful (the Xterra doesn't have the same sort of luxury frills in other SUV's... which is something I appreciate).  This was the first automatic transition I've owned, since I genuinly prefer sticks, but you get more traction control and pulling ability with the automatic trasmission in the Xtrerra... it's also a very smooth and reasonably &quot;intelligent&quot; automatic system.  

If you're sure that an SUV  fits your driving needs, then I'd recommend the XTerra.  If you want more specifics about offroad ability, you may want to check out the Xterra owner's club on Yahoo.  They have regular club meetings in different states for offroad excursions and information on different accessories and modifications for the truck.
