            Our family has had two Dodge/Plymouth Grand sized vans which were good vehicles and served us well through days of hockey bags and kids friends. We were looking to downsize, but not ready to give up the 7 people capacity. The stylish looks of this 2000 MPV caught our attention. We wanted something with a sun/moon roof. The Honda or Chrysler vans don't offer this unless you pay the high price of the Chrysler Town and Country van. The Mazda MPV comes in three models, DX - LX and ES, but only the top model 'ES' comes with this feature. It also added a few other options as standard in the ES level -- ABS, 16&quot; alloy wheels, tinted glass all around, leather seats and steering wheel with wood-tone trim dash and a CD changer that takes 6 CD's into a single slot in the dashboard. This is a great option as you can change CD's while you are up front. The speaker system in the ES is also very high quality, with nine speakers (includes a sub-woofer). If you were to add up these options, they make the ES decision fairly easy to justify if you are after only one or two of these added options. I am very impressed with the interior finish on the dash and doors. They are much higher quality than what we have been used to in the Dodge/Plymouth vans. The leather seats are not soft leather, but still look good. Only the seat surface is leather, and the sides are exact matching materials but upon close examination, they have a slightly different feel. No one would notice unless they read the fine print in the brochure on the leather seating option.

Driving this vehicle is very enjoyable. The thick leather steering wheel feels great. The seat adjustments (albeit manual) can be well tailored including a height adjustment. The controls are all easily reached, and the controls for the radio/CD changer are large and easy to set while driving. Lots of cup holders and even large bottle holders are present. Passengers like this vehicle, as the mid seats slide together to form a bench, or slide apart to become individual bucket style seats (like the Honda Odyssey). The rear seat is a 3 seat bench and it folds down into a well in the back storage area of the van, to give you a flat bed for cargo. This also similar to the Honda Odyssey. (PS The Honda Odyssey is similar in size to the Grand Caravan's and also costs more that the MPV). Mazda has done a great job of maximizing the interior space in this van by putting the spare tire under the van in the middle of the undercarriage. Another unique feature is the rear windows in the sliding doors go down. The air conditioning unit has rear controls for the very back seating area, which is another nice feature as it can get hotter back there than in the front.

We were not expecting people to stare at this vehicle, being a van, but it is amazing how many looks it continues to get. This may also be partly due to the fact that ours was one of the first ones out as we took delivery on July 31/99. We now have just under 5000 km on it so it will soon be due for its first scheduled service. The only adjustment we have found so far is a grease mark appears on the drivers side window after raising and lowering it a few times.

The only complaints I point out are that the engine is a bit underpowered when taking off or climbing a large hill. Although it has more horsepower than our Dodge van had, it is not as fast from a dead stop. This is not a major issue, as it is still respectable enough, but I do notice it jumps between gears when beginning to climb a big hill. This could be overcome if you were to move the shift lever into 2nd gear. The other complaint I have is that there is a lot of wind noise when the moonroof is open. The air deflector has 3 cutout slots that let air into the van, and these create excessive noise. The dealer has agreed that I am not the first to complain about this, and he said they would be bringing a plastic roof deflector out in mid-November that would fix the problem (about $100). The only other mention is that 6 people fit great and 7 for short trips, but I would not want to be a on a long trip with 3 people on the rear seat, as it is not as wide as the larger vans.

Overall, if you want a van that is easy to park or maneuver in the city, that can handle up to 7 people, and well priced for the features you get, I can highly recommend the 2000 Mazda MPV.<br><br>
