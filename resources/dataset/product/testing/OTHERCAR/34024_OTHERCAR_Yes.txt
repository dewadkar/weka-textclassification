            I purchased this camera about 6 months ago from some obscure online retailer for about $350. I had looked in retail stores to play around with it and see what it had to offer and was very pleased, so I bought it! I looked at other brands in the same price range, but I was very impressed with the Canon.  My applications are both for fun and for business. I use the camera to take pictures of real estate for my business and I use the camera all the time when on vacation or out and about. I tend to take mostly landscape/outdoor pictures, but I do take some action photos, portraits and like to step into some more advanced photo techniques and I needed a camera that could make the transition to each type of shot and the S30 does that very well.

PROS:
-------------
This camera has all the options and features that you could ever need. Manual adjustment of every conceivable function lets you take brilliant photos; many different effects such as sepia and B&W can make you look like a pro using equipment several times what you paid for this baby. I find myself leaving the camera in program mode, which is a point-n-shoot on steroids mode that finds the optimal shutter speed and aperature for the situation, along with determining the proper white balance. I rarely use the auto mode since it's just not worth it with a camera that can do so much. The action mode does a great job of capturing the moment with super fast shutter speeds and the outdoor/landscape mode works very well. I'm aspiring to be more than just a point and shoot photographer and I feel this camera has more than enough functions to allow me to dabble into more professional photography when I want to, yet has a very easy to use interface and powerful "basic" camera settings that make it a fun point-n-shoot camera when you don't want to mess around. The write time between shots is very fast and I have never had a time where I was waiting for it to finish when I wanted to take a shot. The startup is super fast, too. Several other cameras I looked at took what seemed like an eternity before it was ready to start taking pictures. I always use the LCD screen when taking pictures not just because it's HUGE and gives you all the information about a shot that you'll need, but because the viewfinder does not show the entire picture you're about to take...I think it only does like 83%, which really does make a difference when you look at the picture in the screen after you take it.

Rock solid. This thing is heavy and solid. The whole thing is made of metal, and it looks killer.  I've dropped it a couple times and it shows no sign of damage or malfunction. For some, it may be too heavy to lug around as an everyday camera, but I find that the extra few ounces is trivial in the grand scheme of "user fatigue" and a HUGE asset when it gets banged around or dropped. If you're going to pay this much for a camera, do you really want something plastic that feels like it could be a disposable digicam??

Photo quality genuinely amazed me. I always use the highest resolution and the largest picture size (which you should always do if you ever plan on printing) and it is fantastic. I read several professional reviews discussing things I had no idea existed like "pin-cushioning" and got rather confused. So, I did what every Joe-Blow does to evaluate how well a camera takes photos: I took some photos and I had them printed. The photos I got back (from dotPhoto.com) were like regular 35mm prints, period. I gave some to a friend and she had no idea they were taken with a digital camera. I usually only print 4x6's but I have complete confidence that I could print 8x10's and larger and not worry about degredation of quality. My photos always tend to be a bit underexposed or on the dim side, but a little digital darkroom work fixes that every time.

The software that comes with the S30 is adequate and does a fine job. I especially like the stitch assist program; I've captured a few stunning panoramas thanks to that program. I use the Canon Zoom Browser to download the photos quickly and using a TON less RAM than my photo editing program. However, I purchased a simple media USB drive and I now transfer the files to my computer that way, but the USB cable that came with the camera works just as fine...be careful if you're running low on batteries as the picture transfer can chew up the battery pretty quickly if you have a lot of photos.

Another big selling point for me was rechargable battery packs. The battery life is very good and lets me do what I need to without having to recharge or buy new batteries every 20 minutes. I'd never buy a digital that uses standard batteries...big hassle and you'll never stop buying batteries for as long as you own it. If you buy a spare battery, there's no reason you couldn't spend a whole day shooting and editing.

The movie mode is cool, but it was not a major factor when buying this camera. I've taken a few movies and they come out very nice, but I never go out of my way to shoot movies. Nice to have if the need arises, though.

CONS:
-------------
This camera has a TON of features. You can get rather confused when in the field, especially if the moment catches you and you need to act quickly. Messing with the exposure, flash exposure/compensation and white balance (to name just a few) can take some time and effort. I've never read the manual from cover to cover, but I think I will need to (as you probably will too) in order to get what I want out of the camera. My biggest problem has come when using the "night" mode on the camera. Your subjects had better stay still for a while and you better have the steady hands of a surgeon when it fires the multiple flashes. I'm sure that if I read more about the function I'd understand how exactly it works, but about 90% of my shots at night don't come out because everything is blurry. Of course, I could simply use the flash in "program" mode, but I've found that the flash can really drown out a photo if you don't manually adjust the exposure...another problem that I'm sure I could fix by reading the book thoroughly or learning a bit more about photography. In short, it's not so much a CON with the camera, more of just a "oh man, I need to read the book??!!" complaint. I gladly accept that there is some kind of learning curve as it's expected with a camera that has SO many functions and settings. If you're looking for a point-n-shoot, look elsewhere and save a lot of money and frustration in the process.

CONCLUSION:
--------------
I'm very happy with my purchase and I think this camera is a great buy for amateurs and wannabe shutterbugs out there. Once you read the book and get the features and functions down, this camera will perform just as well as cameras well above its price range.
