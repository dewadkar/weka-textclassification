            The end must be near. Cadillac and Lincoln are both building pick-up trucks. Are people really that thrilled with trucks?  Let Toyota, Chevy and Ford make the trucks � Lincoln should stick to luxury cars. Critics say the Blackwood is nothing more than an F-150 Crew Cab  with some fancy wood work thrown on.  While it may be true that the Blackwood IS related mechanically more to an F-150 than any luxury car, its execution is all Lincoln. Like it or not, the Luxury SUV market is here to stay, Lincoln�s Blackwood is only trying to fit in.

The Blackwood�s exterior is nothing if not striking, the rear part of the truck has a dark wood grain look to it (hence the name BLACKwood) but it�s difficult to see unless in direct sunlight. There are subtle chrome accents, and the exterior is finished off nicely with great looking 7-spoke alloy wheels.  Although not a particularly attractive design overall, you�ve got to give Lincoln credit where credit is due. The rear most part of the truck is good looking, and earns praise mostly for its attention to detail. The large, power bed cover has a very nice Lincoln logo on it � in fact the bed cover looks a bit like an old Lincoln car hood with a nice hood ornament. The rear �French door� treatment also lends a bit of class to the bed. 

The interior of the Blackwood is just as luxurious as the exterior, four captains chairs and a nice looking wood steering wheel stand out. Also the inside of the cargo area, or truck bed, whichever you think sounds best, is also nicely detailed. Stainless steel sides and two light strips lining the plush carpet give one the distinct feeling a Blackwood owner could win second place at the Placer County Fair car stereo show. The cargo area is essentially a big trunk, and no reasonable person would consider using it as a pick-up. The power operated cargo cover is not removable. If you want to haul bricks or fertilizer or hay � the Blackwood is not for you.

Styling is subjective, one person may hate the garish, wannbe rap video styling, while another may praise the classy and striking silhouette.  The one thing that is not subjective is ride quality. Despite the Blackwood�s luxury intentions, the ride is anything but luxurious. On the open highway or uneven pavement, the Blackwood feels noticeably truck-like. For $52,000 the ride quality should be improved. On the other hand, the Blackwood�s firm ride does result in better than average handling.  The driving position is also very odd, the driver feels as if he or she is sitting at the most forward portion of the vehicle, with quite a long train following. Perhaps this is due the Blackwood�s 220.2 inch overall length.  Interior noise levels are slightly above what most of us have come to expect from Lincoln automobiles. 

Acceleration is brisk. That�s no surprise given the Lincoln DOHC, 32-valve V8 engine that comes standard on all Blackwoods.  The 5.4 liter V8 makes an impressive 300 hp, and it delivers that power with relative smoothness.  Again, there seems to be lack of refinement given the hefty price tag most Blackwood owners will pay.  

As stated earlier, the Blackwood�s interior looks as if it belongs in a luxury car.  There is plenty of storage space up front in the form of a cavernous center console storage bin. However, much of that space can quickly be eaten up by optional equipment such as the navigation system. A navigation system and CD changer whittle the front storage space down to sunglasses, a wallet and maybe a few CDs.  The rear passengers have an even larger storage compartment, but it�s hard to get to from the front seats. Speaking of the front seats, they are not very comfortable, in fact they feel rock hard. Transplanting the seats from a Town Car would do wonders for the quality of time spent behind the big Lincoln�s wood and leather wrapped steering wheel. Somehow the rear seats are softer and more luxurious than the front.  On the positive side, the front seats are heated and cooled. That�s right, cooled seats.  The Blackwood�s front seats have small perforations, and when desired, cold air can be passed through them.  It�s the perfect feature for an all black car in the middle of summer. Other high points inside the Blackwood include a killer stereo system, a nicely laid out dash, and steering wheel mounted audio, climate and cruise controls.

Overall, the Blackwood is such a niche vehicle that it barely seems fair to compare it to other cars or trucks.  Yet one can�t help but expect true, Lexus like luxury at a sticker price of over $50,000. The truth is, most people who will buy a Blackwood care about one thing � image. It�s an image car. The Blackwood is different and it will get you noticed (should you need that kind of thing). It�s not the ultimate, or perfect luxury car. It�s not even all that luxurious.  The Blackwood is certainly not a bad car/truck, but neither is it extraordinary. Here is the bottom line: if you want a Blackwood because of its novelty and uniqueness, you will not be disappointed. However, if you are expecting the Blackwood to be the one car that gives you the level of luxury, convenience, refinement, and utility found in other $50,000 SUVs, keep looking.
