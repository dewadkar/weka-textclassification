            Bought my first car in '48. After 30 cars including Cadillac, Lincoln, Oldsmobile, Chrysler, De Soto, Plymouths, Fords, Austin, MG, Morris, Fiats, Datsun, Chevvies, Dodge, Oldsmobile, and perhaps one or two I've forgotten I was very pleasantly surprised with the Accent GS Hatchback. I simply cannot understand how they've made this car at the low price. I drove the lowest priced cars from Kia, Daewoo, Ford, chevvie, Suzuki, and Oldsmobile then read a review on-line of the 2000 Accent. I had to drive about thirty miles to a dealer for a test-drive and I was sold. The quiet, the handling, the room and seating, the smooth automatic transmission, and the braking sold me. So I bought one. I now have eight hundred miles on this machine. I've been retired for over twenty years and spent a lot of money on boats during those retired years so that I now have to buy an economy car. I really believe I chose the right one! <br><br>
