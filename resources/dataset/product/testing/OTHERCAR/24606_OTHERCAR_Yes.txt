            When I turned 16 I inherited my mom's 1994 Toyota Tercel.  It's a four speed manual transmission.  I think this is one of the better little cars out there.  My car is only seven years old and it has over 125,000 miles on it.  It's been to Florida and back several times and runs just as well in the hot weather as it does in the cold.  Until recently I have had very little trouble with it.  The clutch disk needs replacing, and it idles a bit roughly, but then again it was abused by my mother who used it to deliver papers which requires constant stop and go driving - not good for a stick shift.  Overall, it handles fairly well, and has excellent gas mileage (about 40 mpg on the highway and 35 mpg around town).  If you're looking for a used car I'd say the 94 Tercel is a sound choice.<br><br>
