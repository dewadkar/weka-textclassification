            I will not bore everyone with the technical details and features on this camera.  The other reviewers cover this in detail.  I am an amature photographer at best.  I have 2 small kids and I want to take good pictures that I can easily get onto my PC.

So, here are the questions that I like to know when I am looking for a digital camera:

How is the picture quality?

A: GREAT!  Our pictures come out sharp with great color!  We have used the camera in low light, sunlight, indoors and out.  We keep it on auto and 98% of the shots are perfect!

How fast is the camera?

A: This is the #1 question people should be asking when they are buying a digital camera!  ESPECIALLY if you have small kids that don't stand still for pictures!!!  With all of the other digital cameras my wife and I have used, we had missed about 70% of the shots we wanted because the camera was too slow.  

There are 2 things to worry about here:

Shutter lag:  From the time you press the button to the time the shutter captures the picture.  On ALL other cameras, this was too slow.  Our kids would move or turn their heads before the stupid camera took the picture! 

The Sony F707 is VERY quick in this respect!

The other thing to worry about is...

Buffer lag:  The time it takes for the camera to get the picture it just took to the memory card so you can take another picture.

With the other cameras we used, we could not take a second or third picture immediatly after the first because the camera had to "process" the first picture and save it to the memory card.

The Sony F707 allows you to take 3 pictures, one right after the other VERY quickly.  In fact, it is so fast that we have not notices any limit to the number of pictures we can take in sequence.  By the time we want to take the 4th picture, the camera has already saved the 1st to the memory card!

How long does the battery last?

A:  L O N G ! ! !   Wow, the battery is AMAZING!!!!  We took the camera to Disney World and the battery EASILY lasted 2 days with HEAVY picture taking and with the SCREEN ON!!!!  No other camera comes close!!!

So, the things I have mentioned above are the things that this Sony does really well, and other cameras do really poorly.

The Sony has all the other bells and whistles:  Easy to use, many features, takes good movies, high quality, etc.

I HIGHLY recommend this camera!!!!

What else I have I owned and sold on ebay?

Nikon 5000 - BIG disappointment!!!!
Nikon 995
Olympus 3000
Casio w/Megadrive
Fugi

... Many others that I can't even remember...
