                 I purchased a 1990 Plymouth Acclaim new in 1990.  I was one of the worse cars I ever owned.  It spent more time in the shop than it did on the road.  The repair shop knew me by name.  It had transmission problems, had to have a new one.  Electrical problems.  Many were not ever repaired.  They could find it, or get it to repeat at the repair shop.  It left me on the side of the road.  I had it towed from my driveway, the side of the road, and other exciting places.  The car look nice, and when it was running, it ran smooth.  When it was down, it was down and out.  I was glad to get rid of it.<br><br>
