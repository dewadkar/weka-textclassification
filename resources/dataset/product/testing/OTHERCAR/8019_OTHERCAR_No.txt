            We bought our van brand new off the lot.  Shortly thereafter the brakes began making loud squealing noises which Chrysler explained with a Service Bulletin explaining that this is common with all their models due to the type of brake pad used.  Well we waited until the brakes wore out, which was sooner than expected and had them redone.  They remained quiet for about 20,000 miles, when they wore out again.  We've spent about $700 in brake jobs so far.  In the fall of last year the van needed to be towed to the dealer due to it wouldn't start.  When I opened the hood I noticed smoke coming from the positive side battery cable.  It seems that due cable was poorly crimped and over time began to break off causing and intermittent connection, sparks and smoke.  Well the dealer explained it as poor maintenance and wouldn't cover the repair.  My 6yr/100,000 mile warranty wouldn't cover it either because batteries are not covered and the cable is connected to the battery.  Even though the warranty covers "all wiring harnesses" and the only way to properly repair this was to replace the entire engine wiring harness at a cost of $500.  Well the dealer "did me a favor" and rigged up a jumper around the connection for the mere sum of $175 ($25 parts, $150 labor).  This brings me to today and I had to have the van towed to the dealer again for the exact same symptoms as last fall (without the smoke).  Like other comments I have read, I too have had the mysterious wiper turning on problem

UPDATE:  Well it turned out to be a dead battery.  That makes three 5 year dealer batteries in 4 years.  The dealer doesn't seem to be concerned about it at all.  So $175 (the first 2 were covered under the warranty vehicles 3/30,000 warranty so the 5 year battery warranty doesn't count) later I have another 5 year battery.  And just to rub it in they wanted me to okay replacing the plugs and wires for another $200.  I think you now where I told them to stick their plugs.  Now I've noticed that the Air Bag Idiot Light stays on all the time, and the Cruise Control and Horn have quit.  The dealer doesn't see any reason why this all may be related.  They are willing to charge me a $85 diagnostic fee if I am willing to wait two weeks for the next available appointment.
