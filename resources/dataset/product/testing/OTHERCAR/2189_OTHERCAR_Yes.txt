            For those of you looking for a car or just can't decide which car to buy, I would definitely recommend the Toyota Corolla!

I think it is the most reliable car made today, and we still have our Toyota Corolla from 1985!!  It is still running and in all those years we have not really had any trouble with it at all. My family and I always felt safe going on really long road trips across the U.S. and tracking across Europe with it!

The air conditioning is still working after all these years and we never replaced it and the radio works too.  The only thing that is now giving us a little trouble after all these years is our manual windows.  All the upholstery is fine and the paint and frame are good, too.  

I can't tell you how much we have enjoyed our Toyota Corolla and are still enjoying it.  If you want a good deal that will last a while and a car that is reliable, then this is the car to go with!

Hope this helped.  Please let me know!
