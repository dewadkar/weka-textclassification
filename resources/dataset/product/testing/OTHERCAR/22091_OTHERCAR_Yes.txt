               I never thought about buying a digital camera until my brother brought his home for the holidays.  He bought a Canon PowerShot A50 after reviewing the quality of several cameras (the DC 215 wasn�t one that he reviewed).  Due to his experience I was able to make an educated decision during my research.  <i> (Below are the accessories and special features of the DC215) </i>

<b> DC215 FLAWS </b>

  After taking a picture that appears centered you realize there is a slight disparity with the alignment of the camera.  This isn't a major flaw but takes some getting used to for effective compensation when taking pictures.  The Camera takes poor pictures if you don't use the best resolution when taking them (keep it on high quality).

<i> &lt;TIP&gt; By keeping the center of you picture slightly to the left this can be overcome. </i>

<b> MY PRICE RANGE </b>

   The first thing I had to consider was price, I couldn�t afford the top of the line Sony but I wanted one where the pictures looked like pictures with no distortion.   I decided that I wanted to spend about $450.00 for the whole camera package.

<b> MY QUALITY RANGE </b>

   Next I had to be practical about the sizes of the images that I wanted 8 x 6 (800 x 600) resolution was slightly above low end and might distort if I wanted to print it at 8.5 x 11 (864 x 1152).  What I decided that I could live with was the 8.5 x 11 as this seemed to be about the average size of the pictures hanging on the walls of my house.

<i> &lt;NOTE:&gt; You'll probably have to tweak the picture to get a good print above 5 x 7 </i>

<b> ADVICE FOR SHOPPING </b>

   After setting the price and limitations on the picture size I asked my brother what he liked and disliked about his camera.  His camera was very nice and supported a higher resolution then the DC215 (needless to say this is one thing he liked).  He also liked the fact that his camera used Compact flash cards for storing the pictures (I explain this below).  However, he was upset over how quickly the camera used up batteries and said he would not buy his camera again because it used a proprietary camera battery that had a cost of $13.00 every time he needed one and it was not easy to find.  

<i> &lt;TIP&gt; If you decide to buy a camera with a proprietary battery check to make sure it's one of the most common batteries </i>

<b> MEMORY TECHNOLOGIES </b> <i> (can make or break the camera) </i>

   The final part to finding my range of cameras was in the memory technology.  There are currently 3 types of memory cards that are being supported in digital cameras.

�Smartmedia
�Compact Flash
�Sony Memory sticks

  The Smartmedia memory used different voltages per size, which meant not every Smartmedia card worked with every Smartmedia based camera.  Another knock against Smartmedia is the maximum size you can buy is currently limited to a 64 Meg card (remember if not voltage compatible then you may be stuck at 16 Megs).  Sony�s memory stick has no voltage limitations making it a better choice then Smartmedia but Sony is limited to a 32 Meg max.  Now the reasoning behind why he liked the Compact Flash (CF for short) and I eventually agreed; The CF like the Sony has no voltage limitations and has a current max size of 392 Megs far eclipsing the other 2 types of memory.  

<b> BATTERY ISSUES </b>

   As for the battery usage his complaints about the battery along with his suggestion that I look for a double A based camera also played in my decision.  I can now get 2 to 3x as much camera usage as him based on the cost of his battery.  

<b> BEWARE THE DIGITAL ZOOM </b>

   As I looked over the cameras in my guidelines I realized that many used the phrase �2x Digital Zoom� while some used the phrase �2x Optical Zoom�.  Naturally I was a little puzzled as to what the difference was so I again turned to my brother (as I was sure he�d run in to this himself).  With a digital zoom the camera resizes the picture as it�s taking it (this is cheap to implement) meaning that it could distort your pictures (this was one of my criteria to avoid).  With an Optical Zoom the camera actually has a 35mm to 70mm zoom lens with that takes the picture it�s seeing without resizing the image (in short this makes for better pictures).

<b> CONCLUSION </b>

  There were a few in my price range that had the features that I wanted but the best of them was the DC215.  I ended up getting the camera and a 16 Meg card (it came with a 4 Meg also) for about $420.00.  

<i> &lt;NOTE&gt; The DC215 is essentially the DC210 with a new shell all other specs are identical </i>

   The camera supports an 8.5 x 11 picture and can store 60 of that size picture on 16 Megs (it�ll store 200+ 640 x 480 images on 16 Megs).  It has a built in 2x Optical Zoom and used both the CF and AA batteries.  The picture quality is only 1.1 Mega-pixel which is why it�s limited to 8.5 x 11 but I was fine with that.  It also allows for the storing of 2 templates, which can be used to put a design around the pictures.
 
  I personally love the camera and don�t regret the 12 hours that I spent comparing the cameras and prices.  Now just 2 months after I bought mine, I�ve seen it advertised for only $299.99 and yet, I�m not sorry I didn�t wait.  After buying this camera I found out Kodak allows you to send them the pictures for developing via the Internet.  This Camera is very durable and well designed and should last a long time.  If you�re in the market for one and you want it for family outings to save memories this is the camera for you.  If you want this for professional work you�ll probably want to look at the higher scaled models ranging from 1.5 Mega-pixels 3.3 Mega-pixels.

<b> CONCLUDING EXHORTATIONS </b>

<i> &lt;TIP&gt; Make sure to save a little money for rechargeable batteries </i>
<i> &lt;TIP&gt; If you plan on printing your own pictures I recommend buying a multi-pass printer </i>
<i> &lt;TIP&gt; If you need a professional camera take a look at the DC 280 </i>
