            My G20 has 68k miles and I have owned it for 6 months. My last two cars were both (RWD) Mazda RX7's.

I purchased the car in Dallas and drove it about 1500 miles back to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. During the trip back, through the state of Durango, I took a road called La Espanoza del Diablo (the Devil's Backbone). It is rated as the 10th worst road in the world (9th is somewhere in India) because of the constant bends over a rise and fall in elevation of about 14,000ft over about 100 miles!

The G20 was terrific. The only thing screaming louder than the tires (I was a few pounds light in the left front) was my wife!

Simply put: I have never driven such a superbly handling small sedan. The rear suspension is excellent (something they changed for the worse in the newer models)! They did the same for newer Nissan Maxima's (Nissan is the parent company).

Unfortunately, the only G20 I could find, during my brief stay in Dallas, was a 3-speed automatic with overdrive � if you can find a manual, get it. However, the automatic has 3 different shift options (performance, automatic and comfort) and you really do not miss all that much performance with the automatic � if you also use the shift lever intelligently.

Furthermore, the 3-speed auto with overdrive gives you 75mph at, an almost silent, 2500 revs � and it only starts to redline at 7200 revs and then howls its way up to 9000 revs (when it presumably blows-up!). But, believe me, this is one smooth powerplant for a 2 liter, inline four. The only owners who complain about lack of performancee are, in my opinion, afraid to use the engine's potential (max. torque @ 6,800 revs) and thus, around 7000 revs is when you should up-shift for performance � just don't be afraid of the noise of a high-reving, high-performance engine just because you are only used to the sound of U.S. V8-bangers.

To the best of my knowledge, all Infiniti's are made only in Japan � not the U.S., Mexico or Brazil etc. � and (sorry to say this, but...) it shows! After 6 years, the "only" thing wrong is that the driver's sun visor does not stay up!

I wrote "only" because any honest owner of a 1995 G20 will also tell you that the air-conditioning system is insipid! I do not know if it is the planet-friendly (and very expensive) refrigerant gas or, the compressor that is at fault � but the A/C is pathetic.

Regarding the bells and whistles: it has just about all of them you need � as standard. The only option I would have appreciated is the rear seat fold-down � I think the '95 G20t (also, with a limited slip diff.) has it as standard.

The only thing I would change is the tires � the standard tires are good but transmit far too much road noise and really detract from all the efforts of Infiniti's accoustic engineers. I would also go for fabric seats (instead of the oppulent leather � which are too sweaty, given the A/C).

True, you pay a premium for a G20 (that is essentially a Nissan Sentra) but you get all the extras plus a bigger engine and superb suspension. And apart from that � if you know cars and appreciate the difference between the fastest car and the quickest car � look for a G20(t) and grab it!
