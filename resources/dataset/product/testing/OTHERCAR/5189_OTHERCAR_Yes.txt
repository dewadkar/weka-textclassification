            I leased this car new in May, 1998, and liked it so much three years later that I purchased it. I now have 45,000 miles on it(7/3/2002).

The car is very comfortable, handles smooth and fun to drive. Controls are very conveniently placed and easy to use. The climate control, radio with steering wheel controls, window controls, mirror controls seat and mirror adjustment controls have all operated well and flawlessly in the four years I have had it. The climate control is especially powerful and controls the temp well.  


I would not get this car if you plan to use the back seat a lot. Getting into the back seat from the passenger side is passable, since the front seat slides up, but you have to be a small child or an acrobat to access the back seat from the drivers side. 

 In the 4 years I have had it, the only out of ordinary repairs have been a warped front brake disks ($200)faulty gas gauge (warranty) and a faulty valve in the air pollution control system ($300), all repaired at the dealer. The other problem I am having is the deterioration of the leather seating. The leather seems to be thin and is starting to crack at folds and seams.

The other issue to consider is the lack of body side moldings, which makes the sides of this car vurnable in parking lot situations. I had the dealer install optional body side moldings, which look good.  

The Michelin MX4 plus tires will need replacing soon, and have tended to hydroplane more than I would expect. 

All and all, I am happy with this car and would purchase again.
