            I love my 2000 jimmy it is the best investment I have ever made. I bought it because I travel a lot and never know where and how much stuff I am going to need to bring. I also work at a daycare and it is perfect for when we go on field trips or to the pool or whatever because, I can fit 4 kids and all of their toys and snacks and everything else they need comfortably inside.

I love this vehicle all around. It handles great in all seasons, is comfortable, and I absolutely have nothing I dislike about it.

Anyone should buy this vehicle especially families and people who travel long distance in all terrains. It is an all around great deal :)<br><br>
