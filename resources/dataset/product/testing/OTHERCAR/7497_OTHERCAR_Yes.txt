            After 3 years and 50,000 miles, my family is very pleased with this car.  I bought the Stratus ES (loaded, leather, with V6 engine) with 22,000 miles from a dealer in early 2001 for use as a family car.  We now have two children in carseats, and we take the car everywhere.  

Reliability:
There have been more problems than I would expect from a car this age, but the engine has not had any significant problems.  Shortly after we bought it, there was a slow fluid leak that was repaired for free by the dealer.  The power windows in the rear seem to have a mind of their own&#151it takes a number of tries before they decide to go up or down.  At about 65,000 miles the blower fan for the air/heat shorted out.  This was a $300 replacement, but was covered by our ext. warranty.  The mechanic said it was a fairly common problem in Dodge cars & vans.  The rotors have needed to be machined twice since we&#146ve owned it, so we try to brake lightly.

Performance:
I am very pleased with the V6 engine.  It is very quiet, and does not struggle keeping a constant speed on hills.  Mileage has been disappointing around 25mpg.  Steering is tight with the cab-fwd design, and you can really see the road well.  Winter handling is unimpressive and seems sloppy.  Ride is smooth and is great for long trips.

Features:
The big positive is spaciousness for this class of car.  We have two car seats in the back and can squeeze my wife in the middle if the kids are fussing.  The trunk is very large and the whole back seat folds down allow for more space.  There are lots of holes to store items in, however a BIG complaint is the cup holders&#151they can hold nothing taller than a 12oz can, and their location is partially under the radio/temperature console.  The seats are comfortable though, and the radio is pretty good.  

Negatives:
As stated above, the cup holders are a joke.  But I also greatly dislike the cruise control.  If you grew up on GM vehicles, the Dodge cruise control is a step down.  First and worst is that the motor will actually downshift if you are going down a steep hill and the speed increases 5mph above you cruise setting.  You will think something is wrong as your rpms rocket, and then the car upshifts again within 5 seconds as your speed decreases back to cruise setting.  This is annoying, tough on the engine, and not efficient.  Also annoying is that you can increase your speed at 2mph intervals&#151GM vehicles allow increase or decrease of 1mph at the push of a button.  Another item I worry about is the engine compartment is crammed as tight as possible (the price of cab forward design).  The battery is not visible&#151it is hidden in front of the front wheel, about 6 inches from the ground.  The window washers (located in the hood) clog easily, and can&#146t get fluid on the windshield if there is significant snow/ice on your hood (again, GM vehicles have the washer nozzles on the wipers&#151great idea).  Finally, the car seems to be expensive to insure, you may want to check insurance rates on other similar cars to compare before buying.

Overall it has been a good family car and I would recommend if the price is right and it has been maintained well.
