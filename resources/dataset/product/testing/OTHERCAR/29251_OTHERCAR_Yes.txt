            My 1995 Chevy Blazer is a nice combination of image and utility. It was the first real toy that I bought after graduating from college and, at the time, I was looking for a vehicle that would be an extension of my personality and my statement to the world about my American-made ruggedness and independence (don't worry, I've wised up since then ;-) )

I have also found the Blazer to be very useful. From carting my friends around to country western bars in Dallas to helping people move, the Blazer's fold down back seats, luggage rack, and towing hitch have all come in handy. Other nice features include the four-wheel anti-lock brakes, which have saved me on a couple of occasions, and the quick acceleration. The 190 hp V6 enables me to easily merge onto busy Dallas and Austin freeways while other sport utes clumsily stagger out into traffic. 

Unfortunately, the Blazer has a few knocks. First, it is not very fuel-efficient. Tooling around Dallas would typically cost me about $40 a month, almost twice what I was paying previously with my Chevy Corsica. Secondly, it is not particularly comfortable, especially for long trips. The truck frame and rigid suspension make any drive over three hours tough on my back. Bumpy city streets can also be jarring. I've been in friends' sport utes that are much more comfortable. 

But, in spite of the negatives, the Blazer is fun to drive for short jaunts. I like sitting higher up than a car and the comparatively quick acceleration satisfies the thrill seeker in me. Furthermore, the $18,500 I paid for a used Blazer with 10,000 miles did not put a huge dent in my bank account. 

A note on rollovers: Sport utes have taken some heat in the press for being more prone to rollovers when cornering. I have never had a problem cornering in my Blazer, mainly because I drive like a sane person. Just use your common sense when turning. 

Who should buy the Blazer: 
-	Single people 
-	Families with older kids who have another vehicle for long trips
-	People who move or tow a lot of stuff 

Who should not buy the Blazer:
-	Families with younger children 
-	People who make frequent long trips
