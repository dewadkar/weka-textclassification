            Think of a great car for about $20k-$25k.  There are not many cars that come to mind huh?  Well consider the Honda Accord.  The Accord has the reliability and the high quality craftsmanship of all Honda automobiles.  If you are looking for a car that will last you over ten years, definitely take a look at this new Accord.  The interior is nicely set up, and the seats are extremely comfortable.  There is ample leg and head room for both front and rear passengers.  The car is smooth and the engine is extremely refined.  You will not find a better car that can run as smoothly as the Accord for this price range.  The gears on the automatic transmission shift fluently, and the brakes are very responsive.  Opting for the V-6 is best, because the power and torque comes in handy for uphill excursions or passing on the highway.  The V-6 has incredible power from 60mph to 80mph...which is important to pass large trucks or other dangerous drivers.  This car will not have problems for years and years.  My close friends has driven a 1991 honda accord for the past nine years, and she has had no problems except replacing worn brake pads and other wear items.  However, I do have one problem with the new Honda Accord.  The body style before this current style had a much sportier look, and it was not as clunky.  The handling was much better in the older Accord, mainly due to the size difference.  This current body style is larger and there is much more noticeable body roll.  The new Accord looks more like an American &quot;Boat&quot;  rather than a Japanese import.  The generation before the current was a perfect size, and the styling was much better in terms of lines and aerodynamics.  The New Accord looks like a Dodge Stealth or any other large American 2-door vehicle.  The technical factors of this car are extremely positive, but the styling could use a little work.  So, my recommendation for people seeking a very high quality, reliable machine for 20k-25k, check out the New Accord.  But, you should ask yourself if you really like that oversized coupe look of the Accord.  However, don't let the looks fool you, this car still drives very smoothly and the interior benefits from the larger look by giving much more room for passengers.  I personally appreciate looks more than any other attribute when looking for a car =)<br><br>
