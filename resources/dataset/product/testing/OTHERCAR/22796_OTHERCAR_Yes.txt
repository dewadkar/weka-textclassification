And quite honestly, I couldn't be happier with it.

There's so much room in the backseat, believe it or not. I've had people ride in the back for several hours, and they've all remarked that it's amazingly spacious and comfortable.

Mostly, it's because the rear seats angle UP, which lets you recline into the back seat, elevating your legs, and moving them out of the leg crunch zone. Very nice touch.

The manual shift in this vehicle is smooth, with a responsive clutch and stiff stick action.

I've had this car for 11,000 miles and about six months and to this day, my one complaint is that the cup/can holder is poorly designed; it holds nothing wider than a 12oz. can... oh well.

This is an ideal car for someone who wants a sturdy, practical car for an excellent price. I love mine.<br><br>
