            2002 Dodge Intrepid SE.  Four Doors, V6 automatic.  Sounds like every other car in it's class, right?  WRONG.  The Dodge offers alot of style for the price I paid.  We bought ours after my wife was rear ended in her old car and have more than happy with it ever since.  I'll break the review down into a few categories for you.
PERFORMANCE:  The standard V6 has plenty of power, so long as you don't drive like a maniac.  Pumping out about 200 HP, it was a surprise to me that the car consistently gets around 28 mpg in town and 30+ on the Highway.  The car is very stable in cornering, (almost sporty) and still gives a smooth, quiet ride.

LUXURY / LOOKS:  This is one nice looking car.  Slightly futuristic (we call it the "Missle" due to it's swept back styling), but not freakish.  Our's is a nice silver color and I would recommend it as it hides dirt and scratches pretty well.  You have nice wide tires, sloped lights and a really sharp looking front air dam.  Inside, there's enough room for our two year old's car seat plus two adults of average side to comfortably sit in the back.  Up front, there is ample room for two adults and if you flip the center console up, you can put a small adult or a child with relative comfort.  Again, the car is very smooth riding, so that adds to the comfort level, even with a full load.  The standard stereo equipment is ok, but we replaced the tuner with a higher quality CD player... much better.

DEPENDABILITY / REPAIR COST:  So far, we've only had one problem with the car.  There is a water jacket that sets on top of the motor where the top radiator hose attaches to the engine block.  It started to leak water through it's pressure relief valve.  So I decided to fix it myself.  I've rebuilt motors quite a few times, but only on older cars.  WARNING:  when you pop the hood, don't have a heart attack!  The engine compartment is jam packed FULL of components.  In order to replace the water jacket, I would have had to remove pretty much the top half of the motor (intake) just to get to the bolts holding it on.  Since I don't happen to have the specialized tools required, (even though my wife thinks I have every tool under the sun) nor do I have the computer diagnostic systems needed, I decided to take it to the dealer and get ripped off.  At least I didn't feel guilty about tearing it up worse than it already was.  So a couple of hundred dollars and three days later, she's good as new!  The parts were expensive, as was the labor.  It shouldn't have cost so much for such a simple repair.  It makes you wonder if Dodge designed the car so you, the buyer would be forced to bring it in for repairs.  This isn't a car that your average do-it-yourselfer wants to tear into over the weekend for anything more than changing the oil or other BASIC maintenance.
While I'm thinking about it, if you get the chance to look under the hood, I challenge you to find the battery in less than 1 minute.  Want to know where it is?  In a compartment in front of the right front wheel...  ??  You have to turn the wheel all the way to the right just to get to it.  

I would have to say that overall, asides from the above mentioned problems, this is a great car for your average driver.  My wife only rarely lets me drive it as she is in love with the car.  It is a bit tough for a shorter driver to parallel park and the great size of the car makes it a little more difficult to park for some people.  I would recommend you take a good LONG test drive to make up your mind before buying one.  Also, I would recommend you get the windows tinted QUICKLY as there is alot of glass on this baby!
