            I only drove the Land Rover for a week, but I can provide an initial review of my driving experience.  First, I found the car to be very high, which took some adjustments.  Turns were slower and stops sooner in order to accommodate the car�s weight and cumbersome build.  Although the car was very responsive, I still found its height and massive size to be troublesome.  The one advantage of the Land Rover�s towering frame was that I could easily see every part of the road; however, I felt like a lane hog because the car seemed to take up so much space. I also had difficulty parking the Land Rover since I could not squeeze into all those useless compact spaces.  

Second, I enjoyed the smooth, quiet ride.  Despite its mammoth size, the Land Rover is very easy to drive.   I was unaffected by the noisy streets; in fact driving in the Land Rover is somewhat like driving in a bubble.  I was more like an omniscient presence rather than a victim of the crowded highway.  Roomy and comfortable, the Land Rover�s interior is pleasing and relaxing.  Every button or lever was accessible and logically placed.  I had no problem quickly finding the defrost button or adjusting the mirrors.

But in the end, several small issues of the Land Rover bothered me.  Although the car is very high, the windshield was not. I had great difficulty seeing the traffic lights in front of me because when I looked up, I only saw the roof.  Driving at night was also challenging because the car�s control panel did not light up enough.  I couldn�t even read the clock without turning on an interior light.  And the car guzzled gas faster than a frat boys drinks cheap beer.  So make sure to test-drive this expensive car to see if you enjoy the driving experience, rather than just its name.
