            The Volvo S80 is a solid luxury car that feels like a sports car but is a sound, safe family car.  I love its handling, turning radius, and overall driving feel.

I considered other cars in my recent purchase decision, but they paled before the safety record and driving enjoyment I experience with the Volvo S80.  I frankly decided to lease the car because I wanted it and loved its features, but couldn't afford to buy it outright.

I can't think of a thing that I hate about it, or even dislike.  It is the perfect car for a family - big enough to hold three kids in the back seat without much friction!

Great car!<br><br>
