            I've been a fan of Olympus digital cameras, being an owner of their D-500L SLR camera for more than 4 years. I had already recommended the D-490 to my brother, and decided that I could also use a 2 megapixel camera for myself. One day, I saw an ad flash on Yahoo for the C-211 for less than $300, so I decided to take the bait and purchase one.

<b>Basic Features</b>
The C-211 is essentially a 3x zoom 2.1 megapixel digital camera, with all the basic features like LCD viewer, auto, closeup, 2.5', infinite focus modes, and auto, redeye reduction, slow, disabled flash modes. I'm sort of a purist so I almost never use digital zoom, but it's nice to know that the C-211 also has 2x digital zoom. The camera uses the popular SmartMedia for storage, and uses 4 AA size batteries.

<b>Ease of Use</b>
The C-211 is relatively easy to use, with a dial that chooses between photo, view, print, and setup modes under the right thumb if the camera was held by the right hand. The shutter button is right under the lens, which would be controlled by the right index finger. The zoom dial is below the right side of the LCD viewer which would also be controlled by your right thumb. The left hand would be used to control the four buttons right below the LCD, which chooses flash and focus modes as well as invoking menus and deleting unwanted images.

<b>Instant Photo Prints</b>
The C-211 uses Polaroid 500 films for printing, and I was rather underwhelmed by the print quality. Although the color reproduction was pretty good, the prints lacked detail and looked a little blurry. To print, the dial has to be set to print mode, which is similar to view mode, except you have the ability to push the light green button under the zoom dial to print the photo you selected. It takes only a few seconds to print, and the film pops up at the top of the camera.

<b>Traveling to Japan</b>
Besides carrying my usual Canon 35mm camera, I decided to take along the C-211 instead of the D-500L for my recent trip to Japan. I also bought a 64MB SmartMedia to supplement the 8MB one that came with the camera. I took more than 200 photos of Tokyo Auto Salon (a car show), sights in Kyushu, and the awesome snow and ice sculptures at the Sapporo Snow Festival. I was so impressed with how the C-211 handled different lighting conditions, the 35mm camera didn't see much action except for outdoor photos. The C-211 was especially adept at capturing sharp and detailed night images, with or without flash as long as I had a steady hand, and no tripod required!  
  
<b>Overall Impression</b>
I'd assume other Olympus digital cameras would have similar quality and features to the C-211, so I highly recommend an Olympus, especially at similar prices ($200-$250 w/o shipping). As for the instant photo print feature, it's just a novelty, unless for some reason you don't have access to PC or quality photo printers. It also makes the C-211 rather bulky, which means you'll need a large camera bag, backpack, or have it strapped under your neck. 

However, the photo print feature did help me a lot during the trip, as I made instant friends by printing images on the spot for them.
