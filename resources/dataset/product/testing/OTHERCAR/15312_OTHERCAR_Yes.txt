            There's a lot of talk about the pros and cons of storing pictures on a floppy disk (as this camera does) versus a 'smart card' or 'memory chip' used by other brands.  Floppy disks don't hold as many pictures (they're approx 1.5 mg) while 'smart cards' and 'memory chips' come in various sizes (4 mg, 8 mg, 16 mg, etc.).  But floppies are cheap (50/$10) while the others are not (I was told approx. $40/8 mg but don't quote me on this).  

But what sold me on the Mavicas was their overwhelming advantage if you are traveling.  Other brands require either a physical hook-up (via a cable) to the computer or a disk adaptor (approx. $60).  It's my understanding that you also have to load some software into your computer.  This might be fine if you are home - but what if you're on the road.  We're going to Europe for two weeks - will be taking lots of pictures.  I won't have access to *my* computer to download pictures so I'd have to take multiple memory chips/smart cards.  I wouldn't be able to download the pictures until I get home.  I can buy floppies anywhere in Europe.  Any computer can decipher the floppies since the pictures are already stored in .jpg format.  If I can find an internet cafe, I can just stick the diskette in and e-mail pictures to my home e-mail address (or friends at work or whatever) and re-use the diskettes.  Or even if I just keep the diskettes - 50 diskettes for $10 dollars is 75 mg of storage - much cheaper than smart cards.  And if a floppy goes bad, so what??  Just grab another one and stick it in.  

Even at home, I find the floppies much more user-friendly.  I took pictures of a party at work - they were downloaded and printed within 5 minutes.  And I made copies of the diskettes right in the camera - didn't need a computer.  

At the lowest resolution (which makes photo quality 5 by 7 prints), you can store approx 25 pictures per floppy.  It takes just seconds to switch them out.  I almost never use the higher resolutions.

All in all, I'm extremely pleased with this camera.  The only thing better would be the newest camera Sony is introducing - it stores the photos on a CD!!!  Wow - this will hold thousands of pictures.  Unfortunately, it will cost over twice as much.  <br><br>
