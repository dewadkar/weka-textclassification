            I bought the Agfa CL 30 as my first digital camera.  I've used Sony Magiva's at work, but elected to buy the Agfa because of their reputation in the photo industry (I consistently use Agfa film).  Also, as a Steve Jobs era USB equipped Macintosh user, the Sony's floppy disk media would necessitate the purchase of a USB floppy drive for my iMac and my Powerbook G3.  The Agfa shines in it's variety of connectivity options.   Both USB and RS232 serial cables are included.  And the versatility of the flash media cards used to store it's pictures are also a plus for Laptop or Powerbook users. I quickly upgraded though from the provided 4mb card to 48mb which holds over 200 photos.  With the purchase of an optional PCMIA card bus adapter ($12.95), I can simply slide the flash card into my Powerbook.  The card mounts directly on the Mac OS desktop (or as additional drive with Windows...they are PC format) and pictures can be easily dragged to my hard disk icon.  This has by far been the most reliable and quickest way to transfer pictures from the camera to my computer.  The USB connectivity, while it was one of the motivating factors in my purchase, was often inefficient due to the need to reboot my Mac in order for the camera to be found on the USB bus.   Furthermore, the transfer was often interrupted or not possible due to low battery power.  I have found that the &quot;Energizer Photo &quot; AA Batteries ($8.00 for 4) last the longest but even with these the CL30 is a power hungry beast.   These batteries lasted almost 1 month but all other brands that I've tried lasted less than a week and in some cases only days.  The CL30's LCD screen is part of the problem.  I often find myself leaving it off to conserve energy as it quickly drains the available battery power.  The camera does have a &quot;viewfinder&quot; like conventional cameras that one can look through to aim and focus in on a subject, while saving battery power with the LCD off.  The LCD's screens deficiencies do not stop there unfortunately.  The Agfa's screen is almost impossible to view outdoors when there is any degree of sunlight even when the LCD is set for outdoor use in the CL30's programmable menu.    I find the LCD only useful when indoors or when viewing it in a well shaded area and even then less impressive than say Sony Magiva's view screen.  The image on the Agfa's LCD shakes erratically when you move and the color fades in and out sharply as if it has a difficult time adjusting to the change in light conditions.  Noteworthy is the programmable menu itself which features multiple flash and focus options including a macro setting and an anti-red eye pre-flash.  The camera also takes a good 20 seconds to warm up which makes for poor success in those spontaneous &quot;quick get the camera&quot; moments.  In closing, the Agfa CL30 was hardly worth the 2 week wait that it took me to get it from ritzcamera.com.   The Agfa with it's shortcomings would be a decent basic introduction to the world of digital photography if  there weren't so many superior competitors in the same price class.  It set me back a whopping $350 ($300 after a $50 rebate which I have not yet received after 7 weeks) and would have to be about half it's price to truly be an attractive option. <br><br>
