            Synopsis:  

We have had this �96 Outback since new.  I would heartily recommend this over a car-based SUV and to those looking for a mid-sized station wagon.  We have a '94 Grand Cherokee, which my mother couldn�t quite handle.  It was a bit too top-heavy for her and too tall for her 5� body to get into easily.  We live in the Northeast (I�ve since moved to Chicago), so good snow/rain/sleet performance was mandatory.  

Specs:  

2.5L horizontal 4-cyl. engine, full-time AWD, power-and-cold weather package.  

Design/Practicality:  

It�s a good-looking, if a bit overly-decaled car.  It is very space efficient, especially in passenger room, but the cargo area is shallow.  The interior is well laid-out with a huge windshield that gives a great view, but the too-small cup-holders come out of the center dash blocking the climate control.  The standard 4-speaker Panasonic is very mediocre and sounds lifeless � disappointing, considering how much they got right with the rest of the car.  We�ve lived with it, but I would recommend changing both the head unit and the speakers.  I priced better replacements (Alpine CD + 4 speakers) in the $3-500 range.  The heated, grippy seats are wonderful and firm, just one notch below the throne-like Saab and Volvo seats (truly orthopedic paradise�), but the headrests don�t go back far enough and cause you to kind of slouch forward.  The seating position works wonders for my parents (nearly perfect they say), but is a bit more awkward for my girlfriend and me�perhaps because we�re taller.  I think you could probably get used to it.  

Driveability:  

Truly great.  Extremely comfortable both in the city and on the highway.  The entire drivetrain is silky smooth and provides near 6-cylinder power while giving you 26-28MPG combined.  The ride is well dampened and smooth, and on par with the best in class.  The standard Michelins are a bit noisy, but I suspect a set of more road-oriented tires would solve that.  The AWD is unintrusive and provides great grip.  Never been stuck once even in sizable snowdrifts.

Quality/Maintenance:  

Near perfect and nothing has gone wrong.  The interior trim and fabrics have worn wonderfully with little wear even after all the bike hauling and muddy gear that�s thrown in there.  The gray lower-body paint tends to scratch and chip easier than you would think, so be warned if you�re planning on driving on a lot on trails or unpaved roads.  Maintenance is as straightforward as with any normal wagon; it sips gas and doesn�t really consume any oil.  No leaks or the like to report after 70K miles.  

Buying a used one?  

Make sure the maintenance was done and look for detailed service records.  As with any 4WD, the 15K/30K/60K service intervals are pretty important and you want to make sure that they�ve been done.  The Outback is one of the most versatile cars I've ever driven.  Subaru�s have a great reputation for durability and quality, so I would have no problem recommending one that checks out ok.<br><br>
