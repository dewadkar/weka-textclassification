            My husband and I fell in love with car when we
saw it on a trip to Oklahoma. There is was sitting
on to lot looking so sporty and shiny. We decided 
to go test drive. Well, that was it. We had to 
have one. It rides so smooth, like a dream. It has 
an exceptionally large windshield which makes it
easy to see all around you. I really like that.
The front seat leg area is quite roomy, even with 
the seat pulled all the way forward. The back seat 
is also roomy enough for two adults to sit very
comfortably. The back seat will lay forward to make
it easy to haul things if you need. This car get good 
gas mileage 23 mpg. This car is great for someone
who needs lots of room, 4 doors, and good mileage.
I love mine!!<br><br>
