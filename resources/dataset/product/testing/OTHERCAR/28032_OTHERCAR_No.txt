            Okay, I bought a 2000 Plymouth Neon Highline LX on the 5th of March. By the 11th of March (less than a week) it was already in the shop. How I wish I had come to Epinions before I made this grave mistake. The first thing that went wrong were the windows. Now, I am finding out that the windows are the first sign of trouble with the Neon. Well, I paid a hefty price for my Neon, so it makes the whole thing harder to swallow for me. I got automatic windows, automatic locks, automatic mirrors, CD player, Air Conditioning, Computer Chip Keyless entry, Padlock, Alarm, the whole nine yards. And its a worthless piece of cr*p ! 

Every time I tried to roll down my driver-side window, my gauges would go crazy ! Bad relay wire somewhere. I took it to the shop, and it stayed there all day, and they still could not find the problem. I took it back and now its been there (in the shop) for 3 days and they still cannot find the bad relay wire. I am now driving a rental car. This is such a nightmare. I am afraid this might be only the beginning. I have lost total confidence in the car. I know this may sound minor to some people, but its not minor when your brand new car that you bought with 6 miles on it, is taken to the shop within the first week, and has been in the shop twice within a month of buying it, for the same problem, that cannot seem to be fixed. ALWAYS BUY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY. That was the smartest thing I have ever done. The 72,000 mile extended warranty has saved my butt ! I cannot wait to get rid of this thing. 

Sorry I vented. but, I hope this saves somebody from making the same mistake I did. DO NOT BUY THE NEON. And definitely come to Epinions.com before you buy ANY car ! I have learned my lesson.

Smart Shopping,
