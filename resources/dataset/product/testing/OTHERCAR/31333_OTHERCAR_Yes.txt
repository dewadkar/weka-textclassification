            I actually own a 1994 LHS and love its elegant styling and roomy interior.  It has been a high-maintenance car but nevertheless has performed extremely well over the years. Although the LHS is targeted at a much older market, I am a 20-something and feel like it suits my lifestyle perfectly.  I bought my LHS because of its unique design and I felt it out-classed almost all other cars in its category save the Lincoln Towncar (which is much pricier).  
The new redesigned LHS is sportier but still retains its elegance and unique styling.  An aggressive retro-style grill with the impressive Chrysler logo definitely gives it character.  The interior of the new LHS is more luxurious than past models and the roominess is still present. Overall, a very intelligent new design that turns a lot of heads out on the road.
It is obviously designed for the older executive and his/her family, but believe me the single professional or young professional couple would love the performance of this car.  A young whippersnapper driving into the parking lot of his/her company might just get a reserved parking space and maybe even an invitation to be the fourth in next week's golf-outing with the CEO.<br><br>
