            I bought my 94 dodge intrepid used from a 40 something housewife about 2.5 years ago out of an auto trader.  The woman and her husband maintained the car very well i must say, regular oil changes etc.  I had the car thoroughly checked out by a reputable mechanic and he said that to have 85k miles on it, it was in great shape.

So now my car has 102k miles on it and I'm still very glad I made that purchase.  I have had two trips to the shop since I bought it. One trip was to change a small part- some sort of bushing, $75. The next time I went in was for a leak in the water pump just recently.  The crappy place that I went to have an oil change at told me the water pump would be $380 including labor.  Luckily my step dad knows about cars and he replaced the pump plus all the hoses for $60. So don't fall for any of the tricks if its a simple water pump replacement.

Now my car is fixed and its purring like a kitten now. The intrepid is one of the most comfortable cars you will ever drive. The seating is wonderful and the trunk space is big enough to fit a small horse in :)
I would recommend this car. It has caused me minimal problems but then again I keep the oil changed and the maintenance up.
