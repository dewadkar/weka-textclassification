PERSONAL EXPERIENCE 

A few years back I purchased the predecessor of this model. The Epson PhotoPC 500, I wanted to experience the pleasure of digital photography. For a while I would carry both my regular camera and the digital one, just in case. I had a hard time to understand how a camera could take pictures without a film. Eventually as I got use to this camera and I learned all the advantages of digital photography, I started to leave the conventional camera at home. 

I was so please with the model 500, that I decided to purchase the 650. Both cameras have more or less the same features, but the major difference with the 650 is that it comes with USB attachments, therefore there is no needs for adaptors as was required for the model 500. 

I am preparing for a three weeks trip to Asia and the first thing I did was to make certain I had a supply of fresh batteries. This may be the only negative point I encountered. If you let your batteries go weak the camera will not work. You may not loose the pictures you already took, since there is a secondary mini-battery to preserve them but in order for the camera to function the batteries have to be fresh and it will only take the recommended types. So if you go away and you are not sure if the type of battery is available where you are going, do bring some extras with you. 

I do recommend the Epson PhotoPC 650 to anyone who wants to try the pleasure of digital photography.
