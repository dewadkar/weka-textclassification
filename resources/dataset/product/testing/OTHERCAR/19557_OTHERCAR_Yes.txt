            There are already many reviews on the Suburban. So rather than focus too much on features and design, I'm going to take a slightly different tack. Less comment on product and more on experience with quality and service. This is a summary of my experience after owning one for almost 5 years. 

I originally bought this 5.7L 2WD LT model as a gift to my wife. I had actually waited for the day General Motor's strike ended and the dealer price gouging stopped! In fact, the first dealer I visited that day apparently had not heard the strike was over and still wanted $3000 premium due to the "short supply." He called me later that night and I gently broke the news to him that I found a dealer who was more "accommodating." !!! Touche.

This Suburban is top of the line LT with probably everything you could get short of On-Star service and 4WD. I put a tow bar on in hopes of getting a new boat but that never came true so its never been used to tow. Oh well, dream on. We've put 47000 miles on this mostly for in town driving and kid hauling.  I've used it to haul lots of lumber and landscaping stuff but this is what everybody knows the Suburban excels at. 

It has been driven on several long trips from Texas to Florida. Having taken these same trips in our old Mazda MPV, the Suburban is like heaven.  We carry all our junk to the beach and have room to spare even when friends come along. The ride is great. It is the perfect land yacht. And I found that, although everyone complains about the gas mileage, it is reasonable on the highway if you keep a steady foot and use the cruise control. I was getting 21-22 MPG average over 700 miles of driving. Yeah, the mileage is OBVIOUSLY not great compare to a Honda Accord but considering the vintage of technology, size and weight, the utility - it should be expected. Go to Europe and pay for gas there THEN tell me it costs too much. Considering what this thing can do, its worth the gas cost. Nuff said.

Also, having owned several Japanese vehicles, I had high expectations for durability and quality. So, this being the second American built automobile I've ever owned (once owned a 75' Ford Pinto - disposable), I have been both pleased and frustrated. No car is perfect, and even amo
ng Japanese brands I find some are mediocre quality, some excellent. And all cars have problems.  But the Chevy quality seems a little, shall I say manic depressive? I mean, some problems should just not happen...let me explain:

At 30000 miles, and after the warranty expired, the water pump started dripping bearing oil and so I replaced it. It was not that difficult to replace (did it myself). Parts for American cars are definately more reasonable and available than Japanese car parts even to this day. So should a water pump fail after only 30000 miles? This is  a primary component and GM ought to jump on their parts suppliers for such poor component quality. I hope CEO of GM takes note. 

Other little things are a bother. The windshield wipers started acting up recently. At first I thought the entire controller was failing but it seems that cleaning the contacts on the controller's plug fixes the problem. Another thing I hope GM improves. 

Having to grease the front-end ball joints every 3000 miles and grease front wheel bearings is also "work" that unfortunately comes with this generation of GM truck technology. Hopefully the new design eliminates this need with sealed bearings and ball joints. 

The original tires were replaced - they only lasted 20,000 miles. I replaced them with Michelin LT light truck tires (not the passenger "P" version - avoid those as they are not that strong in the side wall). These are excellent tires and give the big Suburban and much better ride. Not really expensive amortized over their life. Over 20000 miles on them and they have barely worn. (They are French made though....:-)

The leather seats are nice but the leather is actually a low grade and has started crack even though it as been properly cleaned and conditioned. The leather has absorbed dye from clothing so now its miscolored in spots. I hear newer models use better,  more supple leather.

The battery ruptured suddenly one night during a freeze but was covered under warranty. They repaired the acid damage. The replacement failed six months later the morning of departure for Florida! It was still in warranty but after two Delco battery failures you start to wonder. So I ran down to Sears and got a Trailmaster Die Hard.  A very good battery that I know will last.

A comment about dealer service - the dealer was pretty responsive on the first battery failure but you've got to stay on top of them. They took care of the battery problem quickly but you know the rest. Also, the alignment was bad from the start and the dealer's friendly disposition did not hide the fact that after two tries we had to take it to a specialty alignment shop (who got it perfect in less than 30 minutes and its driven straight since). 

I must say though, the overall design is hard to beat. My wife is petite yet finds this monster easy to drive. She likes the great vantage of sitting up high. The drivability of this vehicle is excellent for such a large machine. The proven push rod design 5.7 L engine essentially runs very well. It is smooth and responsive. And I expect the core of it (cranks, bearings, rings) to last a long time. I qualify this by admitting I'm anticipating other peripheral parts i.e. alternator, A/C and P/S pumps to need replacing sooner than for my Japenese cars. I've come to accept this as par for the course with American technology. 

I find the "older" design easy to work on. In fact, when it comes to long trips, I would much rather take my chances traveling in a Suburban knowing that there is a Chevy dealer in many towns across our country and even across the Americas' at large. Parts can be found everywhere too. I don't know much about the new designs but I believe this will keep many units of this generation of Suburban on the road. As older ones pass along they will be kept running because of the simple fact that the technology is within the grasp of DIY mechanics. This should keep resale value high. 

Final Commentary

There have been some annoying things go wrong with this car but I still love this Suburban. Kind of like siblings :-) My father drove Chevy brand company cars and always experienced quality issues. I believe alot was due to poor assembly and inconsistent parts supplier quality. Silly stuff that could be avoided if GM would take a little pride out on the line...and reign in their suppliers.  I recently read an article quoting a GM VP as saying they should notch up the quality and overcome these General Sloppy assembly and supplier problems. The original engineering is solid but the build quality STILL TO THIS DAY trails the Japanese and Germans. The Japanese competitors are starting to enter Suburban territory with bigger truck and SUV designs. The Germans have taken over  Chysler and have already made noise about how they plan to bring "German quality" to the Dodge truck and SUV designs. GM still has an edge with the Suburban's unique blend of power and true utility that other's may try to surpass in a few years. 

I see THIS family as having a Suburban in the driveway for years to come. Given the excellent design, one should hope for quality to match. My only hope is GM leaders find it in themselves to bring about a level of quality that would become as legendary as the Suburban name.
