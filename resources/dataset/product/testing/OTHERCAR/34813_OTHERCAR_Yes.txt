            Wow! That's all I had to say the first time I took this off road. It climbed, and descended hills as guys in a jacked-up jeep sat with their jaws opened.  I can't say enough about how great this is off road. The climbing power and the hill descent control are amazing. The only time I had trouble was on some sand and I didn't want to let air out of my tires or we could have made it up that hill as well. For digging this thing is a monster.

Unfortunately we live in LA and our time spent off road is somewhat limited. We went with the Discovery because we needed the extra seats and we are not ready to be mini-van people yet. We have found the back seats very convenient, although not the roomiest for full sized adults. The car handles fairly well, it feels a little top heavy but with the ACE it doesn't seem to sway as much as the old ones did.  Of course it is a little top heavy, that comes from being 6�4�, which brings up the other issue to consider before you purchase one. Look at parking garages in your area. A few times I have had to get out and watch the top as we have scraped into garages.

The down side to this car centers mainly on its engine. Although they added a little more hp to the series 2 it still is slow getting on the freeway. It also seems to be working so hard that it is too noisy and burns too much gas. We were only getting 8 mpg when we first got it, it's up to 10mpg 6 months later. We are hoping it continues to improve but that is way more premium gas then we put in the budget.  

The car is very nice, it�s not as luxurious as the Range Rover but then it�s half the cost. We really like the car, and love it off road but if Jeep had a Grand Cherokee with a far back seat I think we would rather have that.  The Grand Cherokee we had previously was better for getting around town, you could park where you wanted and it didn�t draw as much attention.
