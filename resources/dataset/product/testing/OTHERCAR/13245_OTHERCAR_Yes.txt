            To preface my review, the car I had before my 1999 Honda Accord was a piece of junk (see my Mazda Millenia review) and there was no love lost when I left the Mazda (aka Bucket of Bolts) at the Honda dealer and drove away in my sporty dark green 1999 Honda Accord V6.

For starters, I know that I can rely on my Honda.  It is virtually maintenance free, except for the routine oil changes, tire maintenance, etc.  The Certified Used Honda program is great - it provides peace of mind and a one year bumper to bumper warranty, but I haven't had to use it yet, because absolutely nothing has gone wrong in the six months that I have owned the car.

Let's talk about features:  the interior is very spacious, all instruments are placed properly, the cup holders do not get in the way of the radio, the A/C can be fully automatic or manually adjusted, the sunroof/moonroof work flawlessly, and the leather interior of the car looks brand new, even though the car is almost 4 years old.  The trunk is absolutely huge and has both a "ski door" from the trunk through the armrest area, as well as the entire back seat folding down, to accommodate oversized items.

I love the eight-way power adjustable seat on the driver's side for customizing the driver's comfort.  The seats are not overly cushioned, but they are very comfortable, even for 7-8 hour drives.  The passenger side does not have power adjustments, but that hasn't seemed to bother any of my passengers.  The back seat is more rigid, but there seems to be enough leg room for adults, provided they are not extremely tall.

The car drives like a Honda - smooth ride, peppy acceleration, stiff suspension, and sensitive brakes.  I happen to like this combination, but if you have never driven a Honda before and are considering one, test drive to make sure you like it.  The V6 is nice for power while maintaining excellent gas mileage.  I average about 25 MPG in the city and about 29 MPG on long interstate trips!  The engine is very quiet, both at idle and on acceleration.  Acceleration is fairly smooth, however, some drivers might sense a slight jerkiness as the transmission changes gears, during acceleration as well as deceleration - this has been the case for all the Hondas I have owned, so I assume that it is just a characteristic of the Honda transmission.  The ride is extremely smooth with very little outside noise, even at interstate speeds.  

The exterior styling is generic but pleasant.  The car has clean lines, an excellent paint finish, and is not made of plastic like so many cars are today.  When the car is clean, she is beautiful.

My absolute favorite feature in this car is somewhat silly, but I ADORE the audio controls on the steering wheel!  It allows you to control the volume of the sound system, change radio stations, or change tracks on a CD, all with the touch of a button on the left side of the steering wheel.  I drive with my thumb on this at all times.  Not only is this super-convenient, but it is safe because you don't have to take your eyes off of the road to change the audio system.

So far, I have no complaints about this car whatsoever.  After the nightmare experience I had with the Mazda, I smile everyday as I drive around in my reliable, sensible, but comfortable and convenient 1999 Honda Accord V6.
