            As a loyal Toyota car-owner, the Landcruiser is my most prized possession. The Landcruiser is, in my opinion, the best you can find in off-road driving. It is particular impressive in its ability to traverse uneven, rocky terrain, while ice or snow driving is not quite as remarkable.  Front seating is comfortable and spacious; in the older models there was a paucity of cup-holders.  This has since been corrected (or even overcorrected).  Apparently, this complaint was taken to heart by the designers of the Landcruiser, and the design went from 2 to 11 cup holders between 1997 and 1998.  In addition, models from 1998 have been equipped with a V-8 engine which provides additional power on hills.  Safety is also a strong feature of the vehicle, at least for those riding inside it.  The leg room in the second row seats is a little narrow, and with the optional third row seat in, there is little room for luggage or shopping. 

Having driven my Landcruiser over 100,000 miles in the past three years, the vehicle still feels like new.  There ride is a little less smooth and more &quot;rattly&quot; than when I first acquired the vehicle, but what can one expect for a vehicle that has been used so extensively.  I have also test driven the latest V-8 models and have found that the ride is smoother and more responsive.

Handling of the vehicle, is of course, not as impressive as a sports-coupe, but this is not a vehicle meant to be driven like a sports car.  One does feel that, unlike smaller SUV's, there is very little tipping sensation when traveling around curves, probably because of the high weight of the vehicle.  

The price of the Landcruiser is of course, quite high, but if you are looking for a top of the line SUV, it is either this or the Range Rover.<br><br>
