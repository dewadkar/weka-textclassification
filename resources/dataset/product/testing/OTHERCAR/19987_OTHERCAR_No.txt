            The 1988 Plymouth Colt DL was imported by Plymouth from Mitsubishi. It is actually a Mitsubishi Mirage, and in 1988, it shared many of the same parts as the Hyundai Excel.

I bought this car from my girlfriend's friend for $600.00. It had 98,000 original miles and seemed to run good. I knew it had some minor problems which I was prepared to fix, but two days after I bought it, the rear main seal blew. The mechanic I ended up bringing it to was like most mechanics... a thief. Of coarse he found as many things wrong with it as he could break, and he broke a bunch.

SO... WHY DID I BUY THIS P.O.S.?  

HERE ARE ITS BAD POINTS;  Let's see... it uses about 1 qt. of oil a week, but I have no idea where it's leaking/burning from as there is no smoke or driveway stains. At lower speeds, acceleration is poor. It's not very good on gas (25MPG Highway). Under the hood, it is hard to get to some of the normal maintenance parts, especially the oil filter. It has a 2 barrel carb. and parts are not readily available for it. The auto transmission shifts at incorrect shift points, which drives me crazy. Something in the driver's side front brake rattles (who would design a brake system where that could ever happen???). The catalytic converter broke a week after I bought it, and I also had to spend $800. on the rear main seal and an oil pump. The handling characteristics do not give the driver a feel for what's going on with the engine or road surface... it inspires no confidence in the driver for the way it runs or handles. It's not good in the snow. One headlight lost its shiny reflective material due to a water leak. The seats are not very comfortable for long trips. The exterior's  paint is ugly. Both front door locks lock in a funny manner, and sometimes they don't work at all without putting up a fuss (no rhyme or reason to when they don't work). When changing the station on the radio, my sleeve has caught the shift lever a few times and put the car in neutral while I was driving... YIKES!  The paper in the rear factory speakers deteriorated and blew apart at normal volumes. Parts for this car are just not available anymore.

HERE ARE SOME GOOD POINTS: The horn works good! The car is not worth ripping off, so I don't have to lock it ever. The brakes and hand brake work well. It has electronically adjustable dual rearview mirrors. It has a luggage rack. The intermittent wipers work well, (but like most, they don't slow down enough). It cruises well and is tight at 70MPH. It has a rear window defroster that almost works by the time I get to work. It has a decent heater, but the fan must run all the time in order to heat your body all over consistently. The 5 MPH bumpers actually work and show no damage when hit at its rated speed.  The spark plugs, distributor, and coil are right in front and can be easily worked on... and you will work on them!  The shift lever is in the center consul instead of the column... I like that. The dash, although square-ish like all 80's cars, is laid out fairly well. The gas gauge reads the amount of gas you actually have in the tank, as opposed to staying on full until you have 1/4 tank left, then dropping fast. The seat recline and will accommodate leg room for taller people, and the head rests are height adjustable. For an 88, it has very little rust and is factory undercoated.

This car was a decent deal for $600. If it was a Corolla, Sentra, Civic, or an equivalent, it would have been $1500. and parts would be more available. If you're a do-it-yourselfer, you know Mitsus', and you don't have much money, then this car might be right for you... (but I doubt it!)

Hope this helps,
Dean
