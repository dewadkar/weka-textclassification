            i would recommend buying the turbo version if anyone ever runs across one because it is a well made piece of mitsubishi history, but i would not recommend the non turbo version if you want a car with speed but as a normal car it is wonderful. Mine has a mitsubishi eclipse tsi engine that pumps out close to 200 horsepower stock. It is the ultimate sleeper of a car. The only problem ive had was that in the winters it has a hard time with traction and just stability. Ive tried locating another colt turbo for sell but have been not able to find one. My plans are to build a street racer out of a dodge colt turbo but i need to find another one with a better body then mine because the winters have been unkind to mine which is a little rusty.
