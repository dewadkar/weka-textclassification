            For two years I waited.  I wanted to get my finances into a position where I would be able to afford an Audi A4.  The styling and non-descript luxury were what initially attracted me to the Audi.  Once I drove it, I was in love with the handling.  This car feels like nothing I have ever driven and I have had Beamers and a Benz.  It seems as if the center of gravity is right underneath the driver at all times and the tipronic shifting only enhances that feeling.  I was working on a golf course contract in Alberta and I am originally from BC.  It was a lucrative venture so I was able to afford the Audi.  Then the day came.  I found an A4 Quattro 2.8 at South Center Fine Cars in Calgary, Alberta.  It was blue with black leather.  The only thing it didn't have that I wanted was the Bose stereo but no matter.
I drove the car off the lot after a $5000 down payment.  Upon delivery the floor mats were in bags on the floor and when I asked the delivery guy if he could put the down for me he rolled his eyes, did it and walked away.  I had no idea how any of the features of the car worked because nobody explained anything to me.  The car I bought had a CD shuttle in it and when I went to pick it up it was gone.  When I went in to ask what happened to it I saw one sitting on a small table in the manager's office.  They had clearly removed it hoping that I didn't remember that it was part of the deal.  I had them put it in the next day.  Despite all of this I loved it and wanted it and enjoyed it for the first week like no other purchase I had ever made.  The sales person actually phone me at work and told me to say that I was happy with the reviews and service that I received or he wouldn't get paid.  So when I was asked I said it was fine, as the Audi people phone the next day. 
  Then it happened.  I went out to start it one morning and as it turned over I heard an awful clanging noise in the engine.  I looked at the dash and it said, service oil.  I thought this impossible as this was a new car.  So restarted it.  The clanging was still there and progressed into a banging noise and the whole car was shaking violently.  There was a tremendous squeal that sounded like metal on metal and the car stopped.
I jumped out and went to a garage across the street from the hotel I was staying in and brought the mechanic over to look at it.  I told him what happened and when we checked the oil it was dry.  
South Center Fine Cars had neglected to put oil in it when they pdi'd it.
I called Audi Canada and reported the incident and they sent a tow truck out to pick it up.  
I went into Calgary which was about 90 minutes away from where I was and the dealership said that it was impossible that it was out of oil.  The technician checked it and sure enough it was.  They rented me a cheap car for a week and told me that they would check it out for me.  I told them I wanted a new car.  The owner of the dealership said I would have to pay more money to him to get me into the new car as this was 1999 and the car I had was 1998 although it was new.  
The technician told me that I should have tried to start it again and floor it to make sure that I blew the engine.  Of course I didn't do that but now I wish I would have.
The car was &quot;checked out&quot; and everything was ok.  I phoned another Audi dealership and spoke with a tech there and he told me that there was no way that after that kind of experience that the car didn't sustain damage.  I reported this to South Center and the owner of the dealership told me that he has to back his technician and the car was fine.  So basically they put oil in it and told me to have a nice day.  From that day on the car continued to give me starting problems and blue smoke sometimes comes out of the back.
I moved back to Vancouver after my contract ended and told the dealer there about my problems with the car and he was very helpful.  Although I can understand that this isn't his problem I was sure he could put me in touch with the correct people to solve this problem.  I still had faith in Audi and all I wanted was a new vehicle.  Or for Audi Canada to cost one out to the dealership so I could move into it.  My intent had always been to keep the car as I like four doors and I am a skier so all wheel drive is perfect.  I even purchased a $1000.00 Thule ski box for the top.
Anyway, the dealership manager put me in touch with the area representative for Audi of Western Canada and I told him my story.  He seemed quite sympathetic as to my problem and assured me I would be happy with the resolution he came up with and he would call me a let me know.  One month went by and I called him back and he stated that he had spoken with the owner of South Center Fine Cars in Calgary and that I had no problem with my car as he checked it out.  I asked him if he thought it would be reasonable for this dealer to admit that he actually forgot to put oil in one of his new cars.  He had no answer for me. Audi marketing has phoned me twice to check if I was happy with the service and delivery and with the vehicle and on both occasions I have told them the story.  They would always register shock on the phone and assure me that someone would call to take care of this and no one ever has.  One year later I continue to have starting grief with my car, I have put a huge down payment and pay $630.00 each month into a car that I don't want to keep and Audi still hasn't phoned me back.  I am waiting for the buy-out price of the car to come in line with book value of it so that I can get out of it.  
The dealer here says that I should sell it privately because he doesn't want it, and I can't conscienably sell it to someone when I know it's history.  
Audi may have got my money this time but they never will again.  
Audi, you spend millions of dollars each year on advertising and when you finally get someone, you do nothing to keep them.  I can understand that cars have problems and that you shouldn't be able to just take them back.  But one of your dealers neglected to put oil in my new car and now it doesn't run properly.  What's the right thing to do?<br><br>
