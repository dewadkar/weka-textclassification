             I just received this camera from amazon.com. I earned the gift certificates online doing rewards programs. So I wanted to buy a digital camera. I didn't want to spend alot of money on one since I have a very nice 35mm Canon camera(which is also reviewed on epinions) I found the fuji 1200 listed on amazon and read several reviews that overall said the same thing &quot;Buy the camera&quot; So I bought it! 
 
 First of all the camera is very easy to use. I got it and didn't even have to read the instructions to get started. I just popped in the batteries and started setting it up right away. The LCD display is a very nice feature, my kids especially love it! I like the option to delete the pic after taking it or save it. Makes for less waste of card space. It's nice and compact which is great. Its nice not to have to bring a separate huge bag for the camera and all the film and so forth. When you have 3 kids you already have tons of stuff without having to drag along a bunch of camera equipment. 

 The software that comes with it (Adope PhotoDeluxe 3) Is very nice and easy to work with. I had version 2 of this software that came with my scanner but 3 is even better. I think the software that comes with the digital cameras are just as important as the camera itself. With this software you can make calendars, cards and much more. You can turn your pictures into black and white and edit things out of the pictures. You also have several options as to what file format you want to save them to. Its a great handy little program

 Now onto my suggestions. After reading a lot on amazon and here, When I bought my camera I got an extra 32mb card(It only comes with a 4mb) and I bought a Viking USB card reader. I would highly suggest anyone that is getting this camera to do the same. The USB reader is so quick and easy and its nice to have a bigger card so that I can save more pictures. The only other thing of course to recommend would be to buy rechargeable batteries. Though I have to say that with as much as I have used this camera so far my batteries are still holding up great! 

 I know one thing I tried to find when looking for a digital camera where pictures taken by the camera itself. Its nice to be able to see for yourself the quality of the pictures. Therefore, I'm going to show you the pictures I have taken so far. http://members2.clubphoto.com/stephanie206724/April_2000/  The link says April but the pics were just taken this September. All on this page were taken with the Fuji 1200. <br><br>
