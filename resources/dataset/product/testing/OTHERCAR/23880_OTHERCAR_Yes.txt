            I love my Mazda Millenia! It's a 1995 model, but the body style hasn't changed (unless they've changed it in 2000). It's plush leather seats make it an excellent car for long or short trips.  Mine has a sun roof which I really like because it opens two ways, it opens all the way up or you can just tilt up the back so you get both types of sun roofs in one.  The automatic climate control is very nice, you can keep the temperature a certain degree all the time instead of constantly fiddling with it.  It comes with all the nice features like electric windows/locks, electric mirrors, 6/8-way adjustable seats, etc.

The only two things I don't like about it are:

1) The cheap ass cup holders!  Not only are they flimsy and don't hold up (mine are already basically broken) but they're in a very bad spot to where you hit the cup with your knee all the time while driving. Being an avid Pepsi drinker (ok so I'm addicted!), I always have a Pepsi in hand, so this is a big deal to me :)

2) It's highback back seats are nice and comfortable for passengers riding in the back, but can make it rather difficult to see while backing up.  I have a small ding on the back bumper already because of this (and NO it wasn't me! Hubby did it hehe )<br><br>
