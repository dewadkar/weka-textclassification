            I just bought a 2000 Jeep Wrangler SE in September, and I love it.
It's fun to cruise in and go off-roading, but there are some negatives.
It's loud inside when driving over 55 miles per hour and bumpy.
But it's a Jeep. It's not supposed to be a smooth ride. It's designed for rugged outdoors off-roading. The point to riding in a Jeep is feeling all the bumps on and off the road. If I owned a luxury car and felt that I would be upset, but it's part of what a Jeep is.
What I like most is it's fun in warm weather to take the top down and drive and in bad weather it's great.
I used to have a Ford Mustang, and that car couldn't handle snow and ice at all.
This winter I didn't have to worry about road conditions at all. I just popped it into 4-wheel drive and went on my way passing cars that were stuck or had slid off the road.
Granted, I haven't owned my vehicle very long, but the dealership has been great so far. I get a letter every month asking me if I'm happy with my purchase and the Jeep's performance.
I also get Jeep newsletters that talk about upcoming events, like the Jeep Jamborees, and new models.
I think my money was well invested, plus the fact that usually cars lose their value where Jeeps don't as much. When I'm ready for my next vehicle I can sell my Jeep and not lose too much money on it.
