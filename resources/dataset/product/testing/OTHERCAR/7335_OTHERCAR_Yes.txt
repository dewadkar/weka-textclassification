            I learned to drive in a Triumph TR4, quite a roadster from the late-1960's. The Toyota MR2 Spyder is darned close, and much better in terms of safety features. I've yet to hit the 1,000 mile mark on mine so I have not tested its performance to the limit, but even so it is quite a blast to drive and easily goes wherever I want to go. Acceleration is crisp, steering is awesome. In a sports car of this type, one must forgo some conveniences such as cargo space and a certain degree of comfort. The seats are OK but if you are a large or tall person you will not enjoy the fit. Its like a tight T-shirt--either its fits you or it makes you uncomfortable. It fits me well! Be sure to test drive before you buy, just to make sure that it fits you. I had no problem finding a yellow ext./black int. (which is what I wanted) within a week at sticker price (CarMax). The silver/tan is not the best combination IMHO.

The engine is just right: good fuel economy yet high performance. Its quiet enough for normal conversation. An avid Porsche owner/friend looked it over and his comments included, "Look at the incredible size of those disc brakes!", and "It has even less cargo space than my 914."

Some have faulted the stereo system, but in a convertible you can't really expect good sound. Great sound belongs in your home, not in the MR2. The sound is entirely adequate, but frankly I'd rather listen to the engine and road when I drive, and save Mozart/Pink Floyd for home.

I rarely used cruise control when I owned cars that had it, so I don't miss it. This car gives exceptional performance but as always, its you're responsibility to keep it under control. And doing so will put a silly grin on your face, every time!

Update: Now that I've passed the 1,000 mile mark, I really am impressed with this little car. There are advantages to having little cargo space, but a rear-mounted luggage rack is available. The top is extremely easy to take down or put up. We had a tropical storm come through here today and the Spyder handled extremely well, as always, with absolutely no braking problems even after going through many, many deep puddles.
