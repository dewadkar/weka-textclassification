            I bought My 2000 Cavalier in August of 1999, It has done nothing since then But give me a head ache! I feel in love with it when i first seen it and wanted it more then any other car i looked at, But now i could really kick my self, It has been in the shop 8 times. Starting w/ the fact that my trunk does not close right, My service soon light has come on, I have had An O2 senor changed and My car cuts off for no reason in reverse, and the dealer's service center can not tell me why, I don't know if all the 2000 cavaliers are like this or not, But i would really think twice if i were you, about buying one. Take it home over night and test every little thing on it, Because now i am Suck w/ mine for 6 years. <br><br>
