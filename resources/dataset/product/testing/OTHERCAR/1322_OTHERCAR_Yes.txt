            I have had my pickup for a little over a year now and I still love it like the first day when I got it. I have had no problems with it. I did look at other manufactures, but the Silverado had more horsepower, better gas mileage, a better ride and more interior room. The 2000 Silverado is almost identical to the 1999.

<b>My 1999 Silverado </b>
 I got the 1999 Silverado LS 1500 Series 4x4 Short Bed in July 1999. Black with stainless steel wheels and a 327 motor with 270 HP. I added a bed liner and a lid to cover the bed. (The covered bed makes it a huge trunk.)

The seat look like bucket seats, very comfortable, the centerpiece can raise up so that a third adult can sit there. The centerpiece when laid down provides as a nice large storage compartment.

There is a nice large 2-cup holder that pulls from under the dash. There is your dome light, plus 2-swivel lights that you can turn on or off manually. (Nice for reading maps.)

<b>4x4 verses Z71</b>
The only difference in the Z71 package is it has off-road shocks and some tougher suspensions. I drive mine mainly on the blacktop, so I decided on the 4x4 over the Z71 because the 4x4 does ride a little better. The Z71 is a little stiffer. 

<b>The Warranty</b>
The 1999 Silverado Warranty is for Bumper-to-Bumper 36,000 miles or 3-years which ever comes first. Then there is 100,000 miles or 6-years on rust-through corrosion. Then you have Emission Control Systems Warranties that cover up to 80,000 miles or 8-years. (Not all Emission Control Systems have the full 8 years, some are for 50,000 miles or 5-years.)

<b>What to choose?</b>
1.	You have to figure out if you want a short bed, long bed or extended cab.
2.	2-wheel drive or 4-wheel drive.
3.	� ton (1500) or � ton (2500)
4.	Automatic or manual transmission.
5.	Four engines to choose from, one V-6 and three V-8's.
6.	Then you have to pick out your colors and what else to add on.

<b>Silverado LS 1500 standard equipment.</b>
This is what really surprised me! This is what was standard on the LS model I have.
1.	4-wheel ABS Brakes
2.	Two air bags. (You can turn the passenger one off.)
3.	Built in Burglar alarm and Theft deterrent ignition.
4.	Daytime Running Lights.
5.	Battery Run Down Protection. (After 20 minutes it will shut down things like your interior light if you accidentally left it on.)
6.	Driver Warning Message Center. (Very useful)
7.	Front and rear bumpers.
8.	24-hour roadside assistance.
9.	Intermittent Wipers.
10.	Gauges with a built in tachometer.
11.	3-DC outlets. (1 cigarette lighter and 2-empty.)
12.	Independent Front Suspension. (This is a plus on the 4-wheel drive models, it makes them ride so smooth.)
13.	Stainless Steel Exhaust System.
14.	Dual Power Mirrors. (I love these babies.)
15.	AM/FM CD player. (Sounds as good as any $300 to $400 ones that you can buy.)
16.	4-Built in speakers. 
17.	Stainless Steel Wheels.
18.	Cruise Control.
19.	Power Windows and door locks.
20.	Remote to unlock and lock the doors. (When using the remote, it automatically turns on or off the alarm.)
21.	Tilt Steering Wheel.
22.	Plus a lot more.

<b>Overall</b>
Overall it is a very dependable truck. Not only is it very attractive, it also has all the power you need. Gas mileage for this 4x4 is rated at 15 MPG in the city (I got 15.1 MPG) and 18 MPG on the highway. (I got 18.7 MPG)

Towing for my 4X4 with a 3.73 rear end and the 327 engine is rated at 6,500 lbs.

We did not get a lot of snow last winter, but it handled excellent in the snow. I always have to take my wife to work when it snows, (She does not like to drive on the snow.) but she felt safe taking my truck to work on the snow. 

I am very pleased with my 1999 Silverado LS 1500.
