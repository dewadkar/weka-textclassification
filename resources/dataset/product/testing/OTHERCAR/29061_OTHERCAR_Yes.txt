            Having only $800 to go down on a vehicle, I finally found a car I thought was a good deal. It was a 1992 Chevrolet Corsica with 62,000 miles.
After one month of owning this nice car and having a CD player installed in it, my Corsica was destroyed by a 70 year old woman driving a Ford F250.
This lady ran a red light and pulled out in front of me at a very busy intersection. I had slowed down to 40 from the speed limit of 45 because I had got a bad feeling she was about to come out in front of me. I was right! Just as soon as I got even with her white line, she &quot;gunned&quot; it in front of me. I had no time to brake and I had no time to go around her to avoid her if I wanted to. She was just there faster than I could blink! Cars were on both sides of my vehicle, also. 
When I made it out of my car, I walked to the front of it. You could not even recognize the once beautiful Chevy! She left tire marks on the remains of the hood! All of the engine parts were now inside the dash and the top of the car was folded back like a piece of notebook paper! 
I then, noticed I was hurting. My knees hurt, my breasts hurt, my mouth was busted-up, and my back was sore. 
I realized that the dash hit my knees, the airbag hit my breast and my mouth, and the force of the sudden stop shook up my back a little.
However, I was alive and I should not have been!
The Corsica held up enough so that I could survive. Everyone was running to hug me that had seen the accident because everyone thought that the driver of the car was dead! By all right, I should have been.
I have no doubt in my mind that if I was driving another car, I might have been. 
That white 1992 Chevrolet Corsica was the only reason I was alive!<br><br>
