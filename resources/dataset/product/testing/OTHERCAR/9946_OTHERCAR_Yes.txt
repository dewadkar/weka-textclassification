            I had got this car used in 1997 when my previous car (also a 94 Prizm) got t-boned and flipped over.  Car was great, I walked away with only scratches on my back from climbing out the shattered passenger window while the car was upside down, and the glass scratched me.

My car was in an accident before we bought it, the right side was smashed, but you can't tell unless you look down the side, and you see its just a touch off.  No one would know unless I told them.

I have an LSI model, had ~45k when we got it, has 145k miles now. My sister drove it for a while, and then it was turned over to me a year later.  No cruise or power windows or locks or OD, and I had the stereo replaced.  Its 1.6L engine is small, but peppy at low speeds, but trying to merge onto I-95 in the city, wish I had a couple more horses to spare. ;)

It is a wonderful little car, great for city/highway. (though I am hesitant to take it on really long trips, I did drive it up to Ocean City this summer, no problems).  Great little snow car, and is quite responsive when you need it.  Good MPG, I get 25-30 consistently, and that w/o overdrive. Also nice lines, especially with the alloy wheels that LSIs come with, looks real sharp when its clean and waxed.  Looks like a real car, but nothing more, but hey, what do you expect for the price.

Maintenence I have done, first was alternator a year after we bought it.  Manifold got a crack in it, had that replaced.  Then the catalytic converter died, and replaced that.  After that though, she ran fine for years.  I take mine to a local Firestone station that has been good to me (took it to a 5 Star GM Goodwrench service first....ppht, 5 star steal-ur-money, my alternator replacing was hell on earth, with them replacing my dead battery without me telling them, then wanting to charge me for the labor, this was after them putting a defective alternator in the first time).  I have had this car for 7 years.  Can't complain for the price (like $6k in 1997), and aside from normal maintenence like oil and had the muffler replaced once, it has been good to me.

Ran well until recently though, when I noticed the car shakes when I accelerate through 40-60, and when I make a right hand turn with gas. It did that for a little over a year. Well, I figured it was just the car getting long in the tooth....until it started making a really horrible scratching/knocking noise a couple weeks ago.  Turns out that shaking was the front axles all screwed up, and had to replace those (not cheap).  But my car runs like new now, like 5 years shaved off, and at least it wasn't the tranny *whew*.

Funny thing, I read another review here about the shaking, and the day a picked my car up, there was another EXACT Prizm like mine with the same problem.  So for all those with that, have your repair place take a look at the axles and bearings, maybe the shaking for over a year took its toll, so go check it out.

Overall, I put over 100,000 miles on mine, and with those new axles, runs real smooth, no shaking, plan on keeping it for several more years.  Runs much better than most 10 year old cars.  Just keep it maintained.
