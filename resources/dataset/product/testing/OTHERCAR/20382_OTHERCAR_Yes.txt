            I feel that the Corsica is an excellent buy, but not if you are doing a whole lot of travelling on the highway. We purchased our 1993 Corsica from a dealer in 1994 for $11,000 Canadian. It had been driven by a dealer for a year so it was in excellent shape. The only problem we found with it, was the lack of options on our model, so we had cruise control installed right away.

The things I like about our car are the ABS brakes. They work very well on our icy winter roads, but can be trusted all year round. I also like the driver's side air bag and the bumpers which can absorb some impact. These all help to make it a safer ride. We also get awesome gas mileage with our V6 on the highway, averaging over 37 mpg. 

The only real downside I see to the Corsica is it's lack of space. I do not feel that it can seat five people comfortably for any amount of time. It is too crowded all the way around in the back seat, especially for leg room. The middle rear seat also has a bump that sticks out a bit, making it uncomfortable on the back of the passenger.

Summed up, I find the Corsica to be a very good buy for the price you pay. I find it to be more comfortable, reliable, and safe than my 1993 Mercury Topaz, which I consider to be in the same class of cars. I would recommend this car to all drivers who don't go too far too often!<br><br>
