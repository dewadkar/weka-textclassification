            I recently traded my BMW 328i for the Infiniti G35.  I had 4 BMW's and I wanted something different - but I didn't want to sacrifice on quality or performance.  After having one for a few weeks, I'm glad to report that I the G35 was a good choice.  Of course, there's always something that can be improved, and I've included both the positive and negatives below:

Performance & Handling
The G35 handles very nimbly.  The braking is very smooth and sure.  The acceleration is also smooth with little transmission shifting. However, the car lacks low end torque - the acceleration comes all at once after the engine revs up.  I like off-the-line power and that is clearly missing.  Still, the acceleration at driving speeds is strong.

Trunk
The trunk space is ample and without some of the usual bizzare intrusions that make it diffcult to load suitcases.  There's also a ski bag pass through that might come in handy if I ever needed to carry skis.  However, the trunk lid is very difficult to close and requires a firm slamming to latch.

Instrumentation
Many find the amber illumination to be difficult to read.  I've never found that to be the case.  The dashboard is laid out logically and I find everything is easily spotted.  There are only to MAJOR exceptions.  The clock is pitiful and small and almost impossible to see.  Also the control in the steering wheel are not illuminated.  This makes the the cruise control at night very difficult to use!

Controls
I looked at a Q45 a couple years back and decided not to buy one because the controls were laid out badly.  There were too many buttons that had no intuitive function.  Gladly this was mostly eliminated from this car.  The only exception is the awful seat controls that are on top of the seat by each arm rest.  There are 4 switches that look like they operate the windows and one has to press one to figure out if it moves the seat up or down or backward or forward or reclines it.  What a huge hassle!

Interior
I think the seats are comfortable and the interior is pleasant.  Some do not like the seats.  They certainly are not as contoured as they could be, but they are nevertheless comfortable for me.  The back seats recline.  This is more boasting than usability since the reclined back seat goes from being somewhat cramped to somewhat unpleasant.
