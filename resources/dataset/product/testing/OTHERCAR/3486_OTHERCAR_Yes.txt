            Who can doubt that Subaru arguably has the best all-wheel drive system in the business? They've been making them for years and visit any mountain town in New England or Colorado and see what the locals drive!  In these harsh extreme climates, what is the point of owing a $40,000 fancy SUV with 4WD when it will still get stuck in the snow?  Subaru's symmetrical AWD system will not let you down and will get you to the mountain with out leaving a hole in your bank account every time you fill up.

I got my '2001 Outback Wagon used with just about 60,000 miles on it.  Despite the mileage, it still feels taught and does not have squeaks and rattles.  My car is equipped with the 2.5 liter horizontally opposed 4 cylinder and it does not have the vibration inherent to most four cylinder engines.  The engine produces about 165 hp, which won't break any speed records, but it also has more power and torque than some of its lesser competitors such as the Toyota Matrix/Pontiac Vibe (approx 120 hp).  The Subaru's engine has plenty of torque and has no problem cruising the freeways at 70-85 mph, even when fully loaded.  

Fuel economy is good, though not stellar, expect about 22-23 mpg city and 24-26 highway.  The AWD does give you a fuel penalty over a FWD car.   The 4 cyl. is mated to a 4-speed automatic trans. and that's also fine for city driving, although the auto seems to suffer in mountain driving as it keeps annoyingly shifting into a higher gear at too low an rpm forcing the driver to step on the gas to get it to downshift again. Whenever I drive this car in the mountains, it seems to be screaming "give me a 5-speed."

Passing power on 2 lane roads is not bad, On a recent ski trip, I passed 2-3 cars at a time or tractor trailers.  Again, it's not a race car.   The handling is good, although not as predictable as a RWD car and there is some torque steer on dry roads.  The anti-lock brakes work well and braking under dry, wet or snow is excellent.

The interior fit and finish are excellent, the front seats are very comfortable.  My Subaru came with some nice options including power heated mirrors, heated wipers which do melt the ice and electrically heated seats.  The heating and ventilation system are very efficient and your Outback will keep you warm and dry in all kinds of weather.  While the neighbors are busy scrapping and defrosting, you can start up your Subaru, flip a few switches and let the electrically heated wipers, mirrors and defrosters do the rest!  The sound system is adequate- barely.  A CD player is a notable omission in my 2001.

Interior leg and headroom are also very good, and the rear seat folds quickly and easily.  There is a center rear shoulder belt for a 3rd passenger.   Cargo space is very good, plenty of room for four skiers and all their fear for a weekend trip.

The Japanese have always excelled at the logical placement of controls and gauges and Subaru does not fail here either.  The dash is visually pleasing, the instruments are well placed and easy to read in daytime or at night time.  The instrument panel has an intuitive feel to it, unlike some domestic cars in which there are too many buttons or controls.  The instruments include a tachometer, which is probably more of a necessity on a manual transmission car, but it is still offered on the automatic.  The dash display also offers a thermometer, which in itself can be a safety feature.  The outdoor temperature will alert you to the possibility of wet roads or bridges icing.

Subaru has put together a great package for those who like the outdoors or on the go.
