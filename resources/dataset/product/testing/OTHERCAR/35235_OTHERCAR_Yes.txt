            We were looking at a Jeep Grand Cherokee when we saw the Trooper which had just had the body redesigned by Isuzu.  At the time, we knew very little about the Trooper.  The price was right and we needed a larger car.  We decided to take a chance.

What a winner!  We love this vehicle!  Since both my husband and I are very tall, immediately the greatest characteristic about the Trooper was the great headroom and legroom, even in the back.  The cargo space was ample for all the strollers and baby paraphernalia that we always took with us.  The seats are very comfortable and we have taken lots of long trips in the Trooper.  The kids manage to fall right asleep every time.

The dashboard was very intuitively arranged and everything is within reach of the driver.  The seats are extremely comfortable despite limited combinations of seat adjustments.  I can't rave enough about this vehicle.

The only minor criticism that I have (which my husband does not share with me- he thinks it's not an issue) is that when sitting in the back seat, there is a little road noise detectable through the corner of the window, but only on the right side.  Probably nothing a little caulk around the window can't fix.

When driving this car, due to the higher center of gravity, it feels like you are in a very secure truck.  There is no rattling of any kind and it feels solid and smooth.  Cornering is no different than any other truck or SUV and despite the reports indicating that a Trooper is more likely to roll over, I have not found that to be the case.  I have driven other vehicles that felt more likely to roll than the Trooper.  When driving, engine noise is almost non-existent. The suspension is such that road bumps and inconsistencies are almost not noticeable.  Our truck is now six years old and it still feels and drives like the day we took delivery.

I would recommend the Trooper to families that are on the go.  We have taken it off road and on the beach and it's great.  It has the best gas mileage for its class, however it can be a hefty gas bill if what you're accustomed to is a passenger car.  Therefore, it would not suit families on a very tight budget.

In the six years of ownership, besides the regular maintenance, it's only been in the shop once for brakes, and that was after 65K miles.

You can't beat the Trooper!<br><br>
