I have an Audi A4 and notice they are getting quite popular.  Well, I have had mine for 30K miles.  Mine is the Quattro (4x4) with a 2.8 engine Tiptronic Trans (auto) and leather interior. I couldn't be happier with the car.  The service record is excellent, the car drives great.  I am 100% sold on Audi.

The car drives great, I happen to love the Tiptronic transmission, that is the automatic with the ability to upshift and downshift without use of a clutch.  The 2.8 engine has plenty of pickup on freeways and great top speed.  It is hard to not speed up 280 to San Fran, the car is so smooth at speed.

Even though the car cost $33K, I think it has been a great value. The first 3 years of service is included. And generally the Audi dealers have great service with shuttle service and coffee and such niceties.

The Quattro feature has been very handy in going to Lake Tahoe and not worrying about chains requirements.  The car handles very well in the snow and doesn't look stupid like a big SUV on every day usage. 

Now the only downsides, first is the wind sound at speeds above 75 MPH, which I don't recommend as that would be illegal.  But you can hear wind blowing over the sideview mirrors.

The lack of easily usable drink holders is an inconvenience.  And finally the Air Conditioner controls are not easy to use.  There is no on/off button, you have to hit the '+' or '-' button a number of times to shut off the AC.

Overall I think the Audi A4 is one of the best cars on the market in quality and features for the price.

One other thing, the car is really the best of sporty and luxury available in one car.<br><br>
