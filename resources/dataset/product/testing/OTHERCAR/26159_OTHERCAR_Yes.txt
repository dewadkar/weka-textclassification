                 We needed the space of a minivan and I reluctantly agreed.  We looked at several makes and narrowed it down to the Chrysler Town & Country and the Sienna.  I really liked the amenities and room of the Chrysler and my wife really liked the Sienna.  On the way to buy one or the other, radio reports announced recalls on the Chrysler for all sorts of major and minor problems, followed by a report that Chrysler had been found to be reselling as new vehicles vans they had taken back under NY's Lemon Law.  We went to Toyota and bought the Sienna.  That was two years ago.

     We are completely pleased with the Sienna and I don't have any complaint, except that it should be bigger.  The engine and transmission work effortlessly and gas mileage is good.  The ride is smooth and comfortable.  I actually drove at 95-100 for some time without noticing.  I have rarely driven that fast and I remember feeling it, but not in this vehicle.  It handles as easily and quietly and smoothly at that speed as it does at 30.

     The vehicle has held up nicely and we have had no problems with factory quality.  The van now has 20,000 miles.  I'm confident that it will get me anywhere a road will take me without a problem, and I'm confident that I will be able to resell it after several years for much much more than I would have been able to resell any Chrysler that I might have bought.

     We highly and readily recommend the Sienna, even though its rear seat doesn't fold into the floor.  The seats are easily removed if need be and that's rarely anyhow.  And I've been reading other reviews here about the Odessey's uncomfortable seats, which is the opposite of my experience with the Sienna's seats. I've sat in all of them for considerable distances at a clip.

     
     If you're going to buy a van, look no further than your unfriendly Toyota dealer.  That's the downside to Toyota.  But hey, you're not buying the dealer. . .
