            The 2000 VW Beetle is NOT the 1971 VW Beetle I am familiar with. Even with the baskets on the doors, the OH-SH*T straps, and the beautiful round body. The oddest thing about the car is the clicking sound of the turn signal comes from the center of the dashboard.

PROS: the car looks good! The speed and handling are excellent for a car in it's price range. The cassette/radio sounds fantastic. The dash lights are nice neon red and blue. The seats are comfy and placed in the center of the car (front to back). Gas mileage is fantastic. the door handles are great. tight suspension. vanity mirrors. at least 4 cup holders. at least 3 12V power outlets. it's quiet. the seats move up-down-forward-back. Smooth ride. Flower holder. It's got FIVE forward gears!!!
The car smiles at you! 

CONS: everytime i get out of the car, i get static electricity shock- but it may be my shoes. the non-turbo model does not have the pickup i expected (me- the porsche lover). The doors automatically lock at 10mph which is something that i will get used to. the center console prevents three of the cup holders from supporting large cups. no cigarette ligher or ashtray.

NEUTRALS: my old '71 Bug had no dashboard at all. The new bug has the largest i've seen outside of a mini-van, you could sleep on the dash board! 

WISHES: turbo diesel convertible and fuzzy steering wheel cover.

WISH-NOTS: nothing!<br><br>
