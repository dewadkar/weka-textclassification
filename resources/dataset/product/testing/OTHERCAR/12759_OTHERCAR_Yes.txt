            The MX-2700 is my second digital camera, and I have to admit it, I bought it for the size.  Lugging around one of those &quot;brick&quot; sized digital cameras is not attractive when you are an active traveller.  Once I started snapping photos, I was even more impressed.

The specs (straight from Fujifilm's site):
2.3 Million Pixels
1,800 x 1,200 Print Resolution
Removable, Reusable SmartMedia Memory Card (8MB included)
2x Digital Zoom
Rechargeable Lithium-Ion Battery
2-inch Color LCD Viewing Monitor
Lightweight Aluminum Alloy

This camera will fit into most pockets, which is a big bonus.  Outdoor photos are fantastic, I have taken some wonderful shots that I have made  5x7 prints that are the same quality as a 35mm print.  

Indoor shots are bit less in quality.  I have seen some fuzziness with indoor shots that are far away.  Also, photos turn out a bit dark indoors.  The camera warns you if the pictures are going to be low quality, so you can adjust the shutter speed to catch more light.

The battery lasts a long time if you don't overuse the monitor.  I have taken up to 150 pictures and still had &quot;juice&quot; left over.  The battery can take up to 8 hours to charge if it is really low.

The controls are relatively intuitive, but if you have big hands, you might have trouble adjusting the dials and pushing the buttons.  

There are many very neat features on the camera.  You can convert photos directly to black and white, zoom in while reviewing, auto timer, and other nice stuff.  You can manually set options, or use the auto functions to take sharp pictures. 

Compared to it's competition, I think this camera holds up very nicely.  The Kodak 280 takes equally as good pictures, but is almost twice the size.

The Pros:
The size of the camera is the biggest plus.  You can carry it any where.
The photo quality of outdoor pictures is fantastic
The photos store quickly onto the disc
The battery lasts a long time and is rechargeable
Comes with Adobe Photoshop Home Edition, which is a very easy to use, quality software product.

The other great thing about this camera is the look.  It is always a conversation starter.  No one can believe a great digital camera is so small and has good looks.

The Neutrals:
Indoor pictures are just ok unless you have a lot of lighting
It only comes with an 8 MB card; upgrade to 32 MB and be happy!
Controls are small; may be difficult to manipulate
Does not come with a case (buy one at Walmart for $6)

The Cons:
No optical zoom
No USB (I use a flashpath adapter to load pictures quickly)

Overall, a fantastic camera for the active traveller.
