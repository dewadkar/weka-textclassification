            I purchased this automobile because I thought GM had finally solved some 
of the problems with the transmission and air conditioning that I had
experienced in the 1970'and 1980's.  The car looks good and has good
instrumentation.  The downside of the appearance and the features 
is that nothing works very long.  The CD player and the cassette player
went out at about 52000 miles.  The mileage range computer is completely unreliable. I have run out of gas two times when the computer indicated
I had mileage left. Pieces fall off the car, such as the wheel covers.
The power locking system fails to work most of the time.  The metal in
the body is flimsy and is very easily dented. I hsve replaced the starter
two times at a cost of about $800.  The &quot;SERVICE ENGINE SOON&quot; light 
comes on every time I drive the car.  The Oldsmobile dealer service
department have been unable to give me an explanation or fix on the
problem after several service calls.
This car is basically worn out at 85,000 miles, even though it has
not reached that level of mileage yet.  If this is as good as the
US automakers can offer, they need to give up.     <br><br>
