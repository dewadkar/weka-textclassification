              All of my life I wonted a Jeep Wrangler, well in 1998 my husband allowed me to purchase one.  It was dark green, the Sahara edition and a hard top (we purchased a safari top for it).  It was a dream come true, I loved it!  My kids, especially my  7 year old daughter, loved to go for rides in it with the top off.

  I had a great time driving my Jeep, but it soon proved to be a rough ride.  The very limited space was difficult whenever you did any shopping and once I had a leaky tire and I kept telling my husband to fix it, but he never had time. One day I was driving home from work and took a right turn a little to quick and felt the Jeep start rocking (but thanks to my dad's information when he taught me to drive), I simply took my foot off the gas and the Jeep slowed down and leveled off.  Let me tell you now, as soon as I go home and changed my clothes, me and my 10 year old son changed that tire immediately.

  I would recommend A Jeep Wrangler to anyone who loves to feel like you can climb anything or go anywhere, but please if you have small children, use your best judgement for there safety.  I know that you watch out for your kids, but someone could turn in front of you all and cause you to slam on the brakes and you would probably go into a roll-over. With kids or not in the Jeep could prove to be a very serious accident for anyone.
That's probably the only bad thing about Wrangler's that I can think of, is the high ratio for roll-over's.<br><br>
