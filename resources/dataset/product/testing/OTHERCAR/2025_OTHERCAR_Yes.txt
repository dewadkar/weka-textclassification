            In November of 1999, I bought a 2000 Grand Marquis for my company employees to drive.  As of the end of October, we had just over 100,000 miles on the car, and have had absolutely no problems with the car at all. I've had the car out on long road trips on 3 seperate occasions.  It handles very well in heavy traffic, accelerates and performs very nicely, and to top it all off, it has averaged an unbelievable and impressive 25 miles to the gallon since it was bought new.  I've had cars with v-6's in them that did not do this well.  The interior space of this car is certainly enough to comfortably seat up to 6 full sized adults, and just about all of the luggage they could carry to the car, will fit as well. I did buy the LS Model, with the plush leather seating, deep dish alloy wheels, and dual stainless steel exhaust.  I had never been able to fall asleep in a moving vehicle prior to purchasing this one, but now, on long road trips, I am able to catch a few zzzzz's, which certainly helps!  I really love the way the car handles on the open road, as well as in heavy traffic.  I am never afraid to get out in front of the traffic, because it handles so well, and runs so strongly that I have no worries.  I really enjoy the heated leather seating as well, on those cold nights while traveling, they seem to work rather well.  The climate controls are close to the driver, and easy to read, as are the radio function controls. The dash and gauges are laid out very nicely, in an easy to read, at a glance sort of way, and the digital instrument panel is very nice and is easy on the eyes after 10 hours of driving, it has a dimmer switch, that allows one to dim the dash lights just to the perfect level. 
The finish on the car is outstanding as well, we've waxed this car one time, and that was right after I first bought it, and it has held it's shine to date, just as if it were still new.  I had a Lincoln Town Car the last time, and was disappointed with the handling, fuel mileage, comfortability, and last, but not least, it's reliability.  NOT with this Mercury!  I will certainly be purchasing another one soon, I could not be happier with a car than I've been with this one.  This is certainly a car for anyone who does an abundance of traveling long distances via the car. It would perfect for the average family, as the sticker is not any more than any of the comparable automobiles out there, and it is far more comfortable than any of the others as well, and will most likely out-perform any of the others out there in almost every way there is!  There are a few disadvantages to this car however, it is rear wheel drive, so it is not the best in snow or heavy rain (although it is equipped with the control-trac system), and parking it in your average garage is difficult due to it's size.  When the engine is put under any abnormal amount of strain, it tends to use a very small quanity of oil (just started recently), and tires for this car are very expensive when they have to be replaced.  I had to replace the original factory tires at 23,000 miles due to slipped belts in all four of them, and due to the tread wear, they were not covered under the warranty.  The fuel safety system is easily tripped as well, if you hit a decent sized bump in the highway, it shuts the fuel off, you then have to go to the trunk of the car, take your luggage out on the side of the highway, and press the reset button, this happened 22 times to us.  When involved in a severe front-end collision, the car held up very well, everything was crunched in the front, except there was not a scratch from the front of the front doors on to the back of the car (which impressed me).  The car has held it's value extremely well.  I plan to trade this one in on a new one sometime in February of 2001, and by then, we will have about 125,000 miles on it.  This car is highly recommended!  Happy buying!!!!<br><br>
