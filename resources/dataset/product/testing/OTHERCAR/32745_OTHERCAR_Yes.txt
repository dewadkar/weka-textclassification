            Who couldnt love the neck snapping power coming from the all-aluminum LS1??  The Camaro even rides like a dream considering the sporty suspension and handling is emmaculate.  The interior is flawless especially when decorated with the leather option.
 
However I feel the front clip is just plain ugly.  Just look at the front end of those new Chysler Concorde's and you will see amazing similarities.  I like the 93-97 style a little better.

Every car has its flaws and Camaro and Firebirds have for the most part always have had rear seating problems because of space.  Kids are comfortable but adults are kinds of squished.  Another problem is traction during certain weather conditions including ice and snow.  If you use a little to much throttle the rain can be hazardous as well.  Though perhaps the 6 cylinder model does not have traction problems in these conditions considering they have 100 less horsepower.

This car is for all ages:
Young kids wanting a cool and fast ride
Married couple's with young children
Older folks who want to enjoy life and feel young again<br><br>
