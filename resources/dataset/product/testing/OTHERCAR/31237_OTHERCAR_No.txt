            This car has a serious problem with the design of the gas gauge.  Never in my life have I run out of gas more often than when driving this car.

First of all, there is no warning signal of any kind when gas is running low.  Is it really that difficult or expensive to install a warning light?  Every other car I've ever driven has had a low gas warning light in the dash... it's just a basic feature!

Second, the gas gauge movement is not linear... it's exponential.  There are five markers on the gauge as expected... lines that mark empty, 1/4 full, 1/2 full, 3/4 full, and full.  They don't mean what they should mean.  When the indicator reaches 3/4 full, you are really about 1/2 full.  When it reaches 1/4 full, watch out!

I'll be driving to work in the morning and I'll notice that the gauge reads 1/4 full... in any other car this would be no problem, I'll get some gas when I leave work in the evening.  Five minutes later, I'm at work.  After work, I get in the car and start to drive home.  After about 5 minutes I see the gauge is below empty and I'm about to stall!  This p*sses me off every single time it happens and it happens a lot.

I just can't get used to an exponential gas gauge.  And a simple low gas warning light would have saved me many miles of walking with a gas can in hand.<br><br>
