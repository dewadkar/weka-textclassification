            Not only is the 3000GT beautiful from the outside, but its interior and handling amaze me even more.  Look below at my detailed description of the wonderful car, from what I have seen.

When I first saw this car, I was amazed at its outside looks.  It was one of the best looking cars I had ever seen! I remember the first model I ever saw, it was whitish grey with the side moldings and some custom rims.  I was at a stop light beside it, and when I was in my Mazda MX6 and attempted to race it, well, it blew me away.  Not sure if this was the VR4 (FASTTTTT) but this car literally burned me!  My car does 0-60 in about 15 seconds and the 3000GT beside me was atleast 5 cars ahead of me after about 6 seconds.  I couldn't believe what I saw.

Later on, I got to see the interior of this car.  I loved the seats because they made me feel so comfortable.  The back was cramp but it's ok because its a sports car!  My friend had installed a simple bazooka bass tube inside the trunk and the design of the 3000GT made the small bass tube sound SO great!

I LOVE THIS CAR!<br><br>
