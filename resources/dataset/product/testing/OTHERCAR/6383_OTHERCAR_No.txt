            I have driven my father's 1995 Dodge Ram 2500 (4x4, V-8, Lariat package, standard cab) for some time.  This is a fun truck to drive (high visibility, powerful, rugged) but it lacks reliability.  This is one of the first of the &quot;new style&quot; Dodge trucks to come off the line in the mid-90s so this may explain its reliability problems.  It has required repairs more frequently that average.  Many components in the cab have prematurely failed (handle strap - FIXED TWICE AND STILL IT FAILED, radio problems, light problems, etc.).  I hope that Dodge has remedied these problems.  Since most of the other major auto manufacturers have jumped on to the &quot;huge&quot; pickup truck bandwagon, I would recommend checking out the Ford full-size before buying the Dodge.  I RECOMMEND THE CUMMINS TURBO DIESEL ENGINE FOR THE DODGE - VERY RELIABLE.<br><br>
