               I have had my KD-500Z almost 2 months now and am now ready to talk about it.  This is my second Digital with the first being a Toshiba PDR-M1(a 1.5mp 2x dig.zoom only).  While I enjoyed this camera for about 3+ years, it didn't take me long to shelve it when I started using the new Konica.
   The KD-500Z has many features that I don't use on a frequent basis. The white balance and slow shutter just to name a couple.  I have experimented with these features as well as the sound features, but to be honest, this camera is so good at taking pictures that the auto settings for most pictures is just fine.
   I had some prerequisites for my replacement and this unit did not disappoint.  First, people take "snapshots", which are usually spontaneous and last minute.  I wanted a fast starter.  I can take a picture about 1.5 seconds after I open the lens cover. I can take another picture in another 2.5 seconds.  I also wanted a bigger file size so that when I get the photos that I want to have printed(I've tried Walmart and Office Max so far), I can have quality photos at much larger size.  I have gotten several 8x10's and the quality is amazing!  My 1.5MP would have been much grainier at that size. 
   The camera is small, fast, easy to use, and precise.  The camera downloads via USB with the included cable.  The battery which is proprietary(fits this camera and maybe other Konicas only), lasts like other digital cameras. Those of you who have used a digital camera for any time at all know what I am talking about.  The included li-lon cell pops in and out with ease, and you cannot put it in wrong(its keyed).  The included charger gives another full load of say 110 shots(flash and monitor on) every 45 minutes.
   The bottom line is that even with all the extras; the 30 second video with sound, the two different recording media types..(secure digital & memory stick), the 3x optical and 4x digital zooms(seamless if desired), the two stage self-timers, the focus options, and the color menu screens complete with sound fanfare, THIS CAMERA TAKES INCREDIBLE PICTURES!!
   I bought an extra 128mb memory stick which complemented the included 16mb secure digital card(almost worthless for a high MP camera like this).  I bought an extra battery($39) and a soft case($15) both of which I would recommend.
With the $410 dollar Revio and accessories, my grand total was under $500 and I received some super software from the dealer like photoshop and photo illustrator. I have ditched the 16mp SD for a much larger 256MB SD card and can take about 185 nonstop pictures at the best resolution before I need to offload to my hard drive.  Why take pictures in full resolution?  The price is the same at the photoshop for prints whether you have a 1.5MP or a 5+MP file.  But without all the artifacts, the pics are very impressive.
