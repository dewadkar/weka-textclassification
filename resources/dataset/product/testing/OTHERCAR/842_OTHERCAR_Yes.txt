            I truly believe this statement. The Nissan 300ZX really <i>does</i> provide the enthusiast with (by far) the most bang for your buck in a genuine sports/GT car.

Before I continue, allow me to present my credentials: I am a freelance automotive journalist (published in Road &amp; Track magazine, etc.), and I am what is generally referred to as a genuine &quot;car guy&quot;.  I have had all manner of automobiles in my life, ranging from 4-door family transportation to all-out sports and luxury cars.  My opinion of the 300ZX is based both on real-world experience as well as the results of countless (literally hundreds) of hours of research into the very essence, nature and being of the immortal Z, one of my all-time favorite cars.

There really is nothing like driving a Z <i>--any Z.</i>  Even a normally-aspirated, base-model 1984 300ZX is an attractive, comfortable and entertaining GT.  My first in-depth personal experience with a Z came back in 1993 when I bought a (literally) mint-condition 1985 Nissan 300ZX Turbo for $5,000 in cash.  After months of searching, I found the &quot;perfect&quot; Z.  It was black with tan leather, and in truly exceptional (original) condition.  Three seconds into the test drive, I floored the pedal.  The rest, as they say, is history... I was instantly smitten.  Little did I know that the love affair was to last a lifetime.  Although I no longer own that particular Z, I [to this day] admire and lust after the Z.

The first generation (Z31) 300ZX offered (very) exciting styling, outstanding performance and handling, phenomenal reliability (for a sports car), and all the enjoyment, prestige, and yes, traffic tickets that come with owning one of the world's finest performance automobiles.  The original 300ZX (1984-1989) was available in several flavors:

- Base, 2-seat hatchback; 160hp 3.0L V6 (165hp in 1988-1989)
- 2+2 hatchback; 160hp 3.0L V6 (165hp in 1988-1989)
- Turbo 2-seat hatchback; 200hp turbocharged 3.0L V6 (205hp in 1988-1989)

There were many options, ranging from the fully digital dash to glass T-tops, a rear spoiler, leather, adjustable suspension, automatic transmission, etc.  A few special models were offered: in 1984, a special edition &quot;Anniversary&quot; 300ZX Turbo with fender flares, special badging, and a special &quot;Bodysonic&quot; stereo system was offered.  In 1988, the much sought-after SE (Special Edition) was produced in very limited numbers, offering a fantastic sport-tuned suspension, analog guages, Recaro racing seats, and body-colored (white) wheels.

Today, excellent examples of the AE (Anniversary Edition) and SE (Special Edition) cars are easily worth double what &quot;normal&quot; cars of the same vintage are worth.  Ten or twenty years from now such vehicles will undoubtedly be prized collectibles.

The last generation of the Z (Z32) to be built (to date) was a truly original design, offering the discriminating enthusiast a healthy balance between sport and luxury.  The car became the benchmark against which all other sports cars were measured.  Many other companies tried to imitate the phenomenal success of the Z32, but none ever managed to do so.  Even today, when set against the likes of much newer designs, the 1990-1996 300ZX still looks fantastic and performs extremely well.

From 1990 to 1996, the Z was offered in the same three variants: a 2-seat coupe equipped with a 222 hp 3.0L V6, a 2+2 with the same engine, and the 2-seat, top-of-the-line twin-turbocharged car offering 300hp and 4-wheel steering. In 1993 a 2-seat, normally-aspirated convertible model was added to the lineup, although it was never offered with the twin-turbos (a major faux-pas, in my opinion).

The car to own is definitely the twin-turbo.  This beast rockets from a standstill in a little over 5 seconds, and corners almost as well as a Ferrari.  This car has a masive, cult-like following, even now --almost 5 years since it left Nissan showrooms for good.  There are a great number of websites and fan clubs devoted solely to Z worship.  If you are interested, check out twin-turbo.net and 300Z.com.  Fans of the first generation 300ZX (Z31) can check out Z31.com.

Dating back to the original 240Z, the formula has always been the same: a powerful, front-engine, rear-drive hatchback with great handling and admirable acceleration/braking capabilities.  Spanning nearly three decades, the evolution of the Z car consistently added more of three things to the formula with each generation of the car: weight, power, and of course, price.

When it was first conceived, the Z offered better performance than a Porsche for about 1/3 the price.  By the time it went out of production in 1996, the twin-turbo could still match the performance of a normally-aspirated Porsche 911, but the price had risen to more than one-half that of the Porsche; too much for the average enthusiast to realistically afford.

However, these days, used 300ZXs are a steal on the used car market.  Supply is plentiful, and only the various limited editions carry a premium price tag.  Most notably, the aforementioned 1984 AE and the 1988 SE, and of course, the last year of the 300ZX (1996) all fetch considerable sums (if in pristine condition).

Bugs to watch for:

If purchasing a first-generation Z, I strongly advise you to go for a turbo model. The extra 40 horsepower is very noticable, and well worth the extra cash.  However, all first-generation Z cars are plagued with the same (potentially disasterous) problem: The fuel injectors do not get along well with the newer (introduced in 1993) oxygenated gasolines.  If they have never been changed (highly unlikely), change them immediately.  They will also have to be replaced periodically (about every 40,000 miles), as the seals eventually wear out.  Failure to do so can (and probably will) result in a very dangerous engine fire.  I urge you to speak with a certified Nissan mechanic for detailed information about this.

Other things to keep your eyes open for in the first-generation cars are: malfunctioning digital dash units (these are a fortune to replace), and rusted components in the rear.  The tail lights leak water into the hatch area, often resulting in a disintegrated floor.  As well, watch for dead suspension components in the rear.  This is easy to spot: you will notice the rear wheels angle in at the top.

In the second-generation (Z32) cars, the single most important thing to wach for is the timing belt.  It <b>MUST</b> be changed every 60,000 miles, and demand proof that it has been.  The potential results of not changing it on time could well cost you thousands of dollars to repair (think valve job, new pistons, etc.).  Also, keep your eyes out for bad Bose stereos, bad climate control systems, and bad automatic transmissions on the 1990 cars.  The timing belt interval is the same (60K miles) for the Z31, by the way --and just as important.

Other than these things, the Z is a phenominally reliable car.  Treat one well, do the maintenance religiously (as you should with any car), and you will be rewarded with years of driving pleasure.  When shopping around, keep your eyes peeled for signs of obvious neglect, or outright abuse.  Stay away from any car that has been lowered more than 3/4 of an inch or so, as the incredibly harsh ride resulting from this will significantly shorten the life of the car (any car).

One of the best things about the 2nd generation (Z32) Z cars is that they are very easy to modify.  A few hundred dollars will easily net you an extra 60 hp on a Twin Turbo Z, and a few thousand can easily get you 450-500hp <i>without</i> the use of nitrous oxide.

The first generation (Z31) cars are harder to modify, with the cost per gain being significantly greater.  It is not so much the cost per hp, but the comparative performance gain I am speaking of.  The car weighs a lot, and the 200hp in the stock engine configuration is a <i>lot</i> less than that found in the second generation twin-turbo.  The cost to modify a (factory turbocharged) car to 300hp is (very) significant, in the area of about $3,000 or so.

Overall, it's tough to find a better used-sports car bargain than a Z in good condition.  All are comfortable and fun to drive, and the bang-for-your-buck factor is fantastic.  Also, all are rear-wheel drive, a major factor if you appreciate excellent, predictable-at-the-limit dry-roads handling.

What I love: Everything.  No kidding.  :-)
What I hate: Normally aspirated first-generation 300ZXs are underpowered.
