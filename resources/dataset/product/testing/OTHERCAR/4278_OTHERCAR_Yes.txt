            I used to own a 1974 Super Beetle.  When I heard they were reintroducing the bug with an engine in the front, I was wary.  However, I bought a used 2000 turbo beetle a few months back.  Local owner with only 35,000 miles.  Got a great price and it was a turbo model to  boot!  
My first test drive was all it took.  Well actually, I had driven a few others but the turbo model was really a step up.  When you get past the 1 second turbo lag, this buggy moves!  I looked down as I left the interstate ramp and saw 90 on the speedometer with no shake or shimmy!

This car has a lot of neat stuff on it.  At 93mph a spoiler on the back rises.  You can also manually raise it with a hidden switch under the dash.  The warning systems on this car are loud and clear!  (One note, when you hear the chime for "low gas," head to the nearest station!  You've got about 12 miles in the tank!)  There's a little pocket over the driver's shoulder to hold your sunglasses.  Cup holders can be placed in the middle armrest.  Lots of instrumentation for a small car.  

The seats in the front are large and roomy.  The headroom is even more than my Nissan Maxima.  The moonroof option has "stops" so that you can choose the position where you want the roof to open or close to.

I have added several options to my bug, of which there are legion on the website.  "Bugmods" are everywhere and can help you personalize your beetle.  I added a rear wing, mud flaps and guards, european taillights and a new stereo system.  

Now for the the major con.   There is a back seat, but you better have small folks in it.  I'm only 5'7", and my head is bumping the roof in the back seat!  Just buy it like a two-seater, and you'll be fine.

Gas mileage is also not great around town.  I'm averaging a mediocre 23 mpg.  Highway came out to about 30mpg.  The city mpg is low for a car this size.  It also uses midgrade gas which increase your cost.

Overall, this is a fun and fast car to drive.  It gets a lot of looks still, since it's a great throwback to an earlier day.  Thanks VW for bringing back a classic!
