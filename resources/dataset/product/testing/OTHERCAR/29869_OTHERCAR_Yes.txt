            I have been in the market for a digital camera for a while now. I settled on this one because of it's ease of use and great quality pictures.
The quality of the photos was amazing. Even without enhancing them with Photoshop, I was able to print out great looking photos straight on through. I figured there would be some pixelation to them, but you really can't tell unless you look up close. I've hung these pictures on the wall, and no one knows they are taken from a digital camera.

One concern I had about buying a digital camera, was how to get the pictures off the camera and into the computer. I bought a 20 MB card for it and a reader which plugs into my parallel port for this purpose. Both were relatively inexpensive. Now I can hold like 150 decent sized shots on it. Very cool.

I don't have too many regrets, although I do wish the price wasn't so high. I guess that's what you get for buying a good product. I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to take great pictures, but also would recommend that they get some kind of reader for the digital film. It saves on batteries and is really quick (acts like a separate drive on your computer).<br><br>
