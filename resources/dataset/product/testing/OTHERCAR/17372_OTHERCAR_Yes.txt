              Since their introduction in 1989 as '90 models, the turbocharged powered Mitsubishi Eclipse's have been a blast to drive. While the early models might not have been very reliable, Mitsubishi made major improvements between 1995-1999. 1999 is the last year for these 4-cylinder racers known as the Eclipse GS-T and GSX. Today their successor is powered by a V6, and a naturally asperated 4-cylinder in base trim. Ironically the V6 does not offer the performance of its smaller engined predecessor.

   For the '99 Model year the Eclipse came in 6 trim lines, and offered 3 different engines. The base models were powered by a 140 horsepower 2.0 4 cylinder, the GS spyder convertible had a 141 horsepower 2.4 liter that produced more torque to move its extra weight, and both the GS-T and GSX sported a 2.0 DOHC 16 valve turbocharged power plant that puts out a whopping 210 horsepower and 214 lb-ft of torque.

<i>Driving Impressions:</i> 


Having driven a '97 model (see review), there really is not much improvement in the <b>performance</b> department. By 1997 Mitsubishi had refined this small, 2.0 turbocharged engine as much as possible. With a Garret T3 turbocharger bolted to the 4-cylinder engine, the Gs-T coupe feels very fast off-the-line, especially for a small car. In-fact the 1999 Eclipse Gs-T was one of the most powerful, and fastest cars in its class. The 1999 Eclipse is not only strong off-the-line, it also offers very strong acceleration in top gear, and provides more than adequate power for hill climbing. The 5-speed manual transmission is not the smoothest, but it does offer easy shifting, and short throws. Even with 30,000 original miles on the clutch, I did not have a problem up-shifting, nor down-shifting. The Eclipse is also an excellent handler. The 1999 Eclipse feels taut, sure-footed, nimble, and offers very responsive steering, although under full throttle you will undoubtedly notice significant torque steer, beings this is a FWD vehicle. Braking is also excellent, My test GS-T coupe came with 4 wheel disc ABS which is an option on this model, and standard on the GSX. The GSX model also boasts AWD. 

<b>NOTE:</b> Expect to get around 30 mpg while doing freeway driving with the 'GS-T' matched with the 5-speed manual. 

   The Gs-T rides on a 98.8" wheelbase, and has the same unitary construction, and multi-link <b>suspension</b> as the lesser models, but adds a stiffer, more competitive suspension setup, with thicker anti-roll bars both front and rear.  

   <b>About the engine:</b> Displacing only 2.0 liters, the 1999 Eclipse Gs-T makes 210 horsepower at 6,000 RPM, and 214lb-ft of torque at 3,000 RPM. This large amount of power is thanks to a Garret AiResearch T3 turbocharger, which runs a maximum boost of 14.5 psi. 

<i>Interior Accommodation:</i> 
 
 The <b>interior</b> of the 1999 Eclipse, besides being a little on the tight side, is 'world class.' The Eclipse's interior is very well laid out, the GS-T Comes standard with a boat load of equipment. Just to name a few amenities, my test GS-T coupe came with a 6 speaker CD player, cruise control, power everything, tilt, and a thick leather wrapped steering wheel.  Dual Airbags are standard, and so is a power sunroof. The drivers position, despite what many say, I found quite accommodating. The leather trimmed seats were not the best in quality, but offered loads of support and comfort. The 2 2 configuration provides adequate room up front, but like many sports cars, including the Mustang, and Camaro, the rear seats are comfortable for children only, and very small adults. Compared to the 1st generation Eclipse's, the 1999 model feels like a Lincoln town Car in terms of room.

<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

   The <b>exterior</b> of the Eclipse was fully redesigned in 1995, and given a face lift in 1997 where it received a new front fascia design, which features cool looking air vents, and fog lights. The Eclipse, even today has modern and appealing styling. The spoiler has become a little 'too much' over the years, but despite a big rainbow looking spoiler in the rear, this car looks both aggressive and sexy. The bulge on hood of the turbo models adds even more appeal.

  <b>Price & reliability</b>  New, the 1999 Eclipse GS-T ran for around $23,000. Which was not a bad deal considering it could keep up with cars like the '96-98 Mustang GT's in outright performance. Today, a '99 GS-T will set you back about $16,000, or even less. As for reliability, since 1995, these cars have got mixed reviews, some have had virtually no problems with them, and others have had many. Before you decide on a purchase, please check out Consumer Reports, or ask around.


<i>Final Thoughts:</i>

Although this car is obviously not for everybody, it is the epitome of small engine, racer car fun. With high levels of refinement, the Eclipse GS-T is recommended 100%.
