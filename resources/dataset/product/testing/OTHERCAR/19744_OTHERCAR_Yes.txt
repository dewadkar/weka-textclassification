            This is my sixth van, all previously from another company.  This is the best of the lot.  Most comfortable ride -- no sway going around a curve.
Leaves other cars behind on a grade.  I also like the daylight riding lights and the side air bags, both of which saftey features I consider essential in todays freeway driving.
My only complaints would be the inclusion of clothes hangers from the roof at the middle seats, and a signal light when the cruise control is on.
I would also like to switch the radio controls on the steering wheel for cruise control buttons on the steering wheel. 
Other than that, I feel I can drive this van for years instead of trading it in every two years.<br><br>
