            The Fuji MX 2700 may very well be the last digital camera you will ever need to buy. At least for the time being.

The 2700 is one of the best overall digital cameras in the market today. It boasts all the features I was looking for in a digicam:  small size, long battery life, good image quality, extra features, and reasonable price.   In all, this camera was worth the purchase and I'd highly recommend it to any amateur or semi-professional photographer.

<b>the Good</b>
--Size and Design
The MX 2700 is currently considered the world�s smallest digital camera.  Period.  Don�t listen to what others might say.  
It measures in at 3.1� width, 4.0� height, 1.2� diameter.   The camera is slightly taller and thicker (4 times) than the Palm V.  It compares in size to the Canon A5/A50 Zoom/ S10/S20 models which are equally compact.  
I am able to fit the 2700 into my pocket with a bit of a bulge.  It fits easily into a jacket or front pocket.

--Looks.
Hands down, this is the best looking camera on the market.  It shoots in an upright manner, and is made of a sturdy aluminum material.  I�ve dropped the thing a couple times, and still no dent.  

--The LCD screen at 2� is big enough so you can clearly view objects you are shooting.  I wouldn�t recommend shooting at pictures through the small eyepiece/viewfinder.
 
 

--Features.
There are definitely no shortage of features on the 2700.   They may seem intimidating at first, but once you get used to digicam, it is fairly easy to use and operate.
Main features on the 2700 include:  self-timer, adjust image quality setting, adjust file size setting, adjust sharpness, auto-power off, adjust flash setting, macro setting for close ups, frame number count, focus, manual mode, normal mode, playback mode, PC mode. 

 You can set the camera in either the record mode or a regular point and click mode.  The record mode allows you to adjust the camera settings manually and preview them after you take the picture, while the regular mode allows you to simply point and shoot pictures at either the current default settings.


--Battery Life
I cannot stress how important a long lasting battery is on a digital camera.  Having to spend money on non-rechargeable batteries is not only a waste of money, but also a waste of your time.  Case and point is the Kodak DC 280 (and most Kodaks for that matter), which drains batteries quickly and empties your wallet dry.

The 2700 comes loaded with the NP-80 Lithium battery.   The battery handles a 16 MB SmartMedia and an 8 MB card with left over energy.  This amounts to a few hundred pics on basic mode, hundreds pics on normal mode, and around a hundred pics on fine
mode.  I�ve heard stories where the battery has lasted two 16 MB cards.

I did purchase an additional battery with my camera, but this was really unnecessary.  Unless you are traveling away from the country for a long time, do not get an extra one.  
Another reason for this is the 2700 comes loaded with an AC adapter (which is small enough to carry around in a pouch with the camera) that is universally accepted (with converters) throughout the world.  

--Image Quality 
The image quality and color balance on the 2700 is very good, but not great. There is a bit of yellowing on the pics.  
The close-ups are above average, not great.  Some pics come out fuzzy.

I�ve seen images on the Canon S10 and the Nikon Coolpix 950, which I consider comparable models (over 2.0 megapixel class) to the 2700; and they are better.
The reasons I did not choose these cameras was size and battery life.

I can tell you all about pic quality in words, but the fact of the matter is they are no subsitution for pictures/images.  So here's a link to over 20 
sample pictures:
www.dpreview.com/reviews/fujimx2700/default.asp?page=10

 ----
I usually set the camera on &quot;automatic mode&quot; and it takes pictures just fine. 
In &quot;record mode&quot; there are a whole slew of options that allow me to play around with the picture quality; for instance, there is a white balance option which allows you to adjust the setting according to condition � auto, sunny, cloudy, fluorescent 1 or 2, incandescent.  This feature really is useful; on occasion, I�ve used this function  in a dimmer light settings.


--Playback mode is useful.
Some of the functions include:  ability to touch up pictures on-screen as well as delete unwanted pictures.  
One of the big problems I had with the Canon A5 (an earlier version of the A50 Zoom) and Kodaks were the delete functions.

--Camera starts up fast.  
Within a couple seconds after turning on the camera, I can point, focus and shoot my picture.  The A5 lacked in this regard, as I had to wait a good 5-8 seconds for the camera to start up.

-- There is also hardly any lag time between picture shots.  The A5 is renowned for slow lag time in between shots.

--Video out allows you to check out your pics on a TV screen


<b>the Bad</b>

--No USB.
The upload time is ridiculously slow.  A 16 MB card may take up to 30 to 45 minutes, maybe longer.  I suggest either purchasing a media card reader where you can upload pictures quickly or uploading your pics frequently.


--The 2700 only has digital zoom (not optical). But, it works well.  It zooms at either 1.2X or 2.5X; the 1.2X zoom uses 42 mm lens; the 2.5 X uses 87 mm lens; no digital zoom is set at the default 35 mm lens.  The zoom simply crops out the picture; the lens does not pop out.

--Basic image quality setting is no good. 
Pictures taken at a distance at this setting, come out distorted, lacking much to be desired.  Another concern is that if you set the sharpness (on the setting control) on full level, the pictures come out way too sharp. 

--Eyepiece (viewfinder) could be bigger
The eyepiece seems to be unnecessary because the LCD viewer is so big and so clear.  


--Occasionally, I have to press halfway down on the shutter in order to get a proper focus.  Some pictures have come out bad when I simply point and click.  

--I�ve covered up the flash a couple times when I first started using the camera;  I�ve read similar reviewers mentioning this problem.  Do beware that this camera takes a bit of time getting used to.

--Not a professional camera.
Don�t opt for this camera if you are a professional.  Though there are many functions on this camera, there are digicams that boast even more functions, and offer better image quality.  
I�m confident, however that the 2700�s pic quality will be capable of providing excellent photo prints from websites like shutterfly.com

--Doesn�t come with a leather pouch.
I had read reviews where covers were included with the camera, but I believe this is only if you purchase the camera in foreign countries.


--Only 8 MB included
I recommend purchasing a 16 MB SmartMedia Card. 8 MB is not enough for the average user.
Here are the average settings on the number of images per card:  Fine mode (1800 X 1200 and 900 KB) = 8 ;  Normal Mode (1800 X1200 and 450 KB per shot) = 17; Basic (1800 X1200 and 230KB per shot) = 35; Fine mode (640 X 480 and 140KB per shot) = 47; Normal Mode (640 X 480 and 80 KB per shot) = 90; Basic Mode (640 X 480 and 40KB per shot) = 141.

These are approximations.  When you have a lot of dead space in your pictures (lots of white), you�ll be able to fit in more pictures, but only marginally.


<b>Where to Buy?</b>
I shopped around a bunch of places and found a deal for only 450 on-line through some small-time electronics shop in NYC.  Unfortunately, they were sold out.  I found that a bunch of on-line places were selling out of these cameras quickly.  This was a couple months ago. 

This time, I paid the extra price and opted to purchase from a reliable big-time e-tail: onvia.com  The total cost was about 560 but the camera arrived within days.

Currently, buy.com is offering this camera for only 487.00 and it is readily available.

<b>Should you buy?</b>
New digital camera megapixel technology seems to be changing at a faster rate than microprocessors with Moore�s Law.  
Instead of 18 months, it seems that new digital camera models are introduced to the market every 10 months.

Recently, the Fuji 4700z, the newer version of the 2700 (which only came out last June), was released to consumers. It boasts a whopping 4.3 megapixels; enough for megapixels to compete with professional cameras...maybe.  For more info on this check out this URL: www.dpreview.com/reviews/fuji4700z/   

 Nikon is offering a $100 rebate on purchases of its Coolpix 950 model (perhaps one of the best cameras on the market; it�s a hot selling device, as well) from April 1 until June or July.  Simply purchase the camera, head down to their website and sign up for the rebate offer.  

The reason for the drop in price? The eagerly anticipated Coolpix 990 is coming out! It should be hot:  www.dpreview.com/news/0004/00040502coolpix990inhouse.asp

Of course, it is probably  unnecessary for a recreational photographer to opt for one of these high-end megapixel cameras, at least until time and price work in our favor.

<b>the LowDown</b>
The Fuji MX 2700 is a small, sleek, convenient and elegant camera that is packed with loads of features.   It surely is a great toy and a great device.  I highly recommend it.
