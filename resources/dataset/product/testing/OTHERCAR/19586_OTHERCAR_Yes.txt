            I bought the Suburban because of the size and comfort of the vehicle. With bucket seats in the front the Suburban accomodates 8 people comfortably. This is very important when you have a big family. 

My family enjoys this vehicle more that our old custom van because inclement weather doesn't stop the trip. We pack all our gear for family outings and all 6 of us have great leg room. 

This is the 2nd Chevrolet SUV I have owned and the new models get much better gas mileage. On my last long trip i averaged 20 miles per gallon with a full car. With a 350 cubic inch engine the car also has great power. I recommend it to anyone who wants to travel in style and comfort<br><br>
