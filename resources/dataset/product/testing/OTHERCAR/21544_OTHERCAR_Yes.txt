            I bought my first digital camera in January 1997, is had it's own proprietary file format, was heavy and didn't take the best shots.  But hey, it was new and among the most advanced at the time.  Slowly it fell into disuse, it ate batteries and the hassle of converting the file format was a pain.

I bought a Sony digital cam corder that doubled as a camera.  Too big and clunky!

So... just as my wife and I were about to head out for Europe I took the plunge and bought the S200.

I am terrible with camera's, I usually leave them in the hotel room, on carry them with me but forget to use it.  My main gripe being size and staying power.  So, after hearing good things about the S200, we chose it because it was the smallest, cheapest 2 megapixel camera on the block.  It looks cool too which didn't hurt.

So, down to the features.  A camera buff we are not, so we just use the thing for point and shoot, and it works really well.

Most of the pictures came out very good, and those that didn't... well we simply deleted them.  Whilst in a dark church in Paris, I discovered that the Auto Flash just made for really dark pictures.  So I turned it off, and managed to get some really good shots that otherwise didn't come out.  Best of all, turning the flash off is pretty intuitive and I didn't have to refer to the manual.

Finding this out proved to be a real winner when we later visited the Louve as the camera flash just doesn't work well when taking big subjects in darker area's.

We also used the movie feature to take the short clips.  This works pretty well, but it automatically cuts off after 10 seconds.  This is all well and good, but it would be nice to be able to remove this restriction.  I must check the manual. :(

We are really happy with the camera, it's size makes it easy to take anywhere, it feels robust and can easily be used one handed, this trip we took something like 300 plus pictures! 

To avoid disappointment, buy a larger flash card and a spare battery when you get it.  I already knew to do this and also bought a case not much bigger than the camera with an extra pocket to stash the spare flash card and battery in.  The camera only gives you a warning that the battery is about to fail at the last gasp giving you only two or three more shots.  But if you have your spare battery ready, no problems.

I recommend the 64mb flash card, on medium mode it will give you 200 pictures, but then I always take my laptop traveling so can download the camera whenever I need and make more room.

Connecting to the pc is as simple as plugging in the USB port and switching on the camera in view mode.  The PC pics up the link and fires up the software (must be installed first of course) I did get a couple of errors on download, and the PC froze a couple of times.  From then on I simply used the windows explorer instead of the enclosed software.  No more problems, but this could just be my PC which is getting a little long in the tooth.

Gripes:

When using the camera on one hand, your thumb rests on the battery cover.  On a few occasions I went to press the shutter and the battery door slid open turning the camera off.

Startup is a little slow.  We took a few bus tours around the cities we visited and after being inactive the camera turns itself off to save the battery.  So along comes something you want to snap, you turn the camera on and by the time it's ready we were sometimes too late.  

Both of these complaints are more quicks than real issues and we got used to it.

One other note: Extra battery and bigger flash card required but bumps up the price.

Picture quality is excellent.  However my main use of the pictures is for internet use, e-mailing to friends and such, as well as storing on CD for later viewing.
