            I recently had an opportunity to test drive a 2002 Kia Spectra hatchback. This is one attractive car! 

The Exterior

The front end is nicely freshened from the 2001 model year and generally looks well constructed. The sporty fascia is certainly an impressive improvement over the plain Jane 2001 front fascia. The surprising thing to me about the car is that it's a hatchback! It does NOT look like a hatchback...but it is! So, you get all the benefits of a hatchback design, with none of the disadvantages (to some people)

The Interior.

While the interior is nice looking, if a bit generic, I was disappointed by the quality of the construction. The door plastics had burrs near the window, and the dashboard lower plastics did not properly meet the upper dash plastic, leaving a gap between the two. In addition, the door moulding seems excessively far away from the dashboard moulding when the door is shut. I looked at another Spectra to determine whether this was just an issue in the one car, but alas, I noted the same issues in the 2nd car I looked at.


Driving Impressions.

The first thing I noticed upon starting the car was the engine noise. Sound insulation between the engine and passenger compartment seemed to be inadequate. I attribute some of this excessive noise to two things
1) cold engine
2) new engine (28 miles) 

I expect that some of this startup noise will decrease after a thousand or so miles have broken the engine in some.

The car handled acceptably well for a car in this price range, BUT the ride seemed a tad jittery on rough pavement AND road noise was more than I would like to see. Acceleration was reasonable, and steering and braking responsiveness was just fine! The transmission shifted quite smoothly.

Overall it was a better than average driving experience for a car in this price range.
