            The oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera sedan is a decent car for the amount of money you will spend on it. They are inexpensive you can usually pick one up for under 2500 dollars depending on the year and condition of the Ciera. The Cutlass Ciera has ample trunk room and seats five people comfortably, which is pretty good for a mid-sized sedan. The Ciera lacks low end power but once you get it moving it has decent pick up when you push on the throttle. It's handling is smooth and reliable, and gives the driver a real sense of control. The Ciera isn't the most beautiful automobile to look at but it has a classic body shape and is dependable. I believe the Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera is a good first car to own for a teenager, its affordable and reliable.<br><br>
