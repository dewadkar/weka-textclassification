            This may just be the best vehicle I have ever owned. It takes a little bit of trial and error to get used to parking and turns but all in all its a pleasure to drive.  I own a 1991 Astro Conversion Van that I bought used when it was 1 year old. It now has 145,000 miles on it and has never let me down. I've only had to make normal wear and tear repairs and most of these were needed long after they normally would have worn out. I use this vehicle everyday to and from work and also make numerous trips during the year. It handles great on wet and icy road surfaces and the only time weather affects it much is during high winds when the raised roof does catch the wind a bit. I am currently looking for a newer model but I really don't want to get rid of this one since it's treated me so well.<br><br>
