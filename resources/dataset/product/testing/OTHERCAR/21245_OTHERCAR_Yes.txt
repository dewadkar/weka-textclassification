            The 2000 Toyota Camry XLE is the perfect midsize sedan. It has               every neccesity and more. The Toyota Camry has style, comfort,                                safety, reliability, and more. 

<b> The Interior/Ride/Safety: </b>

The interior is great, everything is appealing to the eye and easily accesable. The seats are very comfortable and the seat belts are comfortable also. There is an enourmous amount of trunk space that is very rare on other cars.The ride is dead quite and the handling on this car                                is incredible. There is enough room for two average-sized adults in the back. Safety was the Camry's designers top-priority. With added features like superior traction control, dual front airbags, re-inforced steel frame and much more. 

<b> The Engine/Specs: </b>

The engine is a 3.0 liter 24-valve V6(XLE model only)! The                                transmission is a 4-speed automatic. Driving this car becomes                                second nature. It has enough power to get you where you need to go. It is also extremely reliable. My Grandfather has a 1988 Toyota Camry that is in perfect condition. It has never needed replacements or repair jobs outside of regular maintenance. I am sure it will be the same for the new ones as well. 

<b> The Cliche: </b>

  The toyota Camry is a very versatile car. It is the                                perfect car for long term abuse by anything. It is great for kids,                                the backseat is very comfoprtable and big for carseats. It is a                                perfect family car but yet with its stylish exterior looks it can be                                used for a night on the town(just be sure to wash of all the                                stains on the seat:)). The Camry is a great sedan and I                                just cant say enough, so go test-drive it at your nearest Toyota                                dealer. The Camry Solora is also available, it has a more sportier look.                                With a base price for the Camry starting at $18,000 how could                                you go wrong.<br><br>
