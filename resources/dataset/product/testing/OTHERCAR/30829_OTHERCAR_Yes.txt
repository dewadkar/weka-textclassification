            I wanted an inexpensive but high quality resolution (1280x960) camera for personal use and detailed close-ups. This is a point and shoot (view finder) camera that takes wonderful clear detailed pictures at 1280, or 640 resolutions. It takes tif and jpg formats, the jpg format comes in high and low color compression settings. I researched &quot;via the internet&quot; for a month reading reviews and consumer reports before I decided to go with the digital D-340-R and I'm very happy with the purchase. The camera comes with Adobe Home edition Photo software and Enroutes stitching (Photo OCR) software. The stitching software allows pictures to be put together to create panoramas. This Olympus was the only high resolution (1280x960) 1.3-mega pixel camera I could find for under $300.00. And worth every penny of it. My system has a scanner, printer, and CD Writer and I had no problem at all loading the device (Camera) to my computers Com port. I did have to move my mouse to the PSI port to free up the serial port. But everything loaded and operated clean on the first shot... Surprise!
Not everything is perfect though, I found the manual to be cumbersome and tough to understand for a first time digital user (as I) and it takes some study to remember what buttons to push to make the camera do any of its many capabilities.

SUMMARY: If you want a point and shoot for family, pet and travel pictures... this is a high quality great inexpensive camera.<br><br>
