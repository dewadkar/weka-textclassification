            I have followed this PT Cruiser since it was just a sketch on paper and my interest has grown day by day.  The fact that I am not a person to be fascinated by a vehicle seems strange since I have completely fallen for the PT Cruiser.  

I love every little detail about this vehicle from the front bumper to the back bumper.  Getting in and out of the front or the back seat is so easy.  The seats are very comfortable.  The seat belts can even be adjusted so that the belt doesn't rub your neck.  

Driving the PT Cruiser is a dream.  I am impressed with power of the small engine.  The small body will slip right into a parking place - no more backing up and pulling up to get straight in the parking space.  Visibility is very good.  Driving long distances doesn't even make me tired.  Having a car that takes corners so easily is great.

Everyone deserves to own such a wonderful ride.  On a scale of 1-5, I would rate this car as a 10.  If you don't want a vehicle that everyone will look at, you better not buy the PT Cruiser.
