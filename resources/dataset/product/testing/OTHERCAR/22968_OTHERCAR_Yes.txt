            When I bought this digital camera I wasn't really even looking for one but saw the price and couldn't pass up the opportunity.  I was still very new to what all a home computer could do, let alone a digital camera.

This camera has not only been fun to play around with, but it is also an invaluable tool.  

The fun part of it is that you can take goofy pictures, up to 96, and not worrying about wasting film.  After taking a few pictures it is great to be able to go back and delete the ones that you either don't like or didn't turn out right i.e.: someone blinked, head was turned, etc.

The invaluable tool part is that my wife uses it for school to take pictures of her students working, their art work and various other aspects of her job.  She can then delete the ones that she wants, save them into the computer, or even print them out.

The camera gives you the capability of taking very high quality pictures, up to 12, or low quality, up to 96!!  This is a great feature, because it allows you to easily switch the quality you want a picture to end up like with the simple push of a button.

There is only one flaw that I have found with the camera, but it is really only a patience thing.  I have found that on start up this camera is very slow.  Sometimes it seems like it takes almost a full minute for it to come on.  I find this to be too much time in most cases, because you know how kids and pets move.  By the time the camera comes on you have missed the picture.  

All in all, this is a great camera for beginners, as long as you have a little patience and some time to get used to the features.<br><br>
