            Ok, I admit it, this is a great camera in many ways, but, hey, do you HAVE to be a Ph D. to learn how to use these things, or what?  With 3.34MP, you get great detail, but I've found the learning curve to be, well, shall I say &quot;a little steep&quot;?

Aside from that, though, what knock-out prints I can make!!!  WOW!  Great color tones, sharp sharp sharp 8x10's, and it saves my bacon when I shoot wide and need to crop and enlarge!

Olypus clearly thought out placement of controls and what this unit lacks in terms of ease of learning curve, it makes up for in EVERYTHING else.

Automatic bracketing...great!  No more leaving important shots to chance with one over and one under the &quot;normal&quot; exposure.  (Again...saving my bacon!)

I also like the unit's auto AND manual focus, selectable shutter speeds, slow flash sync, and multi-patterned white balance feature.  

Shadow detail in px is great and the 3x OPTICAL zoom is a nice lens range.  By the way, the 3030 cycles FAST, fast, fast...and burst shots prove it.  As for color....vibrant is the only word to describe it.

Great camera...but brace yourself to spend a little time with the manual!

If you want most of the features and a better price, check my review of the Olympus 3000 model --- which is exactly the same except...well, see &quot;SAVING AND ENJOYING!&quot; at the Olympus 3000 review section.<br><br>
