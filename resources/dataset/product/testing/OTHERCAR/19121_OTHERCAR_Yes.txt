            We purchased the 1999 Volkswagen Passat (Buttercup) new in November of 1998.  We are trading the car on a new Eurovan and are terribly sad to loose this car.  At the time we were shopping for this car, we were considering the Maxima, Mazda 626 and the Accord.  Once we drove the Passat the decision was clear.  We first drove the turbo 4 version, which was a fine car, but then we made the "mistake" of driving the V6 with manual transmission.  This car is dangerously fun to drive.  The low rpm torque is strong enough for strong power from a stand still, but the real joy comes when you reach the power band at 3200 rpm.  It almost feels like a turbo when you reach this region.  I haven�t seen a power chart on this engine, but the engine is extremely strong from 3200 rpm upwards, unlike many engines that must race up to high rpm�s in order to produce peak power.  Top speed on the car is supposedly 141mph.  I have not tested this, although I have no doubts about its accuracy.  At highway cruising speeds, the engine has enough power in 5th gear that it is not necessary to down shift when passing aggressively.  The clutch and the gearbox are very smooth and fun to drive.

Handling is very good.  I have heard of people upgrading the suspension on this car with remarkable results, but the stock components are more than adequate.  Driving in the curves and mountains is a lot of fun, and at high speeds the car feels very secure.  In fact, the car actually feels more stable at 80 than at 60 mph.  The brakes are very good as well.  Emergency stops can be achieved without standing everyone�s hair on end.  The car is extremely quite on the road and is very comfortable on a long trip.  The trunk is huge and easy to load.  Over all, the car feels much more like a European luxury sedan (BMW, Mercedes, etc.) than its competitors.  The car is built very solidly and it has a quality feel.

Negatives; well there are not many.  The cup holders are kind of silly.  Apparently Germans don�t drink while they drive.  The owners manual doesn�t really fit well any where.  If it is in the glove box, there isn�t room for much else.  There were a few minor problems, which were all covered under warrantee.  The wood trim developed some small cracks, and one of the door seals became loose.  Both of these were fixed in the first few months and were covered under warrantee.  We wish we had gotten the leather interior, as dog hair really sticks to the cloth and alloy wheels would look nice.  Also, the rubber-feel handles are nice, but they are beginning to rub off of the handles.  This is the only significant design flaw.  The reclining mechanism on the seats is a pain, because you have to rotate a knob MANY times to completely recline the seat.

Other cool things:  air conditioned glove box; retractable rear window shade; nice wood trim and shift knob; center-cut key, general luxuriousness.

Final comments:  This is a really nice car that has a good balance of power, utility, luxury, fun and affordability.  If educators were paid more money, we would keep this car forever and buy the Eurovan as an additional car.  We are very sad to let Buttercup go and hope she finds a good home.
