            I purchased the Olympus D360L after comparison shopping.  I wanted a digital camera to bring along on a two-week trip to California so that I could post photos on my website.  I knew that I wanted a camera that was small, that had an LCD window, and which had SmartCard Media storage.  The D360L fit the bill and was inexpensively priced to boot!  In comparison to other manufacturer's models, the Olympus was about $50 less and had greater storage capacity (8 MB vs 4MB).  

I have found that it is very easy to use and takes very clear, crisp pictures.  I love having the LCD window as it allows you to view the shot immediately after taking it so that you can decide if it is worth saving or if you have to re-take it (how many times have you had pictures come back with closed eyes, no smiles, etc?).  It holds up to 36 high-quality pictures before having to download, which makes it very convenient.  I purchased an additional 32 MB card and have not had to use it once.

The software included with the camera is good for very basic photo editing.  If you want to do more advanced editing, you would probably want to obtain a higher-end photo editor.

Keep an extra set of AA batteries handy, especially is using the LCD a lot.  Mine lasted for about 125 pictures.
