            If you are interested in learning about digital cameras but don't want to waste $1000 on an electronic Chia Pet, the Olympus D-450 Zoom is the digital camera you need. The D-450 has the ease of point and shoot cameras with the high resolution of more expensive digital cameras costing hundreds more. The images are truly outstanding. The display screen on back shows you instantly whether or not you got the shot you wanted. As with all digital cameras, the images can be downloaded onto your computer for viewing or printed out on any photo-ready printer. The D-450 comes with software to help with your needs.
And now the bad news. This camera eats batteries. The expected alkaline battery life is approximately one hour. This will depend on how many downloads and use of the viewing screen. The D-450 has many accessories that help minimize this problem. Rechargeable batteries, AC adapter and floppy adapter are all suggested, and worth the extra money. Since the D-450 is now considered &quot;older&quot; technology, the price has been dropping slowly. Retail stores have them for around $500 and internet stores sell these for $385 - $450.<br><br>
