            We bought our suburban for several reasons:

1. We have four kids, three still at home, so there are plenty of occasions when we need to have a large vehicle.

2. We take driving vacations from time to time, and like to be comfortable as we travel.

3. We live in an area where there is snow in winter, and we wanted a safe vehicle with 4 wheel drive.

4. We liked the style and appearance of the suburban.

Our suburban has delivered on all counts.  Room, comfort, traction, reliability, etc.  But...

The thing that I am most pleased about now is safety.  Not long ago, we were in heavy traffic on an interstate highway.  For some reason, traffic in front of us came to a complete stop.  I slammed on my brakes and got stopped quickly, no problem.  The guy behind me was looking at the beautiful scenery instead of traffic...didn't even see us.  Hit us from behind at highway speed.  He was in a full size pickup truck.

My wife and I were in the front seats.  Three kids in the back.

The high back suburban seats protected our necks.  We were hit hard, very hard, but there was no structural damage to our suburban.  Required a lot of repair in the back, but only to one door and one side.  Conversely, the truck that hit us was a mess...front bumper pushed to the firewall.

None of us were hurt!  Mostly, I think that was a blessing...but I sure am glad we were in our suburban.

P.S. A while later: Just had a spring snow...and the suburban was great.  Reminded me of why we love it.<br><br>
