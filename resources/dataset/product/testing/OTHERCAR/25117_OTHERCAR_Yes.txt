            It took a long time to replace my wife's Intrepid, which had a great rear seat. But the Intrepid was falling apart, so we went off looking at nice cars with enough rear seat room for two car seats and an adult in the BACK. As her father lives with us, this was important. Not many cars can do this. We came down to a Continental (no rear headroom, $$), a Volvo S80 (rear shoulder room tight) and the E-class sedan. But we didn't like the odd shaped trunk (it's more of a left-to-right space rather then a front-to-back space). Half kidding I asked if she liked the wagon and the answer was curiously "yes". Back to the dealer - get me the silver one.

We passed on the leather seating option as this was the lollipop, I mean "family" car, and the leather looked fake and the vinyl looked like leather (!). Heated seats a must, although I like the option of constant ON like in the Audi. Upgraded stereo is the biggest disappointment, the CD player is nice and in the rear well.

I really wanted a 4wd car, and the E-class is a beauty. And we can always flip up the rear seats (3rd row) for more seating, which comes in handy. The rear area has a retractable cover, but it doesn't work if you put the child seat tether over the rear seat (you can go around and between). This car has a nice 320 engine in it, gets a consistent 20 mpg, and does get out of it's owm way rather nicely. It has an "autostick" tranny but the novelty is wearing off. 

Quirks: seat position can be made without the key only with the door open
or the key on. Headlamp switch puts parking lights on too easily if shut off too firmly. Central locking switch seems backwards. Door pockets a little tight. 

Nice things: paint job, sunroof, auto-closing hatch (wish the doors had this rather than slamming them and waking the kids), air conditioning features including REST (residual heat while engine is off) and carbon air filter), oh, and auto sensing wipers are very cool. GPS/SOS feature is very very interesting.

Overall, it's not cheap, but it's a LOT of car. Wide enough in the rear for the kids and Grandpa, fast enough and 4wd for Dad. 

Hauls a lot of stuff, makes hardware store and Price Club runs a breeze.

We has a small problem with the blinker, fixed under warranty with pickup and delivery service by dealer.
