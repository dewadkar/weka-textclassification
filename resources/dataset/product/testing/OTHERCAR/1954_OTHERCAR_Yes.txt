            I bought the 2000 Nissan Maxima in August of 2000. It's a good time to buy a car since dealers are trying to clear inventory. I purchased a dark green with light beige interior GLE, which includes leather, fake wood trim, sun roof, spoiler, Bose stereo, and 6+1 cd system (I think this wasn't an option). I like the interior leg room of the car, there seems to be lot in the back especially. For short trips, you could consider this a 5 person car. However, in the center of the back seat there is a small hump which would probably be uncomfortable for long trips.This also comes with power everything including seats and heated seats too. This was a big step up for me in cars since I previously owned a Chevy Cavalier, so I may be easily impressed. However, another new purchase I made for my wife was a VW Passat and I like the Maxima better. The engine is quite powerful and has great acceleration. The only downside is that it is recommended you use 91 octane gas to get the full performance. However, at the gas stations I go to there is only 87, 89, or 93. Opting for the 93 is quite expensive so I usually get 89. I haven't seen a difference in normal driving. The trunk is a good size, so no comlpaints there. This model also includes an automatic heating/cooling system that will adjust the fan speed and temperature accordingly until it reaches the desired internal temperature. I have one complaint with the car, which is really small and just annoying, with the temperature control. I normally like to re-circulate the air instead of intaking air from the outside. That way air is usually cooler or hotter and there is less pollution. However, everytime you turn the car off it seems to default back to the intaking external air when you have the AUTO mode selected. It's just annoying. The sounds system is pretty good though not super phenomenal. I thought it might be a little better with the Bose name. I've had the car for about 11 months now and have 11,000 miles on it and I haven't had any problems. I haven't needed to take it back to the dealer once yet. This is kind of surprising considering all power features included. I would highly recommend this car. Picking one up used that had low mileage would be a good idea. Especially, since mine seems to be running like new after almost a year.
