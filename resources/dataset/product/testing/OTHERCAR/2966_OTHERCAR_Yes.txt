            I love my Lincoln Navigator.  It rides and handles like a luxury car, but I have the added safety of its size.  The safety aspect was a major factor of our purchase of this vehicle.  We have two children, and I feel very secure whenever we travel, even to the grocery store.  The Navigator is also a very comfortable vehicle to ride in.  We have the optional third row seat, which is great for car pooling.  We had an Expedition before we purchased the Navigator, and the Navigator rides so much smoother than the Expedition.  It rides more like a car, whereas the Expedition had more of a truck feel.  I also hate my Navigator!  Our Navigator has been in the shop more times than it should of been.  I also think part of this problem was our dealer.  If they would of fixed the problems correctly the first time, I wouldn't of had to make repeat visits.  The major problem we had was that our &quot;check suspension&quot; light would come on.  The dealer did not want to replace this part right away (over $1,000), so they had me make several return visits.  I would recommend this vehicle to anyone who can afford it.  It is well worth the additional monies for safety and style.<br><br>
