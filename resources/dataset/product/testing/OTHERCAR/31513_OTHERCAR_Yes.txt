            The interior styling is a cut above the other cars in it's class. The two-tone design really makes it feel upscale, and the controls are all accessible and intuitive.

Steering is extremely light and smooth. I had a rental for a week and when I got my car back I couldn't believe the difference.

Gas pedal is also light - not a good thing. You can't rest your foot on it, so it gets tired quick. I have cruise control so it's not a big deal.

Sound system is not very impressive.

Long, low nose that bumps abrupt sidewalks and parking blocks.

The car has started to make some rattles in the cockpit area. Not all the time but its getting more frequent.

Bright headlights. I get flashed constantly by drivers who think I have my brights on. Whether this is a good or a bad feature is up to you.

Comfortable seats, but not enough support for long trips.

excellent cup holders, front and back.

Very convenient, very nice looking compartment on the dashboard. Most cars just waste this space.

Fuel gauge works even when the car is off.

Excellent gas mileage. I get 30-35 depending on temp and setting.

Awesome acceleration through the lower gears. 0-60 in 8.5 seconds. 0-40 in about 3.5; great for pulling into tight traffic.

This is very cool: The AC basically doesn't <i>touch</i> the gas mileage. I was used to paying for my AC by the mile, but I literally can't tell a difference in fuel consumption with this car. Very nice peace of mind for the frugally-minded in the summer.
