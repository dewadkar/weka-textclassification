            It is totally a new look!! It looks like something from outer space. The car is sooo fast that only the first inch of the speedometer is legal speed, if the needle is straight up, you r doing 100. On the way home from the dealer I saw every man on the road staring at me and trying to see who was driving it.  I just bought it today so I can't tell you that much about if yet. The price was right too. They are not nearly as expensive as they used to be, go for it!!!  You can feel the quality.Our family has owned 7 Toyota's of all kinds and we are always happy with the car. We have never had any major problems with a Toyota. They are definitely built to last and designed well. <br><br>
