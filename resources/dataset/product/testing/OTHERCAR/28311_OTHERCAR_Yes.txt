            Around for Christmas 2002 my friend got the Powershot S200 because he always borrowed his parents Sony digital camera.  Within 4 months two of my other friends had gotten the S200 because of it's great size, ease of use and clear, beautiful pictures.  After graduating one of my friends and I were both very familiar with our friends cameras (the S200) and we came to love it.  We would go all over, New York, Princeton, and take tons (and yes I mean tons) of pictures of everything!  All Digital Elph cameras come with cables to connect the camera to a TV so we would have "slide-show" parties to show all of our friends where we have been  and all the good times.

Why am  I writing all of this?  The point is this...whether you're buying this camera for your kid, or your using it for professional looking pictures you can't find a better camera for the job.  During our pre-prom photo shoot one of the moms, technologically inclined, was using the S230 with ease and the pictures that resulted were amazing.

So needless to say, when I choose a camera I went with the S230 because it had all of the reliable features and perfect size of the S200, and its picture and movie clip quality are even better!  Of course now my friends are jealous that when I zoom in on someone, the clarity is so  much better than their 2.0 mega pixels.

Also if you're looking into whether or not you should spend the extra money to get the Powershot S400 think of this:

Between the S200 (2 mega pixels)  and S230 (3.2 mp) there is a 1.2 mega pixel difference.  But between the S230 and S400 (4mp) there is only a .8mp difference and once you start going over 3mp you won't see the change in picture quality unless you are printing out pictures greater than 8*10 (which is highly unlikely)!

Also with this camera I suggest getting at least a 256MB Sandisk Memory Card, that way you can take lots of pictures (like 170 on the extremely high quality setting, or 250 on the factory preset setting).  

With the picture quality there are two adjustments:

1)The resolution. L (large) is 2048*1536, M1 1600*1200, M2 1024*768, and S 640*480.  

2)The compression. Here there are three settings. With the resolution on L the 3 different compression settings allow for 154, 276, 548 pictures (using a 256MB Compactflash card).

Finally, one last suggestion is to look into the brand new 3.2 Digital Elph Canon made, the SD100.  It's smaller and lighter than the S230 but since it just came out (today was the first time I saw it on-line) I'm guessing it is really expensive still.
