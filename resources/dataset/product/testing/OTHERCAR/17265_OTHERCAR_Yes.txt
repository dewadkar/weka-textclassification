            I thought it was time to buy my Intrepid when the kids were squashed in the back of my Mercury Tracer,so I went to the dodge dealer and there it was the car of my dreams sporty but yet still family.I love the way it drives the room I have and no more kids screaming that they have no more room to sit in the back.The trunk space my god I could fit a load of luggage and still be able to squeeze in more.It gives a good ride and when the husband isn't around well guys look .It is a sharp looking car and I would tell people who are looking for roomy but still sporty that this would be a car for you.  If you are in the neighborhood of a dodge dealer just stop in and look at one or test drive it and maybe I'll just make a believer out you.<br><br>
