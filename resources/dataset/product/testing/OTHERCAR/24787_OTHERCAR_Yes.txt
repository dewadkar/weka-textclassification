            I bought my 1991 Toyota Corolla Lx used from a Honda dealer that sold used cars and in the seven years I have owned this car, I have never experienced any mechanical problems, except it was the day before I traded it in for another car this past July because the exhaust pipe was blowing smoke whenever I drove at a certain speed.  It occurred while I was driving on an upgrade or going sixty miles an hour on the freeway. 

I bought this car when it was 47,000 miles and by the time I traded it in, it had 154,000 miles on it.  But I think I got my money's worth from driving this car for several years.

I have taken this car on various trips to Nevada and it was very dependable.  The acceleration was somewhat slow, but it sure got me where I wanted to go.  What I liked about this car too, was the gas milege.  It was automatic transmission, but it sure got some real great gas milege.  

Only three years ago, I was starting to take this car to the repair shop after having it diagnosed by Auto Club.  There were numerous things that needed to be replaced or fixed.  Despite of this, the car was still dependable, but with old age, you will sure expect some problems to occur.  And I had to keep on taking this car back in for repairs because within a month after replacing my radiator hose, I had to take the car back in to have it replaced again because of some defect that caused radiator fluid to leak out of my new hose.  Then, the day after Christmas in 1999, the motor indicator light came on and I had to have it shut off, but it would come back on and then, the problem  was finally found; it was a defected part that was connected, which I haven't a clue, but it was replaced and the light never came back on again.  

Toyota Corollas are known for it's very good reliability and is the most popular car to be on the roads these days.  They were first built in 1968, but the only versions that were out were the two-door coupe and two-door hatchback.  They have earned it's good reputation for being the most outstanding car in the Toyota line.  The 1991 Toyotas were going strong and to this day, they still are, even though, they are over ten years old now.  The reason I traded mine in is because I did not want to put anymore money out for repairs which I have been doing for the last three years now.

The Corollas will always be around for many more years.
