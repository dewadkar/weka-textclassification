            I leased a 2000 9-3SE and loved it every minute that I had the car.
Saab is obsessive about design and makes a car that you could drive full speed into a brick wall and walk away from the accident. They are better in real world crashes than any other car out there.
I am both an artistic minded person, but also of the engineering bent - so the Saab appealed to both of those aspects.

The look of the car on the outside is based on your own opinion - or rather what you think of it is a matter of person preference - the shape is actually very close to the ideal shape for optimal aerodynamics (and safety - ideal aerodynamics would be a wing, but that shape in a car would cause it to flip).

The interior of the 2000 9-3SE was fantastic. I also drove an '01 and it was quite nice as well. I drove an -'02 and it was awful - truly a bad year for the 9-3 (in terms of interior - the engine itself seemed fine).
The leather stayed in fantastic condition and the seats were incredibly comfortable (except for the center seat in the back - due to the folding seat design, the center seat in the back was terribly uncomfortable to sit in for anything more than a short ride).
The steering wheel fit perfectly for me and the controls on it were exactly where I would have intuitively thought they should be.
The driver's side of the car is designed so that everything you need is in easy and close reach and in sight.

I like that the key is down low - many people find that as a flaw and are really bothered by it - I much preferred it there for many reasons. Among them being that there is less stress on the key, it is a natural place to put your hand as you are getting in, the keys don't jangle as you drive, and you don't hit your knee on them if you are tall (I'm 6'3" - and incidentally the car is a very nice fit for myself, as well as my father who is 6'6" - he owns a '99 9-5, but was impressed with the power of the 9-3 SE).

The stereo in it was fantastic, the amount of cargo you can carry is huge (but apparently not quite as much as the older 900 designs since the rear seats don't go 100% flat when you put them down).
I moved many items in my car - just be careful of corners hitting the front seats and cutting the leather.

I had the automatic transmission. Some people prefer standard, and I might be one of those people... I wouldn't know since I have never learned standard. As a result, I just got the auto. It has a Winter mode in which it starts in a higher gear (3rd I think) and revs the engine higher for when you are starting from a stand still on ice.
There is also a Sport mode which holds it in gear slightly longer before shifting. 
The overall drive is quite snappy and very responsive - I have driven many automatic transmissions that felt sloppy and awful - I could see why people hate them. This is far from that.

The car had a great engine that put out a ton of torque considering it was just a turbocharged 2.0 L.
People complain of torque steer, but I never really experienced a problem with it - perhaps it is different in a standard transmission car.

I had a flat in the car, a broken strut, a melted coolant hose, and a series of absolutely horrible dealer experiences. None of which I blame on Saab (well, I guess technically the coolant hose may have been a Saab issue).
The flat was due to awful Boston roads, as was the broken strut - the fact that the mechanics never noticed it until it got bad was a concern.
Also the fact that they completely screwed up multiple attempts to fix the coolant hose issue was worrisome (never EVER buy a car or get service from 128 Saab - they are completely useless - Charles River Saab is far more competent).

If I had any complaints about the Saab, it would have to be only that I don't particularly like the direction that GM is taking them (GM bought them out and obviously wants to make money, so they are doing some non-Saab-like things with the newer models - seems like '02 and on start showing more and more signs of GM). 
Another issue would be that the front windshield, while at an angle to maximize your visibility, also gets a lot of wind noise when you are going closer to 80mph.
Along with that, the odd angle of the window makes it hard for your ValentineOne radar detector to stay mounted on there :)

Then finally, the stock tires that came on my Saab were fairly noisy in the summer and relatively scary in the winter. I switched to some higher performance "all weather" tires - once you go high performance in an "all weather" tire, what they really mean is "all weather, as long as it is a warm and dry summer day".
I had a really scary time in the winter with the new set of tires - several near wrecks.

If you get the car, shell out the money and get some nice warm weather tires that are rated to drive well and be quiet - they are well worth it. Then if you are in an area that gets any snow at all (or ice), then spend the money on just normal snow tires (there is no need for performance when you can't go fast).
The Saab with proper snow tires drives better than any 4-wheel drive car that doesn't have snow tires on it (as a friend in his Audi S4 quickly found out when he drove into a lamp post while bragging how great his Quattro was... but on stock performance tires).

All in all, a fantastic car and if I live in the States again, I will own a 2000 or 2001 9-3 SE again for certain. 
My fiancee loves them too.


(this review is for the hatchback - the convertible version is far more expensive and doesn't have any room for storage beyond a bag or two of golf clubs - the convertible is also, as are most convertibles, less stiff in the curves when driving. the best thing going for the convertible is that it can easily/comfortably seat 4 and it still is sporty)
