            I bought this at Staples for $199 dollars about a week before I went away for 3 weeks. My idea was that a digital camera would be cool because I am horrible using disposable cameras, my pictures are usually either very dark, completely white, or completely black. My pictures with this camera were fine. No complaints. It doesn't take pictures that look like a $500 dollar camera but it doesn't cost even half that much. I liked looking at the pictures on the LCD screen right after I took them so I'd no whether everyone had there eyes open, no one had an unbuttoned button (Seinfeld reference), etc. I quickly learned that batteries were not invincible to this camera and died quickly. Some hints about this; don't use the LCD screen to "viewfind", and regular Duracell batteries last longer for me than the Titanium batteries that come with it. Don't even think of using those cheap batteries as the 4 of the will only last about 4 or 5 pictures.
I recommend buying a larger film cartridge when you buy this camera because the 4MB only holds about 10 or 11 high quality pictures. This camera uses the CompactFlash format.
The software that comes with this is good for looking at the pictures but I haven't tried using it to edit them.
Some things that annoy me about the camera are:
To take a picture you have to hold down the button halfway for about 2 seconds until the green light goes on then you push the button down all the way to take the picture.
There is nothing that covers the lens so I bought a carrying case because I was always scared it might get scratched.
As soon as I got home from vacation the price for this camera went down to $150. The price will probably continue to go down right after you buy it also because the technology is still developing.
Besides the low battery lives, there is nothing else really wrong with this camera.
