            A year ago I had the unfortunate experience of needing to purchase a car rather quickly.  It seems my mother's Ford Taurus rejected the transmission transplant we had given it, and I needed to get to work.  After looking at several cars, mostly new (Jetta, Passat, Saturn, used Camry), i settled on a fully pimped out 2001 SL2, complete with a good sound system and sunroof (hell yeah!).

Over all the car is fine.  I'll start with the Pros and move to the cons.

PROS:
The stereo is exceptional, especially for a factory install.
Fuel Economy (manual, 4 cylinder) is slightly over 30MPG.
The car has OOMPH.  It won't toss you in the back seat, but I've never once thought, "boy, I wish this could accelerate faster". 

CONS:
The seats are very low.  Even my shorter friends comment how far they have to sit down.  And getting out of the car is sometimes an amazing chore.
Also, the passenger seat squeeks. When someone is sitting there, it just goes 'eek eek eek' and drives you batty.

Changing gears takes a lot of getting used to.  The car will jerk if you don't shift at PRECISELY the correct time.  And I mean on the dot. +/-10 RPM and it's seamless, anything more and the car is liable to lurch.

One other oddity is the gas tank.  When I have between 1/3 and 2/3 of a tank of gas, it has a tendency to slosh.  By virtue of the shape of the tank, when i come to a stop, it will often make a decided 'THUMP' noise.  It's very odd, and they can't fix it.

The brakes seem a bit underpowered.  They are fine in general, but when it comes to emergency stopping you better be able to swerve as well.  Which brings into play my final complaint.

The final, and probably my most major complaint, is the way the car handles on curves.  If you take a curve slightly fast, you can just feeeeel the back end waiting to slide away.  Believe me, I spun out on an off ramp and I was going only 5 over the limit.  I am hopeful that new tires will grip better, but it bothers me that I have had to consciously alter my driving habits so as not to wreck my car.
