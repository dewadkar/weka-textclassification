            I recently test drove the 2002 Infiniti G20 and was not impressed. The mediocre luxury of the 2001 was barely upgraded for the 2002 model. This car is a joke when placed in the luxury car category. 

I knew walking in that the G20 was the bottom of the Infiniti line, a compact car, and not the strongest runner in the pack, but the extent of its lack of finesse and style surprised me. 

The DOHC engine delivers a mild 145 horsepower, which never really gets the car going despite its miniscule size. The shifting is relatively smooth but never really gives much power. The car is a V4 and often engines of that size cannot deliver but I was hoping the G20&#146s size and Infiniti&#146s ability to upgrade would overcome this. Unfortunately I was let down. One upgrade this year is the fuel economy. The EPA estimates are up one overall mile to 24-mpg in the city and 31-mpg highway for the 4-speed automatic. 

The advanced independent multi-link front suspension and the rigid body contributed toward good handling and allowed for a smooth ride and firm braking power. The car is small and turns well and has little roll in hard turns. This is mostly to be expected of a tiny "sports" car from Infiniti and does not exemplify this car in any way. 

The road ahead isn't always predictable as it wasn&#146t in my test drive. To handle less-than-favorable conditions, the G20 is equipped with viscous limited-slip differential. I actually experienced this system since my test drive was in the rain. I did not experience slipping of any kind and I did feel in control the whole time. But as I have said previously, this is to be expected on a car like this and does not place it above the pack in any way. 

The shape of the body is a deterrent for some and a beauty to others. Personally the body shape is not one the G20&#146s fine points for me. I understand that compact cars need to be oddly shaped to expand the cabin but I feel Infiniti could have done a better a job with the rake and profile of the car. 

I am just over six feet tall and the inside is cramped for me both front and back. Even my children have a tough time in the back with its minimal legroom. 

The stylish halogen headlights, with jewel-type lenses, are auto controlled so they turn themselves off if you forget. I have yet to see Infiniti include a rain sensor for the lights on this car. It seems to me that a feature like this would be easy and cheap to install and manufacture. It is a useful feature and I wonder why Infiniti has not yet included it. 

The car I tested had the sports package, which included the 16&#148 aluminum-alloy wheels. The large openings in the multi-spoke caps channel cooling air over the brakes to help reduce fade and also add a touch of elegance to the outside of the car where it is badly needed. This package though, is just throwing away money. Nothing can be thrown at this car to relieve it of its mediocrity. 

Once inside you take in the ergonomic interior that you can furnish with an array of elegant options. As usual with Infiniti, elegance is present, but there is still none of the high-end features you would expect from a car in the "luxury" category. The perforated leather-appointed interior, heated power front seats and an automatic temperature control system are all nice, but they are also all becoming standards on cars that do not claim to be luxury. The auto temperature control worked well and kept the car at a pleasant temperature throughout the ride. The leather was not up to par though. It was not as soft as those of higher end cars. It also did not seem to breathe well and would most certainly be uncomfortable in the extreme temperatures of the summer and winter. 

The G20 has an 8-way power adjustable driver's seat, 4-way adjustable front passenger's seat, 2-way adjustable front and rear-seat head restraints, and five passenger seating capacity. One would have trouble fitting five adults in the car. The rear seat is too small to have three adults back there although the front is reasonably comfortable given the available space with the seats back. 

Every G20 is outfitted with a 6-speaker Bose audio system (with in-dash CD and cassette player). The lack of a woofer does show itself in the lack of strength in the car audio. The speakers are well placed though and mostly make up for the loss of the woofer. 


The center console has an integrated armrest and a large storage area capable of holding a number of CDs. The fold-down rear center armrest also has integrated dual cup holders. 

The safety of the car is improved over previous models but still has serious problems. The front and side airbags come out of the seats which means that they will always be in the right place no matter the seat position, but that also means that if the airbags deploy accidentally, the replacement will cost a lot. There are crumple zones front and rear, an energy-absorbing steering column, and high strength steel in the pillars and roof. 

The Infiniti Anti-lock Braking System applies and releases brakes up to 20 times per second, helping you maintain direct control while braking and turning, especially on slippery surfaces. Although the road was not the greatest where I test drove, there was no point at which I had the chance to test this system. Since most cars today have ABS, and it has been around for a while, I would think that Infiniti has a system that works well when necessary. 

Most of the features in this car that are supposed to make it a luxury car are just imitations. Most of the features are found on cars that do not claim to be luxury. Infiniti should consider either the removal of this car from their line or upgrading it to increase the average of their line to where it should be.
