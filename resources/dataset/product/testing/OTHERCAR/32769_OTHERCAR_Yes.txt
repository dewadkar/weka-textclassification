-Build and Body Integrity-
The s400 Elph is built with sophistication and style.  I was quite impressed with the feel and weight while taking pictures.  The body, made of a metal composite withstands small knocks and would definitely serve well in travel conditions.  A small gripe is the LCD screen not having a protective plastic or polycarbonate over on the back of the camera, this would make the s400 even more durable and would extend the life of this camera much longer.  A camera which has perfected the LCD protection schema is the G3/G5.  These cameras allow the user to flip the screen and turn the screen inside while being carried, stowed, or pocketed.  The telescoping lens protection is also an issue with robust protection.  However, I haven't had too much of a problem with the lens cover.  I have had to blow dust out a few times after being pocketed through weekend trips.  Nothing a camera case can't prevent.  I am however very impressed with its size and find it quite small for the punch it delivers.

-Controls-
I've owned this camera for over 3 months now and am literally still trying to use all its features.  I've found that the zoom control can be a bit discrete especially when looking at pictures on the camera.  It could be a little more user friendly rather than using the camera's normal zoom swivel button.  Power button is great, I haven't turned on the camera accidentally yet- a feature that definitely is good when traveling or when using the camera frequently.  Only after pushing the power button on for more than 2 seconds will the camera come to life.  I've also had a bit of a problem with the function and display buttons under the LCD screen, this buttons probably should be more user friendly because of the fact that these controls are sometimes used interchangeably from shot to shot.  Although one might argue that these features aren't that important, someone with a smaller memory card (32mb is given to you by canon) or someone that is very demanding of their battery might have a lot of use for these functions.  I don't use the normal sight anymore- the LCD is perfect for the leisure photographer.  Although it might be a little smaller than other cameras, but the s400 LCD is perfect in relation to its size.  Plus, I'm sure battery life would be greatly diminished if the LCD was any bigger.  The actual shoot button is large enough for any sized finger to shoot.  This is sometimes important when you have other people taking your photo.  Many other cameras don't distinctly differentiate the shoot button from others and confuse many people.

-Performance-
Performance to me is going to be judged by how well it takes pictures under certain conditions.  I also would judge performance as how quickly it can take pictures, how long the battery lasts, and how good the pictures look to a normal user.  As far as how quickly it takes pictures, the s400 is pretty quick on startup.  After a quick startup sound, the camera is ready almost after 2 seconds.  Also, I've tried shooting pictures one after the other as fast as possible and have found there is a small lag of atleast 1.5 seconds of time between each consecutive shot.  Battery hasn't been an issue for me.  I have charged the s400 a maximum of only once after taking an average of 100 pictures.  I don't know if the battery performance is diminished on a larger memory card, but I have a 512mb card.  With more pictures, I imagine a larger search time to find space and when viewing locally, might take longer for each picture to be displayed.  Pictures taken are very good.  With the AiFocus (artificial intelligent focus), pictures are crisp, colored correctly, well balanced, and create great pictures.  After using ofoto.com as my picture printer, I've found there is simply no difference with this camera than a very very good point and shoot 35mm on print.  Any more detailed description of performance and you'll have to visit www.dpreview.com.

-Interface-
All the interface is referring to is the software, connectivity to a PC, memory slot, battery slot, charger, PC software, and navigation of the software locally.  The software on the s400 is good, not great.  Although it is a bit more on the sophisticated side, it wouldn't be ideal for a soccer mom.  The software navigation is OK and not the greatest, but again this camera isn't for the soccer mom.  Rather, this camera is more for a prosumer person who is looking for a G3 fit inside a small bodied envelope.  The software could be easier to use, especially by color coding a little bit.  Connectivity to a PC is OK, I do have problems with the fact that I can't send pictures to the PC without using the battery.  Other cameras with a cradle would avoid this issue altogether.  I guess the drawback to a cradle is the loss of battery charging more than one battery.  The memory slot is good, a little bit on the plasticky side, but it is good if you want to change memory all the time.  Battery slot is good as well, no complaints here.  The charger however is something to talk about.  It is small and easily taken anywhere with you.  This charger is much better than a cradle like the Casio z3.  It can be stowed and carried around much easier than anything.  I am impressed.  PC software is OK, I have seen better.  The amount of sophistication and level of editing that can be done from a scale to 1 to 10 and 10 being the best, the PC software manipulation is about a 4.  On the main package software called Zoom Browser EX, the only edits you can do is contrast, color, and brightness.  There is a nice piece of software called PhotoStitch which allows for panoramics and things of this nature- works OK as long as you follow the manual in using this feature on the s400.

-Value-
For the price, this camera is a lot more expensive than your run-of-the-mill 4 megapixel camera.  However, after looking any many other reviews on www.dpreview.com and www.stevesdigicams.com, I was able to see that this camera can take some of the best shots- even alongside the Canon G3, a completely prosumer camera thrice the size of this s400.  Although you might find 5megapixel and 6megapixel cameras out there, this 4megapixel does a great job.  After comparing photos with the Minolta G500, Fuji F100, Canon G3, Casio z4, Pentax s4, sony d-10, sony d-92, (list goes on), this camera is impressive on photo quality and size.  I've found that this camera will hit with the big hitters on everything- one of the best units in the market today.  Don't be fooled with a higher megapixel camera a smaller size, it won't take the photos that you're looking for.  This will.
