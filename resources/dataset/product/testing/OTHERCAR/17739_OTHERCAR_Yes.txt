            Cars are not top on my list of things I care to educate myself on, but my brand new Saturn SL2 4 door sedan is a thing of beauty. 

This car has proven to be safe, reliable, and &quot;good with gas&quot;. I would recommend it to women who do a lot of driving at night, alone or with the kids. 

We bought this vehicle mainly because the price was right, and the insurance was less than we expected. Other factors that lead to our final decision was the information we had gathered on the internet, and from friends, and the salespeople concerning the vehicle's safety, and the seats were extremely comfortable. 

Our Saturn does not have a lot of extra room in it, which is really the only drawback.

Our next car will definitely be a Saturn.
