            After reading the many reviews about this vehicle, I felt compelled to add my own review, as I too own a 1995 Dodge Neon.  I was attracted to the looks and the price when they first arrived on the scene back in the summer of 1994.  I purchased it brand new, and drove it off the lot on July 12th, 1995 (strangely enough, it had 84 miles on it).  Mine is an emerald (dark) green, two door Highline coupe.  I have had this car for almost eight years, and the date that I&#146m writing this is Monday February 18th, 2003.  

I know that these cars were not great cars to begin with, and I feel for all of the people who have the same model and turned out to be real lemons, as about 90% of all the reviews submitted here would indicate.  I must report, given these reviews, that this car has proven to be a VERY RELIABLE source of transportation for me.  My Neon has had and still has a few of the classic trademark Neon problems, but none have been serious of have hindered the car&#146s performance.  Here are mine:

1. WATER FILLING UP IN THE TAIL LIGHTS:
I don&#146t know why or how this happens, but I too had to remove the red lenses periodically to dump the water out.  It began to be a real pain after awhile, having to disconnect and reconnect the bulbs, and loosening and tightening the bolts that held the lenses in place.  Luckily, however, no water leaked into the trunk.  I finally had an idea, which may help some of the Neon owners who still have this problem.  I removed the lenses for one final time, and drilled 5 drainage holes at THE VERY BOTTOM of each of the lenses.  Well it worked, because since then (which was back in 1998), that problem has never occurred again.
2. THE BRAKES SQUEALING:
Yes, on occasion my brakes do squeal, but I found that it only happens when the pads are close to being in need of replacement.  It can be quite loud, and I have turned many heads when I have applied the brakes in areas where there are people around.  When this happens, my mechanic sands them down, and that usually remedies the problem.  They sometimes will squeal after a heavy rain when the brakes are applied the first few times, but it will diminish soon afterward.
3. THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT:
My light goes on and off while driving, but my mechanic is never able to find what the cause is.  I can tell you that whatever the reason may be, it does not in any way affect the car&#146s performance.  Strange.
4. THE OIL LEAK:
This began happening for the first time about three years ago.  I was told that it&#146s way too expensive to repair, so all I have to do is check the oil level every week.  The leak is not a major one, though, because I end up having to add a quart of oil only about every two weeks on average.  As long as I make sure that there&#146s enough oil in that crankcase and really monitor that level, I&#146m okay.  I even keep a case of oil in the trunk so that I can add it anytime, anywhere.  Hey, the way I look at it is this: what car DOESN&#146T leak oil at some point in its life?
5. AIR/WIND NOISE:
And yes, here&#146s another common one.  Because these cars have no door frames/pillars, you will hear the air blowing through between the window and the gasket.  On my model, however, this only happens on the passenger window and NOT the driver&#146s window.  Oh, and it only does this when the passenger door has recently been opened.  If I go for a long time without taking any passengers, there must be a "seal&#148 that&#146s formed and once it&#146s broken, then the air noise begins again.

That&#146s EVERYTHING!  That&#146s IT!  So, you see, my model is no different from the others as far as these minor annoyances go.  

I can tell you this: I have NEVER had a major problem with this car.  My transmission has never had to have been rebuilt or replaced even so much as one time, but I think it&#146s because I change the fluid and have a new kit installed, both on a yearly basis.  I also use the Slick 50 Annual Transmission Treatment.  Let me tell you, this stuff REALLY WORKS!  Everybody reading this right now may want to consider this for all subsequent vehicles that they purchase in the future!  I am convinced that if I was NOT changing the fluid and added the Slick 50, I would have had to have my transmission rebuilt at least once already!  Every component in the exhaust system is the factory original, even the muffler!  I maintain this car to the exact specifications in the owner&#146s manual, with oil changes every 3,000 miles, plus plugs, cables, air cleaners, etc., when needed.   This car idles and runs exceptionally smooth and quiet.  The body is in excellent shape with NO RUST and the paint finish is in excellent condition.  It is not faded, nor is it peeling or cracking, as other models do.  The only major components that I have had to replace have been two engine modules, the fuel injectors only once (they were clogged beyond belief) and the timing belt (no, it didn&#146t break on me &#150 it was just routine maintenance at 60,000 miles).  Everything else has been only minor parts, such as bulbs, tires, brake pads, etc.  I find that this car has exceptionally good handling, much better than a lot of other cars in this class, even better than the Chevrolet Cavalier if you can believe that!

Okay, now let me tell you how many miles this car now has.  Ready for this?  It has 139,700 miles!  Remember now, this is a 1995 model!  I have to replace the brakes every year, but that&#146s because I average about 20,000 miles a year, so that&#146s about normal &#150 just as long as I don&#146t wear them down to the rotors.  This is only my fourth car since I first started driving at the age of 18 (17 years ago).  This is also the car that I have owned the longest out of those four.  Even my mechanic is amazed that a Neon has this many miles on it!  He hates these cars, and calls them &#147throwaway cars&#148 (and he&#146s absolutely right!  THEY ARE!).  But it has never disappointed me and always gets me to where I need to go.  Bravo!

This has been an excellent vehicle that has provided basic transportation.  But I will probably be selling it at the end of this year, and will most likely try to find a pre-owned Toyota Corolla for their long reliability record.  At least I know that Toyotas can easily surpass my Neon&#146s miles with ease, without me having to worry about something major going wrong.  I&#146m somebody who likes to keep a vehicle for a long time, even long after it&#146s been paid off, and believe me, I got REALLY LUCKY with my Neon.  When I trade my Neon in, it will make a perfect practice car for a sixteen year-old that has just gotten his or her learner&#146s permit, and that&#146s about it.  With the high miles, I can&#146t imagine it serving any other purpose short of being sent to the junkyard.  That&#146s okay, though.  It&#146s done its job and has done it well, and it&#146s seen a much longer life than other 1995 Neons could ever hope to have seen.  I am just grateful that I was fortunate enough to have purchased one of the (VERY rare) &#147good ones.&#148

If I can offer any further suggestions or answer any questions for my fellow 1995 Dodge Neon owners out there, my e-mail address is amc_516@yahoo.com.
