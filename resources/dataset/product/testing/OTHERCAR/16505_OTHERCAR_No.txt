            I purchased my Cabrio in 1998 brand-spanking new. I have always loved this car and it has been a joy to drive, especially in the summer.  But as time passed, the car has showed increased problems. My cruise control would engage automatically and my alarm won't activate from the driver's side door anymore; the car has to be locked from the passenger's side. But the most troubling problem has been the deterioration of my convertible top. Roughly four months ago my pristinely clean, tan vinyl top began to turn a burnt orange color for no reason. And with this color, the top also became extremely sticky. It seemed as though the top was chemically breaking down. I determined that I must have done something to it to make it this way. So I did some research to try and find a cleaner to fix the problem (because nothing else was working)and found a group of 98 Cabrio owners who were experiencing the same problem. I contacted VW and told them of the problem and of the other owners and they simply said I was past my warranty and there was nothing they could do about it. No one ever saw the damage before this decision was made. I have seen the other owner's cars and have seen documented cases of the same problem. VW should look deeper into these cases to determine that it is likely that there is a defect here. All the cars affected by the top deterioration were 1998 Cabrios manufactured in late 1997 and 1998 at the Volkswagen plant in Mexico. Stay away from this model/year and I would warn you to stay away from VW in general. They do not stand by their products.
