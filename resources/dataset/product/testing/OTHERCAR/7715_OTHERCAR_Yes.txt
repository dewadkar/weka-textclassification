As the proud owner of a Chevy Tahoe, I can't imagine life without one.  It's roomy interior makes it feel as though you are driving around in your living room.  After driving this truck the others seem, well, wimpy.  The heated seats are great in the winter, and the air conditioner control for the backseat passengers is great in the summer. For a large family the car can be ideal. You will have enough room in the trunk for everything, including the kitchen sink!  

If you spend most of your time in an urban enviornment this may not be the car for you.  Garages may charge more due to it's massive size and finding a spot on city streets is certainly more difficult.  The Tahoe is great on country roads and any other rough terrain.  

It's also amazing how so many cupholders can come in handy on a long drive with a car full of people.
