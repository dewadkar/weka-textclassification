            To lease or purchase a certain vehicle you should do your homework first.For my application this truck fit the bill.I went on the net ,looked up info and asked owners on the street.The cherokee is going to replace my chev s10 if and when it dies,325000km and going strong.The jeep has all the bells and whistles,inside and out.Skid plates,two hooks,trac loc rear,select trac transfer case inside soup to nuts.The first thing I tell people that it is a truck,not a half car/truck!The sad thing is not to many drivers do what this thing was built for!OFF ROAD is where it shines!When I got it I broke it in nice and slow then took it moose hunting in northern canada.You put that baby in 4lo and you can go almost anywhere!Up hills so you only see sky,down gullies that only those little quad runners go.Towing back a 1500 pound bull moose on a trailer,up and down mountain highways,no problem!But you have to remember,I knew going in that gas was an issue,but I wanted low end power and gas was a mute issue.A lot of people buy vehicles and do things that they were not intended to do.If you tow,get the two package,if you off road get the proper protection!I cant say I hate anything about this vehicle,because I did my homework and made my decision based on my conclusions.If you want a car like ride buy a chev or ford,but look UNDER those trucks and tell yourself,what if I hit a rock,stump,or road debris?<br><br>
