            The Nikon Coolpix 2500 (coolpix) is a great inexpensive camera. It only costs about $250 and is definitely a great snapshot camera. All more this camera needs is a big smartcard (memory card), I suggest 64, or 128 mb, and a computer with usb connection.

One great feature about this camera is that there are a lot of shooting scenes. What this is, is that you set your camera to the kind of scene you are in. Such as fireworks,party, and many more.

This is a very good snapshot camera. There are 3 different qualities;Fine, the best which takes up about 1 mb for each photo , Normal, and basic The fine quality photos are great. Even the normal are good. I really suggest this camera if this is your first digital camera. 

You can also take 15 second movies with this camera. The default quality is normal, but it cannot be fine. They are very nice when you don't have a video camera handy. So you can take small movies of places that you were at that need to be animated, aswell as taking pictures. The only problem with this movie mode, is that it can only be 15 seconds, and that it can't be in fine quality

Another great thing is that the lens swivels. So you can take a picture of yourself while you see where its pointing. No more blind portrait shots. Also with the swivelable lens, you can get a shot of something really high just by moving the lens up and not moving the camera

I truly recommend this camera to anyone that is looking for a cheap, digital, snapshot camera. Who knows maybe you'll be the next Ansel Adams :-)
