             1997 I bought a 1992 chevy Beretta with 98,500 miles on it and it was all highway.  I knew the dealer, and when i test drove the car, it was pretty nice riding. The car really really ran very well. Once after I hit 100,000 the problems kicked in - over time.
  After paying $6,000 for it used, I must have spent another 3 grand in 3 years to fix it.  These were the following problems:

Altinator - twice
Brakes - 3 times
Power Steering
Exhaust system
Oil system
transmission
struts
shocks
Engine surging - 3 times
siezed engine - final blow to car.

This happened over 3 years.  I do not reccommend getting any beretta except the 1996 z26 model - their last line of Berettas.  I was stupid enough to keep the car and I weant to put you in the right direction
