            I have a 1996 Electric Blue Dodge Neon.  I would not recommend anyone to buy a car like mine.  Ever since I bought it it has been nothing but a bunch of problems!!  First, my speedometer stopped working after only having it for a couple of months.  And it still doesn't work!  Now, while driving down the road you hear clunk, clunk.  Driving home from work the other day, I was surprised to see my car smoking at the front end.  I immediately pulled over to find that my engine and everything under the hood was completely covered in oil.  Something blew up!  What a shock.  Also, the paint has been slowly chipping away in many places from different places on the car for about a year now.  For the price of this car, I can honestly say that it wasn't worth it!
I would tell anyone who was looking at a Neon to look harder and find something better!!
