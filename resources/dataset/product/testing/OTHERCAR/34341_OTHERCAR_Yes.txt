            I have rented this vehicle a few times when I traveling and found it incredibly comfortable. I first went with it since it was the only car in its class at the rental agency that had leather interior - I wanted to travel in style!

The car fits 6 comfortably. Room in the back is spacious - I had 3 full-size friends (ie they were not tiny people) and they had no problem fitting in it. 

One major problem with his car is the clearance on the bottom - it literally bottoms out on EVERYTHING! But I don't mind dine it corners so well and it accelerates at a decent speed.

I really don't know who would buy it.  It is your typical sporty sedan.  If I was looking for a sedan, I would buy it.<br><br>
