            In 1997, I found myself in the market for a car.  The one I had at the time broke down and I actually had to catch a ride to an auto dealership to look at cars.  I had two requirements for a new car, it had to have a sunroof and couldn't be a Hyundai.  Imagine my surprise when I drove off in a Hyundai Accent with no sunroof. One of the things that sold me on this car was how well it handled.  I bought a 1996 car for about $8800 after trading in my other broken down car.  In the 2 1/2 years that I've had it, its been to the shop three times.  Once for a window that got off track, once to have the brakes done and once for a tune-up.  Other than that, its been a perfect car.  Still gets incredible gas mileage and drives really well.  The only trouble I've had driving is in the snow.  As a young single working mom of an active 6 year old son, it is absolutely essential that I have a good working and easy to maintain car.  I've loved my car and would consider buying another Hyundai Accent in the future.  <br><br>
