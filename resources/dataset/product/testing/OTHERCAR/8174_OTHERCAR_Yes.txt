            When my Ford Escape was in the shop (again!), I ended up with a rental spanking new Audi A4. I have never driven an Audi but I wanted to see how they compared to their arch-rival, the BMW 3-series.

<b>Overall</b><br>
I was delighted to find that the Audi was a very quality piece. The car doors thudded with quality. The dashboard gleamed with a full set of gauges and the ergonomics were bang-on.  A sub-compact sports sedan, the car handled almost telepathically!

<b>Interior</b><br>
My biggest complaint about the Audi A4 was the uselessness of the rear seats. I'm only 5'9" but there was no way an adult could sit behind me. The driver seat was wonderfully firm and supportive, much better than the 3-series seats I've tried.

Controls were excellent. This rental Audi A4 was equipped with automatic and I had NO complaints at its responsiveness.  Some of the dash controls were hard to decipher without a manual - we spent a few minutes trying to figure out some lighting controls and the heating/ventilation.

<b>Overall</b>
Anyone who's forgotten about Audi needs to give it another look. For the money, an Audi A4 is apparently equal to a BMW 3-series but with a higher equipment level.  A little tighter interior (compared to the BMW 3-series), the upcoming new A4 is supposed to address the space issue.
