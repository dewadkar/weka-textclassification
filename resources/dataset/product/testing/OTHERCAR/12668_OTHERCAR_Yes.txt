            These are cute little cars.  I owned a 1994 model but my sister has owned two of these.  Both of the ones she has owned have been two door cars.  She wouldn't have anything else.  She is single and doesn't need anything bigger.

The car gets great gas mileage.  They are four cylinder cars and do not use a lot of gas.  They have a lot of pep though, they may be small but it will get up and go with out a doubt.

The first one she had she gave up in her divorce because he had borrowed money against which made the payments way to high for her.  It was a nice car.  I drove it several times because they lived with us for a while.  This car drove from Arizona and back and didn't give them any problems.

It was red, bright red two door.  It was an automatic and had no power locks or seats or anything like that.  The interior was a gray, light gray color.  The gear shift is in the console between the seats.  

The one she has now is black with dark tinted windows.  We searched for her a car forever.  She honestly would not even consider another car.  It was the Chevy Cavalier or nothing.  This one is also an automatic in the floor.  It has a charcoal color interior.  It doesn't have power anything either.

Both cars have AM/FM cassette radio, she will put a CD player in before long.  They both have huge trunks, I mean the trunk is as big as the whole car.  They both get excellent gas mileage.  The back seats are bit cramped but the only she puts back there are my kids or her boyfriends kids.

The red one they paid about $10,000 for it right after she got married.  The black one my dad helped her get, I think they paid $7,000 for it.

The cars ride smoothly and are very comfortable to drive.  I have never heard either one that she owns make any kind of noise while I was driving or riding.  The cars have small tires on them and they are very inexpensive tires.

The cars have never given her any trouble.  Like I said they drove it to Arizona and back to Tennessee and never had any problems.  The front seats are buckets style, they are every comfortable.  They can be adjusted back and forth and can be leaned all the way back.

However, the backseat is cramped.  It was not made for adults to ride in.  Kids fit back there very well.

They cars are very reliable.  However, if you have a large family this wouldn't be for you.  If you have more than two kids I wouldn't recommend this to you.

If you are single, if you have no kids or two or less, this car would be great.  If you do a lot of driving this car will save you bundles in gas.

Still not sure go check one out at your local Chevrolet dealer.  It is a very nice.  Taken car of this car could last a person a very long time.  By taken care of I mean keep the oil changed and tires rotated and balanced.

Thanks for reading and have a wonderful day.
