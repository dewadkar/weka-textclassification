            I had been drooling over this camera for several months when I got a bonus at work, so I decided to go ahead and buy it.  I bought it online and had a terrible experience with the company I bought it from, but the camera is great!

I bought a 64 megabyte flash card to go with it because I thought the 8 megabyte card that came with it would be too small.

My fiance and I went on a trip to Boston last weekend and took the camera with us.  While I was in meetings all day, he wandered around Boston and took pictures of all the wonderful architecture.  The camera battery lasted about eight hours, but we forgot to take the charger with us, so we didn't get any pictures of ourselves.  Dummies!  :)

The camera is small enough to fit in a shirt pocket, so there's no excuse for us not to come back with a ton of pictures to bore our friends with.  The picture quality is really good too.  I usually use the smallest file size setting and the pictures still look great!
