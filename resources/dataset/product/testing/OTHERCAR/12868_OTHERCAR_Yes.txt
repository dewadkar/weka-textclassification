            We've had a J30t in our family now for quite some time. The model we have isn't a 1997.5, but a 1995, so I'm sure there are newer features available on the more current ones, but in reality I don't know what more they could add to this incredible car.

The touring model of the J30 is the same as the base model except for a couple of changes. It has different rims, a spoiler, 4-wheel steering, and stiffer shocks.

To begin, this car is simply stunning. Reminiscent of old Jaguars, it has oval shapes running throughout, and the back end droops. Hard to describe using words, but there are few cars normal people can afford out there that look better than this. It's easily the best looking luxury car out there for certain.

Entering the car, you're again overwhelmed by how stylish and beautiful this car really is. The seats are just magnificent, and really encase you, giving you a very secure feeling. One minor gripe is that the steering column is set fairly low, which may be a problem for taller drivers (ie. me) since it doesn't tilt up very much.Once in, you encounter an elegant instrument panel, which uses a very classy font for the numbers on the dial. A small thing you might say, but it adds to the demeanor of the car. 

The texture of the dash and all of the other surfaces of the car are pleasant to the touch, and feel like quality. The radio included with the car is a Bose CD/tape player with AM/FM radio. You have to hear it to believe it. Bose has said that they designed the stereo specifically for the car, and it shows, because this is one of the best factory systems I've ever heard, with the 6 speakers doing an exemplary job of pumping out the music.

Climate control is off the set it and forget it type. Simply rotate the knob to the temperature you want, and the car does the rest.

The only sore spot in the interior is the backseats. Although the actual padding and bolstering is comfortable, 2 is a tight fit, with minimal legroom, and 3 is just torture. A tradeoff due to the cars shape I suppose.

And now for the engine. In the case of the J30, it's a 3.0 liter V6. Sound familiar to Nissan fans? Well it should. The engine used for the J30 is the same as the unaspirated version in the flagship 300ZX sportscar, tuned for a broader torque curve, and a more luxurious feel. Needless to say, the J30 can spin its tires at will, and has an enormous amount of power available for any need you may have. Listening to this engine, you might want to turn down the radio due to the fact it sounds so nice too. :)

Handling is above average. I think this is mainly due to the weight of the car. Although the J30 is a midsize auto, it's weight is fairly high. Consequently, in very fast manouevers, you'll experience quite a bit of lean, and gobs of understeer. To be honest, I never really felt the 4-wheel steering do much, although I have heard that it is supposed to work transparently.

The final issue with the J30 is its trunk. Due to the drooping rear end, it is very small, and barely holds two sets of golf clubs. But really, your clubs should be at the country club anyways, so who cares :)

In closing, the J30 is an amazing car, especially for the price. I think Nissan/Infiniti made a mistake by dropping it in favour of the bland Maxima clone I30, but then again, what do I know?
