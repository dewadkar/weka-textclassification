            but I am 5'4&quot;.   This is the first new car I have ever owned, and with previous cars (late 70's and early 80's &quot;boats&quot;) I had problems seeing over the hood.  It's a new experience for me to be able to see clearly in all directions.  I have taken taller people for rides, and their knees have been around their ears.

The car has a rather small trunk and not much room overall, which has been inconvenient at times when I needed to carry large items in it.  It has built in cupholders which are a good idea but which I rarely use as the cups tend to block my reach of the radio controls. 
  
This car has been very reliable for me; I've had no work done on it in 6 years other than routine maintenance.  The 4-cylinder engine tends to take a few minutes to get up to speed, especially when the air conditioner is running, but is also very economical; I average $20.00 a month or less in gas under normal circumstances.

 
It rides rather low to the ground and has a tendency to stall when there is very deep standing water; I used to live in an easily flooded area and this was a problem on occasion.
 
If you are tall, have a large family or require quick acceleration this car is probably not for you.  If you are short and value economy and reliability, it just might be.  I'll give serious thought to buying another one when the time comes.<br><br>
