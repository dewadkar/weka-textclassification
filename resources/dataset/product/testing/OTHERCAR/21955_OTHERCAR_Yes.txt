            Here's the point: The X5 was designed from the ground up to be the best performing, most luxurious, most comfortable, and safest SUV on the planet.  

There's nothing quite as serenely relaxing as 134 miles per hour while sitting tall in the X5's command position-- that's all I could manage due to traffic on a recent run from Munich to Stuttgart--but the top speed is actually 142. Unfortunately my X5 is still a few weeks away from delivery, but I think the 500+ miles I spent with a pre-production version in Germany makes me a qualified reviewer.  Read on:

Pulling out of Munich, an eager 5.9 liter Jeep Grand Cherokee thought he would be able to play. But as we edged over the far side of 100 mph, the Jeep's brakes, steering and off-road suspension soon proved their real-life danger: as an errant Renault Clio moved into the fast lane to pass a truck, the Jeep was forced to panic brake.  The whole vehicle swerved and literally careened to the side, while the driver fought to keep the car from tipping.  The driver came within a hair's breadth of serious injury.

In the X5, the event was not nearly so dramatic.  Nail the brakes, and 4 super size calipers lock the car down.  Duh, it's a BMW.  It was built to do that.

So there's my bias--I drive on road most of the time, so I want the world's best on-road performance and safety.  I like to drive quickly, I know a few good on-ramps and back roads where that's possible.  On-road is where I spend 90% of my time.  

My off-road driving amounts to skiing in Tahoe, pulling a boat to the lake, and visiting my father-in-law's duck blind (in a gooey central california mud-hole).  With the X5, I'm not going to get stuck going to any of these places, but I will arrive in total comfort!

Anyway, here are some more facts--enjoy!




Best Motor: The 282hp motor from the BMW 740il delivers class leading performance (possible exception being ML55 - official BMW times are 7.5 sec 0-60, magazine tests of the $65K AMG ML55 are 6.9 secs, but BMW factory tends to be conservative.)

Best Transmission: Only SUV with 5 speed step-tronic (you can shift click-click-click like on a motorcycle but with no clutch).  Or just chose Drive or sport mode.  This transmission is so smart it knows to do things like holding the same gear when you suddenly lift throttle in a corner--most transmissions would upshift, which could lead to a spin.

Best Safety: 10 Airbags (driver and passenger each get front, side and head airbags, rear occupants get side and head); the torsional rigidity of a 7 Series; BMW internal crash tests indicate this is the safest vehicle yet built; the most sophisticated traction control; rear tailgate with 2 locking mechanisms (not a center lock as in hatchback designs). 


Best Environmentalism:  The ONLY SUV to have 3-way catalytic converters that are electrically heated to minimize emissions on start up (Did you hear about the new law requiring that will require SUVs and pick-up trucks to reduce their emissions by up to 800% by 2004?  This vehicle already meets the new standards.

BEST aerodynamics of any SUV (check out the flat undercarriage) 

This list could go on and on and on.  Maybe I'll put together a site that goes though everthing in more detail.<br><br>
