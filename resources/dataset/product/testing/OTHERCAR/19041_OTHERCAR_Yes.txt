            I bought this camera for $487 at www.accompany.com on 4/07/200(now www.mopshop.com). How did I get such a low price? Buying as a group yields a price of $609, plus a 20% off coupon gives $487.
This camera's picture quality is excellent.I was able to print 8x10 on an Epson 750 and the sharpness was comparable to 8x10 printed from a 35 mm film (I have a friend at work who took similar pictures with 35mm and printed on 8x10). The rechargeable battery with a charger were included. Since this camera uses 4 AA battery all I needed was buying an extra set of rechargeable battery for about $15 rather than spending $100 had I bought the Canon S10 or the Nikon 950. The camera is compact and fairly easy to use. I am nearsighted, so the diopter is a great help.
Overall, even without the 20% coupon for the price of $600 I still think this is a good buy. 
However there are a few things I need to point out:
- When you turn on the power make sure to remove the lens cap first, else the lens cannot stick out and get stuck. Doing this several times may damage the lens motor, I think.
- This camera has a panoramic feature, which helps you to take several pictures that later can be stitched by a software program. However you have to buy an Olympus memory for this feature to work.
- Sooner or later you will loose the lens cap, so rush out and buy the attachment (about  $2 in any camera store)
