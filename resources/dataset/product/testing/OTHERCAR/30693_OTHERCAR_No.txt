            They say you get what you pay for, and in the case of the Pontiac Sunfire, this is definately true.  I recently took one out for a 100-mile test drive.  I actually did like it quite a bit.  I had to keep reminding myself not to be too harsh and remember this is an economy class vehicle. I'm used to mid-size luxury sedans, but I must say I had a blast driving this cute little bug.  

The body styling is sleek and stylish, very eye-catching.  I saw several nods of approval as I drove through my college campus.  The headlights are a unique aspect, giving it an aggressive appearance.  It looks very aerodynamic, like it could really move, but it has actually received criticism for being too wind-resistant.  I think this particular vehicle looks it's best as a convertible with the top down.  

The interior is decent, but leaves something to be desired.  It is almost exactly like it's sister vehicle, the Chevy Cavalier. It looks slightly but not entirely cheap on the inside.  All the knobs and dials and screens are easy to reach and easy to see and the driver's seat was surprisingly comfortable, though the passenger offered a few complaints and my back became sore towards the 75-mile mark.  There also is very little room in the backseat, certainly not enough for a third passenger to be comfortable for any length of time.  There isn't a trunk to speak of, either. Trips out of town would be difficult for one, next to impossible for two.  Lack of power anything proved to extremely irritating, especially since the windows were incredibly difficult to crank and I came away with scratched and sore fingers. My hands are tiny and I couldn't get a hold of the knob..a man with larger hands would have a much more difficult time. 

It was a lot of fun to drive. I especially liked the sound of the motor revving as I pulled away from a stop light or sped up.  It is a very capable vehicle in terms of speed and horsepower.  It reached 90mph without a struggle, which was more than what I was expecting.  Handling was quick and responsive, as was braking.  The pedals felt firm and comfortable, no unnecessary give.  There was a bit of vibration, but nothing that woudln't be normal for an economy class car.  

One thing that is incredibly dissappointing is it's inability to hold it's market value.  They drop significantly year after year.  Where it is normal for a car to lose a good part of it's value in the first two years, this car continues to lose significant value beyond that mark.  A new Sunfire can be purchased for $15,000, if not more...in three years, it is worth no more than $8000. I think if you only intend to keep the car for a year or so and then trade it in, it would be a good,fun car for a younger person, but if you intend on keeping it for 2 or more years, you'd be better off with something else.
