            I loved my 1995 4 door Elantra. It got great gas mileage. It had a great sound system. I loved the size of the car, it was perfect for 3 people.
If you want economy and you don't care about trading it in.
Then go for it. I did worry about the body of the car, it dented easily. I had an accident with my car, it cost more to get it fixed than to pay the blue book value. So  my insurance co.
only paid the blue book value, when the insurance paid the
bank off, I still owed $2000 more on the car. I couldn't believe 
that this cars value drop so much.  That will be the last time
I will buy this type of car.  I may buy one used but not new.
Then I wouldn't feel so bad about losing so much money.<br><br>
