            We bought a 99 Chevy Z71 pickup in March.  We have always been Chevy people, but this time we were going to look around.  We looked at Fords and Dodges, and while cheaper, they weren't quite up to our Chevrolet standards.

The exteriors of all we looked at were fine, actually they all have the same basic look in 99.  It was the interior that won us over.  Even the top of the line Dodges, and Fords in particular, had a cheap look and feel.

Our only complaint with the truck so far is about the tires.  We paid an upcharge for Firestone Wilderness AT tires, thinking they would be better suited for &quot;all terrain.&quot;  Within 7000 miles we had to replace 2 tires.

All in all..great truck!  When I see a comparable Ford or Dodge, I just think &quot;Whew, glad we didn't settle for that!&quot;<br><br>
