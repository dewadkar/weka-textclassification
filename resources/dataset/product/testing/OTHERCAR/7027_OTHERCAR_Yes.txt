            After having a 2002 std outback wagon (And loving it), these are my initial impressions. Softer, engine runs very well, the moon roof gives you amazing space. I like the change in Rims as well, the old gold color was not good taste. Nice touch the addition of lumbar adjustment, too bad is only for the driver. I loved the look of the car , raised on the tail, lower at the front, gives a lot of character. 


Here comes my gripes about it. 
1- I suppose that making the suspension softer, gives you more quality ride.... well wrong. The Std stiff suspension, but still, comfortable, was great, I hate this change. It takes out the pleasure of driving (sharp cornering), and takes a way the great look (Tail raised, front lower). For me, that is the beauty of these cars. Pretty bad decision on these side. Subaru should give us customers the choice to select the type of suspension. Now, the car has much more body roll . 

2- I was used to drive 6 hours straight, and get out of my old 2002 std Outback without any pain, as the seats were incredibly good. Now, despite the leather trim, the seats feel terrible (Well, not as terrific I must say). What is going on in Subaru??? The bucket seat in this new car is too wide, so it does not feel comfortable on the sides, something that is key.

3- The front bumper redesigned: Total mistake in my opinion, I love the old design, they took away the mini spoilers on the side and front. Again, one of the best things that made the old Subaru stand out. 

4- Compass. Totally unreliable. How about driving 6 hours from Washington to NY, and it was pointing E and SE all the time!?.
