            Dollars:

I am Canadian so all will be CND $'s.  

In Canada they cost $42,000 for the EX or $44,000 for the EX-L with freight included.  The only difference is leather trim and heated seats.  To me this is a great value for an 8 Passenger SUV that gets reasonable fuel economy.  If you have a large family you were stuck with vans or gas guzzlers to haul your family.  Maintenance will run you less than all other SUV's this size because of the integration of some drivetrain components, and the 8000km frequency of oil changes.  The trailer tow package is expensive ($950) because you need a power steering cooler and a transmission cooler on top of the hitch.  If you want Honda quality you will have to suffer high interest rates like 7.5% for 5 years, no 0% like GM or Ford.

Fun Factor:

It was great to drive!  I drove it hard and it responded well. Comparing this to the other Mid size and Full size SUV's, this was the best.  It cruises quietly down the highway with total comfort and stays flat in the hard corners.  I had a smile on my face the whole time!  Off road it was a blast, you can lock all 4 tires in 1st 2nd and reverse.  Hills, a bit of mud and wheel hanging ruts are no problem.  Keep in mind its to big and heavy to do serious off roading and has no skid plating or low range.  All the SUV's that do offer better off road manners never seem to go there.  This truck is for those of us who have admitted that the "Camel Trophy" race, is not going to happen with their $40,000 Toy.  The CD player has a built in sub woofer, need I say more!    

Drivetrain:

Identical to the Acura MDX, this is a newer concept that should all but replace the mid size industry standard.  It can only tow 3500lbs. or a 4500lb. boat, but the smaller SUV's get thrown around by their larger loads anyhow and don't feel all that safe.  For larger tow jobs than 4500lb. I want a heavy hauler only.  It runs front wheel drive full time and monitors the rear for wheel spin.  It takes power away from spinning wheels and sends it to the traction tires.  The computer also sends power to the rear any time you stomp on is to prevent you from breaking loose in the first place.  This is first proactive system I have seen, keep it up Honda.  All other similar systems wait for slippage and then engage.  This can jolt you straight and be  a little unnerving.  The engine has enough power and still retains some economy.  If the statistics are right it will last forever, as do other Honda engines.  

Utility:

It can hold a 8 for short trips but the third row should be for kids only on long hauls.  The seats fold flat to the floor fast and with no removal required.  60/40 split on both back rows is standard, and it is full of great ergonomics.  Everyone has a cup holder and a good view thanks to theater style seating with each row higher than the one in front of it.  The drivers console has a place for a cell phone with charger, cards, pen, drinks, cd's and more.  Good supporting seats for long hauls, and low energy glass for less fan noise to run the AC on those hot days.  

Conclusion:

If you have 4 kids like me and hate vans, you now have an option.  Myself I could not tolerate the gas for a full size SUV because of the mileage I do with mostly just my but on the road.  The total cost is less for the Honda than a full size and it does what I want and need.  I take delivery of mine September 20th or so.
