            We bought our Dodge Caravan in August 1996. We had a Plymouth Sundance which we had definitely outgrown! We also wanted to be able to transport more than 4 people comfortably when we needed to.

I love my van because of the space,reliability, flexibility,and the price. 

Space/Flexibility - we have room to carry just about anything. If we want to carry 8 people, we use all of the seats and we can.  If we need to carry just our family of 4, we can use all of the seats and spread out, or we can take out one seat, and use the extra space for cargo. If we need all cargo, we can remove both seats and go for it.

Reliability - we have had very little repairs.  The ones we have had were just for routine repairs.  I have had three Chrysler-Plymouth-Dodge vehicles and all have been extremely reliable and virtually free of major repairs.

Price - the van we purchased was around 18,500 which was very afforable compared to other vans and cars.  For the benefits we received, the price was well worth it!

I love my van and plan to keep it as long as possible.<br><br>
