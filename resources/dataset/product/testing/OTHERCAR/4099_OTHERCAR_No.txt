            This vehicle was originally purchased because my wife agreed to drive it after one year.  I would than be able to purchase an F-150 4X4 extended cab.  Needless to say that deal has fell through and has left a mildly bad taste in my mouth.  

The 1998 Olds Intrigue GL 3.8 I have is loaded to the gills, but lacks several things.  The first problem I have noticed, along with several other intrigue owners, is the front-end.  I already have had to take this vehicle in to have the front bearings replaced.  I also have had to replace the moldings along the outside of the doors which were causing the doors to stick when opening them.  The brakes have also needed to be replaced with an upgrade that is available on the newer models.  It appears that the engine runs very hot and takes several hours to cool down after an hour of rush hour traffic on a 90 degree day.  There also appears to be a new problem that is appearing with the traction control system.  If you turn the wheel all the way to the right or left and punch it, the front end vibrates enough to make the CD player skip.  Needless to say, it is going back to the shop to have this replaced.  All of these problems have been improved on the newer models.  

With all of the problems, there are some benefits.  This car drives and handles remarkably well.  I have compared the handling to a Taurus, Grand Prix, and a Regal and it wins hands down.  It also beats the camry and accord is this department.  The 195 horses in the 3.8 will keep the average driver enthusiastic about the performance and should continue to run for a long time.  They have beefed the engine up in the newer models to 215 horses.  The stereo system is excellent, producing load and clear sound.  The interior is comfortable and is bigger than the previous cars I talked about.  The styling on the Intrigue is also original and sleek.  One more thing, exterior noise is almost non-existent in the cabin, making for a pleasant conversation with my wife about how I should of bought the F-150.

Do not buy this vehicle if you are in to horsepower.  You might have a problem beating the Grand Prix GTP.  Buy this car if you are looking to be bored in the cockpit and not feel the world around you.  Buy this car if you are a women, but do not if you are a man. <br><br>
