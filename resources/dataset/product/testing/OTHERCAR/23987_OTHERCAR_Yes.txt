            We came to own our 1993 Grand Marquis LS via a classic route:  aging parents can't drive anymore and want to sell their garaged cream puff with, get this, 36,000 miles on it.  Well now, they didn't have too look far for a buyer!  Actually, my wife called the shots on this one, since she frequently chauffeurs her folks around and needs this sedan's roominess and four doors.  

And big and roomy it is.  The last of its kind:  a full size, rear wheel drive, V8 powered American sedan.  Along with her blue oval sister ships, the Crown Victoria and the Town Car, Ford is holding out as the last supplier of this aged but proven platform.  God Bless'em.

Okay, plus and minus time, first the plusses:

* An excellent body, quiet and squeak free.
* Surprisingly good power from the 4.6 liter OHC V8.
* Good, but not great ride.  Best on the highway, natch!
* A trunk big enough for all the Sopranos bodies.
* Pleasing styling.  It doesn't look dowdy.
* Excellent paint and high quality leather seats.

Now the minuses:

* Absolutely numb steering.  Overboosted and under-castered so seniors can   turn the wheel easily, but jeez, it doesn't know where straight is!
* Plastic everywhere.  Interior hardware tends to come adrift.
* Standard AM/FM/Cassette stereo is barely adequate.  Cheap speakers.
* Old style speedo with few gauges.  Understandable considering the target   buyer.
* Uneven tire wear from soft suspension, weight and front end geometry.
* Shallow seats - could use a little more leg support.

There's one other thing that bothers me about this car.  When I'm under the hood, I see several rusting pieces - suspension braces, metal mounting plates, and so on.  They've been left unprotected by the factory and are certainly not cause for alarm, but are warts in an otherwise well done engine bay.

Although this car has been relatively trouble free while my wife's folks have owned it, we don't have enough time under our belts with it to comment on reliability or maintenance costs.  But I'd be willing to bet both will be good.  Heck, even Kommisar Nader's Konsumer Reports likes this car - and it's not even a Japanese brand!

My wife likes this car and I find enough good things about it to keep it from becoming a total yawner.  Notice I said &quot;likes&quot;, you just can't fall in love with a car this utilitarian.  It's an automotive appliance, to be sure, but competent enough to earn your respect if not your love.
