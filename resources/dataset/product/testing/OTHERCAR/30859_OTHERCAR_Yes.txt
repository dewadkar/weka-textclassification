            This past Christmas I decided to splurge and buy my wife a new car. My noble and loving concerns were for her comfort, safety and personal prestige. After shopping around and considering several makes, I read a favorable review of the Suzuki Grand Vitara in Kipplinger's Reports. It sounded like the ideal vehicle for her -- sporty, good handling, double air bags, and it came with four-wheel drive. I test drove one and fell in love again -- with this saucy little foreigner. I also fell in love with the price tag -- under $18.5K loaded. I did, however, get it in standard (or stick) drive which saved me $700 or so and added to the driving experience. Or so I thought. I selected a model in hunter green, perfect for the upscale suburbs where we live. This baby wouldn't be embarrassed pulling up to Mercedes wagons and Volvo's at our son's private school! It would hold it's head up proudly at the lacrosse game without losing face at the town dump. Christmas morning arrived. She was baffled by the car keys under the tree but dutifully followed the ribbon leading out into the garage. She beamed when she saw her present sporting a red ribbon and her new wheels beamed back. This love affair proved short-lived, however. Over the course of the next few weeks, my wife became less and less enthusiastic about driving her new car, shifting in bumper to bumper traffic, and some near accidents from trying to talk on the cell phone, drink coffee and down-shift at the same time. Soon thereafter, my wife swapped cars with me. She got the big, boring, Buick Century with automatic everything and I &quot;took&quot; the crazy little shifter &quot;off her hands&quot;. She was happy again. And I quietly, decently, &quot;endured&quot; -- with a spunky V-6 beauty that I love driving everyday. I had my cake and a happy wife to boot. Sometimes life throws you a curve. Sometimes you get to knock that curve out of the park.
