            I've needed a digital camera for some time now. A trip to my local electrical store gave me the chance to check out the latest and greatest. I was leaning strongly towards a Canon Ixus V2 when this little beauty caught my eye. I picked it up, played with it for all of 30 seconds before I knew I had to have it.

Getting start with it is extremely easy. Just plug in the power to the cradle, plug it into a free usb port and you're ready to go. While it was charging (2 hours for a full charge) I had a quick read of the basic printed owners manual - this is really just a getting started guide but useful nonetheless.

A full manual comes on the CD in Acrobat format, though everythings so simple you probably won't need it.

So, we're fully charged and ready to go. I know everybody raves about the size of it but it is simply amazing. It has exactly the same dimensions of a credit card and it about a centimetre thick. It has a brushed metal case which feels extremely sturdy - the whole overall feel is one of quality.

Switch it on and it's ready to go in under a second, making it a true point and shoot digital camera. The lcd display on the back of the camera puts many larger cameras to shame, it is bright and clear. Lining up for a shot with the optical viewfinder shows one of the first (very few) shortcomings. The optical viewfinder is round, making it very hard to frame a shot accurately which is a shame, though with long battery life and a great lcd display you probably won't be too put off by this. Click the shutter and you're ready for the next photo almost immediatly even when you're using the flash.

As with most digital camera, you have plenty of options, with resolutions of 1600 x 1200, 1280 x 960 or 640 x 480 with fine, normal and economy modes. You can also take 30 second movies - just select movie mode and press the shutter. The movie quality wastn't fantastic with 15fps at 320 by 240 but plenty good enough and a great additional feature to have.

The menu is accessible by pressing the menu button - you then navigate it with a small metal joystick. This is a little fiddly but you get used to it very quickly so don't be put off by that. There are plenty of modes to play with such as digital zoom, white balance and a self timer, all accessible through the simple menu system. There is also a best-shot mode. You cycle through several example pictures and pick the one that best matches the shot you're taking then take the shot. This is a great idea for the novice photographer and seems to work pretty well.

There is a switch on the back that switches between play and record modes. Switch it to play and you can look at all the photos and movies you taken, zoom and resize them, copy them to the camera's internal memory (12mb), protect them and add them to favourites.

After taking some photos and movies I plugged it back into the docking station. Once little complaint here is that the recessed cradle plug on the camera is protected by a small plastic cover which you unclip. This is almost certainly going to get lost, either being slipped off by clumsy fingers when using the camera or dropped when you're docking the camera. I feel that this could have been done better. 

When docked, the camera switches off and going into power charge mode shown by a red led on the charger. Switch it on and it appears immediatly as a removeable drive so you can get straight on with viewing and editing your photos. You get software with it called Photo Loader - this site in the background and, as soon as you connect the camera, it wakes up and pulls all the photos over to a directory you designate and builds a little html preview of them - excellent. So, if youre in a hurry just plug it in, wait for the photos to be transferred and off you go.

Looking at the photos, the quality is pretty impressive. It is not perfect, with the pictures looking a tiny bit softer then you might expect but not disappointingly so and perfectly good enough for most situations though if you are looking for very good quality photos then I suggest you look elsewhere. This is a subjective issue but I feel that the vast majority of people will be more then happy with the quality - I definitely am. The movies are also pretty impressive. You can only take a movie that's 30 seconds long but you can take as many as you like (well, until your storage card is full). They are stored as avi files and can be played straight off the memory card when the camera is docked.

This camera does have a couple of shortcomings - no optical zoom or macro mode and that's about it. However, what it does is does superbly. It would be nice if it came with a case too, as I feel that it needs one and that is the next purchase I am going to make.

Overall impressions - I am blown away by this camera. The sheer size of it is just amazing, it feels rugged, it looks fantastic, it basically feels just right and has a great gadget factor. It is so small you can take it anywhere and the fast startup times means you'll never miss a shot. I am delighted with my purchase and I'm sure you will be too if you pick this little beauty.
