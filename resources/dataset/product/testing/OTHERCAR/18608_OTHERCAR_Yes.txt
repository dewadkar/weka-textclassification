            I needed to replace my 1988 Buick Regal 3.6L V6.  I didn't want to spend the $400.00 plus monthly payment for a new Regal.  However, after driving only Buick cars for the last 15 years I have become very picky about my cars.  Alero was the only vehicle I could find acceptable to replace my Regal and I could easily afford at $225.00 per month lease for 36 months.  That price includes the 2.3L V6 that really propels the relatively lighter Alero.   I was really impressed with Alero's 4-wheel disk brakes, good acceleration, and road hugging suspension.   I really like the value in Alero.   The only problem I have noticed is that the right hand front door leaks water in a blown rain storm.  You should be aware that 9 service bulletins have been written against the Alero; none appear to be a significant problem.  After being in an accident where a Plymouth Caravan hit my new Buick Century in the center of the right hand side and I survived with only a bruised rib while the Century was Totaled, I often wonder how well I would survive a similar accident in the Alero which is a smaller and lighter car.     <br><br>
