            I owned a Cutlass for five years after a five year period of being owned by parents.  It was my first car and for the longest time I didn't think I would drive anything else.  The car isn't a sports car and can't go above 90 MPH but it has really good get up in go.  This varies noticeably during weather changes though.  In the winter it usually gave me trouble when trying to start when it was 30 degrees or below.  Yet it always started after a few tries.  The alternator went out once but that is common when a car is over 9 years old.   The only other trouble that the car gave me was with the air conditioner which isn't all too uncommon in cars 9 years and older either.  Overall this car provided me with a ride year round with minimum hassle until it became 8 years old.  That is a long time to have a reliable car.  So overall I rate this car as Reliable.<br><br>
