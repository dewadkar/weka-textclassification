            My husband surprised me for HIS birthday and bought ME a beautiful, used, shiny, white, 1994 Chrysler LHS. He was captivated by the looks and the price. Apparently the dealer could not move it off the lot so kept lowering the price. It also had 100,000 miles on it, which made me a bit nervous. However,considering the original cost, upwards of $32,000, we DID get a great deal.
Keeping that in mind, I can go on to say that if I were buying this car new, NO WAY would I pay even close to what it sells for. I tend to feel sorry for the person who bought it , added all the features that we now enjoy, thinking how much he had to shell out for it, only to discover the downside to this vehicle. 
First of all, it is a surprisingly &quot;noisy&quot; ride considering the type of car it is. The seatbelts no longer retract, the headlights are dim, defrosting the inside side windows takes forever at the highest setting, and if you want to get a shower, just open the car door a crack when it is raining outside. Due to the shape of the car, which I admit LOOKS nice, the design is far from practical . I won't even mention that because of the high back end, there is NO way to look out the back window to see behind you, unless sky is all you want to see! 
For the money we paid, I am thrilled with my car. It is very roomy and comfortable to drive. We have only had a few minor problems, but then I don't use it much.
 It is amazing to me that they can charge the price of a small house for a new one, which as I said, I would never buy. However , for the money we paid, it's great.( so far!)<br><br>
