            I bought the TT for a number of reasons.  First, its looks are stunning.  The dash is simplistic with a great look.  The exterior shape is like nothing out there.  The glass rear window can't be matched.  The aluminum roll bars accent the car more than anything out on the road.  Also, the glass windscreen, while minimally effective beats the black mesh seen on other roadsters.  Add to this the beauty of Quattro (all wheel drive) and you have a car that can't be beat.

Of course the handling in wonderful, acceleration is powerful and braking is top notch.  Also, the 4-year, 50,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty including maintenance cannot be beat.

On the downside, like any convertible, visibility is a nightmare.  Also, the trunk is great for small trips, but don't plan on anything huge.  Turbo diverter valves have also been a problem in a large number of cars (mine has gone through two).

If you are looking at the Porsche Boxster, Honda S2000, BMW Z3, Mercedes SLK, or the Saab 9.3 convertible you owe it to yourself to take the TT roadster for a spin.

I have owned a Celica convertible, Mustang convertible, and Eclipse convertible and the Audi TT beats all of them hands down.<br><br>
