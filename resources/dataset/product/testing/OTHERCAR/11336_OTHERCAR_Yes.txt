            When I first sat in the Dodge Grand Caravan, I thought for sure angels were going to start singing, and I started looking for the puffy clouds, and the bright light! I though for sure I must have died and gone to heaven! 

The wonderful options, and the ease of driving this made me want it NOW!!! Unfortunately it was a rental, and I had to give it back after a week, but boy, I know what my next car is going to be!

The double doors, made it easy to get the children in and out of it. The storage area in the back COULD have been a bit bigger, but I was still able to transport 2 weeks worth of groceries for 6 people, along with 3 children in car seats and 3 adults, and we didn't feel cramped for space at all. Rear A/C and Heat made it comfortable for everyone in the car. I WILL DEFINITELY GET ONE OF THESE!!!!!!!!<br><br>
