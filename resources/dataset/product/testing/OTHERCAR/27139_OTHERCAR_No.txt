            It took me two years to decide on a new vehicle.  I have always been a Ford girl-- but took the plunge and bought a Dodge.  After a year I am still not convinced that I made the right decision.  There is so much road noise in my car that it is hard to hold a conversation with anyone in the back seat.  There have been very few problems with it.  My ignition froze and I couldn't turn my car off one day last winter.  My cruise control also has gone out.  Everything was fixed under warranty.  The Avenger corners like a dreams and handles well.  The seats are okay, seem to be really hard by the end of a long road trip.  Overall the car is okay.  I put on over 25,000 miles a year and was expecting more than okay.<br><br>
