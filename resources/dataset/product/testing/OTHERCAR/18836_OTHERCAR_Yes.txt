            I bought my Panasonic online and got it for a steal - $350.00 not including S&H, with a $100 rebate from Panasonic that, miracle of miracles, actually came in. The camera looks and feels like a solid, very dependable piece of machinery. It can be heavy hanging around your neck by the included neck strap, but if you are used to a Polaroid or a good quality SLR camera, this one would meet your needs for feeling that weight to steady you. 

I have had tons of fun with this camera, shooting in all kinds of conditions with mostly memorable results. The 3X Optical zoom is adequate for most of my shots, and the ability to use the digital zoom gets me where I need to go. The auto-focus is a great thing once you get used to the pause while you depress the shutter button. For an amateur who likes to take photos on the fly, it's a good deal. 
If you're a pro, this is NOT a camera that will make you happy. The camera takes a lot of the decisions out of your hands, which saves a lot of confusion for the general hobbyist, but would drive a pro right out of her tree(first-hand reports from my partner, who uses an SLR for important shots). 

Keep in mind this is a 1.3 Mega Pixel camera, so for intense shots you can make "National Geographic" with, you'll want something much more expensive. This is definitely a recreational piece of equipment. 

If you can get the camera for $150.00 more than I paid for it you'd be getting yourself a good deal. The actual one I got was factory refurbished, but still came with a warranty(which may vary by dealer), as well as a rechargeable battery, the charger, a USB connector to get the pictures from the camera to your PC, and a CD for installation purposes.

The neatest thing about this camera is what it uses for storage media. It has a SuperDisk which holds 120Mb of data, which translates to 1500 pictures on Fine resolution, or 83 floppy disks worth of stuff. Stuff meaning you can use the camera like a Zip drive, using the USB connection to transport any data you want.
