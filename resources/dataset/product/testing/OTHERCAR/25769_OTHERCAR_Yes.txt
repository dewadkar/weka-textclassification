            When my boyfriend-at-the-time suggested I look at the Altima, my reaction was not very favorable.  I thought the car was &quot;ugly&quot;.  He said I should at least test drive it because he had heard some great things about it.  I had looked at and driven similar cars but I was not prepared for the joy I experienced when I drove the Altima!  It just had so much get up and go compared to the competitors.  I think I was immediately sold just for that feature!

Anyway, I ended up purchasing my 1993 Nissan Altima GXE.  There's plenty of room, it gets decent gas mileage, and it has been virtually maintenance free!  I'm fast approaching 98,000 miles.  Besides normal maintenance, I've had the breaks replaced twice, but the first time was not until the car was 5 years old and I blame the brake repair shop for their shoddy product and service that caused the second replacement.  The only other trouble I had was a minor problem with the gear shift.  It was a quick fix at the dealership. 

I have two small children whose car seats take up the majority of the backseat, but on trips we're still able to get all our luggage into the roomy trunk.  There's also a little pass-through from the backseat to the trunk which makes it easy to store or retrieve items without getting out and opening the trunk.

And did I mention the wonderful experience I had purchasing and servicing my car at the local Nissan dealership?  I have been very impressed with the personnel which is another contributing factor.

I know the time will come when I will need to replace my Altima and I hope to do so with a newer model.  I know I've had alot of people purchase Altimas on my recommendation!<br><br>
