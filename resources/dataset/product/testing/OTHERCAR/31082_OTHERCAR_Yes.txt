            When I purchased my Toyota Tundra two months ago I was astounded by the features and performance of the truck.  I used to drive a Lexus LS400 and was worried about the how much rougher the ride would be in a Tundra but surprisingly the ride was incredibly smooth. The road noise was very quiet and the shocks and suspension made it feel like you were in a Luxury car. Also, The off-road capability is incredible. I went through ditches that many other pick up trucks bottomed out in. The only bad thing about the Tundra was that it cost about 30,000 dollars but that is the only way it is comparable to the GMC/Chevy Z71 Truck. The is by far the best performing and most versatile Truck in it class!
