                 Daddy's best girl before me in 1976 was his corvette. When my little sister Jilly was born, he decided that it was not a practical family car, and took it to a car show where it was sold. I will never forget riding in it. Because sports cars are not a &quot;family car&quot;, he wanted a luxury car. He swept Jilly and me off to the car salesman, sold off his Saturn, and that night he took us for a ride to the driving range to test it out once again. The lot was empty and the sky was bright and clear. I was only 10 but I can still remember the soft leather seats. I loved it. If you like a smooth ride, a car that glides above the ground, this is your lucky chance. <br><br>
