            i picked up this car for a good price locally.  the car has a 1.8L I-4 8V engine in it.  for a 16 year old 4 cylinder car i must say it accelerates quite quickly!  the thing can also corner extremely well, i have yet to come across a car of it's vintage/class that can compare.

the car has been extremely reliable, only 1 fuel pump problem so far that has been serious.  everything else has been trivial and i expect it to be that way, though i have scoped out prices on various parts and overall it's expensive.

the car is a great car for anybody looking for something in it's range.  fuel efficiency is high, it's 1.8L german 4 cylinder with the lighty body equates to great fun.

the car is very easy to work on, everything is simple and repair manuals for it (some better than others) are readily available, a great car for the budding mechanic.

the overal design of the car is great, simplistic and very functional with alot of german flavor.
