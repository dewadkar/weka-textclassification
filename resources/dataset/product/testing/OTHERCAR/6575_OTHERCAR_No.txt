            The '95 Oldsmobile Eighty Eight has some major design flaws.  It only has one cup holder in the front seat and the entire car is very unreliable.  Since I bought the car in '95 i have taken it in to be repaired on over twenty seperate occations, each for somthing broken.  It is usually the doors, the auto-locking mechanism on the doors often break forcing one to lock and un-lock one of the doors by hand each time they enter or exit the car.  The CD player has broken twice in a two year span.  Both times a CD got stuck in the player and had to be taken apart to be fixed.  The electrical system is poorly designed as well.  Once I was plesantly suprised to discover that my headlights were not functioning and the dash lights and the other interior lights always intermitintly dim and brighten for no apparent reason.
    However, the 88 is not with out it's benefits, It is wide and heavy so you can rule the road, it is fairly safe and with a V6 engine, it really can burn.
     If you want a nostalgic car that could betray you at any second then I reccomend this one.
