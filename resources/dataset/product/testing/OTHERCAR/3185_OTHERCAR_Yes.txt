            The Spider is a truly great car. Great Looks! Italian Fashion! Sporty Frame ! Nice Engine! Decent Interior! and the sound of an Euopean Sports car. I truly love this car, its handling, its design and the sporty quality possesed by this Italian beauty. It has a very nice sounding engine, a nicely equiped interior and looks to die for. Though I have only test driven this vehicle and druled over its design in the show room, this is truly a great car. It has a mediocre engine with remarkable pick up for a car of its size, far better than the Miata, though its engine size and strength does not compete with some other higher priced sports cars, it does have a smoother engine noise than the roar of some ggerman engineered sports cars. As Alfa Spiders of years past have done, this spider is no different it is on the cutting edge of style I have continued to consider purchasing this or a previous model, but truly am not convinced by its preacticality, so if you need a sporty car and want to stand out and be different, while grasping your share (or the cars share) or head cocks as you drive buy, go ahead and splurge. Enjoy and be Merry at least test drive the Spider.<br><br>
