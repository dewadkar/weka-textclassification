            I drive a 1999 Acura Integra four door sedan.  I bought this vehicle for its sporty looks and opinions from associates at work who own one.

The best part of this car is its handling.  I have the 140 hp version which is not bad as far as horsepower per weight of the car.  The sportier version packs more power but I knew this when I purchased this car since I need the four door version with a wife and daughter.  The car is manufactured flawless outside and inside.  The paint is dark green metallic and also is flawless.  The interior is tan cloth and the interior is also put together perfectly as far as any flaws.  The car has a sunroof and CD player and is basically loaded except for leather.

To take this car out on the road when I test drove it was exceptional with the handling.  I comes with Michelin XV4 tires and alloy wheels and cornering in this car was and is something else.  It really is a fun car to drive and comfortable.  The stereo is very good and dash is functional to all controls.

This is a great car for young people and older folks (like myself).  It is just a fun car to drive.<br><br>
