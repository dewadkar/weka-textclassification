            In July of 1998 I was assigned a brand new Chevrolet Astro mini-van to drive.  My work has me driving from one end of Michigan to another each and every week.  I turned 70,000 miles on the odometer this past week and felt it time to share my experience with this vehicle.

My first impression of this van was �..boring!  I was right, this van is not a fun vehicle to drive.  What this van is, if nothing else, is extremely dependable.  In the two an one half years I have been using this van, the only service that has been necessary has been the regular oil changes.  The only squeaks and rattles that have been noticeable to this point have come from add-on features my company have included.  Chevrolet has appeared to take the time to build a solid dependable truck especially designed for commercial use.

The six-cylinder 4.3 liter engine will definitely not break any records at Daytona but I have logged many expressway miles and have found the 190 horsepower engine is ample for any stretch of road.  The handling of this vehicle is, as one may expect, a bit soft.  Living in Michigan, it has driven in some pretty horrible weather and fares well on both ice and snow despite the stories I had been told of how bad these handle in poor conditions.  If anything causes the driver a problem, it would be wind, not snow.  The tall height of the van makes it a bit of a tussle with the steering wheel when driving through high winds.  The manufacturer rates this vehicle at 16 MPG in the city and 21 MPG on the highway.  These figures are very optimistic, as my vehicle falls several miles short of this estimate with the automatic transmission.

The instrument panel cluster is simple but does offer the driver a clear view of the gauges and lights.  All the knobs and controls are within a reasonable distance to the driver so one can safely keep their attention on the road should the need arise to adjust a control while driving.  The configuration of my van has a large window over the sliding door on the passenger side and two small windows in the rear.  This window configuration, along with the large side-view mirrors all but eliminate any blind spots I was concerned may have been a problem when I first sat in the vehicle.  The rear compartment contains ample space for many commercial uses.  My business forces me to carry large amounts of tools, test equipment and spare parts, all of which fit easily in the back of this vehicle.  It also offers additional height over some other mini-vans by other manufacturers should that be a need.

My main complaint with the Astro van is one that I believe you can avoid if one comes available for purchase, or should you purchase a new 2001.  If  you are only driving for short distances than this may not apply, but in my case the company purchased a van with stationary seating.  One-size-fits-all just will not make it for long haul driving.  I recently returned from a seven hour trip to the upper peninsula of the state and decided to write this Epinion so others may be aware that a few dollars would be well spent if a adjustable seat is offered on these models.

I did not purchase this van as it is company owned, but the Manufacturer�s page lists the list price at $19,000.  I was just a bit surprised, as I would have guessed a thousand or two less due to the fact that you are buying a van shell with two seats.  Yet I would still say that based on it�s dependability, it still is a good buy, especially for commercial users who are hard on their trucks.
