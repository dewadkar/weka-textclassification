            While I plan to upgrade to the newest sony mavica family. I cant say enough about this camera... When I first bought it, everyone said what a waste of money! &lt;br&gt;We bought the Sony Mavica 71 and have taken some wonderful photos. Living in Alaska, we have wonderful sunsets, some amazing scenery, beautiful bald eagles, black bears and other wildlife. I havent missed a shot yet.&lt;br&gt;The only thing Id like to see is some extra lenses, so Id have a better zoom (although this one does a excellent job, it would be nice for some options) and filters. &lt;br&gt;Since buying this camera both my mom and mother in law have borrowed it often and now agree it was money well spent!<br><br>
