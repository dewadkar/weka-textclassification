            Bought new to use for work (home health care) and pleasure! Previously had a 1989 Excel-sold in 91 -had problems with quite a few things.  Due to the price and my financial situation I found HYUNDAI to be the best option.  When I showed up at the house with the 95 Accent- my significant other and MOST everyone else were LESS than supportive about my choice!
Since my purchase MY ACCENT PROVED THEM ALL WRONG!   
Replaced console due to broken latch/clasp(covered/warr.) and just recently @ 92,000 miles for a loose bolt on the alternator mount.
I get inquiries from passersby while shopping, from patient's and families -even at fast food drive throughs.
Other's that have driven it  also think it's great-(One is 6'2&quot;)he even fits in the back seat!  He is the one that was (4.5 yrs ago)so against my buying it in the first place!  Now a definite supporter of Hyundai and is encouraging others.
Hyundai Motor Corp is very easy to work with and any questions or inquiries have always been handled quickly and efficiently.
Resale isn't much but then-neither was original cost!  Mileage great-kinda lightweight in Santa Ana Winds-(just keep tank full!)Handles well-it's a big part of my life.  Love it's exterior style.  Front end reminded me of a fish for some reason so I dubbed it &quot;The Guppie&quot;-hence my e-mail name.
Who knew that a few years later-it's spinoff sporty model (the &quot;Tiburon&quot;) would turn out to be a Shark?
Take care of it-do reg maint.-TLC- buy it a Hyundai Bra (if you are on the freeway a lot), and you'll have a dependable,low maintenance, efficient gas mileage means of transportation-while not sacrificing looks and style.
Wish they sold trucks in US!
Next purchase-if ever need one-HYUNDAI
