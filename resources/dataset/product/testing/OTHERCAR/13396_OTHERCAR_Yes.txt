            I am a large person so I need a car that was not only comfortable for me but could also seat 5 full sized adults in comfort.
I love the interior of this Town Car, it's quiet and the seats (heated, which is nice in New England) have more adjustments than my chiropractor!
The handling has improved over the 'older style classics' which ended in 1997.
The 1998 was a great leap forward for the Town Car and the 2001 while keeping the look of the redesign of 1998 is a better vehicle yet.
The horse power has improved just adding to the smoothness of the 4.6L V8.
This engine just feels perfect.  The astounding thing is when I set the cruise control at 62 or so I average an incredible 26.7 mpg!!  
The Watts linkage adds to the stability of the car, but there is still some float and the steer is to light.
While it's certainly not a European Sports sedan, a sports sedan isn't what I wanted.  I wanted a comfortable, full sized sedan that delivered reasonable gas mileage and haul full sized adults....I got that with my Town Car.
Things I would change:  I would add &quot;stabilatrax&quot; and 17&quot; wheels and I would add some inches to the moon roof, it's a very small for a such a big sedan.
If you want a full sized, extremely comfortable, easy rider, that delivers great fuel economy for a V8 then this is the car for you.
If you want to race around the express way, feel the bumps in the road, and rent a van when you have to room for 6 adults, then by a something else.
There are significant discounts available and low financing in some areas...and remember the 4 year 50,000 warranty makes a 1 year old Town Car with low mileage a great buy.
