            I have always had this thing against Jaguars, until my uncle bought one.  I still thought that it wasn't the sharpest looking car, but I gave it a chance for the only reason of that it was black.  One day he asked if I wanted to drive it around, so I took him up on the offer.  The car was unbelievable.  I have never drivin such a nice car.  The ride was so smooth you could not even tell that the car was moving.  We were going like 60 mile per hour and it felt like we were going so slow.  The jag is very roomy and very comfortable for trips.  The gas mileage is great and everything runs smooth and good.  The stereo system that it came with was so clear and sharp.  He didn't have to get a new stereo or speakers to make the quality sound better.  It was like he had redone the whole system.  Well I would recommend these jags to everyone, now that I have truely experienced what everyone was saying about them.  The ride was smooth, great stereo, great gas mileage and overall just a great car.<br><br>
