            Two weeks ago, my roommate replaced her ailing 1995 Mazda 626 with a '97  Toyota Rav-4.   After more than 1,000 miles, I can say that, overall, I am impressed by Toyota's freshman foray into the small sports-ute market.  

<b>Exterior</b>
The Toyota is at the top of its class in exterior styling...its angles and curves are more dynamic than the Honda CR-V's, more upscale than corporate twins Chevy Tracker and Suzuki Sidekick.  The plastic cladding on the lower body lends a two-tone appearance while protecting the painted portions of the RAV-4 from scratches and grime.  I am always wary of dark colored cars because they seem to be so difficult to keep clean, but the burgundy-painted portions of her RAV-4 ride high enough off the road that it retains its car wash sparkle for at least a week.  

The thick, sixteen inch factory alloys give the Toyota a solid, muscular appearance while also helping it stick to the road better than most SUVs I have driven.  And the one-piece swinging rear door makes loading a snap.

<b>Interior</b>
The interior gets average marks from me.  The woven upholstery is durable and attractive, the seats seem at first to be a bit firm, but prove to be comfortable on even longer drives.  

The dash layout could be improved...the Tic-Tac sized radio controls take some getting used to, and the climate control levers are a bit low-buck...but everything is an easy reach for both driver and front passenger.  

Front seat passengers have plenty of room...headroom is great, even with the reduction caused by the factory moonroof.  The driving position is comfortable--with the steering wheel right where it should be.  The rear seat is a bit cramped--taller passengers will wish for more room between seats, but the vertical drop offered by this tall vehicle make up for it somewhat.  

The biggest complaint I have of the interior is the lack of armrests.  Toyota should have at least put an upholstered console between the front seats (one is available as accessory.)  The front doors have what might be considered an armrest, but they are so thin that they are really only practical as an assist in closing the doors.  

<b>Safety</b>
Equipped with steel side door beams, dual airbags, and the optional anti-lock brakes, the RAV-4 I am familiar with would seem to protect its occupants well.  Vehicles in this class have traditionally <b>not</b> performed well in crash tests, so lets hope we never find out.  The lack of a rear bumper means that rear-end impacts will result in expensive repairs (a rear bumper is also available as an accessory, but it is more for looks than protection.)  
    <b>Update</b>
     Unfortunately, just a few months after buying the RAV it's safety was put to the test.  In a broadside blow, the passenger side caved in, crushing the dashboard and passenger seat.  Luckily, there was no one on the passenger side.  Overall, the RAV performed well, but I was a bit surprised at how much intrusion there was into the cabin.

<b>Performance and Handling</b>
The most remarkable trait of the RAV-4 is its handling.  All SUVs that I have driven previously have an unsure feeling in cornering, as if they might fall over. (Given the tendency of sports-utes to rollover, this actually is a concern)  But the RAV-4 is almost as nimble in turns as most non-sports cars.  While the ride is not as smooth as a cars, I find this desirable--my view is that if you want something that rides like a car, then you should buy a car.  

The two liter engine is fine for around town driving and highway cruising, but leaves much to be desired in acceleration and holding its speed on hills.  Putting the pedal to the proverbial metal will barely keep the RAV-4 at 70 mph on large highway grades. The RAV I drive is equipped with automatic transmission--I would expect the engine to perform better coupled with the manual, but with any transmission the RAV's engine is too weak.

The large wheel/tire package that makes the Toyota look so solid also makes it feel solid...last night I drove through water that would send most small cars into hydroplane like I was driving over a spilled drink.  
The all wheel drive will hopefully get us through the winter without trouble.  Another downside to the RAV is its gas mileage, around 20 mpg in a combination of town and highway driving.  With a smallish tank, the RAVs cruising range hovers around 250 miles.  

<b>Overall</b>
The RAV is a bit more expensive than its competition...the 1997 I am reviewing stickered new for over $24,000.  But the resale value is high, book value for the same car now (with 36,000 miles) is between 16 and 18 thousand depending on which guide you consult.  

With a more powerful engine and greater attention to ergonomics (both of which I hear have been addressed in the all-new RAV that comes out mid-September) I would have no complaints.  But Toyota provides a solid overall package...predicted reliability is high, as is resale value.  There is plenty of cargo room in the cabin--supplemented by the factory roof rack.  I think the RAV would be a perfect choice for young buyers and small families.
