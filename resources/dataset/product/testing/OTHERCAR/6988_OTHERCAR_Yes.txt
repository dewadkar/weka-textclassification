            The Blazer is my first truck -- and my first American-made vehicle in more than a decade. My 1994 Chevy Blazer (4DR; 2WD; Vortec V6) was purchased used in 1996. It was immaculate -- and is still pretty much in the same condition, despite being driven an average of 60+ miles each day.
Although I trust Consumer Reports for most purchases, I wholeheartedly disagree with them in regards to the Blazer. While they rated the 1994 model as one to avoid, I would highly recommend this SUV to anyone looking to purchase a good used family hauler.
The five in our clan (3 little ones) fit comfortably in the Blazer, as does our luggage... or fishing rods... or groceries... or whatever. Our bi-annual 10+ hours trips to the Ohio valley are a breeze with the Blazer.
Safety was a priority in our decision to purchase an SUV. The 1994 Blazer is a solid, heavy vehicle -- without the danger of air bags. If you're into speed, the Vortec V6 develops good torque for a lot of get-up-and-go! Maintenance has been much lower than average in my opinion. We've had two parts fail (Map/O2 sensor &amp; alternator = $530.00 total). Other than those unscheduled maintenance trips; tires, oil and brakes are the only &quot;repairs&quot; affected on our Blazer. The only general complaints I would note are: a) the sloppy emergency braking -- which has just been corrected by GM (free at the dealer) b) low gas mileage (16-17MPG City) and c) the full-size spare inside the storage compartment squeaks on poor roads. 
In summary, after driving more than 60,000 miles in our 1994 Blazer, we enjoy it as much as day one.<br><br>
