            We purchased a Rodeo a couple years back.  It was a good SUV, did not seem to have to many problems.  The only thing that was a concern was that it would puff blue smoke in the mornings.  Recently one of my friends purchased the Passport.  It seems to be identical to the Rodeo except it does cost more and the insurance is higher.  The are pretty much the same SUV.  There is no sign of the blue smoke in the mornings (no it was no oil) but this problem might have been fixed on the Rodeo a year later or so.  So if you like the Passport go test drive a Rodeo before purchasing and you could save your self some money.<br><br>
