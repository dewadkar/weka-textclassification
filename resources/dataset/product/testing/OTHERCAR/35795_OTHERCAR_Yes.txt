            I recently became the proud owner of my very own Saturn SL1 after sharing one with my family since 1996. Alice is dark green and lovely, dependable, and nearly perfect for my needs.

The SL1 is a fairly spacious sedan, capable of carting four adults with no problems, five adults if everyone squeezes, and six hungry college students in a pinch. The front console where the shifter sits makes it nearly impossible for a third passenger up front. Anyway, that many people and your poor car starts to drag, I don't recommend driving this way for long at all.

Alice gets somewhere around 35-40 mpg, especially when making numerous trips from home to school and back again. Driving around town, the mileage goes down, but that's to be expected. I'm very proud of this car.

Recently, I learned that everything necessary to make a short film can fit within the SL1 and still have room for a passenger and driver. Three light kits, one large motion picture camera, several microphones, cables, electrical cords, a DAT, duct tape, gaffer's tape, and a slate will all fit with the seats down, if done carefully. There's even room to look out the rearview mirror. I'm very, very proud of this car.

It's very easy to go very quickly when taking Alice for a ride. She doesn't seem to be able to read speed limit signs, and driving 75 feels very much like driving 50, so one must be careful. I certainly plan to recommend this car to others...see you at the Saturn picnics!<br><br>
