            I was 23 years old when I bought my red 1994 Dodge Viper RT-10 and the smile hasn't left my face since.  It's the type of car that when you park, as you walk away you look back and think &quot;is that really my car?&quot; or &quot;nothing can be this wildly beautiful!&quot;.  Owning a Viper is unlike owning any other car.  Strangers stop and stare, honk their horns, take pictures, women proposition you (I am male), cops follow you and your heartbeat never comes back down.  The power, sound and looks are absolutely ridiculous!!

Driving the car requires respect for the power that it possesses.  This car can not be thrown around the way less powerful sports cars (RX-7, Corvettes, Supra Turbo, etc.) can.  It is much less forgiving for driver transgressions and does not have ABS.  To get the most out of it (and to truly feel comfortable at the wheel), I suggest professional driving/racing lessons (as I intend to take).  

On the negative side, I have had to make several trips to the shop to get the car looked at/worked on.  The problem is that you need the dealership to have a Viper technician which limits your choices. Also, oil changes are expensive as it takes 10 qts of Mobil 1.

Overall, if you are looking for a car that's easy to drive to zip around town in, this is NOT it.  If you are looking for a beast that will intimidate you, challenge you, envelop you and blow you away, this is the ONLY one!
