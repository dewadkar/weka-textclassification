            I bought the Honda S2000 late last year. I basically fell in love with its looks first. But boy once you get in there for a test drive, no way i was even going to spend time test driving the BMW Z3 or the Porsche Boxster. It was a done deal the second the engine passed the 6000 r/min mark the first time i drove in it. 

I wanted a roadster and had considered the pros and cons that type of car had. So I am not going to elaborate on those, but the only thing I want to say is that the trunk of the Honda is pretty decent compared to some of its competitors. I never had any trouble shopping groceries and even my golf bag fits in it. No laying down the seats, no offering those friends a drive to the restaurant, no picking up a friend from the airport, ... a roadster comes at a cost, but it sure is worth it. I have seen people fitting bike racks to it, I have driven pretty big boxes home with the top off, so if you are really into roadsters, all those minor details should not hold you back. 

Now I am (still) really happy I made the purchase. It is a fantastic car for people like me that love pure sports cars and don't mind that the engineers worried about the engine, the brakes, the balance and stiffness rather than how the dashboard looks or whether the cup holder is in the right place. 
That really describes the Honda S2000 best: above all, it is a sports car, secondly is looks really cool and lastly, it is a Honda, so overall everything works and keeps working. 

Now the specifics: 
- the engine revs up to 9000. How the Honda engineers managed to get 241 HP into a 2 liter engine, I don't know, but between 6500 and 9000 revs they are all yours to play with. Awesome. The only times I have felt this type of power build-up was in turbo-charged cars or sport motorbikes. Needless to say that as long as you stay under 5000 rev, the Honda behaves like a really well mannered, but reactive car. Only when you you push it above 6000, those horses brake loose. Not exactly the flat power band that modern cars have, but if you want a race car, you get a race car. 
- handling is superb. Again, it has all a real sports car needs: make sure you have all the tools to control the car. The car will give you reliable feedback on every move it makes. If it brakes out in a turn, it will do that gradually and you can easily correct (but be careful with those 241 horses). Because of the sports tires and the sports suspension, it requires some caution to drive on slippery surfaces like wet roads. But again, if you are willing to handle it like a sports car, it will do whatever you want it to do. 
- the brakes are professional grade. Really these things brake like brakes should brake. Smooth, linear and most of all ... fast. Ok, the car is light so that helps, but still, they are amazing. Only side-effect: you tend to rely too much on them. The better option are those defensive driving principles of course. 
- the last outstanding thing about this car is that the body is really stiff. For convertibles this is rather unusual since the open construction takes away most of the frame support. Again excellent work from the Honda engineers. 

So, what is less glorious about this car? Actually everything else almost. Apart from it looks that are really great as well, this is a regular Honda. Not a bad thing, but how great the mechanics are, that is how everyday the rest is. It comes with a digital dashboard that makes you feel like you are racing on your play station. The seats are of course cup seats. The top comes of automatically and is pretty fast and easy to operate. 

Now what the Honda engineers should have caught before they let this one out of the factory is: 
- the plastic back window is crap. Plastic windows are always trouble, but this one is really bad. It in a few months it looses its transparency almost up to the point that you don't even bother looking in your rear view mirror. Honda replaces it, but that is just to keep you going of course. The 2002 model has this fixed I believe. Too bad they cannot retrofit the 2001 models. 
- the radio they planned to install must have been the wrong size or so and they decided to install the entry level model that comes with the Civic. Although nothing is wrong with the sound system itself, you would expect somewhat more power in a car that you want to drive with the top off. The radio looses the battle with the wind once you get onto highway speed.
