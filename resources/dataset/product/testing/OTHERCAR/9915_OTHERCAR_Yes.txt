            Let me start by saying that I live in Florida - a convertible owner's dream... you can drive with the top down most of the year here since our winters tend to be so mild.

My first convertible was a '94 Chrysler LeBaron purchased used in '95. I loved this car until it rained (which is extremely common here during the summer)... this car leaked like a sieve! The leaking was so unbearable that I owned the car for less than a year before I sold it (it ALWAYS) smelled like mildew!) I hate to say it, but this car soured me on convertible ownership for quite some time.

Anyway, on with my review... last year I had the bug for a new car... I'd been driving an old Honda Accord and was ready for something much more sporty. It was Fall when I got the bug - perfect convertible weather... when I finally figured out what type of car I really wanted, I realized it was none other than the mighty <b><i>Mazda Miata (MX-5)</i></b>! My search was on!

When I found her, it was a great day... her owner was selling only because he was in the military and was transferring to Germany. Because he was anxious to sell, I got a fantastic deal on my new baby! She's black with a tan top and tan leather. Although she'd been worn, she still looked pretty good for her age and she ran like a dream. Although I swore I'd never drive a 5-speed again (traffic is just too bad here), I couldn't imagine owning a Miata without it.

This car is so quick for being a small 4-cylinder. It's rear wheel drive and handles corners like a champ. I've owned my baby for a year now and have had no problems with her at all except my power antenna quit working.

If you're looking at getting one, here's some tips:
&lt;li&gt;Make sure the tires are good - it gets real squirly in the rain with balding tires
&lt;li&gt;It's trunk is teeny tiny so don't plan on hauling much (I have to use both the trunk AND the passenger seat for grocery shopping!)
&lt;li&gt;It could use some additional interior lighting (there is NO trunk light whatsoever so I'd make this your first purchase if you plan on needing to get into and out of the trunk in the dark)... you can find TONS of Miata upgrades &amp; accessories online
&lt;li&gt;I think these cars have a button somewhere that makes you invisible to other drivers (sure wish I could find that stupid button!) so you may need to be more aware of your surroundings than in your SUV.
&lt;li&gt;If you need a new top, the glass windows, while nicer than the plastic ones, do not fold down quite right in this year of car and take up some much needed storage space on the rear deck when folded down, as you can't set anything on top of the glass. I think I'd go with the &quot;standard&quot; window top if I had to replace mine

While I believe that the newer models have addressed the majority of these problems, $24,000 is a pretty steep price tag. If you're looking for something sporty and tons of fun with a much smaller price tag, I'd definitely recommend the older models. I picked mine up for about $6,000 a year ago and can easily say it's the best car purchase I've ever made. When I'm having a stressful day, I put the top down, crank the music as loud as I can stand it and just drive... before I know it, I've forgotten why I was stressing to begin with.
