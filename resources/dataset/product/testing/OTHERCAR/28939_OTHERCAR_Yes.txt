            I affectionately call my little 323 " the MAZDA_RATI..it's a cool little car and holds one of the most reliable engines ever built.  A couple months back I bought this when my girlfriend and I traded in our one car so we could each get a reliable vehicle that would be economical and good in the snow.  For $2000, and only 79K..I feel I got alot of car and it should last a long time. It's the 1993 323 with the 1.6 liter fuel injected engine. The car was like new and runs like new curently. I went outside 2 weeks ago in 0 degree weather with the wind-chill and she turned over three times and fired right up.  It does that every time I need to go somewhere.  I love the rack and pinion steering that some Euro sports cars have...handles like a porsche.  This car has a great feel behind the wheel and had alot of torque from 1st to 3rd gear.  You will definitely take off if you need to.  I had my first run in the snow with it last week.  Got caught in a terrible snowstorm on I87 going north in upper N.Y.  To my delight the 323 hugged the road and barely slipped at all except when applying to much gas in first gear! One thing I noticed about these Japanese front wheel cars is they grip the road in snow and have heaters to die for! I honestly don't have any complaints worth warning you about.  I tend to drive with my headlights on in daylight as some people fail to see me coming and pull right out in front of me.  I dont know if that is because the car is small, or the color white!?

Positives:
$10.50 to fill the tank
handles great
reliable as hell
fun to drive
get looks from people because car is unique
roomy front
A/C on base model
hatchback with folding down seat
quick (speedometer has top speed of 130)
sporty
inexspensive to insure

Negatives:
Wish tires were "14 instead of "13
door locks and doors freezing in cold weather
that's it.

If you're not concerned with having to own the trendy vehicles..this is a great reliable peppy little car with the "ENGINE THAT WILL"
