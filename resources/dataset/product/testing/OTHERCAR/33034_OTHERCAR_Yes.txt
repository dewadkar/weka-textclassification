            I traded my 95 Formula Firebird off on the 98 Dodge SST because it was more practical.  Since I was living on the farm I was finding myself parking the car and driving another vehicle for gravel roads and winter.

For some people the big flashy racing stripes are little to much, but I found that they grow on you.  You can't go anywhere with this truck without turning heads.

The truck has the 5.9L V8 with an automatic transmission (sorry Dodge doesn't make the 5.9L with a standard) and 3.55 gears.  The truck makes about 260hp after adding some add ons.  After adding a K&amp;N filtercharger and bosh platinum quad plugs I'm getting 20 mpg on the highway at 70 mph and average 16 mpg in the city.  You can sure shock a lot of guys when you pull up to a light and blow a 5.0L mustang away.

The truck has great visibility and handles amazingly well for a truck (especially coming from a sports car).  The seats become a little uncomfortable after a few hours but other then that the ride is really good. 

After putting 72,000O kms on the truck I haven't had any problems except for a bearing that went in the rear end (covered under warranty).  One thing to note is if you live in a cold climate the sensor for the over drive might have to be repositioned closer to the engine.  This makes it possible to shift into overdrive when it gets  to -35oC.<br><br>
