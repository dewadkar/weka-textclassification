            I originally bought a Dodge Stratus (used) because I needed a car, and needed a car fast after I totaled my previous car. However, after having bought it, and driving it for a year, I would tell anyone who was thinking of buying one to go ahead and get it, regardless of the year. 

I had no problems with this car up until I got in a front-end collision, and even after that, the body held up great and it was repaired.

There is plenty of leg and body room and a large back seat that is great for baby or child seats.

I did have transmission problems, it literally fell into pieces, and I do not know if that was manufacturing problems, or my own fault. However, I put a brand new transmission and radiator in it, and a week later bought anew car after it stalled out on me a few times. I eventually had a lot of problems with the car, but I believe that to be because of the front-end collision I had in it, not due to the structural or mechanical integrity of the car being poor to begin with. 

I also took into account that I drove this care close to 200 miles every day for a year, so even for the faults I had with the car, I would still recommend it as a good buy to anyone.
