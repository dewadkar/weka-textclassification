            What can say, this is a beautiful car.  The exterior styling is graceful yet powerful.  I bought the EX 4cylinder model because I prefer to drive manuals over automatics.  With the reduction in weight compared to its v6 counterpart, this car when loaded with a manual tranny hauls ass.  Add a spoiler and you have the coolest thing on the road.  Well not really, but it's pretty close.  Only thing I don't like is the CD headunit.  The buttons are too big and its size makes it look funny when you install a third-party headunit.

My first car was an 88 Accord Coupe with a manual tranny.  Was still running great at over 200K miles when I traded her in.  Only work done was a new transmission and the usual breaks and oil jobs.  Who knows how far this one will take me.  Been over year and I only have 13K on her, I'm gonna die before this car disappears from my garage.<br><br>
