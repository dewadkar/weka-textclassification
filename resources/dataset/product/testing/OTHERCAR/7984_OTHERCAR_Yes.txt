            I bought this camera on my honeymoon in St. Thomas last May 2003.  Before doing so I had looked at many cameras and did a thorough amount of research.  There were several things I was judging my perspective cameras on. 
1)	Will the camera take high quality 8X10 photos? 
2)	Will the camera accept filters for polarizing or macro lenses? 
3)	Does the camera take normal easy to find and replace batteries (as opposed to a special battery pack)?  
4)	What kind of storage media does the camera take and how expensive is it?  
5)	Price and functionality.  
The Minolta Dimage s414 is a 4 MP camera. Being so it takes wonderful (at least or better quality of 35mm film) 8X10 shots.  I have taken almost 1000 pictures with this camera of things ranging from people to close ups of flowers to nighttime fireworks at 4 sec exposure. Beautiful!  For Christmas my wife purchased for me a UV, Polarizing, and Macro lenses (35.5MM) filters for my camera.  I can't wait to try them.  Because it is a digital camera, I believe that theses are the only filters I will EVER need to have for this camera since most other adjustments can be done with software.  The Minolta Dimage s414 takes 4 AA batteries.  I keep a set on the charger and 2 sets in my bag.  They will take a good 60 photos on one set depending on the settings of the camera.  It takes flashcard media which is very easy to find and relatively cheap.  I simply download the cards contents onto my PC when it is full.  A 256 MB card can hold over 300 photos depending on the camera settings.  The camera comes with 4X optical zoom and 2.2X digital zoom, which is sufficient for this type of camera.  The only drawback to the camera is the digital zoom, which I find to be grainy so I leave it off.  I would say though that I find the digital zoom to be grainy in most other cameras also.  I purchased a Card reader, bag, 128MB card, the camera and rechargeable batteries in the islands for $400, I consider this a deal because at the time the camera itself was retailing for that much alone in the states.  The only other thing that I noticed with my camera was a slight malfunction of the LCD screen when it overheated from extended use (45 min or more). The screen will turn from color to black and white however this doesn&#146t seem to affect the actual image being recorded.  Another feature that you will not find on other cameras is that besides the fully automatic &#147point and click camera&#148 you also get a fully manual mode where you can control everything from focus to aperture to shutter speed and everything in between.  My dad has a Canon SLR he purchased that was the top of the line 15 years ago.  Except for the option to attach lenses, this camera is just as functional.  I recommend this to anyone who loves photography but isn&#146t ready to shell out $1000+ for a professional camera.  I would buy again.  Best of all, I will never have to pay for film and developing again&#133
