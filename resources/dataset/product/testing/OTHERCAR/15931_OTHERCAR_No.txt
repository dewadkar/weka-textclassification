            I bought on of these cavaliers for my mom since her 74 buick broke down. Its interior was ok and it seemed to be a good car. I not being rich decided that a cavalier would be cheap yet nice gift. I purchased the top of the line one with spoiler , sun roof and the whole bit. My mom thought it was kinda ugly(isn't she so sweet) but hey she's a little old and I thought the front was cute the back kinda ugly but it didn't matter it was transportation. My mom took the car to california to visit my brother (400 miles from here) and it broke down. She eventually got it towed to the nearest chevy dealer where they took 3 days to tell us the block thingy was runied and we will get a new engine installed. I was actually thinking wow a new engine that mean's it will run like new. Then I realized that the original engine only had 700 miles on it. After another week we got the car back and it ran ok but I notice blue smoke or steam coming from the back pipe thing we took it to the dealer and the dealer said they must have not rebuilt the engine right. I told them the other dealer said they put in a new engine so they checked and it was a brand new engine according to the number thing on it. So this time I told them I wanted a refund on the whole car and when I threatened to get a lawyer they did give it to me. I then went out and bought a hundyia accent for my mom for even cheaper. So far its been the perfect little car but it has only 1,200 miles so far but it also has a 10 times longer warranty 10 year 100,000 miles. I don't know much about cars but I have noticed american cars are not as good as japanese or german cars anymore.
