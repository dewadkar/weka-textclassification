            Details Body: The DX3600 is a wonderful indoor camera...

Really good stuff in here. 2.2 megapixels meaning your friends will be amazed by the pictures.  Way better than putting a photo on your scanner.

Great value per dollar.  My friends who bought cameras costing twice as much sulked when they saw my photos, so the value is the big advantage.

In other words, you can beat the camera quality, but it will cost a lot more to do it.

The camera comes with 8M memory, so at least you can take a couple of photos with it (at high res.)

You can mix low and high res photos on the same memory card/camera.

The camera can be used as a video camera and record movies!
(If the specs didn't mention it)

Has a patch cord to record the movies on the VCR, invest a bit on a memory card, (a nice big one) and I suspect you can get almost 20 minutes on a highest res movie.  Very cheap for a little video camera!

Nice LCD preview screen (if you can see it, see below)

Has tripod mount

Built in flash.

USB transfer is nice.

Built in XP (and the included software, treats the camera as a disk drive, so you can edit photos with whatever you want, well, like a disk drive) support.  I didn't install the Kodak software on XP since I didn't care about the software for editing pictures from Kodak.

(Add on memory cards are very cheap, BTW)

What isn't fun:

The LCD screen is GONE in daylight.  You want to use it in daylight?  Pictures, look as nice, but LCD preview? No.

The viewfinder does NOT frame the pictures well, so no longer can you line up the pictures well (in daylight).

The dock really adds to the function, but I resent having to buy it to get the recharge batteries and dock connectors.  You need the dock so you don't wear out the camera mini-USB connector (break a pin, lose a camera)
