            We own a 1995 Saturn SL2 45, which is driven primarily by my husband. I avoid driving it if at all possible, because I prefer an automatic transmission. I also would prefer a larger car to ride in, but this one has many good points.

In 1995, my husband did a lot of research before he bought this car...actually, before he even drove one. He read about a lot of other cars, looked at a lot of cars, and chose this one based on his belief that Saturn was making quality cars that would last. And, oh, yes, it gets great gas mileage. Even after six years and almost 140,000 miles, he averages about 30 miles per gallon of gas. 

We have had minimum repairs done on this car and it still drives well. In fact, we plan to drive it on a 300 mile trip to Myrtle Beach next month.

This car should not be purchased by people like me who want a large car with large trunks and automatic transmissions. (The car, of course comes with an option of automatic transmission.) But it is a great car for one or two people who plan to drive it a lot and want to keep a car a long time.
