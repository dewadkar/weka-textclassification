            The Lincoln Town is the most reliable car I have ever heard of. In eleven years of driving it I have yet to have even one difficulty. It rides like a dream. It is quiet with a wonderful livingroom like interior. It as much a pleasure to ride in the front as the back. On the downsides it is not very fuel efficient 17/24 and has little acceleration for a v8. Of course a person buying this car should not be interested in drag racing, but the car accelerates quickly enough to be completely safe when merging. The car is beautiful and makes a great impression. I have had over 40 people tell me what a beautiful car I had and many have asked to use it on dates. Which reminds me it has a big back seat, oh yeah, I already mentioned that. In all seriousness, unless you are a drag racer, you will be happy you purchased this vehicle. <br><br>
