            I bought this car in august and have since put on over 7000km, and I have yet to have any major problems with it.

However when I bought it the front bushing needed replacement due to a slight squeaking. This cost nothing and was repaired very quickly. 

Mine is the 5 Speed manual coupe, which I specifically asked for. I test drove all the cars in its class and it impressed me on acceleration the most. I am not sure on how the automatic transitions are, but the 5 speed they include is great. It is made in Germany. I have 0-60 in about 7 seconds, that&#146s one second faster then the civic. 

I took it on a 2000 km trip with my friend, 3 guitars and a full trunk of luggage and never had any problems passing.
When you drop it down from 5th to 4th or even if your into it 3rd, it really goes.

Also I get great gas mileage.

This car is great for younger people.  
However for older people I would recommend a Intrepid.
Coupes are not really great for old people. 

I am sad to see so many people give this car a bad rep after trying RENTAL CARS. Try the gm 24 hour test drive and try a new one first.

Also the sale man sent me a free dinner at a expensive restaurant for me and a friend after i bought it, and they have been following up regularly.

They even change fluids rotate tires and such for free.
And if you run out of gas, they bring you more under their free service plan. :-P    

For the warranty in Canada you get 3 year bumper to bumper. Everything but brakes, tires, and clutch. And 5 year power train.
