            I bought my Prism used in 1997 and it has been a good, reliable car with few problems. I bought it with only 60,000 miles on it and had heard that the engine was manufactured my Toyota (which I trust and love) however the rest of the car was made by Chevrolet (do not trust so much or like!). But the price was right about $5000 and I could not afford a foreign car. I did a lot of research in Consumer Reports and I believe in them completely. They gave the car a good recommendation in all areas except &quot;hardware&quot; Well so what I thought that is not so important, right? Since then my inside door handle broke off when my passenger opened it, the plastic grate in the vent disentigrated, the lock in the trunk sticks, the fabric on the inside of the roof is coming off, the window does not roll up properly and it leaks water, the rubber weather stripping stuff is always falling off.....anyway, I love the inside of my car I'm just afraid I might be driving down the highway and the whole frame will just fall off. It's the little things...<br><br>
