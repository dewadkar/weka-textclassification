                After 2 1/2 years of aggravation, the EVIL car is gone! I bought the car new in Germany and I paid too much for it. I thought it would be a wise investment after 3 used cars that had countless repair bills. I was not prepared for the depreciation, the headaches, the backaches and the problems.
    I will say that, for the first year, it was a reliable car other than the brakes SQUEAKED whenever it had rained or when I applied them at a low speed. I had them checked and there was nothing &quot;wrong&quot; with them. 
    I am 5'2&quot; and was a little cramped, my husband is almost 6' and barely fit with the seat all the way back. The trunk wouldn't fit all my groceries because the trunk hinges that got in the way.
    The GAS mileage was horrible to start with and got worse. Then the gas gage STOPPED working last December and I ran out of gas on the interstate. I took it to the mechanic and he unclogged my fuel lines and injectors. Two weeks later, it wouldn't start and the engine light came on. I got the light to go out, but the gas gage would never go below 1/2 tank, even when it was almost empty. Thank goodness the trip odometer still worked!
    I always had the oil changed no more than 3500 miles apart. But when I noticed a horrible smell coming from the engine, and a puddle under the car, I found out there was oil in the spark plugs. After I replaced them, the smell disappeared in a few weeks.    
     After 15 months the speakers went dead. I would be driving and the stereo would go out for no apparent reason. The NEW speakers I had put in worked for about 6 weeks. Then it started all over again. That's when I realized how LOUD the engine was. It made me sick to listen to it. I also had to start shifting into second to get up small hills.
     The final straw came when my driver's side door handle BROKE inside somewhere and I had to roll down my window to get out. Of course, it wasn't the inexpensive clip that broke, it was the $89 handle.       
     Two days ago, I finally found a dealership that would give me more than 3000 dollars for it. They got rid of a beautiful 1999 Altima GXE that was a demo car, and they paid off the entire car. I feel SORRY for whoever buys it. My husband wanted me to look at the new model Neon, but I refused. I was raised to buy American, but Daddy will have to forgive me for this one.<br><br>
