            I am going to break my own rule and review a car I don't own.  This is because I have been driving this car for the last three weeks, as a rental, while my "real" car gets repaired from the wreck I was in.  There are enough problems with this car, I felt people should be warned.

About the only thing positive I can say about this car, is that it gets me from place it place.  It has good acceleration when entering the highway and gets up hills with no trouble.  The car is a 4-cylinder, 79 hp, for those who care about such things.  

The owner's manual claims 34 mpg for the automatic transmission version of the LSi, and I'm getting a little less than that.  But with only a 10.3 gallon tank, fill-ups are frequent (75 mile commute every day).

As far as space goes, the car is fairly roomy in the front seat, as long as your shorter than about five foot ten.  I think the back seat might actually have more space, though a taller person than me might shove the front seat back and intrude on the space.  The trunk is very spacious for this small of a car.  The seats are fairly comfortable, though not much room for adjustment.  Oh yes, it does have four doors, so getting stuff and people in and out of the back seat is easy.

Okay, here's the first problem.  Have you ever heard of manual steering?  Some of you younger epinionators probably don't know there is such a thing.  I didn't think there was on such a new car.  Yet this car has manual steering.  I thought the point of a small car was manueverability.  Yet that manueverability is greatly hampered by a steering wheel that takes a weight-lifter to turn.  Forget about driving with a coke or coffee cup in your hand.  You'll need both hands to crank that wheel.  Getting out of a parallel parking space?  Someone boxed me in the other day.  In my Escort it would've been no problem, but with this stupid manual steering I couldn't crank it tight it enough in the space.  I had to jockey it around.  Due to most people's lack of experience driving with manual steering this could really be a problem if you suddenly had to try to avoid an accident.

The second problem, related to the first, in terms of lack of safety--the rear of the car slopes up from the front.  This means that the visibility out the back is impacted.  There is less window space out of the sides and the rear to see approaching cars and your blind spot is bigger.  And in that situation where I was backing up--because the rear end slopes up, my view of the rear end of my car is obstructed, so I couldn't see exactly where I was in relationship to the car behind me.  Yes I could still use my rear view windows, but I've never been very good at that--I rely on looking.  It is the same problem in the front.  The front of the car slopes down so far, I couldn't see the front of the car while jockeying it around in the parking space either.  So I couldn't see how close I was to the car in front of me.  No mirror can help me with that.  Admittedly this isn't going to be as much of a problem for a taller person, though I'm not exactly short at five foot six or so.  But I feel strongly that this is a serious defect that could lead to real safety problems.

Here is another dumb thing.  We are all used to a gas gage with the "E" on the left and the "F" on the right, right?  Of course in this car, the gage is the opposite.  It is also vertical instead of horizontal.  If you don't look at it close you might think you have lots of gas left, when you are actually almost out.  Who knows what dark lonely street you might run out of gas on because you were unfamiliar with this type of gage.  I almost made the mistake myself in the first couple of days.  What a stupid design!

Okay, here is a minor annoyance.  There is nothing even remotely resembling a console, so there is nowhere to put that Coke you just bought at the drive-up window.  Try sticking it between your legs and not squeezing because you're going to need both hands to steer the car out of the parking lot.  There's also nowhere to throw my loose change, mailbox key, or any other small thing I might need, other than the floor.  

Another design flaw is the air conditioning.  First of all, its only useful if it isn't hotter than 80 degrees.  And at that temperature I don't really need it.  Today it was 95 degrees and it was woefully inadequate.  Only with the fan cranked up to the max did I get anything cool and even that wasn't much.  The other major problem is that the louvers on the panel are not capable of being pointed down.  They don't go any lower than shoulders.  Again with a taller person this wouldn't matter much.  But for me, the air is blowing in my face.  If my drive is very long, like out to work, this dries out my eyes.  It is uncomfortable and makes me sleepy.  Was anybody thinking when they designed this system?

The car does have both driver's side air bag and passenger side air bag, but no other safety features of note.  No power locks, no child proof locks.  And if they're so safety conscious, I still wonder why manufacturer's never give us more than that stupid "doughnut" tire for a spare.  There's something loose underneath the trunk area somewhere, maybe the jack stand, and it clinks and clanks around when I turn a corner.  Brother.  And did I mention the road noise?  Much noiser than my Escort.

Okay, I've done enough complaining.  I don't have any idea what this car costs, around $11,000, I'm guessing by the prices listed here.  But even at that you're paying too much.  Even if this is the "stripped down" model, I still feel the design of the car makes it unsafe, especially for vertically challenged (short) people.  

(Oh yeah, the speaker system is decent.  But still no cassette deck or CD player.)

UPDATE:  One more thing I forgot.  The horn consists of two tiny thumb-size buttons on the steering wheel.  For obvious reasons, I don't want to take my eyes off the road and look for those darn buttons.  Just another design shortfall.  On my Escort, the whole center of the wheel is the horn.  I can punch any part of it, to warn someone about to make a dangerous lane change or something.  In this stupid Metro, I will have already been hit.  Almost was, twice today, in fact, because this car is so short it can't be seen from some of these taller pickup trucks.  It took less time to just put on the brakes than honk.
