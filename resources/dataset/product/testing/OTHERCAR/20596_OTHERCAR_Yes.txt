            As a resident of Colorado, I needed a car that can handle the slushy spring snow in the day that turns into hardpacked ice at night.  As an outdoor mountain enthusiast, I needed a car to quickly and smoothly negotiate hairpin curves without sending the contents (and passengers) of the car flinging to the sides at every curve.  As an executive in a high-tech company, I needed a car that projects a smart image (okay, so I'm a little vain -- aren't we all?).  As a wife and mother of two kids and a dog, I needed a car that hauls those kids and groceries to/from school and all the activities that come with a husband, kids, and a dog.  

We could've bought four cars (yeah, right!), but the 2000 Audi A4 Avant (2.8L) is the perfect combination for all the things in our life.  We once drove sports cars (Porsche, 280z, Celica GTX, MGA) until the kids came along.  Then we moved into the SUV world (big, ugly, no-fun, gas-guzzlers).  My husband would've taken a bullet in the head before driving a mini-van, so from there we tried a station wagon (still no fun, but at least the gas mileage was better).  We were dying to get back into a sports car, even considered biting the bullet and buying a third car, until a friend recommended the Audi.  It was love-at-first-drive.  

The car was barely in the driveway 12 hours when we took it up to the mountains for a ski weekend.  The roads were icy.  We passed a few overturned SUVs.  The Quattro never once slipped, and it kept up a good speed.  The big 2.8L engine (with 5-speed) hardly broke a sweat as we climbed in elevation.  The cold weather package kept visibility clear.  We LOVE the heated seats!!  This car is MADE for the mountains!!

Other niceties:  The Bose stereo is fabulous.  The wood trim and leather seats are very posh.  I really enjoy blowing past other cars when the stoplight turns green!

On the downside:  The cupholders are really lame (others have commented on this).  The backseat is cramped for adults (but the kids have plenty of room).  The floormats show the slightest bit of dirt/mud, and do not clean up easily (but they do &quot;button&quot; down, which is a nice feature).  What's up with the rubbing-alcohol washer fluid?  My kids are ready to jump out the window every time I clean the windshield!  Speaking of my kids, they don't like the new-car smell (can't please everyone)!  Really, the negatives on this car are very petty when compared to the positives!

Overall, this is THE PERFECT sporty mountain car for a family of four.
