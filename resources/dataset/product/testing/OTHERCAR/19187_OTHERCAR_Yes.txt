            When I bought my Toyota Tercel, it was ten years old and had 112,000 miles on it. I bought it because I needed a cheap, used car and its price ($1,000 below its estimated worth -- $2500 -- because I bought it from a friend of the family) was irresistible. From what I can see, it gets about forty miles to the gallon. Although I've had to take it in for repairs a few times, it has definitely lived up to the Toyota name. For a ten-year-old car, it's been very good, especially considering the 3,000 miles I've put on it since I bought it.

I love the mileage--this is my second car, and my first was an '88 Ford Tempo. There is no comparison (the Tempo gets half the mileage of the Tercel). It drives pretty well; I feel as though I'm in control. My only problem is with its small size. I am five foot six and female, but I still have to push the driver's seat all the way back to feel comfortable. Still, once you get past that, it gets you where you want to go, and it can fit almost anywhere besides. This car would be good for college students (like me), people without a large family or perhaps a mini-van as well, and people who are looking to save money on gas, the environment, or both. The Tercel is definitely not good for you if you're into luxury, since &quot;economy&quot; is a word that I would most likely assign to it. If you're tall, it might not be the best idea because you'll end up with leg cramps.<br><br>
