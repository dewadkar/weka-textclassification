            <b>Great Car - 1993 Honda Accord LX</b>

Well I've had this car nine years now.  It was one year old with 18k miles on it when I bought it and now has 165k miles on it and still going.

<b>Car Features</b>
I have the LX model.  Standard with it are power windows and locks and painted bumpers compared to the lower priced DX model.  You also get a power radio antenna.  The EX model has a few other nicer trim pieces and a sunroof.
A/C is not a standard feature on Hondas made that year, but most of the LX and EX models have it installed (typically at the dealership before they are sold).

<b>Durability</b>
This is a well made car.   I've owned it for 9 years now and have had very little problems with it.  There is very little wear on the interior or exterior components.  I've been very pleased with how well it's held up.

<b>Gas Mileage</b>
Gas mileage is great on this car.  It typically ranges from about 25mpg in the city to 32mpg on road trips.  Best I've gotten is about 34mpg.  I commute to another city for work in it and tend to get about 30mpg overall during commute driving, which is a combination of city and highway travel.   This is pretty good considering that most of the highway travel speeds are at around 80mph.
Note this is with the 5-speed manual transmission.  I've been told the automatic gets slightly lower gas mileage.

<b>Drivin' it.....</b>
This is an easy car to drive.  The 2.2 liter engine gives great response and plenty of power to zip in and out of traffic.  Visibility is also very good in this car.  This is very important not to have "blind spots".  Two outside mirrors assist with this.   All of the drivers controls are easy to reach while driving.

<b>Systems</b>
The A/C, heat, power windows/locks, power steering/brakes, etc have all worked great.  I've had to replace the battery a couple times and the headlight bulbs also, but that's to be expected on a 10 year old car with 165,000 miles on it.

<b>What has broken while I've had it?</b>
I've had to do very little repair maintenance on this vehicle.  It's just been a very dependable car.

The first thing that went out was the power radio antenna.  The antenna still works for receiving radio signals, but it just won't power up and down like it once did.   Several other people I know had this same thing happen on their Honda.   
<b>Fix:</b>  Never fixed it since it still receives just find

The "brake light switch", which is located on the brake pedal, broke on me.  This caused all my brake lights to quit working.  
<b>Fix:</b> Replacement was about $60 at the local Honda dealer.

The heat-A/C temp knob seems to wear out about every 30,000-40,000 miles of driving.  It's plastic molded and just doesn't hold up well.  I don't think it's completely the fault of the knob though as I tend to 'slam' the knob all the way to the 'hot' or all the way to the 'cold'.
<b>Fix:</b> replacement knob at Honda dealership is about $3.  Last time I was there I bought two of them knowing the knob would just break again next year and this way I'd already have a replacement.   The Honda parts manager says he sells alot of those and they break alot.

At about 160,000 miles, my valve cover gasket started leaking/soaking a little oil through.  160,000 miles on a gasket is pretty good.  So this didn't bother me much.  
<b>Fix: </b> Replace gasket ($40 for gasket).  Good idea to
go ahead and replace spark plugs and spark plug gaskets also since they go through the valve cover.

<b>Things to look for if you are buying a used Honda </b>
These are great cars and if serviced right will last forever.   If you are looking at buying a used Honda, check to see that the oil was changed regularly.  Don't be scared to ask to see the service records.  Look for one where the oil was changed anywhere from 3,500 to 5,000 miles.

Also make sure the timing chain has been changed.  It's due to be changed every 90,000 miles.  Usually the water pump and maybe the fan belt were changed at the same time since they have to remove these during this service.

Depending on the transmission and mileage, you might want to check to see what if any transmission maintenance has been done, such as changing of lubricants.

<b>One other maintenance note:</b>
If you change out the brake pads, make sure to replace them with Honda brand brake pads.   If you don't the new brake pads, which put off more heat, will warp your Honda factory rotors.  This happened to me and other fellow Honda owners that I know.  I was told by some people to make sure I replaced them with Honda brake pads and I didn't do it and sure enough after time my Honda rotors warped, which gives you a 'bouncy feeling' when you brake.    So go ahead and get the Honda brand name pads (from the dealers parts counter) and you won't have to go to the expense of buying new rotors later.

<b>What will be next? </b>
Well, I expect to easily get 225,000 to 250,000 miles out of this engine.   If the rest of the car is in good shape then I'll most likely rebuild the engine when needed and keep going.  However if I do buy another one, my next car will most likely be another Honda or I might step up a little and get an Acura.

Would I buy another one just like it?  Heck yes!
