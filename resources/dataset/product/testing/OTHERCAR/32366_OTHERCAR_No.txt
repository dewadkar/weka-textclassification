            First off, I have a 1999 Lincoln Navigator with 70 thousand miles on it.  55 thousand of those miles are my miles as it was bought used (I am one of those kinds who firmly believes in buying used).

I am also single, mid 20&#146s and live downtown in Baltimore, Maryland, a city notorious for narrow streets and parking problems.

So now you have a baseline as I comment on owning this massive vehicle.  

I switched out from my Audi A4 3 to this truck three years ago as my family grew progressively in size for about a year.  Yes my family of beloved dogs.  At the peak, there were 12, all fosters, all over 60 pounds.  I wanted something big and had been debating for some time leaving the life of great gas mileage, zippy handling and nice throttle response but taking on the responsibility of fostering animals forced the switch.  I considered several of &#147the big bunch&#148 when test driving including the Excursion (ok, too big), Expedition, Tahoe, Toyota Landcruiser and Range Rover.  Since this review is about the Navigator and not any of those other vehicles, I&#146ll stick to the topic at hand.

The Navigator caught my eye immediately, pictures and ads don&#146t do it much justice.  Though it resembles the Expedition on outside appearance, there are a few obvious styling differences between the two, like chrome accents, classy grill and front end.  The interior is fantastic and offered the creature features I swore I wouldn&#146t let go of when I left Audi.  Granted most trucks in this price range offer the options drivers long for, Lincoln does it is a simple, effective manner.  I found all the controls to be well within reach, including the CD changer in the center console.  The glove box is a stretch and should not be accessed while driving (nothing much should ever distract the driver but some do regardless).  Multiple climate zones are especially effective in this truck, and rear passenger control takes most of the responsibility off the driver.  The leather is nice, but I&#146ve noticed quick wear on the driver seat.  The Navigator I purchased came with the Alpine 8 speaker stereo system equipped with a 6 Disc Changer and Subwoofer in the rear panel.  It is more than adequate and offers all the functions one would come to expect from Alpine quality.  I&#146ve found the seat heater button to be a nuisance when exiting and entering a running vehicle as the climbing in sometimes activates the system and you get unwanted warmth.

The seating configuration I chose after careful consideration was split rear seating with a center console (which now houses an entertainment center) and the rear bench which I removed on day one or ownership and haven&#146t put back in to date.  The third row bench just isn&#146t comfortable for adult seating and accessing the seating area from the rear entry is also difficult.  With the third row bench removed there is a ton of cargo space.  I use the dog measurement.  I can fit 6 dogs happily in this space (with 4 seats still empty).  I&#146ve even slept back in that space recently on a camping trip gone sour.  From the driver seat, the rear vent windows can be tilted open adding a nice airflow to the vehicle.  All this open space coupled with the roof rack and towing capacity make this a very comfortable, and able hauler, whether it be junk, people, animals, or just the security of knowing you have the space if you need it. 
The 99 Navigator boasts a 5.4 liter V8 which, while horsepower is not lacking, it is sadly not enough to really power this truck.  It is sluggish at times, and does not like inclines. I&#146ve replaced the exhaust to add some extra horsepower and it has helped but not as much as I would have likes.  You do have the burden of all wheel drive though so I&#146m not complaining about my lack of power.  In the 3 years that I&#146ve owned this truck, I can honestly say that I&#146ve been spoiled and have not experienced any fishtailing or steering oddities.  The all wheel drive system is just that effective.  The Navigator also makes life a little easier with and air ride suspension, which I must say, makes the ride and city life much better than most of the Navigator&#146s competitors.

So the bad?  Well there are a few sadly:  
Parking- sharpen your skills, even the most generous of spots can be tough.  

Cost- aside from the $40k price tag when I bought it, everything is more expensive: tires, tune-ups, oil changes.  

Service- I&#146ve been very unimpressed and annoyed with Lincoln/Mercury Service.  Though this might be a function of the particular dealership I go to, I&#146ve found more than one routine service visit to not solve a &#147simple&#148 problem on the first try or cause other problems in servicing my vehicle.  I&#146ve stopped taking it to them and most likely won&#146t repurchase a Lincoln solely based on that reason.  I feel like a dollar sign to them and not a valued customer.  

/addition to review

I've noticed in the comments section about my review a request for or advice to add information about driving this vehicle.  Pardon the omission, I debated about adding my particular driving habits and didn't, but now will.

My commute to work is a straight shot 30 mile each way drive on I95, and many of you know this is a stretch of road is heavily used and can prove challenging at times with the abundance of big rigs.  Combined with navigating (sorry, had to use it) the city streets of Baltimore I think I've managed to encounter many of the driving challenges one might face.  On the highway, at reasonable speeds there is little to no road noise provided your tires are properly balanced (found this out the hard way) and engine noise is at a minimal.  Since even at 65+ you're at low RPM, it seems Honda Civics make more noise than I do.  Punch the gas to pass that slow semi and as the transmission downshifts you'll then hear it.  I'm no speed demon but I have encountered a bit of chattering at speeds over 75, this in my opinion is expected from a vehicle made for torque not speed.  Taking the offramps is a pleasure compared to other trucks this size.  There is little wash out or wandering during tight steering of any kind and steering wheel response is comparable to smaller more nimble SUV's.  This may be in part due to the auto leveling air suspension and all wheel drive.  Though I've never felt at any point during physical driving the likelihood of tipping over in this truck, it shouldn't give the driver a false sense of security.  This truck sits high and the possibility is always there.  Granted one must completely change diving attitudes when owning this vehicle over, say, a smaller sedan, it is very forgiving when it comes to the occasional driver misjudgment.  City driving is more of a challenge but the mirrors offer ample unblocked vision and the standard night rearview dimming is a lifesaver.  Braking requires more distance than smaller vehicles, don't expect to stop on a dime and be prepared to stand on the brakes if you should find yourself needing to.  I've also found that I do not fit in some of the older garages in the city, too tall by maybe a few inches.  Parallel parking can be chaos but it's not impossible and the cheers from onlookers makes it more rewarding.  Driving in snow with any vehicle outside of a snowmobile is going to require more concentration but the ride height gives the driver the ability to be mobile if needed and the fourwheel drive performed flawless this past winter ('03) in the blizzard Maryland was hit with.  I will say that my back is thankful as I did not even bother to shovel the Navigator out of the spot I was in, just put it in 4wheel drive low and plowed my own way out.  The neighbors were jealous.
