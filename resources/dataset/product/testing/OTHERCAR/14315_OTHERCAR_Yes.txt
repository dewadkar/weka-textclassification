            I looked at many, many small sports cars when I bought this back in July '02.  It was going to be my grad school graduation present to myself, so I wanted something small and fun to enjoy before life demands something big and slow!  As of July '02, I'd say the Spec-V was tops in the sport compact arena.  With 175 hp and a whopping 180 lb-ft of torque, the engine was terrific.  Loaded, it came in below $19k and that included a Rockford-Fosgate system with 6-disc in-dash changer, amp and subwoofer.  (If you want ear-splitting bass, you'll need more hardware.  If you prefer to retain your hearing, this system is excellent.)  I also got a sunroof package, very nice in good weather.  

This car has great acceleration and plenty of power across the low-to-mid RPM range.  It's a whole different story compared to an RSX or even WRX where the power doesn't come on until 4k RPM or higher.  A downside to this motor is that it runs out of breath at higher RPM, and tops out at about 6100 with the rev limiter.  Still, it's very powerful.  Handling is very sharp, with the LSD keeping the wheels locked around tight corners and preventing wheel spin (wheel-hop from a standing start, however, is a problem in this car as with any powerful front-drive).  The interior design of the Sentra is good ergonomically, and the materials look good.  There are still no rattles after 17k miles (hard plastic, but at least it's textured).  

The downsides to the car are mainly transmission-related.  The 6-spd. feels like a good match for the car, but the first 2 gears are short.  The tranny has a very plasticky, hollow, clunky feel to it (with an audible "clunk" on every shift).  5th gear is sometimes easy to miss, and it doesn't feel very sporty.  Passing on the highway doesn't encourage you to downshift for fun, because shifting simply isn't much fun in this car.  Also, gas mileage is around 21-22 mpg, and I've never had higher than 23 even when driving very conservatively.  

The aftermarket for this car is improving rapidly.  I plan to add a cold air intake soon, to improve the top-end power, and possibly a cat-back exhaust for better flow and a sporty note.  Several short-throw kits are availiable which supposedly improve shift quality and feel.  

Overall, this car has been great.  I expect it to last a long time and become a fun project as I add more parts to it.  And for less than $19k, it was a great baragain.  There are now better bargain cars out there, notably the Dodge SRT-4 (Neon) with it's nearly 220 hp turbo engine.  I'd still stick with my Nissan though!
