            When we bought this vehicle we bought it for price, family use and looks.

So far I have noting but LOVE for my Pathfinder!

It is approaching 5years old but you cannot tell. It runs like new, drives like new but the leather seats are softer now :)

Driving my Pathfinder is like a car that sits higher up, it does not feel like a *truck* at all, which is important to me. If I wanted a truck I'd buy one!

With 4 doors and a hatchdoor in the back it is perfect for ANY family.

I have room to go on trips, grocery shopping or just regular errands.

I have the Luxury Edition with all power and I LOVE LOVE LOVE it, and my local Nissan dealer is great about service!!

So if you are a mom or a dad, or even a college student looking for something to haul your stuff around in I would say this is the SUV for you!

If you cant afford new - buy used...you will not be sorry!
