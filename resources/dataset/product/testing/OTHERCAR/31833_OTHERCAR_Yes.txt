            In the mid 80's I purchased a used 1976 Honda Civic 5 speed.  It was the most reliable vehicle I have ever owned.  The auto handled perfectly on bad roads, had all the power I would ever need and was really considerate on my pocket book.  Repairs to my Honda were very few, and not very expensive since I found that they were as easy to repair as any American made vehicle.  As a single parent I believe that for the small family that the 2000 Honda Civic would be a excellent buy for those on a limited budget.  It is priced so that almost anyone can afford it for less than $17,000.  The best part of owning a new Honda is that now they are American made and that just adds to the list of Honda's many great points in my book. In my personal opinion if I had good service from my 76 Honda then I should have good service from a 2000 Honda.    <br><br>
