            This is my third Honda Accord and I love it!  I am only concerned that mine won't be around forever.  It's a 1990 LX and what a car!  Until this month when it needed an alternator, it has barely ever seen a repair shop.  Other than preventative maintenance, the alternator and the radiator are the only things I've replaced. It still has the original clutch, has never had major engine work.  It has one small spot of rust, but the paint still shines and it has never been garaged!  It has sporty handling and a quiet ride. This car owes me nothing.  Honda or bust- I'm a true and loyal fan.<br><br>
