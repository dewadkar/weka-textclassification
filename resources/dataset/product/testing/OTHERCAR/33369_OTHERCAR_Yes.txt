            <b>Keep getting better all the time</b>  
When I decided to trade in my 1997 GLX a few months ago, I seriously considered a SUV.  I have a dog, Madison, and a lot of stuff to tote around-as we all do-like a couple of mountain bikes, a boat, etc.  A SUV just made sense.  That�s until I was reminded of the famed cavernous Jetta trunk.  With the seats in the fold-down position you could land the Spruce Goose in there.  The Jetta's great looks, the fact that it's truly fun to drive, and it's huge trunk all convinced me to stick with VW.  The Jetta�s MPG as compared to a SUV also helped to persuade me.

I drove in with my GLX and I left with a Tornado Red '00 Jetta and haven�t looked back.  After 11k miles, my opinion of the new Jetta, and the model in general, is still very high:  The only significant complaint I have about the car itself is that the engine is a bit noisy for my taste. This seems to be a common compliant among the reviews I�ve read about the car.  Every other aspect of the Jetta I have enjoyed quite a bit.  I�ve even been surprised by a few things.

<b>From the outside to the inside: totally different.</b>  
The Jetta 4 is a completely new car as compared to the Jetta 3.  Everything from the outside design to the interior design has been updated.  Even the crazy sophisticated suspension (ask your service writer to tell you about it) and the way the electrical system works has been updated.  It boasts some very nice features for a sub-$20k car.  Most importantly ;-) there�s <i>finally</i> a cup holder that can take a travel mug.  The previous cup holder would only allow for a can of pop.

<b>Living with the Jetta</b>
I�ve been driving Jettas for quite a long time.  With each model year that passed, VW seemed to build a less aggressive chassis.  This  has led to today�s somewhat mushy, high-center-of-gravity feel under normal driving situations.  Push the car hard and the old taut, sure VW experience returns:  But I can�t always drive this thing like a maniac, though it is more than tempting and the Jetta springs to life under these conditions.

The fit and finish of the Jetta has, however, improved <i>significantly</i> from model year to model year.  One of my biggest gripes about my previous VWs had been the poor quality of the moveable parts on the inside of the car.  From the window regulators to the air vents, it seemed like everything fell apart spontaneously.  After 11k on my current Jetta (and about 36k on my GLX) I have to say VW licked these problems quite nicely.  The 2-year/24k bumper to bumper warranty helps in this area as well.  Anything that does go wrong, large or small, gets fixed FOC.

<b>I also like:</b>
Automatic door locks that activate at 10 mph
Purple dash lights
The 60/40 fold down rear seats
Theater lighting: the interior lights dim gradually rather than &quot;snap&quot; off
Remote trunk opener and door locks
Side markers
�Slow motion� glove box

Though I've read that other's have enjoyed their dealer experience, I can't say the same.  In fact, I've yet to have a really good experience buying a new VW.  A definite area of improvement for VW, in my epinion.

My after purchase service experience has been hit or miss.  The best service center I've come across (I've been to at least 10 different dealerships in four states) is Broadway VW in Green Bay, WI of all places.  The VW service manager has always been very helpful, attentive, and understanding. <b>Brandon, you rule!</b>

<b>Bottom line:</b> I rated the new Jetta with four out of five stars; knocking one off for the poor dealer/service experiences.  But if you love VWs, then by all means give the new Jetta a test drive.  You'll be surprised at what you can get for the sticker price.  In fact, VW is putting more in the new Jetta dollar-for-dollar over the Jetta 3.
