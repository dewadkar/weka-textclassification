            I bought a new v-6 Accord in may of '98 and have mostly great things to say about it...even the dealership has been more or less fair with me if you can believe that.

Some small problems I should note right now have to do with the tires and fuel gauge.  The bridgestone tires that came with the car are kind of chinsy...I lost three already...2 due to blowouts and 1 due to some road hazard (I drove over something one night.)  Yes, I do check the tire pressure regularly.   The fuel gauge seemed to read incorrectly, at first I though it was just me, but when I went to get a checkup at the dealership they said it was a common problem with that model and corrected it at no charge.  I have checked a couple of websites and found that many people have reported this problem.

But everything else, I would have to say, has been on the plus side...performance, comfort, handling...etc.<br><br>
