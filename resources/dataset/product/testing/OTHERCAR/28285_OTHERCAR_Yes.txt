            In January of 1999 I purchased a Dodge Durango.  I was looking for an attractive well built Sports Utility Vehicle and I had my eye on the Durango for quite some time.  I hadn't heard any negative opinions about the Durango and after test driving it and really looking it over, I was hooked.  Since I have had the Durango, I have had only one problem.  The driver side window got stuck in the up position soon after I bought it.  I took it to the Dodge dealership and it was fixed very quickly.  The technicians were professional and courteous and the problem has not returned. 
One of the options I went for was the trailer tow hitch.  This has saved my butt on two separate occasions (literally).  I was twice rear-ended by careless drivers and both times, the trailer hitch cushioned the impact.  My Durango took little or no damage in each of the accidents, and in one of the accidents the other car was virtually totaled.  I have no doubt that in another vehicle, I would have been injured.
I highly recommend the Durango to anyone interested in luxury, comfort, reliability and power.  The 5.91 Liter engine has all the power you will ever need. The only complaint I have is that since I got it, I have become the designated driver to about every event I attend.  People love it, but then again, so do I.<br><br>
