            WOW! For $32000 I can't think of a better car!

The engine has got to be one of the best I've ever seen. The 3.5L "VQ" V6 lays down great power for passing in any gear at any speed, even over 75mph. Off the line it pulls away very nicely without any tire spin. It is whisper-quiet even at 100mph. Gas usage is about average for a large V6, in the area of 16-18mpg. My only gripe is that the automatic transmission with a poorly-designed manual shifting mode. The Nissan 350Z's 6-speed manual has since been added as an option for those who like to row through the gears. I opted for automatic because in heavy traffic I hate stick shift.

The styling is quite dynamic. From some angles it appears to be ready to pounce, and from others it is subdued and sexy. The rear is a bit odd but you will get used to it. My only gripe on looks: why the cheap unpainted side sills?

The interior is very unique. I can't say I outright hate it, but it isn't the best I've ever seen. The entire front dashboard feels like it doesn't belong in this car, perhaps in the Q45 or the liking. The front and rear seats are comfortable for long drives. The rear seats even recline for comfort. The instrumentation is easy to read, but the stereo/climate controls may take some getting used to. Infiniti oddly placed volume controls on the side away from the driver.

The handling seems to be quite good for a car of its size (3400lbs). The VDC (stability control) intervenes if you get too crazy. I have found that it gets a bit tail-happpy at times, but I do drive aggressively. It tracks straight and offers good steering feedback, and is responsive for emergency manuevers. For 3400lbs, this thing rides on rails.

So far it seems bulletproof. There was a recall on the fuel pump that is fairly minor.

This car blows away the competition.
