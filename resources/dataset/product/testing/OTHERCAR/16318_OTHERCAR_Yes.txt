                 This past August, I gave birth to my beautiful son Kyle! Within two weeks of his arrival, I had already gone through 3 rolls of film, which of course had to be developed. On top of that, I of course had to order double prints so family members could enjoy my pictures as well! I thought about getting a digital camera, but knew absolutely nothing about this device.

     I ventured out to the local Best Buy in my area, and was greeted by a very helpful salesman. I knew I wanted to stay in the $300.00 price range, so I had a choice between a Kodak, and the Hewlett Packard. The only reason I chose the Hewlett Packard camera, was solely because the Kodak camera was not currently in stock. Well, I am very pleased that I chose the Hewlett Packard! Hewlett Packard is easy to use, offers a variety of features, and has a wonderful picture quality.

     First, seeing that I have never used a digital camera, I expected to be fooling around with this gadget for hours until I got the hang of it! Not so! The installation of the software was a breeze, and the instructions for the use of the camera were clear and concise! Every feature on this camera is listed on a simple menu located on the LCD of the camera!

     Next, I began to experiment with taking pictures. There are three quality settings on this camera, which are Basic, Fine, and Super Fine. If you plan on solely using your pictures on the internet, the Basic setting will suffice. If you plan on printing your pictures on your printer, I would definitely suggest using the Super Fine setting. I have several pictures taken from my digital camera, and not one person yet has noticed a difference in photo quality! The pictures come out clear, and sharp! I do offer one suggestion though. Make sure when you take the picture that the lighting in the background is very bright. It makes a significant difference in how well the picture will come out.

     Last, but not least, the features on this camera are top notch for the price! This camera offers feature such as Auto Flash, 2x digital zoom, red eye reduction, and Auto Focus! Who could ask for more? I purchased my camera at Best Buy for an affordable price of $279.00.  I also purchase a battery recharger, since the batteries die very quickly. To prolong the life of your battery, do not use the LCD when taking pictures. All in all, I am extremely pleased with my purchase, and would suggest that anyone who is in the market for an inexpensive digital camera check this camera out!<br><br>
