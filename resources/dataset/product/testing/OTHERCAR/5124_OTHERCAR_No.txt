            I would never buy a Dodge product again as long as I live.  Dodge is the worst company I have ever dealt with.  Our new Intrepid came with a serious defect in the engine that was tagged in the factory (the fix-it tag was still there in the engine, though hidden) but never fixed.  When our engine failed and we contacted Dodge about it, they kept the car for 4 weeks, made a glue-it-together fix with no guarantee, then told us to live with it.  And they dented our car in the bargain while they had it and refused to fix it.   So now we are stuck with a $22,000 car whose engine could fail at any time.  Additionally, there have been 3 recalls on the car already. Two friends of mine had similar experiences with their Dodge cars.  Along the way, at every level from high to low, Dodge representatives were arrogant and surly.  Run, don't walk away from Dodge products.  It's back to Honda for me.<br><br>
