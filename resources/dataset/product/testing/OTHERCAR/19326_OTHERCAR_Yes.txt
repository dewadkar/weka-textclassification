            PLEASE NOTE, THIS OPINION IS ON THE ACURA 2001 MDX AND NOT THE 1999 SLX


Four weeks ago my wife traded in her 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee for a 2001
Acura MDX.  While she fell in love with the Cherokee's looks &amp; roominess, over time my wife began to complain about the &quot;rough edge&quot; in the Cherokee's handling, which basically handles like the truck that it is. 
Despite the fact that we took a beating on the trade-in value of the Cherokee, I must say this is the wisest money we've ever allocated towards a the purchase of a new vehicle.  We purchased the base model which is generously equipped at $ 35,000.00.  She decided on the
Mesa Beige Metallic with the Saddle interior which looks great inside and out.  

My wife went out of town for a week so I had the opportunity to drive her MDX for 5 days straight and I am very impressed by a number of the MDX's features.   Firstly, I thoroughly enjoy the MDX's exterior appearance which is elegantly understated and devoid of too much darkened or chrome trim.  Secondly, the MDX's interior is nicely designed, the epitome of simplicity and practicality.  The dash board's gauges are easy to see and read and its controls are easy to operate and their location easy to memorize.  It is perhaps the most uncluttered dashboard that I've ever seen on a SUV and I especially enjoy the combination radio and CD player and that its volume and radio station settings can be adjusted from the steering wheel.   I also found the trip computer to be useful and easy to operate though at night its glare can be distracting.   I am 6'2'' tall with long legs and I must say that given the size of the MDX that its driver and front passenger legroom could have been more generous.  The leather interior is beautifully crafted with ventilated surfaces on the seating portions and the driver's chair is quite comfortable and firm.  
The seat warmers feel great however I only wish there were a medium setting and not just a low and high.  Another comforting feature of the driver's position is the ample and soft middle armrest whose lid flips open and turns into a cup holder.   The second row bench is also very comfortable with a generous middle armrest in the absence of a middle passenger.  The third row bench seat is a great innovation in that it folds a flat 180 degrees into the floor of the MDX.  What is more the second row bench also folds flat making for an oversized storage space which can fit a 4' x 8' sheet of plywood, not that I intend to try this.  Behind the third row bench are significantly ample storage compartments especially below the floor.  

The road performance of the MDX is a breath of fresh air compared to the Cherokee's rough handling.   On the street or on the highway the MDX has a marvelously solid and firm feel to it without being overbearing like that of the &quot;trucky&quot; Cherokee.   In my opinion the ride is absolutely superb without the vehicle losing its SUV appeal, though my wife says it drives like a German luxury sedan.  On curves the MDX glides through them, of course like any other vehicle with a high center of gravity you don't want to over do it.  However, I feel very confident going above the speed limit on sharp curves with the MDX because its suspension does not allow for excessive leaning.  Unlike the Cherokee, after driving the MDX for over a 100 miles straight, my sensitive back felt great and not irritated when I stepped out of the vehicle.   I especially enjoy the 5 speed automatic transmission for it makes for a quieter ride with less engine noise.  While the MDX has a 240 horsepower engine, it has great acceleration for a vehicle of this weight and size, it actually feels more powerful than the Cherokee's V-8!  It is a smooth running engine that can hardly be heard or felt during idling.  Acura diligently coupled the engine and transmission which transitions very smoothly from gear to gear.  The MDX's interior gives the impression of being constructed of a solid piece of material for there are no squeaks or rattles even at high speeds on bumpy roads.   Of course when one stabs the gas pedal the engine's decibels increase with an enjoyable meaty purr.   But overall the interior space is quiet while one drives and conducive to soft conversation.  I drove the vehicle on muddy roads at a friend's Napa Valley farm, for I wanted to test the all wheel drive system on the MDX, and it is quite sensitive &amp; powerful to say the least, I especially appreciate being able to keep the all wheel drive activated with a lock button during very low speeds (below 20 mph) should one drive on ice or other slippery surfaces.  Besides the driver's legroom, my only substantial complaint about the MDX are the brakes, they leave much to be desired.  You have to really make sure you don't get too close to other vehicles in front of you while driving, for the brakes aren't as powerful as I think they should be.  They require a lot of exertion and nail biting braking distance in order to make the MDX come to a stand still.  
Mind you, the vehicle handles nicely while stopping even while slowing down in a turn, but the braking system's performance needs improvement.  

Nevertheless, braking aside, the MDX is a magnificent vehicle well worth the money.  Anyone who is looking at an SUV that seats 7 passengers should strongly consider owning an MDX.  Folks who aren't ready for a mini van, but need passenger and storage space should take a close look at the MDX.   I don't believe there is anyone who shouldn't own an MDX, short of people who want an SUV that handles like a truck.
