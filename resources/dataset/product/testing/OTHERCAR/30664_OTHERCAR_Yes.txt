            I've got the '97 JGC Laredo and I LOVE it. I bought it because: my previous car (a 1985 Toyota Tercel) had died and I needed another, I wanted something bigger than the Tercel, when I saw it I knew I would get it. I'd test driven a 1999 Dodge Ram V8 just before the Jeep and I nearly got it instead, but I just couldn't say no to the Jeep. 

One of my favourite things about the JGC is how comfortable it is. I recently drove it on a whirlwind road-trip from Los Angeles to Las Vegas to Sedona, Az to Phoenix, Az back to Los Angeles. I ended up timing the whole trip with a stop watch and clocked around 21 hours in the Jeep. I was pretty sure that the vehicle was comfortable before but now I'm POSITIVE that it's comfortable. It's easy to settle into the front seats without feeling like I'm going to tip back or get sucked into the car and the back seats are firm without feeling like you're sitting on a park bench. 

Going from my little Tercel to the Jeep it's hard for me to compare the acceleration and power, except to say it's got it. It's a little slow starting out, getting up on to the highway, but once you're up on the road, you're off and running. It takes a bit of a push to get your speed up dramatically when you've got OD on and you're out on the highway, but don't worry, the power's there. Also, at least on MY vehicle, the Cruise Control tops out at 88/89 MPH. 

As far as the on-deck controls, I have no trouble reaching any of them. It took me a few tries to figure out how to set the radio stations, I was used to pull-out/push-in buttons, not this fancy high-tech stuff. (: The controls in the ceiling panel are easily accessible as well; flipping through the temperature, odometer, DTE and the like is simple and minimally distracting. 

The JGC has quite a bit of cargo space, too. At least, for my purposes it does. We managed to fit a fairly good sized Sunbeam grill into the back of the truck with little problem. 

All-in-all I'm extremely happy with my truck (okay, you call it an SUV, I call it a truck) and hope I don't (a) have issues with it any time soon (b) have to get rid of it anytime soon. I'm hoping once wintertime rolls around, I'll have an excuse to use the roof-rack. That's the last bit of unexplored territory on it. <br><br>
