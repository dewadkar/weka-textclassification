            I bought my Blazer in 1999 when it had 26,000 miles on it. It currently has 42,000 on it. My blazer is a 4x4 model and has 4 door and almost fully loaded.

 Some of the problems we have had is the driver's side mirror would vibrate and make looking at images in it blurry, the dealer replaced the mirror assembly. The water pump developed a leak at about 30,000 miles and the dealer installed a new one. The rear window washer leaked and had to be repaired by the dealer. The fuel pump started to make a strange noise and the dealer replaced it. My blazer stopped going into 4 wheel drive and the dealer replaced what they called a transfer box assembly. At about 38,000 miles one of the rear shocks started leaking and had to be replaced. At 40,000 miles the Blazer developed a transmission leak, the dealer told me that a transmission service would fix the problem and it did. Now the rear passenger window control has stopped working and we will have it fix in a couple of weeks.

 I purchased the extended warranty for 6 years/60,000 miles and everything has been covered under the warranty except for the shocks and the transmission. The shocks which are not covered under the extended warranty cost me $263.00. The leaking transmission cost me $154.00 but since it was so close to the time that the transmission needed service I didn't feel to bad.

 All in all I feel that the Blazer is a pretty good vehicle, but it just seems to have a bunch of minor problems that pop up every couple of months. If you buy one I highly recommend buying the extended warranty! I would also have it checked out by a mechanic if you purchase a used one.   

 This Blazer has only been off road 1 time and is used only to go back and forth to work and get groceries and run errands. The only times that it has been in 4 wheel drive is when it has been snowy or icy here in Colorado and I would say that has been about 10 times since I've owned it. We have all of its maintenance done on schedule by the dealer.

 The blazer does drive pretty nice and seems very safe. It does everything that we ask of it and it is pretty handy to carry things inside of it. Gas mileage is about 18 miles to the gallon which isn't too bad considering how much this thing weighs.

 In conclusion I due recommend the Blazer but just watch out.
