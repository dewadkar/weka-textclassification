            The 1994 E320 offers a wonderful combination of style, reliable performance, excellent resale value, and best of all safety.  The current used market reflects that the car is worth 65% of the new car price  - not bad for a six year-old car.  

The reliable and powerful 215 HP V6 comes on strong when asked, but provides considerably smoother performance under normal driving demands.  The silky smooth automatic transmission is also likely to remain troublefree with regular changes of fluid and filter.  When maintained at the dealer these low-cost preventive maintenance chores will pay big dividends when it comes time to sell the car (since most Mercedes owners don't do their own maintenance).  

The interior is well-appointed and comfortable.  The standard amenities are numerous including dual air bags, 8-speaker stereo, excellent climate control, and the now famous power seats.  The seat control is very well designed (which actually looks like a seat).  This type of forethought in ergonomic design is rewarding to the driver - an intuitive and functional control requiring no training, no documentation, or even explanation.  You simply look, understand, and complete your task.

The same cannot be said, however, of the poor placement of the power window controls.  If the driver elects to use the armrest, the controls are simply inaccessible (they are in the center console under the armrest).

The exterior styling is a little understated compared to the newer body style E-class with the oval front headlamps (after 1995), but nevertheless elegant, and distinctly Mercedes.  The lower plastic panels can be somewhat distracting for certain color combinations, but serve a functional purpose in reducing scratches and dings from rocks being thrown onto the paint by the wheels (these panels eliminate the need for the unsightly mud flaps).  

Overall, a great car with great value.  With an average of about 60K miles for most cars of this vintage, the E320 is just getting broken in.  At a price in the mid-20's, the car with all it's luxury still comes in at less than the average price of a new car.  Drive the car and you'll be able to appreciate a fine example of famous German engineering at it's finest.
