            Ever since the auto show pictures of the new TL became available I decided to put my purchase of a new sport sedan on hold. I love some of the German cars but the maintenance cost and overall reliability just don't compare to the Japanese. Unfortunately, the Japanese just don't make vehicles which deliver the same driving experience as their German competitors, so its a toss up. But, since I am ever hopeful that a Japanese car could be as fun as it is practical, as soon as one was available I rushed down to the Acura dealer to drive a beautiful silver 2004 Acura TL with the sportshift automanual, ebony leather interior and navigation system. 

Exterior:

Acura's designers have really done well with this vehicle. While at first, it conjured some blurred images of Pontiac Bonneville (horrors), after spending some time looking at the car I became more and more impressed. Whereas the previous model was absolutely hideous, the new TL is truly a fabulous looking design, somewhat akin to the TSX, but more muscular and purposeful. Shorter overhangs than in prior years give it a more European appearance, and the short and relatively high rear deck give it more of a sporting flair. Personally, I would like to see Acura shorten the front overhang and put more room into the trunk (a la 3 series), but that is a minor quibble. This car would however, benefit from more substantial wheel and tire treatments. I have yet to see one with the optional 18 inch rims, but I am sure it would be an improvement over the bland OEM. At the end of the day, this is the best looking Japanese sedan on the road, period.

Interior:

The new TL's interior is not the best in class (to date, nobody has beat Audi), but it is definitely second in both quality of materials and overall design. The large navigation screen is seamlessly integrated into the tasteful blend of brushed aluminum accents, quality leather and soft touch plastics. Switchgear quality and operation is top notch and the interior lighting is a very cool shade of blue that matches the back light of my cell phone. Acura has even stolen an Audi interior element and incorporated two LEDs into the panel above the center stack. At night it casts a cool blue glow on the area. The back seat is not roomy (a la Nissan Maxima), but has adequate amounts of shoulder, hip and leg room for a 6 footer. The area where interior space has taken a beating due to the 2004's shorter dimensions is the trunk. I would say it is about identical to a 3 Series in capacity (which isn't roomy). On the freeway at ridiculously extralegal speeds (I had her up to 115 mph before the salesperson pulled the plug) the interior is a remarkably quiet and pleasant place to be. The stereo is absolutely fantastic and the dual zone climate control works exceptionally well. Furthermore, the front seats are absolutely top notch, with plenty of adjustability, side bolstering and overall comfortable support.  

Some would probably argue (as would I) that the Lexus ES330 has a more luxurious interior, but the Lexus is about as sporting as my grandma's Town Car and as such, is not a true competitor. Similarly, the BMW 5 Series may well be of higher quality, but comparing the 5 Series to the TL is a stretch at best. A similarly equipped 2004 5 Series will add three years of private elementary school tuition (approximately $18 large) to the out the door price of a new TL so naturally one would expect it to have a higher quality interior (I would argue that the new 5 Series interior has been totally "Bangled" however, and doesn't come close to the TL in appearance). The TL is really competing with the 3 series and from an interior design, roominess and ambience standpoint, comes out ahead.

Performance:

After being truly impressed with the looks and design of the TL I was hoping to be equally as impressed with its road manners so I could take one home. In short, I was a little underwhelmed. Acura claims 270 hp and 238 ftlbs of twist from its 3.2 liter V6, which supposedly deliver a 0-60 time of 6 seconds flat. I would dispute this claim, though not by much, at least with the sportshift automanual. The TL's peak torque hits at 5,000 rpm and as such, it takes longer than it should for the car to get up to speed. The TL is no slouch, it is actually a quick car, however, it just doesn't have the urgency of a 330i or G35 off the line. The reason is the car's (excessively) tall gearing. For example, doing 75mph in fourth gear the engine only turns 3,000 rpm. At 85 in fifth, the TL jogs along at 2,650. Great for gas mileage and engine longevity, not great for acceleration. Another contributing factor to the (seemingly) underwhelming acceleration may be the excessive time it takes the sportshift to execute upshifts. The tranny is very compliant and smooth but is nearly as slow as the tiptronic in competing VWs. Once you hit the meat of the engine's powerband, it pulls nicely, and is never rough or intrusive like nearly all American made engines seem to be. 

As with all new cars, Acura claims astronomical increases in the rigidity of the new TL's structure. One look at the strut tower brace in the new vehicle is all it will take to convince you they are not playing fast and loose with the numbers. It's something akin to a softball bat stretched across the back of the engine bay. Unfortunately, the increase in rigidity does not appear to have done much for the TL's handling. Taking 270 degree freeway on ramps and sharp corners at speed in this vehicle result in predictable but unsavory wallowing and understeer. The TL offers a wonderfully comfortable ride on the freeway and around town, but its handling and excessive body roll are not really sporting at all. I have a quick and easy test to determine whether a car's suspension is set up correctly (for the most part) that I use every time I drive a new car, which of course I used on the TL. While driving straight, rock the steering wheel back and forth. Sharp but minor steering inputs side to side. The car should feel like it is simply rocking from side to side. In the TL and other vehicles with slow to react suspension set ups, you instead get a twisting sensation. It's as though the rear of the car takes a second to catch up with the inputs coming from up front. Not the sensations that a sporting sedan should generate.

In addition to the wallowing, steering feel is mediocre at best, accompanied by torque steer that would make an Audi/VW driver cringe. The TL really needs stiffer spring rates and some anti-roll/squat devices to even begin to be a competitor with the legendary 3 Series. Then Acura engineers would need to scoot the engine back about a foot, incorporate rear wheel drive, and they might really have something. For now, the new TL is tuned for luxury, not sport. Perhaps the ES330 really is the competition.

I had high hopes for the TL. I don't want to be yet another sounding board for BMW, but what the heck? Is there a reason that no Japanese manufacturer can get it all right, all at once? The G35 sedan performs well but is ugly and the interior looks like it was designed by Canon camcorder engineers. The latest Maxima: all wrong everywhere. Camry, Accord: surely you jest. Lexus? zzzzzzzz.....Note to Japanese automobile manufacturers: I WILL PAY JUST AS MUCH FOR A JAPANESE SPORT SEDAN AS I WILL FOR A GERMAN ONE IF YOU WILL MAKE ONE THAT CAN TRULY COMPETE. Not to mention Detroit. They're 5 to 10 years and an imagination behind the TL, much less the standard. The TL is 2/3rds of the way there, but after driving it, a 2004 BMW 330i is on its way.  

Update:

I recently received some literature from Acura on the TL which explained that the TL's weight distribution is 61/39 front/rear. This confirmed my suspicions regarding the engine being mounted too far forward (along with the front wheel drive set up) to allow for truly sporting handling characteristics.
