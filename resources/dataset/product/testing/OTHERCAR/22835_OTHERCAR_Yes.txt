            I'm 19 years old, and purchasing my first car outright.  After breaking down 3 times in a 1992 Chevy Corsica that I had just bought from a dealer, I brought it back to find my future infatuation sitting on the lot:  a 1991 Acura Integra LS Hatchback.  After returning the Chevy disgrace, I swung a deal to drive home the Acura.  I couldn't be happier!!!  The car has 170,000 miles, but drives like it has 70,000, and everyone has told me that Integra's run well over 250,000 miles.  And after driving it, now I see why.  The 1.8L DOHC 4 cylinder 135 hp engine is surprisingly fast, and I've done my fair share of dusting plenty of 4.6L V8 Mustang &quot;hogs&quot; over the past couple of days.  So much for American ingenuity!!!  The ride is very smooth and comfortable, the car is extremely modern and sporty looking (a real head turner, especially with the proper mods), and it gets excellent fuel economy(about 26 mpg).  I couldn't ask more out of a 9 year old vehicle.  My only complaint is a leak in the A/C system that drips into the cabin onto the carpet.  But my mechanic (who is very trustworthy) has told me that this is an inexpensive repair.  Compared to the American cars I have owned in the past, this is nothing to gripe about.

I would recommend an Integra to anyone.

My next car (2 years down the road)????  A NEW INTEGRA!!!!!!<br><br>
