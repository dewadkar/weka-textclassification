            The VW Passat is truly in a class by itself.  No other car or car maker is pushing the design envelope as well as VW.  From the cute bug to the gorgeous Passat, they're leaving the competition in the dust.  I've been a loyal Japanese Car driver from the very beginning.  Who can beat their dependability and functionality?  VW has put together a car in the Passat that exudes cutting edge design.  But, you also get great german engineering which I learned very quickly. They include:  Side impact air bags, powerful power windows, the inside lights go on when you enter and turn-off when you start the car, the trunk and hood have automatic hyrdrolic lifts that open the doors automatically, lowest drag coefficent for this class...I'm a believer now in german engineering.  I chose the Nebio Blue color with V6 engine with a manual stick. If you get the V6, then you get standard this awesome walnut stick shift with walnut door handles.  Plus you get a 190 horsepower engine that flys off the line.  The thing I notice is that people tend to think it's a very expensive car and they love the design.  You get lots of positive attention when you drive around.<br><br>
