I had been wanting a digital camera forever, but I was very afraid to buy one.  I am not the best picture taker in the world, and I didn't want to spend a lot of money on something I was afriad I wouldn't use or wouldn't know how to use.  I searched online, and I asked many friends for their advice, but I just couldn't reach a desicion. My husband finally tired of hearing me whine, so he gave me the money to buy a camera for my birthday.  My computer does not have a USB port, so that fact, and my budget where my main problems when buying the camera.

I found my Polaroid PCD 640 on sale at Wal-Mart for $150.00.  It was the cheapest camera available that had a built-in flash and Creative software.  The salesman warned me that I would need to stock up on extra batteries, and he also told me not to exspect photo quality prints from the camera.

I brought the camera home, and took the contents out of the box.   The camera included with it a memory card, four AA batteries, a camera case, camera to TV connector, Image Maker software, AC power adapter, a user's guide, and a camera to computer cable (RS-232C serial cable). I read the user guide, and the instructions seemed very easy-to-follow, so I loaded up the batteries, and began snapping away.  First, the camera has two different methods of viewfinding. You can use the optical viewfinder, or you can use the LCD viewfinder.  The LCD viewfinder is my favorite method, but it is slower in processing and flash time, and it drains a lot of your battery life. The LCD view shows you exactly what your picture will look like, so you can immediately discard unwanted photos.

The subject of your picture doesn't have to stay in a specific range in order for you to take a great picture.  The camera has three different distance settings, ranging from 1/2 to the 3 feet or more from the camera. This allows for a clear picture, no matter where the subject is from the camera. I tend to use the Normal Lens setting for most of my pictures.  This setting is great when you are taking a picture of a large crowd (can you say family gathering??), or when you want to get the scenery of an area in your photo.

 The camera also has 4 different types of flash settings:

1- Autoflash- The camera's flash fires automatically when needed.
2- Fill Flash- Fires for every picture. Should be used when there is a light behind the subject, or on a very cloudy day.
3- No Flash- Can be used in places where flashes are not allowed, or in the case of a reflective background, like a mirror or window
4- Red Eye- This flash fires automatically when needed. Each flash has a pre-flash to held ruduce red-eye in your photos.

I personally have some trouble knowing when and when not to use my flash, so I usually use the Fill Flash so that I can be guarenteed not have have dark photos.  So, far-so, good. All of my picutres have turned out great, so I must be doing something right-HAHA!

This camera also has four different resolution settings.  The super-high setting (640 X 480 resolution) has minimal compression, and allows your camera to store up to 12 pictures.  The lowest resolution setting has the ability to store up to 96 images, but there is no compression with this setting.  To be very honest, I do not know that much about what resolution means, but through experience, I have learned that the quality of photos is best in the highest resolutions.  The pictures look great in emails, and with other computer applications, but they are not exactly Olan Mills when printed.  The salesman at Wal-mart warned me that if I wanted to print my pictures-in photo quality when printed, I would need to buy a more exspensive, higher resolution camera.

The camera also has the ability to let you preview, save and delete your photos before uploading them onto computer.  The camera can be set with the date and time, and you can buy addition memory for the camera for about 50 dollars.

Uploading the pictures onto your computer is a very easy, but sometimes time consuming process. Since the camera does not have a USB cable, the serial cable usuage takes a little more time. However, once you have figured out your software, editing and working with your pictures is a very easy task.  My camera came with a kit that lets you have all kinds of fun with your camera, such as making T-shirts, and greeting cards.

I am pleased with my camera. I urge a new buyer to buy lots of extra batteries though. Mine were drained in probably about 4 days, and trying to take pictures while attached to the AC cord isnï¿½t that easy.   An additional memeory card is a good idea too. You never know when you will want to take additional photoes than one card will store.
