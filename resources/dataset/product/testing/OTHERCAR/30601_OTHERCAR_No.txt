            We bought this vehicle because we live in the Northwest and really wanted a 4x4 vehicle to get around in the snow.

After 25 times to the service department, in 3+ years, we decided to get something different.

I loved how it handled in the snow.  We could go just about anywhere.  It was great.

It was the &quot;little&quot; things that we hated.  The rear door locks broke and stayed locked.  The front windows became really slow (they were power), and the seatbelts wouldn't retract right.  All of the things were fixable, but very annoying to deal with.  The last problem we had was the idle was stuck or something.  When you would idle the RPM's would go to between 3000-4000.  It wasn't anything mechanical - we checked and tried everything first.  

I also liked the fact that you sit higher than the cars do.  I believe it is better for your driving ability - to see farther.  It handled like a car and you could almost always find a parking spot.  Plus it was great on gas.

If you want a cheaper 4x4 vehicle, this one is ok.  Ours spent more time at the shop than in the garage.  Just be forewarned.

P.S. The dealership would literally laugh at us when we brought it in for service.  Almost as if to say &quot;you fools bought a what?&quot;<br><br>
