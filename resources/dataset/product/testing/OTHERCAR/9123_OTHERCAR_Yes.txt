            I bought my Gmc Yukon because I like the Design and the Features it had to offer has anything from cloth to leather, seat warmer, compass, outside temperature and plenty of cup holders and storage.I like the ability that you can fold down the rear seats and have plenty of cargo room to hall all your stuff you need to hall the thing I dislike about it is the fact that you can't get bigger tires from the factory but overall it is a practical truck to own.the Yukon is a great truck to drive the seats are real comfortable and adjust in many direction so that you are comfortable the ride is soft with little road noise good braking and it has very good turning radious. The person that should buy the Yukon is just about anyone plenty of room for family plenty of room for luggage or anything you need to hall in a sport utility vehicle as long as it is in you price range.<br><br>
