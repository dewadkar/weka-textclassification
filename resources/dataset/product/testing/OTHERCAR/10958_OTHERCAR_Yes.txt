            My freshman year in high school, I took a course in photography that I greatly enjoyed.  That was with a regular manual camera and 35mm black and white film.  Also being an electronics/computer/gadget buff, the world of digital photography greatly interested me from the start. My first digital camera, a cheap E-Zonics model that doubled as a webcam was a total disappointment, so I decided to step it up a little.  Seeing as how I wasn't a very experienced photographer, I didn't want something too expensive, but i also didn't want to get a camera that produced blurred, grainy pictures.  Enter, the Canon PowerShot A300.

Priced as a first digital camera, the PowerShot A300 would suit both a student like myself and a photographer who is just starting out.  Coming from one of the most respected and reliable camera and imaging manufacturers in the world, you know it will be a good camera.  Combining affordability with quality is something that Canon does very well.

<b>Features</b>

&#149 <i>Pixel Count</i> - 3.2 Mega-pixels to ensure high quality images.  I have found practically no flaws in the pictures that I have taken.  They are clear and not grainy at all.


&#149 <i>Movie Clips</i> - You can record up to three minutes of video with this camera in either 320x240 resolution or 160x120 resolution, both in 15 frames per second.  The video is accompanied by high quality sound.


&#149 <i>Image Resolution</i> - 2048 x 1536, 1600 x 1200, 1024 x 768, or 640 x 480.  2048 x 1536 will yield the largest images while taking the most amount of space, whereas 640 x 480 will yield smaller, less memory-consuming images.


&#149 <i>Lens</i> - 33mm equivalent fixed lens.  As with any lens on any camera, treat this with care.  It is very fragile and sensitive, and must be kept clean for best results.  As this is one of, if not the single most important part of the camera, so be sure it is protected.  And never, under any circumstances, touch it with your fingers.  Oil and dirt will create fingerprints on the lens, and they will in turn have an adverse effect on your pictures.


&#149 <i>Digital Zoom</i> -  This camera equips a digital zoom of up to 5.1x.  You won't be able to spot a bird sitting high up in a tree or anything, but it's still pretty good if you ask me.


&#149 <i>Flash</i> - The built-in flash comes with Red-Eye reduction included.  This can be switched on or off.  I generally don't use it, as I have other photo editing programs that can do a better job of it than the camera itself can.  You can also turn the flash on or off, set it on automatic, or manual.


&#149 <i>Focus</i> - The PowerShot A300 includes a 5-point AiAF (<b>A</b>rtificial <b>I</b>ntelligent <b>A</b>uto <b>F</b>ocus).  This nifty little feature allows the entire picture to be sharp, rather than just what the middle of the frame contains.  This feature comes in handy especially when you are photographing a moving object, and the object moves slightly out of the middle.  Your picture will not be ruined because of a focusing problem now, as the whole image will be perfectly focused and sharp.  Also an option on this camera are 1-point Auto Focus and AF assist beam, which helps to focus in dim lighting by emitting an orangish beam of light.


&#149 <i>White Balance</i> - There are seven different selections for white balance.  These are auto, daylight, cloudy, tungsten, fluorescent, fluorescent H, and custom.  I really have not yet used any of these besides auto, so I can't tell you much about them.


&#149 <i>Shooting Mode</i> - These are auto, manual, stitch assist, and movie.  The auto is what I mainly use, though I also use manual sometimes.  The stitch assist is used for panoramic pictures.  It places one picture on the side of the screen and overlaps it with the image in the viewfinder to help you line up the next picture in the series.  The movie mode allows you to record up to 3 minutes of video with sound.


&#149 <i>Photo Effects</i> - Vivid, neutral, low sharpening, sepia, and black/white are the included photographic effects on this camera.  I have used the sepia mode to create some wonderful "old-timey" pictures and have used the black and white mode to create some nice pictures.  Usually, if I use the black and white mode, it is because I am going to  do a coloring effect in Photoshop, so I prefer to start with a base that has no color.  The vivid mode makes colors, well, more vivid, and the neutral mode softens bright colors.  I hardly ever use the vivid mode, as I prefer to have softer colors, but neutral has turned out some pretty good pictures.


&#149 <i>Storage</i> - Compact Flash Type I.  Included with this camera is a 16 megebyte card, but i would suggest investing in a larger card.  16 Mb isn't enough to store too many high-resolution pictures.


&#149 <i>Supplied Software</i> - Includes ZoomBrowser EX (Windows), ImageBrowser (Mac), PhotoRecord, PhotoStitch and RemoteCapture software, all made by Canon.  These programs work well with the camera, but there are better programs out there.  They are not the worst, but also not the best.  For photo editing, I would suggest either PaintShopPro or Adobe Photoshop, both very respectable and powerful programs.  I use photoshop.


&#149 <i>Other Features</i> - This camera runs on two AA batteries.  I would suggest getting some rechargeable batteries, as AA's will end up running you a fortune if you constantly use the camera.  It is approximately 4.4in x 2.3in x 1.5 in, so it is small enough to fit in a purse, pocket, or backpack.  I keep mine in a case, as a measure of caution.  Remember that there are very sensitive parts that can get damaged easily, so take care of your camera!  It weighs about half a pound, so it really isn't a bother to carry around.  The LSD TFT screen offers sharp contrast and preview images, but is rather small.  Then again, the camera itself is rather small, so they made it about as big as they possibly could without crowding out any of the other buttons.  It connects to your computer via a USB cable, and you can print directly from the camera if you own a Canon Bubble Jet Direct Printer or a Canon CP-series portable Card Photo Printer.  Owners also get access to the Canon Image Gateway for more online editing features and albums.


<b>My Use</b>
I have used the Canon PowerShot A300 on many occasions, all with good results.  Most recently, I used it to photograph my cousin's communion and the following party.  My favorite pictures are of the landscape and of all of my relatives.  I have a large family, so it is usually pretty tough to fit them all in one picture.  However, using the features on the camera, I was able to pull it off well.  I also used the stitch assist mode to create a pretty cool panoramic of my entire family.  I took an individual picture of each person with a little extra room on the sides, then stitched them together, and the result was quite interesting.  Also, my relatives live on a two-acre plot of land in Virginia, but are backed by a 600-acre state park and reservoir.  We took all of the kids (and believe me, there's a lot of them!) and five dogs with us to enjoy the nice day.  I got a few beautiful pictures of the dogs running around wild, and some nice pictures of the woods.  The lake offered a great photo opportunity, though.  I returned at sunset, hoping to get some pictures of the colors reflecting in the water.  I have tried this with practically no success with normal color film and a manual camera, but this time what I got astounded me.  The reds, oranges, and yellows really showed beautifully, and, when put into vivid mode, created a dazzling effect that you have to see to believe.  This is one of the few times that I have truly loved the vivid option.

<b>My Peeves</b>
There are really very few faults that I can find in this camera.  The screen size is small, but that is understandable.  The user interface can be slightly confusing, but it is not all that complex, and really doesn't take long to figure out.

<b>Conclusion</b>
There aren't many other "beginner" cameras out there that can match this one.  This is especially true when you take into consideration the price.  The numerous features, such as movie mode, that make this camera special, coupled with the Canon name that you know you can trust, make this digital camera a great buy, and a steal at around $200.

If you want to spend a little less money on a digital camera, and still want to get a canon, look at the other cameras in this line.  They are the <a href="/Canon_PowerShot_A200_Cameras"> Canon PowerShot A200</a> and the <a href="/Canon_A100_Digital_Camera__Camera_7638A001AA">Canon PowerShot A100</a>.  The A100 will run you around $160, and the A200 will usually command a price of about $180.
