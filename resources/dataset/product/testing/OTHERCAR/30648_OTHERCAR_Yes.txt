            I�m writing this to all of those who said my little car would leave me dead, if I were ever in an accident. Wrong! Never mind that the car was totaled, I wasn�t.  This is the story of me, and my two little Metros. (Metro #1, 1996 hatchback, #2, 1998 LSI Sedan.)


The little Metro I bought in 1996 was my very first new car. It was the hatchback �egg style� variety. I suffered through the countless pieces of poo poo cars that my dad lovingly provided for me over the years. All the times he had to come rescue me in the wee hours of the morning because I broke a real axle, had a flat tire with no matching spare (that�s another story all together), and other car malfunctions, made me appreciate this little car more than a mentally sound person should.  I had no money saved for a new car, so I gladly traded in an early 90�s Chevy Cavalier that wouldn�t pass California smog certification (cavalier this particular car was not), for a high monthly payment, and a brand new econo egg. 


I was so proud of this car, it being my firstborn. It performed quite well, if you happened to be the only person in the car, and you were of low weight (what else can you expect from 3 cylinders?). This means if you have passengers, don�t expect to have much of a response when you put the pedal to the metal. However, if I was just commuting or doing city driving, I found this car to fit all my needs. This little car can squeeze into the tiniest of parking spaces, and is small enough that even the worst parallel parker can manage. I received excellent gas mileage, an average of 40+ miles per gallon. All in all, I was happy with my purchase, and intended to keep this car until it was paid off, and could trade it in for something more luxurious. 


Then tragedy struck. I was on my way to visit a friend, and made a quick stop at the grocery store to get some beer and snacks. I made the biggest mistake of my car�s life by putting the beer (6 pack, bottles) on the passenger seat, because at the next intersection, a full size pickup ran a red light and smashed the driver�s side of my precious little egg.  I didn�t make the connection that if an accident happens, there is a passenger side air bag, and it would shatter the beer sitting on the passenger seat. I would have walked away from the accident without a scratch, however the air bag caused many tiny pieces of beer bottle to attack my leg. The car was totaled, but that is to be expected when it was hit by a car twice its size.


I had not realized I developed such an attachment to this car, regardless of the fact I was teased by my friends for owning a Metro.  I went right back to the same Chevy dealership and bought Metro #2, this time a more �grown-up� 4 door sedan model. This model is pretty much identical to the 2000 model that is why I feel it fits in this category. Metro #2 has a whole cylinder more than Metro #1, however I cannot feel that much of a power increase. Considering I truly love my cars, I am very bad at maintaining them. If you want a car that you can change the oil, maybe twice a year, this is the car for you. I just got back from the dealership today because my brake warning light was coming on, while making fast left hand turns. It turns out, I never bothered to check the brake fluid level (good thing the brakes still worked). Other than those cause by my own neglect, these two cars have never had any problems.
