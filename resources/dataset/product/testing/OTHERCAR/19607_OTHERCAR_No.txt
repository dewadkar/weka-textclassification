            Immediately after buying the car, I took the car in to get a moonroof leak and a passenger side door creak checked and the dealer said they couldn't find anything wrong.  I felt blown off but mistakenly trusted they had done their best.

I always felt I had been sold a car they knew was defective because when they explained the warranty to me, I asked for examples of the excluded "wearable" parts.  The salesman pointed to the specific spots in the car where the foam liner leaks the worst and mentioned leaks and seepage.  What a coincidence!

After the warranty expired, the problem got worse and my back seat and floor collected puddles of water.

I called the dealership thinking they would have to finally acknowledge the undeniable problem.

At first, an autoshop rep said that they were happy to look at it as I had the extended warranty.  Then, they changed their minds and didn't tell me until the car was brought in and they denied service.  They could have called to tell me but they didn't bother.  It was a huge inconvenience.

Since they didn't want to deal with it, they said they had no record of my bringing the car in for the leaks while still under warranty.

No record?  I had not kept my paper receipt - a mistake I admit due to my youthful inexperience.

So now I have humidity in my car like a rainforest and my windows fog up even when the car is sitting turned off in a parking lot.  I'm concerned about the growth of mold on the carpet and in my air conditioning.

I am very unhappy with Saturn of Woodbridge, Virginia.  Saturn's national customer service only offered to refer me to another Saturn dealership for expensive repairs.

I don't believe that Saturn has great dealerships that are committed to keeping customers happy.

Pros

The Blackberry color (black at night / rich dark wine color in the day) 

Fits me well (I am 5'10'). 

Was in an accident and the construction of the car minimized my personal injuries (I was in passenger seat).  

Able to fit a bicyle in my trunk.  

Fun to buy a Saturn (salesman took my photo and sent me holiday cards for a while).  Very happy for the first year.


Cons

Water leaks 
Other people don't feel comfortable driving my car because of the seat ergonomics / fit 

Bumper scratches really show (they show up white) 

Back seat is majorly uncomfortable and only sits two people (I would rather bypass the cup holders and sit three.) back seat is only really comfortable for children 

Muffler is non-standard only Saturn should provide so more expensive to replace.  

Blind spot when you look over your shoulder to check for cars.  I actually almost cut off some cars a few times.  

Doesn't have power to pick up speed quickly.  

Air conditioning is very weak.

Cannot charge my phone and use my driver side cup holder at the same time because of the position of the lighter outlet.

Passenger side door lock is tricky - sometimes I can unlock it from my side sometimes not.  

I get two FM radio stations and one AM and I live in densely populated Northern Virginia.

The dealer.  The dealer.  The dealer.
