            I personally love my Villager.  My husband I decided that with one child, one big dog, and the 2 of us, we needed something other than our Toyota Camry to get around in.  We travel a lot since all of our family is in another state, and we needed a large vehicle.

I think that as far as mini-vans go, this is the tops.  We travel about six hours one way, and it's like flying in this van.  It is as comfortable as any vehicle you can drive.  As smooth a ride as possible.

As far as convenience, it is wonderful.  The option of removing the seats is wonderful.  Because of our 120 pound dog, we move the back seat forward and he has plenty of room to lay down so he doesn't bother our little one during long trips :)

Even with the back seat moved up, my daughter has plenty of room to stretch her legs without kicking the back of my seat. Also, her car seat fits perfectly without concern for wobbling and shaking.

On top of the other benefits, we have tons of room for all of our luggage without being cramped.  I just think the Villager is tops for families.<br><br>
