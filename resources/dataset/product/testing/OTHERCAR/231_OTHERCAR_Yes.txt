            First off I'll admit I haven't had as much time to work with this camera as I would like to but having purchased it in January here are my impressions so far.  

Negatives the LCD display can become smudged very fast if it is left open and you use the optical viewfinder.  Manual focus can be challenging.  It would be nice if you didn't need an adapter to add a skylight filter to protect the lens.  If you choose to purchase an adapter consider the lensmate adapter as an alternative to the Canon one.  Those who complain the camera is difficult to hold would also benefit from the adapter which allows you to extend finger support under the lens.  It would have been nice if they had included an external AC charger in the box instead of making you purchase a car kit.  I purchased a second battery as well but so far I've yet to use one up between charging cycles.  Some people will consider the special Canon (I've see one or two other vendors offering a replacement) battery pack a negative but it's long life is great.  I opted for the external charger and a CF reader for my PC to avoid wear on the poorly designed cover for the AC adapter and USB connector.  Since I have these items I only opened the cover to connect the AC power while doing a flash upgrade to the system.  The update was easily obtained from the Canon Shureshot web site.  The biggest negative to the camera I've found is that for some reason Canon chose to make the zoom lens zoom between fixed focal lengths rather tan making it one smooth zoom.

The pluses where do I begin?  I came form a film background learned photography on an old 35 mm fully manual range finder eventually moved to then top of the line SLR cameras Olympus OM-1 and OM-2.  I use to shoot a lot of film and did much of my own darkroom work.  My budget is not what it was in those days so the no processing cost and digital darkroom appealed to me.  I really wanted to go with an Olympus digital but was not impressed with their choices when I make the move in December/January.  The only close competitor was the Nikon but I hated it's look and feel.  The G1 looks and feels like a 35 mm camera.  The ability to take it out of the box and start shooting in full auto is great for the novice or for those quick grab shots.  I like the options of aperture or shutter priority or even full manual if you desire.

The ability to use an external flash is great.  No you don't have to use a Canon flash my old Vivitar 385 works just great.  You just have to be willing to work in a manual
aperture mode if you use another brand flash.  Make sure you check the trigger voltage of your flash unit to avoid damage to your G1.  I plan on getting out my old Larson reflectors and setup a multiple flash portrait setup before long.  

I also like the idea of being able to use an IBM microdrive to capture a large number of exposures w/o need to change media.  I have avoided purchasing the microdrive since I found out it is only rated for use up to 9,000 feet.  I live in Colorado and the high country is a favorite place to take pictures.

In short the camera turns out very good quality images with little effort.  If you have the ability it can turn out professional quality images (I've seen them on multiple individuals web sites).  I'm not a pro and my skills are rusty but now I can work on bringing them back without the high film cost.  

You can take it out of the box and the only additional money you really need to spend is for some additional CF modules.  You can also spend as much as you like on add ons like additional batteries, chargers, lens adapters, filters, the list goes on.  This is a camera you won't outgrow too soon.  Perhaps the big minus is this will be old technology before you really feel it has served it's life.

I knew wit my background it was better to spend $1,000 on something I would be happy with than $500-$600 on what was still a point and shoot camera.
