            I've had the misfortune to rent these suckers occasionally and I have to cringe every time I hear the &quot;car that America could build&quot; slogan.
 
It's surprisingly roomy for a compact car and the engine has plenty of power.  The ride is not overly-smooth, but isn't bad either.

The Malibu's gas mileage is above average (22+mpg regardless of driving locale). The cloth interior was unimpressive and the dashboard and moldings were cheap looking.  I found the seats reasonably comfortable, but easily soiled.
 
The problems have to do with the electrical system.  These cars are notorious for electrical problems.  That means not being able to start the cars and wasting hours jump starting batteries that are actually fine.  Some coworkers and I were constantly having the rental car company come out where we were working and replacing these less than impressive machines.


Even though the Malibu is a lower priced model in Chevrolet's line the low quality and shoddy craftsmanship I experienced would lead me to discourage any potential buyers.  Also, be sure not buy these cars from AutoNation.  They get them from the rental car lots and like I said, those are bad news.<br><br>
