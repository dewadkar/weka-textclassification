            Living in the UK I expect that my perception of the 900 is very different to that of the US buyer. I read somewhere that it was marketed in America as a small car!

By British standards this is a very big car, difficult to park and the 2 litre turbocharged engine is heavy on petrol, less of a concern where fuel is cheaper.

Despite its enormous weight it is a very responsive car to drive and beautifully balanced to give a feeling of lightness. The chassis is stiff, the suspension is a touch on the firm side, but this and the steering which is crisp and light gives excellent feedback from the road, although it would be wise to avoid early 900s without power steering,  more a car for the driver than the passenger.

The only downside from the driver's point of view is the slightly sticky gearbox.

The light pressure turbo version that I own does not have that noticable 'slam in the back' boost of the full turbo, but enables the heavy car to accelerate swiftly from any sensible speed, although it is capable of 125 MPH flat out.

Parts are reasonably expensive as is main dealer servicing, but engine access is good and routine maintenance is easy. I have had no major problems in the last 50,000 miles since I've owned the car. It has now done 125,000 miles, 200,000 mile 900s are not rare.

With the seats folded down there is enough space inside to transport just about anything.

Paint, Trim and interior are all very good quality and very hardwearing my car has no rust despite the English climate.
The SAAB 900's safety record is extremely good, but it comes from the 'obliterate anything it hits' rather than the more modern 'crumple zone' school of thought.

This car was produced from 1979 'til 1993 and underwent many evolutive improvements, late 900s are less stylish looking but mechanically more advanced, they even had ABS from 1991.
