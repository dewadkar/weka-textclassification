            After ruining my Kodak 260 digital camera on vacation with a thermos of coffee we set out shopping for a new camera.  The Kodak brand was ruled out as I was very disappointed with Kodak's customer service and exorbitant charges to repair the old camera.  

The Sony DSC-S70 satisfied all of the features I was looking for which were as follows:

1.  Produce a clear crisp picture that could be enlarged without loss of quality or distortion. The Sony has features for additional settings for night photos, and others which I have not yet mastered, but are there for the opportunity to use.

2.  A/C power adaptor to use in order to save on the battery life for both taking photos and for processing the download of photos into computer.

3.  Availability of accessories, especially spare batteries (in this case a lithium battery is required).  Some digital cameras that were removed from our possible list to purchase were due to only being available in camera stores or online.

4.  Sony has great technical support and was appreciated.  Windows 98 seems to be a requirement.  My old computer had Windows 98 over Windows 95 and would not work.  Sony support spent many hours in trying to make it work.  A new computer was in order anyway, and the speed of a picture download is amazing.

5.  All of the features such as redeye reduction, flash, adjustment of the size of resolution of the picture is tremendous and the easy of the menu are all excellent.

6.  A camera that would satisfy our needs for many years.

If the movie feature is important I would suggest before purchasing the camera a person look at it in the store prior to purchase.  It is not the best quality when downloaded.  If enlarged on the monitor it has too many pixels showing for good quality.  It is there for fun only in my opinion.

If choosing today I would still purchase the same camera.
