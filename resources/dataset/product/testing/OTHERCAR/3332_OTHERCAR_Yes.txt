            Wanted a 4x4 for the wife.  Have had the Bravada for three years and have had only one problem with it and the dealer took care of it and even loan me a free loaner car for a day and a half.  It handles well in all types of weather. Has good power to pass.  The only thing that I do not like is the hump in the right front floor.  The seat up front are very big and you can sit in them all day.  The AC radio and everything works very well.  I am trading it in on a new 2000 model this week.  And if I have as good luck with it as the 1997 I will be very happy again with the Olds Bravada.  A lot of room for two in the back maybe a little small for three on a long trip.  Easy to fold down the back seats and I like the split rear 60\40 seats.  Leather is great!!!  You get a lot of extra for the cost of the unit.  I like it a lot that is way I am buying a new 2000 next week.  Test drive it and you will fall in love with it.  Much better then the Ford and Jeep...
