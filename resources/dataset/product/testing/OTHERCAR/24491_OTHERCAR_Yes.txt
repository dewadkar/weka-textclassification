            For most people, this camera is a luxury, not a necessity.  The only people who really need a $1000 digital camera that stores high quality images on rewritable CD's are those whose profession or hobby requires them to take more than 150 very high quality photos at a time, and to have the option of printing those photos in sizes up to 8x10 directly from a CD.  Note that all of these conditions must be met for you to honestly say that you need this camera.

Of course, man (or woman) does not live by need alone.  And this camera is a really impressive luxury which causes total strangers to start conversations with you by saying, "Is that the kind of camera that stores photos on CD's?"

So, even if the conditions listed in the first paragraph don't apply to your situation, don't hesitate to buy this camera if you have an interest in photography and you can afford it.  This is particularly true if you are computer savvy and want to display images on the Internet.  There is no camera that I know of that is easier to work with in conjunction with a computer.

Unlike most people who become interested in photography and then buy a camera, I became interested in photography because of the camera.  The very first time I saw it advertised, I realized it was the perfect item to help me tie together my three special interests, animals, zoos, and website development.

Obviously, I am not an expert on cameras in general. For your convenience I have copied the camera's technical specs directly from the Sony website and included them at the end of this review, but I have no idea what most of what I copied means.

However, after using the Sony Mavica CD300 an average of four hours per week for almost a year, and taking more than 75 photos per hour, I am definitely qualified to comment on this camera's ease of use and durability.

IS THIS CAMERA EASY TO USE?  NOT BAD, ONCE YOU LEARN THE USES OF ALL THE SETTINGS, AND HOW TO SET THEM.

People who are familiar with digital cameras should have no trouble learning how to use this camera.  People who have never used digital cameras will have to learn by playing around with the camera (which is actually the best way to learn almost any new skill) because the manual is not much help.

The manual was obviously written by Japanese writers who were consulting a pocket Japanese-English dictionary.  Fortunately, diagrams and illustrations are not language-specific, so many of the ones in the manual are useful.

I was able to learn the basics by playing around with the camera for an hour.  During that time, I took 120 very high quality, mostly very good photos of my cat.  (Some were just of his tail or of one of his ears, but that was not the fault of the camera.)

The view on the LCD screen, and the set-up features and menus that appear on the screen when you press the menu bar or set the mode dial to set-up are easy to see.

You do need good thumb coordination and two available hands to pop open the camera to remove or replace the CD.  And the tiny buttons, dials, and levers are the same color as the camera body, so if your eyesight is less than perfect, it is helpful if your finger tips are sensitive enough to detect buttons, dials and levers by feel.

And the camera can feel a little heavy if you have the strap around your neck for long periods without holding the camera up with your hands to take photos.

IS THIS CAMERA DURABLE?  YES INDEED!

During the year that I have been using my Sony Mavica CD300, I have given it a rigorous workout.

I have taken almost 15,000 photos on a total of three rewritable CD's which I reformat to use again after transferring the photos to CD-R's. 

I have used this camera in temperatures ranging from 20 degrees to 105 degrees.  I have dropped it twice on cement, and once almost thrown it at a zebra who was attempting to stomp on some ducklings.  (Fortunately, the zebra missed the terrified ducklings, and the camera strap stopped the camera from hurtling through the air.  The camera, and my neck, did get a jolt, though.)

And, through it all, the camera still works like new!


WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS CAMERA:

I like this camera because it lived up to my expectations.  It has served the purpose for which I bought it. (See paragraph 4 above).

I love the image quality.  I usually set the camera to take the highest quality, largest image size photos, but even on the standard or e-mail settings, the images are very good quality.

I like being able to delete photos immediately when they don't turn out well.  Even though this doesn't always regain space on the disc (see paragraph 3 in the "WHAT I DON'T LIKE ..." section), I save time that I would have had to spend later when I am looking through the photos with a photo-editing program.

I really like the "burst" feature that allows you to take three shots in rapid sequence with one button press.

I like the fact that you are given the option of AUTO or MANUAL on most settings.  This allows me to learn how to use the various features a little at a time. As I learn more about photography, I am able to make manual settings correctly in unusual situations.  In the meantime, the automatic settings work extremely well in most circumstances.

I also really like the AF illuminator which lights up the subject and the area around the subject so the camera can focus on it in areas with poor lighting.  The AF illuminator works well with the twilight scene selection to take photos in moonlight, and, of course, in twilight.

WHAT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THIS CAMERA, BUT DON'T DISLIKE ENOUGH TO MAKE ME GIVE IT A NEGATIVE REVIEW:

Zoom, you call this zoom?  As I said before, I am not an expert on camera technicalities, but 3X optical zoom is apparently not enough to bring subjects as close as I would like.

I would say that I don't like the fact that you have to buy the Sony CD's made especially for this camera for reliable performance, but the three that I have been using have worked so well through so many reformats that I guess they are worth the price ($10 each). 

I don't like the fact that you don't regain any CD space if you delete images other than the last one you took.  Once you delete the last photo you took, you can then delete the one you took prior to that and so forth.  But if you want to keep the most recent one taken, you don't regain any disc space by deleting other images.

I am not too impressed with the moving images I have taken with this camera.  The images are too small.

I don't like the variation in recording time.  Most of the time, the recording time is satisfactory, but sometimes it is very slow.

My only other complaint is that the battery has to be inside the camera while it is being charged.  Since I have two spare batteries, I would like to be able to be charging one battery while using the camera.


HELPFUL TIPS:

Hold the camera upright and steady while it is recording, and especially while it is deleting files.

To save battery life, use low or no flash.  If you set the AF illuminator to ON, you will be surprised how often you don't need a flash.

Don't test your camera by dropping it on cement just because I said mine survived being dropped twice.  I did it accidentally as I was taking it out of the case.  (Fortunately, the lens cap was still on.)
