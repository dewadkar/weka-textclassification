            We bought the 95 Corsica because our 81 Plymouth was on the fritz. I always like the style of the Corsica so when we needed a new car, I wanted to look at the Corsica too. We also looked at the Ford Contour, the Saturn SL and the Plymouth Breeze. We did not like the console in the Ford, or Plymouth. We didn't like the very low to the ground feeling in the Saturn.

The Seats in the Corsica are comfortable (even for a 9 month pregnant woman). I liked the drivers seat recline positions. We have been spoiled my the auto light feature where the lights go on and off when needed. We don't ever leave them on by accident or leave them off while driving. It also has the DRL (Daytime Running Lamps) That is nice for safety and it is not noticeable from in the car at all.

The 2.2l engine sufficient and quiet. It is very low maintenance, we just give it oil changes. The Oil filter is in a very difficult place to change at the rear of the engine. We had to bring it in for changes for a long time until I found someone to help me find it.

We did have to put new tires on because the originals were so bad they made noise and made the car vibrate. There is a clip for the center console and it broke, so even though it stays down with gravity, I think they could have used a stronger latch.

The interior light stays on after you close the doors and that is nice so that you can find the keyhole or whatever you want for about 20 seconds, then it fades away. 

The trunk pass through is a nice feature it allows the small car to make trips to the lumber yard without having to leave the trunk open or boards sticking out a window.

The ABS system works well, but if you don't use the car and it is real foggy out (damp)the brakes do tend to grab until they get warm and dried off.

This is a good car for a YOUNG small family. I stress the young, because there is not a whole lot of back seat leg room. It will hold 5 people though if necessary. It is also a good car for an older couple, because it is easy to maneuver, is inexpensive to operate and all of the controls are easy to reach.<br><br>
