            I have had a couple of weeks to play around with this camera and my view is as follows:

The lag time it takes before and between taking pictures is poor at best.  Many lost moments because of this delay.

I have a problem with the lens cap.  Very often as I am sure many of you have done, I turn the camera on with the lens cap still in place. It sounds like the lens is pushing into the cover which does not secure to the lens itself.  This straining sound is followed by an alarm that indicates the lens cap has not been removed.  My question is how much strain is being placed on the lens mechanics when this happens.

The camera should have the protective plastic films that are common for most electronics devices.  Very easy to scratch the display surfaces.

Although I did not purchase this camera for the video feature, the audio is slightly out of sinc with video
during playback.

The popout display is great if you are viewing with the camera at your waist line.  It cannot be used if the camera is above your head.

The max ISO is 400.  Would have been nice to see 600, 800, 1000 

I wanted to outline the poor features of the camera because there was alot less to write than all the good features.  When these cameras develop the SLR features at a more reasonable cost, we will have something good.  I would give my right arm to see a true manual focus lens on one of these cameras. 

The price looks to be in balance with it's features.

My next purchase won't be until they have all the same featurs as an SLR at a reasonable cost.

A great camera for family get togethers, outings, etc. but not for the serious photographer.
