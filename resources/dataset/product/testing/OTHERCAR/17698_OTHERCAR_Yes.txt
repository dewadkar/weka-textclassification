            I just purchased a 2000 SL2.  My first car was a 1991 SL2 which currently has 207,000 miles.  My first car still runs great.  In the ten years I've had it, I've changed the catalytic converter and the slave cylinder in addition to maintenance (brakes, timing chain, etc.)  But those are the only repairs I've had!  (It still has the original clutch!!)  Also, this car has NEVER not started.

I really wanted to keep driving the first car forever, but this spring the AC needed charging and I decided that I really deserved a _new_ car. So far, I like my new one almost as much as my old one... (but the old one I like just a tad bit more..) 

There's a lot of changes between the 1991 and the 2000 car.  The 2000 feels huge inside.  Strangely enough, I can't see any of the outside of the car when I'm driving.  The clear coat on the new car seems to show small scratches a lot easier than my old one, but maybe that's just because it's brand new and a darker color than my old car.  

My old car also had more torque and felt more powerful when you initially stepped on the gas.  The standard transmission in the new car is much more forgiving than the one in my old car.  

I did look at other brands of cars before I bought the new Saturn, but truly I think the cost of the Saturn is better than any comparable cars.  Currently they are offering a 4.9% APR which brings my monthly payment to 301$.  

As far as space, the back seat is pretty big!  My cello fits easily in the back seat!  3 adults can fit back there, although I wouldn't try to cram three people in there for too long, it's not THAT big!  

Also, the people at the Saturn dealers have always been up front with me about repairs and costs, which I truly respect.  <br><br>
