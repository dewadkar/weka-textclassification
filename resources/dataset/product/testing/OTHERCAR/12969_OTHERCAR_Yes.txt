            The camera Casio QV-2800UX has appeared a little bit later than 3000-th model. And many had problem: what to select: 3000, 2800 or 2300? With QV-2300 it is clear, 2-megapixel matrix, whose functional and optical possibilities approximately correspond to 3000-th, however size of a frame at it, naturally, it is less. Argument to its favor can be only habit to work with a turning screen. As to cameras QV-3000 and QV-2800, if first is a camera of common assignment, it is possible to name second as the camera of special assignment. It means, that there are problems, which 2800 will make better, despite of a smaller matrix.

What integrates.
Sensitivity at cameras is identical. Both cameras are universal devices of reading of maps of memory CF through USB. There is a possibility of management from the computer through the serial port, but this reaching not firm Casio ("free programmers"). And, certainly, manufacturer of matrixes - firm Sony, only in one case - ICX 252AQ, and in the second - ICX 284AQA. Accordingly, and filters before sensing elements: green, blue and red.

What difference.
First of all are possibilities and style of shooting. The receptions of work with the camera are largely determined by the viewfinder. At Casio QV-2800UX on all cases of life only one LCD-screen. It is used and as the viewfinder, and for out of all information. Additional LCD for the control information at this camera is not present. 

What still is at 2800 that is not present at 3000? Sync contact for connection of an external flash (at 3000 external flash can be synchronized only on a light pulse), the thread �43 under light filters, built-in timer for shooting in specific time, console in a package. The camera allows to do separate shots on a command of the computer and to transfer an image after each shot with any focal length of optics.

The presence of a thread, though also not so standard, �43, essentially expands possibilities of the camera. Using additional accessories, you can some more in two times increase and so unsmall range of a modification of a focal length. Thus, if you can approach to object on an optimum distance, 3-mexapixel camera, certainly, will give better quality of photos, however if to such possibility is not given, native optics and 2-megapixel matrix will give essentially better quality. However, it is necessary to notice, that with maximum focal length at this is camera on edges of a frame are appreciable chromatic aberrations.

With an information about parameters of shooting when you view photos obvious progress too is observed. Now you can see, in what mode and what significance's of endurance and diaphragm, balance white and method of sampling of an exposition the frame is made.

And here with switching of a mode of a focussing, on my sight, there was an annoying misunderstanding. At QV-3000 when pressing a button the search of modes in the following order happens: auto, manual focussing, infinity, macro, and at QV-2800UX all on the contrary: auto, macro, infinity, manual focussing. It seemed, trifle, however you are deprived with a possibility to record a focussing selected by auto, as the transition from an automatic focussing on macro knocks down all automated installations, and, eventually, when you will proceed on a manual focussing, it is necessary go from zero, instead of from a position selected by auto.
