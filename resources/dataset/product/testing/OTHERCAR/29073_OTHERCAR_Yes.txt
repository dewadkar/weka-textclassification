                i purchased a 1992 wrangler in september of 2001 for about 
 $7500, not counting my trade in. i live in pittsburgh, so the natural terrain is extremely hilly, and we get about 4 - 5 months of snow a year. affter being burned by the old front wheel drive is good in the snow lie, sure my daytone moved alittle more than my camaro, but both rendered me useless on moments notice due to weather. the best word i can think of to describe my wrangler is " tank"......

     a quick sordid accident history.

first of all it came with some dings i can't explain...

then there was the deer at about thirty five mph in the snow. his rack scratched the paint on the hood, but he took all the damage. big deer too.

then i got rearended on a main road when a parked car pulled a u-ey into on coming traffic. the jeep stopped on a dime, the minivan behind me was not so lucky. his bumper and grille were distroyed, and his hood bent to a 90 degree angle, my jeep's suffered virtually no damage, the steel bumberette was bent a little. thats all.

a neighbors car slid down the hill i live on and into the front of my jeep just last week. smashed out her headlight bezel and turn signal but not a mark to see on my jeep and it's black. that shows everything. 

mine is a 4.0 standard. i would suggest going with a stick shift, it's a very heavy vehicle and the extra control on the gears is helpfull. also it considerately takes down on brake usage and helps you stop alot easier. 

the 4 wheel drive is a seperate stick next to the shifter. all you have to do is drop it into neutral and pull the other stick, then put it back in gear and your on your way. usually when you need the four whell drive you can't get to the hubs to lock them easily, like when your driving, so this helps alot over other 4x4's.

it's a bumpy ride, but that goes without saying. it's a jeep. yj's have leaf springs, later models smoothed out with coils, but thats preference.

mines a tank in the snow on these hills. a might cold inside but worth it for the safe trip.

i have replaced the universal joint twice, but at about $15 bucks each time. i did it myself in a driveway, so it's not a big job. 

i know the clutch was replaced before i bought it about 2.5 years ago. what i believe is the slave cylider in the clutch is giving me problems already. i never had a problem with it before though. reverse grinds if you don't clear it in a forward gear, but it's smooth if you do. 

the biggest difference between a jeep and about everything else i have ever driven is how you sit. straight up and down, like a dining room chair. but you can see alot from up there. my range of veiw is very wide. you can see good out of the soft top windows as long as you wash it regularly. which is good cause the skin around the zippered windows renders the side mirrors ...... not useless, but none too usefull. but the windows are tall and with how high you sit it's easy to see.

the wheels are at the outer corners of the body which makes cornering nice and tight. the jeeps are easily flippable story only applies to pre chrsler jeeps. my yj stands wide, with 30inch tire, they have never left the ground. except on jacks, but thats a given.

if your a wuss about being cold and you live in a wintry area i woundn't suggest a jeep, unless you can deal with it to be able to enjoy a beautiful summer night with the top down. i had a convertible once but it doesn't compare with how open a jeep can be. 

with some cool rims, some aftermarket stainless steel parts, and a different top you can dress a jeep up into a very custom looking vehicle relatively cheapely. and they make everything aftermarket for jeeps. you can turn it into anything you want. a crome grille cover looks good on any jeep.

the four litre engine is well matched for the jeep. it's mighty, but not overly for everyday driving. if you get a four bager one i would suggest getting the stick to help balance it, but a straight six cylinder four litre is the way to go.

personally i like the bare metal floors and stripped down dash of a yj wrangler. 
carpet sets are abundant though and easy to install.

all in all.....

i feel safe in my jeep. which is good cause for some reason people like to run into it.
