            As my government office went digital, we were faced with a decision on the type of digital photography equipment to buy.  I pushed for the Mavica (Which won over other systems) after using an FD-73 a friend had.  It's best selling point:  Simplicity.  Turn it on, slip in a disk (just like having film), point and shoot.  Out of film?  slip in a disk.  Want to see the picture?  Preview on the back or slip the disk into the computer and open the file, NO Hassles.  The ease of using floppy disk is the greatest selling point.  No proprietary cords, memory sticks, software, etc...  The floppy opens under Internet explorer or a host of photo and graphics programs easily.  User options for brightness and contrast are easy to follow on the rear screen menu, it has good battery life, and the zoom feature is ok.  As the baseline for the series, the low resolution is not the greatest, but it's versatility is impressive.<br><br>
