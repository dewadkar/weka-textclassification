            Last Spring my wife and I purchased a 1999 Chevy Blazer.  It was a lease SUV with 17,000 miles.  We were not looking for something with a lot of added features but the one that we ended up with was loaded with everything.  Both of us have come to really appreciate the Blazer.  It is a very nice vehicle.  It is the right size to get in and out of traffic and is easy to park.  It has a lot of power and shifting to four wheel drive is a touch of the button.  When we started looking at Blazers we found that the seats were too low.  So, we had to concentrate our search for a Blazer that had dual power seats.  This solved the problem and we love our purchase.  As to the down side, there are a couple of items to note.  The turning radius is not tight enough.  It should be designed to turn shorter.  In many situations we have to stop, back up and turn again to make a tight turn.  I do not understand why it has such a shallow turning radius.  The other item is the gas mileage.  I know SUV's are not big on gas mileage but we get around 19mpg.  I think for a small SUV it should get better gas mileage<br><br>
