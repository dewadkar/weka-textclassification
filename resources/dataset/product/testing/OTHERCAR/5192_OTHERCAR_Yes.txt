            Buying the Honda Accord 2-dr. coupe was the best thing we have ever done!

We needed to buy a car and decided that we should buy a new one since we would be putting many, many miles on it.  My husband wanted something reliable and comfortable, but with power.  I wanted something that looked good - not a family car.  We both wanted something not too expensive and that would last a long time.  After shopping around for a while, we kept coming back to the Accord coupe.  I was shocked, after all it was an Accord - you know, that practical, mid-sized family car that everyone owns - but this one was hot!  So, we test drove it.  It rode so smoothly and got up to speed so quickly that we thought we were in a much more expensive car.  We were sold! After working out the price, we took it home.

Now, it's even better than we thought.  It handles very well, needs very little maintenance (so far), and even reminds you when it's due for an oil change or tune up (a little light on the dash).  The one downfall is that the back seat is very small, especially behind the driver.  This isn't normally a problem, since we have no kids, but occasionally we need to pile more people into the car, and then it's a bit cramped.  

Overall, I love this car, and so does my husband.  Even on the 14 hour road trip back home, it's a peach!  However if you use your back seat a lot, you should probably consider the 4-door variety. <br><br>
