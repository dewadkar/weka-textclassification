            I bought a used '94 Sunbird with 125,000miles for just $1700.00.  The original owner put alot of highway miles going 4 hours one way back and forth to work.  He did a great job keeping this car clean because the interior and exterior are like new.  The only problem is that all that mileage has worn out the front struts, but I can get them replaced for about $200.  The car has a sunroof and a spoiler and is that weird green/blue with red pinstriping.  I think that the 2.0L OHC runs great and the 5spd manual transmission is fun to drive.  I also like getting ABS brakes WITHOUT having to get airbags!!!  All in all, I feel like I got a car that is very late model like while paying a junker price.  Even if something breaks in the next year or two I am way ahead of the game.
