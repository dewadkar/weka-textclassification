            Great little camera but it is just that.  Let me clarify myself, I purchased the Toshiba PDR-M60 (2.3 megapixel cam priced at $399) and returned it for the Sony DSC-S30 (1.3 megapixel cam priced at $399) because the Toshiba's body felt cheap!  The Sony cam feels sturdy and durable (see my opinion on the Toshiba PDR-M60).
But now I have to tell myself, you bought a camera for the pictures not the body.  The Sony DSC-S30 can't even come close to the output of the Toshiba PDR-M60.  The picture quality is much clearer and the colors are much more vivid in the Toshiba than in the Sony.  In low light situations, such as in the house at night the Toshiba produces images that require little touchup in software.  However the Sony consistently casts a yellow hue or produces dark images in every photo I have taken in doors at night, possibly because the flash does not seem to be strong enough.  However in daylight conditions the images are wonderful and comparable with the Toshiba.  
The Sony DSC-S30 does have numerous features the Toshiba did not like the rechargeable battery, a definite plus.  The DSC-S30 also has a larger view screen and more on camera edit features than the Toshiba.  
But as far as quality of image the Sony DSC-S30 does not compare to the Toshiba PDR-M60.  
So here is my dilemma now, I am returning my Sony DSC-S30 for the Sony DSC-S50 (2.1 megapixel cam priced at $599) in hopes that I can get the same quality image as the Toshiba.  Even though I favor the Toshiba PDR-M60, I can not get over the cheap quality of the body of the camera and would rather spend the extra $200 for a more durable camera.  Or at least that's what I think now, I'll have to see what kind of images it produces (see my opinion on the Sony DSC-S50 later this week).  On another note, people have complained about the lack of view finder on the Sony, I live in Florida and have used this camera outside on bright sunny days.  I found the screen to be easy to use outside even in bright sunny conditions.  Plus the rechargeable batteries are wonderful and will cut down on trips to your local Walgreens to purchase AA batteries every week or two!    
My conclusion, if you are going to spend $399 on a digital camera, nothing compares to the images you get from the Toshiba PDR-M60.  However you have to be able to stomach the &quot;I'm gonna break on you&quot; feeling.  I could not so I went with the Sony DSC-S30 for the same price and was not happy with indoor performance, but quite happy with outdoor performance.  A good camera for techies or gadget guys who value features rather than all around image quality.
