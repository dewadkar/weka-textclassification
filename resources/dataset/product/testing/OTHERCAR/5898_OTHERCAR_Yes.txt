            After doing many hours of research into pick-up trucks, I decided on a 98 Ram SLT 4X4 with an extended cab.  I am still extremely happy with my decision, for I have had no major problems with the vehicle.  The only minor problem to speak of is a difficulty getting it into 4L.  since this is not a spur of the moment action, it does not present a problem.  My gas mileage has improved by 2mpg as the engine has broken in.

This is a big truck.  I don't advise that it be bought for average use for it is difficult to park.  Fitting into most parking garages is a tricky process also.  I do suggest that anyone looking for a powerful, great looking vehicle for hauling or towing purchase this vehicle.

The ride is smooth and quiet.  The standard speaker system is not the best, but it does a decent job regardless.  The center console is indispensable both as a storage area and arm rest.<br><br>
