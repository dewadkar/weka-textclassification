            The Chevy Venture was one of the most enjoyable vans I have ever driven.  On a trip to Las Vegas, we had this vehicle for almost a week and traveled hundreds of miles which resulted in very comfortable riding and even more fun driving.

There were six of us on the trip and more than enough room.  The passengers were very comfortable and the trunk area was more than sufficient to hold our cooler, three suitcases, and a huge bag of snacks and other miscellaneous items.

As I drove, I often didn't realize how fast we were going because it was so smooth that it didn't feel like 90 miles!  Of course, I slowed down but it was such an enjoyable driving experience at any speed.  There was so much room as well.  We totally enjoyed the dual sliding doors, no one had to wait to exit the van which added convenience and comfort again.  

In addition, the driver &amp; passenger seats were full size and all of them reclined and were ultra comfortable.  There was also a built in CD player and speakers which added more pleasure to the ride.  Also, the air conditioning and/or heat could be turned on either in the front or rear of the van for more convenience and comfort.  The compass was great, too.

Later we drove a Voyager and there was just no comparison.  It was more difficult to drive and we could feel almost every single bump, unlike the Chevy Venture.  We would very much like to own this van, but money is an issue at the present time so it will be at least another year before we can purchase one.  

We are interested in the Warner Bros. version, but I'm not sure that would be totally safe because it may be distracting to have a VCR going at the same time that I'm driving.  I'm not opposed to this, given that my children are older, but perhaps I would get distracted if there were a good movie on.  Nevertheless, I like the capability and all the extras of the Chevy Venture and look forward to eventually purchasing one.<br><br>
