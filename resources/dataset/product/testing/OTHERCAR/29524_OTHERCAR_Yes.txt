            I have owned this camera for 6 months and not had any problems with it.  I had heard about the bright light blurry pics problem, but apparently Kodak has corrected the issue.  I've taken pics in all light conditions, including some neon light pics in very low light without a tripod, and all rival a midrange 35mm.  I especially love the optical zoom feature, and the ease of picture taking.  
Batteries last a long time, if you don't leave the LCD screen on.  It is really unnecessary to do so, and only sucks the batteries down.  Very easy to check the pic after taken, as the camera has a feature which turns the screen on automatically after the shutter snaps, and then turns off after about 3 seconds (can be disabled).  Camera ships with a set of rechargeable batteries and a charger.  All you really need beyond what comes with the camera is a case.  
The 8mb card standard in the camera will hold about 32 pics on the quality setting that is one under the best.  I have been able to enlarge these pics to 5x7 without noticeable jaggies even on this quality setting.
Camera is easy to hold and not overly heavy, even with the batteries.

I can and do recommend this to hobbyists such as myself.  While it may not have all the settings of the top line digital cams, it has more than enough, and a great price for your average user.
