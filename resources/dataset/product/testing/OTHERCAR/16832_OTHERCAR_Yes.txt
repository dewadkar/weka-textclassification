            This car is very sporty and has a lot of power we had a Z28 model a boy was it fun to drive. It had great acceleration and considering that we live in Michigan it had pretty good traction. Some features I really like were the electronic convertible top the glass rear windshield and the sound system. I thought that the electronic top was a really nice feature and one you put down the top there was a cover to put over the top to make it look like a more expensive car like a mercedes or BMW. The glass windshield also seemed a lot more classy then one of those plastic rear windshields<br><br>
