            Even without the car, the movie Harold and Maude had a lot of things going for it. Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon brought the black comedy to life and helped create a film that says a lot about life and how to live it.

But then there�s the car�..

At one point in the movie Harold (Bud Cort) takes a blowtorch to a black Jaguar XKE and when he is done, the XKE is a two-seater hearse. BMW has brought this car to life with the Z3 Coupe body style. Everyone knows what the Z3 convertible looks like and from the windshield forward, the coupe looks just like it. And from the windshield back it looks like a miniature two-door station wagon. The M version of the coupe adds extra wide wheels in the back that fill the ample fender flares.

Why first talk about styling in a sports car? Because the M coupe�s retro styling is so striking. Because it is like nothing else out there on the road. Because the image of this styling sets the tone of this car. Make no mistake -- it is an ugly car. But this is a hulking, no-nonsense ugly. This is an ugly that draws the eye and says to the viewer: �this car is built for speed.�

And looks are not deceiving here. BMW has put the 240hp 3.2liter M engine into the 3000lb coupe and given it a suspension that can put that power to the ground. The acceleration in the car is blazing, running easily to sixty in less than six seconds and pulling all the way up to an electronically limited top speed of 137mph. The brakes are outstanding and give you the confidence that they will get you out of trouble. And the even weight balance, the rear wheel drive, the tight steering and the taut suspension make the car feel as comfortable turning as going straight. The car is a joy to drive fast.

But this car can get you into trouble with both the laws of the road and the laws of physics. The car feels stable and rooted at 100mph and the engine is ready to pull from 65mph to the 90mph � 100mph range without effort. Police officers usually take driving over 25mph over the speed limit seriously. Have a good time trying to explain it.

BMW knows that the laws of physics can be a problem in the car. They provide a switchable electronic mechanism to keep the driver out of trouble under extreme driving conditions that will back off the throttle or gently apply the brakes to keep the car on the road. But take this car fast into a turn and get hard on the brakes or the throttle and sit back and enjoy the sight of the rear end of the car coming around and passing you. Oh it is much harder to do with the electronic guardian turned on, but this is a car that will snap oversteer and will leave you with nothing to do but hang on.

Inside, the car remains true to its function and form. The car is a BMW and has the comfortable, well thought out, and understated interiors that BMW makes. The retro look from the outside is carried to the inside with analog gauges surrounded by chrome. It is carried all the way to the point of having an analog clock instead of a digital one.

I own a black 2000 M Coupe that looks just like a miniature hearse and I love it for the reasons above. The styling and the driving are all-important to me and were the reasons that I purchased the car. It is a joy to drive. 

And there were some bonuses. I am tall (6�2�) and I fit into the car with plenty of headroom. Two-seater sports cars are often lacking on luggage space but the hearse-like back of the car provides a surprising amount of space. Enough for two to easily take an extended weekend trip, or for two sets of golf clubs. And it is comfortable for both driver and passenger.

There are also some problems. The optional sunroof is a silly tilting translucent sunroof that does not have a cover and does not slide back. And you would think that a car this expensive would have a good air conditioner. On the contrary, the air conditioner is often only adequate when the car in on the expressway and up to speed. Surely a car that is black both inside and outside (and also has a sunroof) does not help this. But then I live in a fairly temperate part of the world where days over 90 degrees are unusual. The sound of radio is not great. The rear latch seems to break easily such that it must always be unlocked with a key. Finally, part of the reason that there is so much space in the back is that BMW�s idea of a spare tire for this car is some sort of strange foam spewing box that will surely not help me if a tire shreds. But then what choice did they have with differently sized wheels front and back?

These problems do not dominate my thinking about the car. I bought the car first for the way it drives and second for the way it looks. I am pleased that I can also take trips in the car and that it is reasonably comfortable. And I don�t really mind the other oddities. The M Coupe is quite a car. It draws attention and it goes like hell. And that�s what I wanted.
