            I would hope that if you are in the market for a new automobile, you take it in serious consideration before you purchase a 1997 Pontiac Sunfire. I have had problems with mine since I drove it off the lot. I have taken the car into the shop almost once a month since I have owned it. I had to replace struts and brakes on this within the first year of owning it. I have also had problems with screws and small parts of the interior falling a part from normal use.

 I feel as though the car should have been engineered better. I have a spoiler on the back of mine, and when it rains or snows and you open the trunk the water that is caught up under the spoiler drips directly into the trunk. The windows in the sunfire are also not big enough, this cause me to have a hard time seeing out of the back windows. I have also ruined speakers in this car many times, without cranking up the stereo that loud. 

Another engineering flaw that made it difficult to like this car was were the shifter is there are no gear lights on the shifter, they are all on the dash. Making it confusing to figure out what gear you are in. I would only recommend this car to people who are planning to drive to work and back. Journey in this car shouldn't be more than 15 mins. Overall I hate this automobile. <br><br>
