            My wife and I purchased our 97 Bonneville SE new.  We love this car for road trips.  In the first year alone we put on about 20,000 miles.  The V-6 puts out more than enough power and the handling has been great.  The leather seats are very comfy for the long haul.  The automatic temperature control is wonderful, although I wished we had gotten dual climate control.  I do regret ordering the sunroof, however, as we tend not to use it much and it's an expensive option.

On the down side, we've had it in the shop for about 3 times, all out of warranty of course.  Inexplicably, the power steering pump went out at 39,000 miles.  That cost us almost $700.  Second, we hit something with our power antenna, so I had to get that repaired to the tune of about $100.  Lastly, a battery cable somehow went bad causing us to replace the battery.

Overall, we've been happy with the car despite the mechanical problems.  <br><br>
