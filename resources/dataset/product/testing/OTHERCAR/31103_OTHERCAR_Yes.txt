            The Jeep Cherokee Sport is a great all around vehicle.  They are so many new types of sport utility vehicles on the road today, but the jeep cherokee is the orginal SUV.  It is the perfect size for running around town and going on trips.

When I was looking to buy a new car, I wanted to try every type of dealership around.  I wanted a SUV that was reasonable in price, looked sporty, drove great, pretty good on gas, easy to get around in, and had cargo room.I test drove a Honda CRV, Kia Sportage, Toyota Rav4, Jeep Cherokee, and a Ford Explorer.  I fell in love with the Jeep Cherokee right away, it was everything I was looking for.  The Ford Explorer came very close, but it reminded me more of a family car and I'm still young.

I bought a 1997 Cherokee sport and that was the year they updated the Cherokee.  The interior was redesigned and the suspension was changed to quadra-coil.  The electrical system was reconfigured to cause less small elelectrical problems.  The exterior had some changes to make it look sleeker.  It had always been a good vehicle, but now it was even better.
