            Chrysler LHS

I have spent a significant amount of time in the LHS, and will try to give as much detail as I can.

Exterior: 9/10

The LHS is Chrysler's new age robo-styling, which is love it or hate it.  Stick with the LHS as it subtracts the granny-glasses headlamps of the 300M.  Still, the funky square grille in the front is a bit odd.  The two cars are similar anyway.  The LHS has a very low-slung profile with smooth, aggresive lines and an upscale appearance.  The back end is clean and pretty, with a spiffy chromed dual exhaust pipe.  The LHS also sports extra-beefy Goodyear performance tires on standard 17" aluminum alloy wheels, which have a cool pattern even though their painted (a bit odd-seeming).  The car is big, but not too big.  And the cab forward design leads to limo-like interior dimensions that rival that of an LTC Cartier L.  The look could be too much for conservative folks, but the LHS is far handsomer than a Bonneville, and cheaper too.  

Seat Comfort: 9/10

Nearly every gadget and toy under the sun is standard, despite the low 29k price tag.  You get power heated memory leather seats, though it is insulting that only the driver gets lumbar support, which is a weak manual knob at that.  The perforated leather seats are smooth and comfy, almost Benz-like in comfort, which belie the price.  The amount of leather is ample but not mind-blowing.  I was satisfied by the seats.  Moving on to the back seat, there is a beast-load of legroom as far as the eye can see.  You practically have to squint to see the front seat-back.  Needless to say, all huge FWD cars have a mega back seat *cough* Deville *cough*.  The back seats are reasonably comfy, and of course there's lots of room left to right as well.  The middle passenger is the one who gets penalized by a hard backrest since (s)he is up against the folded up rear armrest.  If you buy the car for one reason, buy it for the unholy back seat.  2 newly-wed NBA basketball players could use it for their honeymoon and not lack any space.			
General Comfort/Convenience: 10/10

There are a lot of places to stow what you own inside the LHS.  In the front, there is a hefty console and a myriad assortment of cupholders.  There is the full boat of equipment, from seat memory to moonroofs to optional genuine wood trim and driver info center to..well you get the point.  The back passengers receive a killer armrest with a pop-open storage bin, dual cupholders, a trunk pass-through, seatback pockets, reading lights I think, and even adjustable-mode air vents.  I could go on forever about the car's great interior design.  Ergonomics are excellent and everything is simple and in reach, for the most part.

Audio System: 11/10

Dear God, this car has an over-qualified audio system.  It's powerful enough to cause it's own potholes.  How does an 11-speaker, 360-watt, Infinity Spatial Imaging system sound?  Multiple speakers and subwoofers located in all positions throughout the car give the sound excellent quality, focus, and distribution.  The power is rich and phenomenal.  You couldn't find a better system in a Benz, Bimmer, Lexus, or Caddy.    Ok maybe the Bimmer.  But the system is easy to use and even sports a CD changer.  Fun for the whole family, even the bass-loving teenager in the family.  

Climate Control: plenty/10

I never used it much, but I never complained, and it looked easy to use.  The cabin was comfy at all times, from all angles, in all conditions.  Also, easy to use.  

Engine: 10/10

Heheh.  Engine good.  Heheh.  Sorry, just hypnotized by the beastly power of the LHS.  The 3.5L High-Output V6 moves the 3600 lb. LHS around with speed that rivals many of the vehicles from Star Wars.  Acceleration is smooth and fast, and reaches 60 in complete silence.  The transmission is well-suited to the LHS.  Overall, a rewarding car to drive.  But despite it's awesomeness, it could easily get cremated by a 330i or a Grand Prix GTP.  That's life, Chrysler.  But 253 horsepower is plenty for the LHS, so no worries.  

Handling: 9/10

Excellent handling in all situations.  Not too soft or too tight.  It can't do Viper-like maneuvers, but it can do almost anything else.  Definitely a fun large car.

Ride Comfort: 10/10

Smooth and pretty tight at all times.  Little body roll or wallow ever.  Rides like a cloud mounted on a freight train; fast but smooth.  

Quality: 9/10

Not quite a Lexus, but seems to be skillfully cobbled together.  Plastics are not too bad, and things look very nice all out.  Leather is soft and switchgear is smooth.  This car is not holy, but it sure seems like it in many ways.  Could it be perfect?  I have trouble believing it, but I may be right!

Overall: 10/10
It seems to be unbeatable.  It's fast, cheap, luxurious, and loaded down with all kinds of equipment.  Buy buy buy!
