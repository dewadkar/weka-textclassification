            I have a 1992 Acura Vigor GS that I bought used in the Fall of 1994. I had researched several vehicles before I bought this car and found this one to be the best buy.  This vehicle has a 2.5 5 cylinder engine that has 176 horsepower, more than many 6 cylinder vehicles, but much cheaper on insurance.  I have had no problems with my car it has performed excellently since I purchased the vehicle, the vehicle had 33,000 miles on it when purchased at a price of $17,900 compared to the sticker of $34,400 that was still in the car when purchased.  The car came completely loaded with every available option.  The car still performs wonderfully; gas mileage is excellent considering the power of the engine.  It performs excellently on both highways and back roads,I can range 450 highway miles to a tank of gas in my Vigor.  My insurance ranged from $65.00 a month when I purchased the car at 24 years old and is still only $51.00 a month and I am almost 30 years old presently.  The only draw back is when scheduled maintenance is needed it can be costly but always well worth it.  The 30,000, 60,000, 90,000 scheduled maintenance�s are the largest that you will ever probably need and can run as high as $550.00, but the engine is almost completely refurbished at these intervals of which can only be good for the car and prolong the car�s life even more.  However I will admit I am a bit of a fanatic about maintenance so this may be above what the normal person may have done to their automobile, but I only believe in the best for my car. The dealership has always been wonderful, my car is almost 8 years old still looks new and the dealership still will come and pick up my car at work or home to be service if needed without any involvement from me of which is great. I am a previous Honda owner (1987 Honda Accord) of which I loved, but was looking for a bigger and more powerful car without a lot more expense and the Vigor was the car for me.  I can highly recommend this car to anyone interested in purchasing this vehicle.<br><br>
