            On April 30th, 2002, my mom picked up her new Millennium Silver Metallic Lexus RX300. Let me tell you, it was the best day of my life. We waited just a day under one month for it and it came fully loaded with the navigation system, Xenon headlights, the neat little rear fin, heated seats, and so much more. Purchasing the navigation system was, in my opinion, so much cooler than anything else about the car. It has the 48 continental U.S. and all the Canadian provinces (minus the Yukon and the little Northeastern islands) and destinations for each. You can customize routes yourself by simply touching 'Avoid Freeway' or 'Minimize Ferries' among other options. The voice is concise and clear with just a hint of a Japanese accent. The voice has a presence to it but it's never intrusive or annoying. If you miss your turn, it silently searches for a new way to get where you're going. When you approach your instructed turn, the screen splits in two, the one on the right showing your upcoming turn. Route finding is quick, simple, and well-displayed. For long trips (I think over 50 miles), it gives you three different choices of routes and none are ever the same. And when entering an address, it eliminates letters that couldn't possibly match up with the one that came before it. For example, you couldn't put an X and then an L immediately afterward. But, the coolest thing about the Navigation System is the ability to program service items like oil and filter, tire change and rotation based on dates, mileage, or both, depending on what you want. The system will even remind you about a birthday or a wedding for crying out loud! Fingerprints on the touch screen are really irritating but wipe off easily. My only complaint is the fact that the climate control has only a tiny strip of the screen for about seven seconds after pressing a button or turning a knob. It really needs the whole screen with big digits.
     All right, enough about the GPS system, onto the car itself. The RX300 may look like an SUV but it is all Lexus soul underskin. The 3.0 liter V6 is buttery-smooth and gearshifts are seamless. The car is so quiet, we've almost accidentally tried to turn it on when it was already idling. Speed bumps, railroad crossings, and freeway expansion joints barely faze the RX300's ride. Tire and wind noise is practically non-existent and everything blends together like a giant melting pot. Nothing about this car is ever annoying. The seatbelt and key-in-ignition warning chimes are soft and never irritating. The turn signal indicator 'click' is muffled but present and obvious. It is never intrusive, either. However, like most SUVs, the RX300 never met a gas station it didn't like. We've been averaging a paltry 16.7 mpg. However, that's on stop-and-go city driving.
     Visibility on this car is top-notch. Let's start with light power. Limited-intensity Daytime Running Lights are standard. At night on a pitch dark road, the Xenon headlights are downright amazing. By flicking on the high-beams you are presented with an unparalleled light path. The Xenons have automatic activation (in long tunnels, dawn, dusk, or night) and have automatic leveling mechanisms to keep from blinding other drivers over hills and driveway grades. Crystal halogen fog lamps are standard equipment.
     Quality has long since been a Japanese trademark and this RX300 is no exception. Our 1993 Toyota Previa has 147,000 miles on it and has had only two tune-ups. That's why we decided to stick with a Toyota product. This car reeks of quality. It's everywhere: The doors close with a muffled but solid 'thump', the liftgate barely requires a finger's touch to latch, turn signal and wiper stalks engage with stiff but well-made clicks and everything feels solidly put together. The windshield wipers work silently, the windows roll up and down without a change in pitch from the electric motor as do the electric seats. Simply put, this is a phenomenal car. 
      Comfortable describes every aspect of the RX300. I mean, come on, Lexus is a LUXURY car maker. Obviously its cars are superior in luxury and comfort. The leather seats have a supple and incredible feel to them as if they are merely making a suggestion to hop in and drive across the country. 
      Okay, this SUV may be built on the proven Camry platform but that doesn't mean it's a sissy. It comes with a 3.0 liter V6 making 220 horsepower and 222 lb. ft. of torque all routed through probably the smoothest 4-speed automatic ever. 'Save Me' security and safety features are the standard-fare multiple-stage front airbags along with side thorax airbags, front seatbelt pretensioners with adjustable D-Rings, Anti-lock brakes with Brake Assist, and Vehicle Skid Control. Also included is a 3-point seatbelt and head restraint for the middle rear person and a weight-activated passenger seatbelt warning light. The front head rests go up high enough to protect a person probably up to just south of seven feet. An alarm system with remote control is standard fare.
     For parking a drink, the RX300 is all over it. Five cup holders give everyone a place to dock their pop. The front four adjust and the fifth pops out of the middle of the rear seat. It too is adjustable.
     For over a year, my mom was convinced the Acura MDX with Touring Package and Navigation System was for her. Then, they went to drive it a third time just to make sure and she got to ride in the back just to try it out. Well, it rattled like crazy and she claimed you couldn't hear front seat conversations and had to shout to make yourself heard. You draw your own conclusions. The RX300 may not have 240 horsepower or 3 rows of seats, but it has a refinement not remotely close to present in the MDX. We look forward to ten more years and 200,000 miles with our RX300 and we're loving every mile and minute in it.
