            I spent a good part of my holidays with my girlfriend and we took a lot of pictures with her new digital camera.  I was simply amazed at how easy to use and professional the photos appeared.  Sony has a magnificent product that is virtually foolproof.

The Sony digital cameras allow you to view the shot you are about to take which cuts down on wasted pictures.  However, wasted pictures are not much of a problem since you can erase what you just took and film is not needed.  Yet, being able to see how the picture will turn out is a nice touch as is being able to erase unwanted pictures and not dealing with film.  

The photos turned out to be exceptional.  Each of the ones that we did not erase looked very good on the computer screen after we downloaded them and also looked surprisingly good when we printed them out.  I would suggest getting a thicker laminate type paper for the best results when printing. Once printed you hardly notice a difference from normal film.  I was surprised by how vivid the color turned out to be and the fact that the details were all perfect.

The only complaint I had was the memory is limited.  However, this is more a problem with the technology that is currently available for a reasonable price.  I believe we were able to store around 20 photos on disk before having to download or erase some of the shots.  Not bad, but I was hoping to be able to store twice as many.  In due time technology will allow us this luxury.

I would recommend the Sony line of digital cameras to anyone.  The cameras are easy to use and take wonderful photos.<br><br>
