            I bought my Isuzu Rodeo from an Isuzu dealership in a town about 1hour north of where I live.  I drove the vehicle off the lot and about 15 to 20 minutes into the drive home I notice sort of a vibration when the brakes were applied.  Later I took the vehicle to the Isuzu dealership in my town to have a look at this problem and they told me that the brake disk had warped.  They were very good and prompt in replacing the disks and fixing the problem.  As well as this, there have been times that I have had to apply the brakes pretty hard to avoid an accident and it seemed to me that if I really had to stop that I'm not sure the brakes would have done the job.  I'm not that use to &quot;anti-lock brakes&quot; and maybe that is the normal action for this but it does raise some concern to me.  I have owned my Rodeo for almost 6 years now and for about the past year or so I have noticed the vibration feeling back in my braking.
Overall, the vehicle has been a very nice vehicle.  The only negative I have is that it seems to have a weak brake system for that size/heavy of a vehicle.<br><br>
