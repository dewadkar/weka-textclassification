            I just came back to the US and bought a Solara after reviewing dozens of models and trying to decide what I needed.  It's closest competition was the Honda Accord EX V6 Coupe and the Acura 3.0 CL.  It won out because Toyota was brave enough to pair a stick shift with their V6 engine.  Although I won't call the Solara the sportiest car around, it delivers both smooth and sporty performance.  The factors and prerequisites I was looking for in a car were:
- a sports coupe with decent utility, meaning room for four adults and luggage.
- powerful performance and good handling.
- a refined interior.  I wanted a luxury, quiet and elegance inside.
- a refined exterior.  I wanted a car that had classy, sporty good looks without being overblown on the testosterone.  I didn't want a Camaro.
- a car with a record for reliability.
- a manual transmission, if possible.
- A price tag around $25,000, if possible.

The Solara delivers on virtually everything I listed above as a prerequisite for the car I wanted to buy.  I highly recommend this car.  The Solara was the only model that delivered in all of these areas, and I wasn't going to get much more by going up another $15,000-$20,000.  Legend has it that Toyota was developing it as a Lexus coupe first, then switched it to Toyota to combat the popularity of the Accord Coupe. The interior is so quiet, serene and luxurious that I totally believe this thesis. 

The Honda and Acura got flagged on the manual transmission, which isn't offered with the V6.  Of the two Honda marks, the Acura is out of its depth with either the Accord Coupe or the Solara.  The one they are bringing out next year will probably be much more competitive.  All the Acura had on either model was the nameplate.

The Honda is also an excellent car.  It beats out the Solara slightly on looks (slightly more refined and cleaner, in my opinion), and just a little bit on handling.  But without the manual transmission, for me the driving experience was unexciting.  I'm glad Toyota had the sense to offer the manual transmission.  I love driving my car.  The Solara had other advantages over the Honda.  It has more interior room, especially in the back seat.  The Solara interior is also quieter and more luxurious than the Honda's.  Plus, the Toyota dealer was willing to deal on the Solara, meaning I got my car for ~$1.5K less than the Honda.  Price wasn't the only issue, however - Acura can't move the CL, and I could have gotten one at dealer invoice price.

The only issues that I have with the car are that the car _could_ be made more sporty, and I think Toyota should have worked harder on turning it into a full-fledged sports coupe.  The V6 engine is wonderful and makes the car fly, but the handling, while tuned for sportiness, sometimes reminds you of this car's Camry antecedent.  If they made the car handle better, shortened the turning radius and so on, there would be no car its equal anywhere near its price range.  My only other beef is the car's pass-thru when you flip down the rear seats to increase the cargo space.  First, the seats don't fold flat.  Then the pass-thru is too small too allow you to carry anything like a table top.  It's only about 30 inches wide.

Toyota is also known for making bland, ultra-reliable family cars that hold their value forever.  Honda's image is younger and more sporty.  I think these factors have contributed to Toyota's difficulty selling as many Solaras as they would like relative to the Honda, but the problem certainly isn't qualitative.  Ford had problems selling the Taurus SHO as well.

If you have to buy a sports coupe that's Sporty with a capital S, then you probably would want to pass on the Solara.  If you have to have a nameplate because that's part of your identity, then you probably want to pass on the Solara.  The car is outstanding for dozens of reasons, but these are not included.  But if you don't have to have BMW handling and a BMW nameplate, and would prefer more room inside, a quieter, more luxurious interior, a smooth and powerful engine, and save $15,000 then the Solara is your choice.  And although it doesn't handle like a BMW, the V6 Solara will outrun any 3-series model aside from the M3.  And as much as I respect BMW which provides you with more of a sports car, I didn't need the nameplate that badly.
