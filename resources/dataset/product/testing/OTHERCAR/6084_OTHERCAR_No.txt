            <i>Note: Please note the troubles I have had with this car at the end of the article.  I was happy when I found this car, but I am rapidly losing my confidence in my purchase.</i>

Over the past few months, I've been searching for the most perfect vehicle for my family.  I am pleased to tell you that on Saturday, I found that perfect car that meets all of my family's needs -- <b>The 2000 Chevrolet Impala Sedan</b>.

There are so many reasons why I purchased this vehicle:
<b>*</b> - It is within my budget.  I purchased this car for a little over $18,000.
<b>*</b> - My oldest son who is a big 6 foot 2 defensive lineman fits in this car comfortably and my youngest son who is four foot four is able to sit behind him comfortably with plenty of room to spare.
<b>*</b> - It had air conditioning and automatic transmission as standard options.

I test drove this car about 10 days ago when my sons and I decided to go check out the Impala together.  I had been impressed that the local police department had bought Impalas for police cars.  Knowing that they had to be big enough to put men into the back seat caused me to really realize that this vehicle was indeed big enough for my needs.

Upon my test drive, I could tell that this car was for me.  I barely touched the accelerator and the car went up to 50 mph without any effort at all.  That's because this vehicle has a 3.8 liter V6 engine which blew my former vehicle, a <i>1989 Toyota Camry's</i> 4 cylinder engine, out of the water.  The car literally flies and is dead, dead quiet.  While I was sitting still, I couldn't even hear the engine at all!

So, when I saw this beautiful white <b>2000 Chevrolet Impala</b> with gray interior sitting there at the credit union sale, I knew that it had to be mine.  It had every option that I wanted on it and nothing "more".  I could barely go to sleep dreaming of this car and me driving it. 

That's why I got to the sale early that day and bought the car as soon as the price was put into the window.  I didn't want anyone else getting this car at all. Even though the car has 19,900 miles on it, it's almost practically brand new and I have the assurance of having a 100,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty on this vehicle which gives me confidence that I will not have any problems in the future with repairs for quite some time.

I have to say that my adventures in this car hunt of mine has been interesting to say the least.  Personally, I am glad that this hunt for a new car is over... with me finally finding the car of my dreams at a price that I could afford.

If you have a chance to test drive and purchase this wonderful vehicle I encourage you to do so.  Since I bought this car yesterday, I have put 100 miles on it running around because I was tickled pink to get it.  I never thought I would purchase a used car again and definitely not an American used car but I am confident that the <b>Chevrolet Impala</b> is a car that will retain its value over years to come.

<i>Options in my new car include: AM/FM/Cassette Radio, tilt steering, cruise control, air conditioning, power windows, power locks, split bench seat, rear window defroster, power brakes.</i>

Note: My original Epinion on the purchasing experience of this vehicle states that there was 16,000 miles on the car.  That was what was on the sticker.  After I had the odometor read to drive from the lot, I found there was actually 19,900 on the car.

<i>Update 09/18/2000</i> - I've had my car now for one month!  Boy does time fly!  Since I purchased this car, I've put 1200 miles on it, mostly going to football games all over the Atlanta Metro area.  Currently I've been getting about 20 MPG with my city driving.  I anticipate that to get higher as the weather cools, because I quite often sit in the car to run the air as I am waiting for my son to finish football practice.  

However, I wanted to tell you about some of the things that I like/don't like so far about my car.  First, I love the fact that it has such a TINY turning radius for a large car.  It manuevers better with U-turns than my Camry ever did.  Second, I'm not used to parking a car this big so I'm having problems parking between the lines!  Third, I found out that apparently I do not have the split back seat to pull down to get into the trunk.  My trunk is very deep and it's hard to get into the back of it.  Finally, we can't figure out how to install the beverage holder.  My son and I have both scratched our heads and can't figure it out!  There's no directions in the user's manual either.  Other than that, I LOVE my car!  It was the best purchase yet!  

<i>Additional Information 11/23/2000:  About two months ago when Tropical Storm Helene came through this area, I was driving my car during the rain, and suddenly the steering wheel started squeaking when I was turning left.  At the same time there was water coming into the passenger side of the dash at the floor level.  I brought my vehicle to Nash Chevrolet, Lawrenceville, Georgia the following Monday where they told me that it was rain water coming into the car and that they had a specialist come in once a week to deal with leaks.  When asked about the squeak in the turning, they told me there wasn't one.  However, when I drove off of the lot, it squeaked and I was thoroughly ticked off that they did not look into this problem.  Because I only have one vehicle and am single, I didn't have any way to get my car into the shop, and because I "believed" that it was just a rain leak, I kept on driving my vehicle.

On 11/22/2000, I woke up on the coldest morning yet here in the Atlanta Metro Area.  I went downstairs, started the car without any problem and turned on the heater and nothing blew out.  Consequently I had to bring my car to the shop.  I chose to go out of town to Jerry Brown Chevrolet, Buford, Georgia to have them look at my heater fan.  The motor had been locked up because there was an air condition leak with the water (ah ha, wrong diagnosis at Nash Chevrolet).  So, they drained and unclogged that area, and put in a new motor.  However, later that evening I was driving home and the fan would only blow on high.  Furious, I called the service department and demanded some kind of action for this coming Monday because I was not going to get another rental car for the day. They assured me that it sounded like the resistor had shorted out probably because of the water leak.  Why they did not replace that at the same time, I have no idea, but at this moment, I am furious with Chevrolet's service and am not a happy camper at all. </i>

<i>March 5, 2001</i>  Again my Impala is leaking water into the dash and into the pasenger side of my car.  The resistor has blown and I call Jerry Brown, absolutely furious about my car.  They give me the loaner vehicle from the dealership and fix my car the next day.  However, I am not very pleased about this situation. (Note: I found out later this has happened to other 2000 Impalas)

<i>April 28, 2001</i> After driving to my mailbox at the front of the complex, the check engine light starts to come on and will not come off even though the car is functioning properly.  I go home, cancel all my plans and make plans to drive my vehicle to Jerry Brown.  Come to find out they are closed for inventory.  Two hours later I try my car again and the light does not stay on.  I am baffled as to what to do now. (I found out that I had some bad gas in my car later.)

<i>April 29, 2001</i>  Even though I still have 1200 miles until my next oil change the change oil light has come on in my car.  I checked the oil and it is low.  I have not seen an oil leak so I have no idea what is going on.  I will call the dealership tomorrow and see what they want to do. (Note: I brought my car in and found out that my vehicle has a "reminder" setting that goes off every 7500 miles to remind you to change the oil.  They had not reset it from the last time I had it changed and that's why it was going off.

<i>August 13, 2001</i>  I went to the ATM machine after work to check my balance on my account because it was the first day of school (and I had written out about $400 worth of checks), when my driver's side power window froze in the down position.  There was a great thunderstorm coming my way and I had to rig up a temporary window of plastic bags -- definitely not my idea of a good time.  When I brought my vehicle in the following morning, another 2000 Impala was behind me and found out that she had the same thing happen to her.  This quite obviously is a bug in the car.

<i>December 14, 2001</i> I took my car in to get two new tires because the previous owner did not rotate the tires and wound up buying four instead because one of the other tires had a huge plug in it that I did not know about.  I realize that isn't part of the car itself (mechanical), but I wanted to point out the following.  When they took the tires off of the car, there were no brake pads on the front at all and it was already leaving its mark on the disk.  The back were not much better so I had to have a complete brake job.  My car has 37,500 miles on it at this point.

Needless to say my opinion of this car is degrading quickly.  With automobiles as expensive as they are there is absolutely no reason why this car should be doing any of this, especially since it is still underneath original waranty.  For the first time today, I wished I had not bought this car even though I enjoy driving it so.

I never had any of these problems with my Camrys and even though it would have been a problem getting my son into one, I wish I would have bought one instead of this Impala.
