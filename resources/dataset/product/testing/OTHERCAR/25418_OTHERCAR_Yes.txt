            The ES300 is one of the nicest car in its class. It is similar to numerous other mid-sized luxury cars. Some may even call it full sized, but I guess it is all in the eye of the beholder. I think of even bigger cars when I look at &quot;full-sized&quot; cars. The Lexus ES 300 is developed along the same line as the Toyota Camary and the Toyota Avalon. Each has different features with the Camary being the base and the Lexus ES 300 being the top of the line in that model/style vehicle. 

The Lexus ES 300 has been around for a while and continues to be a popular seller for Lexus. They redesign the car every once in a while. In fact, since we got my wife this car, it has been redesigned to add a few new features that are more cost effective as technology developments continue to push the price of some features lower. 

The ES 300 has a very sporty acceleration. Handling in this car is great. The car gets decent mileage and has a good cruising range. My wife and I enjoy driving the car. On long trips the car is comfortable and floats along the road like a magic carpet. It is not hard to drive well above the speed limit and not know, by feel alone, that the car is going so fast. More than once, I have looked at the speedometer to realize that I was gliding along at 20+ over the limit, which is not too wise in some parts of Texas. 

The seats are very comfortable. They are full leather, which is soft to the touch. The doors are also appointed with leather as is the steering wheel. The dash is much like that in other cars. The controls are reasonably easy to reach. With the push of a button you can get the outside temperature as well as set your climate control system to the desired interior temperature. You can easily heat or cool the car to a desired level, unless you plan to store meat in the car.

The stereo in this car can really put out the sound. You can purchase a CD changer as part of the package, which I am sure most do. The sound quality is great, especially when playing CDs. The CDs sure can make a long trip not seem so long. The radio also produces pleasant music if the radio station is putting out a good signal. 

The back seat passengers get pretty good leg room when riding in this car. They get at least as much room as you do on any of the major US airlines. Their rears are comfy in the leather seats. They have plenty of head and shoulder room. They even have s drink holder that pops out from the center console. This console additionally provides them with air conditioning. There is even a center arm rest that comes down from middle of the rear back to the seat. One can access the trunk through that area also.

The back seat is great for adding a car seat. Our little one rides comfortably in her rearward facing car seat. She normally falls asleep due to the smooth ride. We found that this car works better than our RX 300 for securing the car seat for some reason. The car seat is not going any where unless we unbelt it which makes me feel safer. 

There are a few downsides to the car. The car is a bit short of headroom if you are tall in the torso. I notice that I sometimes feel like there is not a lot of space between my head and the roof when I am driving. When I am in the back, it seems I have additional room. I can adjust the seat some and the will help provide a bit of additional room. Just do not pop in with your cowboy hat on as you will not fit. Maintenance is expensive at the dealership, but would you let just anybody work on the car? 

Lexus provides good service and takes care of their customers. We will buy a third Lexus when we need another car. We will not give up the two we have now since they both serve us so well. Buy an ES300 if you need a sedan and you will not be disappointed. You instead will be treated to car that is reasonably priced, provides a great ride, and can really carry five adults when necessary.
