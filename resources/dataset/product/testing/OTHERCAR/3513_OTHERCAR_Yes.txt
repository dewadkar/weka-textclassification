            This is a camera for sale at a reasonable price which does much of what the higher priced cameras do, and has a slight advantage when using HP Photo printers to publish the images. Resolution goes as high as 2.1 megapixels, and that is a significant accomplishment at a camera of this price.

I think it's uses (for me) are limited at this point and time to lower resolution imagery, so I would not recommend it for most professionals in the market for a digital camera. Much time can be spent in the company of your computer improving your image output, but that isn't the issue here. The higher resolution images take up so much memory on the compact flash card, that you are prompted to do one of two things, 1) take the eight or so pictures, store them on your hard drive (or CDW) and start over or 2) Keep buying more memory cards. This can get expensive in a hurry.

Just for your edification, let me tell you some of the approximate prices for the memory cards

8 MB (as supplied with the camera) varies from $30 retail
16MB $30-50 retail
48 MB $ $75-100
96 MB $150
 
Of course, it is possible an auction site will have them cheaper but you do get what you pay for.

These are the advantages of this camera (from my point of view)

1) Runs on standard double A batteries
2) Lens protection is automatic when the camera is off.  While this may seem trivial, in fact it is a big hairy deal when a prized image is distorted by a scratch
3) Ease of operation
4) Has an infra red feature, which allows &quot;jet send&quot;, to print your images directly to the HP Photosmart 1000, or better, printers
5) Accompanying software allows for easy filing and pulling up images
6) Compact flash card can be read directly by printer, without hooking up to the camera
7) The quality of the high resolution photos are excellent and the lower resolution pictures are reasonably good
8) LIGHT WEIGHT and extremely portable
9) Images can be reviewed with the lens cover closed and deleting is a snap

These are the disadvantages of the HP 315 from my point of view

1) A little expensive for the package
2) No adapter to run the camera off normal power sources
3) Maximum zoom is 2.5 X. This is just not enough when you are increasing distance to prevent flash white-out.

To the glory of Hewlett Packard, the accessories are not hard to find and they are not expensive, although I haven't yet availed myself of any. All the software and features are compatible within the realm of HP technology. (Standard photo paper works well with the printer.)

The chief advantage of this camera over the SONY brands that I dearly love, is that I can put it into my backpack and take it to work with me without being permanently disabled by the weight, and the convenience of the more universal flash card storage media. I like the fact that I can print the thumbnails stored on the card and preview without pulling up each individual image using the software. When I am in a hurry this is a major convenience.

Recommendation:

If you need a camera that will work as well as your autofocus 35 mm camera (I have an Olympus and  few others) then this the ideal camera for you. It is protected by the cover and takes great pictures. If you want snapshots of ordinary things, this also works well. The color pickup is actually very good, and I have had no complaints from my clients.
