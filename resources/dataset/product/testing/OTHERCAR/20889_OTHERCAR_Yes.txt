Several years ago, Chrysler touted out a car called the Plymouth Pronto on the auto show circuit.  It combined the front-end of a Plymouth Prowler with the utility of a wagon or small SUV in a unique, plastic-clad body.

I instantly loved the idea - coupling style and versatility usurped the SUVs out there, and offered more than a car could.  Today, the PT Cruiser I drive gives me everything I've wanted at a good price.

I own a Limited Edition PT, automatic, with all options except for ABS and the underseat storage drawer.

<b>In the Driver's Seat</b>

The riding position of the PT is very good.  You have a commanding view over cars, but it's not as high as a minivan or SUV, so those cars will still block your line of sight.  Blind spots, often bandied about in reviews, are not an issue for me - in fact, they are rather small with the large side windows.

All controls are within easy reach.  The gauge cluster is smaller than average, but easily read; a large, legible font is used.  The HVAC system is lifted out of the Neon and might pose a problem at first; it uses one knob to control the fan and A/C.  On most cars, you can choose the intensity, and hit an A/C button.  On the PT, you must turn the knob to the left to the desired intensity for A/C, and to the right to the desired intensity for the fan.  I had no problem with it, but others could - a car shouldn't befuddle.

The power window controls are in a curious location above the HVAC controls.  It takes a bit of getting used to, but I have found it to be within a convenient reach.  My PT includes a CD and cassette, and the only gripe I have is that the equalizer controls are awfully small to adjust while in traffic.

The PT rides much like my previous car, a Dodge Stratus.  Smooth on most roads; slightly jiggly on broken pavement.  The car always feels at ease and solid, however.  Handling is superb for a tall car: turns can be taken at speed, and there is never a sense of, "Holy crap, the car is going to tip!"

In reviews, much has been said about the allegedly anemic automatic transmission but, I have had no problems.  Like any Chrysler 4-cylinder, it needs to be wound up a bit to hit more power, but the PT does have more than a modicum of torque.  I would be remiss in not saying that the PT does feel more comfortable at speeds of 20-50mph, but is very much ready for action at 70mph.

<b>Appointments</b>

The Limited comes with a leather-and-suede interior, and feels more expensive than it is.  The driver gets an armrest but the passenger doesn't (odd).  I also have a moonroof, "oh my God" handles for all four doors, power mirrors, power locks, power windows, compass and temperature display, several cupholders, and many cubbyholes.  The map pockets in the doors are large and commodious; they'll hold oodles of CDs.  The center console includes the most perfectly positioned cupholder in any vehicle on earth, along with another CD-ish holder and a small shallow tray for pens.  The coin holders are plentiful and are padded so as to avoid a jingling noise while driving - nice touch.

Cruise control is intelligent, and holds its speed admirably on hills.  Wipers do a good job of clearing the windshield and hatchback window.

The HVAC controls are powerful enough for this vehicle.  Heat comes up rather quickly, and defrosters work very well.  The airflow vents on the dashboard are not standard; there is a small rotary knob used to control the amount of flow, and a small funnel of sorts to direct the airflow.  The glove box is good but not great.  Room underneath seats is impressive (a small box could fit!), and each front seat has a pocket on its backside.

<b>Features</b>

The PT is almost too versatile for its own good.  The front passenger seat folds and becomes a table.  The rear seats are 35/65.  You can tumble them forward and latch them to the car's pillar for more space.  You can remove them.  The parcel shelf in back has five positions, one of which is a table!  The shelf has hooks for grocery bags, and also has a non-carpeted side for messy cargo.  If you don't go for a subwoofer, you'll get a pocket in the left rear section of the car, handy for utility items.

The cargo capacity and versatility is what makes this purchase easier to swallow.

<b>The Exterior</b>

The PT has a load of style.  This is a double-edged sword; if you'd like to remain anonymous, try a Camry.  The PT doesn't get lost in parking lots, and since getting the car many people have stopped to ask me about it.  Inspired by old time vehicles, the PT comes off as a modern interpretation that nods its head to the past, but fully endorses today.  The upshot is that this design won't look dated in 10 years.

The door handles are the old push-button type, and everyone who has been in my car loves them.  Doors feel solid when they're closed.  The hatchback often requires two closes.

<b>Mileage, Etc.</b>

Gas mileage at this stage of the game is pretty bad, but that's expected due to the newness of the vehicle.  The PT has a 15-gallon tank and gets 21/25 on the automatic.  Nothing stupendous, but not horrible, either.

The PT is small, make no bones about it.  This makes it easy to park and easy to live with, but its cargo capacity and fun-to-drive characteristics make it a plus for city dwellers.

<b>Conclusion</b>

The PT offers everything I want in a vehicle, and everything I need.  It's got a great interior, an adequate engine, and fantastic styling; unless you have an aversion towards its looks, I can't think of a reason not to buy one.

<b>The One Month Progress Report</b>

It's now been about a month since I got my PT, and I've racked up some decent miles on it.  What do I think so far?  I love it.  Fantastic vehicle.

The only problems I've run into have been minor.  First, the hazard light switch decided to stop functioning about two weeks back - pressing it did nothing.  Unfortunately it stopped working in the "on" position and thus, I had blinkers all the time (this was alleviated with a bit of creativity.)  It was fixed in one week (turnaround time for the part.)

Second, the gas gauge is occasionally inaccurate.  It was nearly yelling at me a few weeks ago to fill up, and only took 12 gallons at the pump; the capacity is 15 gallons.  This might be a feature.

Other than that, the car is doing quite fine.  Gas mileage has improved a bit and has been sitting around 23mpg for me (city and highway combined.)  People still stare and ask me questions about it, out of the blue, which amuses me to no end.

<b>The Three Month Progress Report</b>

It's been three months already, and the rainy weather here hasn't deterred the PT.  Overall, I'm still very very pleased with the car.  The only minor problem has been squeaky front windows when rolling up or down.  The dealer will check it out this week, which will also bring in the PT's first oil change.

Gas mileage has been strictly middle-of-the-pack, sitting at about 23-24 MPG.  It's not horrific, but of course, this isn't *really* an economy car.  The power of the car overall is still very good.  Great handling, easy to parallel park, great ride - I'm still pleased.

<b>The One-Year-Plus Progress Report</b>

A year later, and I am finding the PT to be a good car on balance.  The niggle?  Gas mileage is awful.  I live in the city, and the mileage dips awfully low - particularly with the A/C on - making my visage familiar to the gas station attendant.

This is a fault of the car's weight and relatively small engine; the PT is a heavy little guy and needs more in the get-up-and-go department.  At this point I'm slightly more interested in gas mileage than I am in anything else and, for that, the PT does not do well.

My fiancee initially did not like the car, but has grown attached to it.  We both like it, outside of the gas mileage issue.
