            I am here to give you ten reasons why you should buy a chevy.
 #1.The automatic head lights for the hands free systm
 #2.The powerful 270hp vortech engein that can haul anything
 #3.The new stylin rims that complimint the truck
 #4.The new body style is the bomb
 #5.The factory CD player sonds great
 #6.The seats are as calm as a cloud
 #7.There is alot of leg room
 #8.Great A,C 
 #9.0-60 in 4.2 seconds
#10.And factory headers which incresses the horse power

But the factory speakers arent that great, but no factory are great and i also like to add that it drives like a dream.
