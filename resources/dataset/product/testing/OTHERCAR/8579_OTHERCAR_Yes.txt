            I always wanted to write on my Grand-Am. I have a 1994 Grand Am Gt. As it was a limited addition and with sports car style I could not pass it by.

 As the story goes I had a old 1980 Ford Fairmont station wagon and looking around for 3 months drove down the auto row and spotted this white Grand-am and there was no price on it and had to sleep on it until the next day to go and see how much it was.

 Well my husband at the time went and got the car and came home and surprised me with it and said honey put out your hand out and I did and it was a car key and I said  Whats this?  He said go out side and I did and I cried and it was the Grand-Am at the dealer I saw the night before.

 Its loaded. Has power windows, alarm, AC, Stereo system, 4 door, ABS system, Cruise Control, Electric adjustable drivers side sitting, and white and black interior. I could not believe my eyes this wonderful car is mine. I still have it and its as good as new.

 I have 111,200 miles on it and I have not had trouble with it yet. Well some things as battery replacement and tires 2 times all around in 10 years. Had extended Warranty and took care of some electric parts as to no cost to me. All I can say  is this car is great and would hope it will go on being good for many more years. 

I would buy another Pontiac again if and when I need another car. I think this one is running better than most new cars. I have never had a tune-up on it yet. Now whats that tell you. Do not want to change the way its running.
