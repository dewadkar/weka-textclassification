            We used the Blazer as a rental car on a recent 22 hour business trip.  There were 2 women and myself.  The shortest of us was 5'2&quot; and I am 6'2&quot;.  Although It was a nice ride for the women I had a somewhat difficult time, as my head would just barely brush the canopy.  To compensate for that I had to lean further back than I was comfortable with.  It would be good for somebody 6', but any taller and I hope you find reaching for the steering wheel and leaning back comfortable.

The back seat was surprisingly roomy, but once again the headrests were made for somebody slightly shorter than I.  The ride was quite and the suspension was very nice.  The 4 wheel high and low drives were a nice touch, in case I ever needed them.

Blazers don't have the greatest record, and this isn't the exception to the rule.  I am confident in telling you that if you are 6' or less, it may be a good choice for you.  If not, I wouldn't consider this an option.<br><br>
