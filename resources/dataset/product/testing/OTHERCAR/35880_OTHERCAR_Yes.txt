            I must admit that when my husband wanted to purchase the 1996 Jeep Cherokee Sport which is currently in our driveway I wasn't very excited nor pleased...

I'm used to cars that semi-float down the road, afterall!  Why would we want this?  The only thing we ever need to transport is groceries, the dog and occasional stuff from Lowes!

However, there are certain aspects to this vehicle that lend themselves to utility and function.  It can carry a lot and carry items well.

This car was purchased in Florida for a great deal - it had only 24,000 miles and was in great shape.  (vehicle was purchased in 2000)  We drove it back to Michigan over a period of two days.  The engine performed flawlessly, no transmission problems and the a/c does perform well.

The biggest flaws of this vehicle are:

--The seats.  Comfort ain't the first priority apparently at Jeep Engineering.  I wish that they slid back a bit farther and that the back of the seat was able to adjust to a more comfortable angle.  I found the very upright position uncomfy for a long distance drive.

--LEGROOM.  HELLO?  Is anyone else out there over 5'9"?  When I'm in the passenger seat the legroom is not too much of a problem, but driving... Whoa.  I worry that if I ever got into an accident I'd slice my legs off at the knee as my knees come within 1/2 an inch of the dash.

And let's be honest, the backseat is basically useless except for Sophie, our dog.  She has no complaints.  :)

And the ride is a little too bumpy for me, but as I said I'm biased toward smoother cars to begin with.  This vehicle has never been off-road, and as it's not a 4x4 it probably never will be.  However it does perform well in the deep snow we're prone to here one or two times during the winter.

I find that in our area this vehicle is especially popular with high school aged kids.  And it's obvious why - it's got power, room for all their friends and the availability to tow jet skis and boats on weekends.

I wish the car had a few other options such as a sunroof and cruise control.  But for running around town the car does perform well mechanically and it's a very popular vehicle up here.  The only mechanical problems we've experienced is a sensor that went "bad" twice that causes the "check engine" light and the transmission to slip.  The first time this cost about $300 to repair, but the second time it was obviously under warranty.  Perhaps as the first owner hardly drove the car that caused a few more problems than if the vehicle had been used everyday.

The mileage we get averages about 15 in the city and no more than 18 on the highway.  That is a bit of a problem with gas pushing the $2.00 mark, but it's utility can outweigh the pump price when you need to haul something around.
