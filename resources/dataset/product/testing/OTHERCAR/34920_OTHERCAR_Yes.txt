            Boy, I have never seen a automobile that was so well thought out as the Honda Odyssey!  It seems like there are so many little touches that make it a very enjoyable car.  Some of the special touches we like are:
-possibility to regulate heat/fan in the back of the van
-dual automatic sliding doors with safety feature
-hide-away third row bench
-volume controls on the steering wheel
-Dual trip mileage counters
-Controls to open garage or gate
 and so much more!

The large downside is of course the wait!  We had to wait 8 months for ours and our reason for ordering it was to replace my 2-door Civic due to the imminent arrival of our first child.  She arrived a month ahead of schedule and the van took 3 months more than they had thought.  The reason, I'm sure, is that they can't keep up with the demand.  As for price, I believe it's one of the more &quot;best buys&quot; for it's price range.  Even my Dad, who would never buy other than American makes, thinks it's a great car and good buy.  So far we've no complaints on how it performs.  We're very happy we've decided on this automobile and recommend it to anyone looking for a family upgrade!<br><br>
