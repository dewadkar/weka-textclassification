            The 2000 Lexus LS 400 is one of the best luxury sedans I have seen. If you want luxury and style this is the car. This car has many great features. It has comfortable leather seats which can adjust to your style of comfort and, it has plenty of room to accomodate its passengers. It has an electronic dash board which gives you all the information you need to know. The Lexus LS 400 looks just as great outside as it does inside. This is also a great car for long trips. It has one of the smoothest rides ever. I believe this car can be one of the most reliable cars a person can purchase. If it is properly maintained and well kept, it should last for years to come. Even though the Lexus LS 400 is a little costly, it is a wise investment. I recommend it to anyone who wants a reliable car that will last forever.<br><br>
