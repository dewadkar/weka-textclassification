            I bought this vehicle because of it's reputation for being a reliable, safe, and easy to drive car.  It also is known to last a long time, if taken care of properly.  I bought a 1998 Toyota Corolla, back in March of the same year.  I still own it and still enjoy driving it just as when it was brand new.  It runs the same and has so far lived up to it's reputation.  The '98 models were much different from previous year models of the same car.  There are many more safety features than before and they drive better, with better handling than before.  Safety features, such as the daytime running lights and the side airbags all provide a nice discount on my auto insurance, as well.  On a personal level, I would prefer not to have daytime running lights.  There are times you only want the parking lights on and it is not possible as long as this feature is connected.  The lights automatically go on, whether you want them to or not.

I chose a model with a sunroof, for personal preference, and there are absolutely no associated problems with that.  For example, leaking after it rains.  I am very pleased with the quality of this vehicle.  It rains a lot here, in South Florida, and so I am experienced in driving in such weather.  I feel safe in this car during these times, as well, as other times.  I find that it has plenty of trunk room/space.  The mouth of the trunk is wide enough to fit most things I would put in there for travelling with.  There is even a small light in the trunk so you can see in at night.  My last car did not have that and I can see the great benefit of it now.

I feel that this car is not bad looking either.  I don't really go for the sport car look anyway, and this is just what I need.  The gas mileage is great, too!  I take this car so far before I need to fill up.  I get about 300 miles to the tank, even from new.  I have taken this car on long distance trips before, and I feel very comfortable the whole way along.  I can go across from the east to the west coast of Florida without even thinking about if I need gas or not.  It only uses about a quarter of a tank for me.

I will say that the car is also pretty roomy, except if tall people are sitting in the front of the car and move the seats back far, it reduces the amount of leg room you get in the back and from time to time feels like there should be more room.<br><br>
