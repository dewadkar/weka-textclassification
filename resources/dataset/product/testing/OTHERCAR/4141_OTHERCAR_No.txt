            My husband bought one of these Bravada's brand new in 1993.  At first the car seemed to work wonderfully, but later one things just started going bad.  The luggage rack on the top fell off while he was driving, and it doesn't get very good gas mileage.  He recently spent $2,000 to get something else fixed, I am not for sure exactly what it was but I think it is called the drive shaft.  The car shakes an awful lot, and there is only 85000 miles on it.  The knob to the back window broke.  On the plus side of the car, it is very roomy and comfortable.  It can carry lots of groceries and other supplies that one might need.  The car can also be fun to drive, because it is much higher than my honda civic.
