            Ok I have been putting it off for a while so I guess I will finally write a review on the car I currently drive.  I bought my Camry as a cheaper replacement for my trouble free 4runner.  I have LE version with the 2.2 liter four.  Obviously I did not buy this car for flashy style or exciting performance.  I was expecting years of trouble free driving though.  Unfortunately that has not been the case.

If you have read my reviews you know I like to get the bad news out of the way first.  Most Toyota owners talk of their trouble free cars but My Camry apparently is not listening. I know I am nick-picking but this is a Toyota, a brand famous for dependability. During the first 25,000 miles I had the power window motors replaced (all doors), alarm shock sensor and the front and rear brakes replaced twice to remedy a strong vibration.  Now at 50,000 miles my dealer is telling me I need a new steering rack.  More perplexing is that my extended warranty will not pay for it until fluid starts leaking!  I do not consider myself an abusive owner so I am surprized I have experienced these problems. I have noted that the 4Runner was assembled in Japan and the Camry in America, I guess there is a difference.

Other wise I praise the cars mechanics.  The 2.2 four provides acceptable acceleration and outstanding fuel economy.  I have recorded up to 32 MPG on a road trip with four adults aboard.  The car also has exceptional cruising range; I have driven over 470 miles on one tank of gas!  I will say that the engine will take note when you load it up on passengers or luggage. You will find yourself being passed on long grades.  If you want better acceleration spring for the V6 option (standard on the XLE).  I believe the XLE also has a firmer suspension, which could help keep the tail pipe and muffler from dragging on driveways.  Note that the car has large (by modern standards) overhang front and rear so scraping something on speed bumps or steep driveways is common.

My interior is equipped with wood grain accent on the dash and console which really does a great job at classing up the feel of the interior.  My car also has the side-impact airbags.  These are housed in the outside side seat bolster.  I cannot comment on the effectiveness of this feature and hopefully never will!  The seats themselves are easy to get comfortable in.  The rear seat has good room for two adults but the drivers seat electric motors cut into foot room under the seat.  The large trunk has plenty of room for luggage and nice cubbies for storage.  The full-size spare tire is a nice touch as well.  

The exterior is very conservatively styled. My car has a paint sealent installed by Gulf States Toyota Distributor.  So far no fading and water still beads quite strong despite me not waxing.  Yes I know, I will try to wax it next weekend.  The bumpers themselves are strong having survived a couple of hits by other cars without damage. 

Toyota designed the Camry to blend into many different peopleï¿½s lives and it has successfully blended into mine.  I think you will find the same.  It is not a perfect car, but it does so many things so well you forget that.
