            Mazda has always been one of those Other Brands, something you hear about from time to time but never quite at the forefront of consumer consciousness, and the 626 contributes to this lack of image - while the 626 is as worthy an automobile as you can get for its price, it's not so distinctive that people will throw down their remotes and rush off to the nearest Mazda store.

My own 626 is a '93 in the LX trim line, with the 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and the four-speed automatic transmission.  I bought it in 1998 after discovering that most of the things I could afford were either aggressively bland or already beaten to death.  It was clear from the first drive that Mazda wanted people to drive this car, not just schlep around stuff from Sam's Club in it; the 626 loves the twisty bits, and while there's a fair amount of body roll, it never seems to lose its grip.  Even the most pedestrian powertrain, the one I have, is more than capable of getting out of its own way, and the EPA's mileage figures for this model - 23/31 highway - are precisely what I'm getting, even at 85,000 miles.  Mazda's weatherstripping is not the sturdiest on earth, and starting in the 1994 model year, the number of transmission problems jumped upwards a couple of notches, but so far, I'm pleased with my '93, and its total maintenance and repair costs have yet to reach the $1000 mark*, while my previous car (not a Mazda) averaged nearly $1300 a year and drank twice as much fuel in exchange for no more horsepower.  

Most people looking for cars in this class end up with Camry or Accord, and those are excellent cars as well.  But if you've had one of these and thought that you were drowning in vanilla the whole time, the 626 may be just what you're looking for.

*<i>Addendum, 2/00:</i> Well, I'm now over $1000 - slightly.
