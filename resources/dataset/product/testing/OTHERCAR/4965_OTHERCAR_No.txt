            I was in the market for a new car and the XG300 caught my eye.  From what I could find and from peeking in the windows at the dealership, it looked to be very nice.  The following Monday, I went to the dealership and took one for a test drive.  The salesperson brought out a black XG300 with a sunroof that had about 300 miles on the odometer.  

I looked over the car from the outside and the fit and finish looked to be pretty good.  I got inside and the first thing that struck me (I know this may sound silly), but it didn't smell like a near-luxury car.  It didn't have an expensive leather smell, it had kind of a cheap-smelling petroleum plastic smell.  However, the interior appointments were very tasteful and pleasing to the eye.  It had a very nice CD stereo in it as well.  On the console on the roof, there is a compartment for a garage door opener or sunglasses, I couldn't tell, because the lid had fallen off.  Around this compartment, the headliner was pulling away from the overhead console.  Overall, the quality of materials in the interior looked to be a step down from the competitive models (Accord, Maxima).  Remember, this was on a car that is being marketed as a "near-luxury car".  I don't remember seeing these build quality issues in the last Acura that I was in (or Honda for that matter).  Also, the 100K mile warranty is only valid for the original owner.  It also doesn't cover adjustments (what does that mean?), interior or paint.

I did take it for a drive and the motor was very smooth and had a decent amount of power.  The transmission shifted smoothly in both full automatic and in the Shiftronic mode.  The car rode very smoothly and was nice on the highway.  Overall, I was impressed with the car's road manners.  If you go in expecting a sports sedan, this isn't the car for you.  It is really more of a highway cruiser.  There was another quality issue that I noticed on the highway.  The car already had a pulsation in the brake pedal that felt like warped brake rotors.  Remember, this car only had 300 miles on it.

If the buyer is just looking at the price of the car, I don't see it being a bad car for the money.  However, I was looking to lease.  When leasing, the residual value of the car becomes just as important as the selling price.  I figured that I would have been able to purchase one of these for around $21,000.  When I looked at leasing it, the residual value was going to be around $9,800.  So, the cost of depreciation for three years of use was going to be $11,200.  This translated to a lease payments of $452 per month.  For this lease payment, you could be driving an Acura 3.2 TL (I was offered one for $449).  I am sure the vast majority of consumers out there would agree that the TL is a far superior vehicle to the XG.  Of course, if you purchased rather than leased the the XG, you would see similar cost of ownership once it came time to sell it.

I really thought the car was a decent performer.  Nice smooth ride, quiet and powerful engine and smooth-shifting transmission.  The amenities were nice.  However, none of the attributes of this car were enough to make me overlook the high cost of ownership and uncertain reliability.  If it would have been a $17K-$18K car, I may have been able to overlook some of the flaws.  The interior fit and finish and warped brake rotors with virtually no miles on the car make me wonder what "hidden surprises" this car had in for it's first owner.  For low to mid $20K's that the XG300 costs, there are lots of very nice cars out there that are just as nice, have lower cost of ownership and a more certain future.
