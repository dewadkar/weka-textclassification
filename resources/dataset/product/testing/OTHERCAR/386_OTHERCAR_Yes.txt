            today for the first time i drove the nissan xterra they drive like a dream. The handeling on this sport utility are one of no other when i drove this vehicle it was like i was floating on a cloud of air.  This vehicle has enough leg room and space for a big or small family the v6 engine just purrrs like a kitten.  The sound system has 6 speaker most come with tape and cd deck the surround sound is wonderfull for when you are stuck in traffic. it  easily can get you out of jams. The 4X4 is great for the snow and ice many a times i have needed that
