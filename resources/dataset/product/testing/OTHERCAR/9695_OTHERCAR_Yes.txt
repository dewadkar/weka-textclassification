            I have to say I love everything about this car.  And I did a lot of research..like almost twenty years worth. Well that's not exactly true. Basically the last new car I bought myself was my much beloved 1984 Honda Prelude. I say that was the last new car I bought for myself as that was also the same year I got married and ever since then I&#146ve been buying new cars for my wife. Thus a few years later when we started having kids the inevitable happened...the dreaded minivan reared its ugly head. My wife wanted one and I didn&#146t so naturally we got one. That meant that her car, a 88 Honda Accord,  would become mine as my Prelude no longer was a viable family vehicle (at least that's what she told me ;-). After her infatuation with the minivan ended she got a Subaru Outback and then after that a even newer faster Subaru Outback. All the while in this vehicle buying frenzy I&#146m still toddling around town in the Accord. But two months ago fate stepped in and decried my Accord DOA. With my wife still in her 2002 Outback my turn had finally come. Its also worth noting that I&#146m not a car guy in the sense that I have no mechanical knowledge of how they work at all. I kind of feel like I&#146m in the same camp as Bill Cosby when he said &#148if you put the key in and the car wont go...its broken&#148. That pretty much sums up the width and breadth of my automotive knowledge. Well that plus higher horsepower usually means it goes faster...I love that.

So as my Honda was going through its death throes I looked at several vehicles. I knew we needed a sedan (still have to cart the kids around after all) and so concentrated my energies there. We looked at and drove the BMW 325, The Volkswagen Passat W8, the Audi A4, and the Acura TL Type S.  In this company the Acura was the cheapest which was certainly tempting. And in our opinion it has the largest interior cabin of any of them. Now I have to say I think the BMW is a fine car and is good looking to boot. Plus its fast. But its also, relatively speaking , more expensive to repair. In fact when we looked at Consumer Reports we found that all the European vehicles were more costly in that regard. But those more practical concerns aside, my wife and I really liked the Acura. I guess because of my long history with Hondas I knew what their reliability and cost to maintain was like and I took some comfort in that.

As I noted above the Acura model we focused on was the TL Type S. The Type S part was my choice as I need to prop up my ever flagging testosterone level wherever possible. And at 260 horsepower I feel I can safely forestall Viagra for another few years. Seriously, the car is fast. Is has great acceleration and handles beautifully. I know that several other reviewers have not been as enthusiastic about the cars&#146 handling as some of the other  vehicles I mentioned above. But bear in mind my perspective is one of Accords, Minivans, and Outback's and so my experience is a bit different than those who been behind the wheel of a BMW or Audi for several years. Personally I didn&#146t notice that much difference in handling characteristics of all the cars so in some readers minds you might feel I&#146m a loon. But here again, they all handled a thousand times better than my Honda so I was dazzled by them all.

Also a lot of reviewers here, as well as in other publications, have commented rather derisively about the styling of the Acura. Personally I think its beautiful. Yes, I can readily see the Honda heritage coming through in its design but I also happen to feel that many of the other cars out there betray their backgrounds in similar ways. And certainly I can see Audis influence in the design of their Passat. The point here is that the attractiveness of any car is clearly in the eye of the beholder ( I can&#146t see why anyone would buy one of those horrid Pontiac Aztecs but that's another story ;-) and I happen to think this a great looking car. In addition on the Type S you get wider, low profile Michelins which look fantastic , nice wheels, and those cool blue Xenon headlights. Plus, I added the rear spoiler  mainly because I was convinced that when I reach really hi speeds taking the kids to school the car would become airborne without it. So its a safety issue I told myself.;-)

The inside of the car, like I said above, felt roomier than the others we drove. Where it comes up short (no pun intended) is in the headroom. Several of my over six foot friends are more comfortable in back than in the front. But who cares. This is my car, not there&#146s,  and I fit in it fine so let &#145em sit in back. I&#146m just 6 foot and I feel the head room is ideal, the leather seats truly comfortable, and the gauges all laid out logically. Plus I love the white dials on the gauges. I know this is not a new thing in cars but, once again, it&#146s new to me and I like it. Also its worth noting that one of the few options you can get on this car, a $3000 navigation system, I passed on. The place it occupies on the dash is where, on my vehicle, the climate controls are. What this means is that, if you have the navi system, your heater, air conditioner, defrost, etc. controls are accessed by touch screen buttons on the Navi monitor in the dash. Personally I can&#146t stand controls like this. Digital speedometers, tachs, climate controls etc. I think  are for the birds. Give me analog gauges and regular switches any day. Coupled with the fact that I always know where I&#146m going ( I am a guy after all ) and the need to operate the controls through that interface led me to pass on this pricey add-on.  That ergonomics of that aside, the heater functioned perfectly and the A/C was as robust as a 105 degree summer day in Sacramento demands.

Beyond that option the list of standard features is fairly large and more or less what you would expect for a car in this class. It has a nice Bose sound system (I think it sounds great) with a 6 cd in dash player (no loading CD&#146s in the trunk...what&#146s up with that), Sunroof (its big too), and heated fully adjustable leather seats. It also has a programmable gizmo mounted just above the rear view mirror that can read the signal from your automatic garage door opener and set it itself up as your new remote. In effect you no longer have to clip the old remote to your visor. Here again you expect to find this feature in expensive cars. Other items are nicely designed and placed drink holders (something critical to my wife in particular) and plenty of storage in the front armrest and glove box.  The back has a fold down arm rest with drink holders as well as  adjustable A/C vents in back and a pass through door from the trunk should you need to stash your skies, curtain rod, or flag pole back there.  All that said was it as plush as the BMW or Audi? Not quite but close in my opinion. But then it&#146s not in the upper $30,000 range either so I can forgive Acura for that.  

Performance wise the car is all I hoped it would be. With that 260 hp six cylinder VTEC Engine ( listen to me, I sound like I know what I&#146m talking about ) it really moves. Shifting in the automatic mode is smooth as silk. Plus a nice feature that we found in all the cars we drove was a Tiptronic shift mode. Basically that's a fancy name for a manual shift mode that lets you control when you shift up or down without the use of a clutch. It&#146s a nice feature and one I use.   Plus, at highway speeds the car is wonderfully quiet on the inside. Its a joy drive anywhere.

What must certainly be clear at this point is that which I stated at the outset. I love this car. Here again I&#146ve not spent any appreciable time behind the wheel of one of those &#147fine German motorcars&#148 so I can&#146t make a comparison to those beyond my brief exposure to them at the dealerships and when we test drove them. That disclaimer aside I feel anyone would be delighted with this car in every respect. Its a great car for the money and one I&#146ve been waiting twenty years for.
