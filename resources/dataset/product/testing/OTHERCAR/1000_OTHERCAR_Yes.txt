            We ordered our Matrix XR, FWD, Stick Shift in November and picked it up at the dealer the first week of January.  No rattles, stereo sounds great (6 CD Changer - 6 speakers), and the car runs like a top.  I have no issue at all with the exceleration, but wasn't expecting 6 cylinder performance.  The acceleration is on par with the 4 cyl Camry we turned in.  We have 2 yr old twins, and the back seats accomodate their car seats with plenty of room to spare, and the seats are at a very good height for putting them in, and taking them out.  There is enough room in the storage area for 2 strollers (stacked on one another), plus for groceries. Without the strollers the height of the storage area allows for an above average space for packages, etc.  Besides being a spacious family car we can take out the car seats and lay the back seats down and accomodate a ton of boxes, etc., should I decide to clean out the basement and/or garage.  I like the dashboard layout, and the faux chrome treatment.  Placement of the shift lever, and shifting gears is comfortable, as is the placement of the steering wheel.  View of the instruments is partially blocked by the steering wheel, but is not any different from any other car I've driven.  Car runs very nice, and to be honest I haven't even opened the hood yet to see the engine, nor did I take a test drive at the dealer when we purchased it. Been driving Toyotas all my life and have never been disapointed before.  Love the separate hatch opening for very easy access to storage, and the rear hatch door opening for putting in larger items.  I give an A  for design and drivability.
