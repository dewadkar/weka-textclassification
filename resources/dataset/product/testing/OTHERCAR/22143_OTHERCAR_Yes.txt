            I've had my Kodak DC215 Zoom Digital Camera since Christmas.  I had been wanting to purchase a digital camera for a while and had been looking around at different cameras.  When I found this one, I found that the picture quality was really good for this price range.  I just love having a digital camera for the convienence.  I am able to take pictures, then immediately down load them and e-mail them to out of town friends and family members.  (The grandparents just love this too!)  I've even used it for action photos at my son's basketball games.  It comes with a built in flash and settings for reducing red-eye and for action photos.  The camera was $400.00, but I've seen it for less since Christmas time.

It comes with a 4MB memory card for storing pictures, this holds about 12 pictures (at the highest quality setting).  I didn't like the fact that I had to pay an additional $100.00 for a larger memory card (32MB).  I also purchased a Digital Film Reader (another $100.00) for faster down load time.  This is where the company makes the extra money, selling the additional accessories.  They should have a package deal or give you a discount on accessories when you purchase their camera.

All in all, I feel that this purchase was well worth the investment.<br><br>
