             The Agfa ePhoto 780 is at best, a decent buy. It has acceptable quality and also , the quality is adjustable. When you adjust the quality, the camera will store less pictures, which is a bit annoying. I do like the option though, because sometimes the pictures do not have to be crystal clear. It also has a time flash on it which is very helpful in group or self photo's . The LCD, or liquid crystal display, it very clear and helps when taking large pictures. The downside of this is, that the camera eats batteries like crazy. I would suggest buying some rechargables and a charger if you want to make this camera worth while. <br><br>
