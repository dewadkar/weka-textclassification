            The Subaru Forester is based on the Impreza platform and has been around for quite a while.  The Forester claims "best in class" 4 cyl power with 165 HP.  This is a 2.5 ltr SOHC flat four with horizontal pistons.  This is the only area that the Forester can even consider outdistancing the new SATURN VUE.  This new SUV from Saturn will feature a unique VTi variable transmission that automatically puts the power where it is needed.  Size wise the VUE is a larger vehicle with 7 more inches on its wheelbase.  Passenger room is similar between the two so you will have to try them on for size, and the VUE will be able to tow up to 2500 pounds, the size of a ski boat.  With the VUE's advanced size and features and of course Saturn's famous dent resistant doors it is worth a trip to you Saturn Store for a view of the VUE this fall when it becomes available.
