            I own a 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited(ZJ). I have the 4.0L version with the AW-4 tranny.

I have been off-roading my ZJ since 1997 and have driven it harder then 99% of Grand Cherokee owners. The only breakdown I have had was a front CV joint go bad due to sand entering the CV joint boot.

On the positive side, I have driven my ZJ 1600 miles one way, wheel it hard for 4-5 days, then drive home. No problems. i've done this twice a year for the last 2 years. I have built mine up over the years to include a 5" lift, 32" tires, on board air compressor (engine driven), and steel front bumper with winch. My Jeep sees serious abuse and keeps going. This is my daily driver, I've put over 60,000 miles on it over the last 3 years.

So, I'm not sure what this guy's real issues are but, from my experiences, and friends that wheel Grand Cherokees, we have nothing but praise for these vehicles. That literally take a beating and keep on ticking.
