            When the gas prices went way up in the spring, it was time to trade in my beloved Chevy truck and find something that was better on gas. I have a favorite dealership so I tried to find a car on their lot. After driving a few different cars, I settled on the 1998 Saturn SL that was on their lot. Needless to say, I love it! We have a family car but my Saturn is the car I drive to and from work. Work is 17 miles each way so I needed something that was great on gas mileage. Driving around town only, the car gets at least 30 miles per gallon. That's my kind of car!!

This is the first Saturn I have ever owned and I will look for another one when it's time. This car was used with 44,000 miles on it. I haven't had it in the shop yet and it runs great. I change the oil faithfully every 2500-3000 miles. The car is a 5-speed so I suppose that helps a little on the gas mileage. I have a few kids and they ride comfortably in the backseat when we take the car anywhere. We don't take the car on trips because there isn't a whole lot of room but it's great for short distances.

Well, what else can I say about this little car? The trunk is huge, it shifts easily and has alot of spunk! And the price was reasonable and fit into my budget.<br><br>
