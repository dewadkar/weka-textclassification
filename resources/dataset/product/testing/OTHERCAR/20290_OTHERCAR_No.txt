            I first got my Nissian Sentra back in 98.  I wanted a car that was inexpensive, but also attractive.  When I first saw it, I fell in love with it!It was exactly the car that I pictured myself driving.  And the price wasn't so bad either. But, my impressions now, apposed to my impressions when I first got it are quite different.

Dont get me wrong I love my car.  But, a few months after I purchased it everything started falling apart.  The radio clock, no matter how many times you set it to the right time, it falls behind.  The tape player seems to be fine but it has eaten a few tapes.  And the brakes always needs to be fixed way before their suppose to.  Another bad thing about it is that it's so small, hardly no room at all.  I live in Cincinnati, Ohio and half the year is winter, which means snow and lots of it.  I don't feel safe in this car when the roads are bad, becuase of it being so small.

Other than what I have said the Nissian Sentra is a pretty good car.  But I wish I would have gotten a different, more roomy car.<br><br>
