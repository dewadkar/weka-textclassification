Eats batteries an adapter is a must when Down loading and viewing your photos. Price was very important in purchasing the camera and it had specs. comparable to more expensive ones.Photos taken were clear and precise and the enlargements turned out (8x11) were framed and friends and family were surprised to find out that they were taken on a digital camera.Photos taken at a family reunion were E-mailed to Ireland and Australia and compliments were returned about the quality of the photos and Inquiries as to the make and model of the camera were made.<br><br>
