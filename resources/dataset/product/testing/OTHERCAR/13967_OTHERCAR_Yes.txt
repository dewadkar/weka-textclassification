            I've owned five; count 'em FIVE MR2's. Think I like em?
The two old bodies (85; 86) were just FUN, and reliable as dawn. My 1991 Turbo is a whole different animal, and I still wax it once a month! I love it!

The new MR2 Spyder reminds me much more of my early MR2's as opposed to the turbo. I purchased mine used from dealer, in Solar Yellow, with TRD ground effects. This thing knocked my socks off on the lot--if not on the road. But the 138hp engine is well-torqued, and with Toyota's Variable Valve Timing, power is through all gears.

I curbed a wheel my first day, and a replacement ran me $200. Nevertheless, this car is one big smile to drive. I parked next to a Miata today, and understood instantly why I chose the MR2.

It's reliable as all get out, fun to drive--just don't expect turbo-type power. The wind deflector actually works well, and it corners like a dream!

Just understand that when you drive this car, the rest of the world slows down to watch you, and you'll make many trips through those five gears!

The stereo has excellent (large) analogue numbers, but the sound is average or a little better. You really have to crank it on the open road, and you pray the speakers don't buzz (they haven't yet, but...). Has a cassette and CD player, but no cruise control on my 2000 model.

If you want pure fun over power, enjoyment over room, and the looks of envy from more people than you could ever imagine--get a Spyder in Solar Yellow!
