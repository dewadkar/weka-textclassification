            In 1988 i bought this mercedes benz 300CD coupe I nicknamed &quot;cedes&quot;.I loved it and you never go un-noticed.Back then was still in great condition and it still is! I've had a cadilliac we bought in 1992 ,it was a &quot;1988&quot;Eldorado.It's setting outside by the shop ,waiting for repair to it's dash computer and a dozen other little things.Guess what I'm driving again...yeah,you're right! If you want a used car that's going to last ,buy the best,Mercedes.By the way the Mercedes and the Cadilliac were the same price when purchased,and were both 7 years old when we bought them.&quot;Cads&quot; are nice but I'd rather buy a used mercedes then a new cadilliac,if all things were equal.<br><br>
