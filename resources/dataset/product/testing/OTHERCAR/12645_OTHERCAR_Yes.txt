            I bought the Canon PowerShot S100 digital camera last November (2000). This is the small, 2.1 megapixels version of the series. I love it! I selected this model because it is small in size. The picture quality is outstanding! Zoom Browser EX is one of the bundled software programs which is exceptionally great for compressing the pictures to send via e-mail. Yes, it was pricey ($599) but has been worth every penny so far. This is one nice Camara. I have droped it twice a yet it still is working great.The price on this camara continues to drop. It is sure to be one of the best values that I see on the market
