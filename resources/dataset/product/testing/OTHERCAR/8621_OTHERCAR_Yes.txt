            You know your life has changed when you trade in your red sport coupe for a minivan.  When I was pregnant with our first child, we knew we would be needing a larger vehicle.  At first we were looking a sport utilities, then I imagined trying to get a baby and a car seat in/out of them and did not want the struggle.  And I did not want to feel like I was driving a truck.  Then we began shopping for minivans.  We researched Consumer reports, and this site and decided to go with the Honda Odyssey.  We purchased an LX because we read the only complaint was the automatic doors so we decided to go without.

Here is what I like:
1.  VERY EASY to put a car seat in and out of the middle seat.  Also very easy to put my baby in and out.  I have plenty of room to stand on the floor board and strap him in.  When I pick him up out of the seat, I  do not worry about hitting his head on the roof.

2.  Can put just about anything in the back...we have lugged wagons, oversized carriages, over-sized rockers, etc. when you put the seat down, there is a lot of storage in the back and height-wise there is a lot of room....we do not have to collapse our baby carriage, we just roll it right up!

3.  The front seats have you sit very high up and you have very good visibility as a driver.

4.  Very easy to maneuver through parking lots.  Drives and handles like a car.

5.  Little ad-ons: rear adjusting air condition, "flip-up" cup holder in the front seat area, great storage in front, comfortable seats.
