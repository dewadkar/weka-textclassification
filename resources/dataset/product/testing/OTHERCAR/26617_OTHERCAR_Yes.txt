            When I found out a new baby was on the way mine and my wife's mustangs just wouldn't cut it, so we had to find a new car.  I settled on the PT because there is plenty of room for the carseat and still plenty in the hatch area too.  

The 4 position shelf in the rear of the car has 1001 uses..one of which is a great changing table for a baby.  It can also act as a table for picnicing or tailgating, and it has hooks for your grocery bags.  With the 65/35 fold, tumble remove rear seats and fold flat front seat, the hauling options are unreal.  This was one of my main considerations was the ability to haul the occasional small appliance or wood pieces etc...

I just passed 3,000 miles on mine, I average around 20 mpg with a mix of city/hwy driving.  The PT is so much fun to drive, very quiet inside, handles well just enough feedback from the steering but not too much.  Stiff, but not too stiff suspension.

All in all the 2003 PT Cruiser is the perfect all around family car for those who want something cooler than a minivan and less cliche' than an SUV.
