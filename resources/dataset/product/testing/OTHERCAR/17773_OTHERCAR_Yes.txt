            Saturn as a company treats their customers as people not just as dollar signs.  That is something that I find extremely important when considering who to give your money to.  Well, anyway, I go to college 6 hours away from home in Rochester, a cold nasty climate.  This car has put up with so much.  It's a 95 with 127,000 miles on it and it has not broken down once.  It never complains, always runs, heats up quick, and is very reliable.  If you are in cold though, the wiper fluid sprayers freeze up and so do the handles occasionally.  But otherwise, it's great for the cold.  The newer models may not have these problems so you should check them out.  My Saturn gets good gas mileage too and I change it's oil every 3 months.  It does get pretty uncomfortable on the 4th straight hour of driving but I think most cars would.  They are also pretty inexpensive which is something I am sure is of concern to most people.  If you are shopping for a car for your kids, I suggest a Saturn.  Good solid cars for a decent price.  They also don't go that fast which may put some minds at ease.  I won't buy any other car myself.<br><br>
