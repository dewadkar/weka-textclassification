            �Hi.  My name is illini and, well, uh, I have a problem.  I admit it.  I drive a Suburban.  There, I said it.  I�m one of those annoying people who terrorize subcompact cars and make parking lots a living hell.  It feels so good to finally come clean.�

(WARNING WARNING WARNING:  This is NOT a technical review.  This is my experience as a regular person driving a vehicle.  Don�t bother to read this if you�re looking for specifications, stats, capacities, etc!)

After much debate in our house, we (read I) decided it was finally time to purchase a new SUV.  Our 1994 Suburban had 160,000 miles.  It was still running fine, but little things were going wrong here and there.  And I admit, I just wanted a new car.  I was vehemently against another Suburban.  It just feels like driving a bus to me.  I wanted a Tahoe or Expedition.  Mr. illini, however, refused to get me anything but a Suburban.  His theory was that with two kids already, and hopes of one or two more in the next two (or maybe five) years, it�s just more practical.  Since I have this major aversion to minivans, we didn�t have much choice.  

Shopping for a new car is never fun and we found out it�s even worse with a two-year-old and a one-year-old.  (I also have an aversion to babysitters, but I�m making progress.)  Therefore, I declined to test drive a new Suburban.  Hubby drove it and reported that it was just like any other Suburban, so I figured there was no need to try it out.  I just picked the color�black�and a few options.  Imagine my surprise when I drove it to the grocery store.  The new 2001 Chevy Suburbans are fabulous!  Well, maybe not fabulous in the general sense, but when compared to the old model it really does apply.

The body style changed for the 2000 model.  It�s a bit sleeker, with corners more rounded.  The biggest difference is the height.  When parked next to our old one, it is at least six inches higher.  When driving, this is even more obvious.  Were the old ones high enough?  Of course.  But I have to say, I really like feeling that I can see around those tall Ford SUVs.  (I know what all you subcompact car drivers are saying about ME right now!)

After some debate, we selected the LS model for two reasons.  One, living in South Texas, leather can be a mistake, especially in a black vehicle.  The LT model comes ONLY with leather.  The other reason we selected the LS model is because my husband preferred the front bench seat (LS model only).  This allows room for an additional passenger, though I can�t imagine actually having NINE people in the car with me.  The main thing my hubby, who is 6�6� tall, liked about it is that it allows for a bit more leg room.  There is no console on the floor between the driver and front passenger.  In the models with bucket seats, there is a console that goes between the seats entirely up to the dash.  Guess hubby was banging his knees on the console.  The console for the bench seat is actually the �seatback� of the middle seat folded down.  Obviously, if you have a third passenger in the front seat, you will not have a console.  It doesn�t hold very much (maybe about 10 CDs), but it�s more than enough for us.  

The turning radius on the 2001 Suburban is superb for a vehicle of this size.  I can actually get into a normal size parking space that has cars parked in the adjoining spots!  At first, I thought I�d just performed an amazing feat of driving but then hubby told me that they�d improved it on the new models.  Bottom line is this:  you don�t need to have a commercial license to park this bad-boy at the mall.  

Another improvement is the acceleration.  You don�t want to peel out in a Suburban and would look like an idiot trying it.  However, it does have pretty decent acceleration for a vehicle of this size and if you need to floor it to get out of someone�s way, there is some power there.  

In general, I find it very easy to drive.  The brakes respond well (though we received a notice they�d had some complaints about the responsiveness of the brakes and that we could have them adjusted if we wished) as does the steering.  For such a large vehicle, it is quite easy to handle.  

The 2001 Chevy Suburban also features front seat side-impact airbags.  They are located on the sides of the seats and deploy between the passenger and the door.  Chevy is relatively vague on the threshold for deployment of these airbags and states merely that they will go off in �moderate to severe� side impact collisions.  Definite bonus points to Chevy for adding a non-mandated safety feature.

One of my other favorite features is the 3rd seat.  It now can be folded up and latched inside the cargo area, thus providing additional cargo space without the hassle of lugging its considerable heft out of the truck and into the garage.  Plus you don�t have to be a weight-lifting octopus to fold it up.  If you do get really desperate for space, you can remove it totally but in the folded position it only takes up about 8-10� of space.  (I know you subcompact owners are laughing at me again for needing to fold the 3rd seat up to get more cargo space!)  

Getting to the third seat, however, is not a favorite feature.  You can either scoot 1/3 of the middle seat forward and squeeze your way into the back, or you can fold the seat forward, then fold the back over on top of that and climb your way back.  Did that confuse you?  Well, it should because it confuses me and I own it!  There has got to be a better way to get back there and I challenge Chevy to find it.  If you will really need to use the 3rd seat on a regular basis, I would suggest getting an LT model that has front and middle bucket seats.  The design is much more like a mini-van and you get to the third seat by going between the middle bucket seats.   

One drawback about the 2001 Suburban is the size of the gas tank.  Remember, this thing sucks up gas at the rate of about 13mph in town and 18mph on the highway.  The gas tank holds only about 30 gallons, which is considerably less than the �old� model.  It�s not a very big deal for me as I don�t drive that much but for someone on the road a lot, it could be a hassle.

Wanna hear the really cool part?  They no longer tell you that you MUST change your oil every 3,000 miles.  (Only certain kinds of driving really warrant this, though most mechanics won�t admit it and certainly not the car manufacturers.)  Now there is an oil change indicator which lights up when you need to change your oil.  Granted, I�m not sure how much I trust it so I do check the oil myself every so often to make sure it�s still good.  We drove about 5000 miles before needing our first oil change.  

I know you�re asking how comfortable it is.  It�s not as comfy as my couch, but it�s better than a regular car.  Actually, it�s kind of a cross between the two.  There�s plenty of leg and head room even for my built-like-a-linebacker hubby.  The seats are cushy and comfy and the front seats recline waaaaay back (do NOT drive or ride with the seat reclined, though!).  I�ve only ridden in the back seat a couple of times, but it, too, was quite comfortable though I missed having a high-backed seat.  There was plenty of leg room back there for me at 5�11�.  As for the ride itself, I find it to be exceptionally smooth.  You do not feel every little bump and dip in the road as you would expect.  Of course, it feels bumpier in the rear seat but it's still a nice, easy ride.  

Overall, I actually like the 2001 Chevrolet Suburban.  For such a behemoth, it handles and performs well.  It is comfortable and has the safety features I want.  It is not, however, a vehicle for everyone.  Just please, please, please don�t hate me because I drive a Suburban.

(Note:  We paid $27,000 but sticker was $35,500)
