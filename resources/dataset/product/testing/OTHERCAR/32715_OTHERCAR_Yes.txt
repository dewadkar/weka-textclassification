            If you think this car is just another HUGE car, maybe its about time you gave this vehicle a second thought. At 18, I have to admit, its a car that I didn't want to be caught dead in because of its reputation as an old person's car. Its true that most of the buyers are rather old, but it doesn't mean at all that a younger person wont enjoy driving this car. I do.

I don't have many bad things to say about this car, maybe that's because the good qualities far outweigh any of the bad. The first good thing, is that the Town Car is a substantial car; there's room for everything including yourself!! That's only a minor part; I'd have to say that my favorite part about the car, besides the size, is that it is SMOOOOOOTHE; its like no other smoothness I've ever felt... it's so graceful at it. Let's say, the car is rocking (as it tends do after a larger bump)... it's not just any rocking, it's an amazing rock! It feels like the body motions were engineered specifically for that! It's so relaxing, I can barely explain it with words! I'm not sarcastic, I'm telling the truth! 

The engine is also smooth too... it's a big, powerful, 4.6 liter SOHC V8 engine that never feels like its actually doing any work and at the same time, can dispatch many sporty cars in a stop light brawl (0-60 in about 8 secs... faster than a base mustang). When you step on the gas, an amazing V8 rumble rips out!

Things I don't like:
Transmission is a bit unrefined.
Steering feels elasticy.

All in all, this is a great car for what's it's designed to do... be relaxing to drive. I do have to say, If you have a couple of extra grand, go for the Cadillac Deville... it's a much better package.<br><br>
