            I own three ('90 80Q, '91 90, 95 90Q) Audi's and this is my oldest and highest mileage car of the bunch.....and it's still my favorite!!!

At the moment it has 206,000 miles on it.  It runs like a dream has tons of ample space for me and it's so easy to work on.  The quattro (AWD)  system is unbelievable in the snow...it's every bit as good as the 4x4 Jeep Cherokee that it replaced.  Except that with the quattro you get AWD all the time and the lower profile makes it MUCH better in the wind....not to mention gas mileage (22-27 mpg)!!

My car is a 5-spd manual with a 2.3L 10v 5 cyl engine.  It's supposed to put out 130hp and 140 ft-lbs of torque.  I also have an 1991 90 with the same motor but it's an automatic....you would swear the cars have completely different motors.  The 5-spd manual makes that much of a difference!!

The thing I love about the car is how easy it is to work on.  Parts are expensive from the dealer but you can find them reasonably priced on the web.  They are initially hard to work on but once you learn the tricks they are really quite easy!!  

The worst thing about the car (Audi's in general) is the dealers.  They tend to be very rude and hard to deal with.  My local dealer is constantly giving me the wrong parts for my cars, it's to the point now that I only go there when it's a &quot;dealer only&quot; item.  I'm not talking about unusual parts either.....drain plug seals, oil filters....how hard can it be??  I've argued with them many times about the part only to have to drive home and then back to the dealer to get the correct part....the one that I said it was!!

The performance is good considering the age of the car.  Like most (older) Audi's the performance off the line is nothing special but once you hit cruising speeds (50+ mph)....LOOK OUT.  The car loves to get driven once it's up in that range.  It's quite fast when you consider the weight and engine of the vehicle.

Everyday that I drive it I'm amazed that there is 206k miles on it...it really is still that smooth.  There is no oil consumption at ALL!!!  Quite often I will drive around town just to drive the car around, especially after a good snow fall!!!

This car is for anyone who REALLY likes to drive cars.  It would also be well suited for people who enjoy doing much of there own maintenance (because of the dealers).  If you want a point A to B car do NOT get this car.  Get this car if you really enjoy driving!!<br><br>
