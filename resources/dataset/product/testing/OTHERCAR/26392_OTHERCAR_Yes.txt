            Sure am glad we bought this one!  Our new Olds Silhouette is our fourth minivan, and it's the best one yet.  The features and little extras were worth the few dollars more than we would have paid for the Chevy Venture.  We don't regret going with Olds for one minute.

This is a smooth-riding van with lots of leg room and very little interior noise.  (The optional headsets for the rear passengers also help with keeping the noise level down!)

Handles well on ice and snow as well as dry roads.  Good gas mileage for this type of vehicle.  No shakes, shimmies or strange noises when you try for a little extra speed.

The only complaint is the front cupholders; they just don't cut it!  All the great options and they can't make a decent cupholder.  Oh well.  We love it anyway.<br><br>
