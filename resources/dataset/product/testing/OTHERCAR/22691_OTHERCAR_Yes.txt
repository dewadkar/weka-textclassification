            My 1991 Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais coupe has been a good little car for me.  Its desirable combination of sportiness, interior amenities, and engine pep make it a great choice for a young person on the go.

I got this car as my sixteenth birthday present, about three years ago.  At that time, it had roughly 70,000 miles on it and was in excellent shape, inside and out.  Since then, I have used the car predominantly as transportation to and from work and high school.  In that time I've put about 30,000 miles on it (it's almost at 100,000 now), and the car's never missed a beat.

Mechanically, there have been only two relatively minor problems I've had.  The first, and more severe, was when the lockout cylinder went out about a year ago.  What was happening was that once I'd been driving for a while and the engine was hot, whenever I would accelerate from a stop or decelerate to a stop, the engine would stall.  I took it to a mechanic, he correctly diagnosed it, and the problem was solved.  The other problem occurred when I broke the exhaust pipe off at the manifold going over a speed bump and had to have the whole thing replaced.  Ever since then, the catalytic converter has rattled under the car.  It's not hurting anything, but it can be VERY irritating.

On the whole though, I've been very happy with the car.  The engine is one of the best four cylinders ever made.  It's called a Quad 4, and it has four valves per cylinder, dual overhead cams, and is rated at 170 hp (I believe).  It's quite peppy and has great pickup, but once you get a couple of people in the car, you feel the pinch.  The interior is quite good, especially up front.  There's plenty of legroom and headroom, and the instruments and controls are attractive and well-placed.  The car handles pretty well, and the braking is very good.  The automatic transmission is responsive and crisp.  The factory sound system is surprisingly good.

I would recommend this car to near anyone, most especially to a teenaged driver.  The combination of sporty looks, good performance,a nice sound system, and simple economy (30 mpg highway) makes it an ideal choice.
