            I purchased this truck in November of 1998. When searching for a new 4 wheel drive quality and price were the first considerations but comfort was also very important. Not only does this truck have a haul/tow option that improves engine performance but it rides like a luxury sedan. The ergonomic adjustment in both front seats gives total back support and comfort for those long drives. the drivers ability to reach all controls with ease and the added options of extra ac/dc outlets allows adding a laptop and cell phone and a charger or numerous other devices that can be used all at the same time. With all the power you can ask for from the vortex engine and excellent gas mileage driving this truck for the last year has been a pleasure. I also think the third door makes shopping so much earier and the rear seat is incredibly roomy.<br><br>
