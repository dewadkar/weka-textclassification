            I bought a new Saab 900 SE Turbo (2dr, stickshift) in 1995 when I lived in Massachusetts and needed a fast, safe car for a very long commute, much of which was through mountain roads.  The seats in my Ford Probe were giving me a backache (not to mention the jokes I got about its name).  Anyway.  The Audi A4 was too slow, and I couldn't see myself in a Bimmer (plus, I wanted FWD or AWD in case I hit snow).  

I've had this car now for four years and it's been great.  This version of the 900 is extremely fast and handles very well. Be warned, though: A friend has the grown-up version from the same year (V6, auto, fourdoor) and it's a piece of junk - it handles like bus and the  engine groans like a Chevette. Steer clear.  

The 900 SET is very comfortable for two skinny people.  The cabin is very narrow, though, and you'll be rubbing shoulders if the two of you aren't svelte -- and the window lift switches, in the center console, will end up sandwiched between your thighs.  Speaking of which, the Saab has that quirky key in between the seats, which means the key doesn't dangle from the steering column and tickle your knee all the time.  Chicks dig it.  I don't know why.

The 900 will haul a TON of stuff.  The hatchback area is huge and the rear seats also fold down (though not flat). You can move really big chairs, tall plants, and many many many book boxes.  

Driving it: The adverts about low-end torque are B.S.  This thing has wicked turbo lag and if you need power below 2500 rpm, fuggedaboutit.  Take the hit and shift down or that Yugo will be passing you.  And when you do stab it, hang on to the wheel, 'cause the torque steer will yank the car to one side.  Front drive means understeer past the limit.  ABS brakes are excellent. Once you learn to handle the drivetrain, you'll be having a blast.  It handles beautifully in the mountains and cruising at 100 is a walk in the park.  But there's more wind noise (espec. above 85) than I would expect in this level of car.

Over four years and 32,000 miles, this car has had only one major breakdown (sprung coolant hose, fortunately two blocks from a Saab dealer - how did it know?). Everything else (weak battery, loose shift knob) has been handled during regular servicing.  It has lately developed some annoying rattles, though.  Mileage is not great (under 20, but when you drive like me what do you expect).  Aside from parking lot dings, it still looks great inside and out.

Other things to consider: Even the top-line stereo doesn't pump out enough volume for those times you really want to crank it, though sound quality is good.  Trip computer is fun, and its UI is quirky but easy. Automatic climate control is great and has plenty of capacity for extreme outside temps.  And heated seats -- mmm, toasty.  

If I were in the market today I'd consider the newer 9-3 Viggen (too much power for this platform?), Audi S4, and new BMW 3-series (I no longer live near snow). But I'm not. I like this car and will be keeping it for a long time.<br>
