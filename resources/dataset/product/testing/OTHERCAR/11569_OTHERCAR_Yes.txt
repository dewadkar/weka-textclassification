            I first owned a 1996 Jeep and absolutely loved it. It was very dependable and never let me stranded in the three years I owned it.  In fact, one winter several years ago, I had to take my boy to Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh. I had a two hour trip at four in the morning in a blinding snowstorm, but that Jeep (and a lot of prayers) got us there. It ran like a machine and I was able to pass numerous vehicles that were stuck.

Then last year, I decided to trade my 1996 in on a 1999 Sport. Since then, I've had no mechanical problems. Faced with one of the worse winters in quite a while, I was able to go just about anywhere I wanted.

The vehicle is perfect for hauling two kids plus their junk back and forth to practice or driving six hours on vacation. It has plenty of room and does well on gas for a truck.

In our area, you can't go more than a mile without passing or seeing one along the road. They are very popular and reasonably priced (2001, 35,000 miles, $10,500).

I love Jeeps and would recommend the truck to anyone who wants a dependable, workhorse that looks and drives great!
