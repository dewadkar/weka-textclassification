            Bought our '99 brand new, after a thorough comparison with a number of other makes (Audi, BMW, etc.). Frankly I was sold on the style from the start-it's classy, but in a subtle way. We've been delighted with it since we picked it up, 35,000 miles ago. I still find reasons we need to go on a drive!

The interior is very nicely laid out. It's clear that the car was designed from the perspective of the driver and passengers, as all the controls are easy to find and there are neat gadgets and gizmos galore. After two years I'm spoiled--heated seats, climate control, radio controls on the steering wheel, wipers on the headlights, fold down back seats, and others that I'm now taking for granted. Seats are great- we got the leather ones. Also got the sunroof and upgraded audio system (a rare early model that the dealer had on the lot - our luck). 

Early on we had to get the ECM replaced (it's the computer chip that controls the engine), after experiencing some smoking at start-up. Our dealer gave us a loaner and it was done within a few hours. Other than that we've not had any problems.

Drives very nicely in the winter. We put 4 snows on it and we can go anywhere in this awful New England weather. 

Con: could use more power--like when entering a highway. Overall it has great power, but there have been a couple of times (usually times involving large trucks) that I would have liked just a bit more oomph. (We have the basic 4, 170hp, model). Not a serious problem, but something to be aware of.

A good friend brought a 2000 last year - he's also crazy about his. 

I love this car. We leased it and I fully expect we'll buy it when the lease runs out.
