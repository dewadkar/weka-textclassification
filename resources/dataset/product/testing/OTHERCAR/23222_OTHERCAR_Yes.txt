            When my husband and I learned in early 1996 that we were expecting our first child, we knew that we had to buy a larger, safer car for me to drive.  And, quite frankly, my expanding size wasn't fitting so well behind the wheel of my 1973 Karmann Ghia.  So, I began to do some research.  As recent college graduates carrying a HUGE load of student loan debt, we needed something very affordable, but we also needed something roomy enough for a growing family, plus we wanted some basic amenities.  Our local newspaper ran a featured article on the new Plymouth Breeze, and it sounded perfect for us.  The base price, $14,000, was desirable, as was the cab forward design and reasonably priced options.  

As soon as I got behind the wheel, I fell in love with my car.  It rides smoothly, even at higher speeds, and I really like the cab forward design.  The back seat is large enough for multiple carseats, but it will also hold 3 adults with enough leg room.  The trunk room is also wonderful.  I can buy 2 weeks' worth of groceries for a family of four and fit it all in that trunk!  

Of course, we have had our share of unfortunate problems with our car, many of which we chalk up to it being the 1996 model - the first model year for this car.  I truly believe that the manufacturer did not iron out all of the problems before they put it into production.  We have had several problems, from a bad universal joint (we found it before it went out, thanks to a recall), to the blowout of the front cam seal!  The dealership was amazed at the cam seal problem, because the car still has less than 20,000 miles on it.  Needless to say, they provided us with a free rental car and repair.

Despite our unusual problems with the Plymouth Breeze, I honestly do love my car.  I'm a smaller person, and I find that I sit up higher in this car than I have in others, and that helps me feel more confident, which in turn helps me be a better driver.  My husband has urged me repeatedly to buy a different car, but I remain loyal.  I recommend the Plymouth Breeze to you...just don't buy the 1996 model! :)<br><br>
