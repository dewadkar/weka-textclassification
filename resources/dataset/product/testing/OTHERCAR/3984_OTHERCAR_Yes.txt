            I recently got the L series wagon and I love it!  We didn't want to go for something as large and expensive as an SUV but we still wanted some room.  We leased a SW2 Saturn before this so we knew the car was reliable while still at a good price, so that brought us back to the dealer.  We have a 16 mo child and with that comes STUFF.  The back end provides ample room and includes a cover so your &quot;stuff&quot; is not on display for the world.  
The sound system is really good (CD player as well as tape) and it's a comfortable ride.  It's fairly quiet, although it could be quieter, which is a big improvement over the '97 Saturn I had.  The car has automatic locks (locks when you put the car in drive and unlocks when you take the key out.)  This is nice in the sense that I have a child but it can also be a bit annoying.
We opted for the V6 engine and I think with a bigger car like this, it is a must!
If you are looking for a car with some room to carry things but don't need or want an SUV then this is the car for you.  It's not the dorky looking station wagon they used to drive on the Brady Bunch and it's a very comfortable car!<br><br>
