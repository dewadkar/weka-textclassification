            My husband and I just bought a new 2000 Civic EX about 2 weeks ago, and I have never been happier with a car.  My sister has a 1998 EX, so I had some insight into the quality beforehand.  We test drove once, and bought that same night.  It is a little small, but right now it's just hubby and me in the family, and even when we do have kids, they'll be in car seats for a while, and by the time they're too big for the back seat, it will probably be time for a new car.  I love the sunroof, and the fact that it has a CD player is nice too!  We got the EX because we wanted antilock brakes, and they only come on the EX.  It's a fairly quiet ride, although we will be getting it undercoated before winter, partially for rust protection and partly for sound insulation.  Instrument placement is good, radio and air/heat almost at eye level.  Instrument panel is very visible, especially at night.  The speedometer, tach, etc. are lit with white light-highly visible and easy on the eyes.  Seats are comfortable, and the glove box is HUGE!!  My husband says I could fit my best friend in there.  Trunk is larger than it looks.  My one complaint with that is that there's no trunk release on the keyless entry remote.  There is one on the floor by the drivers seat, but a botton on the clicker would be nice, too.  The back seat does fold down for hauling larger items.  

We also have a Ford Ranger, and after driving that around, there are times when I feel kind of small on the roads, but I'm getting used to that as I drive the car more and more.  There are some quirks (only one seatback pocket...why??) but all-in-all, it's a great car.  The gas mileage is incredible, and when I'm paying $1.70/gallon, I love that!  I get about the same miles per tank as I got in the Ranger, but the tank is half the size.  I would recommend this car to anyone who's starting out.  It's a great first new car, and will fit our family as long as it needs to.  Can't wait to take it on its first road trip!!<br><br>
