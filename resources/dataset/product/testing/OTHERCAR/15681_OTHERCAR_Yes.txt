<B>Comfort and Amenities:</b><HR>The seats are better than the previous year's C class. The amenities are better and the interior looks so much nicer.<br>
<B>Performance and Handling:</b><HR>Very solid and stable. The acceleration was good and will be sufficient for most people. Its much better than the C240.<br>
<B>Safety:</b><HR>Awesome! Mercedes has always had a reputation for very high safety standards. I was really impressed by the side AND head airbags for the REAR passengers! Since I carry clients all the time, this is very important for me. <br><B>General Comments:</b><HR>I have honestly never liked both the exterior and interior looks of Mercedes Benz cars. I thought they looked bland and boring. I never liked their seats because of how firm they were. In the past, I never thought much of the Mercedes Benz cars that I rode in.<br>

Starting with the all new 2000 models, I really started to like how they looked. I especially love the looks of the new S class. Unfortunately I cannot afford a new S class sedan.  What impressed me so much about the 2001 C320 was how it looks just like the S class sedan. For the first time ever, there is now a Mercedes Benz in my price range that I think looks beautiful!

I am currently shopping around to buy a replacement for my 1995 Volvo 850 GLT sedan.  The cars I am considering are the BMW 528, Lexus GS300, Volvo S60T5, and the C320.
I have crossed out the 528 because of its slow acceleration and very heavy feeling. I feel like I am driving a heavily loaded car, even when it is empty.
I crossed out the GS300 because I didn't think it handled that well.
The new Volvo S60T5 will not come out till the end of October so I have not tested it yet.

At the moment, the C320 is my top choice. What I like best is:

1. Its beautiful exterior and interior. 
2. The powerful V6 engine that can go 0-60 in 6.9 seconds.
3. The safety features that include 10 airbags!
4. The free scheduled maintenance for the first 4 years.
5. The GPS Tele Aid system.
6. The various other advanced high tech features.

The only thing I am not thrilled about is the firm seats. I don't understand why they don't give buyers the option of softer and more comfortable seats. All their competitors do! This is the only weakness that I can think of.

It will be very interesting to see how the brand new Volvo S60 stacks up with the C320.
