            Believe it or not, I bought my Protege5 the minute I saw it - no research at all. I fell in love with it immediately, and I'm definitely happy with my choice. 

The exterior still blows me away. It has a very stylized look that would normally require extra body kits to achieve. The chrome wheels add even more attitude to the appearance of the car, while the rack and sunroof are just as complementary.

The car drives like a dream. The handling is responsive without being overly so. The ABS brakes add to my sense of security, and the ride itself is very comfortable.

There are many generous options available for a reasonable price. The sunroof and 6 disc in-dash changer were must- haves and the cargo net helps hold down all the sports equipment I usually have with me.

It may be the fact that my previous vehicle was a 6-cylinder Accord, but I feel that the Protege5 is a bit underpowered when I merge onto freeways and such. It's not a huge problem, but it is slightly noticeable in situations when extra kick from the engine is desired. Also, the manual transmission can be a little difficult to navigate at first. At 5'8" I had trouble getting used to reaching 3rd and 5th without extending my arm further than I thought was necessary.
