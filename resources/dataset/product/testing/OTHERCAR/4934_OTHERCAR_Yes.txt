            My opinion on this truck is: almost everyone should own one. It's the third one I have owned and I've yet to be dissatisfied with the truck. The Sonoma I own now is a 1998. I have 45,000 miles on it already and haven't had a lick of trouble with it. It's very easy to drive, comfortable and good on gas. The only people that I would recommend not to buy this truck would be someone who is tall or large. I am 5 feet tall and 100 lbs., my Fiance' is 6'2. I fit in the truck perfect, with room to spare. He fits too, but it's a little tight and I know, not near as comfortable for him.
The trucks run well if taken care of and if maintenance is kept up. The first Sonoma I owned was a 1991. I ran that truck up to 185,000 miles when I had it. When I sold it, the only work done on it besides the usual maintenance, was I had changed the starter and the fan clutch. And that little truck was still running strong when I sold it.[only sold it to buy a newer model] I then purchased a 1994 and had the same success with it. Now I drive a 1998 and am just as satisfied with the truck as I ever was. Like I said, they run forever with the proper care, they are excellent on gas, very comfortable and easy to maneuver. I would recommend this truck over and over again!!!




Well, I'm up to 91,000 miles and my truck is still going strong! I have only done the routine scheduled maintenance on it.(oil change, spark plugs, tires, etc.) I still would recommend this truck to almost anyone! I'm still very satisfied. Ten years of driving the Sonoma and I will probably buy another one when the time comes!!

Now I'm up to 130,000 miles. New tires, routine maintenance and one of the plastic AC vents has come unhooked on the interior!! Still not bad for the mileage and the year model...
