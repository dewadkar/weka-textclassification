            The most futuristic thing about this camera is the ability to zoom in on the photos you have already taken using the viewfinder.  You can zoom in all over the image you have taken.  It is like something from a science fiction movie.  I couldn't believe it.  
Digital photography doesn't use film, and is a great way to help save the environment.  The chemical development process will be over in the future.  I am switching to digital.  Make the change to digital.  It's awesome.
Why this camera?  This camera has a great price, and offers usb connectivity.  It is easy to use.  Once I figured out the difference between the display mode and picture taking mode I was on my way to understanding the whole camera.  The software is awesome.  I really like the ability to alter the photos I want using the software.  This camera comes with Adobe photo deluxe 2.0.  Adobe has created an easy to use software application.  I am surprised how easy it is to use.
I do have some problems with the cameras design.  It really seems to use the batteries in a hurry.  Be prepared to have four AA's on hand at all times.  The usb connection port needs a cover.  I can see grit getting in the usb port and ruining the camera. If you plan on being near a computer the 4MB smart media card is enough memory.  If you plan on taking this camera on a trip I would recommend buying a 64MB smart media card.  It is hard to see the display in daylight, but can be adjusted.  
Get a digital camera, it is worth it.  This camera is a good deal.
