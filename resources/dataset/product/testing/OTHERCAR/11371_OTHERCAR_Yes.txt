            Actually there is nothing that I dislike about the 1999 Dodge Caravan.  I love having the extra door. We went on a family trip where there were 2 car seats needed and we did not have to take them with us because they were built in!  The roominess is unbelievable!  The drive was so smooth that you had to be careful of the speed limit.  I am a larger woman therefore I need to be able to move the driver seat back AND be comfortable in my seat belt....yes again the Caravan was great!  The heat/air vents for the back seat and the second seat passengers let everyone be comfortable at the same time.  A basic good quality AM/FM-Cassette was included.  

Anyone with children should purchase this van because of the spaciousness and  sturdiness.

Oh, yes the mileage was good too!<br><br>
