            This car has really grown on me.  When we first got it, I didn't like it much, but after a while I couldn't really find anything bad about it.  We have had it for about six months and have had no major problems with it.  I feel very protected in the car, and so does the rest of my family.  It has many cool features, and I recommend the car very highly.  We have ours fully loaded and it is black.  The four doors are a big step up from the two door Geo models.  You can't find too many safer cars on the road in my opinion.<br><br>
