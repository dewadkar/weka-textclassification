            So, I just buy my Audi TT - everything I need out of a car PLUS my 4 and 7  year old children fit in the back PLUS my wife actually likes it PLUS its  a quattro so it'll handle great.  For all practical purposes, I've died and gone to as good an automotive heaven as I'll get NEW in this lifetime.  So far, so good.

I have the car for a week (just outside NYC) and love it: it truly IS like  &quot;riding on rails&quot;!  Put on about 500 miles with nary a hitch, then a problem I simply hadn't counted on emerged and required immediate attention.  Since nobody - dealer, mechanic, magazine reviews or the internet - mentioned this little snag, I felt it was time to post something about it.  I hope you find this useful.

My problem was snow.  Yes, SNOW!  In a quattro.  Snow: and not much of the  stuff, just 3&quot; of fluffy powder.  But here's what you must know if you want one of these cars - loaded (I hope) - and live in a place where the blacktop can occasionally become white.  These cars come with 16&quot; steel wheels and competent tires standard, but nearly every driver prefers the lower profile 17&quot; tires on the highways and byways.  THESE rims come with a summer rated portenza low profile tire, not even an all-season (why spoil the performance IF your a purist).

Then the flurries begin, and you realize that this car handles like a paper boat in a hurricane.  &quot;WHAT THE HECK IS THIS?!?!?!&quot; you say.  &quot;This is a Quattro!!!!&quot; you say.   &quot;@#*#!%^+?&quot; you say.  Then &quot;ah hah!&quot; you say, &quot;I wonder what kind of tires these are&quot;?  Bingo! Summer tread.  No traction.  A white castle gas attack could blow you off the road in this flurry.  So, having identified the problem, what's a sane fix?  If you've encountered any of this story yourself - or think you may - here's what I did.

Snow Tires.  Yeah, I know, pretty obvious. But NOT SO FAST: which tire?  Here's what I found out:  You can buy the 17&quot; snows for your 17&quot; rims and be done, EXCEPT that if you change these tires on the low profile rims every season, you may eventually put a nick in the bead that holds the air in the wheel AND these tires are too wide to give this car enough bite in the snow (wide tires are great on good roads but bad in snow - narrower is better).  Good 17&quot; snows (michelin, continentals, pirellis, etc.) also
cost about 50% - 60% more then their smaller cousins - about $200 a tire.

More rubber, thinner tire, don't hurt the good rims, don't break the bank, WHAT'S a fella to do?  How about 16&quot; steel rims ($40), 225 or 205x55x16 snows (H rated tires only) at about $135.  We put them on next to a snowfilled parking lot.  Going in to the shop was a nightmare - driving out was a DREAM!  Even in the snow, we're back on rails!  All the confidence is back - and we are ready for the rest.  Highway: Great!  Local roads: Great!  Snow covered street: Great!  All this for less than the cost of the 17&quot; snows, which will now go into storage until spring and emerge from a harsh winter unblemished and ready for action.

What's the downside?  Looks.  You will probably miss those Bugatti-retro wheels they've provided on this car, but the Kharman-ghia style statement made by the steel wheels is more than offset by this simple fact: I will enjoy -  and I mean E-N-J-O-Y -  this car, all winter, all summer, all year long.  Having now solved the only shortcoming I've found in this car, you can take THAT to the bank.<br><br>
