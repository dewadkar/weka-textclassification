            My wife and I had always wanted a Wrangler. Who can blame us, they just scream "style". Of course, it's not the same kind of style that a BMW or a sports-car offers, but it's style just the same.

We bought our first Wrangler when the 1998 model came out. It was a base-model soft-top with the 4-cyl engine. The ride was noisy and bumpy and we loved it! After all, you have to remember that this vehicle was designed for off-road use, not for your typical paved road.

We lived in Colorado during this time and I had to travel up a 6% grade "hill" to work every day. I passed cars left and right that were slowed to a crawl going up that hill. I saw a comment somewhere else about the heater not working, well I'm here to tell you that the heater worked great in the winter.

Anyway, my wife and I loved our Wrangler so much we traded in the next year for a 1999 Sport model with a hard top and other various features. The main difference between our 98 and 99 was the 6-cyl engine we got with the 99 model.

According to Consumer Reports, Wranglers don't score high in reliability, so I'm prepared for the worst. At this point I have 27,000 miles on it and I have brought it in for 3 things:

1) Weather-stripping on passenger door had to be replaced, was leaking
2) Passenger side window became difficult to roll up/down
3) Driver side seat started splitting

Of course, in all three cases repairs were done under warranty.

Someone else mentioned tipping, well, I have found our 1999 Wrangler to be no more "tippy" than any other SUV that I have driven previously. Obviously you can't corner at the same speeds as a car, but what do you expect for a vehicle that has its center of gravity raised high enough to give it 8.5" to 10.5" clearance???
