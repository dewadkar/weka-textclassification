            This past Christmas I was able to retire my Olympus 340R Digital Camera, as I received the Olympus D-490 ZOOM which can take up to 2.1 Mega-pixel shots (1600x1200 pixel resolution).

The picture quality still is not as good as traditional film, but it's getting much better. 

Things I like about this camera:
1. Zoom capability. 3x optical, 2.5 digital telephoto.
2. It can take video (no audio) clips as well, though they eat up storage fast. Video format is MPEG.
3. If you want ultra high quality you can take shots in TIFF format (all other formats are JPEG).
4. Camera settings are easy to adjust. From exposure length, to brightness, you adjust these settings using the software and color LCD screen on the back.
5. It uses the paper thin postage-stamp type memory cards.
6. This camera is *much* more power usage efficient than my 340R. This is a big problem for digital cameras as they eat so many batteries. I'm still using the batteries that came w/ my 490 and I've taken over 300 pictures and have used the LCD display extensively.

Things I don't like about the camera:
1. *Major* design flaw! When you "open" the camera lens cover to take a shot, you cannot close it again until the picture has been fully stored. This means you sit there for a few seconds just waiting before the lens retracts so you can close the cover. This is an awful oversight in design.
2. Camera's a little bulky for a point-and-shoot.
3. Out of the box memory card is 8Mb which only gives you like a dozen high-quality shots. I upgraded to the 64Mb card which is great.
4. If the camera indicates that it could use the flash, you have to pop it up by hand. Bizzarre!
