            I love my '99 Discovery. I've driven the Explorer, and Grand Cherokee, Pathfinder and 4-Runner and none compare to the Land Rover. The Land Rover is a truck that drives like a car. It is not as "bumpy" a ride like it's competitors. Also, the amount of room in the rear of the truck is wonderful. I especially like the rear door and how it opens like a regular door - getting grocery bags in the truck has never been so easy. 

My truck has every option, including the heated seats which is an absolute must! You don't want to get out of your comfortable seat on a cold winter day.
I recently tested my truck in the snow....and it went through it all - no hesitations. 

The cabin inside the truck is a little noisy at times. I think this is due to the non aero-dynamically design of the truck. But, if I wanted smoothe and quiet, I'd buy a BMW.

As for handling, I am quite surprised with this truck. Looking at the truck one would think that it would role easily b/c it is very boxy. However, because of it's extremely heavy weight (more than a BMW 740) it hugs the road very well.

I've read some reviews that talk about the expense and upkeep, however, I suppose that's the price we pay for having such finely engineered cars. No worse than a BMW, Mercedes, or Jaquar I'm sure. I took out an extended warranty for this car. It was under $1000 and covers everything except "wear and tear" and is good for the next 5 years, unlimited miles. You can't go wrong with that. 

I give this truck 4 1/2 stars.....5 is for the Range Rover.
