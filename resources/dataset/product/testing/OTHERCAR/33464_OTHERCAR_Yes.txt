            A friend of mine is into camping and has a huge fifth wheel travel trailer, so to pull it, he bought the 2001Chevrolet Silverado LT 3500, extended cab, 4WD with the Duramax 6600 turbo diesel V8. 

This baby is beautiful and big! It is a medium charcoal gray metallic in color with a black looking leather interior.  It has those camper mirrors on it that you can extend out several inches to give you a better view. Room for three people in the back and three up front. The leg room in the back is quite comfortable, I wouldnï¿½t recommend three adults in the back or front, two adults and a child in the middle will sit comfortable. The front seat has the center seat that can fold down with a storage compartment built in it. 

The 3500 and 2500 Silverado has a slight difference in looks,(Compared to the 1500) you will see a raised hood and a grill with a honey comb look to it.

Standard is a six-way power bucket seats with built in seat heaters. There is a memory of what positions the seats where in depending on which of the two keys you put in the ignition. 

Dual front airbags with the option of turning off the passenger airbag, plus with driver and passenger-side inflatable restraints.

There are three 12-volt outlets for things like radar detectors, cellular telephones and other devices. There are cup holders, a built in garage door opener and plenty of storage compartments. 

This truck has so many standard features the other manufactures charge extra for, like front and rear disc brakes with an anti-lock system, a remote keyless entry, power windows and more.

<b>The Engine</b>
The Silverado 3500 comes with the choice of three engines.

1.	The Vortec 6000 (6.0 Liter) V8 with 300 HP. (Standard)
2.	The Vortec 8100 (8.1 Liter) V8 with 340 HP. ($850 extra option)
3.	The Duramax 6600 turbo diesel V8 with 300 HP. ($4810 extra option)

Like I said this truck has the Duramax 6600 turbo diesel. When you first fire it up a little black smoke rolls out of the tail pipe and it starts almost instantly. Quiet is the word, this is a quiet smooth running diesel that can hardly be herd going down the road. Power it has, we were pulling the travel trailer and it is a little slow getting started (Compared to a Gas Engine) but it moves on down the road. Going down the interstate at 70 MPH was great, you could hardly tell it was pulling such a huge trailer. 

The diesel is produced in Moraine, Ohio in a joint venture between GM and Isuzu. GM claims it will out pull the Ford and Dodge diesels. This is a claim I will have to take their word on.

 <b>The Ride</b>
This truck has the Automatic, 5-Speed Allison with Overdrive transmission and does an excellent job shifting. They also offer an Automatic, 4-Speed with Overdrive and a 6-Speed Manual with Overdrive transmission.

The ride of the 4WD, extended cab, 8-foot bed 3500 Silverado LT is impressive, it is almost as good as any medium size car on the road. 

Without the trailer the truck handles great around curves and even though it is a long pickup, it is not noticeable. Parking it is another matter in the parking lots since they seem to be made for medium to small size cars.

While pulling the trailer, when you make a steep curve or pull up a steep hill, it is noticeable that you are pulling something. 

Braking was smooth even with the trailer behind us. (The truck did have trailer brakes installed.)

<b>All Around</b>
Cost for this beauty is $35,076.00 for the base price, $4,810.00 for the diesel, $1,200 for the 5 speed Automatic transmission and a destination charge to Kentucky was $720 for a total of $41,806. This is too rich for me!

The warranty covers you bumper to bumper for 3 years or 36,000 miles with 24-hour roadside assistance. It also has a 6 year or 100,000 mile sheet metal rust-thru warranty. 

If you are going to haul a lot or pull something big, then I highly recommend the 2001Chevrolet Silverado LT 3500, this beauty is solid as a rock!
