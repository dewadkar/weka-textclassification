            After checking Ford, Chevy, and Dodge, Toyota had the best value for my dollar. The 1999 Tacoma 4x2, 4 cyl, had more horsepower and torque than all of the previous models I checked. It also had a better warranty. I am also an auto technician and over the years I have been impressed with Toyota's reliability. 
I received the best price from Toyota and their salesman was very attentive to what my exact needs in a truck were. He should me exactly what I wanted in three different trucks.
The only thing I have been disappointed in has been the gas mileage. The sticker estimated 23 mpg city, 27 mpg highway. I have been around 21 mpg city. I haven't done much highway driving. I used to get better gas mileage with my 1985 GMC S15. Not by much though. <br><br>
