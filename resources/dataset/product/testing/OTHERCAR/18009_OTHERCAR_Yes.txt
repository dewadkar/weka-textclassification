            This vehicle was purchased in March of 98. It was a trade in, we previously owned the M30 which is discontinued. I believe it was replaced by the I30 or either the J30. Anyway our Q45 is called the black dragon in New Jersey. A lot of people like the Mercedes, Lexus and BMW, although these are good cars none can compare to the Q.

I like my fiancee love big cars. He owned a Lexus before and he loved it but I think he loves the Q better and won't admit it. What I love about the Q45 is that it drives like your are floating on air. The handle on this baby is real smooth. You can be driving thinking that you are doing 60 miles an hour and you'll be doing 80-85 scary but true. The stereo system is Bose. It is like sitting in front of an orchestra or something, or maybe being in the studio. You can hear every instrument when it is on. What I loved the most is that it comes with the cd player. 

We have a 1994 Q45 and it is in fair condition, never really had any problems with this car until after it was stolen. It was stolen 3 months after we had it. It was devastating because we both knew it would never be the same. In New Jersey we have the highest rate of stolen cars and auto insurance. They stole our car and took everything electronic out of it. Our black dragon was raped. The air conditioning system, cd's and the stereo system the panel to the doors. Anything you can think of they took it. It doesn't have that same feel anymore. And to top it of the insurance company had the nerve not to pay to get the same Bose system back in the car so now we have a Q45 with a sony radio. It's not the same sound at all. Looking forward to purchasing another one real soon. All luxury car owners purchase the Q. It is a true winner!!!! Promising satisfaction....
