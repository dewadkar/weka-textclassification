            The <i>Ferrari 360 Modena</i> is Ferrari's entry-level automobile. The <i>Ferrari 360 Modena</i> is an incredible car though. For fun, I decided to go to Lake Forest Sports Cars in Lake Forest, Illinois, and try one of these out. This is when I was shopping for a new sports car. I obviously wasn't going for a <i>Ferrari 360 Modena</i>, but I thought I'd be able to have the <b>TIME OF MY LIFE</b> in a Ferrari, so why not?! Here's what I found with the 2003 Ferrari 360 Modena.

<b>-It's Sexy Like A Bikini Model... Only Better!-</b>
*The <i>Ferrari 360 Modena</i> is an incredibly sexy car. From the first time I ever saw this thing back a few years ago, I fell in love with its look. It looks nicer than the Ferrari 348 Testarossa and nicer than the Ferrari F355 Berlinetta. The <i>Ferrari 360 Modena</i> has incredibly sleek curves. They grab the eyes, and don't let go of them. The <i>Ferrari 360 Modena</i> comes in different colors, my favorite is red. However, many other people choose yellow. I drove a red <i>Ferrari 360 Modena</i>, it was incredibly sexy. The <i>Ferrari 360 Modena</i> looks nicer than the Porsche 911 GT2 in my opinion, and that is the closest competition that the <i>Ferrari 360 Modena</i> receives from Porsche. But many people also do prefer the looks and styling of a Porsche, so choose what you like!

<b>-Hardcore Performance From A True Ferrari-</b>
*The <i>Ferrari 360 Modena</i> has amazing performance. The power comes from its 3.6L V-8 which pumps out 400HP at 8,500rpm. It also has 275ft/lb of torque at 4,750rpm. This gives the <i>Ferrari 360 Modena</i> great fast performance. It's mid-engine, it carries out the legacy of the previous Ferraris in the same class. However, it's faster than the 348 and 355 that came out before it. The <i>Ferrari 360 Modena</i> has a 6-Speed manual transmission. The <i>Ferrari 360 Modena</i> can make it from 0-60mph in around 4.3 seconds. That's fast! The <i>Ferrari 360 Modena</i> can give you the exhiliartion of a true Italian beauty, just as much as an Italian or other foreign sports car that costs more money! The <i>Ferrari 360 Modena</i> carries through the legacy of Ferrari, the <i>Ferrari 360 Modena</i> is built for pure performance!

<b>-Inside... Oh Baby!-</b>
*When you enter this beast, you feel like you're in one hell of a fast car! Being in the cockpit of a true sports car, like the <i>Ferrari 360 Modena</i> feels better than sex for some. Yes, I enjoyed the experience greatly. The interior is styled with a contemporary taste. It gives the <i>Ferrari 360 Modena</i> a very elegant feel, yet you still get extreme speed even in luxury! The interior feels the way a $140,000 interior should, it feels expensive, it looks nice, and it's sure to get some "wow" when people see it! When I was sitting in there, I felt comfortable. The interior of the <i>Ferrari 360 Modena</i> feels great.

<b>-This Baby Handles Like A Charm!-</b>
*When I turned the car on, I heard the sweet purr from it's V-8 behind me. It sounded so beautiful. I wanted to cry, seriously. I took off the parking brake, and let in the clutch. Then I put it into first, and started to roll out of the dealership. I really felt so much potential under my right foot. There was a total of four hundred horses under there. The salesman said he'd let me take it onto the highway (I-41). After pressing the gas harder, the car just took off. It was truly incredible. The clutch felt nice, and everything just seemed so perfect. The brakes were very strong and smooth on the <i>Ferrari 360 Modena</i>. Also, it cornered and handled nicely. If you want to drive this car daily, it would do the job. However, a Porsche 911 Carrera might be better for something like that. The car purred so beautifully, it was all like one beautiful fantasy. There's really nothing like driving a Ferrari!

<b>-Other Things You Should Consider-</b>
*The <i>Ferrari 360 Modena</i> isn't a cheap car. It's around $140,000. That's quite a bit of money to pay. It's somewhere around the same price range as the Porsche 911 GT2, but considerably more expensive cars like the Porsche 911 C4, Porsche 911 Turbo, and Porsche 911 Targa. If you want a car to drive everyday, the Porsche 911 is said to be a car that is best for the task. Also, a Ferrari is very expensive to maintain! However, if you truly have a loving passion for cars, then the <i>Ferrari 360 Modena</i> maybe the right car for you!

<b>-The Verdict-</b>
*The <i>Ferrari 360 Modena</i> is like a dream. To this day, it is my dream car. I never ended up buying it after I test drove it. It's too expensive to buy at this time considering I'm only in medical school, and have mortgage on a property. Instead, I traded my Pathfinder for a Nissan 350Z. The Nissan is a fraction of the price of the <i>Ferrari 360 Modena</i>! But maybe one day I'll have a Ferrari, or just a Porsche. If you want a car which driving it is like having sex, you should try out a Porsche 911 Carrera, but if you want to go a little further, you should try out Ferrari. Even though the <i>Ferrari 360 Modena</i> is Ferrari's entry-level car, it doesn't feel like a piece of junk! Sure it's not as fast as the 575 Maranello, but it's a lot cheaper and still feels like... Driving a Ferrari is just an indescribable experience! It's so beautiful...
