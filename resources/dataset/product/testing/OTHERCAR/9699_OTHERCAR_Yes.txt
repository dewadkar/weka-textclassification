            Leave it to the Japanese to come up with something that is as functional as it is visually appealing.  This car has brisk acceleration - you will find yourself passing others for sport; blazing xenon headlights - these things should be illegal they're so bright!; tiptronic shifting; a 225 HP engine; excellent sound insulation (and a Bose sound system that was custom-designed by Bose for this car) - I took my friends out on the open road where there weren't any close objects to judge speed and accelerated to 85 MPH and with the speedometer covered, I asked them how fast they thought we were going: nobody guessed higher than 60; deliciously supple leather - I had to train myself not to pet the seats;  and a sound system that is pure and crisp - I actually preferred listening to music in the car over listening on my home stereo system.  The bells and whistles don't stop there: the key fobs can be programmed to each user's specifications so that the seats and side mirrors will adjust to the presets when the doors are opened; the trunk is huge and you can pop down the backseat armrest to carry skis, boards and the like; the air conditioning is quiet and effective; the seats are infinitely adjustable (save the lumbar support - see below); the sunroof has many useful positions; the rear-view mirror automatically dims itself as needed at night.  As good as it is, I do have some issues: poor lumbar support in the seats - you'll notice this particularly on long trips; the seat leather rubs against the center console making an annoying squeaking noise; the suspension is cushy and comfortable for around town and long-distance cruising - however, you aren't going to buy this car unless you intend to take advantage of the powerful engine every now and then and for such times, the suspension is too cushy (I test drove the Type-S, which has a tighter suspension to go with the bigger, 265 HP, engine); there was a transmission defect in some of the 03's, which required me to turn in the car to have the tranny replaced; premium fuel isn't cheap; there is a delay when switching from park to drive before the car is ready to go - this is only a problem if you, like me, put the car into neutral or park when waiting at long traffic lights.
