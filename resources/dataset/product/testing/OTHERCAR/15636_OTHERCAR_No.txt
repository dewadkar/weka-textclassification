            This camera sucks. I paid $799 for a piece of junk. The quality of the photos even in 1024X768 fine mode is so poor that a $10.00 drug store camera is better. The LCD screen washes out in bright sunlight, so you can only use it indoors. The 2 hour battery lasts only 24 minutes, I timed it. Each diskette can only hold 11 pics in standard mode 640X480,
not the 64 that they advertise. Instead of 60 secs of video per diskette,
try 10 secs of very low quality video. The MPGs are terrible. I could not tell my friends apart. Don't try to email photos taken with this camera 
unless you do the following. Take the photo in 1024X768 fine mode, about 4 photos per disk. Run a blur on the JPG, then increase saturation and contrast. The colors are always washed out. Then reduce size 50%, and compress 70% the JPG. You can then send the photo. The JPGs produced by the FD 91 are full of jagged lines and artifacts. The blur tends to reduce this. Whatever you do - DO NOT - run sharpen as this will increase the artifacts in your picture and make it worthless. I spent hours Photo Impact trying to salvage the photos. Needless to say I returned the camera back to Comp USA. They charged me a 15% restocking fee. I gave them a long lecture on how the camera was a piece of junk. I left the store with my $800. Hopefully I can save you the headache.<br><br>
