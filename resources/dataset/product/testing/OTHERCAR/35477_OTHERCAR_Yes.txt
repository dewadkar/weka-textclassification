            I have been agonizing about getting a new digital camera for a while now. My previous camera was a Sony Cybershot DSC-S50 (2 Megapixels) and I still love the swiveling screen and nice pictures (see my previous review). Being addicted to Sony products biased me toward this camera but I also like Nikon equipment. After a lot of research, and a 12-month same as cash deal at Best Buy, I settled on the F707. This camera is definitely on the �high end� but I have already got an 8x10 print made that looks fabulous.
Pluses:
The lens is very fast and the 5x optical zoom is unheard of in this price range.
The pictures are amazing! Go to some of the web forums and view some people�s work.
The hologram auto focus does a good job of focusing in difficult situations.
The body is made of a magnesium alloy that just feels very sturdy, the Sony model one step down has a plasticy feel to it.
The camera is easy to use, Sony has thought out many of the control placement.
The rapid 3 shot mode can help grab a fast moving event.
The bracketing feature can help get a well-exposed shot in difficult situations.

Minuses:
Camera comes with a 16M Memory stick. Ha! That only fits 8 full resolution JPG�s. Luckily the Memory Stick prices have dropped. I got a 128 for $90, and I have since found some on the web for $60.
128M is the largest Memory Stick available now, perhaps Sony will add 256 later.
Memory Stick is still not a mainstream storage device. I don�t mind since I have a lot of Sony stuff. I just wish they would compromise on such a high-end camera, perhaps an additional compact flash slot? (The IBM Microdrives are not all that great, I spoke with a professional photographer and he doesn�t use them. He said that the risk of a crash is too great.)
Camera is kind of oddly shaped. I am getting used to it now, but I still like the traditional feel of my DSC-S50.
The zoom control seems to be backwards to what is intuitive.
I don�t like the �double� TTL flash. Although this provides better metering, the initial flash tends to get people to begin to blink and then the actual picture is of a bunch of �droopy eyed� folks. I have heard that the Sony external flash doesn�t do this.

Overall I love this camera, but I don�t think it is for everyone. Walking around on vacation with a $1,000 hunk of technology can be intimidating. I am still nervous about dropping it. I would classify this as an advanced consumer/ semipro camera. The next step up is a digital SLR (which start about $2000 with no/limited lens), so I think this baby is the king of the hill for the next 5 minutes.
