            The 1994 Oldsmobile Custlas Sierra is a fantastic low priced car. In addition to being a low priced car they are comfortable and roomy, and nearly the maintenance free car for years to come. My brother and my mother both own the Oldsmobile Cutlas Sierra and they have been extremely fantastic long lasting vehicles.   They are great to drive, they handle well, and get great gas mileage. I love the car, and wish I would have purchased one in the first place. I recently took a trip to California and I took my brothers car, it was fantastic. It was a quiet comfortable ride, and it got fantastic gas mileage. In addition to these it was great because my 'rear' was not hurting from sitting the 12 hour drive down to California. I had no problems for the duration of my trip and the car worked mechanically clean.   This car features cruise control, automatic door locks, and power windows and seats (depending on model and year). It's an extremely reliable powerful car that can pick you up and take you anywhere. They feature a V6 engine from GM one of the worlds leading motor vehicle companies, with a name like GM under the hood you must know it's reliable.   The car is not a over sized car on the outside, it's quite compact but roomy even inside. If your looking for an every day road car, or a pick up and travel car, the Oldsmobile Custlas Sierra is waiting for you. Let me know what YOU think.<br><br>
