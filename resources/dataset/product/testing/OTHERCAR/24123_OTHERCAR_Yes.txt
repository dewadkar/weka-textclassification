            <i>First seen at the Denver Auto Show in 1991, I was determined to own this car - no matter the cost. 7 years later, successful in my dream, I was not disappointed.</i>

In 1998, I purchased a 1994 3000GT SL. Fog lights, leather seats, and over 200 horses are standard equipment for this model. Optional items include a sunroof and an automatic transmission.

<b>Grand Touring</b>
For those wondering, the "GT" stands for Grand Touring, and there is truth in that acronym. My car has seen the Atlantic in Florida, the Pacific in Vancouver. Its been south to Texas and north to British Columbia. There is nothing like driving through the curves of the Canadian Rockies in a 3000GT. But every mile has been a thrill. The SL model is modest in power, providing enough to pull away from the crowd, but lacking enough that the Corvette owner pulling away ahead feels a little superior. The difference in Automatic and Standard transmission is great. The automatic is much more sluggish than its counterpart.

<b>Interior</b>
The interior of a 3000GT, or Dodge Stealth for that matter, is more of a cockpit. The console wraps around the driver on the right. On the left, the door has a comfortable arm shelf and hand grip. Unlike many "sports" cars, the circles in the middle of the dash are actually working gauges. The driver sits low and with generous leg room. The driver's seat has power lumbar and side bolster controls to completely lock the driver into place.

With the seats folded down, there is enough trunk space (something you won't find in many other cars in this class) to fit two full-sized suitcases.

<b>Exterior</b>
With the exception of the side air scoops, each hump or scoop is fully functional. The back window has a windshield wiper... I know, a cheap feature, but one that is lacking on many higher priced cars. The rear spoiler does not compromise rear-vision although I hear it does on newer models. The headlights are the brightest on any vehicle I've ever driven. Tires/Rims are 16" although some SL models will have the larger chrome 17".

<b>Features</b>
One criticism the 3000 has pulled from other sports-cars enthusiasts, is that it is a techie car, not a full-out muscle car. This is true. The engine is highly dependent on various computer modules. In fact, my idle, shifting, and cruise problems were all attributed to a minor computer configuration that was not reset properly when I had the car tuned-up. The driver has the option of Power or Economy transmission modes. There is also a Touring and Sport mode for the suspension - the latter providing a tighter hold for tight curves.

<b>Problem-Free</b>
With 80,000 miles, the car has been flawless and completely trouble-free (minus the small light under the hood). At 64,000 miles I did have the "60K service" completed, a pricey 4-digit tune-up that includes replacing belts, plugs, water pump, etc. Other than regular oil changes, the car has never seen service. I hear the VR-4 (twin-turbo) has much more trouble than the base or SL models.

<b>Still turning heads...</b>
The first time I drove the car and pulled off the interstate, a group of kids on the side of the road yelled, "HOLY CRAP!" as I drove by. Even with the car turning 8 this coming year, I still get that kind of response - comments at the drive-thru, compliments in the parking lot, looks on the street, and of course, the occasional Honda Civic high-school driver that pulls up for a challenge. 

Perhaps one of the best things about the car is that they are not in every parking lot, they aren't at every street light, they are rare.
