            My main reason for buying this car was its looks.  I'm always struck by its beauty when I look at it.  The styling is SO much better than the plastic jellybeans people are buying these days.  Driving it is wonderful and I love looking down the long hood and seeing the Lincoln star sitting majestically atop the grille.  It's a very graceful and dignified car.

The interior is incredibly roomy, and is perfect for long trips.  One feels very safe in this car despite its lack of airbags, which I don't quite trust anyway.  I'm perfectly happy knowing I can crush a Metro like a soda can.  The ride is smooth and the seats are comfy, as one would expect in a luxury car, and it handles a great deal better than its detractors would have you believe.  

As far as reliability is concerned, it's an absolute dream.  Shortly after I bought it, some sort of little sensor in the engine went bad and had to be replaced, but I've had to do no repairs since then.  It always starts right up.  

My opinion is that 1984 was the best year for the Town Car in the 80s.  I prefer the upright taillights and more angular parking lights to the rounded ones on the 1985-89 models, and the woodgrained inserts on the door panels of the 1980-84 Town Cars are far more attractive than the vinyl/fabric inserts on the later ones.  Overall, a truly fine car.
