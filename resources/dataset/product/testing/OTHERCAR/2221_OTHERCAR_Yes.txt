            I am a full size truck owner and have been for years. In fact, I still own a suburban for hauling all the kids around. But the wife and I needed a second vehicle that was tough, easy to own and safe in an accident. After much research we found the Suzuki Vitara. As soon as you see it you will notice that it's different. But once you drive it, you know it's a class act. It is nimble and easy to drive. Off-road it is quick around objects with a short turning span. It's not the brute my full size trucks have been, but it gets there just as quick. 

The fun really begins when you go out on the town and open the sun-roof. This takes 10 seconds and off you go with the wind in your hair. However, a soft top is noisy in traffic and a black top is hot in Arizona. 

The gas mileage is 23 around town and I don't have a light foot.

These little gems are hard to find and if you want color and options it gets harder. If you want one and see it, grab it or some else will tomorrow. <br><br>
