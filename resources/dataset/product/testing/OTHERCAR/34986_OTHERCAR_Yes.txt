            I recently rented a 1999 Buick Century. I drove approx. 800 miles. The gas mileage was great, even at high speeds. The tank holds 17.5 gallons which gets about 500 miles. The interior is spacious for 4 people and the ride is very smooth. Outside noise is minimal. The seats are comfortable, even for long trips. However, next trip I'll take a pillow. Without a pillow it is difficult to sleep due to the shoulder strap.I rented the car for 5 days. While on vacation on the fourth day I hit a deer on a highway at 55mph. The animal came out of nowhere. It was dark and I had no reaction time at all. Needless to say the car protected me very well. The windshield was smashed on the far left lower corner,hood dented, front fender and grill damaged as well. I called the rental company and got another Buick Century. This one had 23K miles and I could not have told the difference from the first Century w/ 8K miles.The trip home went well, again the ride smooth and easy using cruise control. I am an aircraft technician and appreciate well designed and built cars. I own a 1987 Buick LeSabre which is running just fine. I plan to buy my wife the 2000 Buick Century. Under the hood is a well designed layout for ease of maintenance. The trunk is also spacious which comes in handy for a family of 4 on holiday. I really like this car. Price is reasonable as well.( I checked )
