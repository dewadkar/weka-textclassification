            Well, we picked up the Mazda MPV back in to July 2001. Our options included side air bags and 6-Disc CD changer. 

The milage right now of our Mazda is about 12,200 miles.

It is not daily driven however.

The van is a pretty decent van. It's engine performance could be slightly improved as it was for 2002. Entering the highway requires pushing the engine as the power of it OKAY at best. However once your in the highway it is good. Passing power is decent not the best but good.

The gas milage especially using it around the city of New York is rather poor. We average about 130 miles before it is required to put gas again.

The interior room is pretty room and overall feels comfortable all around. The second room may not have as much room as the bigger minivans but overall it's comfortable.

I've been in a Lincoln Navigator(old model) and the third row of the Mazda MPV feels so much comfortable. Three adults can fit just fine.

Cargo room is excellent especially with the easily to fold to the floor third row seat. However I would request that Mazda copies Toyota with the split third row. That would be a nice feature.

The cargo room is almost equal to that of a Toyota Sequoia.
