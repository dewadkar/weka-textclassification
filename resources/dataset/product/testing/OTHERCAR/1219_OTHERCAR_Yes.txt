            Not too long ago I purchased a 91 Mr2 NA (naturally aspired or not a turbo), after a small accident it was totaled (I was not at fault).  I quickly replaced it with another mr2.  My replacement mr2 is a 93NA.  There are a few small differences in suspension, and the 93 has a touch more power.  However, I will mostly talk about mr2's as I have experienced them.

     The Toyota mr2 is a mid-engine car, rear wheel drive, and is a two seater, hence the name Mr2.  It is not for the timid driver who is not experienced in a rear wheel drive vehicle and a mid engine vehicle.  This can be one of the cons of the car, however it is also a plus.  The car can be very prone to oversteer.  Oversteer is a type of skid where the back tires break loose, while the front tires still hold.  If properly controlled it can be a very effective way to increase cornering exit speed.  But if not properly done, it will be more then easy to spin the car.  If you are aware of what the car is doing, and how to control it, this is very appealing in a vehicle if you like to push the envelope, like me.  I simply cannot say enough about how this car handles.  There is nothing like the feeling you get from sliding the car through a corner.

     In my humble opinion the mr2 is one of the sharpest looking cars out there. I find myself walkig out in the garage everynow and then going wow thats a nice car, i can't belive it's mine.  It gets looks all over town, and I get people asking questions about it at least once a week because it is a rare car. 
     Passenger and storage room in the mr2 leaves a little to be desired, but what true sports car doesn't.  Since it's a two seater, you can only bring one passenger.  There are two small trunks, one up front with a bit of room, but the shape of the trunk prevents you from storing anything of a good size.  The second trunk is behind the engine, which is reasonable; it's about 18 inches wide by 18 inches tall, and the width of the car.  There is a little bit of useable room behind the seats, but nothing to brag about especially if you are tall and sit with the seat all the way back.  I find that headroom is not so bad, but I am not the tallest.

    Reliability is a one of the strong points of the mr2.  Toyota over built this car.  Everything on it is sturdy and well made.  I have not had one single mechanical problem with either my 91 or my 93.  Friends i have in the mr2 club have said the same thing.  Both of my mr2's have had a little bit of valve seal leak.  This causes a small puff of smoke when you start the car, and it usually means you have to add a quart of oil between changes, but causes no significant problems and is fairly common in many other cars as well.  Mr2 Turbos can have problems with the turbo units, but all turbo units are plagued with this if they are not maintained correctly. Turbos also require more maintenance, and more frequent oil changes. Not any different then a Mazda or a Nissan turbo.  

     Safety in mr2's is great as well.  While they can be a bit to handle by the inexperienced driver, if a wreck ever does occur the driver and passenger can walk away with relatively no injuries, or comparable injuries to other vehicles.  I know this from experience.  As I said earlier I was in an accident in my 91 mr2, when a elderly lady pulled out right in front of me.  I hit her Buick at about 40 mph, and the only injury I received was a dislocated thumb.  This was caused by the airbags deploying while I was honking the horn.  I have also known other mr2 drivers through the mr2 club who had been in accidents and not been seriously hurt.

     Economy in a mr2 is up for debate.  While it does not get the best gas mileage out there, it is fairly cheap compared to other sports cars, and gets as good or better gas mileage for cars in its class.  It has a lower sticker price then most sports cars also.  I picked my 91 with 97 thousand miles on it for 6 thousand dollars.  And I got my 93 with 60 thousand miles for $7,500.  It is small, and can be parked in virtually every parking spot.  

I would recomend this car to the sports car lover, who wants to have fun, knows how to control a vehicle.  This car is stylish, fun, powerful, well balanced, and corners like nothing else.  It doesn't get the best milage, or have the most room but name me a true sports car that does, and it also can be too much for the timid unexperianced driver.<br><br>
