            I buried my  '94 Jeep last year, after she died an early death at 100,000 miles on the DC Beltway!

I thought I would eventually buy another Jeep, as I really enjoyed that car...( at least in the beginning....see my review on her in Epinions...)

BUT....the Nissan X-terra ( SE V6 automatic) changed my mind for good. After test driving  two different X-terra's for about 50 miles each, I realized that I could get the comfort and speed I was used to in the Jeep for about $12,000 less! Not to mention that the gas mileage doubles in the X-terra (@19-20 mpg to Jeep's sad 11-12 mpg).

I also like the way the X-terra handles off-road much better than the Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo. The X-terra's 4-wheel drive kicks in effortlessly and tames the rough, New Mexico terrain. It feels like gliding over  velvet. I barely noticed speed-bumps and sandy ditches, all of which I purposely drove through to test the mettle of this car.  The speed and pick-up to 60 mph is great, even with the air conditioing on full-blast.This is a pleasantly "cushy" ride for a no-fuss 4-wheel drive truck!

My biggest surprise about the X-terra is that the interior seating and spatial arrangements are excellent. I am nearly 6 feet tall and I felt very comfortable as a passenger in the back seat area, and as the driver, too. The rear seating is elevated a bit so that you can see very well from the back seat. The seats are also very  easy to remove, creating a perfect space for big loads.

I admit that I miss the ability to adjust the driver's seat  electronically--a Jeep feature--and I also wish the X-terra steering wheel was a bit more flexible in re-positioning, but overall, these are small issues when viewed against the very positive big-picture of the X-terra's benefits.

I have selected a Khaki-colored X-terra for purchase next week. More on this neat  suv later!
