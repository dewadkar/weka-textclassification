            I purchased this camera about a month ago, because I was sick of buying expensive film and ending up with pictures that didnt come out right or not at all.  The Sony DSC-P50 is the answer for the amateur photographer who wants an easy to use camera, that simply takes great pictures.

The camera itself is very easy to use.  Personally, I just skipped the manual, and just went out driving taking pictures of interesting scenery and experimenting with all of the different features.  

One of the coolest features being the filter.  On this camera you can choose between: Black and White, Sephia, or Solarize, all of which give you different options in trying to capture certain effects. 

Another awesome feature of this camera is the incredible 6X zoom.  I went to a baseball game recently and even though my seats were far away, the zoom feature made my pictures look like I was very close to the field!  

The software is also a big plus of this camera.  Downloading is a cinch.  Just plug in the USB cable, follow a few simple instructions and your pictures are right there for your keeping, or to print out on photo quality paper.

Other great features: Automatic shut-off (if you accidentally leave the camera on, large LED preview/playback screen, movie mode, 

The only big downfall of this camera for me were the very pricey add-ons that are basically MUST HAVES:

1. A larger memory stick.  The camera comes with a 4mb stick, which will only get you about 25 pics or so set on the lowest setting.  With the 64mb stick that I purchased, I can easily take 200+ pictures with ease.

PRICE: $49.99

2. An internal battery and recharger.  This camera will drain the life out of standard AA batteries in about 15 minutes.  I even tired more expensive batteries which basically gave me about 15 more minutes.  Reluctantly, I bought the battery and recharger, which last for about 3 hours now.... 

BATTERY PRICE: $49.50

A/C ADAPTER PRICE: $34.50

Total for NECESSARY accessories: $133.99

Even though the accessories totaled up quickly in price, I still love my camera for all of the cool and easy to use features it has, and will always trust the Sony name.  I noticed that they have dropped in price recently, which make this camera a true bargain for amateur digital photographers like myself.
