            I live in Montana and was a Heavy Equipment Mechanic so I traveled constantly.  This truck was great for driving long distances and the gas mileage is great because of the lighter engine but it wouldn't haul a trailer.  

I absolutely LOVED the truck until winter came!  Even in rain the tires would slide.
  
I had a fairly heavy tool box in the back of the truck and  on a incline that had a little ice on it the engine could not pull the hill with the weight of the toolbox in the back.  I had to be pushed up to find some better traction.  I was the only vehicle who couldn't pull the hill.  I had winter tires also.  

The truck was so light weight that when I had a custom stereo put in the installer commented on what a nice truck it was and patted the hood and the entire truck bounced.  I'm not sure if that's a good or a bad thing.   

Another time I was on my way to work and traffic was backed up because the road was really icy.  I was maybe going 5 miles and hour, my truck was spinning all over the road and ended up in brodies.  I had to drive on the side of the road in the newer snow to get to work.  I couldn't believe mine was the only vehicle acting this way!

It did have some get up and go!  Of course it didn't pass as well in Overdrive so I'd have to gear down to 4th.  This truck would be ideal for a warmer climate!  I got a great deal on it and never had any other problems with it.  

I put miles on it like crazy and it held it's value.  In fact, it was worth more blue book when I sold it than what I bought it for!  <br><br>
