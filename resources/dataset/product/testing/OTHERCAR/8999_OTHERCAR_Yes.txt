            Dueto pressure from my Wife, I've decided to start looking for a new vehicle. Currently, I've got a 1998 Ford Escort ZX2 that I just love. It's small, it's fast and I can fly around corners like a bat out of hell. I often have a big time putting that little gem on the road and seeing how fast I can get into fifth gear. The car has been very reliable and, as it is in essence a go-kart for adults, it's a lot of fun.

Unfortunately, my Wife and I have a three-year-old Son and we are expecting a baby daughter in December. My Wife has pointed out that the ZX2 is getting a bit small for our needs, so I've decided to purchase something else rather than argue with a cranky, pregnant woman. Now, my Wife has a 2000 Saturn that works out just fine, but I'd rather have something else.

So, I've been looking at smaller SUV's, and I've noticed a lot of these Kia Sportages roaming around town. I've also read a lot of mixed reviews about these things, so I thought I'd borrow one for a couple of days, test drive it, and report what I discovered. I tried out a 2000 Sportage EX in a really tasty forest green color (they call it evergreen), and here's what I found:

<b>The good</b>

This vehicle looks pretty sharp. I'm not one to care much about looks of a vehicle, but I'd hang my head in shame if I were caught driving a mini van. While I want a &quot;family&quot; vehicle, I don't want to be caught behind the wheel of the 90's version (2000 version?) of a station wagon. While mini vans may, for the most part, lack those wood grain panels on the horrible, horrible station wagons that were once popular, I still hate the things. The Kia, while small, has enough room to haul a family, take the dog to the vet and carry groceries, but I didn't feel like a total square while driving it. No offense to mini van drivers, but I've hated those things ever since they first became popular -- I don't know if they can go faster than 30 MPH, but they seem to clog up traffic pretty effectively as they poke leisurely around the streets in my neck of the woods.

I also found the five-speed manual transmission to be very smooth. Although I did have trouble convincing the folks at the Kia lot that I didn't want an automatic, I was able to drive off the lot with a standard. I found that the clutch is light and finding the point where it engages is relatively easy -- so easy, in fact, that I didn't kill the car while trying to get in first or reverse once in the two days I had the Kia. The standard &quot;locks&quot; in gear very securely and I could positively feel when the car was in gear. Also, shifting felt smooth rather than notchy.

The engine in the Kia is a 130-horse, in-line four cylinder with dual, overhead cams. Although I've heard some folks gripe about the Kia's lack of power, it seemed fine to me and I was able to get it up to speed in no time. Of course, I don't know how one equipped with an automatic transmission behaves, but the standard I drove worked out fine. The engine and transmission work well together, and I was able to &quot;feel&quot; when the vehicle needed to be shifted rather than look at the tach or speedometer to figure out when it was time to change gears. The engine is relatively quiet, and packs a solid, steady power curve with no extreme &quot;jerks&quot; or &quot;lags&quot; in torque.

The Kia I test drove came equipped with power locks and windows, and all of that worked fine. It also had a six-speaker CD player, and that sounded fine, also. The bass response in that system was sufficient, but nothing all that thrilling. It worked fine for me, but I'm 31-years-old and my &quot;music-blaring&quot; days have almost come to an end.

The front, bucket seats are comfortable, but the back, bench seat is a bit hard. I think the kids will be fine back there if I buy this thing, so that's no big deal. The interior, for the most part, isn't what one would consider &quot;plush.&quot; It's more utilitarian than anything, and everything was cozy enough for me. The analog gauges are all easy to read, and the controls for the stereo, air-conditioner, power windows and etc. are all within reach. The air condition, by the way, cooled well and didn't suck down the vehicle's power too much. Air conditioning, here in Arkansas, is crucial.

As for the four-wheel-drive system, I didn't test it out too much. Sure, I engaged the thing a time or two, and can report that popping it in and out of four-wheel-drive is easy enough. My off-roading, though, involved driving part way across a relatively flat field, so I didn't exactly test the system to its limits. From what I could tell, though, it seemed sure-footed enough, but I'd need a good snow storm to find out for sure.

The warranty on this vehicle is pretty good -- Kia offers a standard, three years of 36,000 miles, bumper-to-bumper warranty. That can be extended, for a fee, of course, to seven years, 84,000 miles. From what some have said about the reliability of this vehicle, a good warranty on this car may be crucial.

The price for this was also right. Try around $17,000 after rebates and incentives for a fully-loaded, top of the line little vehicle that looks nifty. That's not bad, provided the thing is reliable (the verdicts still out on that point, I'm afraid).

Finally, I really like the Kia lot here in town. The nice lady who showed me the Kia didn't pressure me, and seemed to know quite a bit about the vehicle. In my quest for a sports utility vehicle, I've run across some real jerks. The worst was at a Honda lot where I looked at a Passport. I won't go into that story, but I wound up cursing quite a bit and storming off the lot after the fellow tried to pressure me into a bunch of junk I didn't want (including an automatic transmission -- what's the deal with car salesmen and automatics?)

<b>The bad</b>

Well, let's start with the Kia's handling. It feels great while driving in a straight line, but cornering made me nervous as a long-tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs. The top-heavy body on that thing just rolls while the thing is going around corners, and I couldn't help but imagine tumping the thing over on its side and flying down the street in a sparking, scraping death trap. I wouldn't want to throw that thing at a corner too hard. Hell, I wouldn't even want to jerk the steering wheel too hard at high speeds. I know I'm used to my little Ford, but I didn't feel too safe in the Kia while cornering.

Then, there's the wind noise. While cruising at about 75 or 80, the wind noise in that car is durn loud. So loud, in fact, that speaking in a normal voice to passengers is a bit difficult. I'm not sure why the cabin of that vehicle is so loud, but it's distracting.

While I enjoyed the manual transmission, getting the thing into fifth gear just felt, well, wrong. Fifth gear was a long reach for me, and I'm six-feet tall. I felt, in fact, like I had to lean over quite a bit to get the car in fifth, and that's not a good feeling. I missed a time or two, in fact, and wound up in third gear by mistake. That's not a good sign.

Finally, I saw <i>three</i> Sportages in the service shop of the Kia dealership when I returned my test model to the lot. I hung around long enough to talk to a service guy and asked whether there were a lot of problems with Sportages. He said the problems are, on the whole, minor and the most common one involves the &quot;check engine&quot; light that comes on easily when the gas cap isn't fully sealed on the vehicle. That may be correct, or he may be covering up something (that's right, I don't trust <i>anyone</i> these days -- being a total cynic and expecting the worst just means I'm rarely disappointed when miserable events, such as eight years of the Clinton presidency, annoy me).

<b>Conclusions?</b>

So, what did I decide about this vehicle after a test drive? I'm still not sure. I enjoyed the vehicle and like the way it looks and drives, but the body roll, wind noise and questions about the vehicle's reliability nag at me. Sure, I could buy one that's more expensive and have some more piece of mind, but this Kia is rather like that mutt puppy I brought home as a kid -- his pedigree was in question, but his eccentricities and charming personality made him a winner. Whether that's truly the case with the Kia is something I'll have to study on for a while.<br><br>
