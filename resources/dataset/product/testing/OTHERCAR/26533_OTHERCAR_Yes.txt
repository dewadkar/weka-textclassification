            The S-10 Chevrolet I bought is pretty.  My daughter uses it to commute to school.  We've not had any problems with it.  I love putting the groceries on the back, it is so convenient.  I would hate to see scratches on this truck, so I am very careful when putting items on the back.  It has a bed-liner, which helps keep some scratches off! The paint on this truck is a cherry metalic color with black bumpers and trim.     

The V-6 engine, power steering, and great sporty looks, makes it a joy to drive (even for girls).  Three passengers fit nicely.

I think anyone would enjoy driving an S-10 Pick-Up.  Not only could it be
a useful working tool, but also a nice convenient, small family, vehicle.
