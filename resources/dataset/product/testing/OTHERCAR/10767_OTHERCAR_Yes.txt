            I have never had the experience of owning a Cadillac and was a little apprehensive of the aluminum engines from the reputation of the 4.1. But the 4.9 has been a dream! With excellent highway merging power, good to excellent fuel economy (try 28 mpg at 80 in California, loaded with people and luggage) and very low maintenance costs. This is the first year of the electronic 4 speed transmission and you would be hard pressed to even feel this thing shift! The only complaints I have are the electronic ride control which is showing a fault but still corrects the cars ride height and handling characteristics and an intermittent glitch in the digital dash when the outside temperature is above 80 degrees. The car now has 145,000 miles on the original motor and transmission and I feel with the great care that has been gave to it, this classy ride should go well into the 200K+ range

If anyone wants a great ride with room for up to six full size adults with ample performance, economy and reliability I completely recommend this car. I truly love this ride and it proved to me that Cadillac came back in a big way!<br><br>
