            I bought a Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited three weeks ago. It is the third Jeep I have owned. I've owned a Grand Cherokee, a Jeep Wrangler, and now a Cherokee Limited. This one is a winner. It easily shifts from 2WD to 4WD, has lots of power and this one has the Chrylser Infiniti Stereo with a CD Player. Great stereo sound. The front seats are a little tight. If you are over 6'1" test drive one for awhile before you decide. I am 6'1" and on the highway on long drives the cruise control makes the front seat tightness OK. The mileage has been good, about 19.5 mpg on the highway, and that is on a brand new engine. If you are thinking of the Grand Cherokee with the 4.0 liter inline six you might want to consider the Cherokee Limited instead. It is a tad smaller on the inside, but it is a lot lighter than the Grand Cherokee so you get a peppier ride. It is also $6,000 cheaper. In summary, this is a good buy for a 4WD SUV that is pretty reasonably priced.
