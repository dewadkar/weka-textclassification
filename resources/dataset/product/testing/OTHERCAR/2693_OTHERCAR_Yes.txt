             One month today I leased my 2000 AWD Mountaineer. Love at first sight.... I found the the Mountaineer to be beautiful inside and out. Total luxury!The test drive bought me. However, the next day would bring a storm that would last well over a week. Wind and &quot;lots&quot; of rain.... The true test.Perhaps &quot;my&quot; AWD is lacking something all the others are not. At 30mph I felt as if at anytime I would be blown off the highway. I &quot;Did Not&quot; feel as if I had total control as I did when I owned a car. In the same type of weather on the parkway at 55mph I felt a lot of swaying which gives one the feeling of sliding even when you are not. That I Did Not like. The worst feeling. I must say though, It is my &quot;best friend&quot; in beautiful weather, and my worst enemy in bad. I will not drive it. I'm afraid to see it with the snow come winter. I know one thing, It will have a nice rest. Now no matter what the weather,  I will not go over 60. Any suggestions? <br><br>
