            Our daughter's first Christmas was the day that we decided we needed a minivan. Trying to carry all of the necessary equipment that is needed for a two-month old, plus Christmas on a 5 hour drive to see family made us realize that we were definitely parents. Unfortunately it was a year later before we purchased our Dodge Caravan. Now we wonder how we ever traveled in anything else. It is as comfortable and easy to handle as our sedan. The price was incredible for our now most invaluable tool of transportation. Anyone looking for a pleasurable ride combined with the comfort and convenience of a larger vehicle will be pleased with the Dodge Caravan.<br><br>
