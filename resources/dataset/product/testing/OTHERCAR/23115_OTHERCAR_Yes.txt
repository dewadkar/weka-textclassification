            I originally bought the car because my dad is a dodge man and I knew he would be dissapointed (and not helpful) if I bought anything else.  Over the last year I have grown to love this car more than any other car I have ever driven.  The ride is superb, the controls are placed right where they need to be and the looks are the best.  The car was created for families, but I reccomend this car to anyone that wants a reliable and stylish car at a very reasonable price.  I have had the car since the end of 98 with 17,000 miles on it, and haven't been back to the dealer since.  I have taken trips to Ohio, and California with no problems.  This car is the best midsized vehicle on the market.<br><br>
