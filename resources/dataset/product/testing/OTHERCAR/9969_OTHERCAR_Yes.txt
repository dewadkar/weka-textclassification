            Prior to buying this car, I had a 1991 Miata and enjoyed it quite a bit.  It handled great, but was lacking in power and the soft-top was a bit too noisy for me. 

I really wanted the SLK, but the 1998 only came in AT, so I was forced to buy an automatic for the first time in 15 years.  I was somewhat disappointed with the shift points and overall feeling of power.  I traded it for the first 1999 5-speed that I could get.  At the time, SLKs were still getting a premium over list price so I managed to sell my 1998 for about the same as the cost of the 1999.

The 5-speed is a MUCH better translation of the power to acceleration.  It may not quite as good a shifter as the Boxster, but it's better than everything else I've tried.  One of the critiques of the MT SLK has been that the 0-60 times are not as good as one would hope for.  This may be true, but at least part of this is due to the choice of shift points.  The 1999 MT SLK redlines at 58.5MPH in 2nd gear and because of a rev limiter, you have to shift into 3rd to get to 60.  

I took it to a race track (Thunderhill, N. of Sacramento) and had a great first time on a track meant for Indy racing/training.  It performed incredibly well and I was able to keep up with an RX-7 that had much more power (255HP vs. 185HP) and was lighter 2300lb vs. 3000lb).

The SLK is by far the smoothest, quietest 2-seat convertible I have ever been in.  With the top up, it is better than any sedan I have owned and with it down, it is a beautifully clean-lined convertible.  The roof has been reliable and there have never been any sign of leaks.  I'm 6'4&quot; and while I barely fit into the Miata, the SLK has a seat position that gives me ~2&quot; of clearance.

A minor complaint is that the 1999 amplifier only allows for a proprietary digital optical connector to the CD changer in the trunk.  This means that you MUST buy the Mercedes option ($1000 after the sale).  This was not true in 1998.
