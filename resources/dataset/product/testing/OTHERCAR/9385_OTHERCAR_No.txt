            Jetta's seem to be the new trendy car for twenty and thirty something's, and after hearing good things about them, I decided to give one a try.  They are sport and cute, and very maneuverable.  They are very roomy for something that is not really considered a compact car.  But the pro's end there!!!  Maybe I just had bad luck, but mine turned out to be a lemon!!! My air conditioner broke 3 times in the dead heat of summer!!!  They finally figured out there was a defective part.  Apparently where I live there is a shortage of VW mechanics, so it always took at least 2 weeks to make an appointment with the local dealership.  

Also, the cup holders are HORRIBLE!!! I know this seems like a minor detail, but sometimes it can be important!!  The cup holders are located below the radio, and a drink from a fast food restaurant won't fit because it runs into the ash tray.  BAD DESIGNING!!

My RPM's seemed to rev unusually high on even the smallest of hills.  I thought I was just being paranoid, but others also commented on it.  Since I only had a 24,000 mile warranty, I traded the car in when it had 20,000 miles.  I was too afraid I would be shelling out money left and right after the warranty ran out.

The car is definitely cute.  I miss the way I used to zip around in it.  However, it just turned out to be a lemon!<br><br>
