            We bought this truck for use as a d/d and a weekend workhorse. We haul a 9.5' fully self contained cab over camper we also pull a 16ft car hauler trailer with a CJ-7 jeep on top.The trailer also has a &quot;LARGE&quot; tool box loaded with all kinds of EXTRA jeep gear!!! The truck has always performed very well, fuel mpg has been 13 to 16 loaded, as a d/d it gives me 18 to 22 mpg. All of these figures can be proven.I have tracked every tank of fuel that has went through this truck since new. We only had two small situations with the truck, one was the temp sending unit the other was small oil leak on rear seal of engine.All covered by warranty. I should say that it is a CTD and a 5 speed trans. The truck is loaded with all the TOYS we could get for it from the factory in '96. My only minor grip is I wish it was a &quot;Quad Cab.&quot; That will change when the &quot;New one's&quot; come out. As you can see we are really happy with Truck, also please feel free to contact us about &quot;Turbo Diesel Registry&quot;, the best of the best of all the magazines for &quot;Dodge Truck&quot;   Best to all  Perry &amp; Linda <br><br>
