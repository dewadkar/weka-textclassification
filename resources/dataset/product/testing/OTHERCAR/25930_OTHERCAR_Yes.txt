            I love this car.  I own the 2 door SE (fully loaded with all the extra options) and it is awesome.  We just welcomed our first child and I can tell you I feel really good about this car and feel he is more than safe in the back seat.  It looks sporty and fun on the outside, but it has a nice smooth ride and even the back seat is comfy to ride in.  I have the V6 engine and I am thrilled with the power that it has, I just love the get up and go I have with this car. This was definately one of the best decisions I have ever made about a car and I can assure you that when my lease has expired I will either buy this car or get a new one  :o)<br><br>
