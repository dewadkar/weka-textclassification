            The Sony F505V Cybershot is a megapixel camera that delivers great digital photos. It's too bad the camera costs mega bucks. Digital cameras are dropping in price all the time now so it is difficult to justify buying the 505 or the 505V unless it's on a mega-sale. If you are lucky enough to get this camera as a gift (or if price is of little import), this camera will certainly satisfy your every desire.

First and foremost is the look. This camera looks great and people will tell you that. When it comes to electronics, Sony knows style! Every dollar you spend on this camera will feel worth it when folks walk over to you just to see what is this shiny, silver, thing you are holding in your hand. Thankfully, the 505V is not just about looks. To this camera, appearances matter also, and the photos you take with the Cybershot will appear great! This is because the Cybershot comes equipped with a Carl Zeiss lens. Zeiss lens's are so spectacular that if you are wearing a particularly good pair of eye glasses, the lens is probably a Zeiss lens, and what is good for the human eye is excellent for the eye of a camera. Backing up the lens is a megapixel CCD, which is the heart of a digital camera. The CCD together with the Zeis lens produces sharp, clear, and precise digital photos that look terrific on the computer and can produce high quality prints, if you have the right printer and photo paper.

The Cybershot can be used to edit photos while they are still stored on the Memory stick inside the camera. You can also take 15 second mpeg movies, which does a suprisingly good job picking up sound along with the video. If you have access to the right software, you can stream these 15 second shorts into a longer video that may be used in a presentation or posted on a website. 

The shortcomings of this camera are rather typical of many digital cameras. The batteries are so-called infolithium, which means they are re-chargeable, but they burn fast. You'll hardly ever get more than a real hour of use out of the battery, and frequently you may get less. Buy extra batteries now! It also helps to own other Sony products, like the VAIO laptop. Sony's VAIO laptop will allow you to stick the memory stick directly into the laptop, which means you will not need to own more than one or two memory sticks. Other laptops will work fine, if you purchase PC Card adapter made for the memory stick or have a fire wire (1394 port) connection. A USB connection will work too.

The telephoto feature works up to 10x (5x optical) and this exceeds most digital cameras on the market today. The camera is very easy to control, but there are many buttons and many features, which is typical of a Sony product. You'll have the power to control many of the camera's features manually, if that is your desire. When recording photos you'll have to press down on the snapshot button firmly. The flash works by the flip of a single switch and is powerful enough to shoot in darkness.

There is no viewfinder on this Cybershot. You must use the hybrid LCD, but the LCD is called hybrid because you are supposed to be able to use it even in direct sun light. Not so. Your hand will hav to help shield the LCD from the direct ray of the sun, but do take many photos outside; outdoors is where the 505 excels in recording accurate, clear, fun photos. Get a tripod and go shoot!
