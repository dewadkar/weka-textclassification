            The Jaguar XJS is the older model of the new XK8. The XJS had leather interior with wood grain dash accents, along with a V12 engine with plenty of power to go around. Ive driven this car numerous times due to the fact that my dad owns it. Ithas great handling and plenty of power to smoke anything on the road even though it is nearing the 16 year old marker. Even though the car is older than I am, its still fun to drive and still alot of fun to look at. The car was originally racing silver but then my dad painted it black with little gold flakes. I have to say that I like the Racing silver a whole lot more than the crappy black paint job.<br><br>
