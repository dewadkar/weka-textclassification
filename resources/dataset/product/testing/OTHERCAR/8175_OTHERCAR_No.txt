            I purchased my 2001 A4 in April of that year and in the two years since then I have received what I expected in terms of performance, but I am not at all pleased with the quality control and level of finish.

I ordered the car with performance features: 17 inch tires, sport suspension package, quattro.  It also has the sunroof and power everything.  I only have the 1.8 liter turbo engine but with the manual 5 speed and premium gas it accelerates as quickly as I would ever need.  All of the features have worked reliably and the car handles like a sports car.  Fast cornering is firm and feels secure with little body lean.  The four wheel disk brakes stop the car quickly.  The CD/Radio/Cassette is powerful and has easy to use controls.  I have come to appreciate features like the trip computer, which constantly reports trip gas mileage, current gas mileage, range left in gas tank, trip time and average trip speed.  The cruise control is precise and reliable - you don't get the suddden acceleration found in some cars.  I also found that programmable built in garage door/gate transmitter very convenient; you can program this feature to replace the clip on transmitter that you originally used.  

All of that above you can easily find in many magazine reviews.  What it is more important for me to tell you about are the quality problems I have encountered.  The first problem arose shortly after I purchased the car.  I live in the San Francisco area and on a trip to LA an engine warning light started coming on, just as I was ready to drive back (on a Sunday).  I had to get back, and the manual stated the light was not an emergency situation but I had to have it checked asap.  So I began to drive home.  Soon after I began, as I started up the hills north of LA on Interstate 5, the engine computer started doing something more than turn on a light: it limited engine power to about 40 percent.  I could barely make it up a hill.  I could stop this problem for a while by turning off the car, but for the next 400 miles I was basically driving a Yugo.

Turns out the car had a loose wire.  Disgusting.

Later a squeak developed in the front of the car.
Loose "structural member."

Later still, the arm rest began collapsing under the weight of my arm.  The service guys knew about that problem and promptly replaced the arm rest.

Currently Audi is implementing a massive recall of ignition coils used in my car which are experiencing high failure rates. They wrote me a letter to tell me what to do if a coil fails and promised to get back to me when they have enough in stock to replace mine.  So I guess I just wait for one to fail.....

Besides these defects, I am also disappointed in the body integrity of the car.  There is a lot of body flex noise when the windows are closed. Basically the window frames in the doors are not stiff enough and the glass rubs against the rubber gaskets.  The dealer told me this is normal, but let's just say you don't hear these noises in a BMW, Mercedes or many Japanese cars.

For my $30,000 I got a car that is good, but not good enough if you expect a firm, quiet ride.  Anyone considering a car like this should consider that Audi is not the equal of the other German luxury makes and it might be worth it to pay a little extra for a BMW or Mercedes.

Update: August 2003. More things have gone wrong. Where should I start. Perhaps with the VW/Audi recall of the ignition coils in this and other cars. I was lucky enough that they didn't fail before the dealer replaced them.

Next, the sunroof began not responding to the control wheel. When I told the service advisor about this he quickly said "oh, the potentiometer needs replacing." Apparently yet another defect in this car that is common.

Finally, a squeak under the car has developed. Hit a bump, hear a squeak. No one at the dealer can hear it; only my friends and I. 

Anyone want a car?
