            <b>The brochure promises &quot;people will stare,&quot; and I admit I've already fallen victim to this prediction: every time a new Eclipse whizzes by me, I do just that.</b>
My girlfriend is looking for a new car, and although she is not buying until next year, I feel research is good now because of the incentives that come later... she thinks I'm obsessed. But what does SHE know? (Hope she doesn't read this!)

The Eclipse has been completely redesigned for the upcoming millenium. Gone is the curvy &quot;I look stronger than I really am&quot; shape of old (although my girlfriend says she preferred the old shape). Gone is the turbo-charged 4-cylinder that made for some peppy performance at the expense of a quiet ride. Out of the ashes, however, comes a much more mature Eclipse, that promises to hit the mark on many points for consumers. 

<b>EXTERIOR:  9</b>
Improvements in the Eclipse are easily apparent by looking at the exterior. The <b>build seems more solid than ever before.</b> The track is wider. The body longer. It has a more rigid frame, borrowed from the Mitsubishi Galant. But who cares, right? Looks still matter, and this car is <b>one snappy dresser.</b> The exterior is sleek, with smooth sloping lines. I agree with people who claim it looks very much like a baby 3000GT (which gets dropped this year). It looks like it has real muscle. My girlfriend even made the comment that it looked even a little &quot;Batmobile-ish.&quot; Strong words, eh?

<b>INTERIOR:  7</b>
<b>Major improvements have been made with interior space.</b> Relatively speaking, that is. This is still a sports car for singles/couples, and people are still going to draw straws to see who sits in the back. But there seems to be more headroom, and the old feeling of claustrophobia is gone, thanks to the exterior expansions. The dash seems pretty well laid out. A favorite for my girlfriend was the console sitting on top of the dash that doubled as the clock and stereo display. The factory stereo is six speakers, and is decent enough, although the treble is drowned out by the mid-range. The air conditioning vents are circular and give this car a good sports car feel. Outside of that, however, there really isn't much to rave about the interior. The materials still seem a bit chintzy, and a few glitches exist. Take the rear spoiler. It is clearly in the middle of your rear view mirror. You can see over and below it, but an annoying line crosses right through your line of sight. That was to be expected, however. Sitting in the back seat, my head touched the rear glass. This is a sad trend of sporty hatchback designs. The automatic gears aren't lit on the shifter itself, but are displayed next to the tach. The trunk seems small and shallow but holds a surprising 17cu.ft. of cargo. This even tops the VW Jetta's seemingly enormous trunk (13cu.ft.). But no full-sized spare tire, by the way.

<b>ENGINE:  7</b>
We drove the GT model, which had a 205 HP, 205lb.-ft. torque, 3.0L V6. We were really excited to drive it. Weighing in at only 3120 lbs (w/ auto), this thing should FLY, right? Well... no. It didn't. Okay, okay... but it should have a nice, growling V6, right? Well... no, it sounded more like a drone, which was more annoying than exciting. The horsepower peaks at 5500rpms, which means you have to rev it pretty high to really get any punch out of it. What I really liked though, was the Sportronic automatic transmission. It allows you to slide the lever up and down to shift gears without the use of a clutch. It still doesn't compare to a manual, but I think it's an excellent feature. Even when I took the engine to the redline using it, however, <b>acceleration just didn't seem snappy enough.</b> Don't get me wrong. This car is plenty fast (0-60 in 7.5 sec). You still get decent oomph off the line and confident passing capability throughout the power curve. I guess our expectations were a little too high. I can only speculate that the 4-cylinder is probably louder and weaker. Bear in mind that I did not test a <i>true</i> manual transmission, and performance with it is probably better.

<b>HANDLING &amp; RIDE:  8</b>
The improvements in the body of this vehicle really helped out the handling. It gripped the road very well, with no tire squeal. I took a turn too fast to get onto an entrance ramp, but the tires held very well. There was hardly any lean at all. The GT we drove comes with a host of equipment for this, including a 19mm rear stabilizer bar, 17&quot; alloy wheels, and large ventilated disc brakes. This is for the GT version, mind you- which is the only model that comes with anti-lock brakes. Big minus in my book, all improvements notwithstanding.
The ride shows marked improvements also. It is more refined, but not soft by any stretch of the imagination. Road trips still might be tiring for some.

<b>RELIABILITY:  4</b>
The Eclipse has seen <b>BELOW AVERAGE reliability</b>, according to Consumer Guide. This is important, especially considering the fact that most cars have even MORE trouble when they are redesigned. This should not be left off of your &quot;CON&quot; list. In fact, it is for this solitary reason that I demote the Eclipse to 3 overall stars instead of 4. I do so regretfully because this is a pretty nice car otherwise.

<b>VALUE:  7</b>
The value is not too bad. Our GT was marked for $21,000 on the sticker, which of course could be negotiated lower (my girlfriend is ruthless when it comes to shopping). Again, the only feature that really bugs me is that <b>you have to get the GT package for ABS</b>. That's ridiculous. Still, the GT provides you with nice performance and handling at a decent price, and can be upgraded with one of three packages. All of these packages include a stereo upgrade to an Infiniti AM/FM/cassette &amp; 4CD in-dash changer system. This should sound great considering the small cabin.

<b>THE VERDICT: WE'LL PASS, THANKS:</b>
The Eclipse is a pretty tempting buy, and it's hard for me to dissuade you from considering it. It's certainly more refined and mature than its predecessor, and may be more comfortable to live with than many other sports cars. Mitsubishi may entice you further with its <b>$0 down, zero payments until 2001</b> plan. As for us, the sub-par reliability record and disappointing performance of the Eclipse were enough to steer us away. 

AVERAGE: 7.0 out of 10
