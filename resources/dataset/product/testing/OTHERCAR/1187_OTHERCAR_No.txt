             I bought a 1996 Doge Neon in 1998. I wasn't thrilled with its performance as a winter car - I live in Guelph, Ontario, Canada, where the snow can fly from December to April. But it was fun to drive and cheap on gas. About six months ago, I was told it had an oil leak connected to the head gasket and that this was a common problem in Dodge Neons. I was told that pre-1999 models have a defective head gasket and that over 32 per cent of Neon owners have had to get this problem fixed in their cars. I postponed fixing it until recently and am now paying off a $735. bill, which is a typical repair cost for this problem. I plan to complain to Chrysler and I hope that if enough pre-1999 Dodge Neon owners make lots of noise about the injustice of this problem, Chrysler will be shamed into doing something about it.If anyone has any advice as to how I can go about contacting the right people at Chrysler for answers, I'd be grateful.
