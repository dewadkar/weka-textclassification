            I purchased my first car in October of 1999 and I wanted to avoid used cars at all costs. I had several friends who drove Saturns and they highly recommended them. After pricing several cars, I found that the Saturn SL1 was the best car for my money. I went and test drove one with a friend and absolutely fell in love it! The ride was very smooth and not a lot of outside noise as you hear in other cars.  

There are several options that you can chose from to customize your Saturn SL1 to fit your likes such as a cd player, sunroof, alarm system, etc. One thing that I really liked about the Saturn company is their customer service. They are very quick to help you out and make sure that you are happy as a Saturn owner. The only thing that I didn't like about my new car was that the steering wheel did not tilt like most steering wheels on other cars and the dash seemed so much larger than other cars I had seen. I am very pleased with my purchase and would strongly recommend Saturn to anyone who considers purchasing a new car.<br><br>
