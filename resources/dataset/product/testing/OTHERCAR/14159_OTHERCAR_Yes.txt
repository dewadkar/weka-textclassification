            I think most agree that the Fuji 1300 is a good pick for the price.  This is my first digital camera and so far I enjoy its simplicity and battery life.  The only camera experience I have before this is a Logitech Quickcam which has no comparison in picture quality nor should it.  So far the majority of pictures have turned out nicely but occasionally I get spots that almost look like water drops on the lens and have not figured out what causes this yet.  It may just be a reflection of the flash and it can ruin some really good pics.  This camera produces four different image qualities but I really do not see a difference other than the image size itself. Its USB interface is easy to use and I love the instant gratification of viewing the pictures I just took which is also available on the LCD panel on the back of the camera.  I am sure everyone would like to see better picture quality but I think you have to get real.  For a sub $250 cam, this is a great camera.  You can see some of the pictures I posted at www.photopoint.com and look under mark@quaz.com  <br><br>
