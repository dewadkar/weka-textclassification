            I'll defer quoting all the specs which you've probably seen everyone else repeat already. To me it's appearance is very similar to the Ford Windstar- it's a little plain, but the alloy wheels and headlamps with foglights look nice. We got the EX trim with all the options except ABS brakes. Love the leather seats! Our family of 4 finds the Sedona plenty roomy and comfortable. I've read a few complaints about how it "corners"- since I don't drive it like a sports car, I haven't noticed any problem in that area. Some complain about the gas mileage, but that's due to the fact that the vehicle is SO heavy (a point which makes me and my family feel safer).

<p>My list of complaints is short. I can see that I'll have to spend a little extra time keeping a good wax job on the paint as the clearcoat appears to be a little on the thin side and had a few minor (almost unnoticeable) blotchy areas on the hood. I don't really have any use for the luggage rack- to me it gets in the way when washing and waxing. I sorta wish that all cruise control buttons were on the steering wheel or steering column- it's taken a little time to get used to turning on the cruise on the console and then adjusting with the buttons on the steering wheel (minor issue though- I can get over it.) I find that the bottom storage area of the console for CD's it almost useless- if you don't have your CD cases (jewel cases) lined up just right, it's difficult to get them back into the storage area and to close the hatch. 

<p>There's a few things that I have appreciated with our Sedona: CD player, 3 glove compartments, lots of cup holders, roomy seating even in the 3rd row, we use the sunroof all the time!
