            I absolutely LOVE my 1998 Pontiac Grand Prix and tell everyone about it.  I have never been happier with a car.  I researched for 6 months on every type of vehicle just to find the perfect one.  

The only thing I dislike is the payment, but it's worth it.  The Grand Prix is large enough for a family, yet still looks &quot;sporty&quot;.  I have the SE version, although I would have rather had the GT model.  Price was a big factor and this particular SE was loaded with options.  

The wide track tires give a sense of balance and security when driving on all types of roads.  The gas mileage has been amazing.  On the interstate I can get anywhere from 30-40 miles to the gallon, depending on the season.  City roads I can get between 25-30.  

This has been the easiest car to maintain, too.  I keep up with regular oil changes and servicing and have yet to have any mechanical problems with the Grand Prix.  

The trunk space is huge and the back seat is comfortable with room for legs.  The 3.9 liter v-6 engine is the best option and you can't get a quieter car.  Sometimes I have to double check that the car is actually running!  AND my insurance is very low because of all the safety features on this car. 

If you want a car that handles great, is large enough for a family, and looks sharp, you will not be disappointed with the Pontiac Grand Prix!<br><br>
