            I owned a black Twin Turbo 300ZX for about 3 years.  It was the most awesome car I ever owned.  It has blistering power, with plenty of modifications available aftermarket if I ever needed more.  The car is a work of art asthetically, the ergonomics are splendid, the seats are so very comfortable, the 5 speed shifts easily, and the handling is very responsive.  The car has a few neat gimmicks too, like it's adjustable shocks that are controlled by a simple switch in the console.  One setting gives you a smooth, comfortable ride, almost like a Lexus.  The other setting is harder and intended for extreme handling.  The turbo car also has the HICAS system, which is a rear wheel steering system of sorts.  It only works at speeds above 35 MPH, and is intended to give more stability and cornering power to amateur drivers.  It only adjusts the rear wheels a few degrees, and I never really noticed the difference when I was driving the car.  I'm not sure if either the adjustable suspension or the HICAS system really enhances the performance of the car, but they are neat bells and whistles.  The car was generally reliable, but it is a high performance car, so things can break, and when they do, they can be expensive.  But, compared to other supercars like Porches, you will still spend less.  The car also has the typical sportscar visibility problems, particularly in the blind spot.  The big door pillar blocks your view and makes lane changes difficult in traffic.  The rear window also provides minimal visibility.

I had to sell my car after I got married.  It was my choice, but oh do I miss that car.  Someday when I have spending money again, I intend to hunt down another one.
