            In the winter of 1999 I found myself in the market for a new set of cost effective wheels. Since I lived in snow country a small to medium SUV or one of the AWD sedans seemed like a good bet.

After researching the alternatives I had a short list that included the Rodeo and Subaru Legacy along with the Kia Sportage. The Rodeo was disqualified due to a huge number of negative reviews on the internet and elsewhere, but the other two were still in the running. After a few test drives I purchased the Kia. The model I got was a Sportage EX with everything, leather, premium sound, dealer added hitch, the works. It was actually the car the dealer used at the auto show earlier that year, and it was decked out.

It has turned out to be one of the worst choices I've ever made. In the beginning everything SEEMED OK.

Driving the Sportage was pleasant, with a reasonably good ride and better than average cornering and steering, provided, as rumor has it, by the Lotus chassis design crew. The engine was anemic and the automatic transmission made things much worse by often refusing to use first gear, even if it was clearly needed. Noise was probably about average, but the type of noise was a bit annoying. It was composed largely of the engine sounding like it was constantly straining to haul the vehicle around. 

In town the short wheelbase and generally great visibility made maneuvering in parking lots a breeze, as was most city driving, as long as sudden acceleration was not needed. Pulling away from a stop sign afforded almost enough time to balance my check book or read a short novel. 

On rough roads the doors and spare tire rack would rattle loudly, and the anti-lock brakes would often over react and make stopping almost impossible. This odd 'safety feature' would also manifest itself on ice. And speaking of safety, the Sportage does have a driver knee airbag in addition to the more common front airbags above the waist.

Inside the leather was nice, the seats were comfortable and the stereo was clear, if a bit thin on bass. Sadly, the inside clearly looked like a $13,000 SUV, not a $19,000 dollar one. A lesson is in here - no matter how much one adds leather, fancy sound and other options, the car is at its' core not any different from its' less equipped brothers, and it shows. Although this was a decked out Sportage, it was oddly devoid of things one often takes for granted in Euro or Japanese cars, like power seats and lots of little interior lights.  

Then the fun started.

First, in all fairness I should point out that when I bought mine the warranty was much shorter than later models, a feature whose importance should not be underestimated for this automobile. Second, I see Sportages driving around with what appear to be sane and satisfied drivers, so it appears that my experience is not completely typical. On the other hand a short review of this Epinions section shows that this car does in fact seem to have issues with some consistency. Your mileage may vary as they say.

In my case the car began having problems at about 2400 miles, when it ceased to idle properly. This was covered under warranty and except for losing the use of the car for a week all seemed OK.

Next there was a series of recalls, and after one particular recall (for front hub seals) I began to experience what seemed to be tremendous and random drag on the car. In some cases the car would begin to sound labored and actually would decelerate while going downhill with the throttle wide open. Multiple trips to the authorized service center resulted in no improvement. 

After much sparring with the mechanics I finally left the car at the shop with the promise that until they fixed it I wasn't coming back. About 2 weeks later the shop called and said it was fixed, but couldn't seem to explain what was found. I went in, test drove the car and decided to take it home. This problem never came back.

In the next few months:

- The paint on the fender flares peeled off.
- The spare tire latch stopped working.
- Various lights would intermittently stop working.
- The car would shift oddly.
- The 4WD stopped working.

And other stuff. I've forgotten a lot, but I have over 20 pages (!) of service records.

Finally, one night 3 hours form home the tail lights refused to come on. After a short investigation I found a burned 5 amp fuse. Since the only nearby open store had 7.5 amp fuses I used those. The next morning I went out and again, the fuse was blown. I had 5 amp fuses at home, so I replaced it and stocked a few spares in the car.

One morning a few weeks later the car refused to run at all. In the end the shop discovered that the 3 main wire harnesses were completely shot and needed replacing. After almost $2200 in repairs the Kia came back, but I was afraid to drive it, and since the warranty was up and I'd since been forced to get a replacement car (used Subaru - great car) in the months the repair took I just parked the Kia.

After about 13 months I decided to try driving it again, but to my dismay I found the following:

- When I stepped on the brake the park lights came on.
- When using cruise control the turn signals would cancel cruise.
- The transmission would shift out of 4th if the headlights were turned on.
- And a bunch of other odd but thankfully forgotten behaviors.

When I approached the authorized service center about the issues I was brushed off. They couldn't service this since time (but no miles) had elapsed.

I traded the Kia on a new Diesel Jetta and my blood pressure is a lot lower now.
