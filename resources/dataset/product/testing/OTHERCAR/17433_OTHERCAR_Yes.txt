            The Honda Passport has something going for it that most SUVs don't, personality.  With its contoured shape and unique rear styling, the Passport stands out among the more boring, traditional SUV's.  Driving the Passport is a complete dream.  With a ton of horsepower behind you, there is never a worry when venturing out into the snow or when merging onto busy, rush-hour highway traffic.  At the same time as you are enjoying the features of a nicely equipped Passport, you will not have to worry about breaking the bank.  One can purchase a Passport with a good amount of amenities for much less than a comparable Jeep Grand Cherokee or the like might cost.  Another nice feature of the Passport is the option for a standard transmission, my personal choice.  You are in for a great ride when you get behind the wheel of Honda Passport!
Happy trails friends and good luck with your trials of miles and miles of trials!<br><br>
