            I ordered my truck before they were officially out.  I come from a GM family, I was due for a new vehicle (my last one was 13 years old) and I was chomping at the bit to order this one.

This truck has a very smooth ride and does not ride like a "truck."  It has a great turning radius, which is a huge improvement over my last GMC truck (from 1984.)

I love having the 3rd row seat available.  The leg room is very little for the folks back there...its good for short runs...but not long hauls (unless they are small children.)  We have packed in a total 7 full-grown men in that truck.  The 3rd row seats are easy to remove...but they are a little heavy.  I'm female, and not weak by any stretch of the imagination, but these seats are not featherlight as some of the adds make them out to be.  Be careful, as you might scratch up the plastic if you really roll them out of the truck.

I live in a burb of a large city.  I easily get 15/16 mpg on a typical week going to work and running errands.  I get @ 20 while on the highway.

I also got a sunroof.  I have been VERY happy with it...I just love it.  I have heard of leaks and such...so proceed with caution.  Mine just has a small rattle (the shade part)...but other than that its great.

The tinted mirrors are just WONDERFUL.  It might take a little while to get used to...but I love them.  I am one of those who's eyes are pretty sensitive to light.  So, the mirror is dim at night.  You can still see headlights just fine, but they aren't glaring and blinding.  If you have sensitive eyes...you know what I mean!

Stepping into the truck might be a little difficult for shorter people.  I have no problem with it.  I have "assist steps" or running boards.  Sometimes I use them, sometimes not.  I'm 5'9".   For some, the steps might not be sticking out quite enough and could be bothersome.  Getting out, you have to make sure you turn your feet just right.

I had to downgrade to the LS in order to get the Dark Carmine Red Metallic color (Maroon.)  So...I did not get onstar, heat seats.

If you get a lift-gate...just be careful of opening it up in the garage..you might scratch up the paint.  It is a good idea to drive a truck home in your garage (if you park it there.)  Now-a-days, garages aren't very big.  If you will have another vehicle in the garage too...test it out and make sure there is plenty of room.  I have heard of many people getting Suburbans and they can't get it in the garage, or they BARELY fit it in there.  I haven't herd much problems with the Tahoes.

After paying so much money for the vehicle, I wish they would have had a few more gadgets...like allowing you to program things on your truck.  Everything is so computerized now...surely the owner should be able to program more.  I wish it had something digitally displaying fuel left and maybe even the gas mileage.

This truck is just what I expected.  It feels very solid and smooth.  I come from a family who has owned Chevy's for years and we keep them for 10 to 15 years.  I am hoping to keep this truck for a long time.  I am now always the one to drive everyone to lunch ;)  Everyone remarks on how nice the leather is and how roomy it is (even for larger men.)

Here is a very good site for Yukons & Tahoes

My site...I have pics of my truck and info about it.  I haven't updated it lately....oh well.
