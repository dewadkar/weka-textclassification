            My first digital camera and a good choice for the money.  You must buy the battery recharger which is well worth the 100 bucks, you can find these at most electronic or computer stores, I got mine at J&amp;R (they have a website also).  Without the recharger you will be spending $10.00 a battery which will last you about 40 pics.  

This is a great camera for the beginner digital photographer who wants quality pictures (very sufficient for printing or websites).  You can also buy additional memory cards so you don't have to download pics to your computer after taking about 38 pics.  My husband has never been one to take pictures but after buying this camera I can't pry it from his hands.  <br><br>
