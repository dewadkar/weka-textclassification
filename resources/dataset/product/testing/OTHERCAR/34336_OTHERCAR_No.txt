              My company has supplied all of the DM's with Century's (also Impala's, and a couple of Crown Vic's).  Over the past 4 months, I have gotten a pretty good feel for the car, and overall, I feel it is adequate.
  The design is quite good, certainly more stylish than a Camry or Accord outside.  The fit &amp; finish on all 4 cars is fine- not &quot;jewel-like&quot;, but the seams all fit, and even the window trims (one of GM's longtime bugaboos) are flush and look durable.  Inside, the design is rather conservative... my dad would feel quite at home in here!  Generally, the materials are quite good... however, the seats are disappointing.  All 4 cars are under 30K, and the foam is becoming quite &quot;lifeless&quot;, VERY evident as one moves from a less used to more heavily used car.  This does not bode well for long term durability.
  You feel as if you are sitting low in the car, as the sill &amp; dash are quite high, legs out front.  Personally, I like sitting high, in more chair-like seats, (like a SAAB) and lower sills &amp; dash, like a Honda.
  Oddly, when the windows are powered up &amp; down, the whole door panel flexes!  This is rather odd, and appears, well, rather underengineered.
  I find this at odds with the overall feel of the car, which feels very, very solid... this from GM!!
   On the road is where the car begins to underwhelm.  The 3100 performs very well, launching the car quickly and with a mountain of torque.  The traction control is much appreciated (okay, I don't mention this to my boss!), and is quiet when settled in at speed.  My nice comments about the driving experience end here.
   Under even moderately hard acceleration, and at anything nearing higher RPM's makes quite a racket... even with as much sound deadener as the car has!  C'mon GM... pushrod engines went out with carbs... and for good reason.  
   After coming up to cruising speed, you may have need to change direction.  To say that the Century feels &quot;confused&quot; is an understatment.  The center of gravity must lie fairly high... this amplified by soft springing makes it astoundingly to get the car to &quot;take a set&quot; entering a corner.  These traits are compounded by cheesy tires with no real shoulder, a power steering system that is completely devoid of any feeling ('cept torque steer) whatever, and a steering wheel not much wider than a coathanger!  I find myself approaching corners much as if the road were slippery.  If you see a Century blocking your way on a corner, don't get upset... the driver is likely doing all they can!
   Wanna stop?  You get adequate power to do it... however it is delivered through a pedal that seems to have been designed to remove any feeling of &quot;connection&quot;.  Overassisted like 70's Ford steering!
   Overall, I think that they are an okay car.  Some people expect  little in the way of performance or excitement from a car.  And the reliability of the cars has been fine, too (nothing but minor things- squeaks, lightbulbs, etc.).  However, I would not like to live with it... it is boring to a degree that would even impress a Camry owner!  But it would make a fine rental, or company car.
   Ephemeraly, I would ask &quot;What is this car's purpose&quot;?  It feels like a top trim level Chevy (actually, the Impala is nicer inside &amp; better equipped!).  Is Buick even relevant as a brand anymore?  I would argue not...
