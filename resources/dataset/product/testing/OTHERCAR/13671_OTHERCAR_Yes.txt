            My wife and I recently purchased a 99 Isuzu Trooper and I feel like we stole it.  We have a 6 month old so we needed the room of an SUV and didn't want a mini-van.  We wanted to spend around $20,000 and have never owned a foreign vehicle.  I already have a 96 Jeep Cherokee which I thought I liked.  We looked at the Explorer, the Grand Cherokee, GMC Jimmy, and the Nissan X-terra.  To stay in the 20,000 range we were thinking used and were about to buy a 97 Grand Cherokee.  On the way home from the dealership we passed an Isuzu dealer and decided to check it out on a whim.  We test drove the Trooper and fell in love immediately.  We actually liked it better than all of the trucks we test drove and it cost about $10,000 less.  We couldn't believe we could get a brand new truck of this quality for $20,000.  Needless to say we purchased it a week later and have been ecstatic ever since.  We have already taken it through snow in the mountains of West Virginia on a ski trip and have been on the beaches of North Carolina and it does great off-road!  It is also a great road trip vehicle because of all the room and comfort.  I still can't believe it, everything we wanted, (car alarm, power everything, cruise control, etc.) all for about $20,000.  I would recommend anyone in the market for an SUV seriosly consider the Trooper!<br><br>
