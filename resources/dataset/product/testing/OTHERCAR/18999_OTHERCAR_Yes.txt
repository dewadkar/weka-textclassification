            I looked at the Tiburon after looking at several other cars.  I purchased the Tiburon about a month ago and I, frankly have never been more pleased with a new car.

I purchased the GT-V6 with the 6-speed manual with Leather Interior.  As stated in another review go to the Hyundai website and check out the standard features.  I'll highlight a couple.  7 speaker (that includes a sub-woofer) stereo with CD player, 17" rims, Super BIG 4 wheel disks, just take a look.  The low end torque is great but the top end leaves something to be desired.  I would love to see about an extra 25 horses under the hood.  But that really is a nit.  Also you pay for the great handling with a VERY stiff ride.

UPDATE

I have now put around 3K miles on the car and I still love it.  I have had 0 problems that required any returns to the shop.  Usually by this point, particularly with a stiff suspension, you start to get little rattles etc.  So far I have not had any and I hit high numbers of potholes etc due to my location and poor road conditions.  Overall I am still very pleased.

I was a little concerned with gas mileage but now that I have some time on the car I have found that I had a tendency to stay in a lower gear far to long.  My first tank averaged 24.5 mpg.  I filled up yesterday after paying attention to when I shifted (particularly true if you are used to a 5-speed vs a 6-speed) and I was up to 27.4 mpg.  Now to be fair I am also going a little slower then I did when I first got the car.

AFTER I bought the car I read the Motor Trend article on the racing and stock Tib.  I will not repeat it here and it is available (for now) on the web.  I will provide the caption under one of the photos of 2 smiling drivers however,  

"The $19,000 Tiburon GT V6 lapped just 1.5 seconds behind a $57,000 Porsche Boxster S. The racing Tiburon's lap times shamed a mighty Corvette Z06"

And I did not pay 19K!!!!  That is the MSRP!!

UPDATE

I have now had the car for about 9 months.  Still no problems.  It has had 2 minor recalls.  1 was for a modification to the computer software for the o2 sensor.  The result of this was that my gas mileage has now increased about 1 MPG.  The second is to move a bracket for a brake line to prevent wear.  Neither is a big deal.  Still no rattles or loose sounds in the car.  No problems with the AC/C or heat.  Actually I can say that this car has the best heater of any car I have owned.  I would like to see seat heaters offered as an option.  Leather is COLD in December even in Memphis.  I honestly LOVE this car
