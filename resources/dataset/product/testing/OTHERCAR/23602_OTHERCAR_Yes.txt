            	I bought this car b/c it was the only good car that I found for $4,000. It has a power seat, tilt, cruise, 4-disc all round, a 3.3l pushrod v-6 that needs a little sprucing up, basically every option except the bigger engine, a sunroof, premium sound system (but it does already have a factory 7-speaker system installed), autostick (if applicable for that year), there's something else that I am missing, but it's not an ES, but it does have every option that you can get w/o getting an ES.	There isn't anything that I hate about this car, okay it could use a bigger sound system, but if you know anything about LH vehicles you know that takes about an hour to fix. The 3.3l is pretty peppy. I like this motor better b/c it is easier to work on than the 3.5l, and it uses pushrods. One of the drawbacks though is that there are hardly any available performance upgrades for it. I found a computer chip and a performance ignition, but that's about it for bolt-on. I am getting dual exhaust though. The only thing that I dislike about this car is that it needs more power.	Driving this vehicle is a dream. It corners better than many other cars in it's class and price range, it has a quiet, smooth ride. It handles snow almost like an AWD vehicle. It's just plain awesome. One thing about it though. If you buy one, there are two character flaws (everyone has a character flaw).	The first one is that the transmissions go out earlier than expected. In the early 1990's ('90 -'93), Chrysler was experimenting with electronically controlled automatic transmissions. Call it an experiment gone wrong. The solution is to buy a rebuilt transmission that fixes the factory mistake or to get your's rebuilt. It's cheeper to buy a rebuilt one.	The other problem is that the A/C unit goes bad. I forget which part, but I have been told about it. So if you have this car, just make sure that you have a little extra cash in case something goes wrong. Neither of these problems have happened to me. I am assuming that is b/c my Intrepid only has 85,000 miles on it.	Everyone should have the privilege to drive an Intrepid. It's not near as fast as my other car (a '77 Plymouth Volare' 318), but it's like a Cadilac for 1/2 the price. It's just plain awesome!<br><br>
