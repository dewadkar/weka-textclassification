            OK I own one of these cars, actually the ACR model. Basically this car has absolutely none of the features you would expect on a &quot;modern&quot; sports car like the Porche or Corvette. No ABS (this is a bad thing), no traction control, no active handling. It also has no cup holders, no electric adjustable seats and no cruise control. It's noisy and it shakes like a old tractor when it idles. 

What it does have though is the best performance of ANY sports car out there, with the exception of super exotics such as the F40, F50. It has incredible handling (but a steep learning curve) and super reliability (because of it's simplicity). Just driving this car to work gives me an adrenaline rush because of it's visceral performace. The car is also easy to drive in traffic and surprisingly comfortable.

Be prepared for attention also. People will say things like &quot;nice Porche&quot; or &quot;cool car&quot; if you own own of those other marques. If you own a Viper  they will stare and say things like &quot;Holy sh#t!&quot;. Be prepared to be photographed (no I'm not joking) and have people discussing your car when your in public places.

If you are considering buying one of these cars be prepared to pay additional money for high performance driving schools and track time. If you don't you will either 

a) waste your money or 
b) be a danger to yourself and others because your incapable of handling this machines power.

If your willing to invest the money and time to learn how to drive this machine then it quite simply is the ultimate. If your not, stick to the Corvette or the Porche. They'll give you a good deal of the performance plus the saftey features that will keep you out of (most) trouble. They will also give you more annonimity ;-)
