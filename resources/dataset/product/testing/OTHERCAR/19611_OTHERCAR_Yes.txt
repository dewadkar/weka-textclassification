            I love my 1999 Saturn SC2!!  It literally saved my life!  I originally bought this car for it's appearance, cost, saftey record and friendly service at Saturn of Hempstead in NY. After driving this car for 6 months, the only complaint I had was that it wasn't a 6 cylinder (something I knew when I bought it).
During the snow storm we had in January, I skidded through an intersection and SLAMMED into the back tire of a flat bed truck! Had I not been able to turn the car the little bit I did, I would have decappetated my car and possibly my head!  Instead, a life threatening car accident ended up being somewhat minor.  The Saturn did EXACTLY what it was supposed to do in a car accident.  I bounced off the rear tire of the truck, and although the air bag cut the inside of my lip, that was all the injuries I incurred.  My car didn't even look like I had hit the truck...maybe a small compact(HAHA)!  The cost of fixing the car was a lot cheaper than I expected as well.  My insurance gave me no problems in paying the claim.
For anyone that is looking for a SAFE, good looking car...SATURN SC2 is the one for you!!!  Test drive one today!!!
P.S. - I haven't met anyone yet that doesn't love the third door!!<br><br>
