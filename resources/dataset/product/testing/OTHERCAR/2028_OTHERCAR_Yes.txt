            I have recently bought a 2000 Milenium edition of the Grand Marquis and am very happy with it.I love the style and the most comfortable leather reclining seats. I have recently taken it on a trip of 2400 miles and received 20 MPG.on highway driving. I have found that it does drive a little rougher than I anticipated and in comparison to my sable. I find it to be very comfortable riding in the passenger seat and just love the roominess it provides.The trunk holds all my necessary shopping needs. If I had to choose a car again it would be the same one.<br><br>
