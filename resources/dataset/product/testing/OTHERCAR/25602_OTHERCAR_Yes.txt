            My family decided to lease this car mainly on the basis of a great lease price offered by a neighborhood dealer, but we quickly fell in love with the car. The bottom-line is that it is a lot of fun to drive, it corners well, and has a pick up comparable to a sports car. It is a very comfortable car, offering all the benefits of a luxury car at a great value. It is also one of the safest cars around, which also happens to be one of its drawbacks. Unfortunately, we've had a few minor bumps on this car, but since this car is designed to break apart like a formula one car at the slightes hint of an impact, even small bumps do some costly damage to the body. We've also had a lot of problems with the included CD changer, which is extremely tempermental to extreme weather. 
Another huge benefit is that Saabs in general are usually listed as the model car least likely to be stolen -- as I'm sure everyon knows, when a car is stolen it's usually strippen and the parts are sold, well, Saab designed Saab parts to only be used with Saabs, therebye decreasing the value of stripped Saab parts.<br><br>
