            There are things in life that I <i>just don't get.</i> Synchronized swimming as an Olympic event. Hiring prostitutes as an Olympic event. (Okay, I get that but I wonder if the selection committee brought along their judges...six-five, six-seven, six-three.) And, on a the subject of paying to get screwed, I don't understand buying a pickup to replace the car in your urban or suburban garage. 

Alas, no one in Detroit checks with me before proceeding on these things.  About ten years ago pickups started breaking out of their traditional workman markets. The automakers responded by sanding away the hard edges of their trucks, which brought in more buyers and encouraged more refinement, until today you have pickups that ride and feel like cars, and cars that have the body of a pickup but none of the practicality. For proof of the latter I present the Chevrolet S-10 Extended Cab 2WD.

This is my roommate's truck and at first glance it's not horrible. The styling isn't as eye-catching as it was when Chevy remade the truck in 1994 but it has aged better than the softer lines of the Ford Ranger and the paint quality is leagues ahead of what used to be considered good for a truck. The interior is especially well designed and finished in the LS package trim. In black it has a sporty feel, with supportive bucket seats, a short reach to anywhere in the cab and excellent ergonomics. It's a comfortable place to spend some time but the shortage of space makes this one of the last vehicles I'd want to use for an extended road trip with even one passenger. There are fold-out jump seats in the extended cab model but don't even think about assigning anyone over the age of ten to those torture devises for anything longer than a trip to the store. (Or even that far-more later.)

The ride is very car like, smooth and quiet. But problems soon begin to show up. This truck has the 2.2 liter four-cylinder engine and the four speed automatic transmission. This has to be the worst powertrain package since Yugo went away. It's feels like a car engine, smooth and quiet, but that's where it's redeeming qualities end. The engine makes just 120hp to move 3,200 pounds. Acceleration from a stop is acceptable but passing power is a joke. And with the aerodynamics of a three bedroom ranch the gas mileage never climbs out of the low twenties. Either choose the four banger with the five speed manual so you can wring it's neck or lay out a few hundred dollars more for the 195hp V-6. (Or consider Nissan or Toyota, who deliver a more acceptable 140hp from their base four cylinder engines.)

Once you get past the initial impressions and start to live with the S-10 the compromises in its design quickly become obvious. For reasons unknown the payload capacity is a mere 1,184 pounds in 2WD trim. Opt for the tougher looking 4WD and the bed can hold only 935 pounds. Towing capacity for both is rated at 2,000 pounds, but with the anemic performance with nothing behind the truck I wouldn't be in a hurry to hook anything to the bumper. Ground clearance for the 2WD truck is no better than a car, so while it looks like a truck it's as likely to get stuck off road as a car, as my roommate found out on the Fourth of July. Finally, the car-like interior is the last place you want to get into after a day of doing the kind of dirty work you'd expect to be able to do in a truck.

But wait, the S-10 isn't just a pathetic excuse for a truck. It's equally inept at being a car no matter how hard it tries. On dry pavement the S-10 understeers reassuringly when pushed to the limit. But add a little snow or rain and everything changes. With only the weight of the bed over the rear tires it takes constant vigilance to keep the back end from coming around. It also means the it will be the first vehicle to get stuck in snow, a situation made even worse by the car-like tires included with the alloy rims on the LS package. And while the brakes have sufficient power to stop the truck, the poor weight distribution places most of the stopping power over the front tires and braking distance increases accordingly. Wet pavement only makes a bad situation worse. The standard anti-lock brakes help prevent skidding under braking but won't make the S-10 stop in a shorter distance. Brake performance compared to even the cheapest new car is simply abysmal.

Only some convertible sports cars like the Corvette and Honda S2000 have less interior room. The extended cab does create a nice place to throw stuff. But the inclusion of the mini jumpseats is criminal in my book. Through a loophole in Department of Transportation laws, pickups do not have to meet many of the safety regulations required on cars so the automakers are free to put seats wherever they want as long as they have a seatbelt. Even if they are childsized planks no adult could wedge themselves into even if they wanted. Before buying look at those seats and imagine what happens to the occupants if the truck gets t-boned? Unbolt these seats and use the rear part of the cab for carrying a few grocery bags before you are tempted to use them.

The bed does give the S-10 a bigger trunk than any car on the road-until it rains. My roommate has a tonneau cover which protects his stuff from the elements but eliminates the usefulness of having the bed in the first place, the &quot;trunk&quot; is barely more than a foot high and only an arms-reach deep. 

At one time you could put up with these shortcomings because trucks were substantially less expensive than cars. But with only a modest trip through the options list (not even equipped with power windows or door locks) his S-10 cost more than $18,000. For that money you can get into any number of good new cars that offer better performance, gas mileage, safety and convenience. Look at the late model used market and your choices increase exponentially. 

The S-10 is a first for me. I've never before spent time with a car, truck-whatever that did nothing wrong like break down or feel like a piece of junk and still left me wondering why anyone would want to part with their money for it? But I've never before met a vehicle that did nothing wrong and yet could still do nothing right.
