            My husband bought this camera for us about eight months ago.  It is an invaluable resource for home and work.  

The MVC-FD73 is so easy to use that, my mother, who still can't figure out how to check her email(Sorry Mom), can use it with ease.

Many of my colleagues have digital cameras.  They are always having problems figuring out how to use them, especially how to hook them up to their computers to view the photographs they have taken.

The best part about this camera is that there is really nothing to figure out!  You just insert a floppy disk, take your pictures, insert your disk into the disk drive and view them from your file manager(or other compatible program.)  They can easily be viewed on an IBM or Macintosh.

You can choose from several effects. Take your pictures in regular form, solarized (I don't really know why), black &amp; white, negative art or sepia.
I use the regular effect for all of my pictures and I can't see the reason for the other effects, except maybe black &amp; white, but they are fun to play around with anyway. 

 I guess other people would know what to do with the other effects.  I don't and it doesn't matter.  This camera is great for a person like me who just needs a camera that is easy to use.  

I do use the zoom feature which is a sliding button that you just slide left or right until you get the shot that you want.

Once you take your pictures, you can view and delete them by EASILY going to the play mode and using the menu bar.

Another feature I occasionally use is the brightness adjuster.  You just hit the plus or minus button until you like the lighting of the shot.  You can also EASILY turn the flash on and off with a button.

I don't always get the best pictures but it takes practice and time to get the right shot and time is something I never seem to have enough of.

One example of a poor shot is my profile picture.  I took a picture of a photograph and it came out pretty dark.  I took a few different ones but none of them came out any better. The picture was actually dark to begin with and I thought the digital camera might be able to lighten it up but it didn't. The pictures on my website are also pictures taken from photos and they came out clear as a bell.

I have taken lots of shots for auction items that came out incredible.  Outside shots seem to come out much clearer than inside ones.

I have also taken lots of photos of my son that came out great.

At school I have taken many pictures of my students and put them onto Kidpix on my Macintosh.  They came out very good.

One other thing that I like about this camera is that the battery is the same one that I use for my video camera.  We have three batteries and always keep one on the charger for emergencies.

If you are looking for an easy camera that takes clear pictures (with a little practice) then this one is for you.<br><br>
