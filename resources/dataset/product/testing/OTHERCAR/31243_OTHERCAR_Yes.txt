            My wife bought her 95' Grand Am brand new.  She drove it for nearly five years without a single mechanical problem.  When we traded it in, it had 80,000+ miles on it, and never required more than routine maintenance.

I really liked this car.  It wasn't fancy, but it got you there.  The interior was roomy enough up front, and the back seats would fit two more without them being professional contortionists.  It has plenty of power too, and the mileage was pretty good.  The six cylinder engine in this two door made it go down the road smoothly,  with plenty of passing power.  You won't be sitting in luxury seats, but we went plenty of places that took a full day on the road and then some without getting uncomfortable.  It has a sporty look, and the finish never got a scratch, even though it should have!  The 95' Grand Am gets an &quot;A&quot; from me for reliability too.

The Grand Am is not going to win any contests when it comes to a smooth ride.  My wife had opted for the sportier suspension, which we wouldn't do again if we had to do it over.  I felt like it rode way to hard, considering.  The other thing was the trunk lid.  You had to be careful how you put things in the trunk.  If you weren't careful, you could smash something with the support arms when you put the lid down.  They protruded down into the trunk pretty far.  The car also developed a few rattles as it got older, but nothing that was out of line.

I'd recommend this car to someone who wanted their first car, didn't want to spend a ton yet get a good vehicle, or to someone who wanted dead bang reliability.  This is not a car for someone who is used to foreign jobs like a Maxima, Camry, or Accord.<br><br>
