            hello again. RX5 is obviously a sweet looking car. Its got the luxury of a Mercedes, and the ruggedness of a Land Rover. Even though it is expensive, it is a 100% worth-it kind of car to buy. With its standad leather seat and roomy cabin, it blows all other luxury suv's away. With its V6 engine and 4.6 liter, its speed is excessively high. No offense to the Ford trucks, but this truck has the speed. With its cargo room in back and excess leg room for the kids, this truck is a value car.
The negatives to this car is its lack of durablility. I have to take it onto the shop 1 or twice a month b/c the brakes dont work. This car is not the type of truck that you want to take to the hills or mountains for a hiking trip. Instead, you can take it into the city to show it off and have a nice, smooth ride in the country. This car will make heads turn and reviewers call it the luxury model of the year. i belive it will be the biggest hit from the BMW's since the Z3 roadster. <br><br>
