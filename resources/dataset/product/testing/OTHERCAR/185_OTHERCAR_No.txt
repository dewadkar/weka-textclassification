                My family and I are from Maryland and we bought a 1998 Chevrolet Tracker in October of 1998. We bought it because it does have a lot of room for being a small SUV, and it accommodated our family needs great.
    It was seemingly a good vehicle when we first bought it. It drove nice, the seats are very comfortable, everything is in easy access inside, and has a lot of legroom (much more than we expected). 
    The most disagreeable part of this vehicle is the windshield and the defroster. When it started to snow that winter and get cold with the windshield started to fog... dangerously. After a couple of minutes with the defroster on full speed and doing 55mph down a highway you end up with a binocular vision. Meaning that the windows are completely fogged up except for a small binocular shaped area in the center. 
    The side windows would freeze over (on the inside) and fog up making it completely unusable for peripheral vision. The mirrors on the outside were pretty much useless too. The only window that was usable was the rear window because it had the defrosting wires in it. 
    Because of that it is not a safe car in the winter. Other than that it is enjoyable to drive. In conclusion this car is definitely better suited for those who live in a warmer climate, where the winters are not so cold or cold at all.<br><br>
