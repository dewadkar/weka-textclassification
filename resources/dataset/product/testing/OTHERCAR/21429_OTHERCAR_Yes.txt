            The 2001 Hyundai Elantra is an excellent car for the money.  It offers safety features that are only on more expensive cars.  It has good handling and rides very quiet on the road. 
The car has good trunk room and ample room for four.
The car offers the best warranty on the market today. I bought one with the ABS/Traction Control feature to ensure more stability and better handling. The controls are easy to use and the defroster is very good. I recommend remote entry, it just makes life easier.  
This car, however, does not get very good gas mileage.  I get between 28-30 miles per gallon on the highway with the four speed automatic.
You can not custom make or order your car with all the options available by Hyundai. Be very careful what the dealer tells you about the car.  I experienced many dealers who were not very knowledgeable about the options offered by Hyundai. One dealer told me that I could not get the ABS/Traction Control option for my area.  Research your car very carefully and know all the facts about the Elantra.
I am constantly being asked what kind of car this is. Everyone I talk to admires the car for its looks. The people that ride in the car compare its handling and ride to that of bigger cars.  The Elantra stacks up well with the Honda Civic and Nissan Sentra.  It has much more room than the Toyota Corolla. It also costs much less and gives you more for your money.
