            The BMW 3 series has long been the class yardstick.  All other car makers try to compare their cars favorably to the 3, but BMW has been up to the task and continues to raise the bar.  My exposure to the 323Ci is limited to the two short test drives I had back in June of 2000 when I was shopping for a car.  Here's how I 
remember it.

Intro
The 323Ci is new for 2000.  Traditionally, BMW coupes are more expensive than their 4 door counterparts.  In return, it is equipped with Sport suspension and other goodies that are optional on the sedan.  No body panels are shared with the 4 door.  Even the side mirrors are exclusively for the coupe.

Performance

The 323Ci is a 2.5liter I-6.  BMW says it makes 170hp.  When the 2.5 liter engine was the top engine for the previous 3 series, it's published output was 189hp.  
The seat of my pants say the new 2.5 is every bit as strong as the old, and probably stronger down in the more commonly used 2000~4000 rpm range.  

The BMW 5 speed transmission is simply the best I have ever touched.  Short, smooth, sure.  This is a must experience for every enthusiast. 

The Coupe looks aerodynamic, and the quietness in the cabin at highway speeds back this up.  The car is comfortable at highway speeds, even with the sport suspension.  

The salesperson drove it out of the parking lot.  I asked him to turn off the DSC traction control.  It was misty, and the car nearly lost control pulling out of the parking lot.  With the DSC on, it was like driving on a dry day. 

The thing about BMW is that its performance is much more than specifications.  It is the wonderfully balanced feel that it has under driving conditions that gives the driver a great sense of control.  

Style
Outside, the 3 series is beautifully elegant.  Its lines are strong, simple.  BMW has a knack for making their cars look modern yet evoke the images of models past.  Everyone knows they've seen a BMW, without ever looking at the badge.

The Ci has a sleeker profile than the iS it replaces.  Parked side by side with the old model, the lineage is unmistakable, but the new coupe is flat out better looking.  

On the inside, it is a little too spartan to be called luxurious.  As a sport coupe, this is acceptable.  The cup holders (uncovered holes in the console) were out of line with the rest of the interior.  It also did not seem to be deep enough to be useful.  

What you notice when you open the door on this car is that the window will move down slightly.  The salesman says the window pushes into the rubber molding to make a tighter seal when the door is closed.  Hmm, I wonder how long that would last.  Still, it's a neat thing to see. 

Small adjustments in the seat will put you in a near perfect driving position.  The instrumentation is simple and easy to read.  I didn't get to see how it looks in the dark.  

Utility
Bigger in every way than the previous 3, the BMW Ci is comfortable up front, and a little less so in the back.  The trunk is still among the smallest in the class, but it will haul a grocery visit with no problem.  On the plus side, it opens wide and the new hydraulic link lets you put more in.  
And in keeping the tradition I love about BMWs, the Ci comes with an impressive tool kit. 

BMW's have a trip computer option.  Does things like calculate average speed and fuel economy on the trip.  Neat, but I think this is an excess that is not useful to many drivers.

Summary
Starting around $26k, the 323's are the most affordable of current models.  The way it is equipped to sell here pushes the price into the lower 30's, making it seem expensive in comparison.  Still, that same money will put you into one of the best handling sporty cars that can still carry four adults in comfort.  

I did not choose the 323Ci when it came time to buy, I needed a larger car at the time.  Still, the 323Ci was an excellent car, the top value of its class.
