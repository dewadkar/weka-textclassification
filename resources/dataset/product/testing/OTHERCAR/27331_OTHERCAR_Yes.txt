Our pervious car was a 1998 Mustang.  When our daughter was born we needed to upgrade.  We discussed an SUV and since we both like the outside appearance of the Durango, decided to test drive it.

We hauled our daughter in her car seat out to the dealership.  We climbed in and I fell in love.  I've ridden in similarly equipped SUV's but none made me say WOW when I climbed in.  

I am 5'2&quot; and my husband is 6'3&quot;.  Room wise, the Mustang wasn't as comfortable as him and I found driving to be burdensome as I had to move the seat up so far to reach the pedals.  Not so in the Durango.  It offers maximum comfort while driving to both of us, not such an easy task.

I think the Durango is a wonderful option to a mini van.  We have ours with the third seat and it does seat seven.  I believe you can also get a front bench seat that will allow it to seat eight.  Mini van functionality without actually having to drive a mini van. Tops in my book.

Shameless plug, but I've been told that the Durango is one of only two SUV's with a two roll bars making it extra safe.

I personally love driving this vehicle.  I love driving trucks and while the Durango is a bit more posh than the trucks I'm used too, the little bit of truck handling is welcome, as far as I'm concerned.  However, if you don't like the way trucks drive, this vehicle might not be for you.

Cargo space?  With the third seat down you can't beat it.  We've taken extended road trips packed full of stuff and have never had to be selective about what we've packed.

It also seems to handle well off road, minus of course, being a bit wide for some trails.  We had a wonderful time off roading...with seven people.

I think the one thing we have that I would do without is the back seat a/c unit.  I think it's wasteful and I'd have rather had a sunroof.  However, this was the only one available with 4 wheel anti lock brakes at the dealership at the time we bought it, and the brakes were a must have.

All in all, it really is a beautiful SUV and quite functional.<br><br>
