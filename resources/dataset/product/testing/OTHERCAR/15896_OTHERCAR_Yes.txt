            I bought this car for one of my kids, and when they crashed my suv, I acquired it.  I thought it was a great, safe car for a new driver, which is why I bought it.  I don't like cars, so I was not pleased that I ended up with one.  It is almost a year later and I must confess, I love this car!  The interior is designed better than any other vehicle that I've owned, very easy to find and use instrumentation.  It is too comfortable, if possible.  The audio system sounds great.  It does go through more gasoline than I'd like, but less than my suv did.  I have had much time to trade in this car, but I've found that I don't really want to.  I was surprised to find that it handled better than expected in snow.  The only thing I hate about this car are its door handles.  They are impossible.  I've had one repaired.<br><br>
