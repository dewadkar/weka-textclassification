            In 1993 I bought my first new car.  A Chevrolet Geo Tracker.  This car cost me about $10,000, and was still going at 136,000 miles when I traded it in.  For any teenager or someone just out of college, this is a car they should definitely consider.  

The model I bought didn't have 4 wheel drive, was a manual transmission, convertible, and with air conditioning.  

I didn't have to change the brakes until 80,000 miles.  Nothing ever went wrong with the engine.  As for the clutch, it once broke at about 100,000 miles - but it was only a link that needed to be fixed (a cost of about $30).  

As a matter of fact, the only thing that ever went wrong was the air conditioning.  I later found out it was not factory installed (not Chevrolet's fault, but the fault of the dealership in Union, NJ for not telling me).  I've already written a letter to Chevrolet telling them what an exemplary car they made for such a low cost.  Now I just wanted to tell everyone else.<br><br>
