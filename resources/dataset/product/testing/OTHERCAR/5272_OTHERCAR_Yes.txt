            I bought my 1994 honda passport in 2000.  I'm very pleased with its performance and reliability.  I've not had any major problems with the car and am greatly pleased with the power it offered when I took it on a cross state camping trip through the Rockies in Utah.  It hauled a light fully filled trailer with no problems at all even up steep slopes on dirt roads.  It's capability to deal with Utah snow was extremely impressive as I had no problems with 4 wheel drive.  The only draw back I could see was the gas mileage which is quite understandable for a V6.  The cab was extremely quite with the ability to here music crisp and clear.  The only noise really noticeable was from the sunroof which would occasionally wissle at high speeds on the freeway.  Its accident safety is extremely good handling a couple of accidents with no harm to passengers and low amount to damage to vehicle.  I know this due to my previous ownership of another honda passport which was totaled in a accident and caused absolutely no harm to the passengers without to much jerk considering there isn't air bags.  I would recommend this to anybody who doesn't really have alot of money to spend on a car but still wants a good quality vehicle.
