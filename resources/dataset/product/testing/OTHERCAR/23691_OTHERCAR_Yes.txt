            My wife says it is "The funnest car in the world to drive." The Cruiser has plenty of room for my long legs and great headroom.  On an recent trip of 500 miles both adult passengers were relaxed and comfortable during the trip.  During that trip, our Cruiser was driven through sun, rain, sleet, and snow including driving over a 5600 foot pass, I was completely satisfied.  The Cruiser topped the pass at speed in fifth gear on a snow-covered road and never lost traction.  We never used the options TRAC system since we did not need it.  I highly recommend the PT Cruiser to any one who wants a vehicle that looks different, is fun to drive and has plenty of room.  The removable rear seats is a real plus when you want to haul cargo.
