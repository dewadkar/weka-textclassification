            June of 1999, I decided to find a reliable car for me and my son who was to be born the following month.  I needed something I could afford and very safe plus enough room for a carseat.  After much research, I decided on a 1999 Honda Civic.  I got to choose the color and options and the dealership found me the car I wanted within days.  Since then, I have put on 20,000 miles and had no problems at all.  The carseats fit great in it for such a small car.  The gas mileage is amazing!  I make anywhere form 30-35 mpg.  I'm very pleased with this Honda and I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a compact car. <br><br>
