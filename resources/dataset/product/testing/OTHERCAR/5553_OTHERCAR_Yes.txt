             I find it so interesting to hear all the negatives about a Suzuki Swift  I have a &quot;derivative&quot; of sorts, a Suzuki based Chevy Sprint &quot;Turbo&quot;. Now I don't see much turbo models around, as they were in ltd production 87-88. My 87 has 162k miles &amp; is a solid, reliable, well made, good handling, w/ exc acceleration car. I have spoken w/ owners of this car who have clocked 170-300+k miles, &amp; on the orig Turbo! I must ask HOW did the car do so well asa to achieve such reliability? I thought the turbo models would be more expensive to maintain, seems almost the opposite? I DID have to replace my turbo @ 128k miles,it may very well be that the previous owners did not change oil every 3k miles like I do, &amp; how the other Sprint owners, who never had to replace a turbo despite the miles, have also done. Has the quality fell on Suzukis &quot;newer&quot; cars?
  The only down side is, some parts for the turbo model are becoming increasingly more difficult to get. Chevrolet has been discontinuing production of a lot of parts. Too bad, as I would gladly put on another 100+k miles! I have had to search for 2 mos (!) for a gasket in my turbo that went bad. I t was only $19, but 2 mos to locate one? Funny thing is that Chevrolet can sell you a hole turbo for almost a grand, as well as a new motor, but the &quot;surrounding&quot; parts are going obsolete? 
  If the newer cars had a good rep, &amp; may prove to hold up as well as mine has, I would consider purchasing a high performance Swift, if they made one that is. I have owned this car since 92, &amp; aside from buying the new turbo @ $670 through a private turbo company, I have had to get a waterpump,reman distributor, &amp; normal maint such as tuneups, struts,&amp; brakes. Neat little car that strikes up conversation w/ whomever owns one, or has owned one (&amp; regrets selling it).<br><br>
