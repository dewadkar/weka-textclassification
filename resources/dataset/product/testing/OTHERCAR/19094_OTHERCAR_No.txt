            I am a previous owner of a Kia Sportage and it honestly was the biggest financial mistake I have ever made. I want to warn you all &quot;buyers beware!!&quot;. I owned a 1997 Kia Sportage and finally had the pleasure of recently trading it in for a reliable vehicle (Toyota). 

From the beginning my Sportage was a disaster. Within the first month of owning the vehicle I had the check engine light come on and it was in the shop. From then on it was one thing after another. I had a literal stack of work reports for one thing or another. You name it, it probably went bad in my car. In three years I must have gone through about 10 different rental cars because my Kia was always in the shop. 

In the first year of owning the Sportage, the rear differential was replaced. During my second year of ownership the transmission had to be replaced. Then, in the third year they had to replace my motor (In three years!!!). Isn't a car supposed to last longer than three years?? 

I tried to claim the lemon law on my vehicle only to learn that it has to be the same problem three times in a row within the first year of ownership. I tried to trade the car in but to no avail, until recently. When I finally got someone to take the piece of junk, the value had dropped so drastically that I ended up having to pay an extra $4,000 to cover the difference between the worth of the car and my payoff amount.

All I am thankful for about this vehicle is that I was smart enough to get the extended warranty. So, all I can say is don't make the same mistake that I made, don't buy Kia<br><br>
