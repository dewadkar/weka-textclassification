            The Chrysler Concorde is a good value in my opinion. My husband and I were shopping for a large family car, and looked at Ford Crown Victoria, Chevy Impala, and Buick Century.  The Concorde was the best value for the money.

I love the looks of the car, and it handles nicely.  We normally drive sports cars, and so some of the cars we test drove seemed unresponsive by comparison, but we were pleasantly surprised by the Concorde. It has sufficient pick up to be comfortable merging into traffic, although not as much pick up as an 8 cylinder, quite good for a 6. The fuel efficiency is a bonus on long trips too!

The car is very comfortable, has numerous storage area's and drink holders inside, and a HUGE trunk. It has map lights in the front and back.  Plenty of leg room, front and back as well.

My only complaint about the vehicle so far, is the fact that groceries in the HUGE trunk sometimes roll so far back that you can't reach them.  However there is a pass through from the back seat which allows you to remedy that problem.

I think anyone in the market for a large, reasonably priced family car should purchase this vehicle.<br><br>
