            We just purchased a 1999 Isuzu Rodeo LS 2WD V6 and I am well pleased! After test driving the Nissan Xterra, Jeep Cherokee, and Toyota 4Runner and comparing features and price, the Rodeo was the one that stood out as the best value. 
 
It offers a great engine (3.2L 205hp) which outdoes the Nissan Pathfinder and Xterra (170hp), Jeep Cherokee (190 hp), Ford Explorer and Mitsubishi Montero Sport (173hp) and the Toyota 4Runner (183hp). 

The smooth drive of the Rodeo was also a pleasant surprise. I'm used to driving an automatic luxury car so I was a bit nervous about getting behind the wheel of the Rodeo but when I did, I was surprised. The Rodeo had a tight feel to the wheel with no sloppiness like some trucks do; smooth driving; no road noise even at highway speeds (like the older models had); and easy to drive! The Rodeo is also a sharp looking SUV for its class and out does its competition, the Xterra not only in performance but in looks as well. 

There is plenty of leg room in the back for three, unlike a Jeep Cherokee I recently sat in. The cargo space is also great in the back and comes with a cargo cover so that you can hide what is in your cargo or keep your groceries shaded until you get home.  The cargo space is 81.1 cu ft compared to its competitor, the Xterra which is only 65.6 cu ft. The Rodeo also has a 21.1 gallon fuel tank which means less trips to the gas station ... another great feature for someone like me who hates to fill the gas tank frequently and with its 18 city/22 hwy mph ... can't complain.

And if you happen to be one of those &quot;cell phone drivers&quot;, then the Rodeo comes standards with two power accessory outlets.

The Rodeos also come with a great warranty ...  We got a 56 month/50,000 &quot;bumper to bumper&quot; warranty on our Rodeo and a 60,000 mile road side assistance service which is really great especially for someone who doesn't ever want to change a tire on a SUV ... like me! Our Isuzu dealer also gave us an anti-theft warranty which guarantees that if our Rodeo is ever stolen, that they will recover it in three days or pay us $3,000 on top of the insurance reimbursement. I understand that the 2000 Rodeos come with a 100,000 warranty so they obviously stand by their vehicles!

I have to also mention that the Irving Isuzu Dealership where we purchased our Rodeo was the most honest and friendliest dealership we've ever been to.

Cons? The only cons I have noticed so far are the cup holders and visors. There is only one cup holder in the front which doesn't make sense. The two cup holders in the back are made with cheap, thin plastic but are 
&quot;hidden&quot; when closed. I don't plan on showing my kids where this is so it will stay in one piece. Also, the visors are cheap and flimsy looking. Isuzu could have put a little extra money into these interior features.

Of course, we can't complain about these interior features after the price we got. We just purchased the 1999 model, brand new with 50 miles on it, and many options and because its last year's model, we got in on Isuzu's 25% of MSRP promo. Great deal and that was our other reason for leaning towards the Rodeo besides its good performance and great looks!
