            We all know that film's days are numbered. The question is when, exactly, can we pronounce it dead. For me, the answer may well be when I got this camera, the DSC-P1, as a birthday present a week ago.

I'm a photography nut, or rather a &quot;snapshot&quot; nut. I take a lot of pictures, and like them to be high quality. But I could never be burdened carrying around a professional camera, a bag full of lenses, and a tripod (even though I do appreciate the results you can get with professional equipment).

To me, availability was the most important thing about a camera. If you can't have the camera with you at all times, it doesn't matter how good it is. I wanted something I could shove in my pocket, if possible. So lately, I've been using the Nikon Nuvus and the Canon Elph cameras, two very tiny APS Film cameras that are smaller than the DSC-P1.

Though this was a gift, I knew which model I was likely to get because we went camera shopping together some week's prior. There were two models I was interested in: the 2.2 Megapixel Canon Digital Elph, and this 3.3 Megapixel Sony DSC-P1. Though it would have been nice to get something Elph sized, this camera is still small enough to easily fit in any coat or jacket pocket, and can fit in a pants pocket if you're wearing baggy jeans.

I used to shoot APS film and scan it in with a film scanner. The resolution I'd get was 2900 x 1,776 pixels, but I'd seldom use all that. Typically, they'd be reduced to three sizes: thumbnails at 300x200 or so, intermediate at 800x600 and &quot;full size&quot; at 1280x1024. I'd put my photos on a web page and then on CD-ROM for archival storage.

The max resolution of the Sony is 2048x1536 which is considerably less than the film scanner. While it doesn't matter at all for the Web resolutions, I was concerned that I wouldn't be able to get a good print our of it. It turns out my concerns were unfounded--at least at the 8x10 picture sizes.

I printed out several dozen 8x10 photos from the Sony DSC-P1 on a Epson Stylus Photo 750 on the (expensive) glossy film, and on a professional Kodak dye-sublimation printer, and was quite impressed. I tried to set up similar situations from photos I had on APS film, and I was hard pressed to say which image had better quality (though there were some differences--film still seems to have the edge on dynamic range.)

All in all, I'm prepared to go all digital now. I'm going to see how long I can stand going without film. I have a little concern over the permanence--will I be able to read CD-ROMs 50 years from now, the way I can read 50-100 year old photo negatives today?

Now for specifics about the camera:

The DSC-P1 is very small, measuring 4.25 x 1.5 x 2.25 inches. Of the cameras I've seen only the Elph is smaller. The battery lasts a long time and is rechargable. (My old Kodak DC-210 ate AA batteries!) If you have a Sony Digital Cam-Corder, like a PC-1 or PC-100, you'll be pleased to know you can use the same batteries between them.

Memory is on a Sony Memory Stick. Sony includes a rather useless 8MB stick, which holds about 5 images on the highest resolution (but many more, about 60-80 on the lowest). You'll want to get 1 or 2 64MB memory sticks, to hold about 40 photos at full-res. One nice thing is Sony lets you resize the images in the camera. You can shoot an afternoon at full-res, and then de-res the ones you don't like to make room for more.

If you don't have a Memory Stick socket on your PC (some Sony PCs do), you can transfer the images via USB. I've found that this works extremely well. You plug it in to your USB port with the included cable, and Windows (I use Windows 2000) thinks you've got a new disk drive attached. You can copy the photos off to your main disk, or open them with your favorite photo editor, etc. In fact, I've yet to use any of the bundled photo software--I just plug the camera in and edit away with Adobe Photoshop.

There are some other fun features--it will take short MPEG movies with sound! It's like a moving snapshot. You can have yourself standing in front of Sleeping Beauty's castle at Walt Disney World waving and saying hello! Another mode makes animated GIFs from several still frames; Sony calls this Clip Motion.

All file formats are standard. Images are JPG, movies are MPEG or .GIF. No special view software is required.

The camera has a 3:1 optical zoom, and will do a 6:1 digital zoom. You don't get more resolution on the digital zoom, it just electronically blows up the image. You can turn digital zoom off if you want.

The menus are great. A small, but clear LCD on the back lets you see images or change camera settings. I only had to glance at the manual a couple of times in order to figure out how to use a certain feature. For the most part, you just point and shoot. 

I didn't come with a case; I would have liked one. There's one available, but I've been unable to get through to Sony to order it (the number is always busy) and Sony's website for ordering accessories doesn't work! I get page not found errors.

I've only taken several dozen photos around the neighborhood--I can hardly wait for next week when I go to Disneyland, California to give this camera a run for its money. I especially want to see if I can photograph fireworks well with it; in the past I've only been able to get good results on film.
