            Bought a Blazer that was about 2 years old (40k miles) and recently traded &quot;up&quot; for a Subaru Outback (traded at 89k miles).  This vehicle was the worst that I've ever owned.  I've owned Hondas, Fords, and an Eagle.  First of all, about 4 weeks after I drove it home, a suspension mount that was connected via a piece of rubber came apart and had to be replaced.  I had the truck for 3 years and replaced the following: upper intake manifold gasket, EGR valve, fuel pump, 4WD transfer case control module, some part of the suspension (can't remember what it was) to keep an alignment, CD player (factory one died), shocks at only 60k miles, 3 sets of front pads (over 60k miles!), etc.

Truck started to rust when it was about 4 years old under the doors and around the gas filler.  Clear coat began to peel off and pieces the molding fell off and had to be siliconed back in place.  The clear coat on the alloy wheels also peeled off and the aluminum began to oxidize.  Interior rattled and pieces came loose monthly.

The engine was adequate but the the thing became a dog with 4wd engaged.  Handling and braking were both atrocious and the ABS system is one of the worst I've experience.  The lights would quite literally dim when the ABS became engaged!!! My 4wd system died when the vehicle was about 4 or 5 years old and it took a $700 part to get it working again.  That item should have been recalled, IMHO, just because of the reason that it failed.

I could go on and on.  Let's just say that I'd rather walk or ride my bike than buy another vehicle manufactured by GM.  This company is the epitome of what is wrong with the American auto industry that is being held hostage by the UAW.<br>
