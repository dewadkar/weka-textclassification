            Hi Guys,

This is my 2nd opinion about the S-Class. Actually till now I used to think that this car was just like anyother luxury car &amp; was really cool &amp; was worth to be a part of my dream garage.

Well this car was recently launched in India with an intial lot of 100 cars to be rpoduced in this year. As Mercedes Benz India Ltd. was not able to acheive what it expected in India that is the reason it deceided to launch only 100 cars for 2000 &amp; then deceide the production scale for 2001.

I was completely thrilled to know what all it has as standard equipment. This is just a Superb Luxury car. This has everything which you can think of or want in your car. That is the reason that the car was completely booked with 2 days of its formal launching in India. That is Mercedes benz had 200 orders in 2 days for the car which they deceided would be produced on a scale of 100 for this year.

Altough I am not in the position to buy a S-Class but defenately i have the money to spare I would defenately go for it &amp; give it more weightage than the BMW 7 Series or the Lexus LS 400.

But I feel that the earlier Mercedes S-Class models were much better to look at as they looked really royal &amp; not merely sporty. This model looks a lot of a Sports Car than a Luxury Car, I personally feel that it would have been much better if the car would have been like the earlier ones, But Still this is very cool &amp; if you can afford it then what are you waiting for it is just the Best go for it.....

Bye
