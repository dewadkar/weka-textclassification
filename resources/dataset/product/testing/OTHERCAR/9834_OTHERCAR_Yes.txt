            For the money, it is a very hard if not impossible car to beat. I have driven one for 26,000 miles in 7 months and found the car and company service to be everything they advertised and more. Service in Sacramento has been outstanding and free new car loaners are hard to beat. The car has out performed the several new Fords,Dodges and a couple of GMs I have owned in the last 20 years. All steel construction including spare tire cover and the thickest body steel I have seen makes this a tough car. Excellent stereo, air conditioning, and heating systems. All options on American cars come standard on these with the exception of leather seats and moon roof. An extra $500 dollars each for those. One price shopping is nice. Components come from the top companies from around the world and standard four wheel disc brakes are hard to beat. 
Driving the car is fun even in a station wagon. Plenty of power in the mountains, takes high speed curves very well, and 80 MPH feels like 30 MPH. I have had no trouble keeping up with other cars in all sorts of conditions. I chose a standard because I found the automatic to be a weak point from a performance standpoint and for me personally, I would stiffen the suspension a little for performance drivers or at least offer that as an option.Right now it is as good as any found on the market today. But once people start really driving these cars for more than grocery shopping they are going to become addicted to the sports car feel seek more performance even though they are getting more than they paid for to start with. I am well satisfied with mine and with the top excellence throughout. I am going to be the first person down to see the new four wheel utility vehicle coming our next year powered by Mercedes running gear from Daewoo. A world class car has come to America and it is not a Ford, GM, or Dodge. America is finally getting a bargain in a car.          <br><br>
