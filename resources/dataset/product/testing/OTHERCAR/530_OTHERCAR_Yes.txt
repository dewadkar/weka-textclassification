            I purchased the C-2100 as a Christmas present for my husband. We had previously owned an Olympus D-360 but had decided it was time to upgrade. We had done the research and determined that the expense of upgrading to something higher then 2.1 megapixel wasn't justifiable for our use, which is primarily web based pictures, with occasional printing/processing. 

The Olympus-2100 UZ caught our eye and we haven't looked back since. While the C-700 is almost comparable one of the main features of the 2100, the image stabilization even at full zoom, won. We purchased the camera the first week of December.

The UZ takes amazing shots, in both light and dark situations. Sunrises, sunsets, Christmas lights, still lifes, even a full moon have all been caught on smart media card. We took the camera to Gatlinburg, TN on vacation and took some beautiful shots of the Christmas lights that were turned on at dusk. I have never seen a camera perform so well with night shots, and this is definately another plus in my book.

Another feature that I greatly enjoy is ability to change how you "shoot" your picture. From point and shoot to aperture/shutter manual settings to fully manual. You can go from having no control and leaving the camera do all of the work to fine tuning the settings to get exactly what you want to immortalize in digital format.

The camera has a standard 49mm lens, making the addition of filters a breeze. Immediately we bought an UV filter for it to protect the glass lens, outside of that we have been able to use any filter we throw at it to get amazing results, and star filters used when shooting Christmas lights just make an absolutely fairy tale ending.
