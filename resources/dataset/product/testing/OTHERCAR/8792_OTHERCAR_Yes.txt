            Before a recent road trip to Montreal, it became apparent that our whole group would not be able to fit in my Honda CRX or my girlfriend's Civic.  So we jokingly asked her father to borrow his 2000 Accord EX.  Much to our surprise, he agreed, and we drove it to Montreal.  He's lucky he got it back.

My first reaction when he pulled into my driveway was relief when I realized that they fixed the ugly rear brakelights from '98 or '99 (sorry, I don't remember).  The car is quite attractive, and there isn't anything I would change on the outside.  

Her father opted for the full leather interior, and while I'm not a fan of leather, the seats were quite comfortable and didn't become uncomfortable during the five hour trip.  They don't add much side support, however, and can get slippery depending on what you're wearing.  I found myself slipping down the seat at times.

The car we drove had an automatic transmission, and while I was upset at first that I wouldn't get to rip on the 5-speed, I was soon put in my place.  The engine was powerfully potent, and made me forget about my 5-speed desires.  Plainly put:  this car can fly.  Whether from a standstill or already cruising on the highway, the car had a good amount of pickup and kept up with cars known for their speed.  Oh yeah, did I mention it was a four door sedan?  You can imagine the looks on people's faces when they are blown past by a family sedan.

The ride quality is like none I have ever experienced.  It was as if we were on a cloud.  In dry weather the car corners like a champ, and in the rain, slush, and snow inevitable in Montreal the Accord held its ground and remained stable at all times, even if I was nervous as hell (it <b>was</b> my girlfriend's father's car, mind you).  

Another factor that should be introduced is Honda's  classic reliability.  I feel that this shouldn't be overlooked.  Most Hondas today are quite old, and it is not rare to see a Honda with 100,000 or more miles running like the day it was born.<br><br>
