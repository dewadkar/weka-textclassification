             I've owned several new cars in my time and they've all had their little quirks (let's call it character), until this one, a 1999 Nissan Maxima. It does everything so well and with such ease that it seems devoid of personality. In a way that's a good thing, because it gives you a sense of security in that it makes it feel so reliable. When I was shopping last year for a new car, I put down on a sheet of paper, what cars I liked. The Maxima wasn't on it at first, not until I found out that I could get a five speed with all the options. It stayed on the list as most of the others (who didn't offer this combination) got crossed off. Now I was down to a few cars, and I test drove them. I liked them all, so that wasn't going to be the deciding factor. The Maxima had a 2000 dollar rebate and the others didn't (the new 2000 model was due out in a few months and the dealers were making good deals on the 1999 models). So basically, I was able to get the best deal on it. Now that i've had it for a while, I can tell you that i'm very happy with it. It has enough power (I came from an AWD Turbo Eagle Talon), is cheaper on insurance than the last car I had (probably due to the 4 doors), is quiet (unlike the Talon), reliable, reasonably fun to drive, soaks up the potholes pretty well, and has plenty of room inside. The Bose sound system acquits itself rather well considering that it lacks a subwoofer. To be a little nitpicky, being a bodybuilder, when i'm in contest shape and my bodyfat is extremely low, I can feel the tiniest bump in a seat and I could feel it here. I felt a ridge in the middle of the drivers seat cushion, right where the seam is. Normally I or anyone else wouldn't notice this, but it is there and seemed incongruous in a luxury car. The exterior can best be described as subdued. It really just blends in, until you start the engine.<br><br>
