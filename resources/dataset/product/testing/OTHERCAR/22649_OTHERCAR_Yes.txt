            This is my second TDI, the first was a '98. I drive about 100,000 km (60,000 miles) per year and lease the vehicle. The difference in the body styles from my point of view is amazing. I rarely carry passengers so the tighter rear seats of the new model are not an issue. 

The '98 averaged 5.4 l/ 100 km ( 52 miles/ Imp. gal., 43.5 mpg). The '00 with the new turbo/ wastegate and controller is averaging 4.7 l/ 100 km (61.4 miles/ Imp. gal., 51.1 mpg). The new turbo and engine management system has significantly lowered cabin noise in line with the new body (Type 4).

The dash lamp colours took a little getting used to but I like it now. My only wish is that I be able to turn off the lamps at night. The lowest dimmed setting is still brighter than I would prefer for open road driving.

The cold weather package (heated outside mirrors and seats plus cold weather protection of the battery) is a recommended option. Especially if your significant other discovers the benefits to their derriere on a cold morning :)

Maintenance has been no problem as VW covers the first 40,000 km (25,000 miles). Now that VW includes synthetic oil in the crank case as well as semi synthetic in the transmission, cold starting is less of a problem. After sitting for a week at       -20C (-1F) the 'glow plug' light went out after a minute and ran quite well. Typically smoking but only for a few minutes. Diesel clatter subsided after 10 minutes or so.

However the old engine required an expensive timing belt replacement at 96,000 km (~60,000 miles). Approximately $800 Cdn ( $530 US) The new engine requires this service every 60,000 km (~37,000 mile); virtually doubling this cost. Now that my engine is broken in and VW is no longer paying for the service I switched to Amsoil Heavy Duty Diesel Synthetic 5W-30. VW does not share it's filter information so I must rely on them for the oil filter. As well I have switched to the Amsoil permanent oiled air filter. ( Higher airflow characteristics than even K&amp;N and cheaper than K&amp;N by half). Also I treated the engine and transmission to the Microlon system like I used on my airplane. I feel that by reducing internal friction and increasing breathing I will see lower rpm at speed, cooler engine temperatures and increased fuel economy. Time and my driving log will see.

One interesting tidbit is that my automobile insurance went down compared to my '98. The only reason the insurance company came up with is due to the extensive active and passive safety devices in the Type 4, I am less likely to be severely injured in an accident thereby lowering the insurance company's exposure. Very cool.

The driving is typically European and as such I enjoy the connected feeling versus North American vehicles. The ride is comfortable and quiet enough for me to listen to my 6 pack CD changer comfortably. I have gone as far as 1300 km (800 miles) in one complete tank so it has incredible legs. The biggest trick is to learn how to fill the tank completely by topping of the tank with a slow flow while you use the nozzle to hold open the 'burp' button located on the left side of the filler neck. This keeps the air purging from the tank and often lets you add a significant amount of fuel after the automatic clicks off.

Overall I can hardly wait for VW to send us the Passat TDI finally. I will never go back to a gas engine and I will be hard pressed to leave VW. The added cost for the diesel versus the gas engine is quickly offset by the fuel savings based on the economy, fuel price and the distance I drive. <br><br>
