            We are leasing a 1999 Suburban which is loaded with leather seats, cd/cassette player, heated/electric front seats &amp; mirrors, and LOTS of room.  We have five children ages 10, 8, 5, 2, &amp; 1, which is the reason we have this vehicle.  The ONLY thing I dislike about the Suburban is that with the doors closed, it is very difficult to work the controls to adjust the front seats.  There is hardly any room for your hand between the door and the seat.  Otherwise, it is a dream to drive.  It does not drive like a truck or a van but like a big car.  Very smooth ride and takes curves smoothly at faster speeds than my husband's GMC Sonoma.  It is not top-heavy at all.  It is a must-have for large families!!  It seats 8 or you can special order one with a front bench seat to seat 9.  Gas mileage is not very good and the tank holds 42 gallons of gas.  This is not for the environmentalist!<br><br>
