            In 1998, my mother purchased an LX450 for all the wrong reasons.  She bought it thinking (mistakenly) that it would be a great car to take offroad for camping, and a good all-around car for driving.  Not only does she not really need any rough and tough control, but the car fails in even the most meager of driving tests.  Comfort-wise, it leaves much to be desired.  At the same time, it rides &quot;funny&quot;, and you never quite feel like the car has reached a state of equilibrium.  Perhaps its just my nitpicking, but I always give her a hard time about the car, mainly because I hate it as much as I do, and she loves it as much as she does.

PROS
----

Large
--The LX450 does have a lot of space.  With the two farthest back seats up, there is plenty of room for most of your hauling jobs.  Of course, its a Lexus, so why would you want to?

Sits up high
--This is a blessing and a curse, the latter of which I'll address in a minute.  On the upside, it does sit up pretty high for the size of SUV it is.


CONS
----

Funky Suspension
--The suspension is constantly causing the car to rock back and forth.  You never have complete control over the car, because the slightest wheel adjustments leave the car rocking, necessitating more wheel adjustments.  Its a nasty cycle, that I'd rather just avoid.

Poor Handling
--With the height of the car, and the weird suspension, the car does not handle safely, or well.  You constantly have to worry about flipping, and turns are always jerky.  The steering snaps back far too quickly, meaning that if you let go of the wheel in a turn, you'll come out of it fast and hard, far more so than on any other vehicle.

Large Price Tag
--This thing is, in all honesty, just a LandCruiser + $15000.  In my opinion, if you found something you liked about this car, and actually use it for its intended purpose as an SUV, just go with the LandCruiser.


OVERALL
-------

To say I dislike driving this car would be an understatement.  It just makes me mad that my mother spent this much money on a car.  It astounds me that Toyota, a company that makes such a wonderful SUV as the 4Runner could create such a horrible vehicle as the LX450.  Don't buy it, there really is no reason to.<br><br>
