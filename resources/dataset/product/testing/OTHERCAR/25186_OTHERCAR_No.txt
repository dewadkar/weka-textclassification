            I bought the Protege after seeing it highly touted in a number of automobile magazines.  I have been satisfied by the car's driving performance and comfort, but the quality is lack luster.  

The first problem is noise.  This car's engine whines like a go-kart pleading for you to shift into a higher gear when you accelerate.  Also I have noticed some significant wind noise when travelling at speeds over 55 miles per hour.

I also am not overly enthusiastic about the layout of the gauges in the dash.  The big, simple dials are easy to read and are idiot-proof during the day.  At night, however, trying to read the dials is like trying to translate hieroglyphics without the Rosetta Stone.  The lighting of the gauges is very poor even when turned to it's highest level of &quot;brightness&quot;.

My main beef with the craftmanship and quality of this auto mobile is the plastic piece inside the door lock that is depressed when the key is inserted into the keyhole.  Three months after buying the car the plastic piece in the driver's side door lock broke, so I was forced to climb into my car from the passenger's side.  While this can certainly make you feel like a loser on a date and moron in the work parking  lot, it is especially annoying because you buy a new car so that you don't have to do those things.

After one month of having the driver's side door lock repaired with a metal piece, the plastic piece in the passenger's side broke.  I nearly had to have the whole door replaced because I wanted to kick the thing in frustration.  I would recommend discussing this issue with your dealer before purchasing this vehicle. <br><br>
