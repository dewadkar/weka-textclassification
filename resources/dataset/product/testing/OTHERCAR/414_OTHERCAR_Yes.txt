            I bought a 1996 ES 300 pre-owned about a year and a half ago because my wife and I just had a baby, so I needed a 4 door sedan.  I purchased the car based on the appearance, exclusiveness, and reputation.  I was able to find a '96 with only 14,000 miles on it.  

In the time that I've owned the car, I've never experienced any type of problems whatsoever.  The car seems very dependable and will likely last for many years to come.  

I do like the car very much.  It is extremely quiet inside and out.  Even under hard acceleration, the engine is extremely quiet and smooth.  Wind and road noise inside the cabin is almost nonexistent.  The ride is smooth, and handling is good.  The car strikes a good balance between handling and ride compliance.  The one thing that I dislike about the car is the lack of feel and response to the road.  I like to drive, and don't particularly like to feel totally isolated from the road.  My BMW 328i strikes a better balance between ride quality and road feel than this car does.   The car almost totally isolates you from the road, which can be good or bad depending on how you like to drive.  For example, my wife loves the feel of the Lexus because she likes the feeling of isolation from the road.   I prefer more of a driving &quot;feel&quot;.  Also, the standard 15&quot; wheels look a little out of place on a luxury car.  They are too small for a car of that size.  I replaced mine with 16&quot; aftermarket wheels that give the car a much more elegant look.     

Overall, the car has been great.  Decent acceleration, good handling, and as quiet as a monestary.  The styling is somewhat sporty and very classy.  Very comfortable to live with everyday.  I would recommend this car to all but the most spirited of drivers.
