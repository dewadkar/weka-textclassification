            I bought a '94 1500 SLT with the 5.9 brand new.  I still have it...with 180,000 miles.  Everything with the truck has been great...BUT...if you buy one get the transmision cooler option.  When my transmission went on me there were three other 1500 Dodge trucks in the shop.  Their transmissions are junk.  They all go around 36-40K miles...conveniently out of warranty.

Whatever you do, don't put a lot of money into the stereo.  The speakers they use are horrible.  They had to be replaced four times before we realized they were getting wet and sounding horrible.  The seatbelt and drivers side seat have an annoying squeak, and something in the dash has been rattling around since I had 10K miles on it.

The dealer was o.k. with problems, but Dodge was not the best to deal with on problems.  They have a tendency to replace warranty items (speakers) but charge you for the parts and labor (the clips that hold the door panels on).

Overall I have been somewhat satisfied with the truck.  How can anyone complain about 180K miles on the same truck?<br><br>
