            I bought a 2001 Corolla LE in August 2000 and have put on about 50,000 miles.  I originally owned an '83 Tercel that taught me the virtues of a long-lasting simple automobile.  I drove cross-country six times in the "Yoter" and only had to change a fuel pump and some warped rotors along the way -- but those happened well after the car had 100,000 miles.

OK, back to the Corolla.  After living in Baltimore for a couple of years, the exterior has an interesting assortment of dings, dents, and scratches, but the interior is pure gold.  No problems with any mechanical or electrical system, everything works just like the day I bought it.

Fuel economy is excellent, and I'm the type of person who calculates it religiously -- I have a 5-speed and I usually average 38-39 mpg with mostly highway driving.  If I do more in-town driving, that might drop to about 36 mpg.  

Performance is fair to middling -- acceleration is slow in first gear, second is better, and third has some muscle.  The clutch is not too forgiving and takes some practice, and the hair-trigger accelerator doesn't help matters much.  I've done some severe weather driving and the car is sure-footed in snow and rain -- front-wheel drive and the manual transmission do the trick.  Braking is OK but requires more force on the pedal than one might be used to, especially in an emergency situation.  Handling is fairly tight but the car's cheap suspension and 14 inch wheels show up on bumpy terrain.  Despite occasional discomfort the suspension appears to be hardy, having dealt with Baltimore's awful streets without any repairs to date, and a high speed impact with a rock on the highway didn't cause any damage beyond a tire.

Let's talk about size for a moment.  I'm 6 foot 5 inches tall, and I'm at my limit in terms of interior space, and forget it for the person in the back seat behind me.  But the weird thing is I've sat in a lot of so-called bigger cars and they're all worse!  Even the new Cadillacs!  One notable exception is the Volkswagen Golf, which has a great front seat and lots of legroom.  The Corolla has pretty generous head room but the leg room is tight.  I recommend cruise control so at least you can move around a little on longer trips.

Interior ergonomics are efficient and to the point.  Controls and displays are easy to use and designed to last.  The cruise control has a great feature where you can push the lever up to go 1 mph faster or down to go 1 mph slower.  I also like the automatic headlights -- you never have to worry about turning them on or off.

Good design extends to the engine compartment.  All the fluids are very easy to check and refill if necessary.  The air filter and lightbulbs are easy to change too.  The engine itself is all aluminum and you don't see the usual copious amount of plastic.  There's a generous space between the bumper and the engine, which would save lots of dough in a front-end crash.

In this age of monster SUVs, the issue is going to be "is it too small."  But let me point out the benefits -- tight turning circle, getting into those parking spots nobody else can, and the ability to weave through city traffic.  The Corolla has a big trunk, no problem packing up for a two week vacation.  And on smooth roads you can pretend you're in a much bigger car.  Another advantage of small is affordability -- I paid 15 grand including taxes and tags, a pretty good deal considering how long I expect the car to last.

Based on my past experience with the Tercel, 200,000 miles is a reasonable lifetime for the Corolla, and the repairs I expect to make are new brakes ($300) and tires ($350) around 75K miles (and again at 150K), and possibly a new alternator ($300), starter ($300), struts ($300), and waterpump ($300) around 100-150K miles.  OK, maybe the fuel pump ($200) at some point too.  The exhaust systems and AC last forever on the Corolla, according to Consumer Reports surveys.  The key is that these items are easy to identify when they break and don't rack up the bill for labor.

By the way, these prices assume that you never, never take your car to the dealer, which is the ultimate no-no if you want to save money on car repairs.  With the Corolla, you can gleefully ignore the recommended servicing (just have your local mechanic check things when you go in for an oil change).  Look for that gas station/repair shop with a guy named Chip, Mike, Steve, or Joe, that'll be your place.

The Corolla is a car for people that want to (or have to) drive in an urban/suburban environment without worrying about things breaking, and save lots of money along the way.  This is the car that will take a licking and keep on ticking, but it's still a big step up from my old no-AC, AM radio Yoter, which I affectionately called "the lawnmower with wheels."
