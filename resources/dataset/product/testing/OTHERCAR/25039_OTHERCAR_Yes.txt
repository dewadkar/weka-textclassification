            Two years ago my wife needed a new car. In our search we found a 1995 LHS
that fit the bill. It had been used as an airport limo and had just slightly over 30,000 miles on it. It needed a few things done to it initially. Overall it has been a great car. Very roomy, comfortable for 6 adults on a long journey. Plenty of trunk space. My wife uses it for her business and sometimes will take a client to an upscale showroom for products she designs and sells. No complaints from any of them, and they drive much more expensive vehicles. It has had to have little more than normal maintainence. It has been very reliable. My only complaint is that the transmission fluid needs to be topped off occasionally. It is a very peppy and predictable vehicle. I really like the full sized spare with mag rim just like the other 4 on it. In my dealings with the big 3 US car manufacturers, I have found Chrysler Corp to be the most responsive about fixing problems with their products.
