            Ok,ok  my mother bought this for me.  My mother thought it was a &quot;great&quot; deal for only 30 bucks, boy was she wrong.  After putting in batteries I went to take some pictures. I had to find something to take a picture of so I took pictures of my cat. :)   I then downloaded them to see what I got.  Man, I did not like what I saw. Grainy pictures, out of focus, and in reality if I did not know that they were pictures of my cat I would have had a hard time telling what they were.  So I thought it was the software that came with it, I &quot;borrowed&quot; better software and they were still a mess. Only now I can clean them up better. (and make the cat look like a cat) Plus downloading kills the battery<br><br>
