            My husband thinks the reason I ended up buying an Amigo was because my he liked it and he thought I would really enjoy driving it.

The real reason is because I have (4) grandchildren ranging in ages from three at the time of purchase to seven years old.  Which means they varied widely in height.  The back seat can sit three very comfortably without any little feet kicking the back of the driver seat, which I hate.  It is a very sporty car which I have found that men as well as women like the looks of.  The gas mileage in the city as well as the highway is above average.  I can drive 300 miles on a tank of gas, which I think is great.  When I put the back down all I have to do is take the two back windows out, flip two levers and pull the back down.  It is so easy I can have it down within two minutes.  The Amigo has a role bar which I like due to the fact of driving my grandchildren around with the top down and the vehicle having a partial soft top I have less worries if I was to get into a wreck.  

I have always wanted a truck but with children and then grandchildren a truck was really out of the question.  I don't like to drive a vehicle which is real long like the extended cab trucks so with buying the Amigo I got as close as I could to getting me my truck. 

I also get to feel like a teen again driving my Amigo.  It is safe and very reliable.  The only thing I don't like about my Amigo was when my daughter, mother and I went on a trip.  My mother, being over 70 years old needed to sit in the front seat since it is a two door vehicle.  That left the back seat for my daughter.  She had a very comfortable ride all the way to Texas, but when we got to the Resort we were going to stay at she was trying to get out of the back seat, and miss judged the distance from the vehicle to the pavement.  She fell out of the car, broke her ankle in two places and ended up with pins in her ankle.  I felt really bad since it was my car.  But on the way back we folded the back seat down and there was plenty of room for her, the luggage and her &quot;new&quot; cast.<br><br>
