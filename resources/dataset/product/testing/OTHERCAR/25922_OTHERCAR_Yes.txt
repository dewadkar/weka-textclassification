             After careful research of all cars in the Grand Am's price range, including Chevy Malibu/Caviler, Olds Alero, Ford Taurus, ect.... I found that you get more &quot;bang for your buck&quot; out of the Pontiac Grand Am. At $19,000(after a little dealing) you can't beat the option package.

 I love the 175HP engine matched perfectly with a 4spd+OD transmission gives the car great pick up when merging on to 70MPH freeways or passing that big rig. The engine and exhaust have an aggressive tone under heavy throttle that sounds great but may annoy some older people. The car also gets great gas mileage for it's size and 6cyl eng.. we are getting about 16mpg city and 29mpg highway(using cruise control).
 The great ground effects package on the GT makes it a pleasure to look at with 16&quot; alloy wheels and p225/50r16 GoodYear RSA all season tires not only look great they also keep the car on the road.
 The sound system is nice, CDplayer with 6 speakers and built in EQ. has great clarity and tight bass. The power package is above average, the only thing missing is the driver's seat should be full power with memory recall, rear view mirror should be light sensitive, and no lights on the vanity mirror. Pontiac covered most of the other bases as far as options go, with traction control, tire pressure sensor, oil change sensor, great AC, 4 wheel disk brakes(that stop great in the rain), and remote keyless entry. 
 Some of the cons with the Grand Am are the, digital display on the clock/radio go goofy once and a while, I had to have the fan on the AC/heat fixed(under warranty), and the door upholstery had to be fixed on the top seam. The car also tends to have a little bit of push in the front end when taking really hard corners on a level surface, but give it a little banking and it sticks like glue.

 As far as driving the vehicle, it's fun! I've taken 2 trips over 3200 miles round trip and comfort wasn't an issue, the passenger's seat could use lumbar support. The quick acceleration, stable handling, and attention to ergonomics, make this a very enjoyable driving experience.

 I would suggest this car to anyone under the age of 60 looking for a sharp looking, well handling, and reliable car in the $20,000 range.
