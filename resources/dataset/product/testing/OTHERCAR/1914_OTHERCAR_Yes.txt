            The Nissan Maxima has it's work cut out for it. It is competing in a very crowded category, Camry, Accord and Taurus are just a few that come to mind.  The Maxima is different.  The first clue is it's styling.  The Maxima looks different, especially when compared to the previously mentioned Camry and Accord. Granted I've seen some Accords that look pretty cool, but that was only after the owners spent some $$$ on wheels, tires, suspension components etc. The Maxima looks great straight off the showroom floor. In fact the styling is so different for it's class, it may be a drawback for some.

As I have mentioned before I drive a lot of cars each year. When it came time to buy a car, I chose the safe route.  I bought a Camry. As soon as I drove the 2000 Maxima, I was sorry I bought the Camry. The Camry is a great car, but it lacks the fun I found in the Maxima.

The Maxima is so much more a drivers car than many others in it's class. Sure it's no BMW 5 series, but it sure is fun to drive. Get the 5-speed, you will be surprised at how fun a 4-door can be to drive. The 222hp, 3.0L V-6 is smooth and likes to rev.  As good as the engine is, it lacks the refinement found in both the Honda and Toyota. The short throw, notchy shifter only adds to the fun. Gear changes are quick and precise. Drop the Shifter from 4th to 5th, squeeze the gas and... you just missed your exit. You won't care, too busy having fun. Handling is very good for a car this size. At times the car is downright sporty. Even in sharp turns or avoidance maneuvers, the Maxima is predictable and stable.  In SE trim the ride is slightly more harsh than others in it's class. The upside to that firm ride; no floating  feeling. Overall a very, very good engine and transmission. No complaints mechanically.

Inside the Maxima has all that you would expect for a car priced in the mid 20's. No rattles or squeaks. The dash and interior design lack the ergonomic perfection a Honda owner might expect. Nissan still struggles with little things like the cruise control on/off switch, The placement is odd. All other buttons and switches are where they should  be. The stereo controls could be a bit bigger, as could the rear window defrost button. The seats are comfortable and VERY supportive. The seats, like the rest of the car, have a decidedly sporty feel and are easy to adjust, but I found it took me an extra minute or so to find the perfect driving position. Interior room seemed only slightly less than the Accord, however I am just over 6 feet tall and my head did not touch the roof. Expect 4 adults to ride comfortably on a long trip, 5 if your trip is less than an hour.

For just over $25K you can get 4 wheel discs with ABS, driving lights, remote keyless entry, 17in wheels, rear spoiler, and all the usual power features.

This car is not for everyone, but if you want the utility of a 4-door and the sporty nature of a coupe, this is the car for you.  If you like soft and floaty, you might be out of luck. Then again why would you want soft and floaty?????<br><br>
