                     I purchased the Olympus D-340R after reading many reviews about it, now I'm writing one myself.  As others have said- this is a great camera for a great price.  It has a professional and photo-quality resolution, a 1.8-inch LCD screen and many other features essential to a great digital camera.  And it is a fraction of the price of similar camera made by other name brands.  The camera is great for everyone.  Weather your a first time photographer or first time digital camera user like me, or an experienced photographer and digital camera user, the Olympus D-340R is for you.  For 300, this baby goes along way.  The resolution is picture perfect and super detailed for making great print or web pages.  The feature I found most useful was to take, review and preview your pictures without having to upload them to your computer, which by the way is a good setup with fast transfer time.  I choose this product by the reviews and the features for the price, and I recommend any digital camera buyer to do the same.  I did find that when taking pictures with the optical viewfinder, the LCD lens got smudges on it, but that is easily repaired.  Also when you use the LCD screen frequently, the battery gets guzzled up.  Overall, the Olympus D-340R is a great camera, and with enough searching you can find it online for $250.  Thank you and I hope you like my review of this GREAT camera.  Keep some extra batteries handy though for when you go out with it.<br><br>
