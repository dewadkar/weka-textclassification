            This modified hot-rod is a GREAT car for families. The only two complaints I have concern the bad design of the inside front door handles, which will BITE you on the little finger if you aren't aware of the problem, when opening the door. (OUCH!) The second has to do with lights. I have had my 1999 V70XC for nine months, and have had to replace both low beam headlights, and one fog light socket, which melted. This may seem like a small matter, until you have to take the time on each occasion to go to the dealer and wait for the work to be done. Other than that, I love the car, which has 18,000 miles on it...been to both coasts with it, love its peppiness,and comfort, 800 mile days are a snap. Heater is great, easy to control temp and flow area. A/C is wonderful, even in the desert. Oh! One other thing I don't like is the gargantuan build-up of brake dust on the front wheels. They could reroute the air-flow, no?<br><br>
