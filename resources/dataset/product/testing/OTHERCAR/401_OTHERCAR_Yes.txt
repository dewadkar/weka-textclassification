            On 11/19/2000 while driving home from my relatives home in my brand new 2001 X Terra welcome to our family only one month ago. A drunk driver making over 90 mph hit us in a Mazda 626, by the way I fell sorry for the very dead drunk driver. the impact was so hard that the gear case came apart from the chasis and we rollover five times down hill. With all this damage to the body of the X Terra preserve her body integrity and we walked out of it with out a cut. The Police Inspectors said that if this happen in a full size car we could be all dead. My wife, my two year old , my four year old, and my self thank Nissan for such a good and well made SUV. If all of you want to see photos of my &quot;TOTAL LOSS&quot; Nissan X Terra e-mail me at ducoscastro@hotmail.com .As soon as I get my insurance money I will be back at the Nissan Dealer driving home in a new one.&quot;Gracias Nissan from Puerto Rico.&quot;  <br><br>
