            You have most likely read in all automobile magazines that the Mercedes-Benz M-Class is one of the most successful SUV's on the market.  In some ways I would have to agree with them, but mostly, I think this car is over rated.

Exterior: When the exterior looks like this, I couldn't figure out what was so great about the truck.  Sure, it looks sleek and has some appeal, but all in all, it looks downright ugly!  The back is sort of curved like a station wagon and the back window does not exactly look right.
I own a Land Rover Range Rover, and a Land Rover Discovery Series II. They both have much more exterior appeal than then the M-Class.

Engine: If you have decided to get the M-Class, you would be better off not getting the ML 320. The engine just doesn't cut it for this type of SUV. The ML 430 is your best bet.  With 288 horse power, this truck is well beyond the point it needs to be.  The only problem is it is a big fuel guzzler only getting 15 to 19 mpg.  

Interior:  The interior is the only part in my opinion, that sticks out unlike any other SUV.  The seats are incredible and are probably the most comfy chairs I have ever been in in an SUV with the exception of the Range Rover. 
- Front head room 39.8 in
- Rear head room 39.7 in
- Front leg room 40.3 in
- Rear leg room 38 in
- Front hip room 55 in
- Rear hip room 54.7 in
- Front shoulder room 58.3 in
- Rear shoulder room 57.9 in

Ride:  The ride is extremely smooth and it corners like a pro. Sometimes, parts of the interior rattle but other than that it is a dead quiet ride.
