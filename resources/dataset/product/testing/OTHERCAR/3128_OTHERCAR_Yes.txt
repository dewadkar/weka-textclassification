                   We just bought a 2000 Elantra GLS and we think it's a great car for the money we paid for it.  It runs well, gets GREAT gas mileage, and is actually roomy enough for 2 adults and 3 kids, including 2 in car seats.
       The only thing I really don't care for is the center console.  It's not really arranged quite right or something, because even though there's lots of places to put things, they're just, well, inconvenient.  
       For example, there are 3 places to put sunglasses, but they inevitably fall on the floor when you're driving.  The drink holders are only big enough for a 12 oz. soda can (so you have to use small coffee cups), and they're placed in such a way as to completely block the ashtray and cigarette lighter when in use.  
       The rest of the controls are well placed, though, and easy to use.  Except that the dash light dimmer knob IS NOT LIT!! What's up with that?!  If it's dark in the car and you want to adjust them, it's quite a trick to find the knob.  Once you know where it is, though, it's not too bad.
Even though it sounds like I'm complaining, I really do like the car.  And the warranty really is the best available.<br><br>
