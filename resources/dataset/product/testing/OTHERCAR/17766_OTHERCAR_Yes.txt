             Having owned a Saturn SL for Five years I can say that I am
a satisfied customer.
 One of the things that has impressed me the most is how that
they have produced it with a flexible material that makes it almost
dent proof. I can remember shortly after I had bought my car I 
noticed a boy getting in the car next to mine. Not only did he
slam his door into my car once,but the brat did it twice. In rage
I run to my car and inspect the damage. To my surprise I found none,
not even a scratch.
  I had serviced my car on regular basis and it is still in good
shape. I turned the mileage over about six months ago.
  I really only have one complaint on my Saturn. It does not have
enough get up and go when push down the accelerator.
  Overall I think Saturn is a well built car and I will buy another.
I hope someday they will start manufacturing trucks.
