            This camera gives seriously advanced photographic performance with unrivaled digital image quality! It has a 3x zoom Nikkor lens with 38mm to 115mm coverage(35mm equivalent), giving clear, sharp images plus 4x stepless digital zoom, and it's very impressive looking as well! It also has 256 element matrix metering and white balance, and a 4896 step multi area auto focus for quick compensation with interruption. It accepts all Coolpix lenses and accessories, and you can connect up to five speedlights with optional bracket to light up any scene. This is not for a beginner though. Make sure and read the manual completely, even if you think you know what you're doing. Downside is for those that have to get the info off the cdrom, however, if you don't have a computer, you probably wouldn't want this camera anyways! <br><br>
