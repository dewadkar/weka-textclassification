            Ok, so I bought a convertable in October in Portland Oregon.  Who would have thought?  I think the dealer thought I had lost my mind, but as luck would have it, my company transferred me to Phoenix several months later.  I currently own a 1997 Chevy Cavalier convertable, red with a black interior.  I have had this car for two years now, and have had absolutly no trouble with it at all.  It averages 22 miles per gallon in town, and almost 30 on the highway.  
The car has been extrememly reliable, with no breakdowns, errors, etc.  The sound system that came with the car was ok, but I did upgrade to a cd player.  
It's a great ride, super get up and go!  Not only that, but it looks pretty cool too!  I paid approx 16,000, and have definately gotten my moneys worth.
Good luck!
