            We recently bought a used '96 Mitsubishi Galant S.  It has tan leather interior, a cassette player and a cd player, a sun roof, and in my husband's opinion, it's best feature is the fact that it is a stick shift.  It gets wonderful gas mileage, and though it's cramped compared to a van or SUV (which is what we've been used to for the last few years), it's not that bad.  We have 2 large car seats in the back seat and our 5 year old sits back there too and he isn't at all squished.  

The only real con I can think of is the fact that even though it has a place to set your cup or can of soda, which can be hidden when not in use, if you have it out and use it to hold your drink it is very likely to interfere with the person shifting gears.  That area of the car is very cramped.  

But so far that is the only negative thing about this car.  The seats are comfortable and while there isn't a lot of leg room, it's better than the amount of leg room I've experienced in some cars of the same size (Honda Accord comes to mind).  This car is low to the ground and handles well around corners and curves and handles well on the ice and snow (something that we got to test it on this past week).   

This is an excellent car for a small family.  It is comfortable, handles well, and is economical.<br><br>
