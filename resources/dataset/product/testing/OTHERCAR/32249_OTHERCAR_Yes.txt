            Leased our RX300 with local, long-distance and cargo hauling in mind. The cargo is a 3/4-size string bass for
playing in local symphony orchestras, plus other gigs. 

The rear seats lower flush and allow easy loading and removal. Cargo tie rings allow restraining straps for things such as expensive instruments and other stuff you don't want flying about in an emergency. 

Like other Lexus products, the RX300 oozes quality in its fit and finish. We find the vehicle quite comfortable, though occasionally wish for a 6-way adjustable passenger seat, such as is on our Lexus LS 400. Ride is very smooth, since the RX300 is a car-based rather than truck based SUV. 

Power is more than adequate from the FWD 6-cylinder engine. Handling is excellent and surefooted, even in South Florida monsoons. Because of front-wheel drive, the turning circle is very wide in comparison to the LS 400 and other rear-wheel drive cars we have owned. Takes a couple of turns and backups to enter a perpendicular parking space. Parallel parking is not as difficult. 

Dealer service has been excellent so far. At nearly $40,000, we found the RX300 rather pricey compared with other comparable models but chose it for the above attributes, plus brand loyalty (this is our third Lexus).
