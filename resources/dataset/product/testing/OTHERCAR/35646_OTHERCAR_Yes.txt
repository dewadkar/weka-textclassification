            I received this camera about 2 years ago as a Christmas present and it has yet to fail me.  Yeah the MP's are a little low by today's standards but this camera still takes great pictures.  When viewing the pictures on the computer if the user zooms in too closely you will then see the pixels but printing the pictures at 50% brings out crisp details.  I carry this camera with me wherever I go and it's helped me capture some great shots.  I do recommend buying a larger capacity memory card.  The internal memory is nice but should be used as a backup when the card is full.

The software included with the camera can be loaded in a snap and is very user friendly.  The pictures are downloaded automatically when the camera is plugged in and takes only 30 seconds to bring over 30+ pics.  I've dealt with other brands and this is by far the easiest software I've ever used.

Durability is one of this cameras strong points.  Like I mentioned before this camera travels with me EVERYWHERE.  It's been left in the car in the dead of winter, the hottest days of summer and was even left out in a heavy rain overnight.  There has been no affect at all to the battery life or picture quality!  Battery wise it's pretty conservative.  My favorite setting is keeping the LCD display off until a picture is taken where it's displayed for 5 seconds.  This seems to make the batteries last damn near forever.
