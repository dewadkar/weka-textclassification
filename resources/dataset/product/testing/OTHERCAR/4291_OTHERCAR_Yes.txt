            	It's not enough for me to say that I love this car...I adore it. I am a very large woman, and for the last 13 years I squeezed into my trusty Ford Tempo, dreading the day when I would have to get another car.  Would I fit?  Would I feel like an idiot at the dealership? Could I even drive the thing?
	I had loved the look of the new Beetle and I had secretly imagined driving it, feeling like a hippy again, cruisin' along. I saw someone get into their Beetle at a parking lot nearby and I thought, hey! I can fit there! So when my beloved Tempo hit the road, literally, I stopped at the VW dealership and drove away in a brand new yellow beetle that day!
	What an amazing car.  It drives like a dream, parks anywhere, and it is the coolest thing on 4 wheels. I slide right into the car with no problem whatsoever, and I don't even have to have a seatbelt extension. The seat adjusts easily.  All the gadgets and gizmos are within easy reach and easy to understand. The roominess is incredible. Four large adults can fit in it with ease and comfort. AND, the storage/trunk space has got to be seen to be understood.  It is immense. With the back seat folded down, two people could go camping for a week and fit all their gear and a full-sized tent with no struggle at all.
	There are so many neat little things about this car.  I could tell you all about tire size or engine size or all that other stuff, but I would just have to copy it out of the owner's manual and I don't know what it means anyway. I'll just tell you the things that matter to me:
		1. The radio rocks. It's easy to program and sounds wonderful.
		2. The gas mileage is good, around 26 mpg.  Not the best, but I have an automatic, and I think that's pretty good. My brother bought a standard, and it gets 30ish, but I'm fine with 26.
		3. It has lots of cute little storage places. My favorite, besides the vase with my sunflower in it, is by the driver's window...a glasses holder.
		4. It has a remote keyless entry and locking device. That's pretty neat and has come in handy a lot.  You can be walking up to the car and press a button to open the trunk...cool!
		5. The ride and the acceleration are great. I have no problems keeping up in this car.
		6. The color is terrific, a bright yellow.  Never in a million years would I have thought to get this color, but it was the only color in automatic, so I took it and I am so happy.  I have had this car since June and I am still thrilled every time I get into it, or see it in the parking lot at work.

	So...BUY this car. And if you should pass a little yellow bug in Southern Maine, whose driver has big smile on her face, swap me the peace sign!<br><br>
