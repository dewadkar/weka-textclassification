            This is my first digital camera.  I did a lot of research about the different cameras available.  I wanted something that could be used as a "point & shoot" camera, but that also have advance features that I could use as I become more proficient in my photography skills.

I purchased mine with a 340 MB IBM Microdrive.  It will hold 245 pictures at full resolution and nearly 1000 on low resolution.  This was a big selling point for me because I know how much memory cards cost these days.  I can take a lot of pictures and not have to worry about needing new memory cards or running out of film.

The camera comes with 64 Bestshot macros for different pictures situations (i.e. sunsets, action, low-light, etc.)  Most of them see to work fairly well for a novice like me that knows squat about f-stops and the like.

This thing eats batteries for breakfast, so get 2-3 sets of rechargeable batteries.  The lack on an AC adapter is annoying, but this camera takes great pictures and has a good overall value.
