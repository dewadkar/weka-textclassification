            I've owned my 2001 325i sedan 14 months now and 19,000 fun miles and I love it.  Now I'm already planning my next BMW move.  I hope to always have at least one in my garage.  I'm hooked.  This sedan serves as my daily driver, but its small size and my 2 young growing children mean that soon I will be living in mini-van city. My plan is to ditch my mint restored '62 Buick convertible I've owned for many years and go back to driving a Honda or something as a daily driver, in order to upgrade to a '98 M3 convertible - to keep the BMW experience alive. I will keep that BMW ragtop for a long long time.  But enough about my scheme...

The 2001 325i sedan is awesome.  The sportsman in me would have liked a 5 speed, but I am very impressed with the Steptronic.  The sport mode is fully automatic, yet the shifting pattern is held to higher RPMs mimicking a manual.  As a result, you punch the gas and go.  The car growls and you playfully zoom along.  Need more hands on? Slide the shifter over a notch and you now have a 5 speed clutchless manual. Awesome engineering and worth a test drive just to see how it works.

<b>Don't bother getting the X model with all wheel drive</b>
The DSC traction control is awesome in the snow.  I live in Chicago and have gotten through some big snow storms with confidence and without problem. Save your money!

<b>Its called the premium package for a reason</b>
I made the mistake of buying a car off of the dealer's lot instead of ordering exactly what I wanted. I couldn't wait the 2 months! As a result, I took the premium package, hoping it would pay off in resale value later.  Astute buyers can get most of the options in the premium package ala carte, and save a lot of money.  Unfortunately, unless you get the premium package, you have to order from the parts department a center console arm rest.  This is really a stupid oversight for a $35,000 car.  In such small cabin quarters, a center console armrest is essential.  Why not include it?

RE comfort: for a while I was having some discomfort with the seats in that my legs fell asleep on rides of longer than an hour.  I solved the problem by "tweaking" the lumbar and tilt and now it's fine. 

Consider a 3 series and you will become hooked too!
