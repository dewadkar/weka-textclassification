            I received a silver Kodak DC215 digital Camera in April of 2001, as a birthday gift.  Before choosing this camera I did a lot of shopping around and decided that this camera was the best one in my price range.

I wanted a camera between about $200-$250.  I also was hoping to get one with a zoom lens.  I found the Kodak DC215 on sale at Staples for <b>$239</b>.  I think it was on sale because it is an older model.

<b>Some of the Features I like the most</b>

- 2x Zoom lens (and it comes with a lens cover, although it is kind of flimsy)
- A flash with red-eye reduction and I think indoor and outdoor settings, although I haven�t played with these yet.
- 1.8 inch LCD display screen which displays your pictures for about 20 seconds after you have taken them, so you can just delete them right away if it came out bad.
- 1152x864 pixel resolution at the highest setting.
- Automatic Timer
- Can be hooked up to the TV to capture screen shots (I haven�t tried this out yet)

<b>Features I dislike</b>

- It comes with a serial cable, whereas most of the other cameras in this price range have USB connections, which transfer pictures quicker.
- It only comes with a 4 mb memory card.  Of all the competing cameras, which I looked at, this seems to be average, for the price range.  Some only came with 2 mbs and others with 8mb.  At the highest quality settings this card holds about 12 pictures.
- Eats batteries.  (runs on 4 AA�s.)

<b>Software</b>

- The camera comes with ArcSoft Photo Impressions 2000.  I installed it and used it once, and it was pretty easy to use, but I prefer my Photo program, which I am used to.

<b>Sample Pictures</b>

These are pictures that I took with the camera.  The only editing that has been done to them is making the size smaller.
