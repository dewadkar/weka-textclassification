            In February of 1996 I bought a brand new 1996 Chevy Lumina. My wife always wanted one so after she rolled our S-10 Blazer we decided to get one. The one we got was medium blue with 16 miles on it. All was fine until it developed this annoying thumping noise in the rear end. Well, the dealership ended up having it more then us the first 3 months. They would call and say it was ready, I would go to pick it up, there was that noise again. We were told everything from a loose tire jack to, get this, the cigarette lighter laying in the ash tray. 

I would find Chuck, the head mechanic, and we would go for a ride. After about 20 yards Chuck would say he heard it. I would tell Chuck &quot;Don't call me back until you don't hear it any more.&quot; They changed all the struts, a-frame and bolts, all the major suspension parts. Guess what? It was still there. The appointment taker in the garage told us it was to be expected since the Luminas aren't that great of a car to begin with. (Curtis now works construction.) 

It was time to put the Lemon Law into action. One problem, they kept it all on the same call sheet. For $1000.00 to cover the tax we could pick out a new one. Forget it, we'll contact General Motors and let them know about the problem. Might as well have called NASA and told them to turn over those UFO files.

Well, we lived with it for 3 years until I got the best car money could buy. A 1997 Ford Taurus SHO. I almost cried because I was so happy to trade that car for a real one. OK, maybe I got that one-in-a-million dud. But because of it I now own a Ford Taurus SHO and a Ford Ranger pickup. Never again will I buy a Chevy product.<br><br>
