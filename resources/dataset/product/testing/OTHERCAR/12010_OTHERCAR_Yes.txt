            This car is the ultimate satisfaction for its price.  Of course you can see it looks sharp, and you'll have no trouble starting conversations when you pull up.
Only 5000 made each year, this car is still fairly uncommon.  Being different is worth something, I think. So do the Honda dealers, that is why this car commands such a high price sometimes.  I really recommend you look into buying used.  Look for a dealer that has a used model with low miles.  You still get the warranty, and you don't pay the dealer markup they put on the new models which can be over $5000. I got mine at an import dealer with 6000 miles. I saved over $8000 from a new model.

All the practical information you should know before you buy:

Maintenance is relatively affordable for a high-performance sports car: between $150-250/visit which are between 10000-25000 miles apart. You can count on Honda's reputation for quality and reliability.  This car has few troubles.  I've driven mine over 76000 miles in less than 3 years and I still have original breaks, clutch; all the things that typically wear out quick. Don't think about getting this car though, if you plan to avoid the maintenance.  You must have this car tuned up.  Oil changes are not an option.

Tires are not so affordable; plan for at least $500/set every 15,000-20,000 miles.  You'll need a completely different set if you live with winters of snow and ice.

Bucket seats are somewhat difficult to get in and out of. Being low to the ground doesn't help either. The seats also wear quickly on the sides.  If you contact a good upholstery shop, they can reinforce the padding and prevent or correct the wearing problem.

If you're looking at one with a plastic window, it does wear and can impair vision.  If you only plan to drive with the top down, this won't be an issue.

The convertible top is fairly easy to care for-just keep clean and use a protectant such as Finish 2000. Pick up a can of spray silicone for the rubber between the windows and roof.  Keeping these lubricated prevents leaks in the rain or car wash.

Lights are expensive: over $500 for 1 headlight to be replaced.  Consider an extended warranty for this alone.

Gas mileage is avg. at about 23 mpg on the highway.

This car is 6-speed.  It will take some getting used to if you're at all like me.  I kept wanting to go into 5th as a high gear.  They don't make this in an automatic.  Which I think is great, because sports cars are meant to be at the driver's command.

The experts who test cars say it goes 0-60 in less than 6 seconds.  The avg. driver like me will most likely not get that kind of performance.  You may not beat everyone off the line either.  If that's what you're looking for, this isn't the car for you.

The stereo system is below avg.  See a car stereo store to upgrade system and install speakers in head rests.

If you're a cell phone junkie and want the top down too, it's doable, but, you will strain to hear and may have to yell a bit.  I definitely recommend using a hands-free devise. This car isn't quiet even with the top up.  You hear and feel the road just like any sports car.  The top blocks out very little noise.  You might have trouble hearing someone on the phone even with the top up.

You'll love how easy the top is to operate: unlatch and push a button. The trunk space is adequate for a typical stewardess-type rolling suitcase and a briefcase.  People say it's small.  It won't hold a golf bag, but, it's bigger than most think.  You can use the area on the top when it's down, if you're not driving too far or too fast. I've hauled groceries, a vacuum cleaner, big boxes, etc.

This car has awesome handling and acceleration.
The instrument panel is digital, and easy to read.

If you're tall, don't worry--there is plenty of leg room.

If you're looking for an affordable, convertible, sports car, this is a great choice.
For those not used to the 2-seater, you might need to consider the pros and cons of passenger limitations.  Take these tips, and have fun driving!
