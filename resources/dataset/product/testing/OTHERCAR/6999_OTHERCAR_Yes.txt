            I purchased a 2002 Cavalier Base sedan in July 2002.  After two months and 1,800 miles, I can say that I am 80 percent satisfied with my car.  It is a bit loud at takeoff, but with the 4-speed automatic, quiets down nicely at highway speeds.  The air conditioning takes quite a while to cool down the car after it has been sitting in the sun. However, this could also be attributed to owning a dark blue car in South Florida.  

The driving position is quite comfortable, especially with the standard tilt wheel.  The seats are made of a durable fabric and are easily adjusted to most drivers specifications.  The standard CD player is a plus in a basic car.  It is nice having a knob to select stations manually, versus a search bar.  Fit and finish inside the car is also above par.

Gas mileage with the automatic has ranged from 25 MPG to 28 MPG around town.  The larger than average fuel tank allows for longer driving periods between fillups.

All in all, this is a good car for the money.  There are many extras for a basic car, such as CD player, remote trunk and tilt wheel.  However, a glaringly obvious omission is power mirrors.  In my opinion, you can't go wrong with this car.
