            Saab 9-5 2.3L Stick
I must confess, one of the main reasons I ended up buying the Saab over a 328 was because the dealer cut me an insane deal on the 99's going out. While it is *not* as sporty as I would want it to be, I would still call it a great Car if you cannot afford a 540i or a A6 2.7 Turbo. 

Handles better than it feels, does give you an indication of body roll. Highway cruising is GREAT! the Car is rock stable even at speeds &gt; 120 MPH. Pickup in the 0-60 department could be better, but passing feels better than most cars I have driven including sports cars. Possible due to the full of torque available in the 1800 to 4000 RPM range. 

Anyone, who is sick of seeing tiny BMWs(3 series are Sub Compacts) and Acura TLs getting stuffed into their parking lot/Neighbourhood should get a 9-5. Be Different! Some say the Saab has a higher snob factor than a bimmer, if that does anything for you.

I also find it a better drive than the 9-3s I test drove. 

My other Car is a Honda Prelude SH VTEC screamer, so I had high expectations while looking for a sedan. Things I don't like; hate the gear shift, and the slight body roll. I beleive the roll is a cheap fix and it is easy to boost the Turbo to get me north of 200 HP out of this, though I am not sure I will need it.

I have currently leased it, and am tempted to buy if off. 

Oh Yes, I have a base with all the SE options, leather, sunroof, seats etc except the Harmon Kardon Stereo, get that, the BASE stereo is not that great... <br><br>
