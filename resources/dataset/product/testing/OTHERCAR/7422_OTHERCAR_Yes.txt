            I am actually pretty impressed with this camera.  I bought it to replace my larger 2.0 mega-pixel Kodak that I loved, only because this was small enough to fit in my pocket.  I can take it with me, without the hassles of a camera bag.  I have bought spare batteries on eBay for $20.00 for 2, and also purchased a battery charger on eBay too. That was about $30.  Now I don't need to use the camera to recharge the batteries.  I also bought a USB 6 in 1 card reader, so I don't have to use the cradle to download pictures.

The one serious complaint I have is the compression factor on the SD memory chip.  If I take a picture in the 1600 x 1200 fine resolution, it uses about 1,200 KB on the chip.  I can open and resave the same picture, using photo editors, and it reduces the size to about 210 KB.  That means the camera is not compressing jpg images correctly.  It also means that you're only getting about 20% of the full utilization of your memory chip.  I've written Casio, and through our dialog, they admitted they didn't know about the problem.  They said they had no solution, but would suggest a fix to their development staff.  I doubt that will ever happen.  Just something to be aware of.  If anyone has a solution to this problem, please email me at Mitch.Harper@HotByteSoftware.com.
