                Back in 1997 my parents acquired a Trooper II from a friend who was moving out of town and couldn't take it with her. It was a Maroon '88 Isuzu Trooper II, 4 door, 4x4 with 31' x 10.50 off roading tires and star Mag rims. It looked really sharp. Let me just say that they look better with over sized tires. The lady we acquired the vehicle from took it out in the woods quite a bit and liked to see how much mud she could get on it. 
  The truck had over 200,000 miles on it and when I sold it, all it needed was a head gasket. The truck had major pulling power too. It would go any where. Even places that Huge lifted Chevys couldn't get. I am really kicking myself for getting rid of it. I highly recommend that if you like to go hunting or just going out in the woods that you get one. I also highly recommend that if you get one that you never let it go. <br><br>
