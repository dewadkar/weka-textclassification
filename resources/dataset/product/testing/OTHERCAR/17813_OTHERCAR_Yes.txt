            I graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in Computer Science in 1993. I had a great job lined up, but I hadn't started working yet. I always loved Ferraris, especially the smaller mid engine ones like the 328 with the targa top. When I saw the MR2 Turbo in an auto magazine, I fell in love.

I could afford the car payments on one, barely, but I didn't have any money to put down. It turned out that Toyota has a special program for college graduates. They set me up with a 5 year lease at 3.95% on a brand new fully loaded '93 MR2 Turbo. All I had to put down was my 1st month's lease payment, registration fees, and a $300 deposit!

THIS CAR IS SO MUCH FUN. Above all else, it is graceful. The car is so well balanced, you can get it to go around turns SIDEWAYS! Go to an autocross some time and try it. The acceleration is pretty good, and the car is very stable at any speed. Few cars, even today, outperform the MR2 on handling and breaking abilities.

In addition to awesome racing performance, the car is very comfortable. There's plenty of headroom and legroom, and the trunk is big enough for a weekend trip. Having T-Tops is great; you get that open feel even when the weather is bad. The stero is hands down the best car stereo I've ever heard. This little two seater car came with a factory installed 100 watt per channel 8 speaker (2 tweeters, 4 midrange, and 2 subwoofers) CD/Cassette/FM-AM Radio sound system.

I have put nearly 140,000 miles on my MR2 Turbo (which I got brand new), and have had no major mechanical problems. I take good care of the car. I change the oil myself every 2,500 miles with synthetic oil, and I change the air filter every 15,000 miles. I take it to the dealer every 30,000 miles for a major servicing. That being said, I beat on it every day. I accelerate hard, and I take it to autocrosses to race in a safe environment. I've driven it at over 100 MPH for over an hour straight in the middle of the desert in 120 degree heat with the air conditioner on full blast, and the temp gague remained exactly in the middle between H and C. I've driven this car across country in 4 days.

The MR2 Turbo is one of the best sports cars ever built.<br><br>
