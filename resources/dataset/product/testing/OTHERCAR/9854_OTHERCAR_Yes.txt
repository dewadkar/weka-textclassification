            I went through a divorce and needed a new car.  I had previously owned a '69 Camaro in which my x-husband and I built from scratch, so my love for the car led me directly to the Chevrolet showroom floor.

It didn't take any persuasion from the salesperson in getting me to purchase this car.  I already knew I was buying it before I walked in the door.  This is not typical of the average car buying person.  I was lucky that it just happened to be one of the biggest car selling days of the year - Presidents Day.  I was able to get a fully loaded Camaro RS for only $13,000.

Great things about the car...
POWER - should I say more?  If you have a heavy foot and not so nice police in your town, then take it easy on that gas peddal!  It doesn't take much to get this baby to move.
GAS MILEAGE - believe it or not, I thought it did pretty good on gas mileage for a muscle car.  I got about 210 miles to the tank.
COMFORT - If you are the driver or the front seat passenger, you'll be more than comfy, just don't drive in the back seat.  This car is not made for being a taxi cab as it has no back seat passenger comfort! 
CONSOLE - The console had everything in reach, accessible without much effort of moving hands off the wheel or taking your eye off the road.
RACING - I don't agree with racing in the streets, but I use to drive race cars at a young age.  No I'm not a redneck, I just got involved with guys who were mechanics.  I have to put my 2 cents into the FORD/CHEVY competition.  When I first picked up my Camaro, I didn't make it 2 blocks from the dealership when a Mustang (grrr) pulled up next to me and wanted to race.  I KNOW I shouldn't have raced him being that the Camaro was new and all, but I was NOT to be intimidated by a FORD!  Lets just say my baby beat the pants off that old horse.

Things I didn't particularly care for..
FUEL PUMP - Within 6 months after I purchased the car new, the fuel pump went on me.  It took Chevy 1 week and NO LOANER car to fix the thing.
NOISY - I shouldn't complain because this IS a muscle car, but for those of you who do not like a squeaky, noisy car - move on.  It is typical for a Camaro to squeak, rattle and do a not so great job on keeping out road noise.
DASHBOARD - I am on the tall side 5'9, and always had a problem (until I got use to it) with the dashboard.  The dash comes up high where it meets the windshield, so if you are short, you are going to have a hard time looking out the front windshield to see the nose of the car!
SPOILERS - Not thinking, I got the extended front spoiler (for looks) for the nose of the car.  MISTAKE!  To this day, (now driving a Chevy Prism) I still drive on an angle when backing out of driveways, going over bumps, etc.  The spoiler on the Camaro ALWAYS bottomed out on the TINIEST of dips in the road, driveways, etc.
TRANSMISSION - I took absolutely the best care of this car - it was my baby.  By the end of 3 years it needed a new transmission (over $800) - and no it wasn't from racing or driving the car hard.
TIRES - I didn't have the best of luck with keeping tires.  By the end of 3 years and less than 30,000 miles I needed new tires.  Back in 1994 the cost of the tires were $175 each - OUCH!
SPINOUTS - BE CAREFUL in rain and snow - again I can't stress enough that this is a muscle car.  Doing a 180 on a major highway because the roads were a little wet while I was doing the speed limit, going with the curve on the highway led me to SLOW DOWN IN RAIN!  And SNOW?  HA!  Forget it - just keep the car in the garage for the winter!

I absolutely LOVED this car for all the wrong reasons.   Yes it was a top performer, but maintenance on it was very high.  If you are looking for a car with low maintenance, find yourself another car.  Now, as a parent, I would not recommend this car as a first car for any 1st time driver due to the power and the racing reputation that comes along with it.  If you can afford it, this is a typical college aged student car.  It has the looks, the fun, the sportyness and economy for someone in that age group, who can take on a little more responsibility.<br><br>
