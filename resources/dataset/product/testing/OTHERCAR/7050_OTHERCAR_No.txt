            Having owned my first real car, a 1986 BMW 525iSE for over 6 years, I wanted to replace it with a car that was as reliable and had the same sort of build quality as the BMW but as I couldn't afford a good BMW, I thougt I'd buy a Japanese car and save money by not having expensive parts, insurance and 'paying for the badge.'

After looking at various cars on the road, I decided on a Mazda Xedos 6, but after several months I hadn't found a suitable one, I went to the auction as a spectator and saw a Silver 626, I bid �2700 and won.

After several weeks of ownership, the problems started to mount. the hatchback would mostly not stay up, unless the parcel shelf was wedged, then it would suddenly crash on my head.

The main beam headlights are so bad they should be illegal.

The rear brake caliper seized. (they all do it)

The cupholder bow-tie broke off.

The Coin holder will not stay shut.

There is an inch of play in the manual gear shift, even on a much newer one I tried at the dealer.

The seat has inadequate lumbar support for long journies and has no lumbar adjustment.

The brakelights, headlights, foglights etc... work without the key in the ignition.

The driver's doorlock and tailgate lock don't work properly.

The tailgate squeaks like a van.

A knocking ocurrs in the headlining.

Someone broke the mirror glass, and this isn't available as a part, I had to spend �150 ($250) on a whole mirror!

And how expensive are the parts? Much more than the BMW and they are of an inferior quality.

I do think it is noisy at higher speeds and the window rubbers turn themselves over.

The dashboard switches and warning lights are hap-hazard and inconsistant (they dont even all match)

The good points are....

Comfy on short journies, absorbs speed humps well.

Standard ABS.

The handling is secure and has no surprises.

The dipped projector headlights are very crisp.

I like the styling.

I wouldn't have bought it if I could go back, as they are highly over-rated and hyped, and most of my faults are mentioned in Mazda TSBs or the NHAST? website or generally seem common on the web.
