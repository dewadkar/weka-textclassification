            The Acura Integra could be described as a Poor Man's Porsche. It has decent power, handling, and comfort at a reasonable price. I originally purchased my Integra because of the support that has been shown for the car by the aftermarket. If you look, there are thousands of companies that have products to help the performance, looks and overall character of the Integra. From the factory, the Integra is already rather quick, especially the GS-R model. The 170 HP engine will pull quite well when asked. If you want, you can get all the creature comforts found in luxury cars such as leather seating, power windows, power sunroof, alloy wheels, premium stereo, cruise control, and many other options. If you're a little more budget minded, the base model LS Integra is quite functional and sporty at the same time. With small investments in the aftermarket, you can personalize your Integra with a variety of products. Like any other car, the Integra does have it's downsides. some find it's styling quite bland, I find the two headlights on either side quite non-Acura like. The leg room could be better, trunk room could be better, and last the dash controls can be awkward at times. If you are looking for a quality built sporty yet economical automobile, the Integra would fit you very well. Keep in mind for the year 2000 they are dropping the sedan version, so only two-door coupes will be available.<br><br>
