            Though the Dodge Dakota R/T is not as fast as say, the Ford Lightning, it is plenty fast, and fun for every one to enjoy. The main reason I chose the Dakota over the Lightning is price. The lightning costs $31,000, vs the dakota $23,000. The Dodge is a very competent sport truck, but not very usefull as truck anymore. It is only rated at 2000lbs for towing, even though it has a 250h.p., 345lb./ft of torque 360 cubic inch v-8. One downside to this truck is gas mileage. This truck manages just 12/16 mpg city/hwy. Also, forget about trying to use this truck in the winter. it only comes in rear wheel drive form, and is very unstable in the snow. It also has great handling for a truck, .83g lateral acceleration vs. .69 for a regular Dakota SLT. 
Driving this truck is just as easy as any car. It rides harsh, but if you are after performance it is just something you will get used to. this truck is just as fast if not faster than most cars out on the road. 0-60 is done in 7sec., and the quarter mile is covered in 15.4/89mph. If you are looking for an impresive performer, solid truck that will last forever, and a good deal this is a definte must see truck!
