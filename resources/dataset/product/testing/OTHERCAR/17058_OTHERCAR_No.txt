                My experiences with an Audi A4 began back in the spring of 1997, when I was still in high school.  Dad's beloved 1987 Audi 5000 turbo Quattro was ready to retire, so he bought a very nice 1997 A4 1.8T Quattro with the sport package.  His example was black on black, had an Audi/Delta stereo, sixteen inch five spoke wheels, and special "jacquard" seats.  Needless to say, it was a beautiful automobile.
     I drove the car on a regular basis, and I was always very pleased with its performance.  The engine was smooth and quiet, and the turbo spooled up immediately.  That being said, it wasn't a particularly fast car, but it at least felt that way.  The Quattro system and the rest of the car were pretty heavy, and I would guess that the 150 horsepower four could probably nail sixty in about nine seconds, or possibly high eights.  Regardless, I never found myself wishing for more power.
     The car handled well, and one would have to try hard to get it stuck in the snow.  On dry roads, the little Audi felt good when pushed up to about eight tenths of its limits, but anything beyond that caused it to feel a bit flustered.  The suspension pumps furiously when you are hauling serious butt on switchbacks, and the car is naturally prone to understeere.  On the other hand, lurid four wheel drifts are also possible.  The only down side to this is that the car does not feel very confident performing such moves, courtesy of a rather porky curb weight.  In a non track environment, though, I don't think this is a liability, and should not deter most people from purchasing this car.  In the real world, most owners would be immensely pleased.
     The car's steering felt great, although not quite on par with some BMWs I have driven.  The brakes were strong and easy to control, but the first quarter inch of travel was grabby.  The five speed automatic was initially smooth and fluid, but after a couple of years there were occasions where it would "hunt" for gears.  After a momentary pause, it would then shift with a harshness that you could feel jar the entire chassis.  The interior was possibly the most beautifully designed I have ever been in, but the back seats are short on legroom, and I wouldn't try to put three adults back there.
     Now, about that aforementioned problem with the automatic&#133  In the summer of 2000 we took the car in to have that checked on.  When the dealer called back, they had some majorly bad news: both front control arms were bad, the oil cooler was shot, the drive shaft was bad, and the head gasket was blown.  All of this, and the warranty had just run out 2000 miles ago.  We were appalled, but instead of being forced to cover a bill of over $6000, Audi of North America stood behind the car, and fixed the repairs without charge.  They simply replied that "this should not have happened."  We were hugely impressed, but scared of what other problems we might have with the car.  Needless to say, dad traded it in immediately.  
     After doing some research, I found that the front control arm design of all A4s through 1999 was shoddy, to say the least.  The bearing where the A arm connects to the wheel assembly is prone to wear out every 30,000 to 60,000 miles.  This bearing is an inseparable part of the A arm, so you have to replace the whole piece to the tune of about $400 dollars plus labor.  As for the other problems, we have no idea what went wrong.  The car was religiously serviced, and while driven hard, was never run past red line or allowed to overheat.  I have spoken to several other A4 owners, and they have not encountered problems this severe.  Perhaps we just had a lemon, or Audi is aware of problems and they are fixing the cars as they come in for service.  Who knows.
     I guess all I can really say is that the 1997 A4 is a great all weather car, is fun to drive, and has an interior worthy of the longest two person road trip.  The reliability of the car is highly questionable, and if someone else buys a used model and has the problems we did, they might not receive the same treatment from the dealer.
