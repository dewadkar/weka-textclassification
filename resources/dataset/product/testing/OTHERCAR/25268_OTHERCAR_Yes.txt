            I do not know a whole lot about this vehicle, but I was in line at school to pick up my kids and I was behind one of these Toyota Land Cruiser's and I instantly fell in love with it! I was trying to describe to my husband what it looked like and he couldn't figure out what I was talking about, so we went to the Toyota dealership and I found one and showed it to him. To my amazement, he liked it too and told me to see what the sticker price on it was.... GULP!!! $68,885.00!!!!! I told him that it was JUST a dream car! I like how it sits up high and how it is built- it just looks MEAN!! I LOVE it!!<br><br>
