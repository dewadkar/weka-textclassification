            The equations are simple, really. More pixels equal better resolution. More pixels equal a bigger price tag. The Kodak DC260's top-end resolution of 1,536 by 1,024 pixels generates nearly 1.6 million of the little devils, enough for us to identify distant objects that other cameras portrayed as mere blobs of blocky dots. The camera also shoots at 1,152 by 768 and 768 by 512, and its 8MB CompactFlash card stores between 14 and 90 images. Our quality jury voted the DC260 a hands-down winner over every other camera in this roundup. But you pay dearly for such a prize: the DC260 lists at a mind-numbing $899. 
Packs in the features
Although the DC260 is a bit larger than most digicams, it's a comfortable fit in the hand, and the controls--including those for the 3X motorized, optical zoom--are for the most part in the right place. A slew of cool features push this camera right to the edge of the professional zone. You get a 2-inch LCD, burst-rate shooting mode (which takes up to eight quick pics at rates as fast as three frames per second), an in-camera photo album organizer, multiple flash modes, and manual and automatic exposure. Yet the DC260 is easy enough to use that it's nearly point-and-shoot.
