            We bought this when our 94 Trooper started to get a little old.  My wife likes the idea of a sport ute (she buys a lot of stuff at the garden center), but hated to drive the Trooper because it felt to big and "tippy".  I needed to have a vehicle that would tow our 3000 lb boat and trailer.  We also needed something that would do well in the sand as we vacation in the Outer Banks.  The Axiom fit everybody's needs.  It is a great value for the price.  It has almost every feature that you could want (except for stereo controls on the steering wheel).  It has excellent pick up and does not feel at all "tippy".  There is plenty of room inside and tows the boat handily (it is rated for 4500 lbs.).  The TOD works flawlessly and gives you a sense of security on wet roads.  The brakes are four wheel anti-lock and the rotors are vented!  The only features that we wished it had that it does not is a lift up rear window separate from the door, a roof rack standard and stereo controls on the steering wheel.  Overall we love the car.  I have been in every other SUV on the market and this one is a home run for Isuzu.
