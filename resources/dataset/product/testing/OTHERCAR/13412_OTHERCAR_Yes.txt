            I originally purchased this vehicle because of I wanted a vehicle that was heavy duty AND I didn't want a pick-up truck.  I test drove the Chevy Blazer and the Ford Explorer before purchasing the Blazer.  I found that the Blazer rode much more smoothly and was a lot quieter.
I love the &quot;on the fly&quot; four wheel drive.  It makes driving in Wisconsin much safer and easier.  By having this option there is no need to get out of your vehicle to put it into four wheel drive.  I also found that the stereo system is very good and very reliable.  It puts out great sound and has never required any type of maintenance.
Some things that I do not care for on the Chevy Blazers are the seats and the braking system.  The seats are not comfortable when taking long trips.  They lack cushioned support.  As far as the brakes are concerned, when slowing for 45 mph you will notice a &quot;shimmering&quot; or &quot;shaking&quot; in the front of the vehicle.

I do enjoy driving the Chevy Blazer.  I find it to be a great vehicle for myself and my pet dog.  I do not recommend this vehicle for families, especially those with pets.  If you have a child and a pet, there is not much room left for any suitcases or travel gear. <br><br>
