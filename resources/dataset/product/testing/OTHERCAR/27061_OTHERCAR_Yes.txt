            The Olympus D-450 Zoom is not a bad camera. It's certainly not the best digital camera out there, but it takes good pictures, and once you learn the obscure icons, isn't too hard to use.

Pros:
Optical zoom and 1.3 megapixel quality means it's easy to get good quality pictures
No lens cap to lose
Feels solid, high quality
Fast recycle time between pictures
SmartMedia cards are wonderful -- easy, portable, and with a PC card holder, makes it really easy to get your pictures to your computer.

Cons:
Why can't anyone figure out an intuitive interface for digital cameras? With no manual, it'll take awhile to figure this one out.
Hard to quickly slip the lens cover into the right position for viewing previously taken images
Buttons are hard to press consistently and accurately. Sometimes they don't register the pressure.
Flip-up flash means you have to remember to flip it up -- much nicer to have an integrated flash that's always there.
