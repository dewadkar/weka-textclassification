            I've owned 5 Cadillacs,2 Lincolns,and 3 Buicks in the past,and this Lesabre is all, if not more car then all of them put together. the ride (mine has the gran touring package) is outstanding for a automobile of this size and weight, comfort level is second to none,and my family of five look so much better in this car than any mini van built.I have had no mechanical complaints,but I do stay right on top of schedule maint. My only concern is the poor visibility out the back window,but I have learned to "judge my location" when backing up. This car is a outstanding choice for a family on a budget.
