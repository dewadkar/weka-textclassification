The 2000 Toyota Avalon is truly a work of art.... inside and out.Looking more like a mercedes benz that your usual Toyota, it is eye catching and impressive. Looks are just the beginning of this fabulous ride on 4 wheels. Luxury from the heated seats to the dual temperature control for front seat area. Roomy seating, with enough space for a 6'4&quot; frame and comfy fit for a midget of 5'4&quot;.... seat controls that remember your settings from driver 1 to  driver 2. Thrifty soul that I am, I was worried that all this luxury would pay the price in loss of mileage. Not so.... 25 - 32 mpg on the highway and an easy 25 in the city eased my mind.         If you want the luxury and comfort of a much higher priced vehicle and love the dependability of a Toyota..... then you should definately test drive one of these dream cars.<br><br>
