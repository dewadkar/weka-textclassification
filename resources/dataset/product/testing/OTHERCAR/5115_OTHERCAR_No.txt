            <b>&quot;A <i>Value-what</i>?!?  Uuuhhh...I'm Not Sure About This!&quot;</b>
<i>&quot;I dunno...&quot; my husband stated squeemishly.  &quot;Are you sure about this car, hon?&quot; he asked.

&quot;No, but it's the best one we've looked at that's in our budget.&quot; I reluctantly replied about the used 1994 Dodge Intrepid ES.  We were sitting unattended in a small cubical-like office at CarMax in Laurel, Maryland in June of 1998.  </i>

The car we were purchasing had been deemed an inexpensive &quot;ValueMax&quot; vehicle; it had no warranty because of its age and the 85K+ miles it had racked up over the years.  It was an <b>AS IS</b>, the terminology dreaded by most car buyers.  But, *SIGH*, we were on a tight budget and, since he lost his 1995 Eagle Talon Tsi during his bankruptcy a couple of months prior, he didn't have too much of a choice,  [FYI: CarMax's &quot;ValueMax&quot; vehicles are priced low to move.  Some have problems and some don't.  Each car is inspected by CarMax mechanics but no two mechanics are alike.  What one mechanic might scrutinize over may go undetected by another.  I should know; my cousin is a mechanic there now.  I wish he was there when we were buying this car!]


<b>&quot;Break Out that Fine-toothed Comb and Start Sorting Through that Haystack!&quot;</b>
My husband's requirements in a vehicle narrowed our search even further.  Because of his large size, he wanted a more spacious vehicle.  It had to have four doors because he had difficulty strapping and unstrapping our daughter in her car seat in a two door, as he did in my Mazda MX-6. 

The car had to be tough.  Because of his constant driving for work and his volunteer services, it had to have the ability to drive 35K+ miles per year.  His future car also had to boast a 6-cylinder engine or higher because: 1.) despite his denials, he enjoys having a lead-foot (boy, is he gonna kill me for writing that!), 2.) the engine had to be strong enough to carry itself <i><b>and</i></b> lug him around at the same time (my husband's a pretty big boy...sumo wrestling anyone?) and 3.) the engine size had to satisfy him psychologically.  

My husband's finicky about everything, including cars, so searching for a vehicle that met ALL of this requirements was the most challenging car search I've ever done for anyone; it was like searching for a needle in an elephant-sized haystack with an ant-sized fine-toothed comb. It was an exhausting process but urgently necessary because after being shared by two people for a couple of months, I wanted to give my car a well-deserved vacation!  [If you're interested in a 1993 Mazda MX-6 LS, please refer to my &quot;Highly Recommended&quot; Epinion's review entitled &quot;Go, Mommy! Go&quot;  Thanks! :)]


<b>&quot;Sign Here, Please...and Here...and Here.  Oh, and Here Too.&quot;</b>
My husband had cold feet during the entire search for his future car and, understandably so, they turned to ice when we finally sat down to sign the papers for the Intrepid.  The Intrepid was the only car that fit his criteria, and was the most logical choice.

<i>&quot;How about that Honda Accord?&quot; he asked.  &quot;What was wrong with that one?&quot;

&quot;It has over 100K miles on it, remember?  Plus, its a four-cylinder.&quot;  I replied about the other &quot;ValueMax&quot; vehicle we had seen on the CarMax lot.

&quot;Oh.&quot; he thought for a moment.  &quot;How about that Mustang then?&quot;  

&quot;I wish!&quot; I said.  </i>

A beautiful red 1995 Ford Mustang GT (the last year Mustangs were created with the infamous 5.0L engine), with 35K miles on it, was on the showroom floor.  The draw back was the $12,500 price tag.  That amount would put us at about 35% higher in monthly payments than what we could afford, not to mention the higher cost of auto insurance.

So...we bought the 1994 Dodge Intrepid ES at the non-negotiable price of $9,700.00 with, stupidly, no money down.


<b>&quot;She's Past Her Prime Now.  What a Shame.&quot;</b> 
It was smooth sailing for a couple of months after we bought the Intrepid.  Then, out of no where, all hell broke loose.

The transmission, between third and fourth gears, slipped periodically and progressively worsened.  The head gasket seals leaked and needed replacement.  The starter occasionally refused to turn over, even after being replaced.  The driver's side power door lock stopped working and the driver's side power seat stopped reclining forward.  The air conditioning needed frequent recharges and the compressor needed replacing.  The rotors needed replacement.  The car had been in an accident with the former owner, which was not disclosed at the time of signing, and the damage incurred gradually worsened (unbeknownst to us); the whole front axel had to be replaced.  Because of some ignorant kid at Jiffy Lube, the power steering box had to be replaced.  Most of these problems were the result of having car past its prime (and an irresponsible person at Jiffy Lube...that's what I get for not taking the time to change the oil myself!)  The starter problem is the only one I know of that is strictly a Dodge / Chrysler / Plymouth problem.  

The suspension, however, was smooth.  The steering was a little looser than I like but adequate.  The emergency break pedal was a pain; it would sometimes stick.  It had plenty of interior room, comfortably fitting five adults.  The seats were suitable for long car rides, but uncomfortable for snoozing.  The factory cassette / stereo was decent but if we could have afforded an upgrade, we would have happily gotten one.  There was a cargo net in the trunk, a long with a spare tire and jack (but no instructions or guide for those inept in simple car repairs).  We didn't receive a manual when we purchased the car, to no surprise since it was a little old.  

The body design had an aggressive stance, a car who's bark is slightly worse than it's bite.  The car does well in acceleration, for an automatic but occasionally the accelerator pedal would stick if stomped on (yes, it was scary at times).  If we had caught the car in its prime, I know we would've been happier.


<b>What It Boils Down To</b>
In the end, with all of the money we shelled out (and borrowed) a for the Intrepid's repairs, we could've very well afforded the 5.0L Mustang.  Believe it or not, we still have the Intrepid; no one wants to buy it, with good reason.  To save mileage on my MX-6, I drive the Intrepid on short trips on cool days (I always make sure that I don't drive on the highway with it and I keep my cell phone handy, just in case!)  About six months ago, I went out and bought my husband a brand new 2000 Hyundai Sonata GLS and, despite its smaller size compared to the Intrepid, he loves it.  [Please see my &quot;Highly Recommended&quot; Epinion review on the 2000 Hyundai Sonata GLS entitled &quot;Ultimate Oxymoron: Rich and Affordable&quot;.]

If you're thinking of purchasing a 1994 Dodge Intrepid ES, beware.  I'm sure it was a fine vehicle in its day but as with anything, all good things must come to an end.  If you're still intent on purchasing one, look for one that has low mileage and please inquire about its history.  Don't make the same mistake we did.<br><br>
