            	In December of 2001 we purchased our Daewoo, Leganza. We had looked at many different Automobiles, many sizes and makes. After much consideration we decided on the Leganza. This car was a very impressive looking automobile, which afforded many options for our money compared to other cars in this class. 
	The car we would purchase was a demo, which was loaded to the hilt. When we settled on a price we was well under the 15000.00 price tag which was on the vehicle. We took delivery of this car at 2500 miles. Today five months later we have a little over 18000 on the car and have had no trouble with it. 
	The car averages 35 to 40 MPG and rides great doing so. I have no problems driving down the road listening to my favorite tunes, on the sound system which is great, for this class automobile as a standard option. The speaker package is a good combination with the other equipment.
	As for the seating and room the Laganza seats our family of five with two college students and a junior high student with very little problems. I drive 97 miles a day round trip to work, the car affords a comfortable ride both morning and afternoon.  
	I would recommend this car to anyone who is looking for affordable transportation with a stylish look. The prices on the automobile is good, and the warranty gives the buyer bumper to bumper protection, with an option for an extended warranty.
