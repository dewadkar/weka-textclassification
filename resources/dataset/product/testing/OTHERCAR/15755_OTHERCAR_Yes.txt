            The Canon Powershot has just about everything you can expect when paying about $500 for a digital camera in its range. I got the camera about two months ago, and I must admit I am having fun with it. I've always been a picture oriented person, and I have been known to run through disposable cameras & countless rolls of film on all the pictures I love to take. So i figured, cost-wise, I should invest in a digital camera. I previously owned the Nikon Coolpix 775, but I had ended up selling that because it didn't meet my picture taking needs. I must say, the Canon S40 does have a handful of features, but there are a few disappointments here & there. 

Features: 
4.1 megapixels
10 different picture taking modes (including movie mode)
LCD screen
11x zoom
voice recorder (to accompany movie mode)
direct connection option to computer or printer
convenient detachable hand strap
auto & manual focus
white balance control/ red-eye reduction
optional flash modes
auto timer
wide picture range
different picture effects (black&white, sepia, etc)
picture clarity: superfine, fine, normal
optional photo sizing
USB port with cord
small, compact charger (easy to use)


With all these features in mind, there are still a few things to keep in mind. The reaction time is a tiny bit too slow, but that I can definitely deal with. My pictures come out exceptionally clear and focused. My main concern would have to be the software. The directions in the manual aren't very precise. Naturally, the installation process will vary from computer to computer, but Canon didn't seem to take that into consideration. After a while, I did in fact get it all figured out. I do like the extent of the battery life. I upgraded my compact flash memory card to 128MB, which can take around 1000+ pictures on the 'normal' picture option, and the battery will still have some life in it. Overall, I do like the camera. It is a little delicate, and weighs a little more than I would like, but all in all, it takes wonderful pictures- which meets my needs in the end. I would recommend the Canon Powershot S40 to a friend.
