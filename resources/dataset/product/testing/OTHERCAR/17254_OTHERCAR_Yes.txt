            I'm not sure why an opinion was posted on a 1993 Intrepid! (6 year old used car) I have a '99 Intrepid with 48,000 miles on it and would buy another in a heart beat! The 1999 model is a whole new car. Even the '98 is not the same. Just one look will tell you that. It will catch your eye every time on the road. 

INSIDE- The room inside equals that of the larger and heavier Concord model, even though the car outside is much smaller. 

OUTSIDE-The trunk was intelligently designed to hold a whole bunch of stuff. Check out how the trunk lid raises and the ample storage 'back under'. Also, there must be some sort of plastic in certain key parts of the body. The first week I bumped into a parked car with my lower fender and no dent? After a car wash the scuff disappeared.. not even a permanent mark?

STYLE- Just look at it! Enough said.

THE RIDE/HANDLING- Great, Smooth

DEPENDABILITY- even after 48K the car has been trouble free with one minor exception..a small leak in the power steering line.

p.s. I promise I don't sell 'em. I just really like the one I own. A 1999.
