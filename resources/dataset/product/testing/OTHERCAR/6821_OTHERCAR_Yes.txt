            OK, I'll say it.  I own a station wagon.

Now that that's out of the way, I can tell you how much I enjoy this car.  First off all, we bought our Sable used from a dealership.  The car was in mint condition, had 22,000 miles,  and had some options that we wouldn't have normally paid for (CD player, lumbar (massage) seats, sound system). We paid $14,000.  We have now owned the car for about 10 months.

What we like about this car.  <b>It is very spacious and comfortable. </b>  We can easily fit two people next to the middle baby seat with room for two more in the rear-facing wagon seat.  So far, <b>it is reliable. </b>  The only problem we have had was a recent one.  One of our doors (can't tell which one) is occasionally not being registered as shut which leaves the interior light on.  I'm told this is an inexpensive fix.  Though it might seem big, <b>it is easy to drive. </b>  My wife traded in a small Toyota Tercel for this car and she loves how it drives. <b>It starts up without having to out your foot on the gas.</b>  For some reason, I love this.  I also love the CD player and the sound system (a real bonus).  The stereo and heating console are intuitive (except for the rear-wiper and rear-wipe-and-squirt buttons).  We can set the temperature and the thermostat does the rest.

Before I bought this car, I did a lot of research on the web (I recommend you do the same).  If I could have afforded 17-18K, I might have gone for a Suburu.  They were rated more reliable.  However, they are also smaller and more expensive to fix.  All in all, I learned a used, low-mileage, mint condition Sable was the best deal for us for under 15K.  Good luck!
