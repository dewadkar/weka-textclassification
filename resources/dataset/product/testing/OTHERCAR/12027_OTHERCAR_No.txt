            Honda�s innovative VTEC (Variable Valve Timing and Lift Control) engines have always impressed me a great deal. Most engines cycle breathing based on specified, and timed revolutions of the engine. However, no two cycles are precisely the same. The VTEC engine varies breathing with differing cam lobes, based on each specific revolution. This optimizes combustion chamber efficiency, which in turn reduces emissions, and improves power delivery. While breathing efficiently, it is doing so through 4 valves in every cylinder. VTEC�s have, subsequently, been able to produce an incredible amount of horsepower per liter in a normally aspirated engine that is small, and subsequently light in weight. Honda did not really invent this technology, as many manufacturers have toyed with it. In fact, Cadillac hit the market with its variable valve timed Northstar V8 engine, a couple of years before Honda did. Thus far, though, Honda seems to do it best. In the recently released S2000, Honda is flexing its technological muscles even more by offering the most powerful and efficient VTEC yet. The result has been a lightweight, rear drive, 4-cylinder roadster that floats around the $30K mark and can do 0-60 in 5.7 seconds. On paper this sounds like a dream come true. But how does this technological trickery behave getting groceries, or slotting throughout traffic? More importantly, is the product moving beyond the technology?

Admittedly, my experience with the S2000 is limited, that is to say, I had a ride in one last summer. My efforts to secure a test drive have been, thus far, unsuccessful (more on this later). But, from what I have observed in my brief ride, read in magazines, and learned from owners, I simply cannot recommend this car.

Blasphemy! How could he say this about a Honda that performs like this?! Settle down, everyone, and let me explain � hell they even let Christo explain, and my reasoning doesn�t involve six and a half million square feet of hot pink polypropylene. First the good. The S2000 is a very solid car; in fact it feels to be carved from a single piece of aluminum. Interior comfort is marvelous, featuring supportive seating that grips your frame ideally, and a firm, but gentle seat pan. Space is perfectly acceptable, and the trunk is of marginally usable size. The dash, though plain in appearance is simple, and easy to understand � I especially like the engine start button. Exterior styling is appropriately aggressive, in an understated Honda way. The shark nose and large, lower bumper air intake scream, �street rod�, but the angular side sweeps and simple wheels remind you of civil Honda family origins. The car does, photograph better than it looks in person, though if the top is down, it will still strike you as attractive to see it.  Top up, the body�s short cockpit section, combined with a need for headroom and adequate surface area for the trunk lid, create an unattractively tall and squared off roofline with an overly steep rear window section. Handling is marvelously stable and predictable at any speed. The S revs better than a 12 cylinder Ferrari 250 LM, and simply loves to be pushed to racetrack extremes. High gearing is equally matched to the screaming engine, giving the Honda terrific performance capabilities at the limit. Even with all of this free-revving, speedster action, the car still feels Honda quality, inside and out. As a track companion, the S2000 is near ideal.

But what about you people that will never take your S2000 to the track. I like to refer to you as �the majority�. You simply cannot argue with 120 horsepower per liter. However, in order to achieve this breathtaking feat, and see the performance numbers that the car magazines see, the engine must be revved incredibly high, and kept constantly boiling. The S2000 produces 240 (total) of the most difficult to use horsepower I have seen on a street car.  Maximum torque is not available until 7500 rpm�s, and even then, you only have 153 lb/ft. Maximum horsepower does not arrive until an incredible 8300 rpm�s! The problem with these sorts of characteristics is that it makes it difficult for average people to draw the power out. At 60 miles per hour, the S cruises along at 3300 rpm�s. To rocket ahead to 80, the S driver would have to downshift into 4th and let the revs build before letting the power back into the transmission � and that�s if you have practiced enough with your S2000, to get the tach to hit the sweet spot. A BMW Z3 3.0i, for example delivers it�s max torque at only 3500 rpm�s, giving you all of the power you need, right on demand for normal driving. These phenomenal S2000 runs to 60 that all the car magazines rave about, require revving to the redline, sidestepping the clutch, and then holding the redline on every shift. By the way, launching this car that quickly, besides being hard on the clutch, is very difficult to accomplish smoothly. City driving is a joke, as the S2000 requires much hand holding to dart in and out of traffic effectively. Keeping the engine boiling for launch-power in bumper-to-bumper traffic gets real old, real fast. Even at the track, where F1 style piston speeds and screaming rev capabilities are desirable, unless you know how to heel-toe effectively, you will not have the power you need to pull out of turns with any real speed.

Admittedly, the S2000 is a novel piece of engineering and interesting table conversation, but I am neither patient enough, nor capable enough to spend the effort finding power in a car. I want my torque, and I want it now, damn it! I have never been against engaging automobiles that make you want to work to see them perform, but the S2000 goes beyond this, making trips to the market more of a bother than a challenge. Perhaps I wouldn�t be so quick to fault the Honda roadster if there were not already more capable cars out there to choose from. Honda likes to claim a base price of $32K even. My local Honda dealer told me that in exchange for a test drive, I would have to sign a paper agreeing to pay their asking price of $36,900, if I decided to buy it (I said forget it!). With options, and taxes, loaded S2000�s are creeping up near the $40,000 mark. Admittedly, this price gets you some nice items, such as wind deflectors, leather, the usual power convenience functions, xenon headlamps, anti-theft, and a limited slip differential (which helps to keep power at the right wheels). In this price bracket, however, buyers may want to consider the BMW Z3 3.0i, Chevrolet Corvette, Audi TT Roadster, and even the Porsche Boxster. All of these cars offer the above mentioned features plus more. Also, they produce 61-222 more pound feet of torque, and at 3-4000 revolutions sooner, making them substantially more pleasant to drive (track or street). Plus, they have features such as mid engine balance (Porsche), all-wheel-drive (Audi), and a rear-mounted transaxle (Corvette). Still too much money for ya? Fine, the lowest cost Z3, the 2.5i, makes more torque sooner, is almost as quick, and retails for about $31K. Even the little Mazda Miata gets it�s torque more quickly (though less), and has a similar power/weight ratio and a 6-speed gear box. Factor into this equation, a plastic rear window with no defrost, cautious styling, and a drab interior, and you may begin to wonder what the draw is other than the technological wizardry � which is questionable anyhow. It could also be argued that all of these cars are better looking and more unique than the little Honda. 
  
There is simply a lot of hype surrounding the Honda S2000, and I feel that someone should speak up on behalf of the buying public. Variable valve timing is improving substantially, I have seen as much. In the future, the smooth power delivery and readily available torque will come. For now, though, the automotive reviewers that are being so vocal about this car are all gear heads, so naturally a quality Honda delivering race track performance at a budget price � is tops on their lists of �must haves�. But for normal, and even enthusiast driving, the Honda feels an awful lot like the far less expensive Civic Si, which is no slouch, but cannot hang with a Boxster. What the car mags see is a sexy ragtop that makes high revs and lusty sounds. What consumer�s will see is an average roadster with no pick-up, and a noisy, disappointment of an engine.
