            I recently received the Cannon A-50 as a gift and found it to be a great digital camera.  It was very light weight, took extremely clear pictures -whether close up or distant.  The directions were easy to follow and make picture taking a snap.

There are some down sides to this camera.  First, all you receive is a nonrechargable battery, (Mine hasn't died yet, but it slowing down after abut 100 &quot;large&quot; pictures) and wires to hook up to a television or computer.  A separate battery pack (charger, rechargable battery, and AC capabilities) costs $100 and is definitely needed, however, it had to be ordered from Cannon.  Why?  Because no stores in our area carry digital camera accessories of this type - Columbus, OH.  Unbelievable that they would sell the camera but none of the accessories.

Another problem, it is not good for quick action shots.  You have to press the button, then wait 1 or 2 seconds before the picture is actually taken.  It appears to be more of a posing camera.

I would nevertheless recommend this camera.  It is a great beginning tool for learning about digitals. <br><br>
