            Pros: Excellent family size car for those on a tight budget

Cons: It has the stigma of being a poor mans car with no real         
      attention getting outer body style

The body style of the 1996 Corolla has a better look than the newer Corolla, but, overall, it is still the best car when it comes down to needing something that is reliable and does not put a hole in your pocket book.

I have owned five (5) vehicles in my time(1984 Honda Civic CRX, 1991 Mitsubishi Mirage, 1994 Geo Prizm LSI (which I am told is the same as a Corolla), and two Corollas ( 1996 and a 1998).  These cars does not compare to the Corolla.  Here is why.  The Honda line is too expensive for budget conscious persons like me.  Although Honda makes a good car,  in order for a person that is thinking budget to get a Honda is to purchase the Hatchback, inwhich you would have a hard time seating a family of four with one of the four to be a 6 month old infant.  I had so many engine problems with the Mirage.  I vowed to never buy another one.  First of all, it has no weight on the road.  The styling looks good but it drives cheap.  The Prizm was a very good car, even though it appears to be just another corolla.  But, why would they make a Corolla and put a Chevy logo on it.  It does not feel like a Corolla.  I guess it must be mental(laugh)!  I enjoyed both of my Corrolas.  But I liked the body styling of the 1996 better than the newer version.  They both felt good on the road.  The only thing is this.  The more I drove the 1998, it began to make a funny noise from the engine.  In other words, it was louder than I thought a Corolla should have been.  Words of caution!!!!!!!!!!!   Never ever wreck a Corolla.  It never drives the same.

Enjoy

P.S.  It's nice to see all of the extras on the 2000 Corolla <br><br>
