            I just recently bought a 1998 Nissan Maxima SE from a Nissan dealer in Little Rock, Arkansas.  We actually went to try and find a 2000 SE program car, but they didn�t have any.  So, I started looking at the lease cars that had been turned back in after three years.  They made us a deal that we were both happy with, so I drove it off the lot.

I had been driving my wife�s 1995 Nissan Altima because I take our 8-month-old twins to day care every day.  She had been driving my 1991 Mustang GT and hated it (I can�t figure out why because I still like it, but�).  She was ready for me to get a new car so she could have her car back.

This particular car has everything I could want in a family car.  It is a 5-speed, which I really wanted.  It has all of the standard equipment like power doors, power windows, tilt steering, cruise control, etc.  But, it also has some of the extra options such as: power drivers seat, power sunroof, leather interior, and a Bose stereo with CD player.

The 1998 Nissan Maxima has a 6-cylinder engine that has 190 horsepower.  It has quite a bit of get up and go (it won�t run with my Mustang, but it�s not bad), which I also really like.   The wheels are 16 inch five start rims.  The tire size is 215/55/16.  I think the tires that came on the car are VR rated, but I�m not sure.  

I have only had this car for a few days, but I already love it.  It is very comfortable to drive and is a fun car that is big enough for an entire family.  I can easily fit the two car seats in the back seat without jeopardizing my space in the front seat.  

The retail price of these cars today are around $20,000 according to Kelly Blue Book www.kbb.com.  If you shop around, you can get one for less than this�I guarantee it, I did.  According to Kelly Blue Book, I got a pretty good deal on this car.  When a Nissan is turned back in from a lease, the car goes to the company and then to a dealer-only auction.  If a dealer gets a good deal on a car, many times you can also get a good deal on it.  The dealer will be more willing to drop the price to make a quick sale.

One of the best things I bought was an extended warranty.  Nissan offers a 7 year, 100,000 mile bumper to bumper warrantee.  If anything goes wrong in the next 5 years or 75,000 miles, it is covered.  I�ll have it paid off by then and it won�t be as big a deal to have something fixed.  

The 1998 Nissan Maxima is one of the best cars on the road for your money.  You are almost guaranteed to get 200,000 miles from a Maxima, which is better than most other cars can say.  

I love my Maxima and if you are in the market for a new car and don�t want to spend more than $20,000, I would highly suggest trying to find a 1998 Nissan Maxima that has been turned in from a previous lease.
