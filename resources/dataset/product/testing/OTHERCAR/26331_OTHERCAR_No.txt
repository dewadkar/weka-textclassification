            On August 1, 1997 I bought the above vehicle from a Chevy dealer  On September 6, 2000, it developed the serious defect of abruptly shifting from 1st to 2nd gear after approximately 30 minutes or 17 to 20 miles of driving. 
Upon, taking it to the dealer, I was informed that I needed a transmission replacement at a cost of an estimated $1800 dollars, which I was forced to pay $1823.99 to get my car back in a drivable condition.  Dealer service invoice is attached. 
The warranty has recently expired but I believe I should still entitled to a free repair because the existence of such a serious defect in a car, which has only done just over 48,000 miles, indicates it was not of acceptable quality when I bought it.  Several independent transmission shops have confirmed this opinion.  It is obvious that if the public knew that this vehicle's transmission had a tendency to fail at 48,000 mile, Chevrolet would not be able to sell this Van. 
Ordinary wear and tear could not account for this problem so soon in the life of the vehicle.  I am a careful and conscientious owner as the general condition of the car shows.  I also have ensured that all periodic servicing has taken place as listed in the owner's manual.  I have not done anything to the car to cause this defect.
After, returning from the dealer, I did research and found this exact problem had visibility though several different entries on the Department of Transportation's NHTSA web site database, (http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/problems/complain/compmmy2.cfm) for both the 1997 Chevrolet Astro and GMC Safari.  I also have reason to believe that Chevrolet has issued a technical service bulletin on this problem for the installed transmission.

To date, I have not been reembursed by Chevy for this problem.

Another common problem is excessive front tire wear and uneven weare.

Do not buy this van.  You do not need a pay for a new transmission while still paying on your car loan.  GM vehicles have one of the worst warranties in the buisiness.
