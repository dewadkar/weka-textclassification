            I received the Photosmart 215 (215 from here on out) as a gift a Christmas ago (2002). I was new to the digital camera scene, and didn't want to spend an arm and a leg on a digicam. The 215 was at the time, the cheapest camera available. It is very simple to use, and takes decent pictures.
This camera is not very substantial (by substantial I mean feeling well built and easily held, as well as quality of parts). When I opened the box, the plastic LCD screen cover was lying on the bottom of the box, off of the camera! That's right, it fell off during shipping! I tried to call HP and let them know, but I got an earful about the serial number not identified, so I decided to just tape it on with double sided tape.
The 1.3 MegaPixel image sensor may seem plenty, and it is suitable for emailing and websites, but not for hanging over your fireplace. If you have your own personal website, and love to upload pictures, 1.3 mp will suit you fine. The images are small in file size, so they will load quickly.
This camera only has a 2X digital zoom. This is fine for quick snapshots and such, but not for zooming in on a bird in the air. Digital zoom means the camera basically makes the pixels larger, to give the illusion of zooming in. That may seem OK, but it reduces image quality somewhat.
As for the 4MB flash card, this only holds about 5 pics at the highest setting (1600X1200 reso), 10 images at second highest (1024X768) and 32 at lowest (640X480). 4MB is not that much, but for an entry-level camera such as this, it may be enough for the beginner. For emails and website postings (the two things this camera does well), the amount of storage should be sufficient.
The camera only has four buttons/switches: the shutter release, the shoot/review mode switch, the LCD on/off switch, and the Menu jog/selection wheel. It is a very easy camera to learn in a few seconds. My mother, who can't even turn on a computer, uses my 215 as her main camera (she takes out the CF card and gets the images printed out at Wal Mart).
I hate to sound like I don't like this camera, because I do, I used it for over 2 years, before getting a Kodak.
At a time when digicams went for over $500, $130 seemed like a good deal. In today's terms, this would be the equivalent of a $1000 Plasma TV, when good Plasma's are going for well over $4000. You will lose some "gee-whiz" features, but overall, combining price and features, it's a good deal.
