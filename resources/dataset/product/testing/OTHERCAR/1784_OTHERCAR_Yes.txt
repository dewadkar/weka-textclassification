            My daughter moved overseas and wanted a digital camera in order to email pictures.  The cost ($149.99) and the resolution 1024x720 sounded excellent.

My daughter now sends me pictures regularly and they are outstanding! At the highest resolution the pictures are excellent but the file is almost too large to send over internet.  I don't notice that the pictures degrade at the lower resolution.

Downloading the pictures from the camera seems easy even for someone without a lot of computer experience. Once the camera is hooked to the computer pictures can be deleted or saved with ease.  The software provided is easy to use and intuitive.

The only feature it lacks is the ability to review the picture on the camera. But... for the price its worth it!
