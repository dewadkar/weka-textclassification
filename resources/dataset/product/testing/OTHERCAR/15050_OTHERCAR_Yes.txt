            Recently, I purchased a Sony Mavica FD73.  It was my choice because of the ease of using a floppy disk.  

I purchased it to use primarily to take pictures of items which I planned to sell on EBay.  However, I have found it to be absolutely wonderful for so many things.  We are having a new home built and it is grand to be able to take the photos of the progress and send them on to family members.  We had our children and grandchildren here over the holidays and it was lovely to be able to record our activities and send them on to those family members who were not able to be with us.

The camera is very simple to use and the resulting photos are excellent.

I think this camera would be a good choice for anyone.  The ease of operation and the cost make it an ideal selection for someone who is just beginning their adventure into digital photography.  However, the quality of the photos are certainly good enough to please the more experienced photographer.

I would recommend buying an extra battery to have on hand so that you needn't have a &quot;down&quot; time.
