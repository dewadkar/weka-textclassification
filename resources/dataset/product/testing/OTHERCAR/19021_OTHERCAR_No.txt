            I sold my 1989 Subaru Justy because of the birth of my son in 1991. Biggest mistake I ever made!

This Mercury Topaz had problems from almost day one. Unfortunately, because it was a used car I couldn't take it back to the dealer� 
I did buy a 3 year, 30,000 mile warranty and I believe the warranty use and the money I shelled out for this car was 3 times, what it was ever worth. 

Within the 6 months, I had to have the engine replaced, transmission fixed, the muffler fell off (which is not cheap� it is not like normal mufflers where you just buy the muffler.  This also included the pipe which was welded on to the muffler) and I had to get the front and back U-joints, Axle rods, and struts replaced, due to Ford deciding this was not a car who's rear-end could be fixed easily.

I thought I was out of the woods. How wrong I was. 
Within the next 5 years (my husband would not let me sell it because of the excellent 4 wheel drive) I replaced the u-joints and struts yearly, the radio went out, the speedometer fried, the muffler had to be re-done every 12-15 months or it would fall off and the 4 wheel drive went out twice. 
 
Sad to say I've met two other Topaz owners and both had at least as many problems as I had or more! I would not recommend this car to anyone. I've gone back to Subaru� an older model� 1988 that works like a charm.
