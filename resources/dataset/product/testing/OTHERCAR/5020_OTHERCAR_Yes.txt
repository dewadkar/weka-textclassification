            This digital camera is an excellent camera for the price. It is a 2.1 mega pixel camera, with avi capabilities (short cam-like movies). Just the right length for an email send. You just put camera on motion picture mode, push the button to begin, then push it again to stop. It will take a series of super fast shots to produce the movie shorts. The full card display will show when you have filled up the card.

Like all good digital cameras, this one has several quality modes to select from. The high quality mode offers the fewest shots, while the least in quality allows for many more photos. The quality of the photos are excellent, and the digital zoom can be enlarged 2X, 3X, or 4X. 

The Ricoh 6000 has several bonus features, besides the avi ability. The rechargable battery, battery charger, and a nice carrying case comes with this camera (these usually cost extra with other digitals). It also comes with the necessary hookups for your pc, plus a cable to hook it directly to the T.V. You can also view the pictures on the camera's LCD screen.

Installing the software is simple, and the downloads are very easy to do. 
It has some very nice programs in the software package for your photos.
The cost runs around $400 to $450. An excellent price for all the features it has. A lot more expensive camera's do not offer what the Ricoh 6000 gives you.
