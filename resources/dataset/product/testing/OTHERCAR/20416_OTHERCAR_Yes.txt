            I've always liked the VW Jetta line, but when the body styling was redesigned in 1999, I fell in love.

In December of 1999, I purchased a 2000 model Jetta GLX V6 sedan.  For those of you unfamiliar with the GLX, this model comes standard with a full leather interior, wood trim, heated seats and mirrors, 16&quot; alloy wheels, and the smooth V6 engine.

My dealer was fairly cooperative and the purchase went painlessly.

Well, it's been a year since I purchased the car, so I've had plenty of time to abuse it.  Here are my conclusions:

CONSTRUCTION

Rock solid.  The Jetta feels like a tank.  Everything fits together tightly and the doors (and trunk) give a satisfying &quot;clunk&quot; when you shut them, ensuring that you are sealed in for an air-tight ride.  Quality abounds.  Even after a year, the wood trim and black leather are just as vibrant as the day I picked it up from the showroom.

The front seat cup holder is an innovative design, but lacks solid construction.  I actually managed to knock it loose on one particular occasion.  Fortunately, it was easy enough to reseat.

COMFORT

I've managed to take multiple 3+ hour road trips in this car and I have little to complain about.  The leather seats are quite comfortable and all of the accessory controls are placed within easy reach of the driver.  On the rare occasion that I have back seat passengers, it becomes apparent that this is one of the Jetta's downfalls.  There simply is not much leg room in the back seat.  If you plan on taking multiple passengers on a regular basis, this could become quite annoying.  I'm sure you'll find that your potential passengers will make every effort to &quot;call shotgun&quot;.

The trunk is simply HUGE, providing plenty of space for even your most extreme shopping sprees.  I'm a skier, so I can appreciate cargo room.  The back seats do fold down to accommodate long or odd sized cargo.

Speaking of skiing, the heated seats and mirrors on the GLX are heavenly in cold weather.  There's nothing like settling in to a warm leather seat after a long day on the slopes.

FEATURES

There are literally hundreds of cool features on the Jetta GLX, so I'm only going to highlight those that stand out to me.  

Factory fog lights are another feature that come standard on the GLX.  If find myself using these on a daily basis.  They are both attractive and functional, what more could you ask for?  The trunk and gas flap release levers are both lockable from the interior of the vehicle.  The rear seats are lockable, as well, in order to prevent access to the trunk, in the event that the car is broken in to.

Of course, all Jettas come with a built-in security system, which includes a device that disables the vehicle when an attempt is made to start it without a key.  This system is controlled by the unique &quot;flip-key&quot; remote that is now provided with all new VW vehicles.

My GLX came with a factory installed CD changer in the trunk, which works wonderfully.  I went back to the dealer, however, and had them install an additional factory in-dash CD player, which works in conjunction with the changer in the trunk.  Speaking of the trunk, in addition to being roomy, it has some great features as well.  There are multiple A/C lighter adapters in the trunk.  I have mounted a power converter to one of these adapters to give me 2 standard 120V outlets in my trunk.  VW was really thinking when they installed the lighter adapters there.  They are really quite functional!  There are also multiple stainless steel tie-down rings in the trunk to assist in tying down heavy or awkward cargo loads.

I could literally go on for several pages describing the host of features found of the Jetta (sunroof, digital dash, etc..), but I'll stick to the review.  Check out VW's homepage for a full list.

DRIVING

I've always liked to drive, but after purchasing this car, I've become a driving enthusiast!  Over 17,000 miles have been put on my Jetta in a year's time.  The car excels at cornering and quite literally &quot;hugs&quot; turns.  I can't say enough about the VW V6 engine.  If you are considering a Jetta, I highly suggest that you pay a little extra to take home a V6 model.  You will not regret it.  The Jetta is a speedy car with the standard engine, so it's easy to imagine how it really purrs with the V6.

The Jetta handles very well in snow.  I've used this vehicle to take ski trips several times and it's never let me down.  The excellent steering and anti-traction controls make the Jetta a formidable sedan for virtually any driving environment.

WARRANTY

I opted to purchase the 10 year/100K mile warranty with my vehicle, but Jetta does cover your vehicle's maintenance and repairs for the first 20K miles.  As a neat bonus, they pay for your regularly scheduled maintenance during this time (oil changes, tune ups).  I've had my vehicle into the shop a couple of times for minor problems.  The maintenance was always performed quickly and without and hassle at all.  If you are a Washington resident, I highly recommend Auburn Subaru/VW for both the purchase and upkeep of your Jetta.  I have been extremely impressed with their service.

CONCLUSION

I am beyond pleased with my purchase of a 2000 Jetta GLX.  Aside from a couple of minor issues, the rear seat leg room is the only factor that might turn some buyers away from this car.  In all other respects, the GLX (and Jettas in general) represent an excellent value in automotive engineering.<br><br>
