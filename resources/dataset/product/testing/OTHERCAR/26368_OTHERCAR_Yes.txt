              I recently purchased a 1999 GMC Jimmy SLE.  This is my first SUV and was a great choice.  After looking at many different choices, I decided this was the best for the money.  The Jimmy is a very smooth ride for a SUV and has many great features.  The universal transmitter in the overhead console is a great idea.  I have yet to try the 4wd but I will surely have a chance this winter.  Even though I had heard from other people that the Jimmy was sluggish during acceleration, mine is more than quick enough for a SUV.  Very happy with this purchase and will probably upgrade to a newer model in a few year.
