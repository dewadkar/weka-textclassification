            My 1993 Pontiac Sunbird is the third car I have ever owned in my life. I accquired the car in the spring of 1999 and have put over 10,000 miles on it so far. What do I like and not like about this car? Read on and find out...

<b>The car itself:</b>
  My particular vehicle is the LE 4-door version. The car is listed as being silver, but it looks gray to me. I have customized the car itself, adding the trendy fuzzy dice and the hip front license plate.

<b>What I like:</b>
  Being a college student, I have had to move back and forth from the dorms to my parents house many time. This car gets the job done in only two trips at most. I may not have as much stuff as other people, but what I got can fit in the trunk and in the back seat (not to mention a few things piled in the front passenger seat). While at college, I do not drive around alot, so I save on gas, which is cool knowing that my car does not use up alot anyways. 

<b>What I do not like:</b>
  So many problems! My first ever breakdown on the side of the road event happened with this car. It was a leak in the coolant line, and I sat overheated on the side of the road one July evening. From that adventure I journeyed into the deep dark depths of the engine light fiasco. On a long road trip with my girlfriend (ex now for all you single ladies!) my engine light repeatedly flickered on and off for over 200 miles. Recently, the problem was solved with the replacement of the oxygen sensor (what is that?). 

<b>Conclusion</b>
  If you must, take this car and treat it like your firstborn child. With a good home, this car can be reliable and driven for years. A few problems here and there, but what in life is perfect?
