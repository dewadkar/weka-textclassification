             This camera takes very good, quality pictures. The pictures that you can print immediately on the Olympus' printing feature are not of the best quality but it's still a nice idea. Some people want instant gratification so they like this. I like being able to give people who I know I won't see again or who don't have email, a picture that they can take with them.  The biggest problem that I have with the camera is that it is HUGE. It is like the size of a 5 by 7 picture. It is also kinda heavy. The film for the camera is $10 at any pharmacy or grocery store or Walmart type store. It is kind of expensive but for me I don't use that feature much so it hasn't really cost me anything.  The details of the camera are: 2.1 megapixel CCD for 1,600 x 1,200 images, 3x optical lens zoom, 2-inch LCD monitor. The C-211 Zoom lets you dial-in color and make tonal adjustments.  The other con to owning this camera is that it takes 4 AA batteries and they do NOT last long at all. If you use the camera a lot, for example you sell stuff on EBAY and you are taking pictures every day, then these batteries are only going to last you about 3 hours time. I use the expensive batteries too! Well, other than the size and the batteries I love my OLYMPUS DIGITAL PRINTING 211 camera. I forgot to add, I paid about $340.00 for my camera but I bought it on EBAY. I believe that these cameras retail for $599.
