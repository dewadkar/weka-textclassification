            Nissan Pathfinders are great cars.Good looking,reliable,sporty,and the most important safe! Those are just a few adjectives that describe this great car.I have gotten tons of good compliments on my Nissan Pathfinder.It is a 96, dark blue,4x4,and has a brush guard on it.Not only can you go off road with your Nissan Pathfinder, you can also drive around town or cross country. You can purchase a Nissan Pathfinder with either manual or automatic. I for one bought a manual and it drives great. The only thing that i dislike about my car is the gas mileage . It gets sixteen miles per gallon which is not very good . But, that is my only complaint about my Nissan Pathfinder<br><br>
