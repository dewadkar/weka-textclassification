            I purchased my 1991 Mercury Sable LS with power everything, cruise control, electronic climate control, air bag, premium stereo and with only 32000 original miles.  I had been looking for a good used car to replace my 93 Ford Escort for quite some time.  I just never found anything with the low miles and a price I could afford.  That was until I came across a small used car dealer in town.  When I first saw the car I almost passed it up until I saw the window sticker out of the corner of my eye which listed the original mils as 32200.  I had to take another look.  After test driving the car and checking it over I made an offer of $4000.00 for the car.  Now some of you might think $4000.00 for a 10 year old car is a bit high.  Not for this one everything is factory original and the car looks as if it just drove off the show room floor.  

This is the best driving car I have ever owned and with all of the luxury features in it it is also real fun to drive.  The car a some pickup top it also which is surprising considering how large it is.  I love all the power options but my favorite option is the climate control system.  Just punch in how cool you want the car to be put it on automatic cooling and it will keep the inside of the car a constant temperature.  Also the power seats with Lumbar support are the most comfortable I have ever sat in for a vehicle.  The car is very roomy and comfortable.

The only thing I am a bit disappointed in is the sound system.  The Sable has the optional premium sound but it sure does not seem very premium to me though.  

Anyway great car and an even greater buy.
