            As I compared cars in October of 1993 I set my sight on the Prizm.  The great Lexus-looking design made an immediate impact on me.  All that remained to be learned was how it would hold up and react years later.  I am proud to say that the car has been great in all but one area, interior trim.  This is a common problem with the 93 models and was pretty much &quot;fixed&quot; in 94+ models.  My problem now is what to replace it with!  The newer Prizm models are stodgy in looks and presents nothing more than a middle-of-the-pack performance in 2000.  Rumor has it that the 2001 models are going back into the &quot;better looking&quot; category.  If the 2001 Toyota is an example, you may want to purchase another car.  I guess we'll have to wait and see.  4.5/5 stars for me.<br><br>
