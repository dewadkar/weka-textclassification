            I bought my 1995 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme ( a.k.a. &quot;BabyCar&quot;) in the Fall of 1998.  She was three years old and had about 60,000 on her.  I am a 23 year old single mother, so I wanted something quick, safe, and stylish.  I shopped around for both new and used cars.  I looked at the Cutlass because of the utterly different body style.  You see a Cutlass, you KNOW it's a Cutlass.  I wasn't finding the features I needed in the newer cars without overspending my budget, so when I found BabyCar I was pleasantly amazed.  I took her for a test drive, and fell in love immediately.  The car has these great bucket seats, they are incredibly soft &amp; comfy.  The whole car is blue with black trim, even the dash lights are blue.  When you turn on the parking and fog lights, and stand directly in front of the car, she looks like a spaceship.  She is loaded, with a moonroof, power everything, trunk release, cruise control, tinted windows, fog lights, AND remote keyless entry.  I found those remotes in the glovebox, and I was sold.  I have owned that car for two years now, and I have not once had to take her in for repairs.  I am religious about her oil changes, but I am not the most careful driver.  She has been on (and off) some bumpy roads, yet still rides like a dream.  I like the power, especially for the size of the car.  She will definitely get up and go.  She is a little cumbersome in tight spots, but her reliability and style more than make up for the deficiency.  I love that car.<br><br>
