            My fiance's relationship with his 1993 Lincoln Mark VIII preceded his relationship with me by two years, and both the car and myself are still hanging around and if I say so myself, still looking good!  Although he is the primary driver of the car, I also enjoy driving it occasionally - it is always a treat even though my car is four years newer and has similar (although lesser in quality) features. 

What do I <b>like</b> about this vehicle?

1. sleek, narrow profile/different look when compared to other luxury cars of its size

2. easy maneuverability: this contrasts strongly with my car's handling (see my review regarding this). This car makes very tight, precise turns and is easy to park.

3. smooth leather interior, including heated seats 

4. seating presets that can be set for the primary and secondary drivers of the car (important for me as I am only 5'1&quot; tall, so I always have quite a few adjustments to make - this saves time in that once you have gotten the settings right, you don't have to redo it)

5. numeric key pad for door locking/unlocking - helpful if you have locked your keys in the car as you will never have this problem again with this feature

6. decent gas mileage considering that it has an eight cylinder engine


What do I <b>dislike</b> about this vehicle?

1.  no cupholders (a must in any vehicle I drive, as I am always drinking coffee or soda on the road)

2.  small trunk (low height-wise but it is deep)
