            Although I've had a lot of fun over the past year and a half with my Ford Escort ZX2, my Wife has decided it's time for me to get something else. Indeed, she figures that we have a three-year-old son and a daughter on the way, so Daddy needs a larger vehicle. Although I'll miss my little &quot;sports coupe,&quot; I can't argue with her logic.

So, I've decided one of those small sports utility vehicles might be nice. I've driven small cars for too long (the largest car I've owned over the past three years was a Ford Contour) to get a larger SUV, and those &quot;miniature&quot; ones look nifty. After test-driving a Kia Sportage, I couldn't decide whether I liked the vehicle or not. So, after reading some things about the Grand Vitara, I headed to the nearest Suzuki lot to see one for myself.

Initially, I noticed this was a nice looking vehicle. The thing looks solid and a bit sporty, yet has enough room to haul around a family. I talked to a salesman, and wound up looking at a JLX+ which has a little bit of everything for around $22,000. That's not a bad price, so I took a peak at the features on this vehicle. It's got a strong 2.5 liter, DOHC V-6 which pumps out 155 horses. Also, there's power windows, locks, etc., and an AM/FM stereo (naturally) with cassette AND a six-disc CD changer. I love the idea of having both a cassette player and CD changer as I am a fan of &quot;old time&quot; radio, and have a lot of cassettes. Hey, there's nothing better than a few hours of &quot;Jack Benny&quot; or &quot;Burns &amp; Allen&quot; while on a long trip, so don't laugh. The model I looked at, of course, also came with four-wheel drive.

This vehicle looks great. I loved the looks of it. I loved the way it drove and behaved. I loved how easy it was to engage the four-wheel drive system. Before I get into all that, though, let me mention why I will probably never own this vehicle.

I decided to borrow a Grand Vitara for a day and test-drive it. The one I looked at was a very striking silver color, and the salesman tossed me the keys. I opened the door and noticed a problem.

&quot;Hey, uh, can I get one of these with a standard?&quot; I asked.

&quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;Well, you know, a standard. A stick. I want a five-speed,&quot; I replied.

The salesman looked at me like I was nuts. He then explained to me why I really wanted an automatic transmission. He said the standard was not necessary on the V-6 because, unlike a lowly four-banger, the six put out enough power to do quite well with an automatic.

&quot;Do you have a standard or not?&quot; I asked.

The salesman kind of sniffed and explained that they don't get those trucks with five-speeds that often as &quot;everyone&quot; preferred the automatic transmission. He said the automatic, too, was great in that it's computer-assisted and can be set to shift for &quot;optimal&quot; power or economy. I prefer good ol' &quot;arm assisted&quot; shifting as I love to wind up that tach and shift when I damn well feel like it. I don't like a machine deciding when it's time to change gears, but my opinion on this point didn't seem to matter. I, after all, was just the customer who was considering purchasing a $22,000 vehicle. How much, after all, did my opinion count?

Well, I was told I could get a four-banger with a standard, but a V-6 with one was hard to find. That's just great. Thanks a lot. The salesman could have been lying through his teeth about all this, but I figure that doesn't matter. The dealerships chosen to sell a particular brand of vehicle says quite a bit about the manufacturer, right?

Well, I decided to take the vehicle for a test-drive and I kept it with me for the better part of a day and drove it all over the place (I love those weekends -- plenty of time to goof off and have fun). This vehicle has a lot of good things to offer.

First of all, that engine is strong and just sends this ride zipping down the road. Once I got over cursing the fact that the blasted thing was shifting itself, I paid attention to the power put out by the V-6 and was impressed. This machine does not lack for power, and the engine was responsive. I hated the transmission, but I'll talk about that later.

The handling, too, was good. Unlike the Kia, I didn't feel like this thing would tump over unless I did something very dramatic. The Grand Vitara, indeed, was very nimble and weaving in and out of traffic was a joy.

The ride was fantastic and quiet. The vehicle took bumps in the road very well, and the interior blocked out wind-noise and allowed for easy conversation in town and on the Interstate. The interior, too, was spacious and comfortable, although the back seat is a bit cramped for adults. Storage space was adequate, although I wouldn't plan on slinging too much gear in this vehicle. The seats were comfortable, the carpet was durable and the whole interior was designed well.

In fact, this vehicle just felt, well, &quot;solid&quot; for want of a better word. The SUV feels like some real attention was paid to the quality of construction, and I noticed no rattles or anything annoying like that. Whether the thing will creek or rattle over time, I have no idea -- I only had it for one day, after all.

The four-wheel drive system was easy to engage. Just shift and you're there. I'll have to admit I didn't do much off-roading (I drove across a flat field and down a dirt road, but that's not much of a test), but the thing &quot;pulled&quot; well when four-wheel drive was engaged, if that means anything.

And then, we get to the transmission. I know a lot of people love those automatic transmissions. My Wife loves her's. I used to enjoy them. I'd rather have a standard, though. Perhaps I'm strange, but an automatic feels &quot;sluggish&quot; to me anymore, and I tend to wish they'd wind-up the tach a bit more before shifting. I just prefer the &quot;feel&quot; of a standard, and find it strange that I couldn't drive a Grand Vitara equipped with one.

The automatic in the Grand Vitara, in spite of the fancy-pants, computer-assisted shifting, felt about like every automatic transmission I've ever owned. It was &quot;whiny&quot; and sluggish. There's nothing special about that transmission -- there's just a switch to flip to &quot;force&quot; it to shift for economy or power. Each setting felt the same to me. Yawn.

The Suzuki homepage says a standard is &quot;standard equipment,&quot; but that particular salesman suggested otherwise.

So, while I enjoyed my time with the Suzuki, I probably won't get one unless I can try out one with a five-speed and decide from there. I've just about decided it's a conspiracy -- my experience in finding a suitable SUV has not gone that well, and I believe there's a plot to get me to purchase a Saturn like my Wife did. I enjoy her Saturn. I like the Saturn lot in town. I bet they'd let me buy one with a five-speed if I asked them.<br><br>
