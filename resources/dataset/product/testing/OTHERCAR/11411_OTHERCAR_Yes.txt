            The Toyota 4runner is a great car.  I recently bought a SUV because I felt it was the perfect combination of safety, utility, and luxury for my family.  I chose the 4Runner over its competition for important reasons that have not disappointed.

Number one is the quality associated with the Toyota name.  The 4Runner is an exceptional car -- no flaws, no problems, and still quiet as a whisper, even after over 40,000 miles (note, this is a 2000 model).

The second reason I chose the 4Runner was for its features and ruggedness.  Given the many &quot;mini&quot; SUVs, such as the Subaru OutBack and the Toyota Rav4, there were many cars that could have satisfied my requirements.  However, none could have met them as completely as the 4Runner.  The 4Runner is large enough to fit my entire family with equipment.  Its size and height also lends to a feeling of safety -- being above the impact level of other cars and having the weight and momentum to not be demolished if an accident occurred with other large cars.  But the best part of the 4Runner is its ruggedness.  You can take this car anywhere!!  Hiking, skiing, rock climbing, it doesn't matter, the 4Runner makes a simple feat of transportation in uninviting terrains.

Handling is another plus for the 4Runner.  Its suspension is soft and car-like on city roads.  When in mountainous terrain, the ride is a little bumpy and the suspension a little stiff (if you plan for more rugged driving, you can adjust your shocks).  

However, this may not be the car for everyone.  It is more expensive than other mini SUVs and its gas mileage, while comparable to its competition, is still not that great.  All in all, a great car which I highly recommend to anyone looking for a new or used full sized SUV.  I suggest taking a test drive to get a feel for the car -- you'll understand where I'm coming from then.
