            I had previously owned a 1988 Honda Accord before I bought the 1990 Accord that I currently own. When the 88 Accord reached 250,000 miles I decided that it was time to put it to rest. I was very pleased to have sold it for $1,200 after having it in the paper for only one day. All in all it was a very good car for the 2 years I had owned it. My mother had previously owned it and took good care of it so I'm sure that helped a lot. Now I own a 1990 Accord that I bought just over a year ago. It has cost me so much money in repairs so far that I could have put the money towards a 2000 Accord. I have been to the shop to have struts, springs, and the CV axels replaced along with the new tires that the broken springs wore out. Since that spurt of problems I have been back for break problems. The rotors had to be replaced (They were the originals). Honda installs the rotors behind the ball bearings using a machine for this year of car, making the cost a lot higher than normal rotor replacement. A transmission cable had to be replaced, and most currently, the driver side door will no longer open. I have also replaced the alternator twice during my ownership time. My previous Honda also went through two alternators while I owned it. I have brought the car to a trusted mechanic who has told me that most of these repairs are typical for a 10 year old Honda. On the other hand I love everything else about it. with my last Honda, and this one I never have worried about breaking down on the road having taken them on multiple successful trips over 300 miles each time. The front is roomy, but the back has to sacrifice a little leg room. The trunk also has decent cargo space. Hopefully these typical Honda problems are fixed and over because I would like to keep this car. I live in Minnesota and during the early morning -10 degree temperatures, it always starts with out argument. Anybody could enjoy this car from the attractive exterior to easy to keep clean interior. I like camping a lot and can barely fit two people's worth of stuff in it so if your a big traveler this may be little cramped.<br><br>
