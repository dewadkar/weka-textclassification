            The recent issue of Consumer Reports tested this vehicle and scored it the lowest of 5 (including the Toyota Tacoma Crew Cab, the Ford Explorer Sport-Trac, the Dodge Dakota Crew Cab and the Chevy S-10 Crew Cab).  If you read the reviews or have read any of their other truck reviews in the past, it is clear that the good people at Consumer Reports flat don't like trucks at all.  So, one must turn elsewhere for a more appropriate review.

I've had my Nissan Frontier Crew Cab Super-Charged 4X4 for a solid 10,000 miles now and feel that I have really been exposed to this vehicle.  Is it perfect? No.  But it is fun!  A lot of fun!  I have 60 mile roundtrip commute each day and I still look forward to hopping in this truck and driving.  Besides reliability, isn't this the true test of a vehicle?

Let's start at the front of this truck and work our way backwards.  The grille has a neo-industrial look that is very distinctive on the road and is the base of this truck.  The headlights have a 3 light configuration and provide good lighting both on high & low settings.  The fog lights provide good additional coverage.

The 210hp engine provides good acceleration off the line and solid performance at cruising speeds.  The supercharger is a bit whiny, but in an odd way seems to add to the character of the vehicle.  The engine compartment itself is roomy and easy to work in and around.  The lack of an under hood light is disappointing.

All four fenders feature a flared fender wall that matches the body color and has noticeable rivets to lend to the aggressive look.  The standard wheels on the SC edition are 17" alloys.  Mine came with Firestone Firehawk tires which give a smooth, albeit somewhat noisy ride.

The driving position is high and assured and the leather bucket seats provide good support.  The lack of seat adjustability beyond forward/back and recline is a minus.  The leather seats are available only as charcoal in color with red trim. They lend sportiness, though a beige leather option would be a bonus.  The cockpit is simple, clean and well-laid out with the gauges easily readable both for day and night driving.  The gauges are worth a special mention as they are titanium backed, and give an appearance of black numbers on a white background in daytime, and the opposite for night.  

The leather wrapped steering wheel is also home to easily accessible controls for the stereo and cruise control. The tilt control is easily accessible.

The AC/heating system works extremely well in the passenger compartment.  It works so well in fact that you will find yourself making frequent adjustments in both temperature setting and fan speed.

The standard stereo is a 6 Disc in-dash CD changer with AM/FM stereo and 18 presets.  The layout is logical and easy to use, especially so with the aforementioned steering wheel controls.  The RDS data information program is fun to play with and will entertain those who like to frequently hit the FM scan button.  Sound is adjustable with the built in equalizer and seems better overall suited to CD's than radio listening.

The glove box is average in size and the center console, home to two cup holders in both front and back, also provides additional storage.  The door panel stows are a bit skimpy however.

The popup sunroof has a removable sun shade, and the glass can be removed completely after the complex task of removing the roof rack wind sheer.  But, in the popped up position, the sunroof provides excellent ventilation on hot days.

The rear seat is a bit cramped and those adults who have ridden with me have found the headroom to be a bit more cumbersome than the legroom limitations.  The rear bench seat has a bucket like feel for the two primary positions. Children fit comfortably in the back.  You can fit three adults in the back if need be, but I wouldn't recommend it.  On the other hand, this is a truck and not an SUV so if you need passenger room for long hauls, you wouldn't be looking at a truck anyway, now would you?

The bed is short, but the tailgate bed extender adds the overall length of a normal compact pick-up.  On the other hand, if you were looking to do major hauling, you wouldn't be looking at a compact truck.  

The roof rack is stylish and one of the most noticeable aspects of this truck.  Made by Yakima, there are a variety of optional attachments available that will increase the overall flexibility.  The wind sheer up front provides both form and function.

The engine is alive and responds quickly to the touch of the gas pedal.  As noted earlier, it can be a bit whiny at times.  Handling is a bit soft, but once you get the feel, it's confident and assured.  Braking is impressive and reliable.

The truck feels strong and reliable off-road, though its short wheelbase posseses the ups & downs of all compact 4X4's.  Also, you can't shift on the fly into 4WD as is popular these days, but those systems are generally designed for lighter off-road duty anyway.  This truck practically begs for you to get it off the pavement every once in a while.

On the freeway, the road is smooth and supple by truck standards, and on bumpier roads, the road is stable though a bit jarring.  I can't stress enough that the stable yet bumpy ride seems to just contribute to the overall charm of the truck.

Reliability has been outstanding, and other than oil changes, I have not had to take the truck in for any problems.  The integrity of both the interior and exterior has been outstanding.

I test drove each of the same vehicles that Consumer Reports reviewed and I found that they all had the same basic plusses and minuses.  What stands out for me is that this truck is fun to drive.  I look forward to driving it each day!
