            My brother purchased this vehicle at the beginning of winter for the sole reason to keep his wife paranoid driving in the snow wife quiet.  The model purchased is the SE, sports edition, little bit of marketing for you SE just means some running boards and a roof rack and a little silver SE on the tail gate.  This SUV is in a class all on it's own, powerwise you could compare it to mustangs and sports car, the pickup is amazing, off the line and in the straight was 5.0L mustangs are left in the dust.  The interior is very spacious and the seats almost make you fall asleep they are so comfortable, stadium seating in the rear so back seat passengers can see over heads.  With the 4wd package there is no slipping or sliding around corners, it holds still on even the sharpest corners, it's really a peace of mind situation when you sit in this thing you just feel safer.  The sound system is very apparent in this vehicle, Bose 6 speaker system should not be consider stock ever, 6 disc in dash cd changer, with very basic easy to use controls on the dash and and on the steering wheel.  The only draw back is with it's large size and weight it isn't the best on fuel, another problem which may only be an inoslated case is the heat is so power and hot that it ended up cracking the windshield, now warranties do not cover wind shields and estimated cost of a replacement is $900+, so take it easy with the heaters, all in all an excellent rid and you just can't compare it to anything else on the road. <br><br>
