            I have had my Neon for almost 2 yrs. I got rid of a 4 WD Subaru for this car. Since owning it I have been extremely please with the efficiency, gas mileage and handling of the car, I do almost all highway driving and the Neon handles extremely well at higher speeds, plus in stop and go traffic. It is very easy to park in any area. In driving to and from work I see many other small cars that do not seem suited for highway driving, they are all over the road, and have no get up and go to them, where as my Neon does. I do not regret not having the 4 WD that I had for over 10 yrs. because my car handles great in the snow and ice. I was a bit suspicious when I bought this car because of the great price. Now I know that I should have stuck with American made all along.<br><br>
