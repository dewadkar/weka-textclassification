            I did not buy this vehicle, but had to rent it when my car was slightly damaged in an accident and had to be repaired.  

The Dodge Neon did not have much power at all.  I could barely take off from a stop light.  It also seemed to make a lot of noise, especially when first taking off from a complete stop.

The car was also very small.  I am of normal size and had a hard time in the driver compartment.  After driving to work, which is about a 30 to 60 minute commute, I would get out of the car and my back would hurt because the seat was so uncomfortable.  Not only did the little bulge (I guess it was the lumbar support) not match up with my back, but the seat was very hard.  I had to have to seat almost all the way back to properly reach the gas pedal and not hit my knees on the steering wheel.  With the seat that far back, I felt like I was almost sitting in the back seat.  If someone had to sit back there, there would not have been any leg room for them.

I would only recommend this car to a very small person or someone looking for an economy car.<br><br>
