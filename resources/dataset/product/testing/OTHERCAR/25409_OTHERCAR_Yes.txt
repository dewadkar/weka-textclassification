               It is only fitting that Roadiem�s write-off be automotive. I only wish I could give all of you the wonderfully detailed, informative and much needed technical expertise that Mike was so qualified in giving all of us.  Along with a hilarious title and witty writing banter! 

   Due to a shared faith and my trying to start a business with my photos, my husband and I quickly bonded with Mike and felt like �family�, he called me his �little sis� and gave me great tips on my photography needs.  His family is in our prayers and he will be greatly missed. 

(And now, on to my review)
   I apologize in advance if you are looking for technical reasons to buy this car, you may want to read the other Epinions on this subject (especially pipet's) because I have no knowledge of the technical side of cars. But, I really wanted to participate in this special write-off. I hope I can stir some of your own memories of your first car.

   My mind was set. I had read some great reviews and watched some flashy commercials of the �92 Prot�g� and on checking it out I found it to be just right for me. Small but roomy enough to pile three and once, four (although I don�t recommend this) of my friends into the back-seat, automatic front seat-belts that make sure those who do not use them, WILL! An adequate stereo with tape player for my quadzillions of cassettes, a rather large trunk for a smaller car, a beautiful color, a decent, compared with other cars of that same caliber, price; 10,000, and�it was �too cute�. Oh yea, it drove smooth too.

  As the keys were dropped into my hand one word came to my recently turned 18 yr. old mind�FREEEEEDOM!  Remember that feeling? This car was a pre-graduation gift from my dad and let�s face it, besides the diploma, my most prized!  As I belted myself in, took in the new car smell and rolled out of the parking lot with my head up and a big smile on my face, I turned on the radio, full blast of course, and what song would appropriately be playing? �I�ve been waiting for this moment all my life�, O.K. so maybe Phil Collins song, In The Air Tonight, looked more appropriate when Tubs and Crocket were cruising down the freeway on Miami Vice but for me, it FELT the same. My Prot�g� was that popular metallic green that led to many an argument with family and friends on whether it was actually green or �more of a bluish color�, I was determined it was green and I was also determined to take very good care of it! The last few months left of school life I made sure to park it in the very back of the parking lot to ensure safety, of course by the end of the day I was too lazy to walk all the way back there so I would have my friend drive me in his truck to my car, pitiful I know. 

 My car was used quite a lot! In my bible ministry, to school, on the weekends hanging with my friends, trips down the Oregon coast (we live in WA State) and with regular oil changes and care my particular Prot�g� did not give me any problems.  Unfortunately, my car and myself were soon involved in two car accidents. My right side was swiped by an elderly lady during the first accident. At first I was more concerned with her not having a heart attack from fear of her husband and insurance company, then my car.  Once that was taken care of I realized my �baby� had it�s first scratches on it but that was taken care of at the shop and looked good as new when corrected.  My car�s second accident, two months later, was not so kind. My mom was driving and I was a passenger when we were hit head-on by what we used to call, a �hoopty�.  We were not the only ones hurt, this time my car was crunched pretty badly. His car was partly on top of my hood and due to my mom trying to swerve out of the way at the last second, the passenger-side was also damaged from impact. 

 Although my car was fixed from that last accident, it never quite recovered. We continued to take it on trips and use it regularly but it did not have the same power behind it, feeling very sluggish when giving it gas or trying to get up a hill. I began having problems with the suspension and interesting noises that could not be identified. Also, probably because of the particular metallic color that I had loved so much, some of the paint did not take very well and was chipping. 

 A little while after my husband and I were married, he could take it no longer. You see my husband is 6�7 and this Prot�g� did not fit him as it had fit me, his legs were so cramped in my car. So, I had to say good-bye to my first car. It was very sad and I still sigh at the sight of �my car� when I see them driving down the road. I treasure the great pictures I have of the very first day I got it, hanging with my friends, the trips down the Oregon coast, when my husband put wheels on them and before that, the very special day our friends covered it from front to back with balloons, ribbons, cans and the words, �JUST MARRIED� on the windows.  

 Maybe I am biased to all the wonderful memories, achievements and stories attached to this car but I think it was a great car back then and I hope no matter what your first car was, that all of you were able to take some time out to think about some of your own memories.
