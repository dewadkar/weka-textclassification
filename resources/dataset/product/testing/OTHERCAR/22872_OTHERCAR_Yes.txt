            In November of 1993, I purchased a one-owner, 1993 Dodge Shadow 5 door liftback.  It has a 2.2 liter, 4 valve engine.  It came equipped with a 3-speed automatic transmission, antilock brakes, stereo cassette player, and air-conditioning.  I needed a dependable car to drive back and forth to work, especially since I work at night.  

It gets excellent gas mileage, 24 city and 29 highway.  I love the anti-lock brakes.  They work beautifully.  I would not drive a car without them now, as I can stop so gracefully and have been kept from skidding so many times, even when I didn't realize the road was a little slick.  Another feature that I love is the counter balanced hood (no prop rod needed) which makes it so easy to check the engine.

We have had a problem with the paint peeling on the trunk, hood and roof.  On epinions, we have read that there was a problem with the paint on certain Dodges' due to a factory mistake.  To our complete surprise, Dahlmer-Chrysler has agreed to pay our local Dodge body shop the cost of repainting the problem areas and our share will be $100.

The only repairs I have needed to have done was a new valve cover gasket in 1996, at a cost of $95.00, the routine maintenance at different mileages, and recently, front brakes, brake rotor and tie rod end, which cost $297.00.

The Shadow is more comfortable for average size adults in the front and in the back, people under 5' 4&quot;.  The seats could have better lumbar support, but that is one of the few negatives.  It has plenty of storage space, as the back seats fold down.

All in all, it is a great compact car and well worth the purchase price of $12,371.
