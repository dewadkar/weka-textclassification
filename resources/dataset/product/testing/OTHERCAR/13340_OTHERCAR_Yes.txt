            I bought this vehicle right before I went away for college.  I was lucky, it only had 64K miles and one owner.  It was in my price range, and it's just so darn cute!

I love the seats in my car.  Nice durible fabric and it's really comfortable.  The speakers are wonderful, and the acccisories are suberb.  I love the way everything is laid out.
I hate some of the engine problems I am having.  In the last 6 months, I have spent over a thousand dollars on fixing it.  If it's not one thing, it's the other.  I sometimes wonder what the other owner did.   Since it is an American made car, it is easy and cheap to fix.  The vinal siding on the interior is starting to bubble, but that's because it's in direct sunlight all day.  Also, I LOVE the gas milliage.  I am currently getting a little over 30 miles per gallon.  And that is a lifesaver now that gas prices are so high.  However, everything is powered, and that is starting to go.  But you can always lean over to lock the doors!

I like to drive my car because it's so comfy!  I am 5'11&quot; and the leg room and head room are fantastic!  The middle console is perfect to put your arm on (and put your CDs in).  All in all, I think this car is fun to drive!  It goes fast and it has a sporty look but not a sporty price.

This is a wonderful first car for anyone.  In two years I have out 20,000 miles on it so I could see my family.  It's wonderful.  I don't think I would have it with a family, since I have a two door and they are by and large harder to put kids in!<br><br>
