              <b>O</b>nce only a hatchback 4 door, based on the Sephia sedan, the Kia Spectra for 2002 now shares the Sephia's sedan in its line-up. The infamous sedan that carried the name plate 'Sephia' is now history as a more youth oriented car, by the name of Spectra, has taken its place. 

   For 2002 the Kia Spectra is available in 4 trim lines, the base sedan, the Ls sedan, the GS hatchback, and the GSX hatchback. All trim lines carry the same powertrains which consist of a 1.8 liter DOHC unit producing 125 HP @ 6,000 RPM and 108 lb-ft of torque @ 4,500 RPM. Transmissions include either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic. My test Spectra was a LS Sedan coupled with a 4-speed automatic. 

<i>Driving Impressions:</i>


Off-the-line <b>acceleration</b> is slow at first, but once the revs get up the Spectra sedan moves without too much fuss, even despite the transmission shifting up too quickly, or even slipping at times (mostly under full throttle). The Spectra at <b>idle</b> was smooth most of the time, but I did notice some vibration in the steering wheel during long waits at stoplights (this could have been due the fan running), or due to the fact that this is a normal attribute of a car boasting a small engine such as the Spectra. The Spectra might not be on your shopping list if you live anywhere where driving up steep hills is an everyday event. While the Spectra does not keep you in the slow lane on steep inclines, you will notice the engine and transmission get quite fussy. Engine noise on hills can get annoyingly loud, and the 4-speed transmission seems to aggravate the situation further. 

<b>Handling</b> in the Spectra is good, while it doesn't really relish corners, it offers decent grip, and does a relatively good job keeping the driver confident while driving on the twistys. 

<b>Cruising</b> in the Spectra at freeway speeds of 65-70 MPH is a little noisy. The Spectra is affected by wind, engine, and road noise which is quite common for a car in this segment. The Spectra's ride quality is affected greatly on bumpy surfaces, the suspension is not as forgiving as other sedans in this class, such as the <b> <a href="/content_59101580932"> Honda Civic</a> </b>. 

<b>Braking</b> is adequate, even though my test car did not come equipped with ABS (which is an option) the front disc/ rear drum 'dinosaur' set-up seemed to work just fine for this car. 

<b>NOTE:</b> Even though some reports are much lower, according to EPA you should expect to get around 30-32 MPG while doing conservative freeway driving.

  The Kia Spectra Sedan sits on a 100.8" wheelbase and has an overall length of 177.6". The <b>suspension</b> consists of Macpherson struts all around with coil springs, and front and rear anti roll bars.

<i>Interior accommodation:</i>

  The <b>interior</b> of the Kia Spectra is not really what you would expect from a car that has a base MSRP of less than $13,000. The cabin is pleasant, and has a solid feel to it unlike early versions of the Sephia. The Spectra has a tasteful dash, with an easy to read instrument cluster, ergonomics are excellent, and so is the drivers position, rear vision is also good. A more civilized interior than the Rio (a lesser model made by Kia), the Spectra offers plenty of standard equipment. Some noteworthy standard and optional amenities on my LS tester included, a center console, 2 cup holders, adjustable (drivers side) cloth  front bucket seats, power windows and door locks, tachometer, AC, AM/FM CD player, cruise control, and much more. The front seats are a little hard, but they are comfortable and do offer good support. There is plenty  of front passenger room, the front passengers will not feel like they are sitting on top of each other as with some small sedans in this class, i.e the <a href="/content_56290872964">  Kia Rio</a>, the rear however is slightly cramped, and adults over 5'6" will probably be a little uncomfortable on long road trips.

<i>Exterior innovation:</i>

  The <b>exterior</b>, while not ugly by any means, is quite plain. The hatchback versions do offer some 'stand out in a crowd' appeal, but the sedans are somewhat blase and really have nothing to set them apart from the hundreds of small sedans on the market. The Front fascia of the Spectra is attractive, but again does not set this sedan apart from the masses. Flush mounted head lamps are fitted, the grille has a chromed finish, and fog lamps add a nice touch. From most any angle the Spectra sedan is very conservatively styled, no abrupt lines, or 'look at me' styling cues. 14" steel rims were fitted on my test car, but alloys are optional.

  <i>Price, Reliability, and Warranty:</i> 

The Spectra LS sedan starts at around $12,000, but with all options the price can rise to nearly $15,000. The sticker on my test car weighed in at $13,900. As for reliability, the Kia Spectra has had mixed reviews, most are favorable. I do have a friend with a 1999 Kia 'Sephia' with the same 1.8 engine and it has held up very well over 40,000 miles. If anything does go wrong with your 2002 Kia Spectra, you are given the luxury of a  5 year 60,000 mile bumper-bumper warranty, a 10 year 100,000 mile power train warranty, and  5 years of unlimited mileage roadside assistance.

<i>Conclusion:</i> 

The Spectra seems to be a good car, however I feel that saving your money for a new Civic or Neon might prove to be a wiser investment. I'm going to recommend the Spectra due to price and warranty. This is a car that seems to offer a good value, however not accommodating enough for most consumers including myself.


-Happy car shopping
