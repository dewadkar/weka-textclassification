            The Casio EX-Z3 is the first digital camera I have owned and significantly used.  I have much experience with a 35mm compact and SLR cameras.

The reason I bought this camera was because my friend works at Casio and he gave me a discount for it.

Cons:
For a camera this small it is capable of taking very good pictures.  However at night the picture quality degrades tremendously since the flash is weak.  In order to take good night shots the user must be really close to the object or a good source of lighting must be in effect.

The biggest problem I have with this camera though is the small buttons.  Heck I don't have large hands but this camera was designed for people who have toothpicks as fingers.  What Casio should have done enlarge the power button and separate the advance/rewind button.  When I am reviewing pictures on the LCD screen I sometimes hit the delete key since pushing down brings the "delete" function and this just frustrates me.  I told my friend this and he just laughed... that punk.

The other problem I had was that on some of my day pictures I observed a yellowish tint.  I am not sure why this occurs in some pictures and not in others.  I assume it's the lighting.

Pros:
This camera is really small.  In fact I can fit this into my pocket along with my wallet and cell phone and not feel like I have a car stuck in my pants.

The other thing that I liked was the large LCD screen which is bigger than many other digital cameras almost twice its size.  This is helpful since not many people use the viewfinder.  Casio should have just gotten rid of the viewfinder and let the people use the screen instead.

The other pro is that everyone who looked at this camera loved it. "It's soooo cute".... "Is that a camera?" .... "What the heck is that?" ... and so on.

If the right environment is available this camera is capable of taking good quality pictures but it is very sensitive to the environment so if you own one or plan on getting one then make sure the environment is optimal.
