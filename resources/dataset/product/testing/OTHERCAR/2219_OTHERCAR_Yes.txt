                 When we went car shopping I wanted a convertible and something that would be economical.  The first time I saw my &quot;Bluejay&quot;, I fell in love.  
We weren't looking for a brand new car but this was so economical, that I had to have it.  I got the 2 door, soft top and felt like a kid again.
This is the second convertible that I have owned and it is by far the best.  I just loved riding around with the top down in the summer.  My children all tell me I am in my second childhood, and I am now 60 years old.

     There is plenty of room in the cargo area, much more than I thought.  I bought an adult, 3 wheeled trike and it fit in the back with no problems.  I like how easy it is to put the rear seat down for more cargo room.

     Have just returned from a road trip of 1200 miles and the gas mileage, even with the higher prices, was better than I thought it would be.  This car is very comfortable, even on long trips, that I wouldn't hesitate to take it cross country.  I have a bad back but riding for hours in my Suzuki didn't bother me at all.

     I got my car in June so haven't had a chance to drive it in the snow yet, but I am sure it will handle just fine.  It handled beautifully on our trip, never hesitating at all even going 85 miles per hour.  My daughter and I shared the driving and she likes it as much as I do.  <br><br>
