            This is a great car!  I have had my Saturn since 96 and she has been great to me ever since.  

With no major problems other then needing to change the battery my car has run wonderfully.

I average about 30 miles to the gallon and I am not the most efficient driver on the road.

One down side to the Saturn is its radio.  Putting a CD adapter in the tape deck does not work.  I asked the Saturn tech about it and he said for some reason they just don't work.

I will buy a Saturn for my next car and recommend you get one too.
