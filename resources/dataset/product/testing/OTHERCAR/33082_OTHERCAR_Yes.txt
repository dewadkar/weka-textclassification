            I went from a 2k Celica GT to the Avalanche, and the transition took about a week. Overall I like everything about the truck, except it's heavy and could use more brakes although they are adequate. Tail gate and side compartments should unlock with the doors, or have a different key? Midgate should lock, bed panels are heavy in the provided bag, leave it in the truck. Give me more cigarette lighter outlets one in the bed would be helpful. Also give us the Escalade backup sensors. The bed panels are great for the drive-in movies just throw the kids on the top, and hose it off when you get home.

The driver side floor mat needs to anchor.

I love how quite the ride is although the windows could seal a little better. The non-bose stereo distorts horribly at anything above 1/2 volume. 

I have only had it for 3 weeks but so far it's great I get about 16MPG combined city and highway and I have a heavy foot, can't get enough of the V-8 sound.

The tailgate is very high and due to the rubber anti-slip bed liner it makes loading difficult.
