            This little car has been going strong for 6 years,
It is so dependable that it leaves me with no fears.
It's my mom's car
and it's come quite far.
It started out as belonging the my oldest
Sister when she got her license and she was definitely the boldest.
She drove it here and there,
It really wasn't fair
For the other three of us,
We had to take the bus.
The maintenance is really good,
Not too much broken under the hood.
It is really quite reliable,
The steering could be considered viable.
It seats four comfortably both in front and rear,
And so agile that you won't hit a deer.
Nowadays it has a Jack-In-The-Box head on the antenna,
So that I may listen to &quot;Smooth&quot; by Santana.
You will only take routine trips to the shop
For normal repairs that won't make your money drop.
Anyone who needs a reliable, comfy drive 
Will be able to thrive
In this excellent compact car
That may even take you to a grill and bar.
