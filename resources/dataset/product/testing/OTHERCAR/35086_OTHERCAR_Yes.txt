            I do not own a Subaru Outback, nor do I plan to, but the simple fact of the matter is I and four of my friends owe our lives to the safety features found in this vehicle.

It was a lazy summer afternoon in the middle of farm country. The sun was beginning to set, and my friend Mike asked the girl whose house we were at if he could take his parents' new Outback in the wide open field behind her house. After receiving consent, he and his bud hopped in and went off-roading for about twenty minutes. Eventually they came back up and enticed us to go along for the ride. I said sure, why not, should I buckle up, how fast are you gonna go, etc. My close friend Claudia sat on the lap of the boy in front, and another kid got in the back with me. The driver recommended seatbelts to the two in front. They thought about it, then said, sure, I guess. They buckled up, and we were off.

I was not in the car for more than 45 seconds. That was all the time needed for Mike to accelerate to 50 miles per hour and forget about the drainage ditch we had to cross to reach the open field. Before I knew it the Outback had soared off the edge of the ten foot high ditch and crashed head-on into the other side twenty feet away. 

The windshield was cracked, the car was beginning to sink in the murky swamp at the bottom of the ditch, smoke was everywhere. But both airbags had deployed, all seatbelts locked, and everyone walked away. I cannot ever own an Outback because I prefer not to be reminded of how close I came to dying. However, I will recommend this car to anyone worried about the safety and well-being of their children, their spouse, their parents, or anyone else important in their lives.<br><br>
