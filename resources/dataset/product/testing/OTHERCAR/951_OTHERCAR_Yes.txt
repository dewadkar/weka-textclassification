            The C5 Chevrolet Corvette...an American dream. Chevrolet has come a long way since 1953 to the new C5 Corvette. The body lines are perfect and aerodynamic. Although this vehicle is somewhat heavy, it lacks no power with the 345 HP power train. Driving is an absolute luxury. Previously I have owned a 1979 Corvette and I thought maybe I would need a kidney transplant after driving the rough riding albatross. The 1999 Corvette is a smooth riding machine with an optional suspension adjustment located on the center console. Chevrolet should rethink what kind of tires to put on this car and leave Goodyear out of the running. People seeing you drive down the road, gawk and stare at this marvelous machine. If you are stopped long enough they will let you know in no uncertain terms &quot;What a beautiful car!&quot; you have.
In the cockpit there are a wealth of features to &quot;play&quot; with, from the different buttons on the dash which will tell you everything from tire pressure and oil temperature to two (2) trip odometers and when it's time to change your oil. If that wasn't enough, an optional feature is the Heads Up Display (HUD). This will show you the tachometer and MPH (digital)to other readings which you can select. Remember to keep your eyes on the road. You won't have to make any performance changes in the sound system either. A Bose-Delco system that will let you rock with the best of them.
The Chevrolet Corvette is not just for anyone. Mainly for the person who likes to see the Ford Mustang GT eat dust. Guaranteed, you won't be reading &quot;Have you Chased a Ford Lately&quot; unless you want to.<br><br>
