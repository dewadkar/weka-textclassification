            We recently purchased our 2000 Pontiac Montana and have been thrilled with it.  Our previous vehicles have been the Yukon Denali and GMC Suburban.  With three small children we needed all the room we could get.  We were not even thinking of a minivan when we went to the showroom.  We were going to order a new Yukon XL.  We have a habit of changing cars every year to year and a half so instead of waiting three months for the Yukon, we decided to try a minivan.

So far this minivan has been a delight to drive.  The one extra option we did get was the MontanaVision, the VCR/screen combination.  The first weekend we had the van we took it for a little road trip.  The kids picked out their videos and we were off.  The VCR feature is really nice for long trips.  The sound can be adjusted and earphones can be added.  The only disappointment here was that the On-Star system was not yet available on our model, but would be standard by mid-year with the MontanaVision.

The ride of the Montana is so smooth and the captains chairs are extremely comfortable.  The dashboard has everything right at your fingertips.  The steering wheel allows you control the volume of the radio and select a station or track on your CD.  The rest of the controls are either off to the right or on the steering column.

Another plus for us was the gas mileage.  Having previously owned the Suburban, our gas bills decreased by about 50%.  I am the primary driver of this vehicle, mostly around town, so the decrease gas expense was a great plus.  Also, the automatic sliding doors have made it so much easier to get my children in and out.  They can open and close the door by themselves.  With the remote keyless entry this feature is even more appealing with an armload of packages.  Also, the ease of removing and installing the seats allows us to configure seating arrangements to meeting our passenger, as well as hauling needs.

Some of the other nice extras are an on-board air compressor to fix flats, dual (front and back) climate controls, all wheel traction, power windows and locks and 24-hour GMC/Pontiac Road Assistance.

The only draw back we have found on this vehicle is the lack of decent beverage holders.  They are located rather awkwardly from the side of the passengers seat at the floor level and there is only one for the third row passengers.  None for the middle row of passengers.  It would be nice to see the cup holders on the center console and at the side of each seat. Maybe next time.

Right now we plan to keep this minivan for a couple of years.  It will probably fly by since it is such a joy to drive.  The Montana is reasonably priced and a great value for the money.  I think it is the sportiest of the minivans.<br><br>
