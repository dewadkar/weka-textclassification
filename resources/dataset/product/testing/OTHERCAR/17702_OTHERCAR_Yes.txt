            After owning a Honda, I thought I'd try this SL. I'm not much of a car enthusiast, and I wanted to pay as little as possible for something that offered reliability and decent gas mileage. This looks like it will turn into a good choice, for me. However, the drawbacks are significant, and a prospective buyer should know them. 

The car is not comfortable. On any drive that goes past an hour or so, the seat causes sweating (even when the cab is cool), and general soreness. This is compounded by an inability for me to fully extend my legs (I'm about 5-foot, 11). A $13 lumbar supporting seat cover did wonders for that discomfort caused by the seat, which I think is due to cheap cloth and mushy padding. Also, the driver's seat doesn't exactly point toward the front of the car. Its weird, and it takes a while to notice, but the driver actually faces a little toward the driver's side of the car. This really bugged me at first, but I since have gotten used to it.

It is noisy. The engine makes more noise than one that size should. I knew this going in and learned from several sources that Saturns always have done this. So it doesn't bother me. I knew I wasn't getting a Lexus, and my only concern about noise was as an indication about mechanical problems. The wind noise is notable. At highway speeds, its pretty darn loud. Again, if comforts are important, consider this factor. If you are strictly focused on the financial aspect, the noise may be irrelevant.

Gas mileage isn't what I was hoping for. I'm getting the sticker mileage, but in the past with other cars I had always done better than sticker (I always drive sticks). I do remember that my Civic didn't start hitting really great mileage until after 40,000 miles or so... we'll see how this one does.

One other complaint. I broke a windshield when catching a rock from another vehicle. I heard the rock hit and was surprised when moments later I saw the crack. It wasn't that hard a hit. Maybe it was one of those fluke things, but it has me wondering whether the glass is as tough as on other vehicles.

Beyond that, its been a good experience. The frame is tight (tighter than any car I've had) and I like that feel. It shifts fairly nicely. I like the Saturn reputation for reliability, coupled with the relatively low maintenance costs.

One caution for inexperienced drivers. The frame gives an illusion of better handling than the car actually has. The suspension is pretty poor and causes the car to bounce a little when maneuvering sharply. Because the frame is so tight, sometimes the car hugs curves real well. But if you get any bounce going into the curve, watch out. I would guess that experienced drivers won't have any difficulty discerning the difference between this and a car that truly can handle. For others, the car's ability to retain its shape might make them think it can do more than it was designed for. If you buy one, remember why. Its an economy car.
