            This camera is in the wrong category.  Both my owner's manual and Kodak's web site state the resolution at 1.3 Megapixels.  With that out of the way, I think it is a very fine camera but could use a few improvements.

It's reasonably priced; it now sells for about $425-475 by mail and $480-550 in stores.  For that, you get a 3x optical zoom, which is one of the most important features.  You also get a 2x digital zoom but this is a relatively useless feature on any camera and is the only zoom on most entry level models.  The reason it's useless is because you are just taking the picture and digitally magnifying it, like zooming in on a picture in the computer.  You lose quality equal to the size gained.

The very well made camera also includes a tethered lens cap (much harder to lose than detachable caps but a little less convenient than some motorized ones).  It comes with 4 alkaline and 4 rechargeable batteries and a wall mount charger.  It also includes USB, serial and video transfer cables as well as software.  Finally, an 8 MB CompactFlash card is included.  All in all, you can easily get started the minute you open the box if you put in the alkaline batteries while the others charge.  It's also great because you can always get ahold of AA betteries if the ones in there die.

As far as other Kodak offerings, the similar DC280 has a 2 megapixel resolution and a slightly better lens, but I don't think it's worth the $150 price premium over the 240.

I compared it to other cameras in use.  For its very high construction quality and picture quality it is portable and compact.  This is a consideration because Sony cameras for instance, are much larger and this may discourage you from taking it along.  Editing and reviewing pictures on the camera is much faster and simpler than on many others (Olympus and HP models I tried) thanks to the fast access and sharp LCD display.  It also transfers to the PC at a reasonable speed through the USB interface, but the serial interface is slower than I would like.

The quips I have are that most cameras in this price range are at least 1.6 megapixels.  While I am very pleased with the picture quality, if I want to make my pictures or portions of them larger, they will not look as good.  Also, the memory card included should be at least 16 MB (I ended up getting a SanDisk card soon after I bought the camera because I always use the highest resolution and the 8 MB card doesn't store enough photos). The included Picture Easy software does not have that many features, but it is simple to use and adequate for most people.  Of course, the pictures can be saved in a variety of formats for editing with other programs.

Overall, this is a very good camera but should have a higher resolution at this price.<br><br>
