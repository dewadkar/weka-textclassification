                 On my never ending quest to find the &quot;perfect&quot; car, i have run into suv's, sport cars, you name it i had test driven it. But there was one car special enough to really catch my attention. The very first moment i set my eyes on it i felt as though i were looking at a vehicle of heaven! I knew i had to give it a test drive. 
As the salesman started ripping off impressive facts about the car's super powerful engine, its chassis and unique features, I indulged myself in the car's smooth and luxurious ride. Never before had i felt anything near to the Mercedes. My passenger stopped spewing information for just a moment and said, &quot;Wow, you really like this car, don't you?&quot; And boy was he right! That very day i purchased the vehicle and took it home to my wife and four kids. 
Everything, as most know, comes with a downfall or negative side. The car does guzzle gas. I must admit. But if you are considering purchasing this car, you probably should be able to handle the few extra bucks. This car is not cheap!
