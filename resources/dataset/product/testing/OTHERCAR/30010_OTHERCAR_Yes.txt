            The Kodak DC280 is my first digital camera and, as it would appear so far, the only one I�ll need for quite some time. With great resolution and a quick learning curve, the DC280 provides powerful picture-taking ability within a reasonable cost. In my week of intense usage (over 150 pictures�78.9 megabytes) I have discovered only one thing that I would change about the DC280.

Let�s talk affordability. My loyal (thank you!) readers know that I�m a college kid. My friends know that I�m a more resourceful college kid than most, consequently I was able to afford the DC280 while maintaining a reasonable level of subsistence. I was going to buy a one megapixel digital camera about five months ago, but at my parents� urging did a little research first. What I found was several nice cameras in the $600 range--$300 more than I had budgeted for a camera. I fell in love with the DC280�s ease of use and great resolution, so I resolved to buy it when the price neared $300. Finally, just last week, I ordered a refurbished (with a one-year warranty) Kodak DC280 from PCNation.com for the surprisingly low price of $345 (excluding shipping). The DC280 is supposed to come with only 8 MB of memory (CompactFlash card), so I bought a 64 MB card directly from Kodak�s website via $3 next day air. 

To my surprise, when I popped the included CompactFlash card out of the camera, I found that it was 32 MB�a $100 value. Consequently, my math shows that I got a $600 camera (though refurbished its in perfect shape and has a great warranty) for only $250! What a shocking value, even for a determined bargain shopper.

Having taken all of our Thanksgiving pictures with the DC280, I began the process of uploading all pictures from the camera and printing select ones. I was amazed at the speed of upload�just using the USB cable included and a direct connection to my computer from my camera (no CompactFlash card reader) I uploaded 64 MB of pictures in just over five minutes! But here�s the real question: how did they turn out?

Using my Lexmark Z42 1200 x 2400 dpi printer I printed one of the better pictures and�it looks exactly like a photograph! All I had to do was set the Lexmark to natural color, highest quality prints, and glossy/photographic paper and viola! five minutes later I was done printing. The quality amazed all my roommates.

Included are some of the features, direct from Kodak�s website (http://www.kodak.com -- who knows the camera better than the maker?):

As I mentioned, there is only one negative feature about the DC280--low optical zoom. It has only 2x optical zoom, and I really would rather 3x or 4x. But the good far outweighs the bad: great resolution, easy to use, aesthetics...you can't go wrong with the DC280.
