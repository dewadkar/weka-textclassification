            I purchased my Highlander in April and have enjoyed it a great deal.  It drives with the smoothness of a car, but transports like a sport ute and takes the beating of one too.  After looking at many sport utes, the Highlander seemed like the perfect size.  The back is big enough to transport oversized items, unlike the mini-utes, yet the car doesn't give that Sequoia-Expedition look either.  When carrying larger items, the back seat folds down flat and supports a lot of weight.  At the time that i purchased it, i was slightly annoyed at being, well, forced to purchase options that i didn't really want in order to get it in sooner.  Apparently since it was brand new at the time, they either came equipped with such features as a roof rack, trailer prep package, mud guards, etc. or you couldn't get any of them.  This is probably not an issue any longer though.  In addition, the 2001s (first year model) has been recalled twice so far -- once for a cylinder cap, once for a sensor.  Neither a problem, just annoying to bring brand new car in for service other than routine oil changes.  Overall, i would definitely recommend the Highlander -- it is a fabulous car and has served me well so far!
