            I recently went shopping for a new digital camera.  Living on a tight budget, I shopped around before I decided on a model to purchase that would be within my budget and yet would take good pictures.  A lot of the cameras I had heard about took grainy pictures which is something I was trying to avoid.

After looking at several models and seeing what they could do, I settled on a HP 315.  This neat little camera is a 2.11 megapixel camera, with a 1.8" LCD, has a USB port (to upload pictures faster), an auto-timer, an 8MB compact flash memory card, red-eye reduction flash, and 2.5X zoom capability . I think that's pretty good for a camera that costs about $300.

I have used mine a lot since I purchased it and am very pleased with it.  Even my hubby was impressed and was glad we picked it up.  

There may be better cameras out there, but for the price and for what I wanted to use it for, it's a marvelous product.
