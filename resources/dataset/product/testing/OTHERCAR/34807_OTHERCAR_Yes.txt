            Love it or loathe it, the Land Rover Discovery (or &quot;Disco&quot;) inspires more passion than any other SUV.  Here are five reasons why I'm still driving my 1999 Disco II, along with five reasons why I kinda hate myself for it.

1.  I CAN'T HELP IT... IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL:  If SUV's were movie stars, the Disco would be Sean Connery as James Bond.  No other SUV even comes close to offering the Disco's combination of rugged good looks and a reserved, slightly menacing and ever so British suavity.  Whether you're admiring it from the curb or taking in admiring glances from behind the wheel, the Disco is a class ride.  ON THE OTHER HAND:  Beauty is only body-panel deep.  Trust me, the infatuation evaporates the very first time you ride back to the dealership in the cab of a tow truck.

2.  OFF ROAD = OUT OF SIGHT:  When it comes to off-road performance, this truck kicks class and takes names.  Unlike most U.S. and Japanese SUV's, which are basically pickup trucks with larger cabs, the Disco was purpose-built as an off-road vehicle.  With its higher clearance, rugged frame and suspension and unique features like Hill Descent Control, it can take on and top anything but a Hummer.  ON THE OTHER HAND:  Aside from the test track at the dealership, I have yet to do any serious off-roading in my Disco.  What, take this thing into the woods?  And scratch the paint?  Are you kidding?

3.  NOW DAT'S CLASS:  Spring for all the options and you'll get a rolling showcase of state of the art luxury appointments.  I won't go into the details, but the high points include stlyin' leather and wood trim, a pretty nice sound system, dual sunroofs, a &quot;cold climate package&quot; with an instantaneous windshield defroster and (quite effective) seat warmers, and power everything.  For once, the TV ads don't lie: you won't feel the slightest bit self conscious stepping out of this truck in a tux and handing your keys to the valet as you and your date sweep up the stairs to the ball.  ON THE OTHER HAND:  What is it with the Brits?  Having bought Land Rover, BMW should ship the entire design team at Solihull to Japan for a crash course in ergonomics.  Few things in this vehicle are where you expect or want them to be.  Opening the right window from the driver's seat, for instance, is always a game of Russian roulette.  Good luck finding the CD changer without reading the manual.  (It's behind a panel under the front passenger seat.)  Most importantly, you need a postgraduate degree to shift this thing into four wheel drive.

4.  STIRRED, NOT SHAKEN:  The Disco drives like a tank -- a really well-suspended, well-insulated tank with plenty of horsepower.  Past critics have pooh-poohed its handling, but the 1999 version includes an option called Active Cornering Enhancement, which minimizes tilt on turns and radically improves performance at high speeds.  Under ordinary conditions, the Disco offers crisp steering, authoritative handling and all the oomph you could ask for, even in ugly weather.  ON THE OTHER HAND:  This is one thirsty SUV.  Even taking into account its massive weight, it just inhales fuel.

5.  ARE YOU BEING SERVED?  While visiting a car dealership or service bay isn't on anyone's top ten list of favorite experiences, Land Rover makes it as painless as possible.  The salesmen I dealt with were low-key professionals who knew their products, not the over-the-top hard sell artists I ran into at competitors' sites.  I've never had trouble booking a service appointment or getting a loaner during repairs.  ON THE OTHER HAND:  You know where I'm headed here, don't you?  Even with the &quot;all new&quot; 1999, the Disco is not going to win any reliability awards.  I've had problems with a number of the systems on the car, including the windshield, power door locks and towing array and, to top it off, unreliable brakes (including an ABS gremlin that just won't go away).  The guys in the service bay are wonderful human beings, but I wish we weren't on such familiar terms.

In sum, driving a Discovery is like dating a gorgeous but flighty movie star.  You're not 100% sure they're going to show up for your next engagement, and even when they're with you they're a bit flighty.  Sure, it's nice to get the window table at the restaurant and all your friends are jealous, but doggone it, looks aren't everything.  Still, you know you're falling hard and, despite yourself, you're going to beg them to see you again.  You're just not sure you'll respect yourself in the morning.<br><br>
