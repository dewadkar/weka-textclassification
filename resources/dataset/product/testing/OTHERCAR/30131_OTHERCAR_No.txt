            When I set out to purchase a convertible in 1994, I thought I was going to buy a Miata. However, after test-driving that diminutive car, and discovering that the windshield only came up to the middle of my face, I realized that other cars needed to be examined. The moment I drove the Saab, I knew I had to have it. Here was a vehicle that moved like a rocket, felt solid like a tank and was as quiet as one would expect for a luxury car.
Unfortunately, my pleasure rapidly faded. From the day I picked the car up at the lot, the motorized convertible top malfunctioned. On a regular basis, the motors would burn out, leaving me with a useless top and forcing an emergency trip to the dealer.
There were other, inexcusable mechanical failures as well. The bolts holding the power windows to their movement mechanisms fell out on both the front and rear windows. The side mirror popped out of its housing. The rear window defroster wire became un-soldered, the glove box latch broke, the screws holding the door on came loose, and the clutch gave out!
While under warranty, Saab fixed most of these problems gratis. However, my overall satisfaction with the vehicle was significantly reduced. When one pays $35,000 for a vehicle, one expects a solid, reliable vehicle, not one that requires a trip to the shop every few months.
I understand that Saab has totally redesigned the top mechanism for the 9-3, and that these changes should avoid the chronic failures that I experienced.  However, given the shoddy construction (screws coming loose etc.), I must imagine that their problems lie deeper than an underdesigned top mechanism.
On the other hand, if this car didn't have these problems, I would gladly recommend it. I love driving my Saab. The turbo kicks in and shows you what the passing lane on the highway is for. The motorized, leather seats were definitely built for cruising. And the stereo is good enough for blasting out your favorite tunes. This is truly a great cruisin' machine.
In light of my love-hate relationship with this vehicle, it is difficult to recommend it. I've heard many other stories of poor Saab reliability. I've also heard many stories of Saabs that last forever! However, given my personal experience with the vehicle, I'd suggest steering clear of this model year. <br><br>
