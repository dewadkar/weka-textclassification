            So on a dare I went to West Side VW here in MN to test drive a New Beetle.  Being 6'9" tall I have a very hard time squeezing into a vehicle let alone shutting the door and actually driving.  What I found with this vehicle was my dream car for fitting into.

Now I have heard all the Big Guy Little Car jokes for over a year now, but I tell you what I am more happy with my brand new car than my wife is with her Mazda Protege.

The seat actually moves DOWNward so I have a good 5 inches of head room, I move the seat all the way back, but I don't honestly think that this vehicle was designed to allow anyone but children in the back seat.  Even with the passenger seat all the way to the front there isn't much room back there... but I have sat back there just to see and it's tolerable for a short period of time.

Performance:
I've had this car for over a year now and it still feels as though it's on rails.  It's got alot of accelleration when needed, best for a car of it's class.

Some idiot cut in front of me one morning about 2AM (I work the service industry so I am lucky to avoid the drukns alot) and the anti-lock breaks are a total lifesaver.

I've brought it in for all scheduled maintenance and oil changes every 3-4k, even though "they" state you can go 5k... just doesn't sit well somehow.

It's great to be apart of the "slug-bug" phenomenon.
