            I bought a subaru outback after reading commands posted on epinions.com and test drove one, initially it ride fine on a level highway, but I was not able to take it to the hilly area of western Connecticut.
Here are my feelings after 4 weeks of ownership. 
1, It provides nice highway ride, but short on low end power/torque in hilly areas.
2, Both front brake rotors developed deep cuts after only 650 miles and needed to be resurfaced.
3, It feels like a small car, steering wheel position is too low even at the highest adjustable position, my knee always hitting it during entrance and exit.
4, Windshield angle is sloping too sharp to back making exit and entrance difficult.
5, poorer MPG than expected (about 18mpg in combined driving).
6, I would suggest you to look at the 2001 Nissan pathfinder if you are looking for a car like ride SUV with power and handling.
