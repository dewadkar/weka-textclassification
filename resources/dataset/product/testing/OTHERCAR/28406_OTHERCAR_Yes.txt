            The nissan maxima se is probably the best car on the market for the money. The car even stripped down, which as base the car pretty much comes with all power equipment, has the best engine and ride in the four door sedan for under thirty thousand dollars.  I have owned a maxima of every year starting from 1990, and have never been let down by the value and performance that you get for your money.  The 222 horsepower is plenty good enough to light the front tires up from a dead stop, and the smooth acceleration all the way up to redline is what keeps me coming back for more maxima.  I always get the se versions because of the sports suspension and the good looks you get with this package.  Finally they started putting a little sportier rims on the standard se's, even thought i used to opt and buy after market rims and tires.  All in all i recommend this care very much, and i just can't understand why someone would buy a different car in this class and price range--camery,626,etc.  The only car that comes close would be the pontiac grand prix gtp.  240 horsepower and what a kick in the ass...  <br><br>
