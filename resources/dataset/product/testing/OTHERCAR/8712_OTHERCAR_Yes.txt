I love the coupe.  I test drove the coupe a few weeks ago and I was very impressed with it.  Aside from its sporty and attractive look, it drove extremely smooth, potholes were no problem for the coupe.  The longer I drove it, the more I wanted it, and at the time I was leaning towards SUV's.

The V6 engine drove well and was very quiet.  I really feel its in a category by itself.  In short, quiet smooth drive, high quality high performance and it looks good on the inside and out.   

I ended up going with an SUV since it was much more practical for me.  But when I'm ready for a second car, the honda accord coupe may do it for me.

Cost in the low to mid 20's.<br><br>
