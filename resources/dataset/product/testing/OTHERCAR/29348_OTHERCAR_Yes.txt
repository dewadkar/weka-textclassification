            My husband and I purchased our black 1998 Honda CR-V primarily because we wanted comfort AND class.  Over a several month period, we tested many SUVs, including makes from Toyota, Kia, Jeep and Subaru.  It all came down to price vs. quality.

We already knew that Honda was known for making quality vehicles.  Research in magazines such as Consumer Reports have proven, year after year that Honda ranks high in resale value due to overall quality of vehicles.  Although Toyota seemed to rank just as high, it all came down to driving the vehicles.*  

The Honda CR-V has many qualities including: OUTSTANDING storage room.  (It even has a fold-away table in the back that you can pull out for cookouts and camping!)  We also love the fold-away tray table in front that allows an average-sized person to walk between the two front seats, the great amount of head-room space...even though my husband and I are both short we have a friend who is 6ft 2 and he still has plenty of room to spare, access to the &quot;trunk&quot; by the option of opening just the window or the whole door, the easy mobility of the back seats to expand the trunk space, the easy to reach hazard button for emergencies, the 2 outlets (one in front...one in the trunk - perhaps for that portable electric cooler!), and of course...the gentle ride.

The major con...not a lot of &quot;get up and go&quot;...but honestly, it's not bad... (Our other vehicle is a Ford Probe and that has a lot of pep!)  The only minor con was that the Honda CR-V has an unusual feeling steering wheel.  Get in one and try it out!  It originally felt as if we were driving a small bus!  But don't worry...within about a week, that strange feeling is gone!  In fact, over time, that slight tilt of the steering wheel seems to take the edge off of fatigue on long trips (We drove the vehicle from New Jersey to Florida in 2 days!)...so really the steering wheel is a benefit!

The ride on the CR-V is smooth...in fact, where we live the street is a brick road...we don't really notice the bricks though.  It's that smooth.  And of course, riding in a CR-V gives you the slight advantage of looking over and beyond traffic.  What a benefit for those of us who are short!  (I'm about 5-2&quot; and my husband is about 5-8&quot;.)

Who should buy this vehicle?  Well, honestly I think this vehicle is for everyone:  families with children (our friend set up her 3 year-old's car seat in the vehicle and he was thrilled by the view!), couples (great for long romantic trips), singles (how sporty!)...even older folks can benefit from this vehicle:  One of our friends is an older woman who has a limp leg.  Getting in and out of this vehicle is a snap for her!)  It also has a fantastic view space from the back...virtually no blind-spots!)

Who shouldn't buy this vehicle?  Even if you don't like SUV's you should try this one out. It really drives just like a car!  I guess the only person who shouldn't buy this vehicle is a person who just wants to buy an expensive car that is not concerned about quality and value.  Certainly you get both here...



*Note:  We found that the RAV-4 did not have the same amount of space that the CR-V had.  The RAV-4 felt &quot;triangle shaped&quot;...more room at elbow area than head&quot;.  Also, we felt the window space was not as open and viewable as from the CR-V.  In addition, the colors of fabric that the RAV-4 used for the interiors left a lot to be desired!
