                 I am currently in the market for an SUV.  Not being sure what I wanted, I spent my weekend wandering around the car dealerships trying to discern which prospective SUV will soon be parked in my driveway.  The Nissan Xterra had caught my attention in commercials and advertisements, and even at the dealership.  The price isn't too bad, it looks nice, plenty of room inside.   Then I took one for a test drive...
    I'll start out with the good features.  The car has lots of neat features: I like where they put the spare tire, underneath... it is well out of the way, yet easy to access, and it is a full spare.  There is a lot of storage room in the back, and lots of hooks to secure items.  The cargo area on the top of the vehicle is also convenient.  And this really caught my attention... the smoothness of the ride.  I have never ridden in a non-luxury SUV that rides as smooth as the Xterra.  It easily glides over bumps and potholes.
    The vehicle does unfortunately leave a lot to be desired.  There are several obvious ways Nissan cut costs on this car.  The most obvious being they did not have to re-engineer the frame.  They simply copied it from the Nissan Frontier.  Extremely cheap plastic is used on the bumper... the type that easily will fade in the sun or any bad weather. I test drove the 4WD V6 automatic Xterra.  It has decent acceleration, nothing to be overjoyed about.  I would not be concerned except for the squealing the automatic transmission makes on a normal takeoff.  It is very unsettling.  The car also feels very top-heavy on turns, even slight turns.  The interior of the car is very, very plain.  I was bored in the car... the monotony of the interior literally gave me a 'blah' feeling.  Controls are simplistic...maybe in this case TOO simplistic.  The rear seat that folds down to accomodate more room in the back is also very cheap.  Two plastic clips are what holds the seat down, and they bottoms of the seat actually have to be removed before the back can be folded down.  Also, the cargo bin on the top of the car only holds 30lbs., and it actually blocks the use of the sunroof, if the car is such equipped.  The worst feature of all is that leasing is not cost-effective.  Most leases are $250+ and that is the extremely underpowered, stripped, 2WD version.  The loaded 4WD usually runs in the mid to high $400's.
    The braking on the Xterra is normal, and most features are so-so.  I was not overly impressed, thinking that the car would have lots of neat gadgets and features, but it does not.  It is not a bad vehicle by any means, but might not be what some people expect.
    I think there are better options on the market.  The Chevrolet Blazer and the Jeep Cherokee Sport offer very similar features at approximately the same price, without the cheap cost-cuts.
