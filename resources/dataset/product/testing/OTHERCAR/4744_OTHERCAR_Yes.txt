                   I have read many reviews on automobiles from aesthetic, interior, power, warranty, options, etc. points of view.  I believe an important, but always neglected area, though is from a steering and suspension system point of view, and let me tell you, most people are missing a very important part of researching a prospective major purchase by not being well enough informed in this area. You can find some very well engineered and built suspensions these days, but all the same some very weak and suspect ones in my experience, and my purpose is to help you make a more informed decision. After reading my reviews, read some on other aspects of the car you're looking for, from the experts here at epinions, and make your choice.

    The Audi A4 is a very fine automobile underneath. The steering and suspension system is top notch. This car is designed as a sport/ touring vehicle, and the German engineers have really done themselves proud. When I work on these cars I say <b>&quot;groï¿½artig jobben Junge&quot;,</b> <i>&quot;good job boys&quot;.</i>

    On most cars whether domestic or foreign, you see almost exclusively steel in the construction of most every part that makes up these components (<i>steering and suspension</i>). In the Audi A4 much of the suspension parts are made of aircraft quality aluminum. This will give you a more accurate tracking vehicle, because the aluminum will not have the elasticity of steel and thus will not flex as much resulting in instantaneous  reaction to your steering input.

<b>UP FRONT:</b>

    The front suspension is somewhat of a modified double wishbone configuration, <i>(made famous by the Honda Accord, and you know of the reliability of these)</i>, and handles the road with aplomb. When things turn twisty on those canyon and mountain roads, an impressive anti-sway system will keep things on the level as the g-forces increase in the corners.

  The mounting cradle for the front suspension is a massive machined aluminum unit that looks more at home on some kind of truck or formula race car. This is not a bad thing, mind you. I like to see over engineering in certain instances, and this is one of those. It is actually a thing of beauty, a very well designed and executed product.

   The only thing I don't like about the front end is the fact that it is not completely adjustable. I would like to see every suspension angle adjustable for individual driving taste and in case of that unfortunate &quot;incident&quot;, but in following the crowd, this one fails like most of the rest in limiting this.

<b>BACK THERE:</b>

    The only things that are ever adjustable on the rear suspensions are camber, and toe in/ out. On the A4 both angles are very well represented with eccentric cams to adjust both from the factory. Too many cars only allow you toe adjustment, and then you'll have to shim, or modify the axle somehow for camber, something that I really don't like doing. This has the ability to perfectly dial in the alignment settings from the get-go, and save your skin if it gets bumped out, while also allowing you to keep your tires wearing straight across.

   Again, as with everything else on this car, the rear gives you a confidence inspiring feeling with an anti sway system to rival the front. One of the best features of this ride though, is the Quattro all wheel drive. It will give you the feeling of being on rails. Point it into the apex of your favorite corner and it is all grip and go from there.


<b>IN CONCLUSION:</b>

  If it is the performance driving characteristics of this car you are looking at, or the safety and traction of the all wheel drive to keep your family on the road and heading forward, you really can't go wrong if this is one of the choices you are narrowing your search for a car down to. Read some more reviews on this car for the other features you want in your next vehicle, but rest assured that from the underside, you can't get much better than this.
