            After our third child was born,we realized we had to go to something bigger than a car. We knew it had to be a mini-van. We looked at every mini-van made. But,when it came to our final choice it had to be the Chevy Venture.The remote control door and the four doors made life on the highway a lot more convenient.The van we chose is white and is extended. It looks sporty even though it's extended,and we needed the extra cargo space.Our venture is very light on gas compared to the new popular suv's of today.We are very happy with our venture and will consider another one when it's time for a new one. Thanks Chevy for the venture.<br><br>
