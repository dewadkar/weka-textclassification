            I took my family on vacation to the Canadian Rockies and rented a Lincoln Town Car Signature Premium from Vancouver, British Columbia. We had a choice between renting a full-sized Ford Crown Victoria or Mercury Grand Marquis but we opted for the Town Car. I logged about 1,100 miles under a wide range of driving conditions: urban, rural, highway, freeway, high-altitude, rain... The Town Car had about 4000 miles on its odometer when we picked it up.

Our Town Car, from a major rental company, was well equipped: 8-way power driver and front passenger seat, dual-zone A/C, keyless entry (with numberpad on the outside of the driver's door), a trunk-located CD changer (neither the keyless remote fob nor the CD-changer were available, perhaps because it was a rental), dual front and side airbags, leather seating surfaces, wood trim (including the steering wheel), glass moonroof and power everything. A few other amenities included adjustable foot pedal height (bring it closer for shorter drivers and sends it further back for taller ones),  a motorized trunk latch (no need to slam the trunk shut, a gentle push just to get it latched will engage the motor to shut it close), rain-sensing wipers (adjusts speed according to the splatter on the windshield), driver's seat position memory for 2, and a distance sensor that lets you know how close you are to any given obstacle behind you when you shift the car into reverse.

What I liked: 

1. <b>The ride was great.</b> I own a '97 Lincoln Mark VIII (you may also read my review for it) and while both Town Car and Mark VIII ride on "air ride" suspension, the Town Car felt a lot "cushier". It��s like riding on marshmallows, but not so much that it feels like the proverbial boat. Bumps and other road imperfections were very well muted (there��s a lot of road construction going on in Canada!). Road noise and wind noise were very well hushed too. The ride, in all aspects, was very well isolated, which was a great stress-reliever for long family hauls.
2. <b>Handling wasn't as difficult as I had expected for such a long car.</b> Undeniably one of the longer cars on the road (and certainly in the parking lot!) I had expected that making turns and parking would require extra attention. Much to my surprise, making turns was effortless. The steering was rather precise for slower movement (like urban driving) and it didn��t feel too ambiguous at highway speeds. In fact, it behaved very predictably on the highway. You could still toss the car around, but you should not expect stiffness like a BMW. In parking lots, it didn't feel like the huge car that it is either. The back-up sensors (beeps continually to let you know you've come too close) made backing up a piece of cake. (I have a '02 Celica GT also and backing up the Town Car is a lot easier than looking out rearward on my Celica. Gotta get me one of them sensor gadgets on my Celica.)
3. <b>Responsiveness was also a plus.</b> Acceleration was brisk, even for a car weighing close to 6,000 lbs with passengers and luggage. The transmission shifted smoothly, though you can still feel the shifts, especially in the lower gears. Merging onto traffic or passing on the highways were effortless. Tap hard on the accelerator pedal and the transmission downshifts, sending you on a mini power rush with the 4.6 V-8 engine growling like a NASCAR stock car�K well, almost. It��s hard to tell it��s only rated at about 250 horsepower.
4. <b>Overall comfort</b> did not disappoint, save for the omission of lumbar support, which I missed. The seats were wide and well upholstered/cushioned. The armrest provided good support for cruising.
5. <b>Looks are subjective, but this car looks good.</b> The rear end doesn't look too different (there are changes, but they are subtle to my eye) from the last generation of Town Cars but the front end is markedly different, with the addition of the Lincoln star to the hood, which is a nice classy touch. It's particularly nice seen from the driver's seat. From that perspective, the hood is also nicely sculpted. 17-inch multi-spoke wheels give the car a modern yet still classy look. Outside door handles are chromed and easy to operate.

What I wish Lincoln would improve on future Town Cars:

1. <b>The level of luxury is adequate but no more.</b> The steering wheel adjusts only for height at set intervals, but does not telescope. Fit and finish were good overall, but there were some plastics that felt cheap. The doors closing sound more like a Crown Victoria taxicab than a tight luxury flagship's. There is no dead pedal/left footrest, which almost seems illogical for such a comfy cruiser. The trunk hinges were an intrusion to the trunk space. Lincoln ought to replace the hinges with struts that don't crush stored items. In the rain, water drips into the trunk area from the open trunk lid. Not exactly up to luxury standards either.
2. <b>Low tech�K</b> I��m not expecting the starship Enterprise, but then again it��s 2003 and everyone else (Audi, BMW, Lexus, Mercedes�K) in the big leagues has introduced some sort of technology into the cabin to make the driving/riding experience more pleasurable and amenable. The auto-dimming rearview mirror is a nice touch, but it wasn't as effective as the one on my Mark VIII. The radio/CD controls were too confusing (too many buttons on the panel) to operate safely and confidently while driving and the display only showed the basic stuff: AM/FM/CD mode, radio station or CD track number and time, volume and other audio levels, but it was one thing at the time on the one line display. Audio and temperature controls were also redundant on the steering wheel (a good thing), but I wish there had been a mute button on the steering wheel as well. Overhead with the map lights and switch for the moonroof, there was a 8-point compass, a display with the remaining percentage of oil life, and buttons for the garage opener (I suppose) as well as a trip computer that had to be toggled through it��s various functions (speed, fuel economy, distance to empty, average speed, trip odometers (A & B), and a selector for English or Metric readings.) A heads-up display unit would be great and would update the car��s interface with the driver. The dash has a digital readout of speed and car odometer, analog speedometer, temperature and fuel gauge, and PRN[OD]21 shift position indicator. My Mark VIII��s  on board computer can display instant fuel economy, and I was looking for that on the Town Car. HID headlamps should be standard on all trim levels. The Signature Premium came equipped with halogens that weren't even projection style. No fog/driving lamps either. Outside rearview mirrors should have turn signal blinkers incorporated somehow as a safety feature.
3. <b>Lumbar support was left out. </b> That's a taboo in this class. The rear passengers had two rear A/C/ vents but no cupholders when three passengers occupy the rear bench. The front arm rest opens up to reveal two decent size cupholders as well as some extra room for a cube of facial tissue or an extra bottle of water. The storage space within the armrest was also decent. A nice touch is that the armrest can open up from either the passenger or driver's side (they are hinged on both sides). There are also generous door panel storage spaces on the driver and passenger doors.\
4. The <b>automatic parking brake release</b> should release as soon as the shifter is moved out of the PARK position. This Town Car did not release the brake until the shifter was moved out to DRIVE. You have to release it manually if your first move was to back up. It's not a big deal at all, but makes you wonder what the engineers and designers were thinking. You still need the parking brake released to back up, don't you?
5. <b>Improve on quality.</b> The rear passenger window decided to quit one sunny day. Quality control could be better used to take care of such issues. It's only a car, but when you're dealing with a luxury nameplate's flagship, the bar is raised.
6. This isn't directly related to this Town Car experience, but having visited Lincoln dealers for service on my Mark VIII, I know that Lincoln is still a world away from providing its customers with <b>post-sales service</b> worthy of a luxury brand. Visiting a Lincoln dealer for service (at least here in Southern California) is virtually no different from going to get a '88 Ford Escort serviced. Lincoln has much to learn from Lexus, Infinity, BMW and the rest of the premium luxury brands in this regard. After-sale customer satisfaction and product support/service/maintenance is one area I consider very important now when I purchase a car. My Toyota dealer offers free roundtrip shuttle rides for service as well as other in-store amenities for those who prefer to wait. 

Overall, we were impressed with the Lincoln��s motoring abilities. The ride was extremely comfortable, the space was great (fits three car seats on the rear) and the performance (acceleration, handling and braking) inspired much confidence on the road. The trip computer displayed 23.0 miles/gallon for fuel economy at the end of our trip. Can��t tell if that��s the average or the highest fuel econ figures displayed, but the car just feels good. Do I think the car is worth its retail price? Perhaps not, given that the competition at this class has so much to offer as well in terms of technology, reliability and luxury details inside and out. Is this a car I would like to own? Sure, if price were no object. I look at it as a loaded upscale car. Do I recommend this car as a rental or for consideration to purchase? You bet I do. If you are shopping for a car of this size, give it a try. You might just be pleasantly surprised.
