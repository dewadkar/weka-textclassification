            When I test drove the Xterra, the salesman told me that this car was made for the crowd that actually wants to get their SUV dirty.  This vehicle just begs to be taken out to play in the mud.  It has rugged good looks, big all season tires, tubular roof rack, and plenty of space for adventure toys.  Quirky little extras include a first aid kit and built in bike rack.  

I almost had myself convinced that if I bought this vehicle, I would be traveling to great rough and wild peeks with my mountain bike.  I then had to force myself to wake up and admit that I don't have a mountain bike and most of my driving is on 8 lane freeways. None the less, the Xterra handles great on those freeways.  It has good power once up to speed but seems a bit sluggish getting there.  Steering is responsive and the interior is roomy.  

If my husband had been the primary driver of our next new car, we would undoubtedly have an Xterra sitting in our garage instead of the mini SUV (Subaru Forester) that we ultimately selected.  I do love Nissans.  My last car was a Nissan Sentra which I drove for 10 years without any major problems.  Yet in the end, I just couldn't justify buying a big gas-guzzling vehicle.  My husband will just have to look at it longingly when it passes us on the highway in route to those muddy adventure.<br><br>
