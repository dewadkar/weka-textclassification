            Okay, so it's an econo box, but whoever said that's a bad thing? I originally bought my Tercel because it was rated highly by Consumer Reports, inexpensive and made by Toyota.  The Tercels are basic, not many frills in them, but that's also what makes them great. My '91 Blue Tercel is a two door, standard with front and rear defrost, doughnut size spare, front wheel drive. (no A/C, no radio, vinyl seats) The trunk size is not bad. I've been known to fit in at least nine full bags of groceries 
with no problem. 

The best thing about this car is it's incredible reliability. I have NEVER had my tercel in the shop for anything other than standard maintenance: oil changes, rotating tires, replaced the water pump at over 100,000 miles and that's all she wrote!  At slightly over 107,000 miles, my Tercel shows no signs of stopping.  I've driven this car from the east coast to North Dakota with no problems.

As far as handling, it does a good job. The steering is tight and it has fairly good pick-up considering it's a four cylinder. The seats in back are a little small, but we could fit two adults in front and two adults in back. Those adults sitting in the back had a heck of a time getting out though! Out of curiosity, I recently test drove a '99 Corolla and the Tercel handled just as good, but cost a whole lot less than it's slightly bigger cousin the Corolla.  My little blue machine has front wheel drive which handles beautifully in the snow. I should know, I've driven in snow storms in the mountains of West Virginia and driven in a North 
Dakotan winter with it. Not to say that the Tercel is an off road vehicle, but it does the job! 

As far as for things I don't like about it, these negatives aren't because of the car itself.  It's simply luxury items that if I'd had more money at the time, I'd liked to have had.  For instance, mine doesn't have A/C, cloth seats or a radio.  Riding around in summer, no A/C with dark interior and vinyl seats - Yikes that hurts! But I love my Tercel! Now, if I can like this car as stripped as it is, you'd better believe it's been good to me!

This car is not for someone looking for a luxury ride with lots of bells and whistles (although many are available, you just have to pay for it). Nor is it optimum for parents having to lug an infant/toddler in and out of the back seat. It's perfect for students, as a commuter car, a second family car or a mature couple who have little money and don't want to worry about repair costs. It's a winner of a little car!
