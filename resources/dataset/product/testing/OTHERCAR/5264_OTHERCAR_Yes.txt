            I went to many dealerships checking out a variety of cars!  I was at a local Chrysler/Plymouth dealership when I spotted a semi sporty car with a unique color that  attracted me.  Everyone says that my car is purple but it is cranberry! I took it for a test drive.  It drove really smooth, I couldn't even tell the engine was on it was so quiet.  The interior had very soft material and everything is electronic:  The windows, the locks, the seats.  My car also has special features such as a sunroof, 5 disc CD changer, cruise control, etc.   I bought it for a mere $15,000 with an interest rate of .09%.  The only thing that disappointed me was that the afternoon I brought this car home, a major hail storm hit.  Hail the size of gulf balls pummeled my car.  It had dimples all the way around and broke my side passenger mirrors.  Luckily my insurance paid for all the repairs.  It cost $6,000 to replace the whole body and repaint it.  My car is almost back to new.  I guess cars really do depreciate after you drive them off the lot.
