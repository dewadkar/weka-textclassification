            This vehicle was purchased to hold my family, as we had outgrown our little Toyota.  It is roomy enough for the five of us to ride in comfort, yet versatile enough to remove both benches for hauling and even has a luggage rack on top for even more options!  This van is set on a truck frame, making it more durable, but harder on the tires and alignment.  Driving along in this, there's times when I feel beaten up by the sheer size of this vehicle in motion.  If you need the room, I'd say go for this vehicle.  If you really don't need this kind of room, I'd say to go for something smaller.  However, if you have several children, or your life frequently has you hauling several people...this is your vehicle!<br><br>
