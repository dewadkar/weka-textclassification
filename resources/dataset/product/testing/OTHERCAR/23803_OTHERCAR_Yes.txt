            I am a 6'3&quot; 320# guy and I own a Lincoln and a 1998 Taurus  because they are big and I can &quot;fit&quot; in them.  As with all cars that I have ever  considered, I have had to choose a car much like the clothes I buy.  If it &quot;fit&quot; me, then I could go from there and decide what color I wanted and what features I could add to it, often compromising what I really wanted in a car.  

I have never been able to even look at a compact car because they simply didn't &quot;fit&quot;.  Then along comes the Toyota ECHO!  I was surprised that not only did I &quot;fit&quot;, but this car was fun.  For example, the control panel in the middle of the dash board, is a fun novelty that works. It is innovative and smart. 

 Some of the many features you are instantly drawn to are the shape of the car, the roomy (and comfortable) eats, elbow room, easy to reach controls, and of course the reason we all want an economy car: the gas mileage.

 The biggest selling point for me was the shifting.  I have the manual transmission and honestly I have never had a car that shifted more smoothly than my echo. In many ways I feel like this car was built for me. 
Toyota was smart when they built the ECHO and kept costs down by not adding all the &quot;toys&quot;, while not compromising with the quality that Toyota is known for.  With oil changes and the regular maintenance, this car will offer good gas mileage, power, and 250,000 miles with out too much effort; and that is what most people  look for when buying an economy car . 

 I wanted an inexpensive car that will have power, get me from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot; in comfort and style with out killing me at the gas pump and at the dealer.  For some one who has always had a big car, I was happy to sign on the dotted line for a small car that fit me.   <br><br>
