            I have been driving my &#147sand drift&#148 colour Malibu LS since 1998 and just making sure I have made a right choice. It is very convenient for an everyday family usage: trips to work, shopping, and even comfortable enough for long vacation travels. I will describe my experience with Malibu by topics to make easier to read.

Reliability.
Excellent is the only word I can say. Not a single problem with the car for over 5 years and about 90,000 km. The only time I had to come to the dealer was at the very beginning, to replace the alternator because of the faulty rear bearing. Until now I hear do not hear a single squeak or thump or other noise from the suspensions (many Europeans or native cars would have had one by now, and probably would even require replacement of bushings or shock absorbers). Due to the perfect car reliability it is very inexpensive in its maintenance. By the way, Chevy Malibu has won two rewards from J.D.Power, both for the new vehicles, under 90 days, and for the 3-year olds. In both nominations it appeared to be the best in class for its dependability.

Performance and Handling.
These are really the cons of Malibu. The 3135 cc V6 is quite peppy and responsive: 8.8 sec 0-100 km/hr is very healthy for a family car. And the transmission is one of the best in the industry. I drove many other cars, SUVs, minivans, and none of them had as smooth gear shifting as my Malibu. Maybe, the only make that is not worse than GM with its transmission performance is Toyota. The car steering is also quite responsive, with a good reaction on the steering wheel. Certainly, it is not a sports car, but it can easily beat many competitors in its class with its sure handling feeling. I remember, one professional tester even compared the Malibu&#146s handling with that of BMW. And I will probably agree. At least getting into my Malibu after driving something else always gives me the feeling of very well controlled vehicle, obeying all my commands with ease. 
The LG8 engine design may be a bit conservative with its pushrods, but it is really smooth, with a good torque at low rpms. And it is very reliable too. Heard of those sludge problems in Toyotas, oil gaskets leaking in Toyotas, Fords and Hondas? None of that happens to this time-proven engine. It does not require premium gas, nor synthetic oil.

Fuel economy.
I think it&#146s one of the best in the class. I keep all my fuel-ups in the log. The average in all these 5+ years is about 9 l/100 km. And during our family vacation trips around Canada and USA I had about 7.5 l/100 km for the average highway consumption. In one my trip from Boston to Toronto (just myself in the car) I averages at 6.9 l/100 km. In the city driving I make about 9 litres in summer and a bit over 10 litres per a hundred in winter. I think, this is perfect for a ton-and-a-half car.

Ease of use.
Malibu requires only minor attention. The transmission fluid is good for life, the plugs work for 160,000 km, the coolant &#150 for 5 years or 240,000 km, the fuel filter is never replaced. And like I mentioned above, it needs almost no repairs or adjustments.

Comfort.
Malibu has enough space inside for four, and even for five. At the rear seat it is more spacious than Camry, Accord, or Taurus. The driver&#146s seat is comfortable for both short and long trips, with handy power adjustments. It is firm enough, and still not as woody as some German seats, for example. The climate control is effective. The audio system is also good enough for listening in the car. The automatic headlights are very convenient. The cruise control is easy to operate and holds the speed very accurately.

Body.
The body is very tough, nothing creaks, or squeaks inside. Though it lacks some noise isolation. The rust protection of Malibu is perfect. I haven&#146t seen a single Malibu yet with rusty spots. The doors are closed with a thump sound worth of even more expensive cars.

Some drawbacks.
I would mention here the brakes. They feel a little cushy, at least on my car. I tried other Malibus, their breaks were firmer.

Final words.
I recommended Malibu to several people already. And all of them remained happy with their cars. I am sure, Malibu is a great success of GM, and looking forward to seeing the new 2004 Malibu and Maxx.
