            As a former Olympus Digital Camera owner, I wanted to 'buck up' and get a newer model with all the new features available today. I was prepared to pay about $500 for a good, quality camera.  Unfortunately, that kept me out of the Sony Mavica market, as well as the other high-end digital camera 
models.

But being impressed with my prior Olympus model, I checked out the D-490 Zoom at CompUSA. The camera is LOADED with features. And folks, I am not sure of every camera on the market, but this camera has settings and features for every environment imaginable.  Sun, no sun, dusk, dawn, red-eye reduction, night shots, backlit, no backlit, the list goes on and on. You really have to experiment in all the environments to see what this camera can really do  With its 3-X zoom built into the camera already, you 
can get pretty close to your intended medium - even from a hundred feet away.  The camera can shoot in a variety or resolutions and quality (SHQ-TIFF, SHQ, HQ, etc.)  Saving the images right to JPEG or 
TIFF files on the card. Your images are stored out at 1600 x 1200 resolution and with the amazing auto-focus and hold-focus functions, your bound to get amazing photos. 

The interchangeable SmartMedia cards (the camera only comes with an 8MB card which can only store  about 16 high-res images, unfortunately) make it easy to bring along a few on your vacation, and swap them out until you can download the pictures to your computer.  A 32MB card (capable of storing about 64 good photos) is sold on the web for $38-60.  These cards make it easy to store and hold on to your pictures. 

The camera package comes with a Serial adapter and software to simply 'plug the camera in and download' in seconds.  Only downfall is an out-of-the-box USB adapter.  BUT, when I bought my camera in March 2001, you can send away for a free ZiO! USB reader.  So, it still is free.  The pictures are stored organized on the card by date and time; an added convenience.

All in all, with its 2.3 megapixels, 3X zoom, one hundred plus different settings per environment, flash, and SmartMedia capability...this camera is the best bang for your buck. For under $450 at some retailers, the Olympus D-490 Zoom is a great camera. Unless you are a master photographer, this camera is the perfect match of a vacationing family, busy business person taking pictures of workplaces/co-workers, or single people with a knack for good quality photos.
