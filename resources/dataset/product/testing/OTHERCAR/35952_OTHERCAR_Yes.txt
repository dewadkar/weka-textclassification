            I bought my '99 Civic because of its reputation as trouble-free, economical transportation.  The dealer gave me a very good price and finance package.  The quality seems to be quite a bit higher than that of its competition.

Driving the Civic is comparable to driving many other cars its size except that it is quieter than most others.  I am 6'2&quot; and 200+ lbs. and it has been reasonably comfortable for me even though I haven't taken any long trips in it.

The remote keyless entry is a feature I didn't even realize I wanted but I wouldn't buy another car without it.  My car has a CD player but all my music is on cassettes so I use just the radio.  I figure the CD player may help the resale value someday.

The major disappointment with my Civic has been the fuel mileage.  My car was rated 28 city/35 highway.  You couldn't drop it out of an airplane and get 35 mpg with it.  My (one-time) best highway mileage has been 32 mpg.  Typical mileage has been about 27 mpg with automatic transmission, but it has gone as low as 25 on more than one occasion.  It is satisfied with 87 octane fuel, though, just any brand.  My previous Toyota Tercel 5-speed never got less than 31 mpg (and that only once) and got 41 mpg on a couple of trips.

My Civic has never used the first drop of oil, period.  Honda insists you wait until 3,750 miles to change oil the first time.  Not even with &quot;break-in&quot; oil in the crankcase did it use any oil.

The (factory) air conditioning is weak when it comes to cooling off a hot car.  If the ambient temp is over about 92 degrees, it can take up to an hour to cool the car enough so that it is comfortable to leave the &quot;recirculating&quot; mode or reduce the fan speed.  The selling dealer said Honda warranty will not pay for air conditioner repair if the air conditioning is working.  A second Honda dealer checked the car and found nothing to repair.  My experience is that the outside temperature has to be below about 86 degrees before the air conditioner in &quot;fresh air&quot; mode produces comfort inside the car.  I expected better.
