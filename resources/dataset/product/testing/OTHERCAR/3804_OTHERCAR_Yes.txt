            I did a great deal of research before choosing the 2002 Honda CR-V.  After 8 month of driving this vehicle, I wanted to summarize some items I've not seen in other reviews.  We chose the 2002 CR-V EX and added a plastic hood deflector, and roof racks.  Colour is the Mojave metallic beige.

Overall, I am very impressed with the CR-V.  We purchased it in early spring 2002, and traded in our 1994 GMC Jimmy.  So far, other than the standard maintenance, no major troubles to report -- vehicle is very reliable.  Have taken it on several long trips -- one 9hr trip too!!!

Not so mini - mini SUV.

  While the CR-V is officially categorized as a mini-SUV, the new sizing of this vehicle does put it into a category with the Jimmy/Blazer in overall size.  While the numbers may not add up, I do get the feeling that the interior cargo space is larger --it's certainly higher than the Jimmy, and the interior design is just plain smart.  Seats either fold down, or fold down and unlatch forward so items such as bikes can be rolled right inside the vehicle.  The center console tray can be folded away with a small lever so items such as lumber or skis can be slid in the back all the way up between the two front seats -- very smart.

We do notice the vehicle is slightly narrower than the Jimmy.  We have a 4 month old girl, and this vehicle is her chariot. Vehicle comes stock with roof mounted tether brackets for a child seat.  Our infant seat is the type that locks into a mount that you fasten with the center seat belt and leave in the car.  With the child seat in the center back position, two adults can sit on either side -- but they have to have narrow bums -- and finding the female seat belt clip can be tricky as the car seat typically hides it.  Results in lots of fussing.

Lots of little storage compartments inside the vehicle for gas receipts, change for your Tim Hortons coffee or parking meter, CDs and so on.  Gets the clutter away from the drivers area.

We live in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains.  The 160Hp 2L engine has more than enough power to pull us up the biggest hills.  Loads of torque for passing at highway speeds, and we find the engine much quieter than our previous V6 Jimmy.  We compared this vehicle to the VUE, Escape, Blazer and RAV4 and were impressed that the Honda's 4 cylinder engine put out similar power numbers to the larger V6's -- and uses less fuel on top of that.

On the downside....

I do have a few complaints.  We are skiers and so had the Honda roof racks installed by the dealer.  Within the first week one of the side covers that hide the mounting bolts disappeared -- I suspect in the wind.  The racks are a fixed mount system and very difficult to reposition.  I was forced to drill new holes in my ski box to accomodate the mounting brackets.

At highway speeds, the vehicle whistles -- very annoying.  As yet, I am unable to determine what is whistling (and which tune :-0 ).  I suspect it is either the side mirrors or the roof racks.  In addition, I'm not overly impressed with the construction of the engine hood.  When driving the vehicle from the dealer home the first day, I noticed the hood shaking and moving while I was driving.  I actually stopped, got out and made sure it was properly latched -- which it was.  Honda has used such a light metal in the hood, that it actually ripples and vibrates from the wind.  I'd recommend taking care when opening and closing the hood as I suspect that one could actually bend it by hand.  This vehicle is certainly not an indestructable 1974 Ford LTD.

The combination of the AWD system and the Bridgestone Dueler HT All-Seasons does leave much to be desired.  This is my first AWD vehicle, and so far, I just don't think it provides the traction of a 4WD.  I've found the vehicle handles more like a Front Wheel drive in the snow -- which it is 99% of the time.  The front wheels will push through a snowy turn (understeer), and I've not felt the rear wheels engage yet.  My wife has had a few experiences of slipping on the icy roadways this season which suggests to me that the All-Seasons that come stock on the CR-V, are not really meant for winter weather and that I might have to swap these tires out for a more aggressive tread.  I've owned two previous 4WD vehicles -- the Jimmy and a Toyota 4x4 pickup.  With both, you knew that the 4WD system was engaged, and felt a noticable grip in snowy conditions.  The CR-V AWD system simply does not offer this same comfort IMHO.  Recommend either a more aggressive all-season (you will sacrifice some road noise), or a winter tread if you live in a snowy climate.

I mentioned the interior is large enough to fit two mountain bikes.  Remove the front wheel and lower the seat, and the bikes can slide directly in the back with the rear seats folded back.  I've had to do this because I found that there is slight right offset of the spare tire on the back door.  This offset means that when using a bike rack that mounts on the spare tire, your bikes extend out beyond the passenger side into traffic -- dangerous for your bikes, pedestrians and other vehicles.  Because the vehicle is so high, a roof mounted bike rack will be difficult to use on this vehicle -- not impossible, just a pain.  A trailer hitch bike rack is also not practicle on this vehicle given that you will not be able to swing the door open with the rack installed.

Finally, beware of the electrical system.  This vehicle does not come equipped with a battery saving interior light shut off, and on two occassions I have left an interior light on by accident and run the battery flat.  The switch by the back door can be bumped to the "on" positon when loading/unloading and will drain the battery flat in several hours.  Similarly, if the rear door or window are not latched properly -- lights stay on.  You'd think Honda with all their nifty toys would have equipped the vehicle with an interior light cut-off after 10 minutes.

Downsides aside, I did find this vehicle to be a better value than the VUE, Forrester, Escape and Blazer, and to date, we are very pleased with the overall performance.
