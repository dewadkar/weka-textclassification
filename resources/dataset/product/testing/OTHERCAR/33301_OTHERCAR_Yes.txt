            The 98 Subaru Forester L model is easily the finest automobile I've ever driven.  I bought this vehicle because I had read several good reviews for the Forester in consumer magazines.  Needless to say, I am extremely impressed with nearly all the features of this model.  It handles better than every CAR I have ever driven.  That's right!  A SUV handling better than a car.  I wouldn't have believed it myself before driving this automobile.

  Driving in New England winters is extremely hazardous to say the least.  That is another reason I decided to buy the Forester.  All models have a top notch anti-lock brake system and an all wheel drive, all the time system.  I have had to drive back to school during snow storms and in icy conditions many times already this winter.  While driving on winding back rounds, I have never once fish-tailed or lost control while taking a turn despite these poor road conditions.  I can not say enough about how great this suv handles.

  With the Forester's ABS system, stopping on a dime is not a problem.  It has already saved me from hitting a deer and slamming into the rear end of a car who slammed on their brakes unexpectedly.  This is also an extremely safe car, with steel beam siding and driver and passenger airbags.  The ride is also extremely quiet and smooth, with barely any outside noise coming inside.

  While the Forester is clearly a great car, it does have some downsides to it.  The back seat is not nearly as roomy as other suv's I've been in.  While it is not uncomfortable, it is far from roomy.  That is, unless the person sitting in the front seat has rather short legs.  Also, a pretty annoying feature is how quickly both rear side windows fog up when there is any sort of precipitation or moisture in the air outside.  What is even more annoying is there is no way to prevent this.  The one feature I've had to have repaired was the carpet lining of the back seat floor.  Out of wear and tear, it came undone.  This should not happen no matter how much wear and tear is put on the floor.  I expressed my disapproval to Subaru about that happening.

  Despite these flaws, the Subaru Forester should be purchased without a doubt if you're looking for a great handling, extremely safe, and cheap suv.  I cannot say how much I love this car.<br><br>
