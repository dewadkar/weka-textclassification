            My fiancï¿½e and I purchased a 2000 Elantra Wagon VE (value edition) this past March when my '93 Saturn SL1 rolled past 200,000 kilometers and would have been in need of some major repairs in the near future.  We bought the Elantra for 4 major reasons:  It was available as a wagon and thus gave us some extra room.  It still looked sporty in the wagon model.  It was supposedly very economical where gas was concerned.  And the price was reasonable with a very low financing rate over 5 years.  We were told by quite a few people, sales staff, friends, co-workers, etc..., that the Hyundai models were all-round capable cars and that they would recommend one to anyone who asked.

We have now had the Elantra wagon for nearly 2 months and I now feel compelled to write about our driving experiences with this specific Hyundai model.  (I will stay very car-specific with my Epinion as the dealership is a whole different Epinion for a later date in the future...)

Now, as you may be able to tell from the first paragraph, out of the 4 reasons we chose this car we feel the gas mileage we get out of our Elantra is quite lacking.  The 55 liter tank takes us as far as a 45 liter tank used to take us in my Saturn.  Now the reason this could be may come from the Elantra's 140hp engine.  My Saturn SL1 only had 85 horses under her hood and while confessing to be no expert on car mechanics this would seem like logical reasoning.  However, this brings up my next point.

We strongly feel this car has very little 'pep'.  By 'pep' I mean the ease of which to accelerate, merge with highway traffic, pass traffic, etc...  'Pep'.  My Saturn SL1 with only 85 horses had some 'pep'.   On the rare occasion I have floored it to pass or merge, the Elantra had very little 'pep' and is very noisy (without the corresponding action to go with the noise).  

The Elantra also has a very sluggish automatic transmission, which may explain some of the lack of 'pep' and power.  It takes many seconds for the transmission to switch gears and at highway speeds (greater than 100km/hr) the Elantra seems to work awfully hard to keep the status quo.  Pair this transmission with the lack of 'pep' and this car quickly becomes un-enjoyable to drive, especially on the highways.

On top of all this, a rather bleak development has just recently occurred.  Our Elantra has stalled 5 times over the last 24 hours while driving in the city.  It's going to the shop tomorrow and I may update my Epinion after that time.

For those of you wondering if I was ever going to say anything decent about the Elantra, don't blink!  In the city the Elantra seems competent enough.  It handles quite nicely, with a very sharp turning radius at slow speeds.  And the transmission seems smoother and quieter.  Gas mileage is now a greater concern though.

Those of you looking for something affordable for the city with some extra room may find the Elantra acceptable.  Larger families, small businesses and the sort may see the Elantra as an economical choice.  For those of you, like us, not wishing to give up a more positive, past driving experience may want to thoroughly test drive this vehicle or look elsewhere.  As for us, we're waiting to see what the results are from the shop over the next few days before making a final decision on whether to take a small loss on this purchase and trade it in for something else by another manufacturer.  Maybe something with a little more 'pep'...
