               I went searching for a digital camera for Christmas of 1999 and my search ended when I found the Toshiba PDR-M4. After much reading and research, I knew I wanted a camera for under $500 with a USB interface and one capable of 2 megapixels or greater for &quot;photo quality&quot; pictures. Lucky me, I found the Toshiba PDR-M4 2.1 megapixel at Best Buy on sale for $399 and its givin me nothing but smiles since :-). And I used the other $100 I had allowed myself to purchase an extra 16mb Smartmedia memory card and the extended warranty.  Six different image size and quality settings allow for great flexibility. &quot;Low quality&quot; setting allows you to store HUNDREDS of pictures on a 16mb Smartmedia, but even the &quot;low quality&quot; pictures are quite good. The high quality photos are simply outstanding and you will not be able to distinguish them from normal photos!
   Tons of super features: 
&gt; auto/flash/macro/self-timer
&gt; multi-mode
&gt; burst-mode
&gt; color/black-and-white 
coupled with the USB interface and a great price make this a very smart purchase for anyone in the market for a quality digital camera.

p.s. for anyone looking to buy a digital camera...DO NOT buy one that uses a serial interface to transfer images to your PC. Believe me when I say you will be very disappointed at the slow transfer rate. USB interface is definately the way you want to go.
