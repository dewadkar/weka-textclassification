            My first entry into Digital photography came about when I needed to upload pictures of products I sold on the internet. At times I got what I wanted from my old desktop scanner and at other times it was pure frustration! I wanted a quick and easy way to get my pictures, edit it the way I wanted people to see my product and upload it on the internet. I chose the Ricoh RDC-300 it looked like the answer. This was not one of those little conference type cameras nor was it an upper bracket model.
It fell right into the $400 medium price range and that was about what I wanted to spend. The fun started after I got it out of the box, loaded the software in my computer and assigned the com-2 port for the camera. You can select 3 levels of picture quality, (E) allows you to shoot up to 100 pictures, (N)up to 50 pictures and (F) shoots 25 of the much finer detail pictures. For my purpose I chose the 50 picture mode as the color and the details are good enough for my purpose. The camera's LCD color display is quite adequate, the simplicity of the camera controls are a plus and the macro lens adjust makes very small items look really sharp and clear. On the minus side - I did not buy an external power supply, and this camera does go through AA batteries till I finally bought two sets of rechargeable batteries to solve the need. Uploading pictures to my computer and cropping or enhancing the them with Ricoh's supplied software Photostudio Lite is simple. All the pictures are in the JPEG format which makes it great all around. In short I love the camera but if I had only spent a little more to get the next model up, it has zoom lens!<br><br>
