            My first experience with Saturn was back in 1995 when I was looking for a new car after graduating from college and starting a new job.  I settled on a green 1996 SL2 with most of the proverbial bells and whistles.  As a testament to Saturn, I still own this car, with 144,000 miles with very few problems.  

My experience with Saturn the Company and my local Retailer Saturn of Worcester (they're called "Retailers" and not "Dealers") was the #1 reason I came back to purchase my second Saturn.  This time, I purchased the 2001 SC2 3-Door coupe.  

To tell you the truth, I'd been dying to buy this car since the 1997 model year when they changed the platform for the SC to the larger one, and restyled it.  The 1996 SC was not very appealing to me, and the change to the larger platform was a plus.  The 2001 was again restyled from the 2000 model year, giving the coupe a more aggressive look (IMO), and updating the interior.  The choice was more than just styling, however.  There are a lot of nice attributes the SC2 offers.  Here are some points about the SC2:

<b>Performance.</b> People don't consider Saturns to have "performance", but you'd be surprised with this engine.  It's a 1.9L I-4 with 124Hp.  Not that big, and essentially the same design as the one in the first Saturn that rolled out of  Spring Hill (other than some sound-deadening changes in 1998).  You have to remember that the car is essentially a compact car, so it's light, and the engine can really move it.  Plus, the engine was tuned with more torque than other compacts (i.e. Civics and Corollas).  Torque translates into acceleration, which means some great pickup off the (stop) line.  Also, the car has a lot of pickup at any speed, including at 70mph in 5th gear.  Mate the engine with a Manual instead of the optional Automatic transmission, and you have a very agile, quick car.  

<b>Handing.</b>  The SC2 has differences that lower, less expensive SC1 model, including a different rear sway bar inclusive of the "sport-tuned" suspension.  The car really handles well around corners, and is very stable at any speed.  In the winter, the front wheel drive and manual transmission makes winter driving a lot easier.  I got the optional ABS and Traction Control which works well in most cases (there is an "off" button for times where it isn't necessary).

<b>Comfort.</b> The first thing my sister said when she sat in the car is, "I love these seats, they're so comfortable."  The front seats are very comfortable, with padding that really conforms to your body (unlike the hard seats in the imports).  I drive an hour to and from work each day, and I find that the seats are very comfortable for long drives.  The rear is a little cramped, but you'd expect that in a coupe.  The third door helps with access (more on that below) for people and items.

<b>Roominess.</b> In a compact car space is a limited resource.  The designers of the SC2's interior made use of the space in a very nice way.  There is enough room for an average person to drive, maybe a taller person would have issues.  The rear has plenty of space to stack and store stuff.  The trunk is HUGE, and can fit a lot of things as well (golf clubs, hockey sticks, tools, etc.).  The rear seats are 60-40 split seats, which can be folded down to carry longer items.  For a compact, it can hold a lot of junk (just ask my wife who loves to pack the car full of stuff).

<b>SC2 Package and Standard Equipment.</b> One thing Saturn did was to make certain options standard on the 2001 SC2.  Air conditioning, power locks, power windows, power mirrors, cruise control, fog lamps, security system, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel are all standard.  ABS and traction control is not standard, and alloy wheels were also an added expense.  Also, the floor mats were a $70 option, which really burned my father when I last bought a Saturn... I can still hear his words now - "You mean he's buying an $18K car and you can throw in the FLOOR MATS for free?"  I really wasn't a big deal for me, but he's old fashioned.  The base radio is an AM/FM radio with in-dash CD player, made by Panasonic - very nice sound for a factory base system.

<b>Safety.</b> Saturn prides itself for it's safety record.  For the last couple years the S-Series has done very well in the government and insurance institute crash tests.  With front and rear crumple zones, anti-submarining seats and steel frame construction, the S-Series holds up in a crash.  And for the first time side-impact airbags are an option in the S-Series.

<b>Fuel Efficiency.</b> I've been getting anywhere from 32 to 35 mpg, while doing mostly highway driving.  By comparison, my 96 SL2 has been getting 37 to 39 mpg recently.

<b>The Third Door.</b> One of Saturn's pitches was "Why didn't anyone think of this before?"  I was wondering the same thing.  Getting in and out of a coupe is tough, but the third door makes it easier.  The third door is a smaller door behind the driver's door, that opens toward the back of the car, and has the latch handle hidden in the door frame itself.  You can't open the door when the driver's door is closed.  I can slide my hockey sticks and equipment bag into the back seat without struggling with the driver's seat or the seat belt.  A handy addition.  And, it doesn't take away from the structural safety of the car.

<b>Reliability/Dependability.</b> Some magazines have said that the S-Series reliability is a perception thing, where the customer is lulled into believing that Saturns are just as or more reliable than other compacts.  I know that, regardless of the car type you buy, some people will get a car that can run 400k miles, and others will get one that will need the engine replaced after 20k miles.  From what I've experienced with my first car, Saturn's reliability is right up there.  I've never been stranded with my SL2, and I have yet to run into an issue with my SC2.  They have problems, just like other automakers.  But the way Saturn (usually) handles issues is what sets them apart (see No Haggle, No Hassle below).

<b>Dent-Resistant Door Panels.</b> My SL2, almost 6 years old now, looks like it is only 1-2 years old.  I can't imagine what the doors would look like from other people opening their doors into mine (based on small scratches) what the car would look like.  This has certainly added to my resale and cost of ownership (see below) for my SL2.  My SC2 is equipped with the same plastic dent resistant vertical panels, so I expect the same to be true.

<b>Cost of Ownership.</b> Besides changing the oil regularly (I'm using Mobil 1 synthetic since my first oil change) and adding regular 87 octane gasoline, and normal wear-and-tear items like wiper blades and filters, my SL2 has been very inexpensive to own.  With the great gas mileage, I save a bundle there too.  But where I see the biggest difference between the SC2 and the Civic or Corolla is the insurance cost.  Civics and Corollas are notoriously always on the Top 10 stolen cars list, which makes the insurance rates go up.  Also, because the SC2 has those plastic panels, dents and dings don't occur often, and costs for repair are low.

<b>Resale Value</b> This is always one of the largest selling points with Saturn.  My SL2 has 144k miles on it, and it is still worth $3500, based on an original cost in 1995 of $17K.  By comparison, one of the other cars I owned (and wrote an opinion about here on Epinions), a Hyundai Accent, was only worth $500 when I was going to trade it in - it was in average shape and had 95k miles on it.  But that's kinda like apples and oranges.  In any case, I know that my new SC2 will keep its value over its life until I decide to get a 2006 SC2!

<b>Financing Options.</b> I was going to get a Saturn whether they had a financing deal or not, but the financing offer they had made the deal sweeter.  I had the option of getting 1.9% for 3 years, 3.9% for 4 years, or 6.9% for 5 years, through Chase bank.  This financing was made available through the Retailer.  I chose 3.9% for 4 years, and I'll save about $1000 over the  5 year option.

<b>No Haggle, No Hassle.</b> This is the main reason Saturn is high on J.D. Power's list of Initial Quality and Customer Satisfaction surveys.  I can walk into the Retailer and I feel like I'm not being pressured to buy a car.  The associates there are trained to help you buy a car, and not sell one to you (there is a difference).  I can walk up to any car in the lot and look at the window sticker and know that this is the price I'm going to pay for the car.  Some people would rather make the Dealer squirm and negotiate a deal.  Some people aren't that savvy (like me), and like the fact that the price that they paid for the car is exactly the same as the next customer.  Both times I left the Retailer with my new cars I didn't feel like I was ripped off or could have "talked him down" to a better price.  That piece of mind goes a long way.

I did have some problems with the new car, which I purchased in February 2001.  The car has 13,500 miles on it; these are the problems so far:

* The radio died about a month after I got the car.  They replaced it under warrantee the SAME DAY.
* There is a sound coming from the rear of the car when I hit a bump, like the muffler is striking the heat shield.
* My front brake rotors are starting to warp(!).

The last two items I'm having evaluated soon.  The other complaint I have is the length of the warrantee. They only give a 3 year/36k mile warrantee, where other car makers are increasing that to 5/50 or even 10/100.  I think Saturn could attract more people if they increased the term.  As a note, I bought an extended warrantee for 6 years/ 100k miles.

Overall, the car has been very solid and fun to drive.  I love driving it!  We already have our third Saturn on our list, the new 2002 VUE SUV.  I'll let you know how that goes.

<i>DISCLAIMER: I have NOT been assimilated by Saturn, and I don't go to picnics sponsored by my local Saturn Retailer every weekend.  Besides, resistance is futile.</i>  ;)
