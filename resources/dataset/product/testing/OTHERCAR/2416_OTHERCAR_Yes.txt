            This truck has been very dependable. The 4-wheel drive has given me a sense of security I have never felt in another vehicle. 
We are a single-income family with 2 small children. (It will not fit more than 2 child car seats in the back, unless one is a small booster.) I love the fact that we have an advantage over most other drivers in bad weather. I can see better because I'm sitting higher and I don't have to worry about getting stuck in the snow, mud or what have you. I wouldn't trade that peace of mind for anything. However, the back seat does not accommodate adults very well. I am not comfortable sitting in the back and I am only 5'4&quot;.
We have had this Jeep for 5 years and have only replaced parts that have worn down from routine use: tires, brakes, headlights, etc.<br><br>
