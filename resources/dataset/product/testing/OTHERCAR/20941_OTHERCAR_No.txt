            Okay lets start off by talking about another car which could be classified as a fad, the Volkswagon Beetle.  People went bonkers for these things when they came out paying over sticker and paying top dollar for used ones.  Guess what the honeymoon is over!  These cars are a tough, tough sell on a used car lot and are covering dealer lots everywhere.  People have realized the golf is a better car for less money.  
People are again paying top dollar for the PT Cruiser and not realizing what they are actually getting.  Unlike the Volkswagon which has never been known for super reliability, chyrsler makes the volkswagons look like a Honda in comparison.  I can't even imagine owning a car with a neon engine that can hold seven people.  I hope there aren't too many hills where you live because you might need to get out and push this thing up them if you do carry seven passengers.  The chassis is an extended Neon as well.  
This car is basically a longer version of the neon with a fancy shell that sometimes costs more than twice as much as its sibling.  When the market crashes on these things in a year or two many people especially the ones who paid over sticker are going to be buried in these things even worse than the neons.  
Lets talk about that neon engine/powertrain.  First of all just like all chrysler products it is prone to have both headgasket and transmission problems.  Neither of these problems is a cheap fix and its awful when your car is in the shop for a long time.  When people start having problems with their 25k cruiser I hope chrysler doesn't abandon them like it seems to do with its other customers.  
I have been selling cars for more than 2 years now and I have seen the ins and outs of this business and this is a stern warning, because when the market falls on this car it will fall fast and hard so get out now.
