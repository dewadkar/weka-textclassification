            After owning a 2001 Audi A4 for a few months I decided to step up to an S4. When owning the A4, I thought nothing in its price range could even come close. I was right! The A4 was outclassed by a high powered clone of itself, though. For a small premium over the A4, you can own its big brother, the S4. All it took to bring this car into an elite field of players was an extra seventy horsepower, and some fancy badges. The exterior is almost indistinguishable from the A4, except for the revised front end...but that is not a bad thing, by any means. The interior is also a forte of this machine. I opted for the blue suede seat inserts that add much to the life of the interior. 

Once in the driver's seat, you'll discover the true meaning of greased lightning. The best part, though, is that there are no garish indications of this car being so speedy. This makes you nearly invisible to cops...they'd rather stop the red Pontiac in the next lane. 

The handling is neutral and composed at all times. You could probably drive effortlessly through hairpin turns at speeds near triple digits. Audi's famous Quattro drivetrain will help you drive like a pro, and the six speed manual is a plus, too. The structure is tight as a drum, and it feels much more substantial than the new Mercedes C-Class. You can't possibly say enough about the performance of this car. It darts to 60 mph in about five seconds flat! Unsuspecting people in thier "slammed" cars are not prepared for me at the stoplight! 

Like the A4, everything in the car displays a sort of finesse not found in other cars. The switchgear and levers are actually fun to play with, and the interior is ergonomically sound. The seat heaters are potent, and the air conditioner could cool a large room. The red hue radiating from the numbers on the dash and instrument cluster is a nice touch; easy on the eyes and legible. 


Almost all other things about the A4 apply to this German wonder (See my review of the A4 to learn more about both the S4 and A4)...I've never seen anything closer to perfection. Just like another reviewer, I feel that if this car was a female, I would not hesitate to marry it.
