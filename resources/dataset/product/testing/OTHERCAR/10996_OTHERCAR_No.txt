            My husband and I traded in a 1993 Ford Aerostar for a 2000 Chevrolet Astro van because we wanted to get into a newer model and felt like the move to a Chevrolet would be a good one.  We have nine children (not all at home!) and need a van for most travel.  We spent a great deal of time researching new vans and felt comfortable with the Astro as our final decision.  We loved the roomy interior and the cargo net in the back.  We also liked the overhead display of temp., direction, mpg, and total fuel usage.  However, the lustre of these &quot;goodies&quot; began to dim almost from day one. <br> On the first day of ownership, we heard scrubbing near the right front tire.  We found a trim piece of the front bumper hanging by one bolt on the left side.  When we took the vehicle back to the dealership, we found that no hole had even been drilled on the right side to attach this trim.  About two days later, while going down our sloping drive, a large bolt and nut from who knows where came off the roof and rolled down the hood.  We never found where this came from.  Within 200 miles, the van began to creak and squeak.  We do not live on a rough road, nor do we drive in any rural areas, so we did not feel the squeaks could be explained by driving conditions.  They also were not consistent with any particular event encountered on the highway.<br><br> After two months of ownership, other things began to go wrong.  An armrest fell off the driver's seat, and all the rubber liners in the cup holders came out of their glued positions.  The squeaking worsened and seemed to be worst around the rear doors.<br><br>We decided after three months to get out of this vehicle and really wish that we had kept our '93 Aerostar!!  Unfortunately, we will be stuck with this until we are no longer upside down on our loan.  Future buyers beware!<br><br><br><br>
