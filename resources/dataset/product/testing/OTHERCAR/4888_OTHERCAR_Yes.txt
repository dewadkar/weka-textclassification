            <b>Size & Weight</b>
First off, the size of this multi-function contraption is amazing.  A digital camera able to produce such quality and yet fit in the palm is unheard of.

A plus (+) to the size and weight of the camera is that, due to its size, it can fit in most pockets, and you hardly even feel the 9 oz. (w/ battery and Memory Stick - more on that later) in your pocket.

Sony has undergone a massive change from their Mavica's, and shrinking down to their Cybershots, and yet still shrinking in the Cybershot category to the P1, in both size and weight.  Much props to Sony for this amazing breakthrough!

<b>Ease of Use</b>
If I were to rate at what skill level this camera should be used by, it fits the: <b>Beginner</b>.  This camera is very simple to use, especially with its convenient 1.5" LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) on the back of the camera.  Sure, it's smaller than its predecessors with the 2" LCD's, but it provides sharp quality and clarity.  Plus, because this camera comes with a viewfinder, there is no need for constant use of the LCD (which drains batteries faster), as you would need if you had a Sony Mavica or other Cybershot (as of 12/11/00).

Once I got this thing out of the box, I looked in the manual to find how to charge the Sony InfoLithium (very helpful - more on that later) battery and keep it working at optimal performance.  Once I had found this, I plugged it into the AC and eagerly waited the finish of its charging (relatively quick - 130min. for a regular charge, 180min. for full charge).  After looking up information about the battery, I closed the manual and waited...Finally, the thing finished charging, and from there on out, I hardly had to pick up the manual again...only to look at advanced features, which shows just how easy this camera is to use!  (Sure, I'm good at new technology stuff, but was just TOO easy :)).

<b>Battery - Sony InfoLithium</b>
<b>Another</b> amazing feature!

This camera is just loaded!  It comes with Sony's new technology of Sony InfoLithium batteries.  This is a very user friendly Lithium-Ion (the best - will maintain its life for the life of the camera) battery, because when you charge it, it will show the indicator of how many bars are charging and such, and it will also show, as it is charging, the amount of time this battery will last.  This is a great feature so you can estimate when your charging will be done in case you have any important errands to attend to.

<i>Life of the Battery</i>
To me, this battery could be better, despite the fact that it is pretty good now.  According to Sony, there is up to 90 min. battery life (but this is with LCD and Flash off).  I feel that I am recharging the battery a lot more than I should be for a such a high-priced camera.  One negative to the battery is that, because LCDs do drain the battery, you can't constantly keep the LCD on if you want more time to shoot.

<b>Sony Memory Stick</b>
And yet...<b>Another</b> great feature!

Sony now uses their Memory Sticks on all their digital equipment now.  This is a very convenient form of storage because it is universal amongst the Sony world.

A con is that they only give you an 8 MB Memory Stick; I feel that they should at least give you a 16 MB one because of the price you're paying anyway, but that's just me.  An 8 MB Memory Stick will only fit approximately 5-6 pictures at the highest resolution.  This is an almost guarantee that you will be required to purchase a larger Memory Stick if you wish to travel light when shooting, probably a 64MB one, which retails at $140, I think.

One convenience is that, if you have a Sony Vaio Laptop, you can simply plug in your Memory Stick into the slot provided, and you can instantly view the pictures taken.

<b>Lens</b>
Sony's lens is made with incredible technology!

It has a 6x Precision Digital Zoom (3x Optical Zoom, 2x Digital Zoom).

This is an interesting feature, because, if you're not close enough, you're still close enough.  The Zoom is pretty good for this camera.  The digital zoom (which Sony recommends you not use whenever possible because it blurs the image), is OK...Sony could improve that feature a bit.  Another con to digital zoom is that only optical zoom appears in the viewfinder.

A plus to this camera is that it can take pics in Macro mode (things up close).  This is very helpful if you are using this to sell items (like on eBay and such), and you need a close zoom of an object to point out its detail.

<b>Advanced Features</b>
Like I said before, this camera is <b>Loaded</b>!

The P1 offers many interesting features to choose from:

<i>MPEG Movie</i>
This is probably one of their best features.  You can record 5-10-15 second video clips and play them back in the industry standard (MPEG) format on your personal computer.  This is good when you don't want to spend the money on a camcorder and just want to record short clips.

<i>Clip Motion</i>
Clip Motion is a good feature to use if you own a home page.  Otherwise, I haven't really found a use for it.  Basically, you take some pictures in Clip Motion mode and it will combine them together to display the pictures at short intervals, to give the illusion of movement, in another industry standard form (GIF).  If you find good use of this feature, please feel free to let me know.

<i>Other Options</i>
There are some interesting options for taking pictures and movies.  There are different effects you can choose.  I haven't yet found a way to use all of these features, but I'm sure there are ways.  Effects include, but are not limited to: Sepia, Black & White, Solarize, Negative.  These work good if you like to make your own art.

Another plus is that it offers a built in software in which you can resize the photo or rotate it, which comes in handy when you don't want to export the photo just to rotate it.  I cannot rate the software at this time because I have Adobe Photoshop and have not found any reason to waste space on my computer.  Maybe I will someday...

<b>Negatives</b>
Though the P1 is probably the best camera in the world :), there are some things that could be better.  For the price, they could at least include:

Carrying case
Higher-capacity Memory Stick

Otherwise, overall, this is a great camera and I haven't been wronged for what I paid.  This camera may not be totally worth its money, but enough to enjoy it for what it's worth.

*Updated 4.22.01*
After being able to use this camera for 5 months, I have had a lot of time get to know it better :).  Here are my views:

<b>Design</b>
Well, just about everywhere I go, I turn a couple of heads.  The reason is probably because this camera is SO small, yet so stylish and functional.  Of course, once people see it, they ask about it.  The most common question being, "Wow, that thing is small!  How much did that cost?"  Many are amazed for various reasons: digital camera, size, silver mixed with navy blue proves to be a nice combination that draws attention.  Being pocket-sized, the P1 gives me the benefit of simply putting the camera in my pocket, and whenever a quick snapshot is needed, just point and shoot.

<b>Concept of Digital Still Cameras</b>
I have grown, as many probably have or will, accustomed to my digital camera and never stop to think what I would do if I had regular film.  Would I be able to retake this picture?  Well, of course, but with a sacrifice.  Once you get a digital camera, you know you sacrifice all the neat features of a typical camera (MUCH further zoom lens, control over your shots, etc.), but while you sacrifice, you benefit from all the additional features a digital camera has: digital pictures-not film, LCD screen - look at what you're shooting and many others.

<b>Durability</b>
Well, not really to my choice, I have banged the digital camera around a bit.  I have even gone as far as to dropping it onto a road, however, being that I was low to the floor, it only suffered minor scratches.  After all these "occurrences," it still works as if I had bought it yesterday.  This just goes to show Sony's durability of their products, including this one.

After 5 months of use of this camera, I am still very pleased with the decision I made to buy this camera!  It is a truly valuable investment!
