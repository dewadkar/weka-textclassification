            Our QV3000EX is a great camera, and was worth the cost when we purchased it shortly after the model was announced.  Many reviewers here and elsewhere point out all the great features, no need to repeat them here.

That said, I'd like to relate a recent experience with Casio regarding a service question.  An email was sent to their service organization that said our camera was NOT in need of service at this time, but service considerations were important as we consider purchasing a second digital camera for family use.  References in the manual to the fluorescent light source that provides the backlighting to the rear panel view screen that it is necessary to send the camera to Casio should that source fail are what prompted my request for information on service costs.  

The first response advised that I should send the camera in if it needed service.  It was obvious that the person responding did not bother to read the three of four lines in the request...so I highlighted the two points that we did not need service now, but wanted pricing information, and fired off the response.  I also called their customer service group, and since it was the first time, they wanted to enter my name in their database.  One of the items they requested was home address...and I never did get a response as to why that was required to answer a question about the camera.  

The rep did not know the answer to the question but did provide a phone number (201 329 9030).  Calling that number, following a wait of under 10 minutes, a technician said there is a flat fee for ANY repair and it is $250.  Later in the day, I received a response to my second email that also said all service work was priced at $250.  

Discounters are offering a new camera for approximately $500 these days; that means an out of warranty repair costs you half your purchase price.  That seems a bit pricey to me, and I've asked a new question, "Does this mean you fix the camera or send a new or repaired unit back?"  Casio has not had time to respond yet.

The basic message here is that part of the cost of owning a high tech product is service costs, and manufacturers don't seem willing to publish information on their web sites or in their documentation that addresses those costs.  And, according to Casio verbally and in writing, if the plastic battery compartment door breaks, you're out $250!!!!!!!
---------Undated information on 8/31/01---------

A further excrucuiatingly painful effort to extract the truth from Casio's Repair Center revealed the following:

(1)  The $250 flat fee for service applies ONLY if they need to get inside the camera to perform repairs.  Therefore replacing the external battery door would not subject a customer to the fee.  Their note said "we sell parts."  Perhaps the battery door can be replaced by the customer.

(2)  When asked if the camera is irreparable, what do they send out as a replacement, a refurb or new unit the answer was that they send a new one.

(3)  They DO make an attempt to repair the camera prior to determining that it needs to be replaced.

Their policy lends itself to customers potentially damaging a unit so badly that Casio has to replace it after they learn that a trip to the repair facility costs $250.  

(4)  I contacted Canon, manufacturer of the G1, quoted in reviews as being similar to the QV3000, and was told that they evaluate each returned item and then provide an estimate to the customer.  They said they do not have a flat fee repair policy.

To improve battery charge life and increase durability while traveling, I purchased a 256 meg flash card for $121 on the net (in two days the price from newegg.com has come down to less than that).  Two day FedEx shipping was $5.  Have yet to take enough shots to determine the efficiency of using the card, it will hold 178 high definition 3.3 megapixel images.

--------End of 08/31/01 update ----------

When I factor potential repair costs into owning my QV3000EX, maybe it wasn't such a good deal after all, and I KNOW that I'll look at other brands when considering a second camera despite all the good things Casio may offer.  

Hopefully publishing this kind of information will wake someone in Casio management up to the lunacy of their service policies.  Let's hope so.
