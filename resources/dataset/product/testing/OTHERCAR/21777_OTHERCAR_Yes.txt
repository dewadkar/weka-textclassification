            This car is so nice to drive. its a smooth ride with very comfortable seats. the gas milage is great too! about 28mpg. this car has plenty of get up and go to get out on freeways, yet it is still pretty quiet when punching the gas. at 2000rpm's this is a very quiet car. the standard stero is good too, although i couldnt resister upgrading to a cd changer. the speakers are good, with two tweeters in front, 4&quot; 3-ways in door and rear speakers. this car lacks a little in the cargo area but is still enough to cram alot of stuff into. my trunk is a sports trunk....w/ sports equipment from tennis to football...so that im always prepared:) the civic also has great handling on curvey roads, and the seats hold you real well going around a curve.<br><br>
