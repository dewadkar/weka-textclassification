            Until recently, I have been driving a Geo Tracker.  Although I LOVE that car (we still have it), it's just not a family vehicle.  When I went Christmas shopping, I had no room to take home my load of goodies!  That was the last straw, and we began car shopping.

I chose the Chevrolet Malibu solely on size and looks.  A lot of cars look o.k. from the front, but the back end is ugly, or the other way around.  The Chevrolet Malibu looks sleek from all angles.  I had pretty much decided that I wanted a Malibu before the test drive.

A major concern for me was having enough room in the vehicle.  I have a two year old daughter, so I needed to have easy access to the back seat - No problem for the Malibu.  I also wanted to have enough room in the trunk for groceries, etc.  Again, no problem.  My husband is quite tall and needs a lot of leg room.  Once again, no problem.  I must admit that I do expect for my two step children to be a little cramped in the back when they visit this summer.

I have had very good luck with the car in the recent snow storms we've had.  It seems to handle very well considering it's not 4 wheel drive.

I have no regrets in purchasing this vehicle!  Love it!  Love the features (electric windows, locks, sunroof, CD player, etc.)  <br><br>
