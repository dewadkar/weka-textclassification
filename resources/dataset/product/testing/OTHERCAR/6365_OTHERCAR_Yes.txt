            I own a 1997 SLP Camaro SS, and gave it to my wife, so I needed something to drive. I was getting the oil changed in the Camaro the day before Thanksgiving, and happened to walk in to the showroom of Miller's Chevrolet-Olds in Hershey, PA, when I saw &quot;IT&quot;. A 2000 Monte Carlo SS in Sebring Silver (same as my Camaro). And that's all it took. 15 minutes later, I drove it off the showroom floor, and 1400 miles to my family's home for Thanksgiving dinner. I am extremely pleased, and above all, a little proud to own it, (to say the least). We just came back from vacation at the Grove Park Inn in Asheville, NC, and I actually sold 3 Monte Carlos while I was there. (I don't work for a dealership). It is the most comfortable, well handling, and sharpest looking car I have ever owned. I recommend it to anyone who likes looks, handling, and comfort.<br><br>
