            We rented the Grand Marquis while relatives were visiting, so all six of us could travel comfortably in the same car.  The Grand Marquis will seat 3 abreast front and rear. It is a powerful car, which rides well while loaded to the hilt.  The brakes are quite effective for this size/type of car.

We realized about 21 mpg combined city/freeway driving in our car, which had about 26,000 miles on the clock when we rented it. Pleasantly surprising. Probably (on a long freeway only trip) capable of 25 or 26 mpg
given the right set of circumstances.

I especially liked the automatic-dimming rear-view mirror, but I felt the placement of the rear-view on the windshield was poor, as it was nearly in the middle of the windshield...about half way between the top of the dash, and where the top of the windshield meets the roof ! And yes, it did block some of the forward vision ! Poor planning.  

A handy feature are the side spotlights, which illuminate the neighboring lane when the turn signal is used. I can see this as a real safety feature which I didn't know existed! Let alone on a generic &quot;Mercury&quot; in a rental fleet.

Also, the stereo controls are too high in the very wide dashboard requiring a lean forward to adjust or turn onn the radio. The stereo system has Cassette and in-trunk 6 disc CD changer. It all sounded good. 
The heating and climate system controls are more conveniently located, where the sound system SHOULD reside. The reason? The climate system can be set and forgotten about for any temp you like....so there's very little to mess with. They should be in the least convenient location, not the sound system!

The car seemed to be in good condition, considering it's life as a rental rig. The carpeting in the very large trunk was falling down off of the sides, and the steering wheel had an aggravating rubbing sound in it when rotating the wheel for parking.  A definite shop-stop for anything but a rented car. 

Also, the younger members of the group would begin to complain about the center-front seating position after awhile, as it was lumpy and uncomfortable for anything but a short jaunt.  Nonetheless, we DID succesfully carry six in this car comfortably (for most of us, anyway).

Anyway, I am impressed with this big cruiser. While not my cup of tea as a permanent ride (not yet anyway!) it is a much nicer car than others I've driven in it's same size and price category.  Next time I rent, (and perhaps someday when I wear plaid pants and white shoes) I'll drive another!<br><br>
