              I had own an 1998 Audi A4 and enjoyed it very much. Audi makes a very reliable and stylish cars. The A4 is handsome, great looking and really stands out in performance. Being the only AWD in its class makes it more perfect. The 2.8 engine with a Tiptronic will never let you down but I have to admit that it doesn't really give you a hit compare to the sequential-shift of Acura 3.2TL. Using the shift in TL and rev it up to 5,500 rpm, you'll really feel the power of the Japanese car. Nevertheless, Audi has very own unique interior(should I say the best looking and design?) even though the back is not very roomy(adults could be cramped). The exterior gets a little touch up here and there every half a year. 
   From 1998 to 2000, there are minor changes for the A4 but the engine and the chassis remain the same and it'll remain that way for another couple of years until the new A4 is due. A4 is very pleasant to drive. It's a fun car with precise handling, good acceleration and catches people's eyes. Why pay so much for a BMW or MB while you can get this perfect car or if you really considering a real performer, go with the S4.<br><br>
