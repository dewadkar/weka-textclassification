               I was forced to buy a car.  I didn't know how much I could afford, what kind of car to get, nothing! I went out and about and looked at a lot of different cars. Well my sister knew someone who worked at local Acura dealer and I went there. They offered many new and used cars. They rolled this one out of the back just out of wash and new to the lot actually. It had 15,000 miles on it at the time. It looked pretty sharp but overall had a cute look to it. They gave me a great deal on it! But little did I know what it had in store for me.

   I can say I used the car a lot. I also was the type that beat on it. I did take great care of it (oil changes, tune up, etc...). The car drove heavy mileage the first few years I owned it. The majority of the miles were highway. To and from work was all highway and quite a few long road trips for vacations and every weekend up to the local race tracks for the race team I was in. The gas mileage was shocking! I could easily get about 40 miles on the highway on the long road trips. That is keeping the car in over drive and hauling butt too! The car ran quiet, smooth and handled pretty great on dry roads. 

   But! There is always a but isn't there? Within 32,000 miles the right rear wheel bearing wore itself out. I replaced myself. No big deal, though it shouldn't wear out that quickly. Then the car reached about 64,000 miles. I heard the all too familiar sound of the right rear wheel bearing again. Within a week after first hearing the hum, I had both rears actually fall into pieces off the car at the same time heading back to work on my lunch break! Luckily I was only 1 mile from a local shop who took it in for me. So, now, it cost me of course!

   And let me talk about the computer sensors! By 40,000 miles I began having trouble restarting my car once I was out and about with it. I would get to work, a store, or what not and try and restart it to leave a short time later and couldn't. At times being stranded for over an hour! But it usually after time started! I took it to 4 different places who could never pin point the problem! I finally called the dealer (I hate dealers they just rip you off) and they told me right away what it was! They said they seen it quite a few times. It was actually two burned out computer sensors that were telling the car it was too hot to start! Go figure right? Needless to say it cost my just $1,000 to fix! But I haven't the trouble since! 

   Then I got to about 75,000 miles and ran into my next problem. I would pull up to a light or stop sign and the car would stall out. I would keep in neutral and stand on it to keep it running. I also had low power when it came to head lights and the interior dash lights. Yes, this ended up being my alternator. So that cost me to have replaced. I haven't had any trouble since though with it. 

   So there you have it. Are all these problems needed in a car? I don't think so. I think they needed to look at the design in the rear axle or something for a defect for the wearing in the wheel bearings. And I think they needed to take a look at the sensors since they seemed to know all about it and obviously seen this happen quite a bit! 

   As for the good points of this car. It gets great gas mileage. It rides comfortable. It rides quiet (until the wheel bearing wears!). It handles great. The A/C works great. The stock radio is loud and pretty clear! The heat always worked a little too good for me (LOL). The interior is small and not made for long trips for anyone in the back seats! It is a decent size in the front for you though. 

   More points about the car. The parts! Sheesh! Try and get an oil filter or air filter or wiper blades or even a simple head light! You go into any store (auto parts, normal store, etc) and look up the part in the book. ALWAYS the wrong part and size listed! You either have to know your parts or go to the dealer who charge an arm and a leg!

   And the one other point of the car... it doesn't agree to well with rainy weather (Even if you have the best of tires) or wind! You find yourself being tossed about in the breeze like a balloon drifting around. And get next to a truck and you can feel the wind pull air off the car and throw you some. Kind of scary at first if you are doing 80 or more and feel it for the first few times! Yes I drive fast.. the car can take that!

   As for speed. The car picks up pace pretty well for a four banger! I topped mine just over 100 when it only had 15,000 on it when I first got it. I hit 100 and backed down. Don't think I was going to get any faster though! It is better picking up speed with a small running start! It actually gets up most hills quite well, but not the long never ending highway ones! And when you pull out to pass a car with some speed behind you... the get up and go from say 55- 70 to pass quickly is real good! LOL! But I don't let the cops read this! LOL! BUT! There is that but again! If you have the A/C on- forget everything I just said. The car is like a snail with the A/C on! Nothing more to say there! 

   As for breaking. Well it stops! I never hit anyone from behind and I tend to be a tail gate person! The breaks have normal wear time in them. Some cars can eat breaks alive. 

   Overall... I like my cute little car! I even fit in nice tiny parking places where most can't! But would I buy it again if I know now everything? Nope! Maybe it was a lemon? Maybe it is just a few pieces of metal that never should have been made into a car? I don't know... But hope you have better luck than with mine! 

   I don't think there is much to say about it... So i will quit my babble...  Take care.... drive on!
