            In my opinion, this SUV gives the best bang for your buck in the entire class.  The exterior is beautiful, and the selection of exterior colors are ALL very nice.  The interior trim pieces have a nice tight fit.  The ride is very good.  The ride is almost as good as the 01 Town and country I traded in for it.  The Town and country is known for it's nice ride, by the way.  It is very quiet on the highway.  Cargo/people space is impressive.  In this class, the only SUV that competes with the interior space is the Tribute.  Everything else is cramped in comparison.  Traction is great, 2.7 engine is adequate.  Not over or under powered.  Sport shift transmission is fun to drive.  4 wheel disc brakes give plenty of stopping power.  Stock radio is nice sounding and has a 200 watt amplifier.  Lots of little nooks to store stuff.  BEST car I've ever had, and I've had too many to count.  We bought this because of the features to price ratio (high in our opinion), and the need for space.  The beautiful lines of the exterior cemented our choice.  It's been only 3500 miles, and 5 months, but so far (knock wood) nothing is wrong.  Everyday we feel certain we made the right choice, no remorse for us. Hyundai corporate has contacted us twice for input and to see if we are happy.  Nice touch.
