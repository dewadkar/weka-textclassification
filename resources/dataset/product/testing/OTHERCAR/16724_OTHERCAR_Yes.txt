            We purchased a green 1993 dodge caravan after I had my fourth child for only $1700.00 at a used car dealer. I thought the price was too low and thought it needed repairs but after we test drove it we quickly bought it because it was in excellent conditions. Since we loved the minivan which had a 3.3l v6 engine so much someone stole it a week later. When we got it back we had to replace the window and ignition switch the thief broke. We drove it again for like a week after it was recovered the transmission went and so we went in for an estimate. The estimate was for the total repair and rebuild of the transmission at $1400.00. I asked why the hell was it so expensive and because it has overdrive which I didnt know a thing about and that was why the transmission was so expensive to repair.So I think that if you can find a dodge caravan for a cheap price then it would be worth fixing a few problems.
