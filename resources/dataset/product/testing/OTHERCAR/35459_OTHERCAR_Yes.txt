            I have never been a fan of Sony Digital Cameras for two reasons. One is the fact that it only uses their own proprietary memory stick (costs at least 2-3 times that of compact flash or smart media). Two, its always been over priced for its feature set.

For this camera, I made the exception. The reason that I made an exception is because of the feature set found in this camera that is not in any other digital camera out there. So lets go over its unique features and you can decide whether or not you wish to pay extra for these.

1. Infra-Red Night Vision. Yes, you actually get to take pictures in total darkness. Of course, you get green grainy shots much like those you saw from the Gulf War, but hey, better than nothing. Really cool gimick stuff, I mean, what a better way to impress your friends.

2. Hologram Focus. During low lighting conditions, the lens will emit a hologram matrix onto the subject for faster and more accurate focus. If you've ever tried to take a picture in poorly lit situations, you'll remember that your camera will take extra long time to get the auto-focus right (and a lot of times wrong). With Hologram matrix focus, even in complete darkness you can still focus correctly so the flash can do its job after you press that shutter.

3. Double LCD display. It has your traditional LCD display at the back of the camera. But what makes it unique is that it has another small one inside the view finder. What's the purpose? Well, if you've ever noticed about digital cameras, the frame you see through the viewfinder is always not exactly the same as what you would see when viewing through the LCD on the back. This is the case because the camera is not an SLR (Single Lens Reflex). The existance of the second LCD inside the viewfinder solves that problem. 

4. 5X zoom. OPTICAL ZOOM, that is. Not many digital cameras out there offer a 5X optical zoom so this is nice. 5X is equivalent of approx 150mm in traditional camera terms. The ultra sharp Carl Zeis lens is also a great selling point. Its a big lens and lets face it, nothing beats size. Lots of light comes in equals great pictures. 

Those are the four main selling points for the camera. If those things sound "COOL" to you, perhaps you might want to consider buying it, if not, then there are plenty of other cameras offering similar abilities/qualities out there for a lower price.

Another good thing that comes the F707 is the famous Sony vivid colors. Most of the pictures taken with the F707 are over-saturated. That's a bad thing right? Not really. In those colors, the green is greener, the red is redder. The result is great looking pictures. But what do you give up? Now the pictures look a little bit like it came out of your United Colors of Beneton shop. I personally love it because it makes my pictures look better than it actually is. And I'm sure your professional photographer will hate it.

Other points worth a brief mention. One is the battery. It includes an excellent info-lithium ion battery. Lasts a long time with LCD on so you won't have much to complain about it. Two is the control layout. For a sophiscated camera, its layout is pretty darn good. If you ever tried to change things in Nikon CP990, you'll enjoy the much better design that Sony's got. Built-in microphone for when recording movies, it includes sounds. 

What bad about this camera then? Well, there are a number of things actually. First of all is the infamous flaw called Blue Flash Syndrome. Its a phenomenon that occurs in certain (almost random) conditions where the picture taken with the flash ON will result in an OVERLY blue-ish tone. This problem has been well documented in a number of digital camera review sites. Apparently it only affects a certain number of cameras in the first batch and supposedly has been fixed. Even if you get one that has not been fixed, you can call Sony Tech Support and they'll fix it for you, but you have to mail it to them (they will cover the shipping costs).

Another issue is with Memory Stick. Included is a 16 Meg Stick, that's worthless and useless on a 5-megapixel camera. So you're stuck with having to buy a 128 meg stick on your own. At today's prices, a 128 meg will cost about $110 give or take a few bucks (depends on if you want Sony Brand or Lexar Brand). A compact flash at 128 megs will cost about $50 (and dropping every week). Doing the math yourself, you'll see you're getting jacked.

The last issue I have is the price. At $999 retail, that's expensive. And if its too expensive for you too, then consider Canon G2, an excellent alternative. You're paying for the stuff that can't be found elsewhere. And those are the only reasons to make an exception to my rule of never buying Sony. 

Conclusion

Only get this camera if infra-red night vision, hologram matrix focusing and 5x zoom are important to you. Or else, there are definate alternatives. Canon S300 will give you great vivid colors too. And if those features are important to you (most probably because of bragging rights), then there are no alternatives to this fine device.
