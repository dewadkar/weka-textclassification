            The 1993 Saturn SC2 was my second car after wrecking my Nissan Sentra. I owned it for a miserable 4 years before finally selling it. I have many complaints about this car and few compliments. I am 5 ft tall and generally have always had compact cars. However, this car in particular was even too small for me. But, that's not my only complaint. Even though I bought the car used, I began having transmission trouble before the first year of ownership was over. I took it to the dealership and had them check it out. Their inspection turned up a negative on finding a problem. Somehow, I continued to have a problem with the tranny the duration of my time with the car. I think it will be easier if I just make a list of pros and cons. They are not listed in any particular order.

Cons:
1. Minimal amount of interior room. There are back seats, but you can't put anyone back there if you want to sit in front.

2. A bar inside the door fell, and I was not able to get out of the driver's side door until I had it repaired.

3. This may not apply to all. Most of the automotive repair shops where I live were not familiar enough with Saturns to work on them because they are still considered fairly new models. This meant I had to drive to the nearest dealership, which happened to be a 40 mile drive for me, to have repairs done on the car.

4. I owned my car for 4 (very long) years. Out of those 4, I put a new alternator in my car each year for 3 years straight.

5. Don't try to roll your power windows down when there's even a thin sheet of ice. It will get stuck, and you will have to drive to work with the window down in 30 degree weather.

6. The E.G.R. valve in my engine was defective and caused me to lose a lot of running power. It also made my car go dead when I made sharp turns or drove in reverse too long.

7. I replaced the water pump on the car twice. They should last at least 5 years.

8. The interior cloth on the roof and seats were not very well constructed or installed. The normal wear and tear for any other car wreaks havoc on the Saturn. The foam inside the seats began showing right before I sold the car. The cloth on the roof separated from the padding, and I had to super glue it back up where I could.

9. I take very good care of the cars I own. I keep them maintained, cleaned, and detailed. My efforts to Armor-All the dash religiously still failed when the dash cracked from sun damage.

10. On a long trip to Florida, I was driving the car with the flow of traffic when white smoke filled the interior cab, under the hood, and the tailpipe was blowing out the same. It turned out to be a loose transmission filter, but it was an ordeal! The tow truck guy had no clue what was wrong.

11. If you have a headlamp burn out, you not only have to replace the entire lamp, but you have to have a special tool to remove/install it.

12. You pay cheap because you get cheap.

Pros:
1. Visits to the dealership are great! You get cookies/donuts, sodas, and a nice waiting area with magazines and a television.

2. It does have an appealing exterior body style. It's a cute car!
