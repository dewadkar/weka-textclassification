            I bought my 1995 Defender 90 used in '97.  I had wanted one since they came to the US in 93 and never believed I would ever own one.  I had Bronco's and Samurai's and even an older Land Rover (1970).  I finally got to where I could barely afford one, and I went for it.

I've always had a flair for the unusual, and enjoying something is almost more important than it's characteristics.  I've had some fun vehicles, but nothing to compare to the D-90.  I've never had a day, hot or cold, that I didn't look forward to driving the D-90.  It manages to make me smile no matter how bad the day.  It just makes you feel that good.  After you start using it for it's intended purpose, it grows from a posession to a cosuming hobby.  Off-road events have become my one hobby.  It is where almost every friend I have is from, and where almost every dollar goes.  I look forward to every next trip as soon as I get done with the one I am on.

That's not to say the D-90 doesn't have it's flaws.  It has nothing to offer outside of it's purpose built nature.  If it's hot, you're hot.  If it's cold, you're cold.  It is so noisy at highway speeds that my wife and I have taken to wearing ear plugs and cranking up the stereo.  Forget conversation.  This is of course assuming you can GET to highway speeds.  You can do things to help, and you get clever at finding solutions to design flaws.  But what it was designed to do, it does very well.

The D-90 is not for everyone, but for those few who just don't care because they have to have one--you couldn't choose better.  It will quickly consume all your attention and it will become a member of the family much like your loyal dog.  Heck, I even own www.d-90.com!!!  Welsome one into your family, it won't let you down.<br><br>
