            I figured the best way to get a convertible was to ask my wife to pick one out.  This was a hands-down winner for both of us.

This thing moves gracefully and powerfully, especially when launching myself onto the on-ramps for the freeways here in Houston.

It's definitely a head-turner.  My wife picked out a maroon color and this goes well with the black rag-top and grey interior.  The interior is designed well for a mid-to-average-sized person, which we both are (5' 6" and 5' 7", both under 180 lbs).  However, our very large friend (rotund) sat in it and had lots of problems getting the seat belt to latch until he leaned the seat back all the way.

Automatic top folds back in about 10 seconds, so switching from covered to topless can be done at a stoplight with no problem.  But make sure you have those 10 seconds, because once the wheels start to move, the rag-top mechanism disengages and you're stuck with a partially-retracted lid, which at best gets a few laughs from your envious fellow drivers and at worst can potentially goof up the hardware.

I noticed that driving through even a slight amount of standing water (i.e. a puddle 3 - 4 inches deep) can cause your shifting to go nuts.  Shifting into the lower gears - 1, 2 - will cause the car to shudder and lurch, until whatever it is that is wet dries off.  Acceleration is understandably affected by this, so this could be a safety issue if you need to get the heck out of someone's way.  I just try to stay away from water -- which is sometimes not avoidable in our loverly Houston streets.

We've had this for a couple of years and have never had any mechanical problems with it.  We change the oil every 3K miles and check the fluids monthly.  I drive about 15 miles a day in a combination of freeway and stop-and-go traffic.  Sometimes the stop-and-go traffic is on the freeway.  :o)

I'm very happy with the 1996 Mitsubishi Eclipse "Spyder" edition.
