            My husband and I owned a 1994 Dodge Intrepid.  We had nearly 200,000 miles on it and decided we should sell it before it died on us.  We didn't have hardly any problems with it at all.  At this time, the newer      s had come out and we kept salivating over them until we finally ended up buying one.  It was about 3 years old when we bought our 1998 Intrepid.  

Pros: It is one of the few passenger cars that will actually hold 6 people.  I have 4 kids.  Didn't want a van.
It is so roomy inside.  I wear a 34" inseam on my pants.  So needless to say I have long legs.  I could not fit into any of the back seats of previous cars that we owned.  Sometimes it was necessary for fussy babies.  That is not a problem with the Intrepid.  Most of my family members that have ridden in it have been impressed with the room.
It also has a huge amount of trunk space.  I can't quite figure out how they can put that much room into the car.  It has an excellent heater and air conditioner.  The radio is so so.  We have replaced it with a CD player and new speakers.  The gas mileage is around 20 mpg or a little more.  Which is pretty good for an average sized car.  We bought ours from a dealership for $8,500 about 2 years ago.  It was a rental car which I wouldn't suggest.  There are a lot of scratches and nicks in it.  Sometimes people don't take good care of things that don't belong to them

Cons:  The only con I could think of is it has 2 spastic windows.  Some days they work, some days they don't.  Another con would be that the way it is designed, there tends to be a blind spot on the back sides when backing up and sometimes switching lanes.
