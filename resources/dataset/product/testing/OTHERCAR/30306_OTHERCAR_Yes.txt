            I bought my 1990 Trooper a year ago because the price was good, and the visibility was great! My husband is 6'3&quot; so headroom is a big concern for us. This truck is large enough to carry my entire family, 3 kids and 2 dogs and still have room for snacks and extra clothes. We bought this vehicle primarily for fun. We go 4-wheeling up in the mountains and do a bit of camping. It's now become our primary vehicle. The 2.6 6-cylinder engine doesn't have the &quot;get up and go&quot; of some larger trucks, but it's certainly good at what it's intended to do. I've taken this truck up into the mountains of New Mexico and Colorado with nary a glance behind me. The only problem I had was when my daughter borrowed it and managed to crack the heads. I discovered that Isuzu parts are expensive and difficult to find, but Chevy heads are exactly the same! I put Chevy heads on it and saved myself a large amount of time, money and trouble. I've got well over 100,000 miles on mine and expect to put at least another 100,000 on it. <br><br>
