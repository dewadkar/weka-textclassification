            I recently had the chance to test out this amazing camera at a local photography show this weekend.  I must say that it is one of the most unique, if not the most capable units I have ever seen and I was truly impressed.  The only noticeable drawback to this device would be the price.  It is set to retail for a whopping four thousand dollars and this almost certainly makes the camera available to only professionals and very serious photographers.  Those who do have the money for this unit (this list doesn't include me)will certainly not be disappointed.

Overall, this camera is special because of the fact that it uses revolutionary new principals and technology.  It encompasses CCD image sensor technology which increases the size of the sensor array and activates fifty percent more sensor area.  This increases the viewing area and allows for more spacious pictures.  The technology creates better image resolution and creates a monstrous 6.1 million megapixels of photo area.  This is truly the future in this area and the Fuji Finepix is the first camera I have seen to utilize it.

Of course this camera also has many other great features and all the expected basic setups.  First of all there are 3 imaging formats and this allows  the user to choose from several different styles of photography and can make for some very interesting shots.  Furthermore, the camera features a preview mode which allows the user to look at shots before using up film on them.  This is a very helpful feature and eliminates poor or unwanted shots.  Finally, the camera offers great shutter speed which allows the user to catch the action as it is happening.

All in all, there really are no drawbacks to this camera other than the amazingly high pricetag.  If you can afford it, it will not let you down.  

Note:  The camera is said to have been released to the public recently; however, I have yet to see any on the market although I'm sure some do exist.  Good luck finding them in stores!
