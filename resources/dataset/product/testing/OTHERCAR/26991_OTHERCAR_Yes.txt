            OK, I agree with the above reviewers, especially the first comment i read...."this camera is crazy!".

Ok, the quick and dirty: BUY THIS if you want a small solid performing convenient use snapshot type of camera with some ummphf.

This is my first digital camera and found it performs very well compared to my SLR which I use for special occasions.

Size: stack together 10 credit cards and that's the size of this camera...no joke. 

Protection: The lens has a protective shutter that is closed when off and open when on. The battery has a latch to keep it in. The SD slot is open to the elements im afraid..no door to close it in, but the SD card inserts flush into the camera. The camera is a Magnesium Alloy I think..and it's tough/light and smudge free.

Features I like: The LCD screen is bright and large enough to see reasonable detail of what u shot. So many preprogrammed exposure settings including sepia and B/W settings. 3 megapixel resolution too. And yes, this has a video setting too where you can record video clips 30 secs at a time. Easy to use included docking base. Put camera on and voila!..files DL automatically and camera recharges.

Life: Battery i guess is ok, you can only recharge it in its USB base though. For me, I took about 180 photos all with flash, LCD always on, and photo review time of 10 minutes total before the camera started dying on me. I already scratched my LCD screen though ;(  ...don't put this camera in same pocket as your keys.

My bad things about it: Honestly, the camera is too heavy for the shirt pocket, but it'll fit. U may need extra peripherals to make it better, like a car charger or separate AC charger, LCD screen protector coverings, carrying case, extra SD cards (camera has built in 10mb memory). The field of view is kinda narrow and zoom is not the best. It's a snapshot camera...for vacations, parties, picts for ebay )....etc...


I'm amazed how such a small camera can give u solid 4x6 photoquality prints, and reasonable video clips [just for illustrative purpose..don't shoot a movie with it ;)]

As I have seen, it's about $100 per megapixel. This is certainly a good deal. This camera is probably one of the best go anywhere cameras around. I recommend it. The biggest problem is the battery and how to charge it. If you solve that, you can take picts anywhere of whatever as much as you like so long as you have SD cards and battery life.

Hope this helps...I had to buy this on internet, Buydigs.com was fast and convenient by FedEx.
