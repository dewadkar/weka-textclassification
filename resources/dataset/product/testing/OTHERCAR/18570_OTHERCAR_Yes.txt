            I purchased this camera because it seemed to offer the best value of anything on the market.  It was going on Ubid for
around $360, and seemed to offer virtually every feature you could imagine using including 8 power zoom, programmed scene settings, good low light capability, USB connectivity etc.. The only drawback I could see was that it only had 1.3 megapixels, and current models have three times that many.  After receiving the camera, I found that it was very easy to set up, and within less then an hour I was taking pictures and transferring them to my computer.  In addition, the quality of the pictures was very nice looking - for web purposes at least.  

There are only two problems, I can see with this camera. One of the problems is, in my opinion, a fatal flaw, and as a result, I cannot recommend it.  The first problem, is the LCD screen.  It is very hard to see your subject, even indoors.  Outdoors you can forget it.  The camera offers no backup eyepiece viewfinder, so in many cases, you are taking pictures without being able to frame your subject. This is totally unacceptable !  The second problem, and this is not fatal, is the camera is kind of bulky to carry around. This camera is bigger then your typical point and shoot, and the size is a little odd, so it will not fit naturally into a camera bag.  I want something I can easily pull out of a small pouch or bag, take a picture, and then return to the bag without muss or fuss.  My replacement, the Nikon Coolpix 
880, is better in this regard.  The Coolpix does not offer the zoom capabilities of the Casio, nor is the software as user friendly;  However, if a zoom is what you are looking for, I would recommend you take a close look at the Olympus 2100Z.  It is more expensive then the Casio, but it offers an optical viewfinder, more megapixels, better ergonomics, and a better zoom lens.
