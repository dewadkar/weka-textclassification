            We bought our first Lincoln Town Car in 1987.  At that time, we bought a 1986.  We truly loved it.  We're not exactly sure what happened but assume it was an electrical fire that put it to rest in 1994.  This sad event put us in the market for another vehicle and not a lot of time to find one.  We needed it yesterday!  

We loved it so much we bought a 1990 Town Car.  It has been a great car for us.  We do almost all of our travelling in it and we are on the road approximately once a month, if not more.  When my in-laws went to Canada, they asked to take our car because it's comfortable, big and roomy.  The leg room is awesome, nothing compares.  My husband likes the fact that the seats recline almost all the way down.  

The trunk is huge! We have used this car to haul everything---everyone else uses a truck, we use our town car.

We were out with friends one night and she called it a &quot;townhouse&quot; instead of the town car.  We all got a good laugh out of that and have referred to it as that ever since.

The main problem we have is they ride so smooth, we don't realize how fast we are going and that gets us in trouble!  We already have a problem with lead feet so we don't need any help in that department!!

The only mechanical problem we've had with it seemed to be all in one year where we had to replace 3 or 4 spark plugs, one at a time.  Other than that, routine maintenance.

It's almost time to trade-in our current Town Car.  I'm going to miss it.  I'd love to get another but our problem is we need more room for transporting kids. When I look at the cost of vehicles, I'd prefer to have the Town Car.

This car gets about 22 mpg on the highway.

New these vehicles are pricey but used they aren't bad.
