               My mother bought this car when I was in about sixth grade, which would have been about 1998. She told me that she bought it at a used car dealership. I&#146m not sure exactly how much she bought it for, but she still pays $778 dollars a month to the dealership and she tells me every night that she can&#146t sell it for nearly as much as she owes on it. Make your own estimates on the price. 
	  I received my license on the 26th of November of 2003, which was about a week before this article was written. I have inherited the car as my mother has moved on to a Range Rover. I have to say that my Lexus has become my baby. Admittedly, it does have a lot of problems. The suspension is really messed up. I&#146ll be driving down the freeway at about 65 and the entire car will start to rock. It gets more and more violent until I give-in and merge into another lane, where it stops instantly. I don&#146t get it, but okay.
  	Also, somehow my alignment has become defunct. My steering wheel has to be turned about a forty-five degrees to the left  for the car to drive straight, which is slightly nerve racking taking the mountain road I take to get to school and to my best-friends house, but I&#146ve gotten used to it now. I don&#146t know if this alignment problem is due to the way the car was made, or something my mother did to it. I would guess the latter, but it&#146s better that those of you reading this review know it could potentially become a problem in the future.
	  The Lexus LX 450 has two seats in the very back, which can be folded up against the sides or taken out altogether. Last night I took them out and folded the back seats up so that they were out of the way, essentially hollowing out the back of the car. Then I put in a big chair pad and tossed some pillows in the back. My best friend, her boyfriend and I were eating lunch back there this afternoon and I reached over to open the tailgate so her boyfriend could get back it. I accidentally tugged it in the wrong direction and the handle broke off in my hand. Just broke off! That made me a little mad, because I&#146m not the Hulk or something.
	  The engine is very weak. It drives me crazy. On any sort of a hill I have to get about fifteen miles over the speed limit in order to make it up the hill at a reasonable rate. Even with that, I usually have about six cars behind me. I&#146ve resorted to verbally urging my car up the hill.
	  A few lesser problems that I&#146ve had with the car is that the paint on the hood is oxidizing. It looks&#133 interesting, to say the least. I bought some cream that&#146s supposed to stop the oxidation, so I&#146m not worried about having to get it repainted. The CD player recently jammed, too. As mileage goes, if you don&#146t have a good amount of money to spend on gas, this car is not for you. I pay about $40 for a full tank, and that gets me about 300 miles. It&#146s not horrible, but it&#146s not great, either. 
  	While all of the above is annoying, there is one major redeeming factor that makes my car my baby. I call it dependability, while others call it four-wheel drive. Let me tell you a little story. At my high-school we are required to do some community service. My best friend and I go out to a wild-life preserve and do some community service. Since I just got my license, I can&#146t drive her, but she&#146s had hers for about 10 months. We decided to take my car because it&#146s so scratched up and she has a brand-spanking new 2003 Toyota 4Runner. We go through mud and guck, so I volunteered my car. When we got to the preserve, my friend let me drive and she got in the back. We unhooked one of the back seats and tied it in with the various seatbelts. She sat back there while I drove around on the muddy, dusty roads. My car handled them beautifully. If it weren&#146t a Lexus, I would think that it was made to off-road. It handles better off-road than on a highway. I was flying around a dirt road at about 40 mphs, jumping through potholes and spinning my tires in puddles. We only skid once, when we were blasting back down the main road. I was going about fifty and I had to put my brakes on quickly because of a turn I hadn&#146t expected. We went into a skid for about ten feet, but all I had to do was take my foot off the accelerator and then push back down on it and we were off again.
	  In fact, we had so much fun in my car that we decided to go up to her house after school and mess around up there. She owns a lot of land on a mountain and has a massive field made for offroading. So I went out there after school (the drive takes about 40 minutes from school to home) and her sister comes running up to my car and bangs on the window. She jumps in an informs me, as I drive up there, that her sister (my best friend) has gotten her brand-new 4Runner stuck in the mud of the field (It had been raining for about five days previous to this). We waded out there and tried to get the car unstuck with a four-wheeler, which was a dumb thing to try. Then she suggested we try my car. I was hesitant. If her brand-new car couldn&#146t navigate the mud, why did she think my old clunky Lexus could? But I backed the car into the field. It took a lot of urging, because my car had a tough time backing through the mud. But I got it out there and we tied the chain to my bumper. She got in her car and I got in mine and the moment of truth was upon us as a slowly put my foot on the gas. First there was nothing, then I pressed down harder and my car gave a gigantic lurch forward, then stopped dead again as the chain tightened with the pressure. I pressed on the gas again&#133 and not only did my bumper NOT pop off, but I started moving again. We both started screaming in excitement as I towed her out of the mud. It was the coolest thing that has ever happened to me. I love my car endlessly and that dependability makes all it&#146s faults worthwhile.
	  Overall, I wouldn&#146t recommend this car to anyone but a teenager who loves going out and getting in trouble in the mud. Adults will find the car dangerous feeling and odd to get used to, while the younger generation will be delighted with it&#146s power on the back-roads of the world.
