            I just drove my Accent GS home a few hours ago.  When I went to the dealer's I didn't have high hopes.  I thought the Accents were too small and slow.  Then I test drove the GS to find that it was as quick as my 6 cylinder and roomier than expected.  I'm 6' 225 and I have no problems with the size of the car.  It has tremendous head room.  Even in the back seat.  The steering is very responsive.  I did have a little problem with blind spot but I think I just need to get used to using the mirrors differently.  Now my car only has 22 miles on it so there haven't been any problems yet, but even if there are that warranty is unreal.  I read different Accent reviews from the last two years and people said that the car needed more power.  I don't know if it's just because the GS steps up to a DOHC 105hp engine or because I'm realistic and know that it's not a sports car but this thing picks up and goes great.  No problem merging on the highway and since I live in Jersey that's essential.  Anyway, I recommend this for anyone who wants that awesome new car smell and is under a budget.  Aside from road performance I've found that the heat works great and the stereo (I have the tape deck) pumps out pretty good highs and lows.  It's a shame there's not more info on the dash but this is an economy car, I can only expect so much.  The trunk is huge, not to mention the 60/40 fold down seats.  Just be careful because the trunk locks and unlocks.  If you were to leave it unlocked anyone could pull the handle and get inside.  *UPDATE*   Ok, I' updating this a bit so as not to seem to anxious to say I loved it with only 22 miles on the car, I've now put a couple hundred miles on it and I still love it.  I haven't found anything that I strongly dislike about the car.  It's very easy and fun to drive.  The control is great and the ride is smooth.  Plus, everytime I see this car again I think it looks better.  It almost has some European stylings about it.  The curves, and somewhat bubble shaped roof.  I love the reverse lights, they remind me of another car I had considered, the Ford Focus.  There's just something cool about them.  The headlights too.  Hyundai did a very good job of sprucing this car up from the rather bland iterations that preceded it.  I guess that's why they sell so many.  Finally, one thing I love about this car is that I felt comfortable driving it right away.  Other cars I've had to get used to how to step on the gas or brake or how to steer but this car just feels right.  I don't know if that makes any sense but maybe you'll see what I mean.  Don't misunderstand me, I know this car isn't a Lexus but it's right for me.
