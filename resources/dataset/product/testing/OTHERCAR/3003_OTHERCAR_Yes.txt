            I bought this vehicle because I wanted a car that was comfortable, roomy and decent on gas mileage.

I love the way this car drives.  It has air shocks so you feel as if you are floating.  It is a very smooth ride and no other car that I have owned can compare.  The Lincoln Continental features lumbar seats which are great for me when my back hurts especially.  Climate control is such a great addition as well.  One outstanding feature, which is great for my husband and I, is the memory seat feature.  I set the memory for the way in which I like my seat positioned and he has his memory set for the way he likes his seat.  The only thing I have to do is push number 1 and the seat moves to the position I want it at.

I fell in love with the radio immediately.  It sounds like a $500 system even though it is a stock system.  The speakers are JBL Surround Sound and they sound great.  I enjoy having a tape deck but I would prefer a CD player any day.

Right now I am averaging 25 miles per gallon.  That is great compared to the gas mileage I used to get in my Mustang 5.0, which I still have but drive only when I am alone.  I basically take my kids everywhere and the Lincoln seems much more comfortable with them.

I would recommend this car to anyone who likes comfort and room.  It is great for a family and wonderful for long trips.  I will only buy Lincoln's from now on.<br><br>
