            My Mazda MPV is a roomy, practical vehicle that lets me blend in with my environs. In Hunter Green Metallic, it bears a strong resemblance to the Chrysler minivans of the same age, and doesn't draw attention to itself. 

We replaced a Hyundai Elantra with the MPV, and discovered that loading our toddler and her stuff doesn't have to be a backbreaking experience. With only three people in the van, I can fold down the third seat and have as much cargo space as a 1970's-style Brady Bunch station wagon. The MPV is much better looking, though.

Our MPV seems to be put together fairly well. Nothing rattles or falls off, and the ride is very smooth. My wife says there is little difference between driving the MPV and a regular car, and she likes being able to sit up high. The height is a definite advantage, since every other vehicle on the road is as large or larger than the MPV.

The sheetmetal on the outside seems to be very easy to dent. With so much sheetmetal on a van, there are a lot of places to get dings. Of course, if you're using the MPV as a family vehicle, you will find that people with kids do not have shiny, ding-free cars.

The 1995 MPV was the last to have the first-generation body style. 1996 and up will have a redesigned instrument panel and interior, as well as doors on each side of the van with roll-down windows. One minor flaw in our 1995 van is the single door that swings out instead of sliding open. Although driver-side doors were a rarity back in 1995, most minivans had (and still have) sliding doors. Our van's door swings VERY wide and is sometimes difficult to open in the garage or in a tight parking spot. I understand that the 2000 MPVs use standard sliding doors.

I am happy with my 1995 MPV, although I sometimes wish it had the 1996 body style. If you have the option, you might consider finding one a little newer if you are interested in the four doors and the improved interior. When I do switch cars, I will probably get the current-model MPV.
