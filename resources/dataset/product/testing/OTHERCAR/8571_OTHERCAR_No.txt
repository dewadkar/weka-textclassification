            We bought the Grand Am shortly after my son was born, because I had been driving a Probe and there was no room for a car seat in it.  We looked around to several lots, and I just wasn't happy with all the cars I was shown.  Then I saw the Grand Am.  It was sporty, yet big enough for the car seat (4-door) and good for long drives (NC-TX twice a year).  

We have had the car less than a year and have already put over 20,000 miles on it.  We have made 2 round trip drives to Tx (around 1200 each way) and also a trip up to Maine.  Plus the every day ins and outs of driving.  

When we first got the car it had a carbon buildup problem (which is common in Grand Am's that weren't driven long distances or at high speeds) one trip to Tx solved that problem very efficiantly.  

The other problems we have had is the gas guage seems to be very off.  It will stay at full for around 200 miles, then drop to 1/4 tank for the next 50 miles, drop to empty for around 25 miles and then go back up to 1/4 tank before it dies because it is out of gas.  I have learned that my car goes 320 miles on a tank in the city and therefore fill up at around 275 miles.  

Both problems I can live with because I love my car.  I like the power it has, and the saftey it offers.  It is comfortable, and easy to drive.  <br><br>
