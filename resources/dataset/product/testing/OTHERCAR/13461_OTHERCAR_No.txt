                 <b>C</b>ompared to the standard Integra, the Type R is a true 'go fast sports machine'. It had one of the most potent four cylinder engines available in 1998. The Acura Integra Type R offers race car handling and adequate-strong outright performance. Despite being an all around fun car, the Type R was obviously made more for the twistys than the drag strip. 


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>
     
  <b>T</b>he 1.8 liter DOHC V-tec Engine is the proverbial 'nerve' of the Acura Integra Type R. Everything else seems almost irrelevant, including the stark interior. When you press on along your favorite stretch of road, in my case old highway US 101 through the Avenue Of The Giants in Northern California, you feel this car has no limits to how fast it can take a turn. No other 4-cylinder powered car this side of the racing circuit sounds as aggressive as the Acura Type R. This little 1.8 liter DOHC engine shoots the Integra forward at a decent pace, but again this is no drag car. One can think of it as the Wonder Bra for the otherwise blase base Integra. The <b>brakes</b> are the most delicate and responsive of any car I have driven in its class for that year(1998). The Steering is light and precise and the <b>handling</b> is composed and sharp. 
            
<b>The V-TEC engine</b> is basically the same engine used in the Accord and Civic VTI back in Japan, but with a number of enhancements. It has low friction pistons, high volume air intake, a larger bore intake manifold, lightweight intake valves, high lift camshafts, double valve springs, slimmer valve stems,a bigger free flow exhaust (no dual exhaust) and a balanced, high precision crankshaft. If the specs I read are correct, it has a very high 11:1:1 compression ratio. The maximum power output in this car occurs at an amazing 8,000 RPM. The Integra Type R gets around 30 MPG on the highway according to the EPA.
      
 <b>T</b>he Integra Type R is based on a front engine, front wheel drive layout with independent <b>suspension</b> by double wishbones all around. However modifications take the Type R onto a different plane. The suspension is lowered and has stiffer springs, firmer shocks and bushings, and thicker anti roll bars. A Helical limited slip differential helps to prevent wheel spin. Sorry guys, but this car is not a tire smoker.

<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>  
    
The <b>exterior</b> is kinda plain, we see many of these Type Rs all dressed up, but stock they come pretty darn plain, almost looking like a regular GSR, or GS. Buyer beware, many Type Rs you see on the road are not actual Type Rs. They are dressed up Gs's and other lesser models, so if you are in the market for a real one, make sure it's genuine.

<i>Interior Accommodation:</i> 
        
<b>D</b>espite the Integra type Rs amazing fun factor in performance, the <b>interior</b> like the exterior, to say the most is "plain." Supportive seats are nice feature, but the interior is kinda cramped, and the dash board looks cheap. Ergonomics are very good, but amenities are far and
few between. It seems Acura really wanted to keep the weight down, and by doing so sacrificed many luxuries. Personally I would take a sunroof over a 0.1 sec 1/4th time gain.

<i>Reliable?</i> 

Yes, the Honda built 1.8 liter engine in the Acura Integra supercedes the reliability of many other sports cars in this class. This engine also has the capability of being modified and still being a reliability champ. 

<i>Pricing:</i>               

    The <b>price</b> for these cars are still super high, if you find a used 1998 type R for under 18K you are lucky.  Brand new these cars ran for as much as $26,000, sometimes even more.
