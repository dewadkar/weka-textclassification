            Reading the other opinions, I'm a bit confused with all the comments about the Echo being ugly.  The first time one got my attention was seeing it in front of me in traffic - &quot;What in the flying Farkle is that?&quot;  It had something of that VW Bug (old model)cuteness.  It's a cute car.  It's not a vision of loveliness; it's not Rad/Cool/Groovey/stylish or any of those other things people say when they want to be seen as liking what the &quot;IN&quot; crowd likes.  It's just cute; as the Dickens.

We bought one, primarily, for the wifes daily commute to work, which is about 30 miles on paved road.  We considered the Civic, Corolla, and New Bug. 

After about 1 1/2 months of running the little Red Raver, these are my observations on our 2 door with manual tranny: 

PRO:

1. Doesn't cost a lot to get into one.  Ours was on sale for $11,000.

2. Has all the advantages of a itty bitty car - zips around in parking lots like dream, parks in virtually no space at all, REAL (and I do mean REAL) good gas mileage, comparatively cheap upkeep (batteries, tires, et al).

3. Astounding Head Room - I'm 6' tall and there's more headroom than I need - in this tiny little toy!

4. Passenger room: On one occasion we needed to take myself, my wife, my football player sized, 17 year old Step son, his slightly smaller friend, and their BIG 17 year old buddy and a large duffle bag across town.  I seriously doubted we could even get close to getting everybody in.  It was positively comfortable for everybody!  This includes those kids in back.  There was plenty of room in the trunk for more gear.  Wow.

5. Trunk space....Champion.

6. Surprisingly peppy exceleration.  This rig is much more powerful than one would think.

7. It's a Toyota - which suggests that it may hold together for a while.

8. Didn't have to buy power windows.  Hate those.

9. Dials &amp; idiot lights are CENTER mounted.  It's strange.  Takes a little getting used to, but it works in a toy sized outfit like this.

Con:

1. Had to buy Air conditioning.  Hate that.

2. Road noise.  If you need a quiet ride, don't even consider the Echo.  This thing generates more road noise on perfectly smooth pavement than I've ever encountered in any rig, anywhere , at any time.  Doesn't bother me a bit,though, - for how we drive it, but if you drive lots of chuck holed, wash board, gravel roads .....get a Pick up or SUV.

3. Don't think I really want to get into a knock down/drag out wreck in one of these things either.  Of course, that's true of any tiny car. If the crash itself doesn't get you - the government mandated air bag will.  Again, if safety is a priority, get a Used Pick-up or SUV made before the politicians forced the auto makers to mount the kid killers in the dash.

I'd have to rate the Echo (mindful of the drawbacks common to all small cars) with 4 1/2 to 5 stars.  Wish I was able to get one of these silly things for myself, instead of having to drive the wifes, when she lets me.  <br><br>
