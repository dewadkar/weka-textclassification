            i got this vehicle because i wanted to buy a vehicle that was in good condition and also it was my work truck and i depended on it while i was out on the job and out on site. i then heard that the business was going out of business and then i heard that they were selling the vehicle and i told them that i wanted to buy that truck.....and then i got it and now i have it..i love this truck b/c it takes me places that i cant go in a car and it also gets good gas mileage and it is Really Tough. the ride is a little rough but the suspention ont the truck is GREAT and it never slips....and i have only gotten it stuck and that reason was because of very fine sand and i had another truck pull me out in 3 min after i was stuck. changing the oil is really great and the filter is right there and you dont burn your hands while you change it and there is alot of space under the hood to put a biger engine if you wanted to...and it really is fun to ride around in.and i like that everything is push button.<br><br>
