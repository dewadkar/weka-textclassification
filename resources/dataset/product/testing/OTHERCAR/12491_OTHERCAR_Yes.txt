            Excellent. Body design is excellent and I have never seen a ding or a dent in this car's body. The interior is very roomy in the front seating. However, the back seat is made only for small children. This has not been a problem since I alone drive the car and sometimes just one front passenger. This car is perfect for one or two adults. I think it was mean for adults. It is the best choice for a family car is your kids are over the age of ten. One thing to note though is that this car is very conmfortable on trips and also around town. Inside the ride is comfortable and very quiet. This 4 cylinder rides like an 8 to me with lots of pep, yet it is hard to hear the road noise in town or on a trip. A very enjoyable car to own.
