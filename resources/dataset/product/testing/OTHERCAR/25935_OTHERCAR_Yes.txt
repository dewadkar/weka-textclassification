              I decided I really needed to get a small car to drive to and from work every-day.  I drive 45 minutes to work.  And more times than not I am stuck in the grind of Charlotte traffic.  Traffic snarls are a part of the grit and grind of this mess.
  I was driving our family vehicle which is a Ford Windstar.  This is a wonderful family van but for the day to day traffic its not really the way to go.  
  I checked around and looked into a few cars that I thought I would like.  And after the recommendations of a few friends and family members I decided to look for 2 certain types.  I looked for a Pontiac Grand Am and a Dodge Avenger.  
  OK, now that the decision is made to 2 cars now comes the insurance rates for each of the 2.  I called my insurance agent and discussed the in and outs of the rates of these two cars with her.  They compared very close in rates except for the avenger is slightly higher cause it can be considered a sports car.  Not many of us would think of it that way but according to the insurance it is.  So I went with the Grand Am.
  Now, 2 door or 4?  5 speed or automatic?  I wanted to get something that gave me the feeling of sporty but the gas mileage had to be good in the traffic.  I saw several that I liked and I drove the automatic but wasn't happy with the get up and go.  I drove the 5 speed and it had the uuummmppp I was looking for.  I fell in love with this car.  Came equiped with a 6 cd exchanger.  Well, not that it made the sell.  It didn't hurt at all.  I like to listen to my music on the way to and from work while just sitting in the traffic.
  I have had my grand am now for 2 months and I have to admit that I love it.  Its just right for me while driving to work.  Its dependable, gets good gas mileage, the kids (all 3 of them) fit comfortably in the back seat.  And yes 2 of them are in toddler boosters, and the other is 10 years old.  So the car is perfect for the family and the single person.
  Its easy to work on when you have to have something done to it.  My husband was looking it over before I bought it and he found that the spark plugs are simple to change and the all sorts of simple things for the mechanical minded person.  This is a mechanic friendly car.
  These cars are priced in a range that most of us can afford.  From $19,000.00 on up.
