            I have driven My 1999 Chevy Blazer 4 door for about 9 months. I bought the car with 8K miles and have since put on 12K.  It has a very strong engine, and the ride is very smooth.  In the 9 months I have had it, I have done no repair work to it at all. the only thing i have had done was get the oil changed 3 times. It has a fairly large amount of cargo space as well. I have the factory sound system that comes with a CD player and a tape player, and it sounds very nice. The vehicle has daytime running lights and the lights automatically turn on when it is dark out. The only thing I don't like about the car is that It does not have a lot of headroom for the people inside, though this doesn't really bother me, because I am otherwise happy with the Car!
