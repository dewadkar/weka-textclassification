            This car looks great, but in reality, it's not very fast, and a true pain in the b*** to drive around town.  This is my opinion of the Countach after owning it for several years.  

My Countach was a red 1983 (non quattro valvole) model with black leather interior.  I bought the car several years ago with approximately 4,000 miles on it.  At first I was excited.  The car was in amazing shape.   I drove the car everywhere.  I got a lot of looks from passers-by and others always wanted to race.  It was fine in the beginning, but it got old pretty quickly.  I also realized that I could not park this car anywhere except for my garage.  I could not get over curbs at parking entrances, and could not park on a street due to fear of random vandalizing. 

Then summer came along with 90-degree weather.  This car's front windshield comes way back in the cockpit, and the whole car turns into a greenhouse.  Also, you're back against a V12, and hugging a transmission under your armpit.  My car had air conditioning, but only the blower was way too weak.  This is not a summer car at all.  I was sweating bullets while driving this car.  

Then there's the problem of outward vision.  I had the optional big wing on the rear of the car, and due to that, you cannot see who's behind you (even if it was a police car, not that I broke the speed limit in the car:)). (I guess I should feel lucky as the 4-valve car has down draft carbs that stick up from the engine that blocks total view out the back window, whereas my car had the side drafts that's flat along the hood)  Also, when I wanted to back up into a parking space, I could not see out the back.  I had to sit on the door sill with the door open and look out the door while I negotiated with non-power assisted steering and super heave clutch and gas pedal.   I guess this car was designed to go straightforward quickly.

One day, I drove my friend's 25th anniversary model (4-valve model) with approximately with 80 more horsepower.  Now that car rocks.  It is much faster than my car, and it actually has an A/C that works.  Compared to the 4-valve model, the two valver feels like a rowboat.  From that day on I did not drive my car very much, and after a year, ended up selling my car.  

There are two consolations to this story.   One is that I was able to sell it for a little bit more than I paid for it after four years of ownership.  The second is that the car was pretty robust, with the waterpump the only thing going wrong during my ownership.  Would you like to know my recommendation?  If you want something different, get a Countach just so that you can say you had one, but I will recommend a Ferrari TR or a BB over a Countach any day.
