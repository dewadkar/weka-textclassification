            The DC20 is extremely easy to use. In fact, it's so simple you don't have much control. There's no focus and no flash (although a flash attachment is in the works). And the digital-control center found on higher-end Kodak cameras has been replaced on the DC20 with three colored lights that flash status messages.
The DC20 holds up to 16 standard-resolution (320-by-240-pixel) images, or up to 8 higher-resolution (493-by-373-pixel) images in its internal storage. You download images to your PC to develop them.

The DC20's software is excellent. The bundle includes Kai's Power Goo from MetaTools, which lets you morph images with ease, and Kodak's Picture Postcard software, which allows you to send images via e-mail.

The DC20 is as point-and-click as you can get. If you need basic snapshots at a decent price, picking the DC20 should be a snap.
