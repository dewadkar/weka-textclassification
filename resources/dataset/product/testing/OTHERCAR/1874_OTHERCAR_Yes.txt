            I drive a two-door maroon 1992 Grand Am, and unashamedly I say that <b>I love this car</b>.  It was love at first sight and I have an affection for my car that continues to this day.

We bought the car new in 1992. Even though I was all of nine years old and nowhere near driving age, when the salesman drove this car out, I started jumping up and down and yelling to my parents, "Buy the pretty little red car!  Oh, buy the pretty little red car!"

They did.  Since then, the pretty little red car has weathered two long-distance road trips, two collisions, and moving to college and back.  There's 76,000 miles on the odometer, and I think the car would happily put another 76,000 on.

Admittedly, my enthusiasm for the car at nine years of age mainly had to do with its looks.  Even at ten years old, this car is still a looker.  All swoopy curves and smooth lines, the catlike "face" of this car catches the eye and won't let go.  Other reviewers write of having had paint problems; aside from the clearcoat wearing off, my Grand Am is still clad in the same maroon paint it left the factory with.

As far as the interior goes, I haven't driven a car yet that could match this Grand Am for convenience of design.  All the controls one could need are right there at one's fingertips.  The two stalks, while bumpy and odd-looking, host a wealth of controls, and the climate control system is easy to manipulate without having to look away from the road.  The seats are low-slung and comfortable, reclined just right.

Of course, it's not all sunshine and roses with this car.  I can't figure out exactly what height Pontiac designed this car for.  With its low roof, anyone who's over about 5'9" brushes the ceiling, but the front seat doesn't move up quite far enough to accomodate my 5'3" frame.  It's a bit of a stretch to reach the pedals.

An endemic problem to this year of Grand Ams is the electrical system.  If there's one thing that every Grand Am owner has had repaired, it's the electrical system.  While mine hasn't suffered the extreme problems that some others have (I know of two people whose electrical systems caught fire and burned the car out), I've had to replace the alternator three times, the last time as recently as last summer.

Aside from that, this car hasn't had many mechanical problems that I haven't incurred by running it into things.  We've had to replace some of the "idiot lights" because the sensors had burned out, and about four months ago the solenoid in the automatic transmission went out.  The car is currently in the shop now with a blown head gasket.

Performance-wise, I'm happy with this car.  For a four-cylinder car, it's got a lot of get up and go.  Braking is a little soft and will take some getting used to when switching cars.  And of course, there's that matter of the rattle in the dash . . .

All told, I wouldn't trade in my beloved car for anything -- except maybe a silver New Beetle . . .
