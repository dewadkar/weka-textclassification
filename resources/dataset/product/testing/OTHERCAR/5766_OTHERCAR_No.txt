            The GC-QX3 from JVC is a relatively low cost, high performance digital still camera.  It has a base resolution of 3.3 mega-pixels with the ability of doing a 6.0 mega-pixel image.  It is easy to use.  I figured the basic functions out in less than 10 minutes without reading the manual.

It has a decent little 2.3x zoom.  And it has an outstanding macro feature.  It focuses to about an inch.  I have done some spectacular highly detailed close up images on this camera.

It also has a 20 second movie function.  But I haven't used it much.

It uses Smartmedia.  Which I consider an advantage since Smartmedia is nearly indestructible.  Mine went through the washing machine and came out images intact.  Try that with compact flash!

The boxed camera comes with an AC adapter, a rechargeable high capacity lithium battery, a USB cable, and video out cable.  It doesn't use those antiquated AA batteries that other manufactures favor.

The one draw back is that it only comes with an 8MB card.  That is not a big drawback though.  it certainly didn't deter me.

Addendum a long time after:

Okay, the picture quality is still good:  But the battery life is awful.  As for what I said about it focusing to about an inch, actually it will focus as close as you can get it to the subject without blocking the light.
