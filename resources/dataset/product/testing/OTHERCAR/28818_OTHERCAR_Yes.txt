            &quot;Performance meets point-and-shoot.The DC210 Plus is the most advanced, most affordable and easiest-to-use digital camera in its class. It delivers spectacular detail, color, and sharpness thanks to megapixel technology and a 2X wide-angle zoom lens.&quot;

I have found a reconditioned Kodac DC210 Plus digital camera by visiting the Kodak website, and after trying it out( it's our second one..by choice) we made a wise choice, and saved a bundle. We purchased the SanDisk card reader for under $79 and saved hours of upload time on the computer. The only gripe we have is this: the DC210 Plus does NOT have a lens cover like the newer models, and I had to fashion one myself. After spending almost $400 on a reconditioned digital camera, and accessories, you would think they would have included a lens cover with this model at the time of introduction, an oversight on Kodak's part.The telephoto lens has been redesigned to accomidate a lens cover in the newer models. Other than that minor iritant, we are very pleased with this product and would recommend buying reconditioned to anyone. We have had excellent service from Kodak, with respect to repairs and replacements. I  have found that they are more willing to replace a defective product with a new one, over repairing your old camera.
I love the LCD viewfinder ability on this one, although it is highly recommended you use rechargable batteries if using this feature often. It does suck down the battery life quickly.

Two thumbs up for reconditioned product.This one may be hard to find now, with newer cameras coming out every day, but consider reconditioned. Save a few bucks, and get upgrades periodically from the Kodak website!
