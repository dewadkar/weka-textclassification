            This is one heck of a car.  Everyone is familiar with the shape of the car, but get inside and check out the cool inside.  

I have the turbo model and VW did not leave out any feature.  It has power sunroof, all wheel drive anti-lock breaks, side-impact air bags for driver and passenger (in addition to regular air bags), heated seats, heated mirrors, cruise control, six cd changer, flower holder, key less entry, alarm, 2 year total coverage (even check-ups) warranty and so forth.

It is very fun to drive.  The turbo is very quick and it is small enough to zip around the city.  However, it is bigger than you might think - a tall person would have plenty of headroom in this car.

The few negatives - the cup holders are ackwardly placed, and the "check engine" light (which sounds really bad, but really is not (unless it starts blinking)) in mine has come on several times and was fixed by the dealer without charge.

If you ever wanted a bug, this is the one to buy.  I'd love to have one from the sixties, but this new one has really spoiled me, I'm afraid.
