            As of July 2001, Toyota dealers are ready to deal. I got $3,100 off the $33,709 sticker (paid $30,598 with side airbags, 3-in-1 6-disc combo, leather, limited and tow prep packages, vehicle skid control, center console, cargo liner, carpet mats and trunk mat, color-keyed fender flares, moonroof).

The Highlander is a perfect combo of my last two cars, both Acuras: comfort/size of the 2.5TL sedan and utility of the Integra hatchback (yet much more cargo space). I just traveled 660-mile roundtrip in the Highlander and overall it was a dream to drive. I also averaged 24 mpg on the rolling hills highway using cruise control at 70-75 mph, auto climate control at 77 degrees, and with a fairly full cargo load.  However, the long trip did point out some shortcomings. If you wear sunglasses, it�s virtually impossible to see the recessed display panel during the day, especially the tiny cruise control �on� light. The cruise control handle on the steering wheel rests just below the windshield wiper handle on the steering column. Several times I hit the wipers instead of the �decrease cruise control speed� button and that confusion could have put me in some potentially dangerous driving situations. And if you tinker and try to read the small LED temperature/mpg gauge located above the audio/air system while the SUV is in motion, you are liable to run off the road. Finally, when buckling my driver side seat belt, I  have to yank the buckle from behind the space between my chair and the side column of the car, then lift my right captain�s chair armrest to buckle in.  I am also experiencing an occasional �popping� noise that takes turns on the audio speakers (even with the volume turned down).

These are things to look out for rather than deter you from purchasing a SUV that feels solid, has been for the most part well thought out in amenities and cargo/passenger space, handles great, has pick up to spare and good highway mpg, and is a fairly comfortable ride. And now that you can actually get one loaded for around $30.5k, it�s a deal.  If your worst driving conditions are rain and light snow, Consumer Reports states that 2WD with traction control is sufficient. Plus you get a price break, better gas mileage and less parts to break.  Also, I compared insurance of a Highlander 2WD vs. 4WD and the 2WD was $425 less to insure annually.

When comparing to the other cars I test drove, the Acura MDX was terrific but out of my price range, too much SUV for my needs, some bad side rear sight lines, and the exterior style is blah.  The Subaru Outback didn�t give me the �wow� feeling when I drove it, the interior was tight, and the pickup dragged for a V6 3.0. And it�s still a station wagon despite the bells and whistles.

And for those who think the look of the Highlander is a bit too cuddly, I recommend replacing the mud flaps with optional color-keyed fender flares and a bug/rock deflector on the front. It �butches� it up considerably!
