            The first part of this review will address the performance of this great car and the most mentioned negative which is &#147not enough horsepower.&#148  Lets address the horsepower first as this is what made me a little skeptical about wanting to purchase this car after reading a lot of consumer reviews.  I feel that the prot�g� has all the horsepower and torque the average person will need.  I want to keep this in perspective so I am not talking about a sports car here.  If you want to win drag races from lights or take on muscle cars you will not be very successful with the Pro5.  It is not going to keep up with a sports car.  It will however hold its own with any normal car on the market such as an Accord or Camry. (I am talking about the models with the base engine.) I did buy a manual 5-speed model so I cannot really comment on the Automatic version.  My Pro5 is still brand new so I have not even revved it hard yet as I am still breaking in the motor and I do not want for any more power at all.  It accelerates well from a stop and the car does feel peppy.  I was a little concerned that the car would not have enough power on the highway after reading some reviews but it does fine, and I have not had to down shift to pass anyone.  It zips alone at 80 miles per hour without any trouble at all.  The engine does get a little buzy at 80mph but it is a 4 cylinder and that is to be expected. Further, the cruise control works real well also.  So please if you are looking for a real fast sports car, look elsewhere; however, everyone else should not be turned away by comments that the car needs more horsepower.

The steering is very accurate and the car feels like it is on rails.  It takes corners real well and it does handle as well as any sports car I have driven.  It is a real fun car to drive with the 5-speed.  The brakes are also top notch.  The 4 wheel disc brakes provide plenty of stopping power.  I have read in a few reviews that the car does bounce a little bit over bumps.  It does have a moderately stiff suspension but that is what gives the car its great handling and its sports car feel.  I have certainly been in cars with stiffer suspensions, so I would not call this a negative.  To summarize the performance of this car is top notch compared to any other car in its class including the Civic and Matrix.  I test-drove them both. As you can tell, I love driving this vehicle.

With most options you want standard (except leather seats, 6 disc changer and moon roof) the car has all the creature comforts you need.  I couple of reviews I read indicated the stereo was not that good and that the cup holders are not large enough to hold full size beverages.  In 2003 they enlarged the cup holders and added a standard sub-woofer build into the floor of the car.  The cup holders work fine for all types of beverages and they are out of the way so they don&#146t block the shifter or any of the other controls of the car.  The sub-woofer gives the stereo a lot of punch and I think it sounds excellent.  I realize this is subjective, but in all the cars I have owned this stock system sounds the best to me.  I usually swap out my stock system for an after market which gives me a little more punch, I will not need to do this with this car.  Finally, the seats are so comfortable.  The overall comfort and look of the interior sets this car apart from others in it&#146s class.  

In conclusion, Mazda has put together quite a car for the money.  Some say that the car needs more horsepower.  Hey we all want more horsepower it kind of like we all want more money too, but believe me this car has plenty for everyday driving.  It also handles like a sports car and is a lot of fun on a winding back road.  I bought this car brand new with only 31 miles on it for $15,300.  There are no other cars out there in that price range, which offer as much.  Do yourself a favor; take one for a test drive, you won&#146t be sorry.

One last thing my car is so new a can not possibly talk about reliability at this point.  I will try to update this review once a have some real miles on the car.
