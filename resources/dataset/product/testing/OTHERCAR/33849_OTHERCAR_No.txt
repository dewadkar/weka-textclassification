            Buick can't fix the AM radio. 

I recently purchased a '98 Park Avenue with 25,000 miles on the odometer. 
I wanted the Park Avenue for its room and ride. I drive 35,000 miles a year, much of it personal long distance trips.  

I have the standard V-6 engine. The comfort and handling of the vehicle has met my expectations. I've also been very pleased with the gas mileage.  I get 25 - 27 mpg normally and even got 30 mpg on a 400 mile trip with a tail wind. 

Unfortunately, my enjoyment of the vehicle has been marred with the inability of Buick to correct an engine noise that occurs at low RPM's on AM radio stations.  The local dealer has twice replaced the alternator, replaced the antenna cable, pulled the radio and had it tested, but the &quot;buzz&quot; remains.  

Today I spoke to the Buick customer service &quot;800&quot; line, they told me there is nothing else they can do and if I am dissatisfied I will need to write to the Better Business Bureau. Now I am not only dissatisfied, I am angry! Is this Buick's policy? If we can't fix it, call the BBB. On a $30,000 vehicle and the radio doesn't work.  Needless to say after wishing to get into a Park Avenue for some years, It will most likely be my last PA!<br><br>
