            I was in the market for a digital camera and wanted to make sure I got something that was reasonably priced, excellent quality and easy to use.  After much searching online and at stores, I came across the Olympus Brio D-230 at a large online retailer.  I thought for 2 megapixels at 199.99 is a good deal that should be taken advantage of while it lasted.  When I got it, it came with 2 alkaline batteries, a USB cord, and camera strap and software.  The alkaline batteries for the digital camera were a joke; they only lasted about 20 minutes with use of the monitor.  I decided NiMH rechargeables were the way to go and saves money in the long run.  The software included is okay, meaning there is not much of an editing feature with it to help adjust and touch up shots.  It just serves pretty much as an organizational program to file your pictures with and a few features like sepia and emboss as well for an extra touch.  
   
   Regarding the camera itself, I was impressed how solid it was built, yet could be so light in weight.  It only takes two batteries, which is a bonus with rechargebles as you can have on set charge while shooting with the other.  When you slide the lens cover open, the camera is ready to be used right away, with the included 16 MB memory card to shoot enough high quality pictures to equal a roll of film, or about 70 pictures on it's lowest setting (I decided to get the 64 MB card, which holds about 325 lowest quality shots).  You can select to take pictures using the monitor, which eats up the battery or use the viewfinder with setting the option to then display the picture after it's taken on the 1.5" LCD screen (which I prefer).  With the monitor, you can then select on the back to display the menu, which is user friendly to move around to set the numerous features.

   On the first part of the menu, you can set the light balance, the flash setting (of 6 selections including a nighttime flash setting with red eye reduction), the focus setting (macro, close-up or automatic), spot metering and functions (which includes merging 2 pictures into one, which really serves little purpose to myself).  On the back of the camera, there are two shortcut buttons to change from auto-focus to close up and to query through the flash types (auto, flash, no flash, red eye, nighttime and nighttime red eye) without going through the menus', which is a nice feature.  The drive feature is also located in this menu.  From here, you can choose to set the camera to shoot single pictures, shoot a fast sequence of 15 shots in a row, a self timer (that flashes a red light to show picture is being taken) or a movie mode, which records up to a minute (with 16 MB card included) of standard quality of 160 x 120.  The movies turn out cool (no sound however) and add to the cool features this camera offers at just under $200 dollars.

On the second menu scrolling down, you can set the white balance depending on what type of light you are shooting in, the quality of the shots ranging from 1600x1208, 1600x1200, 1024x768, 640x480.  The standard card can shoot about 10 of the highest quality shots and quite a few of the lowest quality (around 70 or so).  On the last menu, you can delete certain pictures, set the time and noise level on or off of the beep and whether or not to display the image on the monitor when not using the monitor to capture a image and a reset option as well.

When closing the camera lens, you can hit the monitor button located on the back to show off the pictures.  You can hit the down button which shows an index of all the pictures taken and you can run through a slide show of them all and even see the movie clips (though they can take a while to upload to view).  You can also rotate images from the menu buttons, delete images and add features of sepia and black and white, as well as send the image to the printer.

Hooking up the camera to the USB was easy, and I mean easy.  Just plug into the camera the cable, and then into the computer (works on both Mac and Compaq with XP) and your computer reads it as a removable drive to take images from.  That's it...no need to install drivers or anything of the sort.  You can then incorporate the images in the software included to make red eye adjustments or to sharpen or emboss images as well.  

The one problem you will find with most cameras at this price is that they don't have optical zoom, which is standard on most film cameras these days at this price.  It has digital zoom that you can adjust on the camera, but that just decreases the pixels in the image to "zoom in," but all it does is decrease image quality.  For a point and shoot person, this is a fine camera to buy.  For someone looking for anything more out of a camera, I would suggest something a bit more pricey with a decent optical zoom.  However, the camera does get the job done quite well and the image quality of the pictures (especially at SHQ) is quite amazing and not grainy at all like most camera's images within this price range.  I recommend a carrying case for it, which runs only about 10 dollars for a decent one that you can trust with your camera.  It's a good buy for anyone wanting to take the leap from film to digital.  You will not be disappointed at the quality that Olympus puts into this Brio D-230.
