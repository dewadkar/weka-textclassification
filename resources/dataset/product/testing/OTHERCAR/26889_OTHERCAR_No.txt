                 My Family has been driving Caravan/Voyagers for about 10 years. Having four kids changes a mini-van from a luxury to a necessity. The first was an '86. It didn't seem to matter how badly my wife abused it(she's very hard on cars), it just kept going. The next was a '91. Unfortunately, quality design seems to have been lost as Dodge moved into the '90's.

     Shortly after the warranty ended, the '91 began having electrical, transmission and drive axle problems. This van came equipped with a 3.3 liter V-6, overdrive transmission, and all the electrical goodies that make our lives more convenient (when they work). The electrical problems came first. Interior lights, power windows, electric locks, and the speedometer all worked intermittently. Now I've been a master auto mechanic for 20 years, and I've always enjoyed doing electrical work, but after awhile these continuing problems got a little redundant.

     Dodge has also had continuing transmission and drive axle problems throughout the '90's. After the second tranny went, I sent it to Dodge for a brand new transmission (as opposed to a rebuilt one). This tranny lasted all of 47k miles before dying again. Chrysler told me I was on my own (what a surprise) and to spend another $1700 to fix it(as if I had a money tree in the back yard). In all my years repairing cars I've never seen a tranny as poor as this one. 

     Upon looking into the cause of these continuing tranny problems, I discovered that Chrysler uses inferior quality snap-rings in the clutch pacs inside the transmission. To date this problem still goes uncorrected.

     While visiting a friend's transmission shop looking for answers (I just couldn't accept spending $1700 every 40 to 50k miles), I was surprised to see two '96's and one 97 in for the same problem. All of these vehicles had less than 70k miles run up on the odometer. Furthermore, I was told that many tranny shops will no longer use Chrysler manufactured parts to overhaul these transmissions. This certainly speaks to the level of quality (or lack there of) of Chrysler products.

     At one time, the Caravan/Voyager was considered the premier mini-van. However, as time and Lee Iococa have moved on, the idea of building a long-lasting product seems to have given way to a focus on planned obsolescence. A second call placed to Chryslers consumer affairs division confirmed this observation when I was informed that Chrysler doesn't believe there is a problem because most of their transmissions out last the warranty provided. The warranty on a new vehicle is 3 years or 36k miles. Upon replacing major drive-train components, the warranty on the new parts fall to 1 year or 12k miles. Even bearing in mind that as a professional mechanic I get my parts at wholesale cost and do my own work, these continuing problems translate to large repair bills and amounts of time spent to maintain this vehicle (aka hunk of junk). 

     I definitely would not recommend buying one of these mini-vans unless you enjoy spending a great deal of money and time in the repair shop. If you buy one anyway or already have one, give me a call. My own shop can always use the business.  <br><br>
