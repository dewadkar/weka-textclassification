            My experience with the 2000 model RS has been so far excellente.  Impreza is so interesting because it uses AWD, while the next mid-size/sub compact car with 4 wheel drive costs about twice as much.  The new hood is tres cool. Even though the hood scoop is non-functional, who cares.  I consider this car the most stylish sub-compact car of 2000.  Good fuel economy, tight turning, great lighting, and an unmatched saftey record make the Impreza a definite sell.  The only con is cramped trunk space and back seat.  After driving the interstate for four hours, i hear no untoward engine rattles or vibrations.  Factory paint job stands up well to normal highway gravel and debris. <br><br>
