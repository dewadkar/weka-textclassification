            My 1992 Mercury Sable was purchased in the spring of 1993, from a dealer; it was his car, so I knew it had been taken good care of in it's first 7000 miles.  In the past seven years, I have had the air compressor go (first summer, while still under warranty); I have had a couple minor things repaired over the years and last summer, just after 90,000 miles, it blew a head gasket.  I found out the reason for that was the 3.8 liter engine - turns out they are notorious for it.  Otherwise, this has been a great vehicle!  Last week, it turned over 100,000 miles, and is still doing good.  The body is in great shape, even with the salted Wisconsin roads.  I would recommend this car to anyone!<br><br>
