            As the science department chair, I needed a cross platform digital camera with the max number of pixel saturation for all science courses.  The 260 proved to be one of the best for the price we could afford.  We have Mac's and PCs in the department.  We have Physics to Environmental Science with a broad range of pictures, from close up to telescopic.  The 260 proved to be the camera needed for science classes, with very clear pictures, especially when printed on glossy paper, even on the HP DeskJet, much less a laser printer.<br><br>
