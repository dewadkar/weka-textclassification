            We recently rented a Chevrolet Impala to use on our vacation.  We have been thinking about purchasing one and thought we would try it out while we were traveling to see if it was really the car for us.

This is a very good looking vehicle--both inside and out and you have a lot of colors to choose from.  The LS model has a few options (or standard) items that the &quot;non-LS&quot; model does not but overall the car and it's performance is the same.

My husband and I both liked how the car handled.  The ride was really smooth and quiet.  We also got excellent gas mileage. We averaged around 27-28 miles per gallon on our trip (this includes both highway and city miles).  With gas prices the way they are right now, this was great in our eyes.

 Our trip took us a total of over 2000 miles through all kinds of country.  The majority of our driving, however, was in mountainous terrain.  We were impressed with the Impala's power.  We never had a moments trouble with even the steepest of inclines.

The Impala is plenty roomy also.  Our kids rode in the back and had more than enough room for themselves and all of their travel paraphanalia!!   The trunk space was incredible as well.  We had 5 suitcases, hanging bag, cooler and snack bag with room to spare.  Which was good because on the way home we had more stuff to pack in there!!!

 The kids liked the fact that they could access the trunk from the back seat.  This made it really handy when they wanted a snack or drink from the cooler.  They just pulled the seat down and got what they needed without our having to stop and open the trunk.

The major drawback that we encountered with the Impala (and it could be that it was just the model that we rented and not on every model--we haven't checked it out--yet!) was the air conditioning system.  It worked fine as far as output and easy controls etc.  The thing we didn't like was the vent system.  The way the dash was designed in this particular car the vents were directed at the driver and front passenger.  When we tried to turn the vents to direct the air more toward the back seat or away from our faces it didn't seem to move very much.  No matter where we turned the vents, the air still seemed to be blowing directly at us.  The kids complained of being warm in the back seat and we were freezing in the front and couldn't get the air to stop blowing on us.  I don't know if it is the dash design or the type of vents but it was something we really didn't like and could possibly keep us from purchasing an Impala.

As I said earlier, it may  be possible to get a different option in A/C vents or dashes or even a rear seat vent but the system in the model we drove was not designed very well.

The seats had enough adjustment settings to make the ride comfortable and relaxing for all occupants.  Also, the back seats had &quot;child straps&quot; for the seat belts.  There were little clips attached to the back seats that you can hook to the seat belt shoulder straps so that smaller children can wear them comfortably.  This was something else that my children liked.  Shoulder seat belts are always something that bother them because they cut across their necks.  

If you are looking for a comfortable, roomy, sporty looking, 4-door car that gets great gas mileage, the Chevrolet Impala may be something you will want to check out.  The price is reasonable and having owned Chevys all my life I've never had anything but good luck with them.

I also recommend a lengthy test drive in any car you are considering or if possible do something like we did and rent one for a time so you can check it out under many different circumstances.  It will help you to make a more informed buying decision.
