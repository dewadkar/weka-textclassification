            I traded in a perfectly good '00 Nissan Frontier Desert Runner (SE V6) with low miles for an Alpine White Impreza WRX SportWagon in December of '01 because I wanted a vehicle with more class and amenities, and nearly the same utility. One year later, I am amazed that this car can still bring a huge grin to my face every time I get behind the wheel. I've owned 2 small pickups, a '91 Integra, and an '86 Subaru GL-10 turbo wagon, so I guess you could say I've come full circle in my car ownership history. 

The Impreza is ten times the car the GL-10 was, but as with the GL, AWD is the real to-die-for feature. In addition to the awesome rush of acceleration one experiences with a 3500 RPM clutch-slipping blast off, the Impreza holds the pavement, wet or dry, snowy, sandy, or otherwise, with a tenacity equal to AWD systems on cars and trucks that cost much more. Its simple yet effective non-computerized torque splitting differentials just work. 

The Impreza's handling is taut and somewhat firm, though much more compliant than several other cars in the $18-$25K segment that I've driven, most notably the Acura RSX-S type. That car's ride is very firm, bordering on uncomfortable, and I'll gladly take the Suby's softer yet equally responsive suspension. Braking has been another strong point, in my experience, though I've only had to make one or two borderline panic stops. Pedal feel is firm and consistent, though the overly sensitive ABS sensors have caused the system to activate most unexpectedly a couple times over expansion joints, raised brick-inlaid crosswalks, and the like. However, you gotta have some whoa to complement the Impreza WRX's 2 liters of turbocharged flat-4 go, and I've found no other issues with the braking of the car. 

The interior is to my liking, with its dark dash and textured / patterned main seat fabric, though some people have complained that the softer fabric on the side bolsters of the seat cushions does not wear well. I've not noticed this, and I wonder if those who have issues don't properly climb in the car and simply swing their legs across the bolsters, thereby causing it to deteriorate more rapidly... Mats are ok, nothing special, and I purchased a rubber cargo tray liner for the rear to keep things from sliding and the interior protected. 

The 6 disc in dash CD changer is awesome, though the LCD display can be difficult to read while wearing sunglasses. The factory speakers are no great shakes, but suit me fine. I might consider upgrading them (but maintain the stock head unit) sometime in the future. The gauges are very clear and legible, though I wish I would have opted for a boost gauge. I don't plan on modifying intake or exhaust, but I might just have to get an EBC (electronic boost controller) for kicks, and now I'll need a separate boost gauge unless I spring for an EBC with an integrated one (more $$$, natch). The armrest extension is a great feature, and I'm glad my car had it installed as an option. Window and mirror switches work well, though it'd be nice if they were lighted. The only issue I've had thus far with the interior is its lack of an optional sunroof. I don't know why Subaru chose not to offer one, as my old GL-10 had a small sunroof that I used extensively. 

On to the transmission, which is, in my opinion, perfectly sound, though prone to some "interesting" behavior. Some folks have had clutch wear issues (obvious cause - 227 horses and an over-eager right foot!), others think the trannies are fragile in general, but I don't share their views. I don't abuse my car, but I do drive spiritedly and I just can't see what all the hubbub is about. Throws are not short with the stock shifter, but are precise and require more effort than Hondas, Toyotas, or Nissans that I've driven. The "interesting" behavior I've noticed (and others have written about on i-club.com, etc., as well) is something that has come to be termed "clutch shudder". This only occurs when the car is first started and a 1st gear start is attempted. It seems that the tranny wants more power than is normally required for a standing start, and the car will shimmy / shudder for a second or two as the tranny spins up (my non-technical evaluation :-). This disappears once the car has warmed up, though it happens fairly consistently and requires one to pay attention to those first few shifts of the drive. Give it a bit more gas and clutch slip than you would when it's fully warmed up, and it doesn't seem to happen as much, if at all. 

Overall, I feel I did pretty well in my attempt to replace the Nissan with a classier, more well-appointed vehicle. At almost $25K, it cost a bit more than I thought I'd spend, but it's been worth every penny thus far. The SportWagon has a security system with keyless entry (a luxury I never had previously), nice 16" alloys, and fog lights that definitely complement the car's character. Its looks are aging well, the paint is holding up, and I still look forward to driving it. Mileage has been less than stellar at ~21 mpg all-around and ~25 mpg highway. The Impreza is and has been an above-average package of a car, and Subaru did all of us in the US a favor by bringing the awesome WRX version to our shores. The latest generation Impreza's looks may not be for everyone, but its power, poise, handling, and functionality won me over in a heartbeat. That, and the super-cool MOMO steering wheel. Didn't think I'd neglect to mention it did you? :-)

UPDATE: (originally posted as a comment on 1/26)

Just thought I'd add that I've taken 4 longer road trips ( &gt; 200 miles) in the past month and I've noticed that mileage has improved somewhat, with an average of about 27 mpg for highway cruising, best of almost 30 mpg. Perhaps things are tightening up at around 8500 miles (yes, I don't drive too much and my 1 year old car is a ways from 10K), but in any case, it's a welcome development to have better mpg on highway cruises. Around town is also just a bit better as well at ~22. If I really get on it, however, I'm lucky to see 20 mpg.
