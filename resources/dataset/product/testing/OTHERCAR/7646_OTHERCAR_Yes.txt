            I cannot believe that I am sitting here writing a review on an automobile. I am so pleasantly surprised however with my love of our 2002 Mercury Mountaineer that I had to throw in my two cents.

Having one grown child, I never thought that I would be in the market for an SUV, van or anything other than a sedan. 

This is my 5th lease with Mercury.  Hey, leasing works for me and I am very happy with it. So any negatives on this subject should be put aside.

When we went to our Dealership to review our turn-in options for my 99 Sable, I was shocked that my other half suggested that we look at the Mercury Villager and the Mountaineer.  "Me? Drive a van or a truck?  What are you crazy?" was my response. He gently reminded me that we do a lot of lugging with our catering business and never seem to have enough room when we shop.  He thought it was worth looking into. 

My biggest concern with either a van or an SUV was whether I would be able to handle it. I am only 5 feet tall and have had problems driving cars whereby I cannot see over the front when I am parking or turning. And they just look so big. Soooo, I requested taking the Mountaineer on a test drive. I should add in here that I am a seasoned, long time driver but I have not driven much in the last couple of years, so it was a little frightening getting behind the wheel.

I was in love immediately. What control!  What luxury! What grace and agility!  Could I possible feel this way about a truck?    

The first things that I noted were a)the sense of security and b)the sense of control in that I had complete visual clearance. It was easier to drive than anything that I have driven before. I even parallel parked it perfectly on the first try. I will admit here that when I received the call to pick it up, my better half was unable to join me and I whimped out and invited a male friend to drive it home. I preferred getting used to the local streets before taking it on a highway so I eased my way into driving it.

Here are the specifications listed by epinions and some that I am throwing in with the literature that I was provided with:

<b>Available Engines</b>	4.0L, 6 cyl.  (I have a 6) According to my brochure, there is a 4.6L SOHC V8 available that is said  to offer more horsepower (239 to be exact) than any other previous V8 engine. 

<b>Estimated Invoice Price</b>	$26,256 - $28,018

<b>Estimated List Price</b>	$28,630 - $30,610

<b>Estimated Price</b>	        $20,000 to $30,000 $30,000 to $40,000 (Mine is around $34K)

<b>Fuel Type</b>	        Gasoline

<b>Fuel Capacity</b>            22.5 gal 

<b>Miles per Gallon</b> 	15/20 (We donï¿½t get that    much sine we do mostly city driving)

<b>Seating Capacity</b>	        5(Mine seats 7. The disappearing third row bench seat offers best-in-class head 
and leg room and great cargo capacity. I don't know why Epinions lists 5)

<b>Type</b>              	Sport Utility Vehicles

<b> Transmission</b>            Five-speed electronic automatic overdrive with automatic overdrive switch.

<b>Towing capacities</b>         3500 - 7300 pounds depending on model.

It is my understanding that there were problems with some of the previous year's models and Mercury spent a lot of money to improve the 2002.  It is also my understanding that this model has one of the highest safety records among SUV's. One factor is attributed to the wide-angle turns that it's technology provides. There is no tilting when making turns.

My model has all-wheel drive or <b>AWD.</b> This system adapts automatically to all driving challenges. It also has four-wheel independent suspension and four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes.

My model has power-adjustable foot pedals that provide a three inch range that adapt to drivers of different statures, providing ultimate comfort and ease of adjustment. Mine has a memory feature which allows to drivers to program their settings.  This may sound a little snobby, but I found this feature to be great.  I hate readjusting after someone else drives.

<b>Standard Features include:</b>

Dual front air bags
Passive anti-theft system
Remote keyless entry system
Luggage rack
Side repeater lamps
Premium Am/FM stereo/ 6 disc-in dash CD player 

Naturally there are many more but I am just including those that I thought would be of interest and not always considered standard.

<b>Optional and Optional Group that I have are:</b> 

Side curtain air bags
Power adjusted foot pedals w/ memory feature
Digital compass and outside whether display
Trailer tow package
Approach lights on exterior mirrors
Heated exterior mirrors
Running boards
Auxiliary Climate control with 6 rear vents, overhead rear controls and dual electronic automatic temperature controls for driver and front passenger.
Heated leather seats
Electrochromic  (auto-dimming) rearview mirror)
Message center
Moonroof
6 way power seats with lumbar adjustments

Since we eat and have coffee on the run, it was important for us to consider the console and the cup holders.  This SUV is perfect for us in that capacity.  The Sable had horrible cup holders that always resulted in spillage when in use.  One of the great features about the Mountaineer is that in addition to great console space, right behind the front passenger seat is an additional fold down for two more cups.

Having had been in a near-fatal collision years ago, my primary concern when choosing an auto is safety and security. I have never felt so secure in anything.  The luxuries that we have with this vehicle, while not necessary, are greatly appreciated.

Before closing I would like to add two important factors that I considered that I hope you don't have to, but sadly many people do need to.  I have a severely handicapped brother who I enjoy taking places. He was unable to get in and out of my Sable.  This is perfect for him.  The running boards and the hand grips help a great deal.  Plus, we have great storage capacity for his wheelchair and for his portable oxygen.

My parents are both in their mid seventies and one is more crippled with arthritis than the other. They both find ease in getting in and out of this vehicle.  I too find it extremely comfortable. I had trouble getting in an out of the Sable and was very stiff after short rides.     

If you are in the market for a new transport, don't hesitate to check out this fine vehicle. I am certain that you will not be sorry.
