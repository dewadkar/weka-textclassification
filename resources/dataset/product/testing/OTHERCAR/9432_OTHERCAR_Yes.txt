            In 1997, I had just gotten my license and was looking to buy a car that I would be able to afford.  I looked at the Ford Aspire, which was about $10,000 new, but decided that I might be better off with a better quality used car for about the same price.

A large factor into my decision of buying a Jetta is the resale value - the other car I was looking at only had a resale value of about $2,000 in a couple of years, while the Jetta, already 3 years old, could perhaps bring $8,000.

It's a very well-designed car, and fit me and 4 friends comfortably every weekend in high school.  The trunk is even comfy, and you could always curl up in a ball and take a nap in it, or put down the back seat and stretch out.  It has a cup holder for the back and two for the front, which is very useful.

My Jetta has manual windows, a sunroof, and a Volkswagon radio.  I am happy with everything about the car, and I've only had to do routine maintenance.  Plus, the Jetta is a great companion (at least mine is).  You should buy a Jetta if you're looking for a friend, not just a vehicle.  An added bonus is that the 1994 model looks the same as the ones made for a few years after that, so most people don't believe that my car's actually 6 years old.<br><br>
