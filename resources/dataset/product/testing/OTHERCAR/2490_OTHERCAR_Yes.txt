               My wife and I just purchased a 1995 Hyundai Elantra.  We just had a child and decided we needed more than the trucks we owned offered.  We were pretty much decided on buying a Ford Escort until we ran across this little jewel.  The car had just been sold at a public auction and the person that bought it needed some money.  It wasn't what we thought we wanted until we took it for a test drive, and absolutely loved it.  It has so many options and such a comfortable ride.  We just had to have it, and the price was only $2150.00.  We ended up going home that day with a great car and money to spend.  I would recommend this car to anyone.<br><br>
