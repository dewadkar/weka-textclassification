            When I was growing up my grandparents had the quintessential uncool car, a 1968 model station wagon.  Growing up in rural Kentucky you see a lot of minivans, or vehicles that used to be minivans before someone converted them into a NASCAR mobile or a pseudo truck used for hauling gravel/auto parts/trash.  By the age of 8 I combined these two ideas and decided that it would be a cold day in heck before I drove a minivan/station wagon.  As a teenager I scoffed at those teens that drove minivans.  Sure they had a ride and I didn�t but I figured even walking was cooler than driving a minivan.

Over Christmas break I was visiting one of my aunts and she told me that they had recently purchased a 2001 Honda Odyssey minivan.  Up until that point I thought that this aunt, and my uncle-in-law, were the coolest of my relatives.  They are fairly liberal, former hippies who are often easier to talk to than my parents.  I could not believe that they had sold out and bought a minivan, never mind that they have four children.  At about that point my ex-cool uncle drove up in the new minivan.  On my way out to see the new vehicle I tripped over their weiner dog, Heidi, on my way out.  Heidi (<i>note- this dog is so ugly that it shames its Scandinavian namesake!</i>) yelped and I went flying, landing at the foot of the Odyssey.

My personal thoughts on the Odyssey are below.

<b>Models:</b>

There are two basic models of the Honda Odyssey- the LX and the EX.  The LX is the base model.  Let us first concentrate on the LX�s specifications.  Afterwards I shall discuss the extras that the EX has. 

<i>LX:</i>

* Sliding left rear and right rear passenger doors
* Liftback rear cargo door (Very easy to open even with a child in your arms)
* Aero-composite halogen headlamps (I wish my car has these, they throw out so much light.)
* 215/65 tires on steel wheels; and full hubcaps
* AM/FM radio and 4 speakers
* Cruise control; controls on steering wheel
* Power door locks
* Power tinted front windows and rear vent windows
* Driver seat controls allow 8-way adjustment; Passenger seat allows 4-way adjustment

<i>EX:</i>

The EX has all of the same amenities of the LX and a couple of extra goodies-

* Roof rack
* Auto-off Aero-composite halogen headlamps (I don�t know why they don�t put this on the LX as well)
* Air conditioning with climate control
* AM/FM radio/CD player; 6 speakers; controls on steering wheel
* Theft deterrent and alarm system; panic alarm
* Keyless entry
* Driver seat allows 8-way power adjustment; lumbar support
* 215/65 tires on alloy rims (Very stylish!)

<b>Styling</b>

I don�t really know how to describe this minivan, it is just so sharp looking.  You can see the similarities between the Odyssey and the Accord.  The Odyssey employs sharp lines and a distinct grill, both of which make this minivan stand out in a crowd.

This minivan does not look like your grandparents minivan.  It is sharp and unmistakable.  The best way to sum up the Odyssey�s styling is this- you probably won�t turn many heads on the street, after all it�s a minivan not a Porsche!  But you will be happy with the look, it is a solid looking vehicle that commands respect and attention.

<b>Engine, Brakes, Suspension and Other Technical Aspects:</b>

The front wheel drive Honda Odyssey is powered by a strong 3.5 V6 SOHC engine which makes 210 horses.  Torque is strong at 229, and we have pulled several large boats with the Odyssey without any power problems.  Only one transmission is offered, an automatic 4-speed.  Acceleration is forceful although I am not sure of the 0-60 MPH time.  Who drag races minivans anyway?  Ok, yeah I tried to race an Accord but I lost.  To be fair I had seven people in my vehicle compared to only the driver of the Accord.  Sorry, I went off a tangent!  Smack me if I do it again.

When you first start up the vehicle, always on the first crank, you will be surprised at how quiet it idles.  I have been sitting in the Odyssey, waiting to pick up someone, and forgotten that it is on.  It is that quiet!  Once or twice I even cranked the engine when it was already started.  A couple of passerbys became quite alarmed and glanced my way but I just looked around, feigning innocence!

I was very pleased with how smooth and even the power comes on.  Shifting is so smooth that you cannot feel shifts even while you are pressing the pedal to the metal!  The Odyssey manages its power delivery well, giving you excellent pickup but no surprising jerks.  <i>Warning Note- violently slamming the accelerator to the floor while stopped will result in tire squeal.  I can attest to the fact that fellow motorists become flabbergasted when a minivan screeches off from a stoplight.  This is also great because nearby police will not associate the sound with your �slow� minivan!</i>

The Odyssey�s suspension is rare for a minivan- fully independent.  This is accomplished using MacPherson struts and lower A-arms in the front and a double wishbone system in the rear.  This system soaks up the bumps and affords you tight handling.

Front disc and rear drum brakes are standard, as are anti-lock brakes.  Stopping distances are about average but I found the brake pedal to be rather soft with a spongy feel.

Fuel economy is average, approximately 19 mpg in the city and 25 mpg on the freeway. Combine this with a 20 gallon fuel tank and you have a good driving range.

<b>Handling:</b>

As mentioned above the independent suspension really makes driving the Odyssey easy, even pleasurable.  Hitting all but the most extreme road hazards is a not a problem as neither you nor your passengers will be jolted.  This is great for parents of young children who don�t want the baby awakened after they finally go to sleep.  Big potholes will cause a little steering wheel shaking, a disappointment in this otherwise fine handling vehicle.  This has to be the most plush ride I have witnessed in any car short of a luxury ride.  The low center of gravity really helps the Odyssey out, enabling quick and fairly precise steering.  I feel like this might be a problem, however, in that the ride is almost numb.  I would advise anyone who wants to �feel� the road to look elsewhere.  But hey, until Ferrari produces a minivan I wouldn�t waste my time looking for a sports minivan!

Straightaways and curves are each handled the same- with excellent traction and minimal body roll.  Engine vibration is not transferred to occupants, even at 95 MPH. Umm, yeah I have first hand experience.  The traction control system, now standard on both the LX and EX, keeps the Odyssey firmly on the ground.  Excellent stability is par for the course in this vehicle.
			
Odyssey also has a pretty tight turning radius, a big plus for minivan owners who often maneuver in close quarters, such as parking lots.

<b>Interior:</b>

The Honda Odyssey is very well equipped, justifying its high price.  As seen above, even the base model has numerous features which are often only found on high-end minivans, or not at all.

If you have children you will be happy to note that the Odyssey has child safety seat tethers for all of the second and third row seats.

For your hauling needs you will be quite happy with the third row seat that easily folds right into the floor.  This is the only minivan in its class that incorporates this feature, greatly increasing usable cargo space.                   

The Odyssey is fairly roomy.  Seven people can fit inside comfortably.  One great feature, if you want to call it that, is that the aisle between the front seat and the second row seats is large enough for easy movement between the two sections.  This is very handy for parents who need to reach their children.  While the front and second row seats are comfortable and provide plenty of head and leg room, especially for the driver, the third row is a little cramped and would be most suitable for children. 

While riding in the Odyssey you are struck by just how high you are.  Despite this it is easy to get in and out of the vehicle.  There is very little road noise.  The controls are well placed and the gauges can be read at a glance.

One problem I have to mention is the awkwardly long column mounted gear selector.  Unfortunately it obstructs blocks some of the radio controls. Another problem with the shifter is that it slides into gear too easily, which could result in an accidental gear change.

<b>Miscellaneous:</b>

One of the nicest features on my aunt�s Odyssey EX is the navigation system.  Man this thing is slick.  It really helps keep you on track when you are on trips and finding your way is so easy.  The downside is this little goodie will cost you extra $2,000.  A little rich for my blood.

<b>Conclusion:</b>

I <b>highly recommend</b> this vehicle.  The 2001 Honda Odyssey is one nice vehicle, period.  It is sharp looking, solid, reliable, full of options, and powerful.  Everything you could possibly want in a minivan.  It is expensive but consider what you get.  The standard options are first in the class as is the handling.  I cannot think of another minivan that offers so much class and so much function.  Function is the key to a minivan, but the Odyssey proves that you can be a class-leading worker and still be fun.  If I was in the market for a minivan this would be it, no doubt about it.  It made a believer out of me.  Two thumbs up!
