            This is the first car I have ever owned, my parents bought it for me and I simply love it. It's easy to drive, everything is easy to find inside, has great gas mileage (which is great for a student), is a great comuter car, and has a large amount of storage room (because you can put down the back seat and have a sort of mini covered flatbed truck!) I do admit that it would be nice if it had four doors but thats the only thing i would change. I also like the fact that it is a hatch back.

Me and my best friend can easily say that we've put my car through its paces. It has great accelaration, did you know that such a small car can have better pickup then a ford truck? I can't say anymore just in case my parents read this =) , it can go off roading quite well, but will get a bit dirty. It also is a great winter driver with front wheel drive, but tends to get stuck easily in a foot of snow.  

Some people make fun of it at times because its a 'little' small, but that doesn't stop me from loving it. I know that my car will always be there for me, my Dad owned one for years and it never had a problem. I will never have enough to say about how great this car is. 
Rock on Suzuki Swift!
