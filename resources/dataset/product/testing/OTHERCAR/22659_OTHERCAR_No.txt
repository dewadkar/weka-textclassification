            I love driving this car but the amount of repairs are very dissapointing. This is my second diesel Jetta, the last one was a 1997 model and I should have kept it. Here is some history on this new model Jetta. A wheel alignement was needed at the first tire rotation, 6000 miles,( the tires on the back were wearing unevenly). Volks Warranty covered it. At 7000 miles Glow plugs kept on blowing a fuse, short in system that was covered on warranty. At 20,000 miles the tires had broken belts they were Goodyears. The Good year Dealer in town would not honor the tire warranty on any Volkswagen because of  inherrant rear wheel allignement problems. I purchased a set of Michelins, no problems to report on the tires after 50,000 miles. The front rotors were changed out at 23,000 miles. They were warped Volks warranty covered the repairs. At 25,000 miles the glow plug control unit had to be replaced. Volks warranty covered it. At 50,000 miles the engine kept cutting out and the engine warning light kept comming on. The dealer found a defective brake light switch that kept on shorting out the ignition. The switch cost $35 and the diagnostics cost $250, In Canada the warranty is over at 50,000 miles(80,000KM). At 55,000 miles the water pump was replaced, Volks paid half. The Timing belt was replaced at the same time at for $600 dollars, it is scheduled maintenance. The car also had to have the entire intake manifold cleaned out, it was totally gummed up. Volks paid for this it is a known problem on the New TDI models. This problem starts being noticed around 60,000 miles. Your car will not be as responsive , the intake manifold starts sealing off with tar. Now I have just a little over 60,000 miles on the car and the cruise won't work and the car hesitates at 2500 RPM. The dealer informed me that the engine control unit is shot , it costs $850 just to buy. The dealer refused to cover the repair even though the ECM is covered for 8 years in Canada. His reason for this is that it is only covered if you have emission control problems not anything else. Where was this guy educated? I phoned Volkswagen and Volks covered the repair under warranty.The plastic glove box hinge just broke in the cold weather, I was Gentle with it it should not have broke. The new hinge is only $115 , cheap compared to the price of the ECM.
I am truly sorry that I cannot give this car high marks, it is now for sale and I am scared to buy another Volks. God forbid I might buy a saturn.
