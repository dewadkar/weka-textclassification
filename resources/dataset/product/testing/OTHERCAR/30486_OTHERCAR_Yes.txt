            I owned an 86 Corolla for 2 years, '95 and '96.  I didn't buy, my brother gave it to me, because he was leaving the country.  Despite the fact that it was a ten year old car with over 100,000 miles it ran well.  My brother had given it considerable abuse, driving at speeds which this car was not meant to reach, but the engine was still good.  I had an accident which did 2,000 dollars worth of damage to the front of the car.  The radiator did not break, and the car ran just fine.  I hit a boulder, and had to replace the oil pan, nothing else.  However, I did the regular tune-up work myself (i.e. changing oil, filters, sparkplugs), and found the engine really uncomfortable to work with.  The engine space is small, and in an awkward position.  The drive was satisfactory and the handling was excellent.  It accelerated poorly, as I would expect of a ten year old sedan.  Excellent for people who want a very low-priced vehicle that will not break down easily.  The price listed, is what I sold the car for in December 1996.<br><br>
