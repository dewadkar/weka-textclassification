            This is a nice car.  Sure, its not as fashionable as a Mercedes, or a lexus, but it gets you where you want to go in comfort.  I have been driving this car for a little under a year and I wouldn't trade it for anything.  It has nice braking and turning capabilities.  Also, it is very stable, and the suspension isn't all over the place like in other mini vans.  For an older car, it is a pretty good vehicle.  The only thing I dislike about it is that it takes a long time for the car to get warmed up.  On long ski trips up north, we have to leave the car running for 15 minutes before the heater shoots out hot air.  Also, the lights are not very good, but I think that is because it is an older model.  If you need a nice, comfortable family car, for a decent price, give the Chrysler Town &amp; Country a try.<br><br>
