                I bought my new corvette after testing the firebird and mustang, as well as some more expensive cars such as the acura NSX and a BMW M3.  I found the Corvette to be the best performing car on the market for the money, and while some cars are a few tenths of a second faster, they cannot compare with the Corvette's price.
    I happened to opt for the ZO6 high performance version, which rated higher than a 550 maranello in a test comparing top speed to price and luxury, as well as drive ability and style.  This car amazes me every time I drive it.   
    If I had the decision to make again, there is no way I would choose another car.  None currently built can compare to the corvette as far as price and overall performance are concerned.
    Being an Automotive Engineer, you can trust me on my decision, I wish i could claim to have designed this car.  New features such as the titanium exhaust prove chevy's commitment to build a true sports car with few compromises. <br><br>
