            WOW!!! Less than $10,000 dollars!!!!!!
This is what I said when I saw how pretty this car was. I test drove it. It was fast. A 3.1 6 cylinder. I like fast cars. I was happy. Not much down, not many miles. Used. As is. 
I thought I was the queen of fast cars. I was until my Intrepid went into the transmission shop. And then the brakes went out. Both front and back. Had to have the drums replaced in the back, the front pads AND calipers. Ok, after shelling out all that, everything was normal for a month. THe front end starts shaking like Jerry Lee Lewis's fingers on a piano...Took it in again, the left front tie rods were out. Bearings as well. Got that fixed. Ok, so far that's $9,999.00 for the price of the car, $300 for transmission, $250.00 for the brakes, $150.00 for the tie rods and bearings. Now after this, 2 months later, tire replacing time. $379.00. *sigh*. Alignment went wrong. Real wrong. Now my fast Dodge was still a fast Dodge. Just wasn't going anywhere. Thank goodness I was financing it!!! Repo or no repo this piece was going back!! Couldn't do the lemon law thing. There was no other way around it. I lost my car. Good thing though. I later found out when it was too late, all the recalls. There are 3. All of which went wrong with my car. Too bad. You win some, you lose some. Look for an epinion on classics by me. That's a Cinderella story!!<br><br>
