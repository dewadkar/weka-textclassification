            I bought my '96 Corsica around Thanksgiving of 1998 with about 28K miles on it. I had an '88 Corsica that I had a wonderful experience with. I guess I'm just stupid, but when I finally gave my '88 to my son with 150K miles on it, I decided to try a '93 Taurus. BIG MISTAKE ! That car cost me big bucks, mainly in A/C and transmission problems.

Anyway, back to the subject. I wanted the 4-cyl. engine because that's what my '88 had. My long time mechanic was an ex-GM mechanic and said the 4-cyl. 2-liter engine was one of the most reliable GM had ever produced. For the size and weight of the car, this engine seems to have plenty of power. It doesn't bog down at all with the A/C on either. As of this writing I still own the car and it has 115K miles on it. I feel like it's just now &quot;broken in&quot;. The '88 I gave to my son had 228K miles on it when he sold it for $ 350. It was still running even though it looked awful.

My '96 doesn't have a lot of bell &amp; whistles on it. Power windows and locks, stereo cassette, and that's about it. I'm in sales and I drive a lot; about 30K-35K miles per year. What I need is reliable and economical transportation. I drive alot of mixed city and freeway miles. I kept a mileage log on both my Corsicas for about 50K miles. In both cases, I averaged between 30 and 31 MPG for all my driving. I do my oil changes at about 5K miles.

In my experience, if you do the regular, routine maintenance such as oil changes, belts, hoses, brakes, fluid levels, etc., this is a wonderfully reliable set of wheels. I never worry about it getting stolen, because it's not very sexy. The insurance is very reasonable as is the regular maintenance. What I like most about it is that I know it's gonna start in the morning and it's gonna get me where I want to go comfortably. I just wish they were still making them.<br><br>
