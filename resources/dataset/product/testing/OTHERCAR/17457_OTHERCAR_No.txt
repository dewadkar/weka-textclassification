            A year and a half ago, I set out to buy a new car. I was looking for something with good gas mileage, yet sporty. I was also looking for a car that I new would last. The *only* manufacturer that came to mind was Honda. My family has owned many Honda's through the years and they have always lasted forever, been built with quality in mind, and held their resale value. So I bought a Prelude. 

Don't get me wrong, I love zipping around in a little red sporty Honda, but some of the little quirks are starting to get to me. For instance, for about 3 months last year, every time I turned left, the power locks would engage. Strange? Sometimes when I turn the car on the doors lock three or four times. Honda dealers have told me there is nothing wrong with my electrical system. Also, the &quot;metal&quot; door handles are peeling off, how do you fix that? Finally, on cold mornings when I leave my parking spot, the car makes a metallic groan, like it's frame is not as ready to get up and go as I am. <br><br>
