            I bought this camera in Oct. 99 for 239 on clearance at sears. It was the floor model, but in perfect shape. Twenty dollars went towards an extended warrenty as I was leary on purchasing a &quot;used&quot; item. I must say, I have been impressed with the performance. I love the way I can take pictures and easily download them to my computer. I know this is not a top of the line camera, but it meets my needs -- to keep distant family up to date with the growth of our children.
 I don't use many of the features, as I do not need them, but it is nice to know they are there. I have played with all the features.  The smart media cards that are like mini floppy disks can hold a large amount of pictures. The LCD display is a great way to immediately know if you got a good shot, or if you should retake the picture.
 It is pretty simplistic to use, although it comes with a long manual. I wound up &quot;playing&quot; to learn how to use it, and referring to the manual when I got &quot;stuck&quot;. It has a USB interface, and quickly downloads to the computer.
 It comes with 4 batteries so that you can constantly have a set charging, and for emergencies, 2 double A batteries can substitute for taking pictures without using the LCD.
 I am sure now, 6 months after the fact, I could find a mega pixel camera for the cost or a little bit more than what I paid for this low end camera, but I am very pleased with it.<br><br>
