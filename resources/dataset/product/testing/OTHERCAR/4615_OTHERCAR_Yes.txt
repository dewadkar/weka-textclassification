            I'll admit up front that I'm a bit biased, I've wanted a Corvette since I was 8 years old, but it wasn't until the C5's did I absolutely fall head over heels.  I was fortunate enough this year to be able to purchase a new 2001 triple black convertible automatic with Z51 suspension, HUD, and polished aluminum wheels, and I must say that it is everything I dreamed it would be and more.

You'll see many people compare this car to BMW's, Fords, Dodge's, even Ferrari's, but this comparing apples to oranges - the Corvette is in a class all by itself.

Rather than regurgitate the same horsepower/handling rhetoric that appears so often in reviews, I'll focus on what I love most about the car.  If you are looking for these things, then this is the only car for you:

<b>Size:</b>  Many enthusiasts say that the Corvette is too large for a sports car.  I am 6'4" and this is the only sports car that I fit <i>really</i> comfortably in.  The car is very nimble thanks to a WIDE wheel base and big, fat tires that glue you to the road.

<b>Styling:</b>  This thing commands attention.  It looks more like a laser-guided tactical weapon than a car.  If you don't want to attract attention to yourself, this is not the car for you.

<b>Speed:</b>  0-60 in under 5 seconds is mad speed for any car, let along a convertible.  A $1000 Borla exhaust and a $400 K&M intake have my car getting to 60 in about 4.3.

<b>Interior:</b>  I've heard the interior called "cheap" and "plastic-y" - this is nonsense.  This is a high-tech no-nonsense performance cockpit.  If you look into a Corvette and wonder where the woodgrain is, you just don't get what the Corvette is all about.  You won't find woodgrain in an F-15 either.

This is the ultimate combination of power, comfort, cruisability, attention-grabbing, street-ripping, fun on wheels.  There is no substitute at any price.
