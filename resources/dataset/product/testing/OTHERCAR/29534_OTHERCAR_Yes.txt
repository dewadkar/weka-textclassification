            After a month of use, the DC-240 appears to be a fine camera. Its image quality is nice but you need to experiment, particularly indoors. The 3X optical zoom is a nice bonus in a point and shoot of this price range. Forget the digital zoom ESPECIALLY indoors. 

Controls are easy to figure and use. Nice user Interface. Yes, the LCD is positioned a bit too far to the left but you can get used to it. Ergonomic design is well thought out and accessible. Lens cap doesn't fall off. I find that I have to be careful grabbing on to it so I don't smudge the viewer.

This is basically a nice all around cameral. Staples met an on-line price of $365.00, so I thought it was a decent value. The Olympus 460Z is another fine camera with arguably better image quality at about the same price, but has no USB or rechargeable batteries and comes with smart-media instead of compact flash.

Kodak's web site is comprehensive and useful. Considering all the features and options, once you get used to taking digital pix, you'll find this to be a fine choice. Just make sure you do some shopping and take Staples or another merchant up on the price match, if offered. You can't go wrong. <br><br>
