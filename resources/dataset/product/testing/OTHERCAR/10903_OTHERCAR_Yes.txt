            I have been driving a 2000 BMW 323i 4 Door Sedan since June first of 1999, and have enjoyed it immensely.  For an entry price of under $30,000, one can purchase a 4 door sedan that has compact external dimensions and handles like a sports car, and still has 4 doors and room for 4 people and their belongings.

Like all BMW products, the steering provides tremendous feedback and excellent transient response (especially noticeable in the slalom course), and is quite neutral.  Not only is the car light at 3,153 lbs., but with a weight distribution of 51%/49% Front/Rear, the car will ultimately understeer as it approaches its very high cornering limit.

The 2.5 liter inline six cylinder engine is extremely smooth and quiet, and produces a respectable 170 horsepower and 181 ft/lbs of torque.  0-60 is quoted at 7.1 seconds with the test cars' manual transmission, and top speed (observed) is 128 mph.  The 5 speed manual transmission is silky smooth with a very light clutch.

This type of performance is not inexpensive, and the base list price is $27,560.  As tested, with the Premium Package, Leather Interior, Heated Seats and In-Dash CD Player, the car came to a list price of $33,680.  While this is certainly not inexpensive, it certainly is reasonable in view of the performance level provided by the 323.
