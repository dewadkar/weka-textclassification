            I've owned my 01 Outback wagon for a year now and have put about 20,000 miles on it and have been very impressed with this car's capabilities.  Specifically, I love having the added security of AWD to get me through any type of weather -- this car will truely plow through snow that will stop other vehicles in their tracks.  The other night brought one of the biggest snow storms to the area since 1996 and I needed to take one of my dogs to the vet to get stitches. The roads were unplowed and there was 8 to 10 inches of fresh snow on the ground, but the car refused to give up.  We made it up a steep 4 lane road that had left many motorists stranded at the bottom (including a new 4x4 Tacoma and a late 90's Chevy 4x4).  The trucks were fishtailing and struggling to maintain traction while the Outback plowed on -- the limited slip center and rear differentials are more than just marketing hype and seem to really keep the car moving in the right direction.  Other specific likes with this car: the 4 cyl engine makes a very distinctive sound under power and moves pretty well with the 5 speed transmission, although I still wish for more power just off idle.  Once moving, the car pulls quite strongly.  There is a ton of space in this wagon -- enough to carry a loveseat home the other day, in fact.  The transmission shifts as well as my previous Hondas, but I am a bit concerned about the clutch, which chatters in cold weather. Subaru says this is normal, but it still concerns me.  At speed, this car is very, very quiet with very little road or wind noise in the cabin.  One thing I do not like is the gas mileage -- I rarely get over 23mpg regardless of city or highway driving.  The highest I ever achieved was 26mpg, which is still below the EPA estimates.  I feel like a 4 cylinder engine linked to a manual transmission should do a little better than that.  Still, it's light years better than the 97 Explorer I had for a while. The 7.3 inches of ground clearance are nice in the Outback, but the front and rear overhangs are so long that off-roading is really tough in this car -- the bumpers will scrape quite easily on moderate inclines.  Still, the car has tackled many rocky, rutted roads with ease.  I would not hesitate to buy this car again.
