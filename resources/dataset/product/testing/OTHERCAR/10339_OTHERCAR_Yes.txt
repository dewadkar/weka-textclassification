            INTRODUCTION

When our 1990 Toyota Camry that we bought new broke down after 180,000 miles, my dad and I set out to buy a brand new Toyota. Since it had been eleven years since a new car, we weren't sure what to expect and purchase. In 1998, my mom purchased a new Camry, and to this date, it has 86,000 miles with NO problems, and drives like brand new. On June 16, 2001, we went to our dealer, Don Wood Automotive, in Athens, OH. 

LOOKING AT THE CARS

We arrived and were praised by the nice Toyotas on the lot. I really wanted to get a new Camry, but my dad was looking for something like his old Camry. We saw an Echo, but my dad felt it was too small, considering that we are all 6' tall. Then, my dad and I approached a white 2001 Toyota Corolla CE with a freshened up front and rear design. By the way, the EPINIONS picture is portraying a 1998-2000 model, the 2001-2002 had the slight face lift. Anyway, back to the car, the shine was unbelievable. The bright white paint stood out and the chrome trim around the grille made it look very nice and shiny. The interior was Oak. It took no time for my dad and I to take interest to the car.

INTERIOR

The interior was done in Oak finish. Materials were soft and nicely padded, and the seats were very comfortable. There was no tachometer, but that didn't matter to us. The two cup holders were in a good location for me, on the dash, because I like to rest my right hand on the gear shift. Well, when I do this in my mom's Camry, my right hand touches the cups in the center console. I feel the cup holders are in a perfect spot on the Corolla, and it may somewhat block the A/C controls, but I can easily reach right around the cups. There was no center console, but there was a cubby hole to hold change and other items, like our old Camry. The steering wheel felt great to the hands, although it being a base CE model (which replaced the VE for 2001), it had no tilt. That was fine for me, as it was in a good position. The sound system was an AM/FM Cassette, like my mom's Camry, only w/o CD player, and with two less speakers. The sound system is still great though for a base model. A CD player can be had by an expansion bay located below the cup holders. For the rear of the cabin, there is a centrally located single cup holder at the base of the center area. My mom's Camry has two in the back, but I am usually always the only one in the backseat, which brings me to my gripe about the car. The rear seat room is limited for me (6'0"). Now, the headroom is fine, but when I exit the car, I have to wedge my feet out from the floorboard and then sort of lift up my legs to get them out behind the driver's seat, then get out. This may be due, however, to the fact that my dad has the seat back about 45 degrees, but still, the foot room is very limited. Shorter people should be just fine. The other gripe is that the base CE model came with NO TRUNK LIGHT. That can be a hassle, but we work with it. The trunk itself has great capacity. Overall, I give the Interior a 6/10.

EXTERIOR

As I stated before, the car is a bright white. The paint is very well finished, and looks GREAT when clean. The chrome trim around the grille adds extra fanciness. The headlights I absolutely LOVE. I love the roundish and shaping design of the lights and the hood, compared to the '98-'00 models. The rear treatment only involved replacing vertical reverse lights for round ones. I like the round better. The wheels were 14" aluminum. However, "rash" seems to easily create on these. The car also loves to attract tar and other road debris on the bottom portion of the car. Also, the black molding and door handles slightly take away from the cars sharpness. Overall, I rate the exterior a 8/10. 

PERFORMANCE

The engine is a 1.8 I4 VVTi (Variable Valve Timing w/Intelligence). Our old Camry had a 2.0. The Corolla definitely has more pep and speed than the old Camry. Not to mention, handling is great since it is lighter in weight. I love cruising in this car. Gas mileage is also great. We achieve about 35MPG. The 3-Speed Automatic Transmission, since it doesn't have overdrive, makes the car sound slightly higher pitched, and could comprise gas mileage slightly. The car is smooth riding and decently quiet, but not as quiet as my mom's Camry. Overall, I rate the performance an 8/10. 

RELIABILITY

One line sums it up. After 27,000 miles, NO PROBLEMS. 10/10

PRICE

We decided to purchase the car after the test drive. The dealer sold it to us for $11,900, which was $2,800 off the sticker! It was well worth it.

CONCLUSION

Since our nearly two years of ownership, we highly recommend the Toyota Corolla for smaller cars. The new 2003 model is VERY sharp and features a standard CD player and A/C on all models. The rear seat room is also larger in capacity. The Toyota Corolla is also a very wise used car choice. A '98 model can be had for about $5,000-$6,000. A 2001 model stills runs about $9,000. No matter what kind of vehicle you need, Toyota should be at the top of your list!
