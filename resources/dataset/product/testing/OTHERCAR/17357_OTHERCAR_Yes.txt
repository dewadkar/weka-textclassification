            First driving experience:
As soon as I adjusted my all-electronic adjustable driver's seat (not electronic for passenger-side) to maximum comfort and the power mirrors to correct driver's view, I put the V6 into drive and pulled out of the dealer's lot. The 200hp engine kicks at first until you get adjusted to applying the right pressure on the pedal. As the engine shifts from 1st to 2nd gear, there is a slight lag for the engine to catch, but not so bad that I would call it annoying. Leg room was ample for me, but then I'm only 5'5"! My cousin in the back had no complaints however. The AM/FM CD radio was easily accessible even while driving, and the speaker system is adequate, but not exceptional. Handling was superb, as the Accord grips the road around corners. On the highway, at higher speeds there was no problem with acceleration, as it was smooth. I've read about complaints of cabin noise, but I found none.

Quality, Features, and Options:
Unfortunately, due to a lack of Accord LX V6's at my local dealer, I was unable to get the color I wanted (silver or Black), but had to settle for Naples Gold (or pay extra for having another one brought over from elsewhere).  Luckily, the gold wasn't bad. The dealer did agree to my price of $20,242 which includes destination charge (the avg. $$ people are paying around the country), so I was very happy about that, considering it was the start of the summer! (Try buying in the Winter - better prices) I did pay extra ($495) for keyless entry/passive alarm as this does not come standard on the LX (only the EX), but for city living it's a must! Trunk room is more than adequate, however the back seat was cramped for 3 slightly chubby people (sorry!). The ABS breaks work like a charm, as does the A/C, cruise-control, power windows and door-locks. I find the front console to be unimaginative, but status quo, perfect for what I wanted. The only other extra I would've wanted to add were the alloy rims, but I could do a lot with $1000! The hubcaps are a newer style, and looked fine. I recently had someone park right up to my bumper, and tap my car. This left some paint chipping and scratches which did decrease the overall look of the car (black showed through underneath). So, if you can, try and avoid tapping your bumpers against anything, as the paint chips easily. (Note: I was able to purchase Naples Gold touch-up paint online, and am currently waiting to receive it) 

Overall Opinion and Recommendation:
The Honda Accord LX V6 automatic sedan is just what I needed and wanted living in New York City, and surviving on a tight budget. I know that I could've done better at $25,000 or higher, but for me my gold Accord gets me around town safely, and didn't break my bank.
