            I rented a Mazda Protege for a weekend - and proceeded to drive it over 1,700 miles.  Yes, really.  I started out near Philadelphia, went north to I-80, and west to my in-laws' in Chicago, where my wife had been visiting.  The next day, we went to a rock concert outside the city, with a friend and her brother.  And the day after that, I drove from Chicago back to the Philadelphia area with my wife.

A little more extreme than your average test drive, to be sure.  But the Protege handled it pretty well.  I-80 through northern Pennsylvania is a fast, hilly road with sweeping curves and tons of scenery.  I tried to &quot;go with the flow&quot; - which meant logging a few hundred miles at speeds of between 75 and 100(!) miles per hour... while getting passed by faster drivers from time to time!  The rolling terrain of the midwest went by slower, partly due to construction.

The Protege's punch ran out a little bit on the longer uphills, and on the way home with my wife, things were definitely slower - and not just because she kept looking at the speedometer!  The engine has enough power to haul the car and one passenger pretty quickly; add passengers and cargo and things don't go quite so fast.

Throughout the trip, though, the Protege got pretty good mileage, even at high(way) speeds, for a range of 300 miles or more on a tank of gas.  This was a plus, since gas prices in Ohio and Illinois are notoriously high, while prices in Indiana and Pennsylvania are a bit lower.<br><br>
