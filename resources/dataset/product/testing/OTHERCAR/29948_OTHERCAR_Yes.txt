            After having our first child, it was time for us to return our leased SUV. Fighting against it, my husband and I decided that by the time we were ready for a new car it was quite possible that we've have more kids. We decided on purchasing a minivan. After doing a lot of research and visiting almost every other major dealership, we decided to purchase the 2000 Dodge Grand Caravan SE in silver fern metallic. 
This minivan has many pluses. First of which is the room. It is very roomy; seating a comfortable seven, including our son's carseat and his stroller in the storage area. There is room to move around and the seating is very comfortable. We opted for a bench seat because its easier to enter the rear seating with the car seat installed. Because I am always hot and my husband is always cold, we love the dual air/heating system and the rear vents and controller for the air/heating system. 
The pickup is also very good; this engine has a lot more power than my suv did. We also love the dual sliding doors, which make loading and unloading our son very easy. The body style is very attractive as well. All in all we are very pleased with our choice. 
The only downside was that several other models offered more reasonably priced or free entertainment systems, however, because of the good price we paid, we feel we can add one in the future. We did add the remote keyless entry/alarm and remote start and it is well worth it when loading and unloading a child. The only other bad thing I can say is that I found it unusual that a minivan wouldn't come with tether anchors for carseats already installed, as cars do. But, I must give Dodge credit for installing them quickly and at no charge to us. <br><br>
