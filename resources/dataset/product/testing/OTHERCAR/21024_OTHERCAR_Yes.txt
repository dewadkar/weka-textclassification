            I purchased my DSC-P5 from Dell.com, about two months ago, and I absolutely love it! If you want to see a camera that looks as good as the pictures it takes, then you've got to check out the Sony DSC-P5! This little camera is stunning!

The Sony DSC-P5 is super small, with a silvery hard metal body that's not much longer than a business card. This camera is so tiny that it can easily fit into any shirt pocket, with room to spare for an extra memory stick! But don't let its small size fool you into thinking it lacks advanced features, because the DSC-P5 packs a powerful punch. 

For starters, the DSC-P5 features 3.2 mega pixels, 6x zoom lens, a bright LCD display, self-timer, built-in flash, and up to 2400 x 1538 resolution. Although the DSC-P5 is primarily designed to be a point and shoot camera, its flexible settings will probably be sufficient to satisfy more advanced users.

The DSC-P5's controls are located on the camera's back panel. This is where the 1.5 inch color LCD monitor resides. The LCD monitor lets you preview and play back images, and there is a small black-and-white information display directly above it. The information display shows your current camera and exposure settings. 

The camera's zoom control is in the upper right corner, located above the thumb grip. And in the center of the back panel is a four-way Arrow Pad, with four small arrows pointing in opposite directions (Up, Down, Left, and Right). The arrow pad allows you to navigate through on-screen menus and to select different camera functions (Flash, Self-Timer, Review, and Macro).

The DSC-P5 lets you save your photos in a wide variety of sizes and resolutions. This is a handy feature for those of you wanting to upload your photos to the web, send photos via email, or print them using Kodak's photo paper for inkjet printers. You can resize the images to 2,048 x 1,536-, 1,600 x 1,200-, 1,280 x 960-, or 640 x 480-pixels.

Despite its advanced features, this little camera is almost foolproof for those of us who need lots of help! I knew next to nothing about digital photography before getting this camera, but my first picture, using the camera straight out of the box, was picture PERFECT!

One thing that I really like about this little camera is its ability to take excellent indoor mugshots and crystal clear night scenes. With all my previous cameras, I have typically been very disappointed with pictures taken indoors or at night. They would usually come out too dark and with a dull, lifeless tone. That has not been the case with the Sony DSC-P5. 

The DSC-P5 is magic! I mean, you don't have to make any manual adjustments for low-light conditions...unless, of course, you just want to experiment. Indoor pictures are always light and bright with this camera, and I am really amazed at the clarity and quality of night scenes. They're spectacular.

Moreover, the colors are so vivid and bright. Reds are really red, blues are crisp and vibrant, and skin tones are true to life. The pictures this camera takes are amazingly sharp and colorful.

I recently took a photo of my sister-in-law's brown weenie dog, named Little Ann. Well, Little Ann was hiding under a bright fuchsia colored towel, and all you could see was her large brown snout and two big floppy ears. After a moment or two, she popped her head out, and I seized the moment to take a quick snapshot.

Let me tell you, my DSC-P5 made this shot a keeper and turned it into a real conversation piece! Everyone who sees this photo says it looks like a store-bought postcard! The colors are so real that it looks as if you can actually pet Little Ann's fur. The bright fuchsia towel was shockingly vibrant against her fur, and her little nose looks as wet as glass. Hey, this picture makes me look like a pro!

When taking indoor photos, however, I do recommend that you use a tripod, if at all possible, because the DSC-P5 is very sensitive to movement; and unless you have a very steady hand, then you will likely end up with one or two blurry photos for every eight or ten shots that you take...and they just might be your favorites. So purchase a tripod if your budget allows!

One thing I don't like about this camera, however, is the short battery life. Sony says the InfoLITHIUM battery holds a charge for up to 90 minutes, but I've discovered that completely draining the battery before a full recharge gives me 100 minutes of battery power. So far, I haven't faced the problem of having the the charge run out during a photo shoot, but I do feel a bit "rushed" knowing the clock is ticking so fast. 

In any case, I highly recommend the Sony DSC-P5. It's one of the best compact, high-resolutions digicams available for less than $600.00!
