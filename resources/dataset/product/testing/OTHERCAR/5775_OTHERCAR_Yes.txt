            The Olympus D490 camera is worth your wait. I have been watching the market, waiting for the digital camera that would take high quality photos and would be balanced as a camera. I have broken the plusses and minuses of the review below for your reading ease

Plusses + Size (At first I was almost dissapointed that the camera was so small. I have been used to seeing digital cameras that were huge and unweildy. The D490 Actually is the same size as film using relatives in the Olympus family. If you use the optical viewfinder instead of the LCD screen, most people wont have a clue that you even are using a digital camera)

+ Ease of use (The D490 is very easy to use. The included software makes downloading the images easy, and the camera operates like any other regular camera.)

+ Pictures (The pictures are beautiful. They are huge and vivid.)

+ Speed (The camera uses a RAM buffer to store the images temporarily as they are written to the EEPROM Chip. What this means is that you are able to take multiple photos while the camera is writing the pictures to memory. This is a marked advantage over the D460, and is discussed in another user's review)

+ Reliability (I've had it a few months, never had a problem yet.)

+ Movies! (This camera takes 15 second high quality movies! It also has an option to take low quality 60 second movies, however since the high quality movies only have a resolution of 320 by 240, the low quality ones really are worthless... for reference i think they are 160 by 120)

Minuses

- Software problems (I think it may just be the software i got since i havent heard anyone else complain in this area, but my camedia software cannot splice together the panoramic shots.... oh well... i didnt buy the camera solely for this purpose so it doesnt bother me so much)

- Movies dont have sound

- Lack of USB connectivity (This feature is a must these days, and although i did get a Viking USB card reader, it would have been a great feature to add one into the camera to begin with)

Overall i think this camera is GREAT. Digital cameras are still a bit pricey for most people, and really the consumer is still paying a hefty chunk of the R+D costs instead of the manufacturing costs, however when a company produces such a high quality product such as this one, i dont really mind it.

If you want a digital camera buy this one.
