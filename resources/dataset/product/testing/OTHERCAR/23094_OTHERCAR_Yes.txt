            I bought this camera from Walmart on 12/05/99/...It was on sale and very well priced..I paid 105.00.  The camera included the software, cables, 4 batteries, case, memory.  I was very suprised that even the batterises came w/ it..what a suprise.

The reason I bought it was because I have alot of crazy friends that are tons of fun at parties and and normally I go through 4-5 rolls of film per month.  so the cost of developing is very high, not to mention not all picturs come out exactlly as you would expect due to low lighting, movment..ect..ect..

Now, not only can I preview the picturs, but I can download them to computer or VCR..In best mode it hols 12 pictures, but in medium best mode, it holds 36...All my friends have computers, so I download then retake more..Its tons of fun and very easy..I would be lost with out it now..And now that the holidays are comming. I cna take millions of picturs knowing I no longer have to rush to the drugstore to develope them..It already has paid for it self as on average it cost's about 7.00 to develope 24 pictures, not including copies, enlargements...No you can make as many copies and easily email them or send in a card...

Also for people that might have poor eyesight. might benifit from this camera as they cam easily view them on a computer screen or TV..i have already transfered like 200 photos to a VCR tape. and now my parents don't have to strain their eyes as the pictures fill up the whole screen..I never imagined I would so good enlarged on a 25&quot; TV..

It comes with a 2 meg memory card..however for about 60.00 you can get a 16 meg card which will hold up to 1-2 week opf vacation pictures..

I chose this product becasue of the price..Fuji digital camera has the same exact  specfication and they wanted 178.00..Thats crazy, well worth the price, but I much would rather save the 72.00..An Polaroid is a very well know camera as it their film so who could go wrong.

Its very easy..point, shoot, preview, save or delete..VCR is so easy...pug it in to video in jack, then preview..what coul;d be easier ??

Compuer transfer is much better as the software makes it a breeze and comes with pretty cool stuff for multimedia postcards, frames..ect..ect..

I have had alot of bad lich w/ buying stuff for the computer, but next to getting my computer, this is the best investment I think I have ever made..<br><br>
