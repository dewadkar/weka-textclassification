 Well last year when I found out I was pregnant I realized that it was time to get rid of my pick-up truck and get something more like a family car. I didn't have much money to spend , so I was looking at used cars. I came across a 95 Grand Am and wasn't too sure about. I mean at the time it just wasn't what I was looking for so I kept looking. Well after awhile I realized that for the little money I had the Grand Am was the best choice! Now I am very happy I decided on it. It has great pick up. It is only a 4 cylinder and I am use to a 6 but I really can't tell the difference. The trunk has tons of space. And you need that with a baby. Most cars the stroller would take up most of it but not this car. Shortly after my son was born I took a trip to Mrytle Beach with some of my family and could fit all my sons stuff, my stuff, and some of my families. This is my first child so you know I had to take everything! I have only had to take it into the shop once and that was cause the check oil light would always be on. Once that was fixed I haven't had any problems with it.  It does great on gas. I fill it up and I am good to go for the week , And I am always on the road. I would reccomend this car to anyone that wants a family car with a little sport to it!<br><br>
