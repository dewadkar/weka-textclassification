            I saw this car on a Toyota used car lot.  I had never even heard of it.  I was just THINKING about buying a car.  I told a friend of mine that I wanted to buy a smaller car.  I was driving a Chevy Caprice and unintentionally barrelling over whatever happened to be close by.  She had a Toyota and suggested that we go by there to look at some used Toyotas.  We looked at several and most of them were either to high for my price range or had way to many miles on them.

I saw the Mazda and asked to take it for a test drive.  It had low miles and was even still under warranty.  It was also in my price range.  I was really impressed with the way it drove and the interior (cloth seats - no more vinyl sticking to my legs!). I decided to buy the car and I drove it off the lot the next day.

That would have to be my biggest impulsive buying ever.  I will never buy a car on impulse again even though I have never regretted my decision to buy this car.  (I just think it was a not bright to spend so much money impulsively.)

I like this car for several reasons.  It is small and easy to drive anywhere.  It gets pretty good gas mileage. But most of all, it is very comfortable.  I have even slept in the front and back seats on a road trip.  It is surprisingly roomy for its size, and almost everyone who rides in it with me remarks on that as well.

The Protoge I have has automatic shoulder harnesses.  I like this feature but often I forget to undo the lap belt while exiting the car.  This can be embarrassing! It is also hard to get passengers to wear their lap belt as it is &quot;too much trouble&quot; and looks like they are wearing seat belts to passing cop cars.  

I will drive this car until it dies and will definitely look into buying another Mazda in the future.<br><br>
