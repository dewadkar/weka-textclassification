            My husband and I have owned three Jeeps over the past few years.  We bought our first one in August of 1995.  It was a 2door Cherokee sport.  I loved it!  It rode well, it was comfortable and roomy and was great on gas mileage.  Not to mention the peace of mind having a 4 wheel drive.  After we had our first baby, the 2 door was too small for us so we upgraded to a Grand Cherokee in 1998.  This vehicle is absolutely amazing!  It is as comfortable as a car, has the room of a van and has the towing and 4 wheel drive qualities of a truck.  What more could someone want in a car?  We now have two children and a full grown collie.  We do alot of traveling from North Carolina to Alabama and our Jeep is perfect.  We have room for everyone and all of the luggage that goes with a family of four!  Not to mention that it is comfortable to drive and ride in and gets good gas mileage.  My husband had a 1980 CJ7 a couple of years ago.  It was his fun car.  He went four-wheeling and exploring back roads in it as well as towed his boat and went fishing.  He loved it.  He felt that it was one of the best vehicles he'd ever owned.  We lived in Missouri and it was better than any other car in the snow and ice.  We had to sell it when our children were born because it wasn't big enough for all of us anymore, but, someday he's going to get another one.  I recommend Jeep to anyone who wants a good reliable vehicle.  They are a little expensive but they are worth their weight in gold!  A Jeep will run forever if the owner makes sure that it has all of it's preventive maintenance done regularly.  Take care of it and it will take care of you and family! <br><br>
