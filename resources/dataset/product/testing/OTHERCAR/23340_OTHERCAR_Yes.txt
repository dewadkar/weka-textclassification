            You have to love the design of the 3rd generation Rx7, there is no comparison.  Performance! Unbeatable in it's price class and well above.

The Rx7 is a true driving experience for those who drive, as opposed to point an automobile. The incredible acceleration will leave your head spinning and the superb handling will put G forces on your cranium that are usually reserved for F16 jockies. But all this comes with a high price tag.

Aside from the high purchase price, $50k in Canada (before taxes), maintenance and up keep can be crippling. 

I purchased a 94 Rx7 Touring model, used in Oct. 94.  The car had originally been purchased as a fiftieth birthday present for a local lady.
When I purchased it, it only had 7000 miles on the odometer.  Fortunately it came with a transferable extended warranty.

The biggest factor in buying the car was male testosterone as opposed to common sense, what a rush!!!!!!  When I checked out the car, there appeared to be a small and insignificant exhaust leak somewhere around the manifold, cost to repair (under warranty) $8600.00.  During two years of ownership, over $38,000 in warranty work was carried out on this vehicle.  Thank goodness I paid the money to have the extended warranty transfered.  The break down goes something like this:

Small exhaust leak.....replace warped turbo unit...........$8,600.00
Loss of power..........plugged cat converter...............$3,000.00
Loss of power..........replace turbo unit 2nd one defective$8,600.00
poor performance.......change all ignition wiring..........$  900.00
Loss of power..........replace both cat converters.........$6,000.00
Lack of power..........replace engine......................$11,000.00

All of the above where on going related problems. One of the cat converters had plugged causing heat build up through the turbo unit causing the manifold and turbines to warp.  When the turbo unit was initially replaced, no one took the time to analyse what had caused the problem, hence, new turbo unit with old plugged cat converter.  The converter was replaced within a week of the turbo unit, too late, damage was already done to the new turbos. 

The cat converters could not take the intense heat the rotary generates when being driven hard for sustained periods of time, consequently I fried another two converters, which eventually effected the engine. All this occurred over two years and 60,000 miles.

High performance comes at a staggering price tag so this is definitely a second or third car relationship, don't depend on it as primary transportation unless you can afford to be without it for weeks at atime.

I spent 1.5 hours on Road America chasing a 911 Turbo, the ride was definitely worth the cost; a complete set of tires, $2,000.00; Two cat converters, $6,000.00.

With all that said and done, the car was the best driving experience of any &quot;street&quot; machine I have ever owned (including a 911 Porsche). 

A REAL WEENIE PLEASER!!!!!!! <br><br>
