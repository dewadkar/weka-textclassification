            I recently bought my wife a 2000 Neon and she love the little car. She was against it at first but when she got in it and started to drive it she feel in love with it instantly. She love the handling and all of the sharp styling it has to offer. The stereo system(am-fm radio cassette and cd with multi changer) that came factory is a real nice touch that she also fell in love with on her new Neon. She likes it so much that she never lets me drive it. They really made a  lot of nice improvements  with it this year. The 2.0 engine is a lot of power for the small engine it is and has no problem getting up to speed when entering tight freeway traffic. Thanks Plymouth.<br><br>
