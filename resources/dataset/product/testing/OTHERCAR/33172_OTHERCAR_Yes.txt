            I just had to write a tribute to my car, a 1997 Honda Accord Coupe. Now, I'm not exactly what you'd call &quot;A Good Driver&quot;, in fact the previous two cars I've owned have both ended up upside down in an intersection and a ditch respectively. But my Honda will not give up. It's been broken into twice (which I don't blame on the car, but my bad luck with property), I ran into the back of another car once, backed into a tree with the door open, breaking the door, I have dents, scratches, I've bottomed out more times then I can count, and narrowly avoided several accidents..... Anyway, the bottom line is I'm not a very good driver. The topper came last night when I somehow managed to drive into a wall of rocks, disengaging the airbags, breaking out a light and knocking my bumper loose. I say this all to prove a point. For all the damage I have done to my car, and the way I've been driving it, I have never had a single problem with the car running. For all the chaos, the car still runs beautifully, unlike my last car, a Ford Taurus, I only put the Taurus through half as much grief before it met it's final curtains and It seemed like I was taking that thing into the shop every month to get something inside fixed. and it was only 2 years older. So the bottom line is, if the only reason you retain a driver's license is because the police only know about 1/100th of the traffic violations you committed, if everytime you step out on the road, You pray to God that you don't kill anyone, This is the car for you.
