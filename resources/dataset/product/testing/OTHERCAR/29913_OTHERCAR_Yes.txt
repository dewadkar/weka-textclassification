            We purchased a 1995 Pontiac Sunfire brand new - the transmission went out at 40,000 miles - the car was always serviced on a regular basis.  My father has the identical car and it has problems with the passenger side door sticking in cold weather as does mine.  The car has had several manufacture recalls - one being the head gasket - my father's went out on his car and he had it replaced free of charge by the dealer - they are warrantying this for 100K miles.  I haven't had any other repairs on my Sunfire - but normal maintenance, i.e. new tires, brakes, etc.  Dealers are now saying they make no money selling cars - only if the consumer allows them to do maintenance on your vehicle after purchase.  I was offered no help in the repair of my transmission - the shop that I took it too said it had been going out for quite a while - faulty pump in the transmission - most consumer groups say not to purchase the extended warranty on a vehicle as the majority of problems will show up in the first year - I still believe this - but thought the dealer would take into consideration that we have other Pontiac vehicles and we were loyal customers - they consider loyalty now if you have it serviced by Pontiac only - not how many you own.<br><br>
