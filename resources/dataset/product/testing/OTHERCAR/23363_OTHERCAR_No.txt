                 Having narrowed my search down for a new SUV to two, I was very much looking forward to seeing what the M Class had to offer.  At first blush, I was very excited.  The exterior is attractive and the lines are really cool.  I was particularly taken by the Cobalt Blue color.  I found the interior roomy and comfortable.  Of course, the vehicle that we test drove was a &quot;loaded&quot; 320.
     I was surprised to find that climate control was not an option.  The salesman said that it was a cost cutting measure, but when you consider that you're already paying upwards of $40,000, what's a little more to get a feature that you think of as standard in a luxury Sport Ute.  The drive was what disappointed me most.  The car lacked pickup, particularly when getting onto the highway.  It was also louder than I expected from Mercedes. 
     Overall, I was unimpressed with the 320.  Perhaps the 430 does better, but one was not available to test drive.  Considering the fact that it's essentially the same car with a bigger engine and a few more bells and whistles (nav system, etc), I think that I'll be taking the M Class off my list of possibles.
