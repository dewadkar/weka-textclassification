                      I have owned my 2001 Eclipse GT for one week and so far it kicks. First off im 16 so it may be a different review from a 40 year old. But the first thing I want to talk about is the performance it is amazing  it pulls a 0-60 in 7.3 (with auto trans/sporttronic shifter) the new V-6 205hp in my mind is nicer then the older gs-t turbos which i have heard has some problems, It also comes with 17 inch aloy wheels, 4 wheel disc brakes, and keyless entry, I got mine with the premium package which comes with 4 disc infinity cd player, 4 wheel ABS, 7 speaker system (220 watts) it sounds so good, my dad owns a 2000 Nissan Pathfinder with the Bose system and I think it sound alot nicer then that and that one kicks A@#,also power sunroof, trac control, leather seats, and 4 air bags.  The one thing I got beef with is the &quot;SMALL&quot; back seat and I meen small but what should you expect from a hatchback and that is the one and only reson i gave it four stars. Some people don't like the new styling but I love it I Have ridin in alot of small hatchback and with out a doubt it is the nicest. I Would recommend this car for a kid 16-25 or a fun seeking adult but over all I am not at all upset with my investment in any way.                            <br><br>
