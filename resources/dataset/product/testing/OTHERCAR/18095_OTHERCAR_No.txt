            I have a 96 Neon, from the first day when I drove my car off the lot with 12 miles all I have had is problems.The window would not roll up. The car makes all sorts of noises.I am always bringing it to the shop.I always had problems with the brakes.They squeak all the time which I have been told by several car mechanics that Neons are known for having brakes that squeak.Even Chrysler dealers told me that,after I purchased my car.I have had to have new front &amp; back brakes put on. It does not drive smooth. The radio just went out. There are so many other little things that have gone wrong. A co-worker of mine has had the same problems with her car..Usually her problems happen first then it will happen to my car so at least I will know what is going to break next!! The anti-freeze leaked out and my car overheated...Now the oil leaks. I went to have it looked at and my head gasket needs to be replaced...GUESS HOW MUCH IT WILL COST??? $1500.00!I just sent in my last car payment last week! I HATE my car and I try to tell everyone I know to NOT buy a NEON!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE DO THE SAME!!!!!!! Also please refer to this web site if you want to see how other individuals are having the same problems as I am.
