            You read review after review of these cars and you would get the impression that Honda can do no wrong when it comes to building bullet-proof cars.

My family and friends have had quite alternative experience with the Honda products we have owned since 1978.

First, and universal in our experiences:  The Automatic transmissions are just plain inferior, even by domestic standards. Out of the following:  1978 Accord, 1981 Accord, 1988 Civic, 1990 Civic, 1990 Accord, and 1997 Civic, NOT ONE OF THESE made the 100,000 mile mark without requiring EXPENSIVE overhauling of their automatic transmissions.  

You'll notice that this spans 20 model years!  Don't believe the crap you hear that they've improved.  Since I banished Honda from our family, I still hear from friends driving 95-03 Honda and Acura products that at least half of them are encountering automatic transmission problems at as early as 60,000 Miles.

Mechanically they are ok otherwise, but honestly, from what I've experienced, observed, and heard from others, in this class of automobile, a far superior alternative, if you must have automatic transmission, is the Toyota Corolla, an almost 100% bullet-proof little car.

If you must have a Honda, I strongly recommend passing on the automatic option and going with their excellent 5-speed manual, which IS a superb unit, and with careful driving will last the life of the car, (other than clutch pad replacements).

I now add comments specific to the 97 civic coupe that I drove.

The Pros:  Light, nimble & quick;

The Cons:  Gas mileage;
           Cross-winds would blow it all over the road;
           Seats not supportive;
           Very unstable handling on canyon roads;
           Structurally flimsy - a cheap tin can!

The Pros:  Because the car weighs just over one ton, and rides on a very short wheelbase, it can dart in and out of tight spaces. But there's a price to pay . . . 

The Cons:  Gas mileage - the worst of any Honda I ever owned.  Average city about 16mpg and Average freeway about 22mpg.  Average overall about 18mpg.  I complained about this to the Honda dealer.  They assured me, having just serviced the car, that everything was as it should be, and maybe I just had a lead foot.  When I told them I got better mpg from a heavier Accord, they blew me off.  I called American Honda in Gardena and had precisely the same experience as with the dealer.  Gardena had the nerve to tell me that mpg was down because the '97 models weighed more than the '92's.  I checked on this and found out that my '97 was actually LIGHTER than my '92 which had been a four-door sedan.

Cross winds blow it all over the road.  Because of its short stubby stance and aluminum-foil body, this car is strongly affected by vigorous cross winds, to an extent I found alarming at speeds of 65mph.

The seats are not supportive.  In 1999 I was diagnosed with sciatica, a lower back condition.  My chiropractor showed me an index of auto manufacturers rated by how well their seats conformed to lower-back support.  Interestingly, Honda's ranking was worse than several Korean makes.

The car handles ok in a straight line and on gentle curves.  When taking it through a canyon, the oversteer created by front-wheel-drive is aggravated by the short wheel-base and for the kind of con-brio driving I take for granted with my Volvo, the Honda was woefully unable to keep up.

The car is structurally unsound.  The anti-Volvo if you will.  With less than 27,000 miles I got rid of it after being presented with $4,500.00 in body and mechanical expenses to repair damage done when I rear-ended a '94 Nissan Sentra at about 8mph.  This was not severe enough to trigger the air-bags, but the front end of the car was destroyed.  The radiator ripped apart, the car not drivable, and the damage went all the way to the O2 sensor, a $450.00 replacement at the dealer.  Thoroughly disgusting. (As a direct in-family comparison, our '87 Volvo 740 rear-ended another car a few months after the accident in the Honda.  My son believed the speed of collision to be around 10mph, but the difference was first the Volvo was drivable from the scene, and second, the TOTAL repair bill at the same body shop was only $500.00!

In specific the Honda Civic has little to recommend it over alternatives with sturdier body structures and more durable mechanicals.  The seats are less comfortable than those in the Toyota Corolla or the Ford Escort, but I liked them better than those in the Nissan Sentra.

If it weren't for the Honda badging on the steering wheel, I would be hard-pressed to tell you from what manufacturer the Civic came;  IT'S SO DAMN GENERIC!  The rear seats do fold down, which is handy for carrying larger objects than the tiny back area will take.  Overall interior layout is Generic Front Drive Econobox, with materials that feel and look just like those in other cars in its class.

Above I commented about areas that are relevant to me as a driver, specifically, how well the vehicle does its job of getting me from place to place with minimal drama, and maximal safety, while not punishing me by developing a sudden Achilles heel like a transmission failing at 70,000 miles, or the car becoming a candidate for insurance 
"total loss" after an 8mph "fender bender".

I hope that I have been specific and articulate enough to be understood by the reader to give the 1997 Civic failing
marks in some of the most crucial areas that an objective party would evaluate an automobile, ESPECIALLY one who's entire marketing and public relations stresses excellence in engineering and design, as does Honda's.

I certainly can't be the only one to have had this kind of experience with a Honda product.  How they keep this high perception among the public is a total mystery. Am I an abusive owner?  With 180,000 more-or-less trouble-free miles on a '94 Volvo, I DON'T THINK SO.
