            I was looking for an SUV, my frist choice was a Four runner, But I found Montero sports more attractive in terms of price and look. When I started driving I never regretted my decision. This is an amazing vehicle, which could make anyone proud of their car.

The Only thing makes me feel little uncomfortable is it's inability to take quick turns, as this is common to all SUVs, I am ok with that.

Driving this car is making me feel secured and as if having lots of power and control.

This vehicle is good for people who like SUVs. This is one of the best SUVs in the market. May not be suitable for as a family cars.<br><br>
