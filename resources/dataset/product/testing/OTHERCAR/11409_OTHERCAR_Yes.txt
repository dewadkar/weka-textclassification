            After nearly three years of renting various SUV's - Ford Explorers, Blazers, Jimmys, Broncos, Bravados, and Dodge Durangos - and experience driving Jeep Grand Cherokees, Ford Expeditions, and others, my wife and I finally purchased an SUV several months ago.  Our choice? A 2000 4WD SR5 Toyota 4Runner.

This vehicle is everything the reviews would lead you to believe.  It is a well-engineered, cleanly designed machine that exudes rock-solid reliability wherever you look.  The doors close like a bank vault. The ride is a bit stiff, but surprisingly comfortable.  The vehicle's cornering ability is also surprisingly good for an SUV that is the leader of its class in ground clearance.  It's gas mileage is also surprisingly good at 18 mpg for city driving and nearly 21 mpg on the highway.

The 183 horsepower, 6-cylinder powerplant has been variously criticized as being somehow less than adquate, but I have not found that to be the case.  This efficient six is more than up to the task - whether you are pulling a twenty-four foot boat out of a slick, steep boat ramp or working your way across the Dragon in the Smokies...

The interior of the vehicle is especially well-appointed.  There's no nonsense here, mind you.  Everything is just ergonomically well laid out.  From windshield wiper, washer, radio, cd player, lights, door locks to gas tank release lever, the controls are all where you would intuitively expect them to be.  The 4Runner is a vehicle that will fit you like a glove when you first climb into the comfortable and adjustable seats. The high end sound system gets rave reviews from everyone.  And the ample cargo area has plenty of room for all your expeditionary needs. With the addition of the optional roof rack and cargo box, you will have all the storage you need.

Most folks purchase an SUV with no intention of ever visiting the back country, but that's not the case with me.  This vehicle will be my ticket to many fly fishing adventures in the North Carolina and Tennessee wild country; and I have every expectation that it will get me there with class and, most importantly, reliability.

And, in the final analysis, though there may be faster, bigger, less expensive (and more expensive), not to mention prettier SUV's on the market these days, I suspect there is no more reliable total SUV package than the 4Runner...

For anyone contemplating the purchase of an SUV, the Toyota 4Runner HAS THIS DRIVER'S UNQUALIFIED ENDORSEMENT...
