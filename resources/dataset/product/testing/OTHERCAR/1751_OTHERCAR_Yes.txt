            In short, I love my 1995 Mazda 626 LX V6. :)  We purchased it used about a year ago after our lease on our 1997 Nissan Altima GXE expired.  It had about 62K on it (automatic).  The dealer put on new tires and added new breaks as well.  We also took it to Mazda after we bought it and got all new plugs, etc. (smart move as it increased the horsepower by 20% or more!).

This car is a screamer.... I think I read the V6 has 164 horsepower and man it's quick.  I've sort of been looking for a new car lately but often walk away from the dealership happy to have my faithful 626.  The engine shifts extremely smoothly and gets OK mileage around town.  We haven't used it in the snow so I can't comment on that.  One annoying thing is that the front end does tend to scrape the pavement sometimes when pulling out of a sloped parking lot, etc.  Also, our right-hand blinker blinks at that annoying quick pace you see sometimes around town.  

The seats are comfortable and I think the back seats offer a decent amount of room.  Overall, my favorite aspects are this car's speed and acceleration as well as its overall handling.  It's almost too easy driving this car (doesn't feel like you're driving at all).  The only downside I could cite is that the visibility wasn't as good as our old Altima but the driving experience is much better!<br><br>
