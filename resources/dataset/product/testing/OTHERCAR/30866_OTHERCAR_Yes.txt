            Without a doubt, the 2000 Suzuki Grand Vitara is the best compact SUV in its class. I bought mine last March after careful review of other models from Subaru, Honda, Toyota, and even KIA. The only model that I even considered besides the G.V. was the Forester, however I was turned away by the price, all wheel drive, and the image (looks too much like a station wagon- a grandpa car). In contrast, the G.V. boasts a shift on the fly 4 wheel drive which has performed exceptionally this winter. The AWD system cannot compare with this feature. Suzuki also offers an affordable price compared to the outrageously priced RAV4 and Honda CRV. 

Interestingly, the literature which critiqued the G.V. often focussed on its tiny stereo buttons and weird name. Give me a break! If that's all auto professional auto reviewers can come up with, then they should start looking for another job. I was very disappointed at the knit picking from some of these so called car consumer guides. Yet, in general, reviewers praised this SUV, but the ones who ranked the Honda and Toyota above make you wonder. The G.V. dominates in nearly all of the specifications. Yes, it is smaller than the CRV, but it can't win in everything. More importantly, take a look underneath the CRV and witness the shabby construction- the axle is about the same size as my pinky. The G.V. is built on a solid truck-like frame which an SUV needs for durability. Which other SUV has this feature....need I say more.<br><br>
