            I bought this camera for a few reasons.  First of all I had always wanted a digital camera so I did not have to worry about film or taking bad pictures (you can just delete them).  Secondly, I did a lot of research and I finally chose this camera because of the price and it's features.  I had a low budget but wanted a camera with everything.  This was the best I could get for a camera under $400.  I bought mine with rechargeable batteries and a charger for $375.
   
The Olympus d-460 is one of the best cameras I found for under 400 dollars.  It has so many features.  One of my favorite features is macro.  A camera with macro has the capability of taking pictures of small things from a very close  distance.  I have taken many pictures of dragonflies and other small animals, all of the pictures have come out beautifully.  The manufacturer says the closest you can get is 8 inches but if you zoom in one the object you can make it appear much closer.  Another nice feature is the red eye reduction flash mode which works great.  I also thoroughly enjoy using the LCD screen on the back of the camera.  It is great when you are taking pictures of friends and family and you want to show them the picture if there is not a computer available.  Not only can you view the pictures on the LCD, you can digitally zoom in on them up to 3x, you can move the view up down left or right to center the zoomed picture, you can delete pictures and you can use the LCD as the viewfinder.  However when you use the LCD the batteries do run out much faster.
    
There were a few things that did not completely satisfy me however.  The main one was the rapid shot feature.  This feature was the one of the sole purposes I chose this camera.  But, the rapid shot is not so rapid.  When I was taking pictures of my friends skateboarding it caught the beginning and the end of the trick, that is it.  It is very slow, it seems to be about 1 frame per second.  Another thing I did not like was how fast the batteries wore out when you used the LCD.  I would highly recommend buying some rechargeable batteries and a recharger.  The construction of the camera feels pretty solid but it is all plastic so I am always afraid that if you were to mishandle it, it may break.  The overall feel of holding the camera in your hand is not extremely comfortable due to its compact size.  Lastly, there are so many features it takes a while to learn how to use them all, but the camera does come with a very helpful and detailed manual which will help you learn how to use all of the features.
