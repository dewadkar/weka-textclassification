            I purchased my LS400 in 1990, in the first model year and I still have it and it runs and looks like a new car.  The body and paint have held up exceptionally well, and the interior has maintained its comfort and appearance.  Although it hardly handles like a sports car, it has plenty of power and is very comfortable for long trips.  The only negatives are very expensive services, especially the major ones, like 60,000 and 90,000 miles, and a repeated problem with battery life.  I think Toyota has done a wonderful job of developing a new product and supporting it, and by not introducing radical design changes over the course of a decade, they have helped owners of older models maintain their value.  And if your dealership is anything like mine (Lexus of Greenwich, Connecticut) you can expect very courteous and capable service, including picking up your car and providing a loaner for any maintenance, including routine oil changes.<br><br>
