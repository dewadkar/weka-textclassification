            What a great family car.  I bought this car 3 years ago and I am so glad I did!!!!  

The car is very roomy for a family of four but I have also had five adults in the car for a hour travel and there were not complaints.
The car is easy to maintain, nice on gas mileage. My children really love the rear seat it has an arm rest that comes down so they can &quot;relax&quot; while I drive.  The seatbelts in the rear are shoulder belts.  

There a release in the car for the trunk and for the gas cap door.  There is also a release in the trunk for the gas cap door.  Nice so that no can borrow your gas.  :)   The trunk is roomy, the back seats can come down so you can add more room just incase you need to have it.   We put my tread mill in it so there is enough room.

This is our vacation car we go camping every summer.   My husband loads the car with all sorts of stuff in the trunk and on the roof.   The ride is really nice.    I like having the heated mirrors so when it is cold snowy etc. they are always clean.   The driver seat is electric  you can move is in several directions even in the mid back area.

I would recommend this car to anyone that wants a nice family car.

The only problem that I have had in the past year was four recalls but the dealer fixed them and I was also given a rental car to use while they had mine in the shop.
