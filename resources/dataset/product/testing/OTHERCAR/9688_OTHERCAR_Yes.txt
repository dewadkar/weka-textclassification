            When I was looking for a car, I used the following criterion (in order of importance):
1.) gas mileage -- I knew I was going to be travelling
2.) reliability -- I was extremely value conscious
3.) manual transmission -- personal preference
4.) not a lot of extra gadgets -- I didn't want to spend money fixing power locks, windows, A/C (live in northern USA) , etc.
5.) size -- I wanted a smaller car so I could fit in those tiny city parking spaces
6.) fun to drive 

I bought a 94 Mitsubishi Eclipse (4 cylinder, front wheel drive) that was in excellent condition with 74,000 miles for just under $5000 after getting my first full-time job.  I've had the car for 1.5 years now and have not had any mechanical problems after 40,000 miles.  The car has handled extremely well, even under adverse conditions such as snow and ice.  It accelerates well, and overall I find it very fun to drive.  In addition, the car gets great gas mileage (25 miles/gallon) and is very comfortable when travelling on extended road trips.  The factory sound system is pretty good too (I replaced the tape deck). 

The worst thing about owning a Mitsubishi is that I have not found a reliable dealership anywhere.  I've gone to four different dealerships in three different states, and have not found anyplace I feel I can rely on.  They have tried overcharging me and cannot help me with the simplest requests (I have tried ordering a copy of the owner's manual 3 times now without success, for example.)  My only complaint about the car itself is that it can only hold two people comfortably.   

I would highly recommend this car to any of my friends as well as to anyone who does a lot of travelling alone.  I absolutely rely on my car for transportation, and with my limited income, I do not have much money to spend for repairs.  I have taken extremely good care of my car (regular oil changes, scheduled maintenance, etc.), and have not broken down yet.  I don't have a ton of experience with cars, but I hope that this is useful.
