               I hate this car. It feels like I am going to fall out of it when I'm driving.  My husband has driven this car since 1991 and it has had countless problems.  Nothing major, except constant brake problems, but mostly little things one right after another.  Little things add up time after time.  
   Going into the year 2000, it has 173,000 miles on it.  Yes, my husband used to make a lot of long trips to the beach in it. I recommend this car for the first time driver.  It is a dispensable car, and, in my opinion, will be no big loss if in an accident.  It is durable, I'll give it that.  <br><br>
