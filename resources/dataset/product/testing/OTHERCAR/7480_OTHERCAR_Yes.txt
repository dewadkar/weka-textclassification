            I come from a family of Toyota truck lovers.  We have been involved with Toyota pickups since the mid 80's and are to this day.  I want to be clear that we are talking about the standard small pickup also known as a Hi-Lux (betcha didn't know that:)).  I can't really speak for the larger models.  For the money I have never been around a vehicle of greater value.

My first experience was with an 84 version my family purchased in 86.  we drove it until 1993 when it had 160,000 miles on it and then sold it to someone else who may be driving it to this day.  It had the same problem all the 80's Toyota trucks had, rust.  The engine never needed maintenance but the body, in particular the bed, was almost completely rusted out.  Nevertheless, I would have jumped in it and driven without fear to anywhere right up til the day we sold it.

You can imagine what my first new vehicle purchase was.  In the fall of 1991 I bought a new 1991 pickup for about $7000.  The rust problem had apparently been solved and I drove it for 3 years and 66,000 miles before trading it in.  I wish I never had because I'd probably still be driving it, but I was convinced I needed a car.  Oh well, we live and learn.

My other testimonial would be my brother drives an 87 pickup with 110,000 miles on it and still commutes to work in it every day.  It is rusted out and I think it has been banged up a time or two, but it starts every morning and I'd take it off his hands in a heartbeat.  If you aren't looking for the coolest car in the world, but rather one you, your kids and your grandkids can drive, buy a Toyota pickup and relax.  <br><br>
