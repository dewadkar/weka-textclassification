            Recently I went shopping for a new affordable used car for my wife to drive. I looked at several different models, the Civic, Echo and the Focus come to mind. All seemed a little pricey to me. So a friend of mine to me to the Kia dealership, as he had recently purchased a Sportage. At first I was apprehensive, I took a look at the Rio, which was much cheaper than any other new car I had looked at. I took it for a test drive, and buddy, was I hooked! Small, affordable, great gas mileage, and, though it only has 96hp, it still packs some pep. 

I upgraded my Rio to get some nice things, my wife decided to stay with the 5 speed manual, but I added AC, AM/FM stereo CD, rear spoiler, and 14inch alloy rims. All this plus front dual air bags, power steering, very nice floor mats, all for $11,000! I couldn't believe my eyes. And my wife just simply loves this car. 2,000 miles later, not a problem in the world.

There are a few downsides to the car, however. The 5 speed manual transmission is a bit sluggish at times, but does compliment the engine nicely. The rear seat leg room is not much, but with just 2 kids, it is plently. 

All in all, I don't think you can go wrong with this car. Affordable, roomy, and great gas mileage combine to compliment the 10 year/100,000 mile powertrain/transmission warranty, and the 5 year/60,000 basic bumper to bumper. The catch, you also get 5 years/unlimited mileage roadside assistance, which prompted me to not renew my AAA account! This car is perfect transportation, although I wouldn't recommend taking it to your local drag strip!
