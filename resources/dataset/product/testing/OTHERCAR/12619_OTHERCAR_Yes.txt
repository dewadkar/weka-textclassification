            Size does matter.
 My Wife takes this camera along everywhere.
Her old 35mm SLR is often left at home in bag. 
Takes great pictures with good software to boot. 360 Quicktime VR stuff is really neat.
 
Strengths:  
  Size, Stick it in your pocket. GREAT Pictures. 2+MegaPix Heavy Duty. This camera can take a beating and keep kick'in. 
QUICK. Takes pictures instantly. Auto Lens Cap is simple and easy. Full auto mode takes great pics but still have ability to adjust exposure or use various AE programs for night/etc. Easy interface, Easy buttons, logical icons, etc. (Oylmpus take note and simiplify your cameras/buttons) USB interface... quick  

Weaknesses:  
Hard to pinpoint weakness but... USES LOTS OF JUICE. go ahead and just buy add-on Charger/Recharger when you order the camera. Recharges battery in about 90min and seems to last quite awhile under normal &quot;afternoon out&quot; type shooting. If I could add anything to camera it would be 3X vx. 2X Zoom, and more control over camera settings. but again what can you ask for in smallest package around at a great price.  
Similar Products Used:  
  Epson 750Z HP 200 Kodak 280 Poloroid PDC3000 (pro)

Bottom Line:
If you are looking for a camera to take great pictures and also BE WITH YOU TO CAPTURE THAT GREAT MOMENT??? THIS IS IT. <br><br>
