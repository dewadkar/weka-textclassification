             I own a 1997 Mercury Sable Wagon and with the exception of braking and snow going capability this is a car that does nothing exceptional but does everything very well. I have the 4 wheel disk with anti lock brake and it will stop on a dime. As far as running through the snow the more snow in front of it the better it does. Ride and handling are good for a wagon, and acceleration with the 3.0 liter Vulcan V-6 is adequate. Consumer reports does however recommend the 3.0 Vulcan over the Duratech V-6 for proven dependability. I used it to move from one house to another with absolutely no problems with room for boxes and small pieces of furniture. In short as far as american family cars go this is a first rate wagon that I truely enjoy taking on trips. I have owned over 30 cars in my life from most manufacturers and this is a car I would recommend with no hesitation to a friend.<br><br>
