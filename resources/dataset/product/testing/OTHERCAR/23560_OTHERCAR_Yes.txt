            First off lets start with the truck I am talking about. It is a 1998 Z71 extra cab short bed in a deep green with a matching canopy and LS trim, riding tall and looking good while doing it. The interior is a gray nappy cloth that is very durable and very comfortable. With all power features clearly marked and easy to use (the window controls light up at night) and all the ergonomics squared up from a 1995 interior redo by GM, the truck is now fresh and modern and all controls fall easily to hand. Set the six way power seat and the lumbar support and get ready to put on some serious miles because this truck loves to run and play.

The motivation for this urban beast is a 255 horsepower VORTEC 350 that moves this truck with serious authority. There is never a moment when this motor is in need for power. Merging onto highways and passing is a breeze even when going up hill and I have put it up against a friends 5.4 liter Triton Ford and it walked away from it. Amazing when you consider the architecture for this motor dates bake to the mid 60's. In moving onto the highway expect a trip to 60 MPH to take around 8.5-9 seconds. No other truck in this class can touch this Chevrolets motivation. NONE. I had the opportunity to cross a fairly steep pass in this truck and not only did the truck stay in OD with the cruise set, it never went below 70 the whole way up. Folks if you want affordable power, this is the truck for you.

With the Z71 option, handling is excellent also. This truck sports the first independent front suspension on ANY light weight truck chassis and with it comes tenacious handling in turns, a smooth supple ride on the interstate, and a relaxed trip no matter the destination.

A lot has been said about the economy of trucks. If you want mileage in the mid twenties get a turbodiesel but for the gas 350 VORTEC expect about 16-18 on average, less if it is doing city driving only. With the 36 gallon gas tank we made it almost 530 miles before worrying about filling up. AWESOME!

For a truck that entered production in late 1987 as a 1988 replacement, this is the last year for the half ton in this body before the 1999 redo. Twelve years of one design speaks volumes about the construction and popularity of this truck and with 1998 being the last year, you can be assured of the "Bugs" being worked out of it.

Rest assured folks if you want a great late model used truck, has Chevy got a deal for you!
