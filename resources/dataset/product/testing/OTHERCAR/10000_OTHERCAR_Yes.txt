            Well, my wife and I decide that it was time to replace these clunkers that we have.
We got on the net, checked some sites, read some opinions, and then we did some test driving.
Well, we knew that we had to have a car that was fairly cheap. So, we started with the Hyundia and then the Daewoo. Finally, we stopped at Montgomery Imports which sell Kia's.
I told my wife that I have heard several people talk about these cars.
So we decided to test drive one.
We drove a 2000 KIA Sephia LS. This car had it all. 
It had anti-lock brakes, dual airbags, side impact beams, power windows, power locks, power mirrors, tinted windows, tilt, cruise, and to top it all off, it had a very nice sounding stereo with an Alpine CD player.

This car had a 1.8 liter 16 valve dual overhead cam engine which produces about 145 HP. Not bad for a 4 cylinder, I said to myself.

After some looking, we loaded my twin boys (14 years old ) into the back seat, the wife in the passenger seat and I jumped into the drivers seat.
And off we went. 
I was pleased at the space this car had to offer. I am a pretty big fella ( 6'4" and 250 LBs ). I actually had head room. And I could almost straighten my legs out.
We drove this car for about 30 min. and then took it back.

My wife decided that she liked this car.
So, we talked to the sells rep. and started to get some figures.
The best that they could come up with was $14,500.00.
I told myself that that was a little high and then told the sales rep. Thank You for your time.
We started to walk to our car, and out came the sales rep.
He said that he could knock of ann additional $500. 
I told him that we needed to go back inside.
We sat back down, did some more figuring, and with tax, title and Lic. fees, the total for this car was $14,900.00. 

I told him to get his boss. The boss came into the office and I showed him the figure. Then I told him that I would give him no more than $12,500 cash. 
Boy, I thought it was christmas the way his eyes lit up.
We closed the deal and drove off in our new Sephia.
So far, it has been a very nice ride.

Well, now we have had this car for almost 1 year and it had to go to the shop only twice thus far.

The first time, I was driving down the road and my engine light came on. I stopped the car and pulled out my owners manual to find out why??

It read that it could be caused by several things and to take it to a dealer soon.

So I called the dealer the next day and they had me bring it in so that they could check it out.
During this time, they gave me a loaner to use while they were woking on mine.
About 2 hours later, they called me and told me that they will have to order a chip for the car.
The chip controlls the sensor that tells the computer that there was something wrong with the fuel pressure.
The dealer told me that either I left the car running or maybe I left it in the on position while I filled up with gas and this caused the sensor to tell the computer that there was a problem.

Well, they called me 2 days later and replaced the chip with a new one that bypasses this.

The other time I had to bring the car to the dealer was last month in July when my weather stripping around the drivers side door came loose.
They had it replaced in about an hour and I was off again.

All in all, I am still very pleased with this car.
I am getting about 290 miles on a tank of gas ( 13 gal. ), but I could probally get a little more if my foot wasn't so heavy.
I still recommened this car for the budget minded people out there.
