            Well designed camera and fun to use. Zeiss Optics were a big reason I picked this camera. Color reproduction is amazing, zoom in and out is smooth and effective. Even at a distance closer than 1/4 inches one can get a clear, sharp image! I like the simulated shutter sound that the camera has as an option when you snap a photo. It is little things like this that impress me regarding the features and engineering of this digital camera, aside from the obvious quality of the images. I get a lot of attention too when I take the camera out, everyone seems to want to look at it. 

The design is nifty. At almost $1000 you would think that Sony could include more than an 8 meg memory stick, and that a case would be included. Also would like an option to use standard batteries instead of being forced to use the custom SONY rechargable; but its nothing to loose sleep over. This camera is built to perform and it is easy and fun to use, with nice features. <br><br>
