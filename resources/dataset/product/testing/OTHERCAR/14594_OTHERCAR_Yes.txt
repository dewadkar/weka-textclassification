                 In May of 1999, I got into an accident and totaled my truck. Since my lifestyle is very dependent on an automobile and somewhat budgeted, I had to search for an inexpensive, used car.
     I was excited yet wary when I bought my 1991 Honda Accord LX for $2250 a month later. Since the car had 166,000 miles on it, I figured it would do the job, but I may have some heavy maintenance expenses in the future.
     32,000 miles and ten months later, the car has still held up with minimal problems. I can drive speeds in excess of 70 mph today with a smooth, quiet ride. Just about all the components in the car work including the air conditioning, radio, cruise control, and rear defroster.
     However, as with all good things, they seem to have their drawbacks... The electrical systems on my car have some sort of short or wiring problem. My fuses blow more often than normal, the automatic seatbelts some times do not retract, and something is draining the battery slowly when the ignition is off. These problems are minimal and do not pose any threat to a long term maintenance expense. They just become somewhat annoying.
     I would highly recommend this car to anyone who is looking for a car that will last them a very long time (300,000 miles) and at a decent price. The gas mileage is great, the ride is comfortable, and it is surprisingly roomy.<br><br>
