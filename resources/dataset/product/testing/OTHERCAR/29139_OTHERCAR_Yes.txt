            In a previous epinion, I had said the my wife and I had decided on the Chevy Impala to replace our old car.  That went out the windows after we drove the 2000 Volvo V70 wagon.

First, let me say that I have never owned a Volvo, or any other import.  But after perusing the lots of all the major US dealers, and looking at what the resale would be (based on 2-4 year old vehicle of those makes), we found that investing more up front in a Volvo will give us a much greater return on investment come resell time.

Now to the car.  

We drove the SE with the 2.4 liter 5 cylinder engine, leather seats, cold weather package, stability traction control and CD player.  It has decent pickup, and the handling is very nice.  Fit and finish are what you would expect from the Volvo line, everything is was nicely put together with attention to details.  Lots of extras (incl memory seat position, dual climate control, remote keyless entry ) were included in the base price as well.  Everything is where you would expect, and the car felt more like a sedan with lots of extra space than it did a wagon.  

The reason we bought it is simple.  For a little more a month, we got the security, safety, extra luxury features, and a better warranty than we would have in the Impala or Concorde we were considering.  

I think that when you consider what you get with the Volvo, and compare it to what you give up on the Impala and the Concorde, the decision is easy.  I liked the Impala immensely, and when my car gives up the ghost I may go that way ( I like the extra umph of the v8 engine), but my wife does real estate, and drives customers around, and carries those big &quot;For Sale&quot; signs, and the wagon gives her a comfortably, luxury ride and the space she needs.  

I guess I have officially become a Yuppie!

I will update this epinion as our experience with this car continues.
