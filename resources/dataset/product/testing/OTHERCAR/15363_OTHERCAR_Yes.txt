            I originally bought my Sony MVC-FD83 to use on a trip to see my wife's relatives in the Philippines. They live in a remote area where getting film developed is out of the question and buying fresh film is expensive. The camera was an instant hit with the whole town. I could snap a picture of anyone who came along (almost the whole town did sooner or later) and show it to them instantly on the LCD screen. I didn't have to worry about the expense of using film for all those shots because I could erase the pictures I didn't want and reuse the floppy disc. I still have a couple dozen discs that AoL sent out and sales and rebates are common if you want to buy new discs.

It is a very easy camera to use. My two boys, ages 3 and 5, like to take pictures with it any time I get it out. I don't speak Philippino but in less than a minute I was able to show one locals in my wife's home town (who doesn't speak English) how to use it to take a family picture. You can do a lot of fancy stuff with it or you can let the camera do all the work, it's up to you. When you want to view your pictures on your computer you just pop the disc into the slot. No wires, no cables, just click your mouse.

There are a lot of neat features built into the camera. You can get up to 40 pictures per disc depending on the picture mode you use. The lowest quality and highest quanity are suitable for e-mail. Another feature I love is the ability to take movies (and play them back in the camera) up to 30 seconds long.

Although a professional photographer would probably want a better, and more expensive, camera this camera will do for anyone else who wants a digital camera.
