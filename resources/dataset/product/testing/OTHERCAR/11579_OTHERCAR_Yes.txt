            I purchased my 1999 Isuzu Rodeo, my first brand new car, a little over a year ago.  Since then, my car and I have driven 22,432 miles and we have loved each other since the very first mile when we rolled off the lot for a test drive.  

I have driven in some tough conditions, snow, sleet, rain, ice, and even just off-road in the dirt and mud.  My only complaint about the car is the way it slides when I am driving around a corner in the rain.  I didn't realize you had to put the 4 wheel drive feature in gear for a drive in the rain.  At a perfect standstill, I attempted to turn and darn near skidded off the road, not fun.  Feeling like you are losing control of your 30 thousand dollar vehicle is no picnic, let me tell you.  

I do love the features that my Rodeo has, the front loading 6 disc CD changer, the sun roof, luggage rack, ample room for both me and my friends or their kids, I've even been able to fit a huge dog carrier in the back seat of the car and got it in with no problem, didn't even have to fold the seats down.

The seats in the Rodeo are so comfy I feel like I am in a LazyBoy recliner, only without my feet propped up.  If not for the fact that my hands are on the wheel, this feels like I am just floating down the road.  I don't have hardly any problems with the way the car handles in regular driving conditions at all.  

I am curious to know if anyone has had the problem I have with the Rodeo in the rain, as well as to find out just what problems people have with the CD players.  Mine seems to skip a LOT whenever I hit even the smallest bump in the road.  

All in all though, the Rodeo offers a lot more in the way of quality than I think the other similar brands of SUV's offer.  It all comes with a price, but I feel that my Rodeo was an investment that I can be happy with for years to come.
