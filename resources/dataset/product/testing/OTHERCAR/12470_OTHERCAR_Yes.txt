            Finally after a long wait Volvo has come out with a car for people with only a five-figure income.  The Volvo S40 is, by far, the nicest car out there for the money.  For right around $26k reasonably equipped, now you can afford the car that before you only dreamed of having.  

Leather interior, wood grain trim, moonroof, power everything, cruise, foglights, beautiful tires and rims, and a style to die for, you can turn heads without taking out a mortgage. I have test driven the Honda Accord, Oldsmobile Intrigue/Alero, Ford Contour, Subaru Impreza RS, and a few other cars, and nothing impressed me as much as Volvo did.  

My father has the 1997 960,  and you would not think that the new S40 is that much cheaper (as much as $8k or more).  But nothing is perfect.  Just like Honda,  Volvo seems to have a problem making options available as single options, and not only packages.  When I looked into the car, I would have liked to get the moonroof, but to get it, it came with the wood-grain trim,  which I hate.  I would also have to pay a lot of money for that package.  I'm not sure, but I think leather seats was in that package also.  Of the two or three,  I only wanted the moonroof.  It's a tossup,  get everything and pay for things you don't want, or miss out on one of those things you dreamed of having on such a wonderful car.  

One thing I urge Volvo to stay away from, unlike other manufacturers, the SUV market.  I dont know about anyone else, but a Volvo SUV just doesn't sound right.  <br><br>
