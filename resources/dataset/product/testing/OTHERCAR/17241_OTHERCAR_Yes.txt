            In 1992 I purchased a new Lexus ES 300.  My wife and I had been driving a Toyota Cressida and were very happy with it, but since it had been driven for 60,000 miles and we were planning a trip across the country, we decided to purchase a new one.  We discovered that 1992 was the year Toyota had stopped production of the Cressida, so we had to look for something comparable or a step above.  We decided on the Lexus ES 300.

We made the trip across the country in our new Lexus and it performed perfectly every mile of the 6,000 mile trip.  Since then, we have made several long trips around the country with always the same pleasant, carefree experience.  We have spent many hours on the road, delighting in the music from the outstanding sound system, as well as the smooth, comfortable ride.

At the present, I have 112,000 miles on it and believe it or not, it still drives and handles like a new car.  I have never driven a car for as long as I have the Lexus.  I intend to buy a new 2000 model in the coming year, but I intend to keep the 1992 Lexus as a second car.
