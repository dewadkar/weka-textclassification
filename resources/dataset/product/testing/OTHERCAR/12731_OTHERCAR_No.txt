Fuji has one of the best line of cameras. Just looking at the features you can see that it is a good camera. I will tell you a little about the features. LCD gives you a better quality and clear picture with better color. The expandable memory lets you have up to about 100 pictures on one 164-bit memory card (extra). Lets do places where a digital camera may not have be ably to go before, in areas with little water. 3x optical zoom it a good feature to have on any camera. To put that in MM it would be about 35-135mm. An AC-Adapter and rechargeable Li Battery will come free of charge if you can find it but do not get your hopes up. It took me almost 6 months to get the camera that fit what I needed. I would put a $1,200.00 price tag on this camera.  <br><br>
