            Ok, I've read some of the other opinions and I feel very bad for the people who got bad deals w/ their Neons.  I myself, love my Dodge Neon.  Ok, from the begining... I bought this vehicle USED in the summer of 1999.  The dealer had replaced the brakes... that's it.  I am still driving it without any problems that weren't caused directly by my own misuse of the car.  Some people drive their cars easy.  I on the other hand, do not.  I am the driver that most of you hate on the road.  Anyone ever take their Neon off roading? 

Ok, let's start with ease of shifting.  This car is a must have for anyone looking to start driving a standard.  I've never met a nicer clutch in my life.  My Neon responds well.  It corners tight, it drives well in the rain, it drives well when packed with 5 of my friends and doesn't bottom out if I'm not dumb about my driving.  

Can we say gas mileage? I can, and I can say excellent gas mileage too.  What do I call excellent gas mileage? 32 miles a gallon city and 38-40 miles a gallon highway.  Not only is the Neon cheap to buy, but it's cheap to drive too.

Someone complained about the sound system going out, darn, I've also never met a car that was easier to install a sound system in.  Mine is decked out and it went in in 15 minutes, no word of a lie, start to finish.  This is mostly due to the fact that this car is a Lego car.  EVERYTHING snaps together, try the air vents, or any panel for that matter.  Word of advice, don't try to pop off the steering wheel, I haven't tried yet but that's because I'm afraid it would work ;-)

Ok.  Bottom line.  It's not a luxury car folks.  It's a bottom of the line car. And when faced with the alternatives I'd choose the Neon any day.  Yes, you must be prepared to deal with minor annoyances and fixes... just like any other bottom of the line car.  This car is fun, period.  It's a great car for someone learning how to drive too.  Family's stay away, go get a caravan.  This is a young person's car.  It's a car to have fun with and to not take seriously, get a Cadi if that's what you want.  But in the mean time, I'm about to make my 8th trip back home from college (a 480 mile drive) in the past yea. oh yeah, by the way, I've put 45,000 miles on my car in less than a year and it's still purring like a kitten.
