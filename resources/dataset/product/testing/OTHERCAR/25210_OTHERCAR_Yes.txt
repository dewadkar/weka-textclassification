            Ok, so this isn't MY car, I can't afford one of these but my parents have one. There is only thing I don't like about it. No cruise control! But other than that, it's a very nice car. It drives very smoothly, corners nicely. My parents have the wagon type and it is great to take camping, just throw everything in the back and your all set to go. We've taken this car to Montana, which is a 12 hour drive 2 times. This car was terrific all the way there and the seats are comfortable.  Even the back seats are comfortable enough for 2 teenagers. For a while my parents thought this was a &quot;granny car&quot; so they bought rims for it and I have to say the rims on it, it makes it not look so much like a &quot;granny car&quot; anymore. <br><br>
