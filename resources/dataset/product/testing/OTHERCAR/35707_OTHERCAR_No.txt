            <i> A couple things to note: This review was posted several months ago under the general Volkswagen GTI category.  Since then, the titles changed and it somehow ended up in the GTI 1996 category.  This is still the old review, just moved to another category.  It should also be mentioned that the model I owned was a 1993 GTI that had a couple different features than the others did, but I mention those in this review.  I'm posting it in the closest year category available here on Epinions, after all, it was technically made in 1992 and Epinions is already swamped with category requests.  No sense adding more work for them for a single review.</i>



Scenario #1: Picture a hot day in July.  You just finished checking the oil in you car and while you were at it you decide to check some other liquid (anti-freeze, windshield, etc.) levels.  You finish up, it all looks fine so you take the car to work.


You come home and suddenly, no further from a mile from your house the temperature gauge skyrockets from its normal position straight into the red and the car stalls.  You get out and can smell the heat coming out of the engine.  As you step around the side of the car your foot falls into a puddle of green liquid.  You look under the car and see antifreeze gushing over the engine and dripping down the transmission.

#2:    You're stuck in stop and go traffic on the highway.  Finally the road opens up and being anxious, you of course step on the gas instantly to enjoy your newfound freedom.  You go to shift the car into 3rd and the stick gets stuck in neutral.  You shift back into 2nd and try to shift into 3rd again, this time with a bit of hesitation it shifts, then you let go and see the stick fall limply back into the neutral position.  You grab it, but realize it's still in 3rd gear.  No matter what position you move the stick in it's still in 3rd gear.  

Now, by the time you get home, you've been driving in 3rd for over a half hour simply because there's no way to shift the car out of gear, you let it stall in the driveway (since you can't shift into neutral) get out and hear liquid gushing out of the engine, onto the driveway.  You look under the car and see the same sight as mentioned in #1

#3:    You drop a friend off at their house and get back into your car and turn the key.  Nothing.  You turn it again.... still... nothing.  Now you try to remember if you ever left your headlights on for any length of time in the past, you try to remember how old the battery is, what brand it is, etc.   Figuring the battery died, you roll your car until it faces downhill.  You get in, release the brake and let it roll, hoping to pop the clutch once the car is moving fast enough.  No luck.  You keep at it with no luck, until you start to come up to an intersection and are forced to pull off the road.

After contacting a VW dealership courtesy of AAA, they tell you that the '93 models were built with a safety feature in the seatbelts that wouldn't allow the car to start unless the belt was buckled.  After explaining that the belt was, and is always buckled since it pulls forward and backwards when you enter the car.  They say there must be a short in the wire, and give out a pathetic little laugh, as if trying not to roll on the floor laughing hysterically.


For the year and a half I used this car, purchased new, I had all three of those problems happen to me, along with several minor inconveniences, like the cigarette lighter malfunctioning and various fuses blowing out.  The only thing a mechanic could find wrong with the car was the seatbelt and the linkage from the stick to the clutch, breaking.  As far as the overheating for no particular reason, they were dumbfounded.  They insisted that I pushed the car too hard and that I shouldn't do that when it was hot out.  &quot;Well thanks for the free advice ***hole&quot; were my thoughts after hanging up the phone, that still didn't explain why antifreeze was gushing out over my driveway.&quot;  I KNOW that's not normal for any car, yet no mechanic could ever solve that problem.

Everyone seemed to be crazy about this car though.  Several time's I'd be stopped and asked what year it was, if it was for sale, or how many miles are on it (98,000 by the way).  Luckily everyone else seemed to love this car, the money I made from selling it two years later, even mentioning the problems it had, was enough to place towards my Jeep, which, by the way hasn't nearly had the same amount of trouble as this car.
