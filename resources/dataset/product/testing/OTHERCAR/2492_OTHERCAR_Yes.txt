            For little over a year, I've owned a 1995 Hyundai Elantra. This car is very reliable in terms of it's engine performance and overall handling. Now I've owned a earlier Hyundai model before and I was convinced to stay with the Hyundai model. The Hyundai cars are very reasonable in price and affordability. Because the Hyundai has such a small engine it is obvious by the sound of the engine to seek maintenance on the Hyundai. Also, the engine size is simple. I am able to change my own oil and transmission fluid. Every part of the engine is reachable. 
Since I bought my Hyundai used, I've been very pleased with the overall performance of this car. I see no reason to change. Each year Hyundai comes out with a new style or an upgraded model of either the Excell, Elantra, Tibouron, and the Sonata. I may have missed one.

When your shopping for a new car, I recommend the Hyundai. It's sporty yet luxurious.<br><br>
