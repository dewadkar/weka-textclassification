               I purchased a 1997 model Monte Carlo from a used dealer about a year and a half ago.  There were very few miles on it, and I got it for much cheaper than I expected.  I used to own an old Monte Carlo, and usually love most old cars, but this one actually caught my attention.  It is black, so of course it caught my attention.  I took it for a test drive, and I fell in love with it.  I had owned a Pontiac Grand Am recently, and it was falling apart, so this car was a dream come true.  

   The interior in the car is leather, and feels wonderful.  The car comes with a cd player, power locks and windows, cruise control, heat/AC, and everything that you could want.  The car handles extremely well at all speeds.  Not only does it handle well, but the smoothness of the ride is incredible.  In the Grand Am, I thought I was hitting turbulance, but it was just the road, something strange happened when I drove this car, I didn't bounce up and down, it was strange, I had been doing that for five years.  I really did love the handling in this car, that is one of its finest features.

    The pickup in the car is also very nice, it is quick, and contains disc brakes, so braking is faster and more reactive.  It also features anti-lock brakes, as is standard with most newer cars.  Most cars, I can't drive in for much more than an hour or so without having to get out and stretch my legs, but this car is very spacious and roomy.  The back is a little bit cramped, but the front is extremely comfortable and with lots of room.  I have only had to take this car into the shop once since purchasing it, and it was because the spark plugs in it were recalled for some reason or another.  

    In short, I would recommend this car to people, it is a great car, and also affordable.  What more can you ask for?  Not too much for about 15,000.  Anyways, thanks for reading my review, and please check out my others.<br><br>
