            A year or so ago I never would have imagined myself owning a Hyundai.  But after a great deal of shopping around, I couldn't get over how favorably the Elantra compared to others in its class.  The redesigned 2001 had a real European look, and it really stood out in the showroom.  

Once I was behind the wheel, my opinion only got better.  It handled well, had better acceleration than the Civic or the Corolla and felt quite roomy inside.(The &quot;flimsy&quot; trunk lid has received a few comments on this site, but the trunk space is pretty impressive for a car this size.)  I really appreciated the little things like power mirrors that fold in for tight places, lumbar support, independent map lights and convenient cup holders.  With the money I saved, I was able to add some fun options, like the moonroof and CD player.  Plus you honestly can't beat the warrantee.  (5-yr. bumper to bumper, 10-yr powertrain and 5-year roadside assistance--not just for mechanical problems, but for lockouts, ran out of gas, accident, etc.)  

Some folks have suggested that the Hyundai might not have the &quot;resale&quot; value of a Toyota or Honda, but frankly, I'm looking for affordable, reliable transportation NOW.  With the warrantee being what it is, I doubt I'll be looking to sell in 3 years anyway.  Its a winner.  Test drive it and see for yourself!    <br><br>
