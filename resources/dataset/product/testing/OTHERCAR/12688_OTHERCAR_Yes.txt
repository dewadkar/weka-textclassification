            This is a follow up to my first article death trap.

Since the publishing of that article, I have encountered many more problems with my Cavalier.  I think that should be aware of these problems to become an educated consumer.

Where do I start?  
The beginning and a recap...Back in January of 2000, my car got a rebuilt engine because of a bad piston.  The dealership forgot to put a number of bolts back on.  First, we noticed the antifreeze container.  Well after that was fixed, we also noticed the antifreeze container wasn't strapped in.  Okay so no big deal.  Well folks, it's time for the rest of the story.

In June, the car went in shop for the rattling noise.  We told them that we thought that it was the motor mounts.  (We had several experts look at the car.)  The dealership told us they did not hear anything.  The dealership also replaced the broken seat belt covers, the squeaky vent, the 2nd gear light, and some broken plastic parts.

In June again, the car went back in the shop for the plastic parts.  My car had to go back a third time for the plastic parts.

In July, the car went to a different dealership for the rattling noise (i.e. motor mounts).  (Notice:  visit #2 for the same noise.)  They couldn't find anything wrong.  They also told us that they compared the movement of my motor to a new car.  The dealership told us that the movement of my car was normal.

In August, on my way to St. Louis, I noticed the air hoses weren't bolted in.  My car went back to the shop and got the air hose bolted in.  While it was in the shop, we had them look at motor again.  By now, my Cavalier was making a horrible sound.  I may also mention that my car was out the dealer warranty.  Guess what?!!!  They found that my motor mounts were bad!!!  Can you imagine that?  Well I am relieved that they found the problem but I think that is took them long enough.  They had to replace 2 motor mounts and something else.

In September, my car had an oil leak.  It went back to the dealership and was fixed.  It had a bad gasket.  My point for telling you this is that all the gaskets were replaced in January when the engine was rebuilt.

Well by now, I was completely frustrated.  I figured nothing else could be wrong.  how could I have been so stupid?!!!
I got my oil changed last week and they found that my oil plug was in really tight.  I don't know anything about cars so I can't explain what is wrong.  The problem with the oil plug put the dealership at fault.  So now my car is going back again.  
I can tell you that I am elated.
I hope that my shortcomings make you a more informed consumer.<br><br>
