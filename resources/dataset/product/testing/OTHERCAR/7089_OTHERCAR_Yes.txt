            My mother bought a Corsica in 1990, and I started driving it 2 years ago.  I must say it couldn't be a better car. It now has 155,000 miles and has had very few problems.  It also has power! Just tapping the gas makes the tires squeal, due to the 3.1 liter V6 under the hood.  The body has also held up very well, with only a minimum amount of rust. The only downside, is after ten years on the road the heater, defroster and a/c isn't what it used to be.  They still work but not exactly up to par.  It is a comfortable car to drive though, and I love it.  If anyone is looking for a affordably priced, reliable, comfortable car to drive, then it is definately for you.  It might look like any normal sedan, but I currently have a bra, gto black headlight covers, and a system including subwoofers on that car and it looks great.  Having my mother by this car back in 1990 was one of the best things she did.<br><br>
