            I purchased my 1991 Accord used a year ago this past April.  This is my fourth Honda product.  I purchased all the others with well over 100,000 miles on them and they all ran flawlessly, and I got each of them to over 200,000 before selling--not scrapping--them.  This specimen had 121,000 on it then and is pushing 155,000 now.  I snapped it up right away because it was the only Accord Wagon I'd ever seen with a 5-speed, despite a few character flaws I attribute to previous-owner bone-headedness, such as a broken antenna, cheesily-tinted windows, and rusty rear quarters (a flaw common to all older Hondas but easily preventable with periodic inspection and clearing of the rear-fender drains).  I am a musician and I have loaded my Accord to the gills with (heavy) musical gear.  It has never complained and, even loaded down, will return 25 mpg.  It handles great, and, with a 5-speed, is surprisingly quick.  I have had my share of fun dusting the occasional slammed import or Focus and enjoyed immensely the look on the driver's face as he/she watches my rear bumper bounce up and down between shifts.  The interior is likewise mint, with the exception of a Pioneer head unit and CD changer.  I have replaced the power antenna but will soon need a new one--my fault, not the car's.  Also, I have retrofitted a set of Accord EX six-spoke alloys.  What I have ended up with, I feel, is a remarkably well-built, slick-looking (but not ostentatious), efficient little hauler that can scoot pretty well when you ask it to.  If you can find one with a manual (they're out there, but rare), I say go for it.  Even in general, I cannot recommend the Accord wagon enough.  I'd buy another one in a second.  Don't think I'll need to for a while, though.
