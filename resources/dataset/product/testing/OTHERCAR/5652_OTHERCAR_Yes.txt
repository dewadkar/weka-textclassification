I recently purchased a BMW M Roadster. First the seating; Although the Z3 is very tiny, the spacing is quite roomy. I have plenty of leg room while driving and I am a pretty big man so take my word for it. Second; The stereo system is wonderful. What's great is the bass speaker between the two seats. When you accelerate, the bass gets larger and larger in sound. Third; The traction is excellent as long as it isn't wet, then I would recommend staying indoors. The car car would get great gas mileage if i was on the gas all the time, which is very difficult not to do. The trunk space is tiny but who needs alot of space in a car that is meant for driving. I would especially recommend heated seats because they have helped a bunch during the winter. Great car, I also recently purchased a Honda S2000 which is supposed to be &quot;the sportscar,&quot; but it still can't outperform my Beamer. Three thumbs up.<br><br>
