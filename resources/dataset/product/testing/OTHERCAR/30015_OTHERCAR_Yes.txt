            This is such a wonderful camera.  I have already wrote a review on the camera itself. I now wanted to write one on the ease of uploading photos from this camera.  

The DC 280 comes with Adobe Profession Photo Lab. It is a very simple program to use to work with your photos.  The camera has its computer ports right on the side of it with little tabs that open and close. I am slightly concerned about these tabs and only time will tell if they will hold up under my constant opening and closing. You can be sure that Kodak will hear from me if they do not. The camera is way to expensive not to last me years and years.  Anyway, the ports hook right up to your computer and one to power (if you purchase a seperate power plug which I highly recommend.  You will use a lot of juice while uploading your photos).

Once you have it hooked up you have only to open you Adobe and click on connect to camera. It is that easy.  You then choose the photos you want from thumbnails (little pictures of each photo you took) that are up on the screen.  Each photo takes approximately 1 to 2 minutes to upload depending on the spead of your computer.  My computer is pretty slow and takes almost the full 2 minutes.

That is all there is to it.  If you keep the photos in ppd form they are just gorgeous and full of detail, but VERY large. They can be from 5 to 6 MG in size. I only keep very special photos at this size and all others are saved to jpg which takes them down to a more managable size of 20 to 100 kb.  

The camera can also take pictures from the computer. When the photo program is open, there is a button that says &quot;Take Photo&quot;.  You just have to push it and the camera goes off. This is how I get pictures of myself for the internet. I just set it there and aim it at me while pushing that button. Works perfect.

Overall, uploading using the DC280 is simple.  You don't have to be a rocket scientist.  So don't be afriad to go digital. It is the only way to go!<br><br>
