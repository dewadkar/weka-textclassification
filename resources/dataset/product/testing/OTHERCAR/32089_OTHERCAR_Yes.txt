            What can I say about the 325i?  It's an amazing car!  You get a mix of sports car and luxury car rolled into one.  I test drove a variety of vehicles before I finally decided on the 325i and it was by far the best vehicle I drove - there honestly isn't one thing I can find wrong with it.  I tried an Acura RSX - too much road noise and a very bumpy, harsh ride.  I tried a Toyota Celica - horrible ride and it just didn't "feel" right to me.  Then I drove a 325xi and fell in love, but I was a little put off by the price, so I continued my search.  Next came an Audi A4 1.8, which I was hoping I would like, considering it is supposedly comparable to a BMW and comes with a lot of things standard that cost extra on a BMW, like a 6-disc CD player and headlight washers, not to mention $500 will get ALL your seats heated, unlike the BMW which just offers front heated seats.  On top of that, the Audi is a few thousand less than the BMW.  

I wasn't too enthused about the bubble shape of the Audi, but I hoped it would drive nicely so I could save a little money and still get a great car.  Alas, the Audi rides horribly - the transmission doesn't seem to want to shift (especially between 2nd and 3rd...at least that's what it seemed like to me) and although it only trails the 325 by 24hp (184 for the BMW, 160 for the A4), it has NO power!  The Audi has a supercharged V4 while the BMW has a V6, so that probably has a lot to do with it and I'm told the BMW can "crank out a lot more torque" than the Audi; plus, the Audi has front wheel drive and the BMW is rear wheel drive, so that too could make a difference.  I drove an A4 with the sport package but nothing on that car felt sporty.

My BMW has the sport package and therefore doesn't feel quite as smooth as the 325xi I originally test drove, but there isn't that much of a difference.  The interior is very nice - I got black leatherette (you can't even tell the difference between the leatherette and the real leather, so why pay a grand or two more for the real leather when it will just end up fading more quickly?), a moonroof, heated seats and the aforementioned sport package.  The exterior is Jet Black, which in my opinion looks 10 times better than the metallic black BMW offers, which tends to look dirty even when the car is clean.  There are quite a few added extras to appreciate on the inside of the car, like the little coin holder on the center console - definitely not something you NEED, but definitely a nice thing to have.  The glove compartment seems rather small, but anything I can't store in there I can keep in the surprisingly large trunk.  The backseat is really tiny, but I don't often have backseat passengers anyway, so that's of no major concern. 

There's no alarm on the 325i, although the key system is supposed to be your alarm because the car cannot be started without one of the two keys that come with the vehicle.  When you lock the car with your key - which also serves as the remote - the lights flash, giving the impression that there is an alarm...my dealer said I could have an alarm installed for a few hundred dollars, but he didn't feel I needed it, considering the area where I live is a "nice" place with few car thefts, but I still worry.

The last thing I'll mention about the BMW is its warranty - simply unbelievable!  You are responsible for absolutely nothing but tires and gas on a BMW for 3 years (the warranty can be extended for a few hundred dollars).  The computer in the engine of the car will alert you if something does go wrong with your car or it will let you know when you need an oil change (approximately every 15,000 miles), which takes a lot of worrying out of driving for me.  My guess is the reason BMW can offer such a great warranty is because you'll rarely need to take advantage of it - the car is so highly rated by everyone from Car and Driver to Consumer Reports, there seems to be little that can go wrong with this fine piece of machinery.  It's a great warranty to go along with a great car.
