            I must start out saying I have a prejudice against this van. It has NOTHING to do with the van itself. My husband bought this van after a week of us shopping together for a new van. It was just a casual shopping around. We didn't NEED a new van. Our 95 Windstar was just fine with me. But we were looking, spurred, I hate to admit by a rental that had the 2 sliding doors and constant advertisement of the Quest with its television. Just about the time I had decided to stick with our Windstar...my husband called. Come to the Plymouth dealership...He had BOUGHT a new van. A van I HAD NOT TEST DRIVEN. ARGGGH! How dare he choose a van that *I* would drive daily. I was so mad I could hardly look at him. 

On to the specifics of the van. We have 3 children, all still in some form of car seat. My daily routine requires a lot of short distance driving. (carpooling to and from preschool, grocery store trips, errands, etc) We also do quite a bit of mid-distance weekend trips of about 2 hours each way. On top of that...over the past year, I have also made several trips to see my mother, 16 hours away. 

The convenient things about the van are as follows:
1. It is easy to park, relative to its size. Other minivans, especially the Windstar (which I loved) are often hard to park in tight parking spaces. (Common in the places minivans most often are found:school parking lots, grocery stores, parks)

2. The two doors are a great asset to loading and unloading quickly
3. The rear control for the heat and A/C as well as the dual climate zones have made car trips more comfortable for all. I have a husband who is always complaining about how hot it is...until this van
4. Displays for the most part are logically laid out.
5. Ride is smooth and quiet
6. Accelerates smoothly and powerfully on to the freeway.  

Things that irritate me about this van:
1. The turn signal indicators are not in the main display but in a separate thing above the steering wheel. After nearly a year of driving this van, I find that disconcerting
2. The middle seats don't have easily accessed cup holders. They are under one of the captains chairs. Not only does this make for difficult access, it also means that a cup left in there will get kicked over by children coming through the middle aisle OR the open holder will trip someone. 
3. Several niggling electrical problems, the passenger side window won't always roll down. I also had to replace a turn signal light bulb that exploded before there were 5000 miles on the van.
4. You can't &quot;flip&quot; the seat for access to the &quot;way back&quot; if there are car seats buckled into the second row. This is ok for children who can buckle themselves in to the back seat, but an adult walking down the middle aisle is ridiculous. 
5. Some minivans have more options as far as arranging the seats. These options would be handy. I would love to have more &quot;trunk space&quot; some days. 

6. Infant car seats with bases do not install correctly into the bucket seats. It took 4 professionals to get an infant car seat installed into the seat correctly. That is a big safety concern. 85% of car seats are installed incorrectly. Anything that makes that more difficult is a problem. If it took professionals so long to get it right...imagine all those car seats that are incorrectly installed in this minivan! 

7. My husband is bothered by the range of the seat adjustment. He would like to sit further back from the steering wheel. 

Oh...and I hate the color. ;-) <br><br>
