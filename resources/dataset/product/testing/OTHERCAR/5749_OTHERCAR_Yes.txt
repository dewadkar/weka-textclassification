            When I first saw my new 2001 Sebring out the Chrysler's Dealer shop in Athens (Hellas) waiting for me , I was at least amazed by its beauty. (Inferno red Tinted Pearl Coat the exterior Color , black cloth top and Sandstone leather trim the interior)

The seats are perfect with a very good quality of leather and the car is extremely comfortable even for the rear passengers. The instruments are white with illuminator in the night. The sound system from Infinity is at least perfect and the only thing I added was the 4 Disc CD changer.

The engine is the 2.0 DOHC 16v 141 HP and it's quite good for the conditions of my island. (I'd prefer however the 2.7 with the 200 HP one :))

It has very good behavior at the street and even if you push it , it does not surprise you (even though the suspension is a little soft and long).

The only problem I can see to this car is that EVERYBODY is looking at you when you drive !!! you cannot drive and stay unnoticed ... (if of course is a problem !!!)

I believe it's the PERFECT CHOICE for a convertible.
