            It was kind of hard to say goodbye to my 1997 Mirage LS coupe. A few days ago I traded it in at a Volkswagen dealership in Auburn Washington &amp; left in a spanking new VW Jetta. I had purchased my Mirage brand new also, &amp; was very happy with my choice for the 3 years I owned it. The appearance of the car reminded me of the Honda Civics of a couple years ago. It was sleek &amp; after tinting the windows, It looked quite sporty. In fact, I had found the car to be a more attractive buy than the 1997 Civic. The Mirage came with a standard CD player/tape player combo &amp; had a nice stock system built by Infiniti. The interior was laid out very well with everything easy to reach. There was also a center arm-rest that had a  ample storage compartment that held CD's perfectly. I liked the seats too. They adjusted to any position including in height which was not common in a sub-compact in those days. Being a sufferer of long commutes, I found the seats to be very supportive &amp; comfortable. The performance of the vehicle was also impressive for one in its price range. The 113 Hp engine coupled with a manual transmission, provided nice torque &amp; smooth &amp; quick acceleration. The handling was decent as well, but a little too much body roll during hard cornering. All in all, I never had one problem with my Mirage for the three years I owned it. The down side to owning this vehicle along with most Mitsubishi cars, is that the depreciation is horrible. I had purchased the car for $16,000 &amp; by the time I traded it in, it was worth about $5,400. In fact I ended up having to come up with the difference between the value &amp; my loan pay-off. Other brands like Toyota &amp; Honda, keep their value much better even though in most ways, there is no advantage they have over Mitsubishi's..All in the marketing I guess. Anyhow, I do strongly recommend looking into the Mirage, especially the LS models, if you are looking for a very good car at a very good price. If you want to buy a used one, check the papers or Auto-trader magazines. Chances are you could find a great deal on a car that'll make you or the driver to be, very happy..    <br><br>
