            On December 1st I took my 1987 Dodge Ramcharger in for repairs. My mechanic is also a used car dealer and as I was waiting for a ride home I zeroed in on a beautiful white 1995 Mercury Sable GS. I knew how wonderful a Sable was because my mom owns a 1993 Sable LS. I am only 35yrs old but this Sable feels sporty and also has luxury &amp; comfort. It's very sharp looking and only had 60k miles on it. I live in my car, (I run our home improvement business), so I needed the room &amp; comfort but I was not ready to &quot;grow up&quot;. With my Sable I can have a car that gets alot of compliments on it's looks &amp; still have practicality. It is a breeze to drive &amp; handles like a small car that hugs the road. For only $7,000.00 I got all the extras, cruise control, Tilt wheel, P/S, ABS, Air, power doors, seats &amp; windows, great sound system(stock). It's a 6 cyl. but it goes! I am in love with this car. It's great for adults who still don't want to grow up!<br><br>
