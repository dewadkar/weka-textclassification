            Eleven years ago, my husband took my daughter and I car shopping. We were in need of a vehicle and definitely due for one. We drove around looking and ended up at a Pontiac dealership. Needless to say, I was somewhat pleased at what I saw there and I owned one before leaving the lot.

We checked out the cars and purchased a 1990 Pontiac Grand Am. This car was brand new.  It was white with silver moulding/trim. Bright, shiny, and sparkly.  Initial inspection and testing of the car showed us that it was roomy, well designed, got good gas mileage, had some power to it, presented many features and met our needs perfectly.  We purchased the car that day and took it home with us.

The car has been in our family for 11 years.  I cannot say that it is still with us because we love it that much, although that car has been dependable for that long.  We still have the car because we simply cannot afford to go into debt for another one.  It's a simple case of make do with what you have for the time being.

For the first few years, I had no complaints with the car.  It presented plenty of power.  It took us where we needed to go.  We made several trips over highways and byways with this car.  It rode comfortably.  We were comforted with a nice interior design, plenty of leg room, powerfully cold air conditioning, a terrific am/fm cassette sound system, cruise control, tilt wheel, and much more.  We simply couldn't ask for more.

The first sign of problems came with the exhaust system. It simply wouldn't hold up.  The exhaust and muffler were constantly rusting and large holes were developing.  I cannot tell you how many exhausts have been replaced on that car in the 11 years of ownership.  The next headache that we developed came in the form of the comfort.  The shocks/struts system went downhill fast.  The car that once rode so smoothly was now slamming us hard over ever bump and groove in the roadway.  Heaven forbid we actually HIT a pothole.  We would have sore rears for weeks.  The car was taken to a service center for repair and replacements were placed on the car.  Then, later on, more replacements were put on the car.  Regardless of how many times the parts were replaced, the car never improved.  Once that original set wore, the comfort was totally shot!

The final and possibly the largest headache of all, well, that would be the body.  You see, the body started rusting quickly.  The problem spots seemed to be the corners of the doors.  They soon became devoured by rust.  Then the paint itself started to crack and peel.  Seeing how well I like to maintain my vehicle, we took the Pontiac to a shop to have it painted.  (This is an entirely different nightmare and will probably warrant a future epinion!)  The car was painted and within a matter of months, the problem returned.  I made the decision not to waste my time and money having it re-painted.  I felt that it would do no justice at that point.

As far as the motor and transmission are concerned, I have had no major problems with these important components of my automobile.  I have noticed that this car has lost power, especially on inclines, over time, but that is to be expected with age.  The car has never truly been "run hard" although it has gone on long trips.  I have had a few occasions where the motor did get hot and the temperature gauge soared, but this is generally solved with the replacement of the thermostat.  The air conditioning has had to have freon added to it on a few occasions, but again, expected with time.

My general and overall opinion of this 1990 Pontiac Grand Am is that it is a strong and sturdy, dependable car, perfectly designed for single individuals, couples, and small families.  It, like most vehicles, is not without it's faults, for sure.  I have had worse vehicles to contend with.  I have "babied" this car, as my family tends to put it.  It is in immaculate condition inside and would be outside, had the body and paint chosen to cooperate.  I clean the inside and outside regularly, have it waxed, and do not "overdrive" this vehicle.  For the first 8 years of ownership, this car stayed below 60,000 miles.  Perhaps the best compliment that I could make would be to end this opinion letting you know that, if I were to go buy a new car today, another Pontiac would definitely be an option.
