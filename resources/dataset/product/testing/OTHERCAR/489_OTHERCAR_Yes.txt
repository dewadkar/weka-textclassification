            The first time I saw a Miata I was spellbound.  I wasn't sure what it was and I didn't want to get to close.  I was afraid someone would be guarding it and jump out and yell at me.  Besides, I'm a woman and gushing over a strange car seems like a &quot;guy thing&quot;.  I told my husband about this fantastic car I had seen and he told me that it must be a Miata.  We were out hopping around Milwaukee one day about one month later and drove by a Mazda dealer.  On a whim we decided to stop in.  To make a long story short, we ended up ordering one that very day, though at a dealer close to home in Racine.

I have never been so happy with a car for so long - or babied one so much.  I do store it every Winter and I have to admit that is probably one of the reasons why, after ten years, it still runs like new.

I have to admit that I am a little envious of the enhancements that have been added to the newer models and some of the new colors are really sharp.  Still, I probably would get a red one again.  After all, a little red sports car is classic.  And I think it is cool to have a 1990 Miata.

The car has very good performance.  It was definitely designed right.  The weight to power ratio is very balanced.  The thing I like to show off the most is its manuverability.  This car turns on a dime and is so easy to park.  The road feel is very real.  You feel things, but you don't get jarred, and you feel like you're really sticking to the road: no jumping or drifting.  

Other things I like are the trunk, it has a lot more run than you would think and the seats are very comfortable.  The roof is easy to put up and down.  The hardest thing about it is unzipping the window.  And it is so easy to clean.  The paint is high quality and still shines like you would not believe.
