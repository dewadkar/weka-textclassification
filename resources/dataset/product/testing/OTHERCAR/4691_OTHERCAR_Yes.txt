            I've owned a 1991 Land Cruiser (the first of the FJ-80 style) for a number of years now and I've got to say - it has grown on me like no other vehicle ever has.

My Cruiser is fairly basic, 4 liter, cloth interior, etc.  I got a killer deal on it (I used to sell Toyotas) and it has only marginally lost value.  It's not powerful off the line, but it holds its highway speed well.  It's not fuel efficient, but I know if I ever hit or got hit, the other guy would almost certainly lose.  It handles great, considering its size, and off-road - watch out (as in fantastic!).

I have had a few electrical problems, like the driver's window ($415) and then the driver's side passenger door window, and now the driver's door lock mechanism ($375 just for the part - ouch!).  Other than that, with regular maintenance, shop-free.  Oh, yeah, the right front axle seal a couple of years ago - about $200.

Sure, a few shortcomings/problems, but there's no other vehicle I've ever had that I would rather take on a long trip/expedition.  It's never left me stranded.  Maybe that's why the Land Cruiser has such a reputation.  Get one and see for yourself.<br><br>
