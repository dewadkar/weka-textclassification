            We purchased our 1993 Jeep used last year and have not regretted it for one minute.   Its a nice looking vehicle that has been very dependable, even in the coldest of winters (this morning the windchill is 30-40 below and I won't have a problem starting it).   Living in snow country, the 4 wheel drive has been a blessing to us.   As we have a long driveway, we depend on the Jeep to get us out before we can get plowed out.   Mechanically, we have had no major problems.   We have replaced the serpentine belt, but that's it.   The front seats are comfortable, and it came equiped with power windows/power locks, AM/FM cassette, AC and a luggage rack.  However, the air conditioner does need recharging.  The one negative comment I can make is getting in and out of the back seat can be difficult.  But it is fine for children.  The handling is superb, whether it be going through snow drifts or in the backwoods in 4WD.  I would recommend this vehicle to anyone!
