            Make no mistake about it, the GMC Yukon is a truck. Not that that's a bad thing, it is what some of us need. What is great about it is the way it does not feel like a truck to drive or park. We used to have an SUV, here is how we happened upon our new Yukon:

My wife and I went to our preferred auto/truck dealership looking to replace her Jeep Grand Cherokee. I was leaning toward another Jeep but cargo room was becoming an issue with transporting supplies for our growing business.

I read about the redesign of the Yukon/Tahoe and I was impressed with the new offerings. I was also intrigued by their concept. Rather than chasing Ford to one up them and reclaim the title of the &quot;biggest&quot; they listened to what people wanted. Cargo, payload, towing are all givens, it needed to be in a package that 1) fits in your garage  2) can negotiate a parking lot and 3) doesn't require OPEC connections to keep it fueled up.

Size a side, I test drove the Yukon and a new Grand Cherokee(comparably equipped with a V8).  Hands down in all categories, it was quieter, smoother ride/handling and more comfortable. Ours came with the bucket seat option which are really more like &quot;captain's chairs&quot; with fold down arm rests built in to the seats. The turning radius and width of the Jeep were smaller but not night &amp; day noticeable(maybe 4-5 inches). We bought the same Yukon we test-drove that day.

The only thing I don't like is it seems like they wasted a lot of possible storage space in the rear. They give you a mini-glove box sized compartment in addition to the jack storage compartment, which only fits the jack. You can not really store any thing under the back seats. It looks like there is a lot of space there when they are in the upright position. When you fold them down the seat backs lay flat on to all of that floor space. I have found some &quot;hidden&quot; space to store the offroad gear &amp; jumper cables. If you open the jack storage and look to the right of the opening you can get a set of heavy gauge jumper cables and a collapsible trenching shovel into that space.

If you need utility, you won't have to sacrifice comfort&amp; maneuverability with the Yukon.<br><br>
