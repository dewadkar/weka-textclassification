            This is my girlfriends new car, and I have to say I like it. It looks good inside and out, and is solidly built. She has put about 40,000 miles on it already, and despite a few minor recalls early on, she hasn't had any problems with it. It has good fuel efficiency (about 28-30 around town, and 35 on the interstate). She owns the GS model which came with power locks/windows/steering, a very chilly AC, cruise control, and a nice stereo with cassette.

The reason I say that it is built with women in mind is due to the layout of the vehicle. The bottoms of the seats sit high up so that shorter people can view the road with great ease, and the way the seat is positioned even those with short legs can reach the petals in comfort. The controls for everything in the car are only a few inches to a foot and a half from the steering wheel, and the steering wheel can be raised and lowered with a lever to accommodate the driver. Even the seat belt is adjustable so that the shoulder strap won't strangle the driver/passenger.

As for the ride of this car, I like it too. It corners fairly well (my old Toyota Corolla will do better), and the speed sensitive steering is very nice. It is quiet inside, unless you're jammin' the radio. In my humble opinion, it also has great pick up for a 4 cylinder. Of course, anything better than my car's 0-60 in 6.5 days is good. :)

All in all, I recommend this vehicle for those who want a great car for the money. I especially recommend this car for someone who is a little shorter, because of all the extra effort that was put into the car's design.<br><br>
