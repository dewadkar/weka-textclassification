            I haven't owned my  '99 Sunfire for very long, but the reason I loved it is why I plan to buy another one.  I was recently in a fairly serious car accident, and my beloved car was totaled.  However, I walked away only with bruising from my seat belt, and a mildly injured knee.  If you take a look at the pictures of my car and then look at me, it can clearly be seen who saved who.  The air bag definitely saved my face, and the front portion of the car crumpled on impact only in the front, saving my legs.  They were not pinned by any part of the car that could have been pushed farther into the interior on another car.  When I look at the damage to my Sunfire, and then look at some other cars, I truly believe that with the another car, my injuries sustained would have been worse.  The people who came to help me out of my car after the collision were thoroughly surprised to see me jump out.  A police officer on the scene also said that the car did what it was designed to do, crumple on impact.  When my car was driveable, I loved the way it handled, and it always ran well.  I loved the interior, front and back seats, and one thing I especially liked was the feel of the steering wheel.  It kind of sounds weird, but the design of the steering wheel made my trips more comfortable just because of the extra padding.  The front seats were very comfortable as well.  Being a young driver, I also liked the sporty look of the vehicle.  My original motivation to buy this car was the price, but I think it is worth more because of the overall good experience of owning it, and I would recommend it for anyone.  I plan for my next car to be a Sunfire as well because I know I will feel safe driving it.    <br><br>
