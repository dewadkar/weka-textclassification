            After a lot of research, we took the plunge and purchased a Mazda Protege as our main family car.  We've never regretted the decision.  After 5 years it is still going strong with no problems, major or minor, with the car itself.  We've blown a couple of tires so we know it handles well in adverse conditions.  The biggest drawback is the front seats are uncomfortable on long drives.  The back seat however, holds 2 full size car seats easily and you can fit 2 booster seats and 1 adult with only a little squishing.  Also, a big selling point for us was the size of the trunk.  You can fit a lot of shopping bags or luggage in there.  It's been great for our cross country moves.  <br><br>
