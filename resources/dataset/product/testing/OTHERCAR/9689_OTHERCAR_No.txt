            Car is a good reliable automobile that will get you from point A to B.  I bought this car used with 59,000 miles on it.  I still own it and it has surpassed the 170,000 mile mark.  It has been trouble free with exception to the noisy valves that I replaced myself for less than $100 bucks.  I must say that I change the oil every 5000 miles and do the 30,000 mile maintenance religiously.

A - Acceleration - Although this car is equipped with a 1.8 liter engine, it is still peppy enough to keep up with traffic.  But if you have the air condition on, you lose all power.  The air condition works well and is ice cold.

B - Brakes - the brakes are lousy on this car.  The pads that came with it are noisy and produce lots of brake dust.

C- Comfort - The seats are very uncomfortable and are not for driving long distances.  The dash is awkward and sits high.  I am 5'9" and it took me a while to get used to the high dash.  So if you are short, you will have a hard time with seeing the road.

E- Efficiency - This car gets great gas mileage, 29-35 miles to a gallon driving in city traffic.

E - Exterior - The paint job is great.  I still get compliments on the car's shine.  

I-Interior - Build cheap, the interior lights go out quickly and are expensive to replace.  My interior defrost light and fog light switch cost $16 bucks to fix.  A year later, they went out again.  I am not going to spend another $1 to fix those lights.

M - Maintenance - The car is typical.  Nothing special.  Although Mitsubishi's are more expensive to fix than domestic cars.

N - Noise - You can hear every wind noise in the car.  In fact, if you drive over 65 mph, be prepared to turn up your radio or shout to talk.

P - Power - It has a 90 horsepower, 1.8 L engine, it accelerates okay, but only with one passenger and the air not on.  If you have passengers and the air is on, then be prepared to push the gas pedal down to the floor to get any reaction from the engine.  Once you get to 45 mph, the car maintains the speed well.

R - Roominess - The front seats are low but roomy, if you slide the seat all the way back.  The back seats are just for decoration.  You can't seat back there at all.

S - Sound system - The sound system stinks and is CHEAP.  If you decide to get this car, then go ahead and spend the money to get a new system.

T - The trunk space is small and just enough for groceries and one large suitcase.

Overall, the car is a good car for a college student with no family.  I have heard that these cars are a lot of trouble, but I have kept up with the maintenance and she has provided me with a good ride over the years.
