            I must admit that I don't know very much about cars, and so I probably shouldn't even be writing this epinion.  But since this site thrives on epinions like mine--from regular, average people who aren't very knowledgable about the things they review--I figure my two cents are just as good as any other.

I purchased my Metallic Beige (tan people, let's be realistic here!) 1991 Plymouth Acclain on my 18th birthday, back in March.  At that time it had just under 100,000 miles on it, and it was still a zippy little car, I loved it from the moment I set eyes on it.

I bought it from a guy at work for a song.  $2900.00 to be exact, and according to Edmunds (TIP: Always check out the blue book sites about used cars before going out and buying one.  Almost all of the sites are free to use and contain lots of tips and warnings about cars.  Combined with epinions--which helped me decide that this was a dependable car--you've got a lot of useful knowledge to help you out) it was worth about $4000.00 or so.

A few months later things are still great.  The odometer is sure to hit 103,000 by the end of the month and all I need to replace is the serpentine belt (Watch out in older cars, this one belt controls many of the engines major functions!  When it starts to wear, don't delay!), and new speakers as both are original factory parts, nothing major.

If you see this little car and you have a lot of flashier options to choose from, I would still go with the Acclaim.  It is a solid car that will do what you want it to.  Besides, nicer looking cars look twice as ugly when they get rusty or get cracked up!<br><br>
