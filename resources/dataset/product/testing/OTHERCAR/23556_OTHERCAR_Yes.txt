            what a great car the nissan 100 nx is.
i cannot recommend it highly enough.
mine is in black with a very easy to use and practical t-bar roof which looks great. with only a 1.6 engine i thought that it might be slightly under powered but was pleasantly surprised by the performance which is not earth shattering but more than ample.
the addition of a good pioneer cd player was essential but the radio cassette provided was perfectly useable. <br><br>
