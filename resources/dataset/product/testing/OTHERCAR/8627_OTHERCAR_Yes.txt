            The Odyssey is my third mini-van and it beats the others hands down!  I loved the low price for a fully-loaded, all power van.  It is more economical than my old Caravan, both in price and gas mileage.  The back seat folds into the floor with ease and the two middle seats are lightweight and pop out easily.  The middle spot in the bench seat has a shoulder harness that pulls down from the roof - great when transporting children!  I upgraded the interior to leather with help from my dealership, and at a reasonable cost.  Other nice features are being able to operate the radio volume and cruise control from the steering wheel, the fold-down tray between the front seats, and the many storage compartments.  All in all, this is a great van for a family from a trusted name in automobiles!
