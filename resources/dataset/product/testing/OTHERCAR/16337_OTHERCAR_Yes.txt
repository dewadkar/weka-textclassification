            I purchased this camera because of the price initially and because I like Hewlett Packard products.  I was not disappointed.  It takes amazing pictures and the cd package that comes with it is easy to operate.  However, I did find that I needed to buy a Sandisk Imagemate removable drive because it takes too long to download the pictures to the computer.  With this drive I found that it takes a matter of seconds to transfer a picture as opposed to 10 to 20 minutes.  Also, I decided to purchase a 32mb compactflash disk because if you are on a trip or at a special occasion you might need more room for pictures.  Also, you need to have an ac/dc adapter because the LCD screen eats batteries like crazy.  You can only purchase the adapter from Hewlett Packard as the attachment is like none I've ever seen.  However, Hewlett Packard is an excellent company to work with.  They have reliable tech assistance.  All in all, I am very satisfied with my camera and, if I had to do it again, do not regret my decision.<br><br>
