            I recently purchased the 2000 Dodge Durango and I love it. It is by far the best vehicle I have ever owned. 

There were three major facts that influence my purchased of this SUV. One was that I just had a baby and I wanted a vehicle with good safety features. I also like the price range of the Durango. The third reason was my previous experience with Dodge. 

I purchased the 4x2 Durango with the SLT package, tow package, 5.2L V8 (318 CID). The seats are leather and pretty comfortable considering they are truck seats. My Durango also has the third row seat, which actually is large enough to fit a full size adult. The interior is very roomy, with plenty of room in the back for storage when the third row is folded down. I love the overhead computer that tells you the temperature, how much gas you have left, average gas mileage, etc. 

It doesn't get gas mileage like car does, but what you expect from a big engine.<br><br>
