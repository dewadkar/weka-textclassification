            If you are looking for a good, reliable minivan that gives you enough space for a family of 4+ then you ought to think about the Dodge GrandCaravan.  We bought the GrandCaravan Sport that gives a sporty look to the minivan.  

The ride is great and smooth.  It drives and handles like a car but gives you room to move.  Some additional features that are very handy on our minivan include climate control for driver and passenger, control of rear vents from driver seat and a flip down tv/vcp that we added.  With small children these features are very useful.  It also has the sliding rear doors on both side which is a must if you are buying a minivan. 

Even with the third seat in place, there is still an ample amount of room for luggage, etc.  If you need more room, you can take out either the back bench or the middle bench or both. The seats are very easy to remove and reinstall. The middle bench also has the integrated child seats that just flip over and are ready for a toddler.

If you are looking at minivans, look at the Dodge GrandCaravan.  I can not list all the great features in one article.<br><br>
