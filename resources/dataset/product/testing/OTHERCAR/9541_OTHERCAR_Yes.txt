            My first car was a 1988 Toyota Celica Hatchback.  I loved that car and never forgot it.  The first time I saw a picture of the 2000 version I knew it was just a matter of days before I would own one.

It's obvious that the car is beautiful.  I picked out a blue GT (just couldn't afford the GT-S)  Very stylish and the first 2 months I owned the car, I swear every other person was staring at it.  It's a very new and unique look and it's probably my favorite aspect of the car.  

The 2000 Celica is loaded with features, especially for the price.  Ample CD/cassette stereo system, moonroof, power everything, cruise, etc.  Coming in at around $20,000, it's really a steal.  I love the cockpit style seating, however if your 6'2&quot; or taller, it might be a tight fit.  The back seats aren't the roomiest either, but anyone considering this car probably isn't lugging around too much family.  The hatch offers plenty of space, especially when you retract the back seats.

I love this car, I really do, however all the above does come with a price.  The car is not very fast.  I've never been one that cares too much about this, but to have a car look this sporty and have the lack of power that it does is unfortunate.  It makes sense however when they're able to pack this much car for so little a price, it's because the skimped on the engine.  The car runs beautifully and turns sharply, but off the line and mid range pick up is minimal.  Not the slowest car out there by any means, but don't be revving your engine at any stoplights.  The GTS supposedly packs 20 extra horsepower, so if you've got the extra $2-3,000 go for it.

All in all, this is one sweet ride, and I love climbing in every morning going to work.  I'm still getting those looks to this day.<br><br>
