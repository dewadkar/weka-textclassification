            Before you allow price to have an influence on your car-buying decision, consider these facts about Mercedes Benz: First and foremost, this car will probably outlast YOU.  Durability is its middle name.  Secondly, its dependability narrows the chances of breaking down on some highway in the middle of nowhere practically down to zero. The parts that are put into these machines are made to last a lifetime. Consider how many cars you've bought and sold over the years--most people either sell or trade in a car every five years or so because of problems and repair bills. Now compare that expense to purchasing a car that lasts for decades!  Do the numbers...you'll see that this car is worth every cent. And these cars always hold or increase in value over the years.

Comfort is another huge plus; the seats in  a Mercedes are made to keep your hips and legs from becoming tired over long trips. Think about the seats in other cars --you  seem to be sitting so close to the floorboard that you're practically eating your knees.

Safety is another issue that should always be considered, and Mercedes Benz has always been known for building a safe automobile. Take it from one who knows--eight years ago I was hit from behind by a motorist going 60 miles an hour while I was at a stop light. I was in my 1972 280 SEL (which I still own and is now nearly 30 years old). Both I and the car survived the accident, something that amazed even the police officer on the scene. In fact, his exact comment was, &quot;Had you been in any other type of car, you'd be strumming a harp with Saint Peter right now.&quot;
