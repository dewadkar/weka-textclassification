            Our 1996 Acura Integra has provided me four good years so far. I bought it for its good looks, its low gas mileage, and its performance. 
It is a relatively small car, but it provides good acceleration and gets great mileage (although its tank is somewhat small). The service can get expensive, but we take it to the dealer; Acura claims that its new cars have less rigorous check up requirements. I have had no major problems at all with maintenance. That fact may be the result of careful service. 
After putting 80,000 miles on it in less than four years, I am amazed by how much pep it still has getting on the freeway and passing, although I think it has lost a little bit since it was new. I like the look of the car, especially the twin headlights look. 
Inside, the car has all of the bonuses I was looking for, except that there is no CD player and a new one would cost approximately $500. I would like to have a CD player but that much is just too much. I enjoy the moonroof, the electronic conveniences, and the comfortable driving seat (which is firm, the way I like it). 
Overall, a great car providing excellent performance at a very reasonable price. <br><br>
