            I bought my '99 Blazer in February, 1999, just before we were hit with 12" of snow. What a pleasure it was, and very sure-footed, even on back roads. Surprisingly, my Blazer has a limited-slip differential, but no 4wd.

I bought the 2-door, with the 5 speed manual, in Pewter Metallic, that looks just like the picture at the head of this topic, and I paid less than $18,000, including everything except sales tax. This is about $3,000 less than anything else out there similarly equipped.

A lot of truck for that kind of money. Solid, tight and well-equipped- and a lot of fun to drive. Mine included AM/FM cassette stereo, roof rack, great looking cast aluminum wheels, 4 wheel ABS brakes, automatic lights, etc. all in the base price. I especially like how easily the rear seats fold down, so that my dogs can use the entire rear area to walk around. One pull of the release, and they slide down and forward. No two step process like so many of the imports I looked at.

The interior is a bit plain, but very practical.

My other car is a 93 Lincoln Mark VIII, so I like quiet, powerful and smooth. While the Blazer is not as smooth for a long trip, it definitely is quiet and has plenty of power.  

I understand that Chevy is dropping the base model for '00, and will only offer the Blazer as an LS model, adding a bit to the price. The Blazer will be all new for 2002, but this 99 is still a very solid, reliable vehicle. It is essentially unchanged from about 1996, and the bugs have all been worked out.

UPDATE:
It is now Sept. 2001, and I have put on over 40,000 miles. The Blazer is still very quiet, and I have been to the dealer only to change the oil and rotate tires, and once to check noise in  the fuel pump. They replaced it under warranty. This vehicle has had no quality problems. I still have the original tires, and they still have decent tread. This is amazing to me- and I am not sure whether to credit the Uniroyal Laredo tires, or the Blazer. But this is just another reason to love this vehicle.

My only disappointment is that the sheet metal is thin, and takes very little to dent. Unfortunately, it has a couple of dents in the doors now, from careless parking lot neighbors.
