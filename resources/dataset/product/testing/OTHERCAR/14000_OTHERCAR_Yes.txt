            About a week ago I received an invitation for a �Guest Drive� from Infinity. The invitation contained an incentive � test drive an I35 and get a gift of your choice. One of the choices was a Palm Pilot M100, which is a nice device to have, besides I love cars in general and good cars in particular.

My impression of Infinity cars was that they make reliable cars, which are great from technological standpoint and the company provides excellent warranty and customer service.

The main issue I have with buying an Infinity car is the fact that they look too generic, and I care the way my car looks. I am not saying that the new I35 looks bad, but remove the badge and it is difficult to guess what car this is.

Technologically, Infinity and Nissan are advanced (which can be witnessed by their motorsports program in IRL). Test drive sounded like a good idea, Palm Pilot was a great additional motivator.

<b>Customer Service</b>

I suspect that sales consultants at car dealerships are not all too happy about promotions like this one. After all, majority of people test drive cars to get the free gift promised and the chance to sell them the car is not that great. But the sales rep was very polite. He spent time to show me the car and explain the features and then we went for a test drive.

He let me perform some full-throttle acceleration runs and was honest and admitted that the new G35 (next year) will be more suitable for me. He gave me a couple of coupons for LA Auto Show and advised to go there, look at the competition and decide if I want an Infinity and what model.

<b>Exterior</b>

The car looks quite nice, although a bit too rounded. The wheels are 17� in all trim levels, but are different in finish and tire width (215 mm in standard trim and 225 mm with sport package). The car has fog lights and Xenon HID lights as standard equipment.

<b>Interior</b>

The interior is luxurious and the leather (standard equipment) look great. The car I test-drove had an optional navigation system concealed under the lid in the center portion of the upper part of the dash, and the motorized deployment of it looked cool. The voice instructions it provide are easy to follow.

Navigation system equipped cars have a DVD slot and controls in the dash and a 6-discs CD changer in the trunk. The cars without the navigation system have 6-disc in-dash CD changer. The sound system even has speakers in A-pillars.

The steering wheel and shifter are leather-wrapped (with woodgrain inserts in standard trim level). The steering wheel has controls for radio, trip computer, cruise control. The glove compartment opens slowly and the armrest has two positions. There is a retractable cupholder above the passenger A/C vent, so the beverage can be cooled by the A/C in summer. There are also tow cupholders in front of the center armrest.

There is enough space in the cabin and the leg space for rear passengers is sufficient, however the headroom space is limited and seems less that in my Mitsubishi Galant, probably because of the sunroof. The �Sunroof And Sunshade� package add sunroof and rear motorized sunshade and this package is <b>required</b> if you want to get any other package, be it �Sport Package�, Navigation system or cold weather package.

The instrument cluster is absolutely dark with the ignition off, but when you start the car, the instruments appear and are highly legible. The car is equipped with the trip computer that shows MPG, average speed, elapsed time, distance to empty and outside temperature. The rearview mirror has small display for compass.

The car has power mirrors, doors and seats (two settings for the driver seat are remembered), remote trunk and fuel door release. The security system, front and side airbags, seatbelts with pretensioners and active headrests provide safety. The traction control system can be turned on and off with a switch just right of the steering wheel.

The car has automatic climate control (for some reason located below the stereo) and a signature Infinity analog clock in the upper middle of the dash.

<b>Test Drive</b>

Since the car has front-wheel drive, I expected torque steer and it was there, although not too much of it. On the freeway onramp, when two lanes merge into one, I decided to test the 255 hp 3.5L V6 engine of I35 and pass several cars. When I floored it, there�s been a moment of fight between me and the torque steer. I won :-)

For those who doesn�t know, the torque steer is when the change in traction causes the steering wheel to �get the life of its own� and try to turn by itself. It happens in front-wheel-drive cars when the traction is uneven. It is hard to tell if I won the battle with the torque steer or it was the traction control, probably both.

The engine is quite smooth and quiet at low RPMs, but makes reasonably loud noise at full throttle, and the noise it makes doesn�t sound refined. But the acceleration is great and the engine features impressive technology and warranty as well as low maintenance.

The engine uses timing chain instead of the belt, so it doesn�t need replacement and the double-platinum-tipped spark plugs allow for 100,000-mile tune-up intervals.

The ride (with standard suspension) wasn�t harsh, but I could feel vibration from the uneven surface, which makes me wonder how the stiffer sport suspension would handle it. The brakes are great, although a bit too sensitive. The space between the brake pedal and gas is too small though.

The car is supposed to consume 20 MPG in city and 26 on the highway, but with my spirited driving the trip computer showed 8.6 MPG. The 18.5-gallon fuel tank is a nice thing to have.

<b>Conclusion</b>

<I>The new I35 has some serious power and good handling. The feature set is impressive and the interior is luxurious. But the car seems too �generic� and lacks personality. If it is no problem for you, I can recommend the I35. It has good dynamics, nice interior, great warranty and service.</I>
