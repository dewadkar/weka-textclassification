            I bought this camera used on Ebay. I have taken some really good pictures with it. Some which are being published in a book.  I really do like this camera. It is very easy to use and you do not have to read the manual to figure it out. I will state the pros and cons of the camera.

PROS:
Easy to use
Uses cheap compact flash cards
Uses AA batteries (I recommend using rechargeables)
Has an LCD screen
Takes really good quality pictures up to the size of 5"x7" when you are close to the object/subject that is in the picture

CONS:
Comes with a serial cable to transfer pictures 
Drains batteries
Looks kind of cheap
Pictures are really good only if you are about three feet away
You have to wait several seconds after taking a picture until you can take another one
Accessories are expensive
Software could be a lot better

THINGS I RECOMMEND BUYING/USING FOR THIS CAMERA:
rechargeable batteries 
spare set of rechargeable batteries
compact flash card
USB compact flash card reader
high quality photo editing software
