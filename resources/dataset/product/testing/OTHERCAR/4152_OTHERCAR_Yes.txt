            I have had my 1995 Isuzu Rodeo for a little under a year, and I have to say I have little or no complaints.  Considering the mileage of the Rodeo when I got it, it has performed super.

<b>Cost</b>- Of course this depends on how good a deal you can get, but I believe I got a bargain on mine for $8,000.  I know that sounds like I ripped someone off, but the mileage was a bit much I would say.  I was the second owner, and when I got the car it had over 165,000 miles on it, must have been a journeyman! (5 stars out of 5)

<b>Comfort</b>- This car is very spacious, and you can easily fit 5 people if not more.  The leg room is ample to say the least.  You also have plenty of room in the back to stash whatever you want, which makes it great for trips. (4 stars out of 5)

<b>Looks</b>- My Rodeo is a lighter shade of green, and after a good wash, it makes the car look much more like a 97 model.  I like the way the whole car is designed, and it is just a sharp looking car. (5 stars out of 5)

<b>Durability</b>- My thought is that the Rodeo can last a lot, considering it has lasted well over 170,000 miles (that is including my mileage I added).  My Rodeo is 4 wheel drive, and can sustain a lot.  It can effectively get you in and out of most situations. (5 stars out of 5)

<b>Mechanically</b>- With all cars, you are due to have some problems.  However, with a car that has over 170,000 miles and is 5 years old, is due to have more problems.  I would have to say though, the 1995 Rodeo has exceeded my expectations.  I expected to have some problems, and I have had just a couple with the transmission and that is it.  Everything else works fine and it seems that it will continue to.  The engine has lasted well, and still runs fine. (4 stars out of 5)

<b>Gas Mileage</b>- Most SUV's are not top notch, when it comes to gas mileage, and the Rodeo is no exception.  The gas mileage is average, nothing more, nothing less.  Some of this accounts to me living near a city, and not driving on the interstate as much.  Nonetheless, the gas mileage is average. (3 stars out of 5)

<b>Handling</b>- The Rodeo handles well, and that is about all I can say about that.  There is not much roll, when you corner. (4 stars out of 5)

<b>Smooth Ride</b>- I have sounds that I rather not hear occur, every once in a while but not too often.  The engine is not loud, but it is not a mute either, it has its share of noise.  Inside the car you can hear the wind and so forth on the interstate, making the ride a little bit louder.  The only other complaint I have is that when you have the air conditioning on it makes a sliding, watery noise.  Besides that, the ride is average. (3 stars out of 5)  

<b>Overall</b>- When I bought this car last year, considering its age and mileage, I expected to run into some problems, which I have, but far less than I expected.  The Rodeo has impressed me, and if I had to chance to buy a newer Isuzu (Rodeo or Trooper) I would. (4 stars out of 5)
