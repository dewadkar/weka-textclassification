            The S 500 surprised me as I took it for a civil ride out to the country and then let it rip on the open, winding road. I had driven the CLK 320 a few days ago and I found myself saying, "this monster rivals the handling of the CLK." It did, with relatively tight handling as I leaned into my curves and accelerated out of them. The optional sport mode did make a small bit of difference by lowering the car considerably, but it handles fine outside sport mode. Because of the S 500's naturally heavy and solid ride, I felt as though I wasn't even on the ground when cruising down the straightaways. 

The cabin is extremely spacious, which one comes to expect from the evolution of this model. But the amenities are endless, with heated and cooled seats, user friendly navigation, Mercedes' ESP memory system, which digitally adapts the car to a specific driving style, and more. Seats give good lateral and lumbar support. The new dash deviates from the traditional box and stiff Mercedes style, but not for the worse, FOR THE BETTER!

Cargo space is plentiful in the trunk and, of course, in the back seat. headroom is not a problem. But the only disappointment was the combination of tires and rims, which do not really compliment the rest of this beautiful car. The tires are too far inside the wheel base; and they are not wide enough, which gives the bottom of the car a little bit of a goofy look from some angles. The rims are too plastic-like and a cheap for this car. Otherwise, The S 500 meets my standards.
