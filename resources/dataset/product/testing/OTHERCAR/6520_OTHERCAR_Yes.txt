            First of all, I basically like this car a lot.   I have the wagon and my husband has the sedan.   The seats are very comfortable.  The special child locks in the back and the built in booster seat were the main factors along with the seat comfort of my selling my lovely Mercedes wagon to get the Volvo one.  I just found that I preferred driving my husband's Volvo so I got one too.   Mechanically, the car has been wonderful.  We;ve done all scheduled maintenance and have had no problems.   I also love the way this car drives (as compared to the 850 models).   Excellent turning radius!   Also, like that almost everything is standard- relatively few options- making it much easier to get an idea of good value in the used market and price compare. 

The bad:  little things (usually electric related)- tend to &quot;break&quot; and drive you nuts.  The lock on a seat belt, a window will malfunction or a door lock will break.... that type of thing. 

Overall.  I do love this car.... <br><br>
