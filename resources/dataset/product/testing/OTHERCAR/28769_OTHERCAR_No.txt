            We feel in love with this car on the test drive. It had 78000 miles on it when purchased. The repair bills have surpassed the purchase price in the 10 months of driving this car. The brakes, transmission, heater core, air conditioning, paint falling off, radio speakers and antenna, have been fixed. Things still needing repair, are, the door locks don't lock, horn don't honk, gas tank body cover won't open, cruise control don't work. Several mechanics have said it will be a short time before it needs head gaskets and air suspension repairs, costing possibly $2000. Last week it was 101 degrees, the vinyl on the dash exploded in a half dozen places, now the interior looks terrible.
