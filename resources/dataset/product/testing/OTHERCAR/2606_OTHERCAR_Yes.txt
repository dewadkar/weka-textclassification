            The 99 Maxima is a joyous automobile.  After carefully evaluating over a dozen four door cars before my purchase, I was greatly disturbed to learn that the performance and feel of every single car tested was lousy.... Until I drove the Maxima.  

That which separates the Maxima from the other four door autos tested was the crispness and consistency of the following features:

1.  The powerplant:  sharp, responsive, smooth and with punch unseen in the vast majority of larger sedans.
2.  Suspension:  The SE edition car handles like a small sports car.  Very little roll and a very fine comprimise between the harsh ride of a sport and the posh of a cruiser.  
3. Interior comfort:  firm and well built.  A clear winner over the others tested.
4.  The stereo:  This won it for me.  The Bose system is a scream.  It makes me play it loud.  I went out and bought CDs from the 80's.  Unbelievable!

I am not overly enamored with the appearance of the car but in general it is a head turner.  Without question, when you blow past someone on a busy road, it is indeed a head turner.  Fast and it looks like it.  

Comfort??  For the driver, it is very good.  Long trips in the back seat, maybe for little people.  For a 250 pounder, maybe not so comfortable.  The japanese still don't have a solid appreciation for vehicles that address the larger people needs.  The seats are firm and well made.  The interior ergonomics are very good except for the cruise control.  The on/off switch that must be activated before it can be used is stupid.  The engineering staff responsible for that were simply too conservative and need to look at the GM cruise systems.  Stereo controls are the best.  Seat warmers are terriffic.  The temperature sensor for the automatic climate control is on the dash where the sunlight can impinge incidently resulting in a dramatically erroneous reading on a cold but sunny winter day.  The result is a cold car without resorting to manual control.  

Reliability??  Very good.  Only one problem in 15K miles and 1.5 years.   Somewhere in the umpteen airbag system, a wireing anomoly was detected resulting in a repetetive flash on the dash.  An apparent quick fix under warranty.  Otherwise, flawless.  Compared to my previous Chevy Blazer, it is perfect.

Buy this car if you want a reliable, fast and flashy car that makes you happy when you drive it.  Don't buy this car if you like the &quot;big&quot; feel of American sedans or if you weigh over 200 pounds.  Tall is ok, but big guys don't like it.  If you like loud music with precision reproduction; definatly consider it.  <br><br>
