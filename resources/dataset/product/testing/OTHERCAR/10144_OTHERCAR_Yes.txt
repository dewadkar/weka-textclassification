            2000 Pathfinder SE (Sierra Silver)&quot;exact as commercial&quot;

Being from northern Canada my wife and I needed an reliable
vehicle for the winter and for all the highway driving we do.
This winter we had over a foot of snow a couple of times, my 
path cut through it like a hot knife through butter.

At our cottage near the Muskoka's I have put my 
path to the test also. Extremley steep inclines and deep mud has
never been so enjoyable. Originally I wanted a Grand Cherokee (a very hansome)SUV. But if you research the massive recall lists and poor reliability records it's disappointing.

I love the handling on the road especially, it's very similar 
to riding in a comfortable luxury sedan, nice and tight. The 
quiet ride accompanied by the sweet BOSE stereo system is 
nothing less than spectacular. Although I don't have the 250 
horsepower engine, 170 horses gets me where I need to go no 
problem. And is probably more fuel effecient. Driving an SUV
isn't about acceleration and top end speed.

The only complaint I have is that Nissan should seriously 
change the rather &quot;bland&quot; interior.

If you are looking for comfort, good road handling, excellent snow
perfomance and a great warranty go with a path. I'm 29, but I would
recommend the Pathfinder to any age.
