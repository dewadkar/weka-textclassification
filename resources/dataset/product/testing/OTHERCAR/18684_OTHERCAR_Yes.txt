    I bought my Olympus C-2000 in 1999, when it was the state of the art. Since then, it has been superseded by the C-3000 3 megapixel camera.  I had owned an Olympus film camera before and was pleased with its features.  I've been very pleased with its image quality so far, a hallmark of Olympus cameras.

     The good things about the Olympus C-2000: 

     * Image quality.  A common statement is that a 2 megapixel camera can turn out photo prints that equal film for clarity at about 4x6 print size.  I have printed pictures from this that are pretty close to film on an entire 8 1/2 x 11 sheet of photo paper (on a 4-year-old HP 722C).  The quality of the images are simply great.  My in-laws have an HP 930C, which has turned out slightly better quality prints as well. 

     * Image size.  I usually shoot in 1024x768 mode, and the larger size makes for easier tweaking of images.  It's much easier to make a big photo smaller than it is to make a small photo big.  Making a small photo big often results in image degradation.

     * Remote control.  This is a feature my Olympus film camera had.  It's not something I use often, but when I need it, it's nice to have.    It makes it easy to get in the shot yourself and not be counting down until a self-timer fires.  (The C-2000 also comes with this feature as well.) 

      * Electronic viewfinder.  It's not an exact match to what the actual picture will be like, but it's close.  This is very handy for taking photographs, particularly of a wiggly 10-month-old.

      *Digital and optical zoom.  The optical zoom works pretty much like any zoom camera you may have operated.  The digital zoom allows you to move in further, useful for shooting faraway subjects.  Digital zoom does automatically put the camera into 640x480 mode -- not the end of the world, but something I would like to see taken care of in later models.   


The bugs of the C-2000 are mostly livable and can be dealt with in some ways.  Here's what they are: 

      * Battery eater.  With flash and electronic viewfinder on, the C-2000 eats batteries like Life Savers.  Remember the ad for Rayovac batteries where the small electronic device ran around saying "Batteries!  More batteries!" (until it was stopped by Michael Jordan wielding Rayovac batteries)?  That's how this camera is.  I invested in three sets of rechargeable batteries in order to keep this thing running.  But it will drain Duracells and Energizers dry relatively quickly.  When I bought the camera, Olympus was offering a free set of NiMH batteries and a charger on a mail-in deal.  Good thing, and too bad they're not still doing it. 

      * Power button placement.  There isn't too much you can do about this. It's easy to hit the power button and shut off the camera instead of take the picture.  I have learned to warn people about this before letting them take pictures with the camera.  
 
      * Parallel cable.  This means slow downloads.  The camera must be put into download mode in order to download pictures, and the parallel cable can take forever.  Olympus offers this camera with their own software capable of downloading the pictures.  Still, more batteries were sacrificed in downloading the camera (usually because you forget to turn it off) than in the actual taking of pictures.  I eventually solved this problem by buying a SmartMedia card reader for $30, which allowed much faster downloads because it was USB.  Much faster and much better results.  


   All in all, the Olympus is definitely worth looking at.  It has enough in common with its film-using cousins that people can be easily taught to use it for simple snapshots.  Learning the camera's other modes and methods of operation isn't terribly difficult, and the image quality is great -- perhaps not film, but it's pretty close.
