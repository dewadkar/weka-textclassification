            <b>Most men will admit going shopping with your girlfriend is not the most fun in the world.</b>  Shopping for a new car with your girlfriend is probably the worst.  Getting to the drive the car that she is paying for is the next best thing to Heaven.

(This is in Epinions 2000 category for lack of a proper home.  Epinions informs me they don�t want to go with the 2001 class because GMC hasn�t paid them for advertsing yet.  The drop down box states 2001 but Epinions hasn't changed it yet.   ;( )

After three dealerships and the pricing runaround I was ready to call it quits.  Our pursuit for a 2001 GMC Yukon was nothing more then snake oil salesmen, ridiculous pricing and waiting lists.  Then it happened!  I was pulled away from a football-induced nap and was told by my girlfriend that we were definitely going to make the purchase this time.

<b>Fast Forward</b>
The Yukon is the mother of all SUVs.  My new play toy is so intense I don�t know where to start.  Four dealerships, a trade-in and a payment later and we are sitting pretty.

<b>The Look</b>
The GMC Yukon SLT is truly a beautiful vehicle.  Not being a fan of most American cars and having a fair amount of exposure to SUVs I�ll plead my ignorance now.  Prior to this purchase, I had been a fixture in my friend�s Yukon Denali and though that was all the rage but the Yukon brings some weight of its own.

The first impression you gather is HUGE!  The Yukon dwarfed the 4 Runner that we brought for trade in.  The curvaceous yet robust body style had me a little cautious yet excited.  Save for an occasional turn behind the wheel in the Denali the closest big truck I had driven prior to this sported the words U-Haul on the side.

Equipped with monster tires, tinted glass, running boards and a luggage rack I was ready to take the beast through its paces.  Should I mention the most exciting feature of the exterior are the �puddle lamps� that project light down to your feet from the wing mirrors.

<b>The Inside</b>
It takes a little big step to get inside the GMC Yukon.  Once you do you are greeted by new smelling, supple leather.  The Yukon fits 8 comfortably in the second and third row �flip and fold� seats.  Dual side air bags are standard for this big rig.  The amenities are plenty with 9 speakers, front and rear air conditioning, automatic climate control, rear seat audio and the OnStar communications system.  The OnStar operator will even tell any potential thief to get out of the car because they are currently being tracked!

<b>The Drive</b>
Feels like a Cadillac but it�s not.  The GMC Yukon is smooth with its automatic transmission.  For a big rig it sure gets off the line fast.  The drive is smooth and effortless and I can assure you that others get out of your way.  

Our Yukon is equipped with a Vortec 5300 (5.3 liter) V8.  Tis four speed, two wheel drive has plenty of punch in the city and floats like a butterfly across the freeway.  Be forewarned though that it is a gas guzzler - 14 miles per gallon city and 18 miles per gallon highway.  Needless to say we turn the engine off when we go through the Taco Bell drive thru.  The annual estimated fuel cost is $1351.  

<b>My New Girl</b>
It�s great to have a girlfriend who will share me with another woman.  She doesn�t get jealous of my appreciation for the GMC Yukon and the best part about is that she�s making the payments.  It�s a threesome that no man can complain about.  

We have only had our GMC Yukon for less then a week now.  We even make up excuses to go drive it because it is such a joy.  Oh, life without children.  ;)  I can�t tell you how thrilled I am to have this Yukon as part of my life.  We are looking forward to future road trips up the California coast and even nights out chauffeuring our friends in our newest toy.  If you are even thinking about this class of monster SUV the Yukon deserves a look � first and last.    <br><br>
