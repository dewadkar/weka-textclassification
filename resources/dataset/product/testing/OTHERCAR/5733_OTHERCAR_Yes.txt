            I am eighteen and of course the first thing I wanted when I got my license is a car.  My parents said as soon as my dad bought a new one, I could have which ever remaining car I wanted.  I am glad I picked the Acclaim!  She (Brown Sugar) still runs like a champ, after almost nine years.  The air conditioner and heat both work great and only takes a minute to warm up.  The car has a lot of power and good pick-up. The cruise control is great and very helpful on long trips.  The back seat is roomy, and can easily fit a toddler seat and two people.  The car is very comfortable. Whenever we go some where, my friends and family want me to drive because the car is so roomy.  The trunk space is good, although not as good as brand new cars.  The car handles good and she can take pot-holes and curbs pretty good.  It is a nice family car, but also it is a good car for a new driver or a teenager.  It is very low maintenance and it takes a beatin' and keeps on tickin'! <br><br>
