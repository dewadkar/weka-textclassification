            Reliability -
I bought this vehicle with 36,000 miles in 1996 and it now has 112,000 miles.  During these 76,000 miles I have performed the following maintenance:

1) Changed the engine oil every 4,000-6,000 miles.
2) Kept all fluids full.
3) Lubed Joints every 8,000-18,000 miles.
4) New pads and rotors for front brakes at 90,000 miles.
5) New timing belt at 90,000 miles.

Two items have broken during this period.

1) Handle fell off the engine hood release.  The rod has a groove in it for the plastic molded handle that broke.  I just use a screwdriver in the groove to open the hood.
2) The automatic windows quit working due to a wire breaking from fatigue in the door hinge area.  I spliced the wire and everything works fine.

The bottom line is I have done the minimum necessary maintenance and have had no significant problems with this vehicle.  I do take a look at the differential, transmission, and other fluids but they always look new, so I have not changed any since I have owned the Cherokee.

Performance - 
This V8 engine gets up and goes.  I constantly have it off roads and it seems to go anywhere.  It is also very comfortable to travel in.  My model has the adjustable seats that are awesome.  I can drive 500 miles and feel great.  I can't go more than 100 in my Honda Civic.

Safety - 
I have had only one experience here.  My wife wrecked the Cherokee a year ago.  The other car involved in the collision was totaled but the Cherokee's bumper took almost all of the impact load.  Everyone at the scene was convinced in purchasing a Grand Cherokee after they compared the vehicles.

I recommend the Grand Cherokee with a V8 engine, all time 4WD.  Expect 16-19 miles per gallon average.
