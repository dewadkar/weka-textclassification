            For me, this is the perfect car.  First, it really moves.  You will surprise a lot of people during the stoplight challenge (a lot of people with more expensive cars!).  This car is quick.  

Aside from the engine and turbo (which everyone talks about) there are a lot of other nice features, or rather lack of annoying features.  A lot of new cars add all this annoying crap that Subaru chose not to impose on the WRX.  The car doesn't nag at you if you don't buckle your seatbelt, it doesn't lock the doors on you automatically, it doesn't have seatbelts that move around on some dumb track.  The default alarm is silent, in that it won't annoy people when you park it somewhere and a squirrel jumps on the hood.  Everyone knows loud alarms do nothing but embarrass the owners who forget how to deactivate them.  The silent alarm is much nicer.

Aside from that, the car is really pretty and the AWD will be a wintertime lifesaver.  It would be nice if they offered a sunroof as an option, but on the other hand this car is too mean for a sunroof.  The rear legroom is pretty crappy if you're tall, but is comparable to cars in it's class.  I get the sticker on gas mileage... about 24mpg.  Too bad it uses the expensive gas!  The front bucket seats are fantastic.  There is a little road noise on the highway.
