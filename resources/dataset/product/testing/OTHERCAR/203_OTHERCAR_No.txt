            I recently purchased a 2000 Isuzu Rodeo and for the most part I like it except for the constant vibration in the steering wheel while driving at highway speeds. I have owned this truck for one month and it has been back to the dealership two times and I am taking it back for a third time for the vibration. Isuzu offers the worst customer service I have ever seen. The lack of concern shocked me greatly. Calling Isuzu was a total waist of time and now I am frustrated even further. At this point I have been told that since they have had so many complaints from other consumers about this very same problem, they feel that is how the truck is supposed to handle. I will not recommend this vehicle to anyone I know due partly to the poor customer service. I know that I am going to have a battle on my hands trying to get this problem fixed. Please test drive this truck at highway speeds before buying and make sure that you have weighed all of your options for a better SUV. <br><br>
