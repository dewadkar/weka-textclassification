            My experience with the Toyota Rav4 began before I even had my full drivers license. Somewhere in my early teenage years one of my parents had promised me the car of my choice (within reason) when i got my license.However,when it actually came time to for me to learn to drive, I had a horrible time. I was attempting to learn on my mother's big, ugly mini-van and I just couldn't seem to do it. Thus, my parents decided to go ahead and buy my car so i'd have it to learn on and take my test with. 

This started an incredibly long and drawn out process. My parents first gave me a list of what I couldn't have (ie. anything that even remotely resembled a sports car)and a list of what they thought I should get (ie. cars that resemble tanks.)After much test-driving and argument, it came down between two things: I wanted a jeep and my parents wanted me to get a camry or a corolla. since they were paying, it was pretty much up to them. 

On the day that we went to the toyota dealership to do a final test-drive of a camry, i just happened to notice the solitary Rav4 sitting off in the corner of the lot. I asked the salesguy what it was he talked me into test-driving it. 

I loved this car from the very start. The second I got behind the wheel, I knew it was the perfect car for me. It drives like a small car, but is high enough off the ground so that I feel just as secure as I would in a larger SUV.

The interior is just to my liking. It is very comfortable, even on long road trips. I have all of the luxuries that anyone could possibly want (cd player, automatic door locks, power windows, etc.), but a very simple interior that suits my tastes perfectly. 

I've had the car for about 3 years now and I still have people ask me if it's new. I've driven half-way across the country several times and driven over many mountain roads that don't deserve the name of road. I've been through 2 rather nasty wrecks (neither of which was my fault, i might add) and after some body work, the car was still drives as if it were new. 

The small size of the Rav4 is useful if you live in a city with narrow streets and bad drivers as I do. I've avoided many wrecks due simply to the size and agility of my car.

The only major problem that I have with the car is the lack of storage/hauling space. Though it is rarely a problem for me, I could see it causing issues if one was taking a trip with a lot of luggage or was trying to buy a refrigerator or something like that. 

**Update**
Since I wrote this review, I managed to wreck this car for  third and final time and no loner have it. I think, however, that the nature of my wreck is proof that this is a great car. I t-boned another car at about 55 mph (The fool started to pull out in front of me and then thought better of it and stopped--too bad they were already out in the road!!)It was totally not my fault and I definitely got the worse end of the deal. It was a nasty looking wreck and my car was well beyond repair. However bad the outside looked, the inside looked as if the car hadn't been touched.  It was the sort of wreck where I could have easily been seriously injured or even killed and I walked away perfectly fine except for  couple of bruises. I definitely think that the quality of the Rav 4 is to thank for this.
