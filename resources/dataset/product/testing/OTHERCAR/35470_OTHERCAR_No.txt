            The Sony DSC-F707 Cybershot is one of the new 5 megapixel resolution cameras.

This view is from an amateur's point of view.  I find the Sony DSC-F707 a little hard to use.  My son-in-law has a Nikon D1X, and except for the battery life, I like a lot better.

From what I have read and seen digital cameras from Sony often perform the same functions in very different ways, and are often very different in design.  This makes switching from one kind of Sony to the other very difficult.  Of course, you could always read the directions, but that would be against the rules, now wouldn't it.  

Sony uses the now almost obsolete 1.44 MB floppy disc, and CD for storage.  In my opinion, they should change to Compact Flash because it has the ability to store large TIFF and RAW files.Smart Media is a better choice for people who need less capacity but still want the same kinds of speed and performance as the Compact Flash offers.  Sony can also offer both choices o their clients as do Olympus and Fugi.

The idea of having full control and being proprietary is just not going to work in this.  The Sony Memory Stick holds fewer images than a 12 exposure roll of 35mm film.

The Memory Sticks are also expensive.  This can dramatically off set the lower price of the camera.  I find that going and buying Memory Sticks has become a considerable expense for using my camera.

I have heard a lot of people complain about the view finder, my son-in-law included. I think it is just fine for my needs.  I am not a professional, so I don't know what their needs are, but I know this fills my needs.

The Carl Zeiss lens is cumbersome and off balance.  It does have a six blade iris diaphram which I think creates a better image.

I really like the NightShot and NightFrame AE modes.  They both allow pictures to be taken in the dark.  NightFramewith flash, and NightShot without.  The images are not great on NightShot.  They kind of look like something off of SciFi, but it is a beat feature.

The battery, when fully charged, lasts me right around 3.5 hours.  This is an amazing feat from what I have seen from other digital cameras.My son-in-law's Nikon doesn't last nearly this long.  There is also an LCD display that lets you see exactly how much power you have left.

I have not yet mastered this camera, but I keep reading about it, and working with it.  I just find, as an amateur, that it is a little more complex than I probably would have wanted.  

I do really like the picture quality, and the digital quality.  I guess this purchase was just a little over my head.
