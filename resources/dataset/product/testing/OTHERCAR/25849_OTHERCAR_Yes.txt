            My husband bought me a 2000 Jeep Cherokee Limited 2wd for my birthday 11/99.

I just had a baby and she and I enjoy tooling around town in our new Jeep.  SUV has quick pickup which I love. Roomy front. Nice radio/cd system &amp; the sunroof is an excellent feature.  I really enjoy the truck space. It is easy to put things in. I can fit a large stroller, groceries, junk, &amp; it has a cover to hide all of it.  I also enjoy that you can put rear seats down if you need the extra space.

Her rear-facing car seat fits perfect in the back seat.

The ride in the back seat can be a little rough if the driver drives like my husband around corners.

Gas mileage is avg 15-16 mph.

But overall, I highly recommend for low cost, highly comfortable, attractive suv.<br><br>
