            I own a 1996 White Corvette convertible with black top and grey interior, I bought it in May of 1996, I was trading a Corvette coupe 1993, ruby anniversary edition. 
First bought the 1993 to fulfill a long time dream of owning one, well I loved it so much that in 1996 I decided to trade it in for a 96 convertible I was given a decent trade-in value which made the decision easier to make(sticker on the 96 was $48,000).
I love this car greatly my wife uses it daily for a short commute to work and I'll use it on week-ends weather permitting.

Pros. 
1- Fast, real fast got it up to 150 mph and there was still power left.
2- Great for riding with the top down, which goes up and down with relative ease.
3- Hey, a clean vette will always make heads turn.
4- Considering size of motor and all it is very good on gas, i'll average from 17 mpg in town to 24/25 mpg on the highway.
5- Damn does this sucker handle well on the road, those tires just eat the pavement at any speed, You know that is a disguised racing machine when you take an interstate exit at 60+ mph and the tires don't even squeel.

Cons:
1- Although fairly comfortable for this class of car(I'm 6' and 280#) it could be better (the C-5 is much better) and let's be reasonnable here in this class of sport car none of it's competition is better I know I used to own a Ferrari 308 GTS which was terrible comfort wise. 
2- I went to trade it for a 2000 millenium yellow Vette I was surprise to be told that I was only offered $26,000 on a trade in
3- the 96 convertible has no trunck which can be a hassle 
4- Service can somewhat be expensive $ 60.00 for oil change, but then again it's a $ 46,000 Vette not a $ 15,000 Toyota.
5- Don't buy this car if you are looking for a car that you will drive you cross country in plush seats, your butt will hurt in 4 hours.

Would I buy an other Vette: In a heart beat
Would I recommend a Vette: Without a doubt
Do I love my Vette: You bet<br><br>
