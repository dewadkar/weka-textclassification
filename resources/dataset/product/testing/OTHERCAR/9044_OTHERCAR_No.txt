            I sell theses Kia Sportages. These particular vehicles are not as bad as the little sister vehicle the Sephia.  However, you get what you pay for.  This vehicle is the lowest priced SUV on the market.  It's light and agile, But Very under-powered. The 2.0L DOHC engine is just screaming to let go and blow up under the hood when the smallest of pedal is applied.  I guess the thinking behind that is a larger more capable engine would increase the cost to the customer.  Perhaps if the engine compartment had more insulation around it we would not have to raise our voice to hear in the passenger compartment when applying the gas.  But again.. You get what you pay for.  This vehicle is for people that can't afford a real SUV like a Jeep Cherokee or Ford Explorer. You better have really good credit too, because banks do not like to loan out on Kia's for simple fact the vehicle depreciates so much.  Kia does have one thing I can say is a great innovation.  It is the only vehicle in its class to have knee airbags which deploy under the steering column and protect. It has, of course, standard dual airbags as well. The 5 year 60K power-train warranty is nice too.    <br><br>
