            Im a 27 year old female and i own a 1990 Jeep Cherokee i inherited this Jeep in 1997.It had 107,00 miles on it when i got it and it now has 122,00.It passes smog tests with flying colors.It is a v-6 engine 4.0 liter 4x4.It climbs the hills smoothly with little effort.The only work i have had done other than routine oil changes is replace the alternator belt and a few hoses.It runs quiet as a mouse and rides smoothly.The noise from the outside is kept to a minimum.It is fully loaded with leather power seats and am/fm cassette.I am not at all worried about long trips or the reliability of this jeep at all.I have taken it to Los Angeles wich is 450 miles away from me and to Lake Tahoe and Reno and they are over 100 miles away and also to the Redwoods camping.It holds 5 passengers comfortably.There is alot of room for storage in the back and the roof rack on top just doubles the storage capacity.I would recommend a Jeep Cherokee to anyone with an active lifestyle that enjoys the outdoors.It is stylish it looks good going down the road it is smooth driving, comfortable and powerful reliable engine.<br><br>
