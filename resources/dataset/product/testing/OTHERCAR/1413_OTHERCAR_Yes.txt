            For my 16th birthday, I got the ultimate 16 year old present...a car.  Not just any car, mind you, a brand spankin' new 1998 Dodge Neon.  I've had the car for almost 3 years now, and it has served me extremely well.

My model came pretty stripped down (Mom and Dad didn't want to spend TOO much); no automatic windows/locks, automatic, no cruise control.  I got the four-door model, since insurance would be lower.

The Neon has served my purposes extremely well.  I'm a high school student, but I'm not big into the whole &quot;ooo, look at MY car!&quot; thing.  I just needed a car to get me from point A to point B efficiently and easily, and the Neon did just that.  It's fun to drive (Mom tries to steal it from me from time to time) and gets pretty nice gas mileage...definitely a good thing considering gas prices now.  I laugh at my friends and their camaros with 17 mpg, if they're lucky.  I think the last time I figured the gas mileage, it was around 27-30 mpg.  

The car handles really well, and I've had no problems whatsoever with the engine or anything, only a couple of flat tires which had nothing to do with the manufacturing.  There was one really weird thing that happened, though, that nobody I know has ever really heard of.  It was a one of those days where it's really cool in the morning and suddenly heats up really quickly around midday (I live in the South).  Apparently, the inside of the car was airtight, because all of a sudden the rear window just busted out.  It was the weirdest thing I had ever seen.  But other than that, I have had no problems with my Neon.

All in all, if you need a good, efficient car that's fun to drive and has a lot of room for carrying friends and luggage and groceries and stuff, you can't go wrong with the Neon.  <br><br>
