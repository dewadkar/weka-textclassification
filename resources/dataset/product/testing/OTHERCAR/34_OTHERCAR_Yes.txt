            ....first car, that is. What did you think I was going to say, first love? Bah.

My first car was a 1984 Buick Regal LTD. What a car. Huge, relatively powerful, cushy seats, soft ride, cavernous trunk (tons o' room for my guitars and amps), and a commanding road presence. I was 17 years old when I paid $2000 for it in 1994. Has it been that long? *sniff*

Before this turns into a trip down memory lane, onto the car. As I said, it is a land yacht. And back then, it was considered a midsize car. Sheesh. The springs were so soft, I would bounce for a week if I hit one little bump. No wonder the mouth-breathers in my high school called it "The Tank."

If you are considering buying one of these used, to save some bucks, you certainly can, but be careful. This car got to me school, work, band practice, and all the parties every time it was called on, but it did give me some mechanical trouble. It was 10 years old at the time, but I have an 11 year old Honda which performs flawlessly. First, the A/C went, right around June 1st. Alllllrighty. So I drove around with the windows down. Then it began running hot. I installed a new thermostat and flushed the radiator, and it ran fine, then I was driving my then-girlfriend home one day and it literally belched its coolant all over the street. The whole radiator exploded, so I replaced it. Soon, it came time for me to leave for college. This is when the transmission started to shift erratically. Speaking with a mechanic friend revealed that the total cost of a transmission job would be greater then the value of the car. You can see where this is going. I agreeably parted with my first ride a year after I got it. What a short, strange trip.
