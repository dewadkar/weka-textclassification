            I purchased the top of the line V-6 trim. This car did not disappoint me in the least! It responds well, looks great, and has basically all the features that higher end luxury cars have. 
  The new audio and climate controls are well designed, as are the on-wheel buttons. Purchased this car in December, and have had absolutely no problems with driving. The front seats are comfortable and easily adjusted, and have side and side-curtain airbags. The back seats are surprisingly comfortable and accessible for a coupe. They also have side-impact bags, which is the main reason we chose this trim over the others. There is plenty of leg and head room to go around, A tall person would feel fine in the front and only slightly cramped in the back, nothing major. The trunk space is more than adequate.
  Safety was the most important factor, and Honda's reputation combined with the features on this car placed it ahead of other cars considered. This generation is probably the safest Accord yet made, and the coupe is nearly as safe as its sedan counterpart (only the lowered weight makes any difference, the doors are well-reinforced to counter the extra length in between columns). Braking and handling is quick and responsive. The V-6 engine is very powerful, maybe a bit too over-powered like the other new cars in this class (but that's a personal preference). The ride is very quiet, usually the only noise comes from the road, not the wind or engine.
