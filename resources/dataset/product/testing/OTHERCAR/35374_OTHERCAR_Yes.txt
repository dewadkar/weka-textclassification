                 Well, I'll start with my own personal tragedy.
         
       MY BABY IS IN THE SHOP!
 
    I blew the engine on my car....Don't worry, she'll be back.



        So anyway, not that you cared about that.
 I'll start with the bad aspects of the Acura Integra:


     The distributor that came in these cars is nothing short of garbage.I had to get mine replaced and in the process, my mechanic informed me that the car is notorious for it's terrible part. Look at spending around $350 for a new one.

     Also it could have came with 15'" rims instead of the 14"'s.   Handling is adequate, but 15"'s would give it a nice sure-footed feel at high speeds around the bends.

 
      Interior noise is a tad too much for me. No it's not terrible but it could have been more buffered.

    A six speed, I feel would have also been a nice touch. Highway cruising with the 5 is good, but a 6 would have relieved the strained sound of the motor and improve gas milage a bit.



       Now for the good news:


      The car is a fun to drive. The DOHC makes me look forward to hitting 4 grand. I can feel the power immediately.  No, this car CAN NOT beat a Mustang (stock or otherwise) and anyone who has a stock Integra and says it can is either crazy or lucked out by pulling up next to a 5.0 who had a driver who had no idea how to drive it. I
took my car to the track and the best she ran was low 17's in the 1/4 mile.
Granted my car had high miles, but i didn't miss a gear and was running good gas with octane boost.Withiot some after market upgrades you're not going to do too much better.

    Peppy best describes this car. It's a four banger.


     The gas milage is good as well. 26 city and 30-35 highway. And that's running 87.

     It's descent out of the hole and maintaines a sporty feel throughout all gears. I took mine up to 128 mph and even at that speed it had a good scence of the road and gave me the feling that I could trust it.

     I find my car turning heads all the time. Compliments are generous and often.


        The Honda/Acura reputation speaks for itself. My Integra had 190,000+ miles when I blew it up. It would have run more but my maintenance schedule wasn't up to par.

    Rear seating is adequate. Being a father of a four year old daughter, she looks to have enough leg room even with the burdon af a car seat.

    The hatchback offers plenty of hauling room as well. I once hauled a full sized dryer in my Acura. Believe it or not.
