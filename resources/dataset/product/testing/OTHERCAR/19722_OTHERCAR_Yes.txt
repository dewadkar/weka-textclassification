            I got this camera as a birthday present so I didn't have to deal with comparison shopping.  I've used it for a couple of months so now I have some experience with it.  My sister thoughtfully provided a gift receipt so I could have exchanged it.  I did a cursory check afterward (on this site and other digi-cam website) but concluded that this was the best deal.  I was a little unsure of Sony as a camera brand, but since I'm not a pro, my camera needs are modest.

The camera is interesting because it has a (almost random) mix of both advanced and beginner aspects/features.  For example, it offers manual override for almost every parameter (like focus, exposure, white balance, etc.), but then it has really short battery life (the ones included in my box and even several "new" batteries didn't work!)  It supports several file types with (jpeg) or without compression (tiff), but comes with only a 4meg memory stick (lots of low quality vs. a few high quality pics).  Several flash modes (and adjustable flash level - very useful), but it takes a few seconds to recharge the flash between shots (important when taking pictures of uncooperative babies).  You can record videos, but they are small in size (you can record as long as you want given memory space) and have no sound.  

Aside from the compromises, the pictures were pretty good for my purposes.  The images seemed just a tiny bit slightly blurred, but I'm still experimenting with the sharpness adjustment (another cool feature).  And both indoor and outdoor images are good.  When it comes time to transfer pics to your computer, the USB connection makes it really <b>fast</b> and easy.

I ended up buying the accessory package which included rechargeable batteries (which allows the camera to tell you estimated battery life remaining in terms of time) and AC adapter and a carrying bag.  I strongly recommend the starter kit for the battery and AC adapter alone.  I also purchased a 64meg memory stick. I didn't think I really needed to since you can always xfer pics to your computer, but I was going on a trip for a week (see my review on the Allegro resort in Aruba) and I didn't want to worry about running out of space (I didn't and the pics and movies were great).  

It's probably not the "best" camera in its price range any more (1/2002), but I'm really happy with mine.  If I had to buy it for myself, I would.

PS - I've dropped it a couple of times (~3 feet) and it still works great.
