                 My trade-in for this vehicle was a 2001 RX-300. On the test drive I felt as if I had written a letter to Lexus, describing the weak areas of the 300 and they proceeded to address ninety percent of them.
     Foremost among the improvements is the ride. While the 300 had soft ride, much like luxury American brands, the 330 has a firm controlled feel almost European. Much of this can be attributed to the up-sized 18 inch wheels, two inches larger than the previous edition. The steering is well weighted if not quick and the body roll when cornering is well subdued. The 300 virtually whallowed around corners. The handling is so good I didn't feel it necessary to get the four wheel drive option. In the 300 that gave an added sense of security, but at the cost of mileage and acceleration. The increase in horsepower coupled with a new 5 speed transmission make the 330 feel lighter and peppier if not actually agile.
     Inside the car the interior has been similarly refined. The first evidence of this are the firmer more supportive seats which offer a wider adjustment range. The driving position is further enhanced by the new tilt/telescoping wheel. All the controls are within reach and easy to understand with the exception of the mirror adjustments, but this can be forgiven as this model has memory function for the mirrors; Something lacking in earlier models.
     Added features for 04 include "Rain Sense" automatic wipers, power rear gate, in dash CD changer, 3 way split rear seats, extra accessory power outlets, front and rear, and more storage areas. Dual zone automatic climate control is another welcome addition.
     The only gripe I have with new interior treatment is the "bushed aluminun" plastic in the center console. I have rather seen more wood or color keyed trim in keeping with the otherwise rich warm materials used elsewhere in the cabin. On the exterior the silver tail light treatment is a bit much, especially with darker colors.
     With all the new features it was surprising to see they held the price. I actually paid less for the 330 than I did for the 01 300, although there are some pricey option packages that can run the price into the upper forties, expect to pay in the upper thirties for a nicely equipped vehicle.
