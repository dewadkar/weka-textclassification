            The Grand Am that I own is a 1991.  Plus, it was a hand me down.  I paid $1.00 for it, and I'm glad I didn't pay a penny more.  It is not worth it. It's the little things that are falling apart, and if you get several little things together, you get a BIG expense.  

One day, I was buying a gas cap because mine had broken in two somehow.  Well, the gas door can only be opened from inside the car.  Well, I was having problems with it, and all of a sudden, I heard a &quot;pop&quot;.  Turns out, the spring broke, and I now have to stick something under the lever inside the car, walk around to the other side of the car to see if I triggered it so I can open the door and pump my gas.  It is a big nuisance.  But too expensive to get fixed on a college students income.

Another thing that has broken on the car have was the window, which came off the track, and I got fixed, just to have it break three months later. The passenger side lock broke, so I couldn't use my key to open the door. The console in the middle of the two front seats is broken also.  Not to mention my heater doesn't blow warm air, it spits out stinky, cool air.  

I guess if I had it to do all over again, I would have not asked for a hand me down, and picked the car myself, because the pain this Grand Am has put me through is not worth the cheap price I paid for it.<br><br>
