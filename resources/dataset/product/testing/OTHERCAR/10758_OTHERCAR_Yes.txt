            I bought a very used 92 LS because I wanted a big car and had $3300 in my pocket.  That's the price the lot quoted me, and so I drove it home.  Within 1 hour the Check Engine light was one, and except for approximately 2 days since, the light has become my constant companion.  I don't even notice the flashing airbag light anymore.  They think ($200+ later) that it's the right front sensor.  So I make sure not to wreck on the right front.

It is cushy and it does hold its speed down the road.  I stay well behind anyone I remotely suspect will hit the brake.  I'm a slow driver generally, but I have found myself going 75-80 and not noticing at all.

Alas, nearly everything small has broken over time.  So get used to either being in the shop or watching it die a slow death.  I had transmissions and brakes serviced immediately, so those didn't die.  But the 4.6L is notorious for burning oil (mine still does).  Every window except the passenger one broke.  I recharged my own air conditioner, and in the summer need to do so every 3-4 weeks.  It takes a long time for warm air to blow.  

Several of the electronic conveniences broke: trunk release, gas cover release, touchpad for locks, etc. Also this model is subject to the charming mildew in the AC, which will run you $95 at the Ford/Merc shop.  Sun crack in dashboard.  Completely replaced almost everything in the steering column.  Mass AirFlow sensor ($200+) is now unplugged.

The paint on all the trim, especially the bumper chips off.  This is a common complaint I've seen.  Mine had a bad "new" paint job when I got it, same color basically, so I imagine things weren't looking so good.  The drivers seat tilts --- hundreds of dollars to repair.

I was hoping to get 200,000, and at 163 I might.  However, I'm shopping for something else and suppose I've gotten the $3300 + $3000 service I've put into it over 40K miles.  I say it's worth $1000 now, so I suppose that's reasonable.  The most expensive day was $1100 for a variety of things.  At least there weren't any of the $2000-3000 biggies I've seen online.  Guess I should feel lucky.

I should end on a positive note.  The front and back seats are both huge.  I prefer a manually reclining seat with electric controls for everything else, and that's what this car has.  Also, lights of every type are everywhere.  Very classy.  Two people could sleep comfortably in the car --- especially the back seat.  I nap on even 3-hour trips sometimes, and this is the car to do that in most definitely.
