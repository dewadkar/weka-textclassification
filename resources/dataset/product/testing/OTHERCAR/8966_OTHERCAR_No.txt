            Let me just say that all the negative things about the Topaz expressed on this message board are ALL TRUE! If you want a really good excuse to miss work twice a week get a Topaz...of course you'll be spending those two days a week in the shop! If you have 10 hours I'll tell you everything that's broken or fell off this car in the last 3 years, but why bore you? I'll just tell you my two favorites. I had never heard of a &quot;Harmonic Balancer&quot; but when mine FELL OFF I sure learned how important it was! I also learned how to write out a check for 800 dollars. Then there was the gas tank that rotted clear through that wasn't even detected until I brought the car in because the Muffler fell off. The mechanic told me if I had driven around any longer, the exaust fumes from the absent muffler could have started a fire igniting the gas leakage and I wouldn't be here today to tell you about it! I got the 1993 Topaz from my mom in '97. In three years I think we've sunk about 6,000 dollars in the damn thing. I was once in the shop 4 times in one month because things just kept rotting, breaking, loosening and falling off...without any warning! It died on the Tobin Bridge in Boston as a Red Sox game was letting out, thus causing the hugest traffic jam in Boston history. The passenger side door mysteriously STOPPED OPENING one day. The puzzled mechanic said somehow the lock mechanism had cracked in several places causing the door to appear 'welded' shut. The door would have to be pried off with the jaws of life at the tune of 400 clams. Then there's the fact that the remaining three door will NEVER lock again. All my friends have to climb over the front seat in order to sit in the passenger seat, if there's ever a fire (Which is more than likely) The shot gun rider is TRAPPED. I literally cannot think of anything reliable about this car. I don't mean to sound rude, but DO NOT LISTEN TO ANYONE who has ANYTHING good to say about a Topaz!!! Oh wait I forgot about gas mileage, wait, what gas mileage? In this car, it's called gas FOOTAGE because it costs about $23 dollars to fill the thing, so if you even want to put $10 in, you'll be stopping for gas again by sundown! Hmmmmm, I guess I can think of a FEW good points, let's see, well it has a cool name, &quot;Topaz,&quot; The tape deck worked, the AC worked. Oh yea, my friends were no lie, so afraid of being in it that I ALWAYS got out of driving when we'd go to clubs. If your STUPID enough to ever own a Mercury Topaz, you might want to also invest in Triple A, and A cell phone...and make sure triple A is programed into the speed dial 'cause you'll need it. I'm not kidding, when I call them, they say &quot;Oh, hi Greg, What happened to the Topaz today?&quot;<br><br>
