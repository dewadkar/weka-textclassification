            G'day
I've had fun in my Mirage DE Coupe since September 2000.  It makes me feel young when I drive it, at least for short distances.  The styling is attractive and racy, the 1.5 litre engine is quick and efficient, especially round town.  The model I own has no air-conditioning and is a manual transmission.

Pros:
- I get 41 miles per US gallon (about 6 litres per 100 Km) though I do mostly highway driving
- Instrument panel and controls are positioned fairly well.
- Reliability - only one breakdown in 30 months (26,500 miles/42,400Kms) 
- reasonably quiet engine
- lots of head and leg room.
- Safety - I hit a dear at 65MPH/100KPH and while that caused USD3,500 damage to front of car I remained in full control, air bags didn't activate and seat belt did its job.  I was in middle lane of freeway at the time.

Cons:
- It's too hot!  It has no A/C and the coupe styling keeps the hot air inside the car from escaping.  Needs better cabin ventilation.
- Cabin ventilation - also causes side windows to fog up in Winter.
- braking - front wheels lock up quickly when road is wet.
- Comfort - driver's seat is giving me lower back pain and leg support is minimal.
- Cost of repairs - only part I've had to replace (other than tires, wiper blades, etc) was the distributor.  This cost over USD900 to replace and part was most of that cost.
- Cabin noise - too much road noise in cabin on highway.
- Insurance cost - higher than other cars.
- body work - seems to attract parking lot dings like bees to honey, much more than my other vehicles.
- Paint - uneven fade and too much fade for a fairly new car.
- Depreciation - faster than other cars in its class.

Recommendation:
If it had better seats and A/C I would keep/buy this car again.  For a person on a limited budget and wants a fun car this is it.
