            First I must say that I'm far from a professional photographer, I'm just your average amatuer and this is my second digital camera.  My first opinion about this camera is WOW!

You've seen the other reviews that list what this camera can do (pasted from another website).  I'm going to just tell you what I like & dislike about it.

I did a lot of research on what I wanted in my price range.  I bought for $475   ship from bridgeviewphoto.com.  I also bought a 128MB CompactFlash Card to fit a lot of high quality pictures (well worth the investment.)

I would suggest going to a store to play with it a little before purchasing online.  The weight is significantly heavier compared to an Elph camera.

Likes - 
1) For one, a great picture.  The clarity is outstanding.  When zooming after taking the picture, there are things I can see on people that I don't think I ever wanted to see.
2) Zoom is great.  3x Optical zoom & 11x Digital zoom.  Very cool.
3) Movie clips!  The S45 has a 32MB CompactFlash card to fit more files.
4) I like that it seems to be "dummy-proof" for an amatuer like me who doesn't know much about shutter speeds and such.  There are setting to change for fast moving objects, cityscape pictures, etc.
5) The viewing screen has great quality.  I like the option of viewing 9 pictures at a time and even zooming in very close after the picture is taken.

Dislikes -
1) Movie files don't have the quality of the pictures.  No zoom capability on movies.
2) Price may not be what you're looking for.
3) The battery seems to run out quickly (about 4 hours with viewscreen on).  I suggest buying a backup battery.  However, it would seem to last through an entire session of at least 100 pictures.
4) I didn't like the software provided.  It seems as though there's a different software package to do a different operation.  I uninstalled it all and just kept the drivers in.
5) The stitching feature is neat, but it seems to take a lot to learn.  I didn't see the point in it after being able to do a video file.


All-in-all I think that this is a great camera.  I can't see it going out of date anytime soon.  On a scale of 1-10 of my satisfaction, I'd give it a 9.
