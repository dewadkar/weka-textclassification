I purchased the Stratus 41/2 years ago and have nothing but trouble with it since.

The first thing to go wrong was the brake cylinder leaked and was recalled

The Air conditioning went out and it was the air compresser which eventually turned into a recall

The steering wheel moves up and down while I am driving a very little bit but it still does it and it is irritating.

The shifter moves from park to reverse to drive without the key being in the ignition.  Again this was a recall.

The brakes went out at 30,000 miles and again it was a defective part.

The tie rod is now brken on my car but it is not covered on my extended warranty and this car only has 40,000 miles on it

so after reading all of this I like the comfort that the car offers with the cab forward design and the trunk is ver large.  If this car didn't have all the problems I'm sure I would still buy another but with all the problems that I have had with this car I do not think I will ever buy another Stratus again<br><br>
