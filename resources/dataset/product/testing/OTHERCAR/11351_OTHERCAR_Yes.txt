            Our family purchased a 1999 Dodge Caravan after carefully researching the family car (sedan), sport utility, and mini-van classes of vehicles.  We purchased the standard Caravan with air, cruise, power windows and a CD player.  We bought an optional cover for the front of the van to protect it from rocks etc.  Initially the purchase was made for several reasons: 1)The Caravan has more room and is more versatile with the use of space than a comparable sedan or sport utility, 2) The Caravan, in our opinion, was more attractive than other mini-vans, and 3) The purchase price was less than a sport utility and comparable or less than a family sedan.

We have owned the Caravan for about six months.  The vehicle is comfortable both in the amount of space for passengers (we have three kids) and in the area of climate control.  The temperature is controlled easily and it is warm and comfortable in cold weather as well as cool in warm weather.  We have the standard heating and air conditioning (we do not have a rear heater or the rear air ducts available on the higher models). 

The handling is responsive. The driver side rear door is a plus. The warranty covers practically everything and the fuel economy is good (over 20 mpg).

My wife loves the Caravan and I find it practical and a good value.  I would recommend the Caravan for families that have a lot of driving to do.<br><br>
