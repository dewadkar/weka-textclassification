            My husband and i purchased a dodge sport minivan last year and consider it the worst mistake we ever made.  We have been through one transmission, one s belt, 4 power motors on our windows, two recalls on latches and one recall on the seat belts.  Of course there help at there shops is non existent and on several occasions we have had to just take the van to our mechanic and have it fixed there.  

With three kids i can tell you that NONE of them will buy a dodge anything,,,since standing beside the highway looses its appeal after the third or fourth time.<br><br>
