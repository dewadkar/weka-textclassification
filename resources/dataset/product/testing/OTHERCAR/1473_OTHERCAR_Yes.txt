            I bought my 2000 Cadillac Escalade because my husband made me!  I fought him every step of the way.  I feel if I'm doing the driving, i should be doing the picking too.

I picked the last vehicle, my 1997 Dodge Grand Caravan, which I loved.  Except for all the mechanical problems, the air conditioning failure, complete lack of service from Dodge, etc... I loved it.

So, now my husband strong arms me into buying a monster truck that I'm scared to death to drive.  I'm still thanking him.  I LOVE IT.  We travel frequently and have a home in the mountains.  We needed the 4 wheel drive to get back to the trails we like to hike and for snow and hazardous road conditions.

The leather interior is incredibly luxurious and easy to clean (yes we have kids).  I actually was put off by the Cadillac name, because it seemed rather pretentious for me, and it's typically associated with senior citizens, and i'm only 39!

I love that my children have headphones and radio controls in the back.  They can listen to their Brittney Spears cd while I listen to my radio station.  It's roomy in the back so they have plenty of their &quot;own&quot; space.

It rides fairly smoothly and turns on a dime.  It handles really well, although sometimes I have to hunt for a decent size parking space.  I love the rear barn-style doors, being a short person they're easier for me to open and close than the type that lifts up.

Also, anytime I've had to go into the dealership for anything, they treat me like a queen.  All of my questions have been answered to my satisfaction and they don't treat me like an idiot.  I also love the On Star Service which is available for about $200 per year.  I have a definite sense of comfort that if I have a problem, they are there to take care of it.

I highly recommend the Escalade if it's the size and type of vehicle you need.<br><br>
