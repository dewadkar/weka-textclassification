            I had been having a blast buying from Ebay on the internet, when I discovered that if I did not want to waste film and time through scanning pictures, I would need a  digital camera. 

I had been buying antique art for my archival work of antique holy cards, when like most collectors, it was time to become the seller.  It often happens that collectors start buying too much &quot;stuff.&quot; The time then occurs when selling what you don't want anymore, will not only fund the &quot;habit&quot; of buying, but also clears the necessary storage space to keep it. 

Initially, we looked for an inexpensive camera.  Soon we discovered that I would be totally frustrated if I had to wait to download software when using a digital camera.  I did not want more than a few steps from taking the picture to placing it on the internet. We found that this model Sony digital camera was more expensive than other brands on the market, however, the ease of use and quality of images were well worth the additional cost (floppy in, floppy out, up and onto the net...it is that easy)

Finally, it has not just continued to be a tool for me on Ebay, but a toy for my two daughters.  They have taken Halloween photos of each other and sent them to their friends. I would recommend this camera for the neophyte and the expert.  It works as easily for the beginner as for the expert. Blessings...Julie<br><br>
