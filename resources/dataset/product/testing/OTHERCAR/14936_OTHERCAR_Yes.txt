            In November of 1999, I decided to give myself an early, albeit expensive, Christmas present. Having used a friends Sony Mavica for several months to take pictures for my online auctions, I knew exactly what I wanted. At one point my friend sold his Mavica FD73 for an FD88, so I got to try both out extensively before purchasing my own. Knowing that my need for this camera was basic, the FD88 with it's ability to make short mpegs was not on my agenda and I opted for the FD73.

<b>Pros</b>
Like a plug and play computer, the FD73 is easy to use, even if you don't read the entire manual. With minimal reading you can take great pictures 'on the fly' and learn as you go. I've not used all of the options available yet (and I may never have need for a picture in sepia). But there are many different settings this camera has to offer <i>if</i> desired.

Some of the color functions available are:
<i>Sepia</i> - for sepia colored images
<i>Negative Art</i> - The color and brightness of the image is reversed
<i>Black and White</i> -  No color
<i>Solarize</i> - The picture looks like an illustration as the light intensity is more clear 

Some of modes available:
<i>Soft Portrait</i> - creates a soft background for subject
<i>Sports Lesson</i> - for fast moving subjects, such as a game in action
<i>Beach &amp; Ski</i> - for strong sunlight
<i>Sunset &amp; Moon</i> - for darker environments
<i>Landscape</i> - to capture the objects behind your subject with clarity

There is a great deal more that this camera has to offer but I am not familiar with them all. Personally, I love the simple things about it, such as the ability to view the pictures and decide whether to keep or delete them. The portability of taking a picture and handing it over to someone (before or after you make a copy for yourself). The fact that it uses regular 3.5&quot; floppies for image capturing and storage. 

The format is extremely easy: no need for software or cables to hook up. Just click, eject, and slip the floppy into your computer. It couldn't be simpler. I have a regular camera that is just gathering dust, mainly because I hate bringing in the photos to be developed. No need with this camera. Best of all, even if photography is not in your blood, it takes really nice pictures! It's portable, simple to use, and a great deal of fun.

<b>Cons</b>
Unless you really enjoy reading manuals, it does take some time to learn all the camera has to offer. Also, the cost makes it prohibitive for the 'casual' user. The batteries that came with mine are good for apprx. 120 mins on full charge which is a bit short, but since you can turn it off, this con is only problematic if you are taking it somewhere where you cannot recharge for an extended time.
