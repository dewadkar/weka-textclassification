            I bought the Sentra new after reading positive reports on the Nissan products.  Through out the 3 year warranty the car had the sync/gears replaced twice, steering column replaced, air flow failed, the struts replaced three times, brakes problems, muffler/exhaust replaced, windshield wiper mechanism replaced, premature rust  in the trunk, and the window rubber seals replaced four times (due to shrinkage...2 door.  The gears lock out of first and reverse, and it's a battle to get the car in gear.  When the window seals shrink, it takes two hands to roll the window up, and water runs inside the door.  A Nissan service tech told me it was a problem with the 2 door Sentra's,(the shrinkage) and now that the warranty is expired, it is the owner's responsibility to replace, even when the seals are sure to shrink again.  The seat belts lock, and don't allow free play.  The customer service 1-800  does not encourage resolution as it promotes itself to.  The mediation available is limited to certain criteria, therefore not allowing any recourse when a customer  wants to appeal certain service / repair issues.  This particular model was built in Mexico, if that has any significance<br><br>
