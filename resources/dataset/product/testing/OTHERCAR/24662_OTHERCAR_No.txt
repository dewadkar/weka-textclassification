            : I call my car the Saturn ON, because the &#145I&#146 keeps falling off of the &#145ION&#146 trunk ornament. It has actually fallen off twice. So far. I&#146ve only owned the car for 9 months. I haven&#146t had any &#145major&#146 problems with the car (knock on wood), but I&#146m not so sure I&#146ll make it through the warranty without something major happening. I have little confidence in this car. I buy new cars because I don&#146t enjoy taking cars to get repaired. Regular maintenance is one thing, but car problems are another. The 2nd month I owned the car, the front blinker went out. I thought that was odd for a brand new car&#133 I also had trouble with the Oil Light coming on. I still don&#146t know why it came on, they said it only had to be re-set. Whatever that means&#133 then as winter set in here in Lake Effect Snow central, my hood pull broke. I couldn&#146t open my front hood. It&#146s really hard to replace much-needed windshield wiper fluid when you&#146re unable to open the hood of the car! I had issues trying to get squeezed in for service at the local dealer. It took several weeks to find a time that was convenient for me. Which also meant I drove around not being able to see for quite some time. I tried opening the hood by using a pair of needle-nose pliers to grab onto what was left of the wire that was once attached to the hood pull. No luck. Just left me more irritated. I&#146m not real thrilled with the &#145lightness&#146 of the vehicle. And the car overall feels like it&#146s going to fall apart at any moment. Every time I get out of the car, my foot catches on a plastic panel that supposed to be attached to the center control panel and I end up ripping it off and then having to fight with the thing to reattach it. 

Oh, and what&#146s up with the recall? I&#146m taking the car in the shop again tomorrow to get this fuel line thing fixed. Not so sure I want to gamble with the possibility of my car catching on fire?!

Positives?? I will say I drove from New York to Kentucky in one day over the summer and had no problems. And the gas mileage was great&#133 I also will say I like the center control panel. It looks cool. However, the rest of the interior is very bland. The fun control panel seems almost out of place! 


Performance: It&#146s ok for what it is. I will say it does very well in the snow&#133 and I&#146ve had plenty of experience with driving in the snow this winter! 
 

Interior: Love the control panel. The seats could be more comfortable and I don&#146t think there&#146s a lot of leg room in the back. But it&#146s fine for my 7 year old son. The interior is rather plain. 
 

Exterior Looks and Features It&#146s a basic sedan, looks like all the rest! 

Final Thoughts:  I can&#146t wait for my warranty to expire. I&#146ll be in huge trouble! Then again, I&#146m not so sure I&#146ll keep the car that long. Even if I have to pay the loss, it&#146ll be nice not to have to wonder what&#146s going to go wrong next&#133

Recommended: Not so much.
