            This is our 2nd Camry.  We had the 1999 model, which I hated.  The 1999 model was cramped and rode much smaller that the 2003 model.  My wife had to coax me to go along with her decision to upgrade, and wow, she was right this is a much better car.

The 2003 model is a larger and more solid car than what Toyota was producing a few years ago.  The doors and trunk are much heavier that our old vehicle.  Where I always felt cramped for leg room, the 2003 model has no problem with my oversized frame.  There is plenty of headroom too, even with a sun room.  The sight lines are excellent overall, without any blindspots.  The front seats are comfortable in all positions and the dash board instrumentation is visible and fully accessible from the driver's seat.  The rear seats have plenty of room too.  Thanks Toyota, the few extra inches of room make a big difference.

As far as driveability, Camry is good.  This is no speedster on the road and the feel is a bit top heavy.  Acceleration is fine, and the engine smooth at all times.  The transmission and engine are quiet, certainly much more so than the 1999 model.  The car zips along at 80 mph on the highway, although the speed is not obvious to the driver.  Braking is soft and rates only fair by me.  We have yet to use the AC, but the heater, like all Toyotas is first rate.  Traction in the snow is outstanding.

Now, I am glad to be seen in the (her) 2003 Camry.  I am now a believer, where before I was skeptical about the Camry model. This is a very solid and reliable choice for our family.
