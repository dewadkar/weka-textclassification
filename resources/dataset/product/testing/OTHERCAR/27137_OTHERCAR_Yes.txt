            I am lucky enough to own a 1998 Dodge Avenger ES. I have owned it since August of 1998, and have had a few minor problems with it but generally it is a good car. It is roomy enough for 3 carseats in the back seat, yet still looks sporty. The minor problems have included a leaky window seal, mirrors that fade, and a check engine light that would not turn itself off. All were completely covered by warranty, and I must say that Dodge (or Daimler-Chrysler rather) has EXCELLENT repair facilities. I bought this car because I wanted something that was fun, but had enough room for the necessities. The only things I really dislike are the engine, and the amount of road noise. I am fortunate to have the 2.5L V6, but it still does not have the power that a car that is supposed to be competition to the Chevy Camaro and Pontiac Firebird should have. I think with better insulation and more motor this car would be a serious competitor. It is fun to drive, for a very tall, or even a very short person, the tape/CD deck is easy to reach as well as use, and it is a much more comfortable ride than any other sports car/sports coupe I have ridden in so far. The visibility out of the rear window takes a little getting used to, but once you do, Watch Out World!!   This car would be great for anyone who loves to drive, and still likes creature comforts.<br><br>
