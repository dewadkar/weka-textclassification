            ...because I thought Hell would freeze over before Hyundai ever made a car that I found even slightly impressive.  But with the new for 2001 XG300, they have.  The XG first caught my eye when the commercials started running a few months back.  Then after seeing one on the road, I decided to go in for a test drive. At only $24,000, and with a huge list of luxury features, the Hyundai XG300 has given Accord and Camry buyers a reason to think twice. (or so Hyundai hopes).

<b>Exterior Styling</b>
Overall, the XG300 is not a bad looking car.  Hyundai gets no points for originality--as the front and side of the car look as if they have been ripped off a drafting board at Infinity.  Add a dash of the new Lincoln LS and a rear end that is just plain ugly, and you have Hyundai's new flagship.  The standard 15 inch alloys are a bit too small in my eyes--Hyundai should have bumped them up to at least 16-inchers.  Overall, though, the exterior is attractive and more grown-up looking than anything the Korean automaker has churned out before.

<b>Interior</b>
The interior sports the normal near-luxury materials--leather, acres of faux-wood, and natty aluminum accents.  Headroom is snug, especially with the optional moonroof.  Front seat shoulder room is adequate for most, but once you get in you realize that the XG300 is not as big as it looks.  While the plastics seemed top-notch and the leather appeared to be durable, the XG300 smelled like an economy car---a small thing to be sure, but makes me wonder if the seeming quality is all a ruse.  
Backseat passengers will find plenty of room, and are served by a large armrest with flip-out cupholders and a storage tray.  Adjustable headrests fore and aft are a rarity at this price point.  

The dashboard was attractive and sensibly laid out--except for a main cruise control switch which fell behind the steering wheel (just above the drivers left knee).  Numerous storage areas open with a touch (a la Lexus)allowing room for sunglasses, cups, and compact discs.  Missing on my test car was the optional climate control--but one would be hard pressed to come up with more features that Hyundai might have missed.  

<b>Driving the XG300</b>
Perhaps the most impressive feature of the XG300 was its standard tiptronic-type transmission. From DRIVE, just pop the shifter to the right and you are in manual mode.  It made driving the car much more enjoyable and got the most power from the six cylinder 192 pony engine. 

Also remarkable was just how quiet the Hyundai was.  There was virtually no engine or road noise, even at 70 mph.  The car cornered admirably, and acceleration was surprisingly brisk.  In either mode, the transmission shifted smoothly.  

<b>Overall</b>
I probably would NOT consider the XG300 as a purchase.  While Hyundai seems to be making great strides in their quality and reliability departments--and are even backing their cars with the best warranty in America (5 years, 60,000 mile bumper-to-bumper), I will need a few more years before I am convinced.  Resale value has traditionally been abyssmal for the marque.  However, the XG300 may well be what elevates Hyundai's status--despite a ho-hum exterior, the long list of options and powerful drivetrain starting under $24,000 will certainly have consumers giving this new sedan a second glance.<br><br>
