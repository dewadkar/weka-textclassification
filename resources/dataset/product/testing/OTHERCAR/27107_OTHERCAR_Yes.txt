            I bought my Cutlass Supreme SL 4-Door in mid May 2001. I wanted a car that had more creature comforts than my '88 VW Jetta. I also wanted a car with a little more get-up-and-go than my trusty Vee-dub.

The Cutlass Supreme, introduced in front drive form in 1988, was relatively unchanged until 1997 when it was replaced by the Oldsmobile Intrigue.

The Cutlass, as I shall call it from now on, has a rather not threatening exterior design. The body is not too rounded, and the car gives off a touch of class compared to some other cars on the road. The paint is original, and even in the frigid cold of 7 eastern Canadian winters the paint has held up well. Not one speck of rust. Knock on wood.

The inside of the Cutlass recalls GM of yore. Ye olde turn signal stalk has controls for the signals, windshield wipers, windshield washers, high beams, and cruise control. GM seems to think this is a cutting edge design and has been using it since the early 1980's. The front seats are comfortable for trips of any length, and the tilt steering wheel is a welcome feature. Folks riding in the rear will like the amount of legroom, however, I doubt they'll like the cushy rear seat. Your bottom falls asleep pretty quickly back there. The dash is non threatening. All controls are easy to find without taking your eyes off the road (minus the turn signal stalk of course). Power windows and locks are standard, as are air conditioning and a rear defroster. Canadian models get daytime running lamps, a safe touch. Dual airbags and ABS are thrown in the mix as well. The trunk is very spacious. I recently moved from Nova Scotia to Prince Edward Island (about 300 miles) and the Cutlass swallowed up a lot of my gear. Unfortunately, the rear seat doesn't fold down on base models.

The 3.1 liter V-6 puts out 160 horsepower and 180 foot-pounds of torque. When you dip into it, the tranny can move the Cutlass pretty fast, however, it makes a very unfashionable roar on acceleration. The steering system is damped to the dickens. There is hardly any feel for the road at all. Calling the driving experience dull would be a compliment. The tires melt on hard cornering and understeer is always king in the Cutlass. The brakes get upset easily, and you find yourself practically standing on the pedal in emergencies. When the ABS kicks in on wet pavement, you find yourself thinking, "Am I going to stop?". If you finally do stop, you need a few seconds to catch your breath. And check your shorts. The ride is very smooth and quiet however, and long trips are very nice and tranquil. If you're a Sunday driver, your search for a car is over. Gas mileage is so-so around town, but on the highway it's a lot better.

Reliability hasn't been a major problem. The front brakes have been replaced once since I bought the car, and the rear brakes are on their 2nd run. The horn is currently on the fritz, and the driver's seat belt now has stopped clicking in its latch, so I have to use the middle passenger one, luckily right next to it. The light switch went crazy all of a sudden, leaving me with no brake lights. The daytime running lamps are getting a little testy, coming on only when they feel like it. The alternator died soon after I bought the car. Even though these problems are headaches, I would much rather have them than have engine or transmission problems. The powertrain has been flawless so far, and for that my Cutlass makes me smile.

I like my Cutlass. I don't love my Cutlass, but I like it. It's pretty reliable, and it looks cool. The ride is smooth, and it's pretty tranquil to drive. Not fun to drive, but tranquil. I must say though that I have never owned a car that had such a lack of personality. If you need a car for long trips, then a Cutlass would be a great choice. It's cargo space and quiet ride will make you grin. Its lackluster handling will not.
