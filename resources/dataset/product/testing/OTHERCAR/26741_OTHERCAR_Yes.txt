            Before I bought the Olympus D360L, I bought the Kodak DC215 digital camera.  The Kodak was only 1 Megapixels.  Also the Kodak had excellent color saturation because of the Kodak name and technology.  However if you take a lot of continuous pictures like for 30 minutes or more, it would overheat and shut down or lock up.  The Olympus D360L did not have this problem.
 
For a low end 1.3 Megapixels digital camera, the Olympus D360L is a great point and shoot camera.  You can either use the LCD screen to frame your shots or use the viewfinder.  Although with the LCD screen what you see is not exactly what you get.  You will get around an extra 10 percent outside of the LCD in your final picture.  (The Kodak DC215 is 100% accurate as opposed to the Olympus camera).

Colors of the Olympus is not as saturated as the Kodak one but is still pleasing to the eyes.  

Sharpness and details of the Olympus is better than the Kodak one because of the  1.3 vs 1.0 Megapixels.  I have seen some 3.3 Megapixels camera shots that are just are good as the 1.3.  It really depends on what you are taking.

This camera can print a decent 5 X 7 photo.  Larger than that and it is a bit more grainy.

There are also various resolutions.  Sort of like super high res and standard res.  I've found the SHQ to be adequate for monitor usage (15 inches).

A 32 Megabytes smart card using SHQ can hold about 134 shots.

Batteries, (make sure you use the rechargeable nickel metal hydride ones.  Look for ahms.  Higher means more battery time), can last about one hour or so continually if using the LCD for framing.  Longer if you turn on and off as needed.  However if you use only the viewfinder, it really can last a long time as the battery is hardly drained.

The only downsize of this camera is the lack of an optical zoom.  You only get a digital zoom which means it takes the picture and enlarges it internally and therefore the resolution degrades.

Also, I typically have to use +5, one step up from zero, on the EV because my pictures usually seem dark.  By upping the exposure one step, the pictures turn out pretty good.  Unless it is a bright shot, then I don't.

But for an entry level and simple aim and shoot camera, this camera is worth the price.  (Until the higher megapixel cameras drop to this price range)
