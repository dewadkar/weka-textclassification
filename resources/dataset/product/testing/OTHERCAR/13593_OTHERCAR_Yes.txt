             I waited 6 yrs. to buy a little sorry model with a hardtop. Parked outside and under a pine tree it needed lots of TLC but over the past 4 yrs. it has only improved in looks and performance.
 
  Synthetic oil in the engine, gearbox, and dif. have made cold weather driving easier. I believe the temperatures while auto crossing also are more easily dealt with. Yokohama AVI s keep the car on the road and are good on the track. They are very firm during the colder months but in the summer great.

  Trunk room is fine. A weeks groceries for 2 are no trouble. We toured in the Rockies last year for over a week, much better luggage room than my motorcycle and more comfortable but not as fast over mountain roads, but faster than anything else on 4 wheels.

  Found sill guards in stainless steel a good investment as was the inflatable back supports that fit behind the center of the seat back.

  Very reliable, battery life seems to be about 3 yrs. I belong to the local Sea to Sky Miata club and get good discounts on filters and service, not that I have had much, new rear coil spring, clutch slave cylinder, timing belt ( at 96,000 ks ) anti freeze change. The Splitfire plugs and KN airfilter are still going strong 30,000 ks later

  A four wheeled motorcycle, best car I have ever driven for response and handling. If you don't enjoy driving this car you don't enjoy driving!<br><br>
