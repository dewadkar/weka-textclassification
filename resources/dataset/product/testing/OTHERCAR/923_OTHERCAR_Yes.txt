            This is the first digital camera I have owned.  I am into gadgets, but I have stayed away from digital cameras mainly because they have been reltively expensive (compared to 35mm SLR's), with far less flexibility and image quality.  My previous experience with cameras have been with Pentax K1000, Nikon FE, Nikon N6006, as well as with smaller point and shoot cameras like the Canon Elph Jr.  After I purchased the Canon Elph Jr, I realized that I loved the size of the smaller camera.  I would rarely bring an SLR to parties, weddings, etc mainly because they were so bulky and didn't go to well with a tuxedo or suit.  After I bought the Canon Elph Jr, I put it in my pocket and brought it everwhere.

Previously, I thought the Nikon D1 would be a camera I might be interested in, but I could not justify paying more than a Leica SLR for digital technology that I knew would only get better and cheaper.  Although they are now up to 6 megapixels plus, I know that regular 35mm film ASA 64 - 100 has about 25 megapixels. When I saw how small the Minolta Dimage X was, I decided to bite the bullet and buy my first digital camera.  I knew that it didn't have all the bells and whistles, and optics of more expensive cameras, but I did not care.  The size was perfect.  So I brought it along to my Paris vacation.

It behaved as well as I thought it would.

My setup:  Minolta Dimage X with spare battery.  128MB Secure Digital Memory Card.

Pros:
1) Fits neatly into pocket, or in my case a PDA case, which also has a small pocket in which I can put my extra battery and memory card.
2) Very handy size.
3) Did I mention the small, handy size?

Cons:
1) Image quality.  Some of the pixels get saturated with overexposure.  (By this I mean that some pixels just turn white with no useful information)  Examples would be with outdoor sunlight backlighting, and reflection from water surfaces on bright days.
2) Digital zoom images appears a bit pixelated, and probably would not be great for much larger than 4 x 6 pictures.
3) Battery life.  Lasted me about 30-50 shots in 1600x1200 mode with standard resolution with display on.  I also would review each image I took - which I think is how many people who purchase this camera would do.  It is supposed to last longer with the display off, but where is the fun in that?  I stongly recommend a spare battery.
4) I would say that the "ASA-equivalent" of the this camera is like ASA-100.  Bottom line - not very useful indoors without a tripod, unless it is for snapshots or people less than 12 feet away, which is about the limit of the flash.
I used a small tripod inside several cathedrals with OK results.  I tried to take pictures inside large rooms without a flash - with poor results.
5) The viewfinder does not correlate well with the actual image.  Specifically the viewfinder underestimates the field of view.
