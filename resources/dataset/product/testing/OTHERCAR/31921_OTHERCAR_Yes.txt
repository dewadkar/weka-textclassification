            I bought a 2001 Subaru Forester after falling in love with the car when it debuted around 1998.  I loved the fact that it was shaped like a bread box, which meant there would be no more awkward shoving of plastic tubs into a trunk that clearly wouldn't accommodate more than one.  This thing can fit so much cargo, that you could literally move out of a small apartment in only a few trips, especially if you use the roof rack the right way.  The AWD is great for cities that get bad weather and/or snow - I live in the city and was the only one who could navigate the snow-laden alleys if they had not been plowed.  ABS brakes are standard and the gas mileage is excellent for an SUV.  I'm up to about 26 miles per gallon highway and have about 30k on the thing now.

Women will like this SUV because it is built on a car base and allows you easy entry and exit in a skirt (no climbing required).  Moms will like the extra safety belt precaution that comes through the trunk area for car seats.  Guys will like the many options available - bike racks, roof racks, cage separators for the trunk, sun roof, etc. as well as the many storage areas - which are truly unique and ample all over the car.  Anyone will love the fact that the lights automatically shut off when the engine is off.

Subaru has a standard 36k/3 year warranty and I have never had cause to need it so far.
