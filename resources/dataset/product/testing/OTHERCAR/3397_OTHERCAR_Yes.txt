            I have owned a 97 Quest GXE since 5/98. I have had multiple warranty problems such as Oil Pan Gasket replacement, Pulley Assembly, and Various Electrical problems. The most recent problem not yet addressed, is the vans need to lock itself after the door gets slammed just a little too hard. I left my Quest running in order to go around to the back and open the tailgate. As soon as the door shut I knew it had locked. In 115 degree heat, I waited 3 hours for AAA to get there to open it up.  Thank God my 6 month old baby was not in the car at the time. We now make a practice of cracking the windows enough for an arm before getting out for gas, or mail, or anything else. Service has been pretty good by the local dealers, but I get a feeling that the 97 was not a &quot;good&quot; year for Nisson and the Quest Line.<br><br>
