            Purchased car for work and personal use. I work as a technician and needed a car that could carry all the spare parts required for repairing copiers. I drive an average of 1000 miles/month for work purposes so the car also had to be very dependable at the right price with good mileage.

The Chev Prizm has met all the criteria - I have had it for 10 months and put on over 20,000 miles with zero problems. A great car!

It's not flashy or exciting - just good dependable transportation.

I got the LSI model which is the loaded model with cruise, power windows, auto trans, etc. Worth the extra money.

Negatives would be a fairly small back seat and the cup holder is inthe way of the ashtray when it is open. The radio station buttons are small and a little difficult to use while driving. The B post is in the way while trying to look over my left shoulder to see if a car is in the lane next to me.

Overall I highly recommend the car.
