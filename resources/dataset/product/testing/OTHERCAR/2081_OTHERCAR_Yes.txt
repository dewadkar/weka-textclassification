            I'll be honest - I did not buy this truck to be a work vehicle; I bought it because I wanted an American V8 "sports car."  The Camaro/Firebird or Mustang were more expensive and almost impossible to insure!  With the Dakota Sport V8 (5 speed) I got a great, fast engine, cheap insurance, lots of room inside, a passable back seat, and a huge trunk! ;)  I had my Dakota for 3 years with virtually no problems.  My only gripe was with the clutch.  The throwout bearing went bad on me twice (once under warranty, once not) and the clutch went out shortly after I sold it (oops, sorry) and for a while, it didn't really feel right.  Other than that, I have no complaints.  It is a solid, well-built truck that handles well in all kinds of weather.  It really showed me what it was made of when I drove from Chicago to Flint, MI in a wicked blizzard.  At the time I had the original Goodyears and no modifications.  I honestly drove straight through without having to stop once, even though the median and shoulders were just littered with all varieties of cars and trucks, front-wheel drives included.  It never ever got stuck in the snow, and handled nicely in the rain too.  This was without any ballast in the bed.  

Of course, no matter what your intentions for buying a pickup, it will get used for work duty eventually.  It's funny how your friends get much friendlier with you when they have to move.  And my Dakota did the job(s) without breaking a sweat.  The standard suspension held up very well no matter what we threw back there (appliances, furniture, half a dozen people, even a rebuilt musclecar big-block!) and the engine never seemed overworked.  Even towing the occasional trailer, the engine just purred along on the expressway, loaded or not.  

The interior was quite comfortable in front, with plenty of room for the bigger folks.  The backseat was a different story.  If you need to bring a couple kids, or one not-so-big adult, the backseat is sufficient.  I do not recommend going too far with more than one adult in back.  There is almost no leg room, and the seat back is straight up and down, which can be quite uncomfortable after a while.  But for shorter trips, it's ok.  I've ridden back there myself, and I could sit diagonally over to one side and put my legs up on the seat.  Not bad that way.  Also, it was a bit of a trick getting in and out of the backseat as the seats didn't slide up enough in my opinion, and the seatbelt always got in the way.  Of course, I didn't buy it to haul people around.  I mainly wanted the backseat for interior storage space.  I mean, you have to have someplace to throw your gymbag/briefcase/groceries/whatever when you don't want the stuff in the bed.  The controls were all clearly readable and easily adjusted.  The dash wasn't too fancy, but after all it's a real truck.  The upholstery was tough but comfy, and never showed any signs of wear in three years.  The only part of the interior that I did not care for was the super-long stick shift.  That tended to result in some long shift times, and didn't really help when I was trying to surprise the occasional Mustang ;).  

And speaking of the occasional Mustang... wow, was this truck fast!  It had the Magnum 318 with a 5 speed and 3.55 Sure-Grip gears.  I had no problem whatsoever when extra "passing power" was needed.  Even right off the line, it was no slouch.  Of course a heavy right foot will help bring down the average mileage, but I still managed to keep the mileage in the upper teens - quite respectable for a 4200 pound pickup with a V8 and a Speed Racer behind the wheel!  Incidentally, the mileage didn't change at all when I installed the fiberglass bed cover.  

Unfortunately, living in the city is not particularly conducive to owning a big extended cab vehicle like this one, so after 3 very satisfactory years, I had to sell.  I do really miss that truck sometimes, as it was fun, dependable, comfortable, and a real work horse.  And it held it's resale value extremely well.
