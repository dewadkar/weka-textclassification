            When I worked at KB Toys we got these on a shipment near the Christmas rush.  They started at a price of $99.99, which wasn't bad for a digital camera.  After Christmas the price began to drop, all the way down to $29.99!

At this price I had to buy one to use for my ebay auctions.  I needed a digital camera really bad for my items but couldn't afford the $200 I had seen most cameras at.  When I saw $29.99 I was skeptical about the versatility of this camera but took the chance.

This isn't a camera for adults.  It may be ok for children (thus the Jr. name, right?) but it was a disappointment for me.  There were at least four major cons to this with only a couple of pros.

First I noticed how easy the software was to install and use.  There are some tricks to it that take time to learn but for the most part the software isn't hard to utilize.  You can be dowloading pictures from your camera in a few minutes.  The hardware consists of one cord that plugs in as easily as the headphones into a Sony Walkman.

After that, it was all downhill.  The color on these pictures was really bad.  When I photograph large items such as jerseys or posters the colors are completely off (black turns to blue, red to pink, etc.) and it's not much better on small stuff. Some of the colors improve if the object photographed is in &quot;perfect&quot; light, but some don't.

Storage is something you can forget about on this camera.  It holds six photos at a time, and there is no way to insert a disc or similar media to increase the storage.  In other words, be near the PC when you use this one.

Blurring is a big problem as well.  No matter how still I seem to be standing I can't get a picture that doesn't look like it was taken from an automobile window.  The same for grainyness, it's in every shot.

For an example of how this camera's shots look at it's best check out the picture of me on my profile page.  I'd tell you how to find my auctions to see more but I think epinions rules state that I can't post that address.  Trust me, they aren't that great.

If you want a cheap option to see if you really need a cam or if your children are ready this isn't too bad a choice.  There are some useful items in the software and the camera itself seems able to take a beating (I drop it often).  If you want professional quality pictures of your family, vacation, or other important memory skip this one.  It's worth the cash to go top of the line.<br><br>
