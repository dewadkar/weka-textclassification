 How often have we been in the mall or a public or charity event and there sits that bright shiny new car with a great big &quot;WIN ME&quot; on the windshield? There stands someone telling you for just a few bucks you too may become one of the few, the proud.... the lucky!!!!!! So there you are thinking OH GEEZ... not again........ as you circle the car, you have to admit that it does look pretty good. Nice color. Small but yet roomy. It would look kinda nice sitting in my driveway..... but no, I will never win. After all, just look at all those entries in that thing! What are the odds that little ole me could actually win this car..... no, I will not bother, I never win anything... I will just be wasting my hard earned money.... But it IS a nice car and well, it is only a couple bucks to enter.......no, I think it is just a gimmick to make money.. I bet no one actually wins... I bet they just keep all that money! But what if they don't? What if someone really will win it? I could win it! I have just the same chance as everyone else here! Look there is my neighbor Ethel... she is going to enter? She is SO tight with a dollar she sqeaks when she walks! SHE does not really think she will win does she? That does it I am entering, I WILL WIN&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

Fast forward a few weeks. There I am at home. Exhausted from a very long week at work. Doing the laundry, the house is a wreck and I need more sleep. My husband reminds me that morning that the drawing for that car we bought raffle tickets for is today. I am thinking yea, there goes four dollars down the drain. On his way out the door he tells me,&quot;I am sure they will be calling you to pick up the car anytime&quot;. Yea, Right I say as I look at the dishes in the sink. Several hours later while sorting the colors from the whites the phone rings. There is a lady on the phone. What did she just say? She is calling from some charity and I have won a car? Oh yea, right lady...... CLICK.... I hang up on her! I am going to kill my husband, bet he has had someone at work do this! He thinks this is funny! Well, I will show him funny when he gets home! There the phone goes ringing again.......HELLO? Yes, what can I help you with? She tells me again she is calling to tell me I have won a car..... yea, lady and I am the Queen of England........and I do not have time for this because I am trying to run a country here....CLICK...... I hang up again! Now I am really MAD! He is taking this just too far and I am mad as hell! OH GEEZ, not again. The phone this time the lady says,&quot;please don't hang up! Do you not want the car you just won? I am trying to give you a brand new car&quot;!

Well, after talking to this woman a few more minutes I find out that I really did win a car! A GEO PRIZM!!!!!! The raffle that I entered in the mall! The one I spent four dollars on! I had really won a car for Four dollars! When I got to the dealership, there it sat! It was the most beautiful car that I had ever seen! 

After bringing this car home I found that this was one of the best compact sedan's that I had ever owned! The car that I won came with Automatic transmission, air conditioning a stereo with a removable face.
The Prizm has great acceleration ability. From a stop she would really get up and go! I found that it was very quiet, no excessive road noise. The Prizm had great steering capability also. She cornered like she was on rails for a sub compact car! The paint job held up well to all kinds of weather conditions and weathered well. The upholstery was very sturdy and did not tear or show dirt or grime. We never had to have any major maintenance on the car and she never broke down. We changed the oil every few thousand miles and had other routine maintenance but that was it. The front was very roomy and comfortable but the back seat was a bit cramped for a large person. Since my car was a four door, there were few problems with people getting in or out of the back seat. Another great feature of owning this car was that the insurance was also low as were the property taxes!

The GEO prizm was a wonderful car that lasted many years. It got great gas mileage and was very comfortable. It had everything I needed in a car and the best part??????

IT WAS FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

IT WAS FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>
