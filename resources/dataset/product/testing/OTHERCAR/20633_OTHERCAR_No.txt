<B>Comfort and Amenities:</b><HR>Like in most German cars, the seats of the A6 are very firm. They are too firm for some people. The standard seats in the 2.7T are too flat for aggressive driving. I highly recommend the Sport Package to get better seats. The rear seat is large enough for two adults to ride in comfort.<br>
<B>Performance and Handling:</b><HR>Teh engine in the 2.7T is very powerful. Because the turbos are small, they spin up quickly and lag is close to nonexistent. The engine could make more sophisticated sounds that it does.

The suspension is too soft for a car with this level of performance. It rolls a lot in hard turns. The tires are also far too narrow, slipping fairly easily. Both of these problems can be mitigated by getting the Sport Package.<br>
<B>Safety:</b><HR>This car has four airbags standard and two more for the rear seat are optional. It has antilock brakes and all-wheel-drive, so it should go, turn, and stop well in inclement weather. Overall, this should be a very safe car.<br><B>General Comments:</b><HR>Read my review of the 2.7T auto first.  This review covers only the differences with the manual version of the car.<br>

Note (10-20-2000): I have taken a second, very extensive test drive in another sample of this car. Sometime in the next few weeks I will write an all-new review. The clutch was not really an issue this time, though the shifter was still strange. Very aggressive driving unearthed new issues: the suspension is way too soft and the tires too narrow. The seats could also use more bolstering. A Sport Package, not on any of the cars in my area, would at least partly fix the suspension, tire, and seat problems. I will give the car four stars in the new review to reflect this. Soon after I write the new reivew, this review will be deleted.

Note: I have added an update to the end of this review to reflect a very informative letter I received.

I expected to really like this car.  After all, the S4, with the same powertrain, was a blast to drive.  Not so with the manual A6 2.7T.

What went wrong?  In a word, the clutch.  The clutch of this thing has an extremely long travel.  I thought my own car's clutch (a Ford Contour) had a long travel.  The Audi feels like it has at least twice as much, I'd guess a good eight inches.  It felt like a yard.  And the clutch only bites at the top of its travel, and then it bites immediately.  This makes smooth shifts very difficult, and shifts in general not very fun.  

The shifter was no joy either.  It wasn't bad, just not the best I've tried either.  It was a fairly floppy affair where the travel felt a bit long and the length of the arm too short relative to the travel.  Still, compared to the clutch not much of a problem.  

Overall, the manual transmission seems ill-suited for the character of this car.  As I noted in the 2.7T auto review, the driving position isolates you a bit from what's going on.  Usually a manual remedies this situation, and makes you feel wired in.  Not so here.  You spend so much effort trying to fly through 16&quot; of clutch travel fast and then slow down enough to feather a very quick take-up that you can't enjoy anything else.  If you want an A6, you want the 2.7T auto.

Update: Someone who owns this car wrote me and said that the clutch in his car differs greatly from the one I drove.  While the travel is long, take-up begins about the half-way point, and is gradual.  Giving me the benefit of the doubt, he contacted other owners.  Apparently, clutch calibration differs considerably from car to car.  It seems the car I drove lay at one extreme.

With a good clutch, I would heartily recommend this car, though the driving position is still not ideal for driver involvement.  The person who wrote me is planning to install a kit to shorten the travel of the shifter--this would likely enhance the driving experience, as would wider tires and a slightly lower suspension (as found on the A6 4.2).

The key lesson is to pay a great deal of attention to the characteristics of the clutch in the A6, and perhaps in other Audis as well, before taking delivery.  Request that the clutch be adjusted if it is not to your liking, and if the adjustments don't help (modern hydraulic clutches often aren't very adjustable) then request another car.<br><br>
