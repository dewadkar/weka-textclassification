            I've had my Grand Cherokee for 5 months now and haven't had a problem yet, though I will admit it is a little harsh on the bank account.  I bought mine in Texas where the lot has few with 4WD because its not exactly snowing down here!  The only 4WD models on the lot had every feature which put it above my price range.  My regret is that I didn't special order one with 4WD... the worst feature of this vehicle is the rear-wheel drive which I find to have much worse handling (especially in the rain) than all my previous front-wheel drive vehicles.  If you get this vehicle though, you must go for the leather seats.  I test drove both and they are completely different seat designs.  The leather seats really take this vehicle to the next level -- true comfort.  The Infinity Gold Sound System is also a particularly good option which has helped me enjoy even more my eclectic musical tastes while on the road.  This is a sleek-looking, well driving SUV though... and I love it!  I have wanted one of these for years, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.  It is a comfortable ride.  But don't be fooled, it is an SUV and will not drive as smooth as a car...
