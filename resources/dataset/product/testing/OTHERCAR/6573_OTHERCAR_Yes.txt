            The Car is POWERFUL.  I have beaten a NEW Maxima with a manual and custom exhaust.  The only mod I am aware of is that the distributor was advanced so that the car requires high grade fuel for more power.  That doesn't really matter because I still spend a LOT less on gas than with my old Explorer, it does get good gas mileage.

The back seat is better than what you would find in any other convertible of that year.  You can't beat a Chrysler convertible on legroom.  The seat is relatively large, though the legroom is less than in a sedan.

On an 8 year old convertible you have to expect problems, only a fool would expect perfection.  The top on mine was worn out, it had a tear and the trim around the edges was fallen off.  Even still, the top didn't leak, but because of shrunken door seals, the water still drips in, soon to be fixed.  The top motor needs to be rebuilt because it overheats and shuts down while raising or lowering the top.  That was an easy fix, I just disconnected the hydraulic rams from the top and converted my top to manual - this is not an uncommon practice.  I found a new top online for $150 and had it installed for $250 at a downtown upholstry shop.  Now that the top has been replaced, I am surprised to find that the car is relatively quiet - for a convertible.  It does not get very noisy until I get up above 65Mph.  Still, however, I find it difficult to use the cellular speakerphone at highway speeds.

The engine is pretty reliable, but the belt tensioner began to buckle and had to be replaced.  The V6 has a few oil leaks and burns a small amount of oil (Friends of OPEC).  Otherwise the engine is great.  The engine is very EASY to work on, especially for the shade tree mechanic.  There is lots of room under the hood and most everything is within easy reach.  I was able to change all of the spark plugs and the PCV valve in under twenty minutes with no bruised knuckles.  The oil leak has led to a motor mount weakening.  It has not given out yet but when I gun it in reverse, the engine rocks and the exhaust pipes creak.

The automatic tranny needs to be checked every so often because the fluid level gets low and it starts to shift funny.  Like most other Chrysler products, it requires a special type of Transmission fluid, called Type 7176 Auto Trans fluid, which I have never found in any store.  The guy at the Auto Parts Store said that 7176 ATF type fluid is the same as Chrysler Type ATF+3 Transmisson fluid, which is still about twice as expensive as plain old DextronIII type Auto Fluid.   Low fluid levels are the #1 reason for transmission failure in Chryslers because nobody ever thinks to check it.

Mine does not have Anti-lock brakes, which it needs.  When the roads get slick, the brakes lock up and the car slides wherever the roads may slope.  Many people don't like ABS but I swear by them.  If I can ever get the money up, I'm going to have to have ABS added or it will be the death of me.

At one point I had a problem with the floor flooding after rain and couldn't figure out why since the top doesn't leak.  As it turns out, water is supposed to run down the top, through the body, and out underneath the car through the frame.  If the car bottoms out then the drains bend and plug up.  A drill and an awl fixed that problem easy.

The air conditioner and heater work fast and great, both will more than make up for the relative lack of insulation in the roof.  I have found that even on cooler days, if you put the windows up and the heater on MAX, you can still be warm with the top down.

I bought mine used, already with mechanical problems.  While I have not had the time or money to fix all of the problems, they are trivial.  I have noticed that since I have bought the car, however, that no new problems have turned up.  These cars are old and need to be taken care of, not flogged and thrown around like you can get away with in a new car.  If you don't know how to take care of a car yourself - you had better just buy a new Honda.

My Lebaron is a GTC model which supposedly means the suspension is sportier than on LX models.  I personally feel that the ride is a little too harsh and the handling not sharp enough.  I have heard of people putting Eibach progressive rate springs to get better handling, but I have never driven one so equipped.  I believe that some softer shocks and stiffer sway bars would do much better.

Even with the problems it makes for a great car on a budget.  On '93-'95 models, most people can't tell they aren't new.  '94 and '95 models are the best bet because they are equipped with the new CFC-free A\C, which is cheaper to recharge and better for the environment.  '93 models, however were the last ones equipped with V6s in combination with manual transmissions, though these are hard to find.

Update:  I keep having trouble with the engine running a little too warm for my liking.  I have kept plenty of coolant in it but the needle still climbs at stoplights.  This may be attributed to a worn out radiator fan, I've heard these often need to be replaced in these cars.  I tried to buy a new fan motor but the parts store told me the only place I could get a new one was from a dealership - the same as with a new Tranny mount.  Apparently the convertibles use many parts that are unique to the convertible and not shared with other Lebarons.

Update:  Finally got around to checking the gas mileage - 26mpg.  I mostly drive on highways at about 60-65mph.

GAAAH!  I recently had trouble with the Passenger door.  It became difficult to close and eventually it started rubbing against the front fender, until finally it wouldn't open at all.  I took it to the body shop and they told me that the hinge had come completely unwelded from the door.  They had never seen this before and sent me to the Chrysler dealership.  The dealership said this is common on 2-door Lebarons and told me I had two options:  get the hinge rewelded and have it break again or Buy a new door.  I got it rewelded and it opens and closes fine now, but they say its only a matter of time before I buy a new door.

Update:  Soon after I got the door fixed, I noticed that the plastic trim on the door had come loose, so one day I fixed it with some double sided tape.  A friend later got into the car and I heard an awful noise.  I got out and looked and saw that when he had opened the door, that the trim (which had come ever so slightly loose again) had grabbed onto the front fender and pushed it WAAAAAY in.  I took out the wheel well lining and pushed the fender back out (and then some) but now there is a crease in the fender.  All of this stems from the hinge problems I had earlier.
