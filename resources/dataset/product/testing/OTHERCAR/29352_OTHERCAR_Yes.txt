            In it's price range, the Honda CR-V will give you the most space for the money.  Beyond it's roomy interior, the vehicle is looks nice and drives well.  It gives you all the creature comforts at an affordable price such as cruise control and tilt wheel.  For a 4 cylinder engine, this car is responsive and peppy.  You'll think that you're driving a larger engine car.

I love this vehicle because it is fun to drive.  The engine responds quickly and the automatic transmission shift smoothly.  According to Car and Driver, it accelerates in about 8 seconds to 60 mph.  The roomy interior shows no sign of compromise for a small SUV.

A minor problem with this car is the gas mileage.  I average 21 miles per gallon which I hear could be better, but then again, in it's class, it's probably the biggest car so it's expected that it will use more gasoline.

Honda has designed this car well making it a &quot;sporty&quot; family car that's fun to drive and a good alternative to a mini van.

I would highly recommend this vehicle for families and anyone who wants an SUV but cannot afford one of the larger ones.<br><br>
