            I really didn't want to fool with all the special disk formats and installations onto my computer so that I could use the other cameras on the market even if they do hold more space. This camera uses the classic floppy disk so it's really easy to take a picture and have it out to friends and family in about 30 seconds, less if your fast with the mouse ;) It takes 1.3 megapixel pictures with fantastic quality. It's a step in being rid of the old style of film forever, atleast in recreational and family use. The 5 second of MPG option doesn't sound like enough time but it's a lot of fun. Don't think of it as ONLY 5 seconds of movie, but instead as a very advanced picture. It's also incredibly easy to use. I figured out every feature and function within about 5 minutes without even glancing at the manual. All in all, if you want a good well-rounded digital camera, this is the one. Takes great pictures, easy to use, lots of options, features, and alternative types of picture sizes, qualities, and formats. It's probably the only camera I'll need until they release the first Digital 3d camera :)<br><br>
