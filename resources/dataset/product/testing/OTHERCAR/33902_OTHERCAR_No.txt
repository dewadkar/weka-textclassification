            I bought my 94 2WD Nissan Hardbody new as an economical way to transport my racing motorcycle to the track. In only 11,000 miles the engine had been rebuilt once and replaced once. The dealer said that they were having problems getting all of the casting sand out of the oil passages in the block at the factory. Lots of my friends owned these at the time and highly recommended them. The speedometer gear broke the first day I
had it,also the AC failed twice, a modification kit had to be installed to keep the gearshift boot on, and the oil pressure sensor switch also failed. The dealer service was just fine but I didn't need to be setting up residence there. I replaced it with a Toyota Tacoma which is also reviewed in here and is just great. This is my second lemon Nissan. The first being a new 81 210. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me I guess. I will never buy another Nissan product again. There was rust on the front bumper the day I picked it up and it always vibrated at highway speeds no matter what I had done to it. The dealer's answer to this was,&quot;They all do that,your's is one of the better ones.&quot;<br><br>
