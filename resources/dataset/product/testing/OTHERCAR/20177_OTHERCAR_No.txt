            The Suzuki Swift was the first car I bought out of college in 1996. I liked it's compact size and the hatchback, which gave me plenty of space to cart around my meager possessions. I had nothing but problems with it for the four years I had it before it died. A few months after buying it, I couldn't get the gear stick (on an automatic) into any position but park. A year and a half later, the air conditioner died for good. After four years, immediately after I finished paying for it, the transmission died and it was beyond repair. Twice, once during the air conditioner fiasco and once right before it died, parts of the engine literally fell out of the car while I was driving it. This is a good car for little old ladies who need to get to church and back and don't want to spend a fortune on their wheels, but if you are buying it for the long haul, or if you expect to be driving a lot, don't buy it.<br><br>
