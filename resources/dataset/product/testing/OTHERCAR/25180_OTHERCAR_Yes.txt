            We recently purchased (November 1999) a Mazda Protege.  We previously owned one and had great experience with it.  Being that we were in need of another commuter car, we decided to compare it to a few vehicle - Volkswagen Jetta, Honda Civic and a few models from the Hyundai line.  As you can see, we did not want to spend a lot of money on such a car but we did still want a little bit of &quot;luxury&quot; in it.

We ended up choosing the Mazda Protege because of the exceptional financial incentives they were offering - a 3 year 0% financing and a $750 rebate.

We purchased the top of the line model - Protege LX - the one with the bigger engine.  Now I'm no expert on engines and such but having test driven all different models available with the Protege line, I found that there was a difference in how the vehicle manuevers with a different and much bigger engine.  The acceleration is much greater and this one has the low profile tires making it take curves much better.  The interior package included with CD player and such made this a very attractive car to have....economy with luxury at the same time.  The only negative aspect of the car that we, both my husband and I have found is that getting in and out of the car, one hits their right knee on the dash.  Now we are not giants by any means (I'm 5'2&quot; and he's 5'8&quot;) and yes, we keep the seat at the appropriate distance for driving, yet when it is time to get in or out of the car, one has to make sure to push the seat back to ensure NOT hitting ones knee.  And the one other pet peeve of mine is that the power door lock button is only accessible to the driver and not the front passenger.  Other than that I highly recommend this vehicle!<br><br>
