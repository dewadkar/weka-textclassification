            In a majestic world where every soccer mother must own an SUV for some company instilled, inane reason, this actual SUV breaks the shell. 

With gasoline prices soaring, all of these rich people with their SUVs that they got just because their other rich neighbor got one are rather stuck. The point: These automobiles; the Cherokee, Explorer, Durango, Rav4; they are all respectable cars, but have ridiculously inflated prices due to their right to call themselves 4WD vehicles. 

Land Rover is a British company, in fact, it is a royal company, meaning they have links to the crown, and exclusively provide their product to the government. In a time when Britain controlled such territories as the Australian Outback and much of Mid- and South Africa, the government used these true Sport Utilities to navigate this rough terrain.

These SUVs are actually what most claim to be. They are actually capable of handling almost any terrain. But why would  you want one???

In almost all of America, this ability is not remotely necessary. If you need to travel through 2 feet of mud or snow, or navigate South African diamond mines, by all means it is worth the 60,000 bucks. 

Final opinion: This is the first time I'll highly recommend a product but say not to get it. You simply don't need it. (Most of you.) It's worth it, but there is no reason to get it.
