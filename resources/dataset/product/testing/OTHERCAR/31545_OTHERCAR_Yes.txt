            Before buying this camera, I had a Kodak DC210 Plus that I returned.  Although the Kodak did take good pictures, I had to replace the AA batteries after every shoot and transfer (It doesn't come with an AC adapter).  This Fuji camera is GREAT!  Not only are the pictures amazing, but the rechargeable battery lasts a pretty long time even if you do use the LCD most of the time. Its easy to use and the small size is great for carrying it around in a coat or shirt pocket.  I only wish it had a USB connection because the serial does take a long time.  I definatley recommend buying an external USB memory reader.  It is worth the exta $40 bucks and the transfer time is speedy (Not to mention you just pop the memory card out of the camera and into the reader) I purchased it for $440 dollars online and I think it is better then my friends Olympus that he paid $800 for. A must have camera.  You wont regret it. <br><br>
