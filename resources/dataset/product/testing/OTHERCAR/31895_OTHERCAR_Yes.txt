            i am a mechanic and recently found a 92 4-door for 500 with a blown head gasket, a common problem with quad 4's with over 80k on them..
the car has 166k on it.. after getting the car on the road, 150 more for gaskets/head bolts/ resurface, i found common problems with a car with such high mileage..
 i replaced the struts/ hub assemblies/ ball joints/ brakes/ tires and now have around 1500 into the care with my labor included..
the car has a nice interior and a good look to it..the only problem i have with the car is that it has a lot of road noises from old pavements.. same as the grand ams.. which is basically the same car built by pontiac..
other than that with the current price of gasoline at 1.60/gal, 30 mpg makes the car even more appealing..i recommend this car, just keep in mind that because of abuse of previous owners it may need a head gasket in the future..
no one ever changes the antifreeze which becomes toxic to the motor and causes these problems..also change the trany fluid on any used car you buy to prevent trany problems from occurring, another neglect from a previous owner no doubt..<br><br>
