            The Pontiac Grand Am, what a great car. This car is sweet. It's sporty enough to zip you around town yet roomy enough for a family of five. I have two children that fit quite comfortably in the back seat. One is even in a car seat. I am very happy with the convenience my car has to offer me. It is reliable and has never been in the shop. I have taken many trips from NY to Fl in my car. I have a 1995 that I have owned for 4 years. I couldn't be more happier with any other car. The Pontiac Grand Am is well trusted and is number one in my book.<br><br>
