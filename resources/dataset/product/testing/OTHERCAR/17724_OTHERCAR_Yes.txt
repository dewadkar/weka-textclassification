            When it was obvious that my '87 Corsica wasn't going to make it much past 130,000 miles, I started looking for a new car.  I didn't have a lot of money, I didn't have a lot of time, and I'm way to picky for my own good.  I ended up with a 2000 SL2, and I couldn't be happier.

To make a long story short, my Corsica's registration was set to expire and the repairs to make the state inspection would have cost more than the wholesale Kelly Blue Book.  I needed a new car, and I needed it fast.  I wanted a reasonable four door sedan, manufactured in the US, that wouldn't bust my budget but also wouldn't look like that boring car that everybody drives.  

After test driving nearly every vehicle in the small and midsized sedan markets in 48 hours, I settled on a used 2000 SL2.  And here's why:

1.  Manufactured in the US.  95% of a Saturn's innards, including all of the drive train, are manufactured in the US, and that's important to me.

2.  Excellent gas mileage.  Even though I kind of like the smell of gas, I don't like the sound of my credit card sliding into the pay-at-the-pump thingy, so gas mileage is key.

3.  Classy styling - How do you make a car that millions of people own still look unique?  Whatever they did, it worked.  I didn't want to drive a Corolla or a Civic.  Saturns just look a little different, and I like that.

4.  Interior comfort - Its no Bentley, but the SL2 offers a reasonably comfortable interior.  Spartan, but comfortable.  I drove from Pittsburgh to Tucson in 3 days and I don't have any complaints.

In the year that I've owned it, I've learned a couple of things about my Saturn, and I'll share them as well.

1.  The factory speakers are actually decent.  I installed a $400 head unit and I was sure I was going to need to drop a bunch of money for new speakers, but I was pleasantly surprised to hear the Saturn speakers with a decent head unit.

2.  A Saturn is not a race car.  Even when you want it to be.  Really, really bad.  The SL2 has decent pickup for a fuel efficient 4 cylinder made by GM, but remember, this is not a speedy vehicle.  And since its a GM DOHC 4 cylinder, you will get some vibration.  Surprisingly, I get the worst vibration at around 55, but it dissipates as I get faster.  None of it is bad enough to make me regret the purchase.

3.  On surface streets, there is very little interior noise.  At 75, there's a little too much.  But still not enough to make me unhappy with it.

All in all, I ended up with exactly what I wanted.  The SL2 isn't flashy.  Its not fast.  But its a little different.  Its very reliable.  And it works every day.
