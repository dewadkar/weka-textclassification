            Hey folks,
Are you interested in purchasing a car? Or are you intending to trade-in your vehicle? As a current owner of 3-gen Altima V6. I can tell you that I'm still in love with it since the day I bought it until now. People choose to purchase a vehicle from some certain points. Here I'm going to list these specs for you to show you why do I recommend.

Performance
 Third generation Altima was introduced as a 2002 model with a totally new exterior and interior, with increases in all major dimensions, along with a totally new platform. And it also introduced the first time equipped with 2 engines available, either L4 or V6. You��ll get 175-horsepower 2.5-liter DOHC 16-valve 4-cylinder producing 180 lb-ft of torque in a L4 engine. It is very competitive in its class; however, I personally recommend this first-in-this-generation VQ35DE as your daily beater. With 240 HP (2002, 245HP in 2003), 246lb-ft in torque you��ll have to worry about nothing about your performance. What else can smoke you at the same price? WRX? Maybe�Kbut you��ll still pay less than him. Both engines feature modular cylinder head design, lightweight pistons, continuously variable valve timing, and variable induction system. Overall, Nissan��s engines are well known in car industry. Go take a ride, then you will believe. The best 1/4 mile time that I saw is mid-13 (by member on www.altimas.net) However, it won't be economy in mileage since it's a powerful V6. Manual transmision (city/hwy)L/km MPG11.2/8.2 (25/34) If you have a question about the noise of this monster engine. I'll tell you that it will be quiter than your radio. Compare to his big brother G35, people complain it's annoyed on G35. Didn't see anyone talk about it on Altima yet.

Transmission
 Two types of transmissions available; 4-Auto or 5-Manual. You��ll find exactly the same gated shifter on 2003 Maxima and 350Z (not sure if it��s on 2004 Maxima though). I��ve tested an auto Altima V6 before I bought my car. It was pretty smooth, but you would feel a bit acceleration lag when you floor the gas pedal. If you want a fun ride, 5-speed is your only choice. Honestly, Nissan��s transmission isn��t that good since I am kinda disappointed in the stick. Long shifter and cranking sound when you shift at first and second. Maybe it��s because I��m just a newbie to drive a stick.

Suspension, Steering and Braking
 4-wheel independent suspension with extensive use of aluminum components, featuring a rear multi-link suspension design. 16-inch wheels with 205/65R16 tires on 4-cylinder models, 17-inch wheels with 215/55R17 tires on V6. 4-wheel disc brakes with available 4-wheel ABS, Brake Assist and Electronic Brake force Distribution
Pretty good brake on this generation Altima. Very smooth, unlike the one that you found on Taurus or Accord (too sharp)

Interior features & Comfort
Contemporary, relaxed interior design with "cockpit" 3-gauge instrument panel, driver-oriented controls. Distinctive "atmospheres" - complete interior appearance with different colors and textures for the seating areas and dashboard. Optional Bose Premium audio system with eight speakers, in-dash 6-disc CD autochanger
Most new-gen Altima owners complain about its crappy interior. You can see tons of threads on www.altimas.net complaining about this. I have to agree that since my only complaint is the plastic interior. Other than that, roomy is the best benefit that this toy gives us. Nissan used this all-new designed FF-L platform as the one in 2004 Maxima (not 2003 model though) to offer us the roomiest to against competitors. Seats are fairly surpportive. For those who wanna have OEM leather seats, you can always go with aftermarket leather if you ain't satisfied.

Safety
Dual-stage supplemental air bags with seat belt sensors, available front seat side-impact supplemental air bags and roof-mounted side-impact curtain air bags for front and rear occupants. ABS (optional), TCS(available on auto), EBD, LATCH System (Lower Anchors and Tether for CHildren), Anti-theft system...etc.

Models and Manufacturing
 Offered in four well-equipped models: 2.5, 2.5 S, 2.5 SL and 3.5 SE. Assembled by Nissan North America Manufacturing Smyrna & Decherd Tennessee Plants.

Overall built quality & conclusion
After have it for 7 months. I have only one problem with it which is a cracking sound on the base of my seatbelt. Nissan fixed it under warranty (of course). Other than that, regularlly oil change and maintainance is neccessorily needed. There may be some small problems like the cracking sound or weird noise on rear suspension on few people's car. Despite these, there're no such major problems at all. I highly recommended. You wont be able to find a car like this in its class. Third generation Altima��s competitions are Toyota Camary, Honda Accord, VW Passat, Mazda 6. From performance, handling, suspension, safety. I would still purchase an Alty if I have the chance to go back to the market. Have a good one.
