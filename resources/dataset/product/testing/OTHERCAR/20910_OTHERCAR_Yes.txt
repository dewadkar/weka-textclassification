            With all of the SUVs out there, this one defiantly stands out! Chrysler did an excellent job combining the old with the new body styles. When you look at the front of the vehicle, it looks like no other. The clean lines make the vehicle look so modern. Look at the back of the vehicle and you jump back almost 50 years to the old Hurts. This vehicle combines the best of both worlds.

 There isn�t a bad aspect of this vehicle that I can find. Finally, the perfect SUV. It doesn�t cost an arm and a leg either with a base price of only $17,510. You�re probably thinking that this vehicle comes with hardly any options standard. Well, you�re wrong. This grand SUV comes standard with AM/FM stereo, cassette player, a CD Changer, a 6 speaker audio system, a foldable rear seat to offer more cargo space, and a multi-level shelf for added storage capacity. 

That�s not all, there are still plenty of options available on this vehicle. For example, the Limited Edition offers leather, side airbags, a overhead compass with a temperature gauge and compass, keyless entry, heated outer mirrors, and get this, a theft prevention system.
 
Also available in the PT Cruiser, a Touring Group with chrome aluminum wheels, bright exhaust tip, touring suspension, and fog lamps.

 This SUV also gets really good gas mileage with 20 miles per gallon in the city and 27 miles per gallon on the highway. They also ride like a dream. One of my friends owns one of these lovely vehicles and took me out in it the other day and the ride was so smooth. 

There is no better SUV out there folks! This is it! Finally, the perfect Sport Utility Vehicle.
