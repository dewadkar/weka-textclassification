            After a life of driving &quot;rust buckets&quot;, I finally convinced my husband that he needed a new vehicle image.  He test drove several makes and models, and almost settled for a Toyota Camry.  A trip to the Honda dealership changed all that.  He fell hard for the styling and roominess of the Honda Accord EX sedan.  A moon roof and CD player sealed the deal.

I was stunned by the roomy interior.  It's mid-size style gave me the impression that it would be comfortable, but I had no idea the leg room it would have.  Even the back seat passengers can stretch their legs in comfort.  The seats are plush, well shaped and wide.

There is plenty of cargo space, and there's a ski hatch in the back seat.  If you don't ski, it's still useful for lumber, pipes or anything else long and skinny you may want to transport.  The glove box is roomy and there's storage in the front arm rest for LOTS of change and about 20 CD's.

The ride is smooth and quiet, and whenever I get to drive, I'm thankful for the cruise control.  Otherwise, I'm hitting 80 mph and don't even realize I'm going that fast.

It's a very attractive car.  It's stylish without looking &quot;mid-life crisis&quot;; it's sensible without looking dowdy.

The lease runs out at the end of the year, and my husband is already talking about the next Accord.  There's no reason not to.  We've had nothing but a maintenance free, smooth, comfortable, stylish ride.
