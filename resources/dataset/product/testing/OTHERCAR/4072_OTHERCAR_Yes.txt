            We bought this van when my middle daughter was 6 months old. At the time we had one car and we were quickly outgrowing it. We did our research and this van stood out. 

There were 4 things that caught our eye:

-It has a remote door, something I really needed with two small children and all the things I need to carry for them (and now a baby and two preschoolers)

-It has room for seven people. We knew we wanted more kids and didn't want to have a buy a larger car.

-There are several safety features. There are side impact airbags. It also has lights that run all day.

-Carseats fit well in the seats.

There have been some problems with it:

-The remote door has broke several times (covered by warranty).

-The horn is hard to work (as a matter of fact if I drive another car I always inadvertently honk the horn since I'm able to use the Venture's horn to lean on).

-The headlights filled with water and we had to have them replaced (covered by warranty).

I have been very happy with my van. I do regret getting captain's chairs at the moment. It's hard to access the back bench because I have to have a carseat there, but other than that - I love my van!<br><br>
