            The Neon's cute ads and my impeding driving age is what led us to Fair Oaks Dodge in March of 1994 to find out about the Neon.  The salesman did a great job selling us on the car and shortly after we bought it, we were greeted with a smile and a &quot;hi!&quot; from our new 1995 Dodge Neon.

Compared to the car my fiance owns (the famous 1995 Intrepid), I actually like the Neon.  It's not as roomy or comfortable as the Intrepid, but it is compact enough that it reminds me a lot of the Omni.  It comes with a tape deck (our first in a car), air conditioning and power locks, but that's where all the extras end.  We still have manual windows, but Dad insisted on getting the Neon Sport.  We call this his &quot;middle age crisis car.&quot;

Unfortunately, as with most Dodge cars at least in 1995, the Neon has its share of problems.  Shortly after we bought it, the whole electrical system died on us.  Then the air bag light wouldn't shut off and then of course the head gasket blew when we were Bar Harbor, Maine on vacation.

Despite these problems, it's still a good car.  It has a lot of kick and since it's still one of Dodge's few remaining compact cars, it's not too difficult to park either.  One thing I do dislike is the fact that the windshield is slanted so much, I wish they hadn't started to do that with all the cars nowadays.

So, if you ever see a Neon on the road, don't forget their little ad slogan--&quot;hi!&quot;  Anytime we saw a Neon on the road, we'd always honk the horn and wave, as if sharing some special secret with a fellow Neon driver.<br><br>
