            Just bought my 320i(Canadian version of 323)two months ago and have driven about 5000miles in lots of different conditions.First the best parts; Its got that beautiful BMW look,feel,style. 6 Airbags upfront,not bad CD, 5spd shifter is super smooth,brakes are great, ATC-traction control works amazing in snow(even better with real snow tires). Interior is quiet,seats are supportive .Leatherette is not bad for fake leather,easy to clean and warms up nicely. Trunk is big enough. This car feels solid,put together well and rewards aggressive driving with confidant steering,turning and braking responses...this means even the average driver can feel safe and secure and in control in all weather,road types and conditions.The base model is a great value w/o adding a lot of $$ with the packages available. The 2.2L, 168 hp engine is fine(may be Canadian only). The 2.5 180hp is better,but more money.

Second; the cons...cheap looking basic hubcaps,no cruise on base model(not bad if city driving,not horrible unless you really used cruise on other cars). No steering controls for AC,cruise etc. Back seat space tight if front seat likes to stretch out.

Over-all i picked up my car for about 7 grand Can$ less than a new one,with only 22K..km on it. It was cheaper than a new accord and twice the car. Less hp,but heavier,safer and way more style. Shop around for demo's and off-lease, get the Certified Series for the warranty and enjoy a great car cheap and have great resale when you trade up.
