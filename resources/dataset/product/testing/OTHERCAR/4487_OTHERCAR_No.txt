            This will not be a long review as there is not much to say. After 3 years and 30,000 miles, this vehicle has a service record nearly 20 pages long.  Everything that could go wrong has gone wrong.  I am very happy to be rid of this joke of a car.  Additionally the MB service centers give average to horrible service.  Had to return for the same problem 3 times in a row once.  Also had incidents where it went into service for one problem and came back with all new problems.  The dealer tried to tell me that these were first year model &quot;break-in&quot; problems and that subsequent years production lots would be better.  What's the odds of me buying another one of these lemons given this experience --- a big fat zero.<br><br>
