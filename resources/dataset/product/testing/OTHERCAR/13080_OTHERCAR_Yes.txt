            This was my first digital camera that I purchased.  I looked and looked for a digital camera that had good picture resolution and the most important feature I was looking for was an adjustable shutter speed.  The Sony had both of these so I settled on it.  I am not disappointed with this decision.
What is good about it?  Well, the Sony memory stick was a real plus for me.  I have a Sony computer that accepts the memory sticks.  The transfer of pictures to my computer couldn't be easier.  The bundled software that comes with the camera was not necessary for me to use because all (at least mine) Sony computers come with software that makes the transfer and editing of pictures from Sony cameras very easy.  Another great point about this camera is that the chassis is aluminum or magnesium.  I proved that you can drop this camera onto a marble floor and it will still work with no problem (not planning to try that again).  I guess that proves its durability.  The shutter speed is easily adjustable in the manual mode up to 1/1000th of a second which makes taking pictures of fast moving objects a breeze.  It also has a three shot burst that is easy to set up in the manual operation mode so you can have several shots to choose from.  A 128-MB memory stick is good for about 50 pictures at the highest resolution.  Night shot capability is something that I have never been impressed with on any camera, but it has it.  So if you fancy taking pictures in total darkness you can do it. Over all I have been impressed with the clarity and quality of the pictures that this camera takes.  Setting up the camera for the first time was a painless operation.  The instruction booklet is clear and concise.  The MPEG movie option is a nice little feature of the camera.  Keep in mind that it will fill up a 128MB memory stick very fast.
So what is wrong with it?  Well, the Zoom isn't so great.  4x is&#133well&#133okay.  I was dissatisfied with the limited zoom so I purchased the Sony telephoto lens which is expensive ($190 direct from Sony) but it really does improve the long range and close up ability of the camera.  The standard battery that it comes with is also middle of the road.  It will last for about 50 minutes and then die with no warning.  I purchased a high capacity battery (again not cheap at $150) which was well worth it.  The high cap battery lasts for about two hours of continuous use.  Another item I really don't like is the 1-inch screen on the camera.  It is pretty much useless to me with the exception of setting up and programming the camera functions.  You can't see anything on it when the sun is bright, and there is so much crap on it (settings, functions in use, camera status etc.) that it deceives the user of what you are actually taking a picture of.  Sony has a ton of accessories that go with this camera but keep in mind that they are all expensive.
	 I have been very happy with my decision to purchase this camera.  The pictures are great, loading them on my Sony computer is very easy and accessories are plentiful.  The camera is also DURABLE!  It can take a drop and not explode into a zillion pieces!
