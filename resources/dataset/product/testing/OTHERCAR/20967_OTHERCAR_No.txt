            The PT Cruiser is a stylish, new car that's a nice ride, has a nice sound system, and it comes with a CD and Tape Player standard, as well as AC, Heat, and etc.  It's only fault is it's bad blind spots.  But other than that, it's pretty neat.  Not only does it ride well, but it also looks classy.  It's made by Chrysler, and what ever came from Chrysler that was bad?  And you can't forget that the Chrysler PT Cruiser was named 2001 Car of the Year.  So if it was named that, how could it possibly be bad?!  Go ahead, get to your local car dealer and ask for a test drive.  I can almost promise you'll like it.
