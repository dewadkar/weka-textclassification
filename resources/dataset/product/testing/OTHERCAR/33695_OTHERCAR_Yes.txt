            I received this car as a hand-me-down from my parents. They were die-hard BMW drivers until 10 years ago when they test drove a first year Lexus LS400. They fell in love with it and since then have owned four other LS400's.

The car is very reliable. It is now over 10 years old and is going on 130,000 miles. The engine is still relatively quiet and runs very smooth. This car has even been in five accidents and come out of them with minor damage and no serious problems. The seats are comfortable to the point I could fall asleep in them while driving.

There are a few drawbacks to it, being that it was the first year of production. My air conditioner has failed twice, the car batteries drain quickly, and a minor electrical failure. The electronics passed the pivoting point of the steering wheel have just recently failed (eg: horn, cruise control, and speakerphone.) I have also had to replace two struts, but that is because of the special electronic air suspension I have.

The car is quick even for a large luxury car and handles well. Also, it averages about 18(city)-20(hwy)mpg.<br><br>
