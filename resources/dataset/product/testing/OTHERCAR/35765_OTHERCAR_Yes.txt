            Honda is done it once again by making a great car at a very reasonable price. They have slightly upgraded the engine to 2.4 liters/160 hp. It gives great gas mileage and has excellent pick up for a 4 cylinder. Before I test drove it, I was expecting a ride of a typical 4 cylinder, where I would have to really press the accelerator to get anywhere. I was pleasantly surprised when I went for a test drive. I had also test driven the Toyota Camry, Mitsubishi Galant and even the Mazda Millenia with a V6 176 hp engine. Out of all of them, the Honda Accord was the most satisfying ride with the i-VTEC engine, although it was not the quietest. 

On the safety side, the Honda Accord is one of the safer cars out there. I was impressed at the fact that they made ABS on the LX model standard. I just wish they had upgraded the rear brakes to disc rather than drum. Side airbags are optional, which they might make standard in the later models. 

Interior wise, Honda kept the inside simple, as it should be. The LX model comes standard with a 6 speaker stereo system. The sound is great compared to the basic stereo systems in the competing makes and models. There is an in dash CD player with optional cassette deck, which I was standard. Even on the EX model, the cassette deck was optional. I wish the radio controls were standard on the LX model as well. Interior room is good, kind of tight with 5 people, but the competing models pretty much offer the same amount of room. 

Overall, this car is great, and I know it will last me a great amount of time. My last Accord went on for 207K miles before I sold it. I paid about 18,500 plus tax, tag, etc. I would definatly recommend this car.
