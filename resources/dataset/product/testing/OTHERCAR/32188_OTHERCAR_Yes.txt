            THe Standard Cavalier are Ok but to get some bang for your buck, upgrade to a z-24 Cavalier.  For around 17,000 I got a fully loaded race car. Power everything and a sunroof. The z-24 package comes with a great suspension and wheels and tires to boot.  Its fun to drive catchs eyes and will eat up most average honda four bangers. Drawbacks include small cockpit. IM 6,4 and desire more headspace than average drivers. Also its kind of noisie, as a windy sound is apperant from the doors. Other than that im very satisfied with my 99 Z-24.  I recomend Ordering any new car verses picking from the lot. Dealers will usually give you 100 dollars over Dealer invoice..... It turns out to be like 1000 bucks off.... Happy car shopping...<br><br>
