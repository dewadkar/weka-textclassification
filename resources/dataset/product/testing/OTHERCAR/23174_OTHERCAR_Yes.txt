            In November of 1995 I bought a 1996 Honda Accord 4 door sedan.  After test driving several comparable models; the Nissan Altima, Toyota Camry and a Mazda, we decided on the Honda.  In the test drives the Honda has the best pick-up, smoothest ride and was very comfortable.  

Four years later, I still love this car.  It handles wonderfully and is fun to drive.  In the four years we have owned it it has required no major repairs and has had no problems.  The exterior has held up extremely well, with no fading or peeling paint.  The interior has also lasted really well, considering the wear and tear handed out by my family!  

This car has been an economically sound decision as well.  We made an excellent deal on it, and it has retained it's value well.  In the past a new car purchase consistently left us owing more than we could get for the car on trade in value, but the Honda has had positive equity.  We recently paid it off and are very proud to own this exceptional car.  My 12 year old daughter is now requesting that we continue to take good care of it as she expects to be driving it in several years.  I am positive it will hold up well and still look great when it is her turn to drive it!!! <br><br>
