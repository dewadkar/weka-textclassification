            So far, {one week} I'm impressed. The only options I got on the car was leather & roof as the cars standard equipment list is quite long. Fit, finish & the solid "feel" is same or superior of products costing much more. From behind the wheel, the front end slope & "catamaran" fenders reminds me slightly of the 911 Porsche.  Rear reminds me of an Audi on steroids. IMO, it comes together real sweet.  Fact is, she turns head.
The driving experience is far superior to vehicles in same price range.  Have not put my foot into it yet as still breaking her in, but I can tell the power is there. She is very quick under moderate acceleration. Transmission, smooth as silk, brakes, nice feel, very little body roll, & is just a kick to drive.  Again, you would have to spend much more to find an equal. I have read reviews where some complain the interior in not luxurious enough.  Again, for the price & comparable vehicles IMO it is quite acceptable.  The cabin for me, 5'9" and wife 5'5", the car is quite comfortable. The rear seats are again fantastic for the class. Our longest trip so far was 150 miles, enjoyed every minute and looking forward to longer road trips.  For its "class" of competitors there is no comparison. I was amazed trunk space is on par with wifes I30.  

FYI, I keep a car a long time. IE: 84 Mercedes 300 SD {this car was $40K in 1984}, kept it 10 years & 350,000 miles.  93 Saab 9000 CD turbo, 8 years & 200,000 miles{this car got the "driving experiance" juices in me flowing again} SO,,,I looked long and hard at mostly European mid 30K to Mid 40K cars and my general feeling was sadly, several of those manufactures {no names} had taken steps backwards.  
My wife has a Infiniti I30 & it is a great car but it never did anything for me other than the fact so far not one problem & has been trouble free. I have a co-worker that has a Q45 and he is quite brutal in his driving habits and has not broken anything on the Q, so on a whim, I went to look at the new Q45 & saw the G35, did a double take & went for a test drive and liked what I saw & felt.  I then spent a month doing research on the G. Having already done the research and shopping on the other brands over the last six months I decided to buy the G.  
I hope I can be as positive about my decision 200,000 miles from now.

This "review" is a first for me but I felt compelled to share this as Epinions was very helpful research tool. {even though there is not much information on the G35, I'm confident there will be in time}
