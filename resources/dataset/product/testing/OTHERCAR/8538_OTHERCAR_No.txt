            I purchased my Sebring in July of 1998 and have managed to put over 30,000 miles on it over the past year and a half.  The first several months I had the car, I did experience some trouble with the air conditioner on long trips.  Any time I would drive over an hour or so, the air conditioner would not seem to blow as it should.  For instance, even on high, you could put your hand up to the vent and the air was barely coming out.  You could here it as if a hose was loose, it sounded like it was blowing into the glove compartment.  Fortunately, I have not had that problem in quite some time now.

I bought the vehicle because I liked the overall look of it, a really sharp looking car.  When I first bought it, I remember coming out of the video store one evening to find a guy and his family walking around checking it out.  It also drives very well.  It's quiet, comfortable, and looks great.

The only gripes I have about the car are: 1) I think I paid a little too much for it because I'm not good at haggling ($400/mo for 6 yrs); 
2) Although I did put 25,000 miles on it the first year, I can't believe I had to replace my brake pads within a year of purchase (another instance of manufacturers cutting costs where you can't see it); 3)The front quarter panel ground effect fell off after a year but the dealer did fix that free of charge; 4) My driver side and passenger side rear view mirrors are fading to a grayish color on my black car.

Overall a great car, just try to get a better deal than I got!<br><br>
