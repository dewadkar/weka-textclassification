            I recently rented a Kia Sephia while some work was being done on my car. I looked forward to trying out the Kia since I'm considering purchasing another car soon. I was sadly disappointed. I was impressed with the visibility through the windshield and the amount of space in the interior of the car. However, living in Alaska as I do, there is often ice or snow on the roads. I was disappointed with the way the Kia handled. It seemed to lose traction much too easily and I found it difficult to regain control. Possibly, better tires might have helped. While the price of the Kia is good, it's easy to see where they skimped on the car. The interior looks cheap, and the body of the car seems very thin and light. That, combined with the poor handling did not bode well if I was in an accident. This car would be good for someone that doesn't have to deal with slippery road conditions who is just starting out.<br><br>
