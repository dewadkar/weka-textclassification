                          If you are out looking for a car that is in the price range of $19,000-$25,000, then think of getting a Grand Cherokee Laredo. One of the nice things about buying a laredo, is that it isn't nearly as expensive as the limited Cherokees, and looks about just like them. The limited's are also great but they have a lot higher price.

             This car runs very well, and is very smooth to drive. My mother is actually the one who owns it, so when I was picking it out with my father, this car really caught my interest. It is a great looking car, and has a nice interior. It has 4-wheel drive which is nice for my family since we live up in the mountains. The road to my house can be very slick at times, and this car has never had a problem getting up it. So if you are looking for a nice, and fun car to drive, consider buying a Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo.<br><br>
