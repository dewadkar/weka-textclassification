            my 94l COUPE IS THE BEST!  I purchased it with 68k miles on it and it rides better than or just as good as new... It has all the trimmings,power driver seats, memory seats 6 cd changer remote controls on steering wheel for audio,motorized door and trunk.. Note the motorized doors are only on the Coupe. It has awesome pick-up with 230 hp underneath the hood. The seats are the best and the interior is layed out excellent. When you think sports-luxury,this is the ultimate car!!! It's a shame Acura dropped this from it's production, they have never gained their reputation back in the US since dropping the Legend. The down side is , the repairs are very expensive,so be prepared to spend alot to get fixed.. But think of it this way, if you drive a Coupe you will not see many on the road which is good. I hate seeing my car everywhere I turn... This won't happen if you drive a Legend!!!!<br><br>
