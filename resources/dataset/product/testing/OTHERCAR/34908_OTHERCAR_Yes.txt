            Had for 9 months and put 27K miles on it.  Handling and acceleration much better than Dodge et all which was a major purchase consideration.  Only bug so far; loose front sway bar caused clunking.

Very good for road trips, although seats should be firmer.  Cloth interior has taken a "dog smell". would have preferred leather. Magic 3rd seat and GPS turned out to be BIG hits.  No need for maps anymore! Seems quiet to me although have heard road-noise complaints from others. trailer hitch (Hidden Hitch)/Bike rack are great. Sound system is poor-to-average (but that's fixable).

imho brakes seem underdesigned: rotors warp on long downhills, rotors glaze causing rumbling whenever things heat up.  Pads need replacement after 25K miles.  Wrong gearing for compression braking on long descents.
