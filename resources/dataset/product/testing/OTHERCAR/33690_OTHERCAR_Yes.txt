            I love my 1995 Buick Regal it is the best car I have ever bought.  I plan to keep this car for as long as it will let me.  I have the two door model and I have a fifteen month old child and there is plenty of room to get him in and out and plenty of leg room and even with 102000 miles it still drives great and keeps going and going.  I have had very minimal problems with this car and hope that it stays that way.  I would definitely buy another when I need an new one but I plan to keep this one til the wheels run off.  This would be a very good buy for anybody it is large enough for a small family and small enough for a single person.  This isn't your grandmothers Buick.  <br><br>
