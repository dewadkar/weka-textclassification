            I bought the Kodak DC-215 about a month ago as a present to myself. I had gone to Best Buy not knowing a thing about digital cameras and the girl suggested to me for just starting out this is a great camera. She explained everything to me fully and even demonstrated how to download the pictures and how quickly they download on to the computer. I was impressed. The sad thing was, at the time, they were sold out. A few days later I found the exact same camera at Wal-Mart, so i bought it there. The software that comes with the camera is very easy to use.
The camera came with a 4 mb memory card, which to me is plenty for me right now. It takes 4 AA batteries, which tend to run low very quickly, but I'm sure they do with any other digital camera.

The camera has many settings to it such as setting the date, how well of a quality picture you want, it even has a close up option, 10 second timer, red eye reduction and much more. After the picture is taken you can see the picture right away and you have the option to delete it or save it.

There are so many great selections and different things you can do with this camera, and for the price I think it is a great buy. There are some things I haven't done yet, such as printing a picture on photo paper, but will be doing that in the near future.

If you have never owned a digital camera before, I would definately recommend this one without a doubt!<br><br>
