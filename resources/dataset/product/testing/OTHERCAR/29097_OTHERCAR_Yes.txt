            Granted there are those of us in big cities who fight the traffic jams every day that want to drive a truck. We are the freeway warriors who want to drive a pickup, but know that the 4-wheel drive is not necessary on, for example, the 405 in L.A.
That's where the Toyota Tacoma comes in. This is a great little truck that is perfect for sitting on the freeway! I have been driving mine for almost a year, and I have yet to have any type of problem.
The handling is flawless, the brakes are dependable, the amenities are plenty, and the price well worth it. The bed is big enough to haul a large couch, but not big enough to keep you out of the one parking space at the mall that is always the only one you can find...(easily fits in compact spots)
Gas mileage is great, about $18.00 to fill the tank (as of aug. 2000). 
I would recommend this as a first truck to anyone who wants one...
It comes stick or automatic, a/c included, radio/tape player, bench or bucket seats (depending on model)...with other options too!
I hope I've helped, good luck!<br><br>
