            I bought my Saturn because it was the only car my Dad trusted. He owns a saturn as does my sister, and when we all drive someplace it looks like a saturn commercial. When I first went to the dealership I said to myself &quot;Wow, they aren't vultures&quot; which is something I noticed of other dealerships on getting customers. I actually sold cars for about 2 months (at a Honda Dealership) and stopped for this reason. I cannot attack poor defenseless people who just want to check out the cars.
Well they must not pay em by commision at Saturn because when we walked up to the lot, no one mauled us. Which was nice.
We were helped by a wonderful gentleman who didnt pressure us to buy. They had coffee, donuts and drinks in their lobby, and that just about did it for me.
No, I know nobody is going to buy a car for the complimentary snacks they serve at Saturn, but it kind of shows you what kind of service you are going to get when you have to return to the dealer. I enjoy maintenance runs because I can always sit and watch a movie or just hog out on donuts for a few hours.
We even went to a few of the &quot;Saturn Homecomings&quot; which is like a huge gathering of Saturn owners. They are very people oriented at Saturn and this is their best feature, oh and they make such cute little cars too.<br><br>
