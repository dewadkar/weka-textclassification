            I bought my second Infiniti this August.  It�s a 1999 Q45t.  I looked at everything else before I purchased this baby.  I test drove Mercedes, Jaguar, BMW, Lincoln and Cadillac � nothing compared to the Infiniti with respect the to Luxury for the price.

My Q45t is a beautiful sage color (I think they call it Pewter) with matching interior leather.  The pros and cons of the Q:

Pros
Smooth quiet ride
Not a lot of gimmicks (does have rear window shade, sports/luxury adjustment and adjustable headlamps)
Quality Engineering
Doesn�t look like every other luxury car
Excellent Handling
Wonderful Bose Stereo System
Lots of power

Cons
Likes to drink lots of Premium Fuel
The sports tires thump until they warm up

Overall the car is a great buy for the money, I�m sure Infiniti could get lots more if they advertised right.  This car is truly for the discriminating car buyer.  The first Q I had was a 1996, it seemed a bit heavier than the �99 and not quite as luxurious.  It was in an accident, hit the concrete barrier on the freeway going 70+ miles per hour, the car was totaled but I walked away without a scratch!  The car is safe!
