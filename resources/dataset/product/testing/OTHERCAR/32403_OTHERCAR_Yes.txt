            I love my 99 PURPLE hatchback.  I would have preferred blue, but this was all that was offered so I've convinced myself that it's the coolest color out there. :) The exterior of the car is nice.  It's sleek and smooth.  The interior is roomy (REALLY - I have a 6'4&quot; husband who fits with extra room) and comfortable.  I opted not to spring the $600 for a Honda AM/FM radio and instead installed a sony CD player (I'll review that soon!) for $200.  The car had speakers already, so that saved me some cash-ola.  The gas mileage is fantastic - even when I'm using my added feature of a/c.  Changing the oil is a bit of a reach (literally), but this is common in all Hondas. I spent the extra $100+ to get the rear cargo cover - personally, I think that should be included.  The tires also leave a little to be desired, but that's not a Honda issue, really.  With the exception of rainy weather (due to the tires), the car handles excellently.  I feel like I'm in a little sports car!  Parallel parking is a cinch.  I'd prefer power steering, but my biceps are all the better for not having it.  I miss the latch that could be pulled from the drivers side to open the hatchback, but I understand this had to be changed for safety purposes.  That's something that Honda is always excellent about - SAFETY.  I'm extremely pleased with my hatchback and will probably always be a Honda advocate!!  :) (look for my 98 Honda Civic Coupe review!)<br><br>
