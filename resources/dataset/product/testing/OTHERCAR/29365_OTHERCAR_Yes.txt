            With our new infant to consider, my wife and I bought a 1998 CRV in the summer of 1998. We wanted a family car that offered the fun and room of an SUV without being too cumbersome or inefficient. The CRV offered the perfect balance. 

For the three of us it is very comfortable. The driving position is very good, controls are easy to reach and to see, and driver visibility is great. The automatic is on the steering column, creating a lot of space between the driver and the passenger seat to set things. 

When friends are sitting in back, it's a little tight if the baby seat is there. But without the baby seat the back seems to offer as much legroom and seat comfort as the Honda Passport or the Isuzu Trooper.

The rear storage is very handy for day trips and is very easy to get in and out of. When the seats are folded down the back is fairly roomy. We've been very comfortable when laying in the back to watch a drive-in movie, for instance.  

The CRV is built on a Civic frame and has front-wheel drive, so it handles much more like a car than a truck. This is a very strong plus in my consideration.

This also means the CRV gets better gas mileage than most other SUVs (about 22mpg). I'm a little disappointed it's not better (I was hoping for the high 20's), but even the Passport only gets about 16.

Reliability has been extremely good. There are no loose bits and in the year and a half we've owned it the only visits to the shop have been for regular maintenance.

The main complaint I have seen from others is power. If your needs involve toting heavy weight, pulling any kind of trailers or going off-road, this is not the vehicle for you. I have also seen complaints about just comfortably maintaining highway cruising speed. In my experience this has not been a problem. I will admit to placing more importance on economy than on power, but the CRV does not have any shortage for our daily use. We live in the San Francisco area and have no trouble getting around the city, its hills, or the surrounding mountains with four adults, a child, and lots of junk in the back. 

You can get a better stereo by installing a custom system, but this one is good and has good resistance to jolts in the road.

Climate control is efficient and very quick to reach a comfortable temperature.

There are lots of nice little details which make the car more interesting. For instance, there is a tray between the driver and passenger seat which folds down for easy access to the rear seat (very important if you have kids). There is a second electrical outlet in the rear. The floor of the back pops out to become a picnic table. etc.

As you can see, I am very enthusiastic about this car and (except for the lower than desired mpg) would happily recommend it to anyone in the market for this type of vehicle. When looking at cars, I researched and drove the Toyota RAV4, Subaru Legacy Outback, Kia Sportage, Honda Passport, Isuzu Rodeo, Isuzu Trooper, Ford Explorer, Mitsubishi Montero and Chevy Blazer. With our purchase of the CRV there has not been a single regret.
