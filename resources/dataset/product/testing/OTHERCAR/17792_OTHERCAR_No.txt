            My mom actually bought this van because we had a big family and it's a big van, what a terrible mistake.  I hate this vehicle because everything goes wrong and I am doing everything I can to get the message out so other people don't encounter the same problem.  I will never buy a General Motors car again, right now my mom hasn't even finished paying off the van and the transmission died.  That is 2000 dollars to get replaced.  My mom used the car mostly for expressway driving so the transmission should've even lasted longer because of that, imagine how fast it would die during city driving.  My dad is the boss of thyson-dover a company bigger than all of GM, they bought astro vans for their company cars to their workers and 5 out of 10 of the transmissions died after the 50000 mile mark which is rediculous, my mom by the way had 63459 miles on her car.  The company refuses to pay for the new transmission on any of their vans.  So if you're buying this van or own one watch out for that 50,000 mile mark, because GM doesn't back their products.<br><br>
