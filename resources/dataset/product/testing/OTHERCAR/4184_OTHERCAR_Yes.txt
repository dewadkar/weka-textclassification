                 My husband and I traded one of the old Dodge Ramchargers for the new Dodge Minivan.  We worked a great deal on the trade in and got it for $18,000.  It is the basic model without any bells and whistles.  We have a radio with a tape player which the tuning and preset stations have gone nuts on us several times this does not include when the battery is disconnected and everything goes back to the factory settings.  We have two sets of bench seats that come out but are hard to push the buttons to release and then heavy to pull out, then the button to lock it back in is just as hard to secure.  
     The minivan is great on ride, gas and plenty of room inside for all, people and whatever you need to carry.  About a week or two after we got the van my husband noticed a noise under he didn't recognize and took it back to the dealer that we bought it from (Darcars, Marlowe Heights,MD) to see what they could do.  After they listened to it and said it was a normal noise we took it home only to snap the serpentine belt.  They had to tow it to their shop and fix it.  We took it back to them for the first maintenance service at which time they backed the van into the fence and my husband made them replace the bumper with a new one.  We then decided to take the van elsewhere for service and took it Waldorf Chrysler/Plymouth.  We took it to them for a maintenance service and mentioned we were still hearing the odd sound under the hood but weren't sure what it was.  They did the service and said that the noise was normal.  After taking it home and driving it for a few days I snapped the serpentine.  Again they had to tow and fix it.  Again my husband insisted that he still heard an odd noise and they finally adjusted the tensioner on the belt and the noise went away.  
     We also have the possesed windshield wipers as I see many other have.  Dodge has replace the motor twice for us and we still have it at 100,000 miles so it must just be in the system somewhere. At this mileage we are starting to have leaky valve covers so we are constantly filling up the oil.  My husband has done the maintenance on the vehicle since we passed the warranty 70,000 miles.  Overall we have had a good experience with the van itself.  It has never left us anywhere and it still runs smoothly.  Our worst experiences have been with the dealers and their incompetant workers.  (We also had it serviced at County Chrysler/Plymouth, Upper Marlboro and the second time they had it one of the mechanics drove too close to a pole in the service bay and scratched the entire drivers side and tried to say it wasn't they didn't do it.)
