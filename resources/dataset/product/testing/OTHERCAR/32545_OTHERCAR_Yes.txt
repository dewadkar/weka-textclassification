            While not an avid photographer, I do enjoy the art and every now and again find myself seeking out new and better alternatives to my current 2-year-old Olympus C-3000.  One such alternative showed up amongst my dear mother&#146s Christmas gifts and after fiddling with it I must say I&#146m officially jealous. 

The Kodak EasyShare DX6490 Digital Camera is a great value at something less than $500.  Sounds strange, eh?  But consider for a moment that the camera does what very few others do on the market.  It takes pictures with a 10x optical zoom lens.  There are very, very few consumer-level models that offer this feature.  But whereas many other cameras (including my dear old Olympus) are pretty difficult to get a handle of this one is definitely meant to be user-friendly.  For ease of use, impressiveness of features, and price this Kodak model is as good as you can get.

No, it&#146s not a professional level (with only 4.0 megapixels) and not it&#146s not the product of a famous digital camera maker but it does impress on most every level. And sometimes you just gotta go for the actual quality and value over brand name, hence the purchase of the DX6490.  Do I like it better (gasp!) than my Olympus C-3000?  Heck yeah.  Would I run out and buy it immediately for myself immediately and without hesitation?  Double heck yeah.

First and foremost, the camera is easy.  Who would have thought that such a powerful machine would be so easy to deal with?  Not me, therefore I found myself absolutely impressed by how simple it is to operate.  From taking pictures to viewing the images to finally transferring to a computer and/or printing the process is easy and relatively seamless.  As with many digital cameras, the actual picture taking is made possible with a combination of dial and button operations.  But what separates this from my Olympus is that it doesn&#146t really take much &#147fiddling&#148 to get things right.  Planted directly on the dial are presets for regular automatic picture taking in addition to manual, sport, night, landscape, portrait, and close-up (macro) modes.  There are settings for any situation at the flick of your thumb.

While in manual mode (where most of the bonus settings are accessible and appropriate) lucky owners may choose to adjust both aperture and shutter speed settings.  Here you can also choose to change exposure time, ISO speed (from 80 to 800), color mode (saturated and neutral color, sepia, and black and white), image sharpness, exposure metering type, and focus zone format.  If there&#146s a picture you want to take, the DX6490 can satisfy.

Not only are the actual controls functional, easy, and flexible but the LCD screen is brilliant and beautiful (if that is indeed positive).  It doesn&#146t glitch or skip&#151as you look at an image in real life it appears the same on the screen.   The 2.2&#148 LCD screen is large and bright and representative of the end result.  While taking photos outside in the brightness of both sun and snow it was easy to see.  The same goes for indoor viewing.  

Speaking of looking good, the Kodak also has a video option.  It works well and easily and can handle a pretty good deal of video of course contingent on the size of the memory you&#146ve installed in the system.  One word of warning though&#133unless you like incessant clicking turn off the automatic focus before taking video.

But there is more to this camera than technical benefits.  The Kodak DX6490 also includes (as do all Kodak EasyShare models) a docking station. This isn&#146t a standard feature for most models, but is an added bonus here.  After installing the software (a simple, standard step-by-step process) just plug in the unit to your USB and set the camera into the base.  Open the software and push the clearly marked button on the front of the unit&#133your pictures will be viewable and downloadable from the camera almost immediately.  Ahhhh&#133the joy of USB.  

This Kodak is also very light.  It is easy to carry as a result of Kodak&#146s choice to include a high-capacity lithium-ion battery rather than requiring AA batteries.  The base fully charges the built-in battery in less than three hours.  It promises to last for upwards of 300 pictures, and there has been no indication that this isn&#146t indeed the truth.  In fact, it seems that Kodak has underestimated their camera&#146s performance.  But as with all batteries, the lithium-ion doesn&#146t promise to last forever.  This was a major concern.  What happens when it dies?  What do we do?  Batteries are indeed replaceable (something that may need to be done after three or four years of usage) for $30.  Consider for a moment how many AA batteries you can go through in the same time period--$30 is actually a very good bargain.

Included in the package are the following things:  camera (of course), dock, AV cable, USB cable, neck strap, lens cap and tether, lithium ion battery, power cord, software CD, and a friendly &#147welcome kit.&#148  There are of course a few optional items available from printers to added memory (it comes with a built-in 16MB chip but is compatible with SD memory cards) to a rapid charge kit.  But the things included are more than enough to get any usual photographer up and going.

Overall and thus far I&#146ve been incredibly impressed and subsequently incredibly jealous of the Kodak EasyShare DX6490 Digital Camera.  I can&#146t say enough about how good a bargain it is.  It may not be a proper choice for a professional photographer, but for casual photographers it is a wonderful choice&#151if you can stomach coughing up the initial $500.
