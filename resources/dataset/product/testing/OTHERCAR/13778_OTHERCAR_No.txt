               The only reason I purchased the Dodge Ram 1500 V-6 short bed truck is,  Dodge financing was the only one that was willing to work with my down and get my payments where I wanted them.  Now I know why.  

I have had 4 steering gear boxes put on the truck in the last 14 months.  According to the Dodge mechanics that I talk to, there is a known problem with that particular part on the 4X2 truck.  Also, now I found out that there is a problem with the fuel sending unit in the fuel tank.  

The  sending unit used to be a stand alone part, but now it is attached to the fuel pump itself.  Now when the sending unit goes, you have to replace the fuel pump also, not a cheap item to replace.  I have filed a complaint with Washington on the steering gear box, but have not yet got any response on the number or repair attempts that it takes to have the vehicle fall under the &quot;Lemon Law&quot; for the state of Texas.  

Also there is a safety clause that goes along with the &quot;Lemon Law&quot; but can get no one to clarify to me exactly what the safety standard is on the steering gear box.  At one point I had approximately 3 1/2 to 4 inches of movement in the steering wheel before the tires would ever start turning.  Driving in the Ft Worth and Dallas traffic everday is not a safe place for this to be in affect.  Thank you for reading this if you do....<br><br>
