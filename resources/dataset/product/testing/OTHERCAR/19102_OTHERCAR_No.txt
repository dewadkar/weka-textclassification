            We bought our Kia Sportage thinking we would have a great new SUV with a good warranty and spend little on gasoline with less fill ups.  Fortunately we were partially correct, but we had a long future of problems ahead.  Thank goodness for the warranty!

The first thing to go wrong on the vehicle was the fly wheel, covered by the warranty.  The drive shaft was replaced several times at one service center then taken to another service center where they informed us it had been replaced backwards at the other service center, also covered by warranty.  The belts always made noise so we asked about them needing to be tightened or something at the first service center soon after purchasing the vehicle and they gave us a can of silicone spray and told us they couldn't do anything to help it.  The heat shields are a constant problem to this day (5 years later).  They still rattle.  We have had one or two of them removed.  There is a noise coming from where the luggage rack is bolted to the roof by the right side back passenger door.  The radio has been replaced enough times to get us to realize we just needed to go to a local electronics store and purchase a new one from there.  Are you getting the picture yet?

Since neither of the Kia dealers have been able to sufficiently help us we have started to take it to a local repair shop and are having great help from them.  They seem to know a lot more about the vehicle than the repair personnel at the dealerships!  

We do get good mileage from the car, the seats are comfortable and the A/C has not given us any trouble.  For these things we are counting our blessings.
