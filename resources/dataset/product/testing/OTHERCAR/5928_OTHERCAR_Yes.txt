            Well what can I say, it is a car and it does move me from Point A to Point B rather well. I am an aggressive driver and it works well for that. It's nice and safe. Mine has been hit a few times and it keeps on ticking. I've put about 100,000 miles on it and it hasn't really given me any trouble. Sure I had to have a couple of things replaced but it was minor. The AC works like a charm, but the speakers are starting to give out from excessive loud music. Sure, they still work but you can hear a little rumbling and it really doesn't like bass much anymore, and car music is rather important to me :) Ofcourse anyone can make an investment and get a better system installed. This is my car for getting my groove on, getting my bills paid, and getting on with my life. I got it for a good price. It Rocks! Buy one and we can ride out together!<br><br>
