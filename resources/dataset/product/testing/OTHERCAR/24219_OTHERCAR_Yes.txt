            Ambivalence:  Simultaneous Love and Hate.  This is a perfect description of how I feel about the Dakota after 9 years of ownership.  It was heaven for the first 6 years, now our relationship has gone the other way.  Sounds like marriage......  Only it took longer to go to hades.

I bought the Dakota in mid 1994.  I liked most everything about it and it filled my need for a truck.  Note:  I am not a truck person; I like cars.  I drive my SHO and Corvette whenever I can and only use the truck for work or towing.  

I soon discovered the Dakota has an abnormally large turning radius and the brakes just don't stop it very quickly.  I'm comparing this to other 4wd's I've owned.  The seat comfort is good and I have covered 1000 miles in a day without any suffering.  The a/c is cold and the heater rules.  Never any problems with heater, a/c or dash switches or electrics.

The factory stereo failed at 5 years and I replaced it with a Sony top of the line CD unit.  Not Recommended.  The unit has no bass response and skips on smooth roads.  It also beeps everytime you kill the ignition and requires disassembly of the dash to disable the infernal tones.  They tell me this is to remind you to take the face plate and heave it, I presume.

The Dakota was selected primarily as a work vehicle to get people and equipment to remote job sites and secondary as a tow vehicle for my 5500 pound boat.  The Dakota performed admirably in both roles.  Plus, it could easily get the boat up the steepest ramps.  It drank a lot of gas, but the boat was real heavy.  I could run the air conditioning on hot days and the Dakota never over-heated.  It could also pull the boat up any hill at 65 mph.

Off road the Dakota is in its element.  Equipped with Wilderness A/T's it can handle mud and snow with aplomb.  Good ground clearance and plenty of torque.  

The gas mileage is poor under all circumstances.  I never exceeded 15 mpg in city driving and 17 highway, with the average closer to 13 over the past few years.  Tires do not last long due to the fact the Dakota will not hold alignment and the tie rod ends wear out quickly.

The 4 wheel drive has worked perfectly and smoothly each time I engaged it.  I installed the factory cruise control myself after about 3 weeks of no cruise.  Piece of cake.  It was easy and the instructions were great.  I'm an engineer, not a mechanic, so it had to be easy.

All in all, the Dakota was very reliable up to 120,000 miles.  No maintenance other than oil changes, brake pads, front rotors a couple times, tires and wheel alignment.  It went to the dealer one time at 70K for the TSB for the Tail Gate cold weather problem and a failed fuel gauge.  I never had a warranty claim.

At about 120K it had to have the front end rebuilt, shocks and springs for $1400.  Then it needed a starter for $220.  More front end work $500.  Belts, hoses, plugs (original set replaced) and rear drums... $400.  At 145K the tranny failed and required a $1700 rebuild.  Engine is still strong, but with 150K on it, who knows how long.  The fuel gauge failed again, but the low fuel warning still works.  I figure I need to look for the gas station when the trip meter reads 260 miles on the 20 gallon tank.

All in all, the Dakota is a reliable and moderately comfortable medium size pick up.
