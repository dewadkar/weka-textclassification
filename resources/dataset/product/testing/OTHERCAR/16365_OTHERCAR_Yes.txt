            I have never used a camera which made it so easy to take great pictures.  The HP C200 digital camera was ready-to-go right out of the box; well, after I added batteries of course.  I particularly liked the simple but accurate quick-start directions:  of course you want to use your new toy right away!  Who wants to read the book first?

The interface is much easier to understand than those of the digital cameras which I have used at work.  The zoom feature gives you a better idea of what the picture will turn out like if you edit it to &quot;enlarge&quot;, etc.  The buttons on the top are placed so that you don't accidentally get your finger in a lot of pictures trying to adjust everything and then take your picture, a problem for me with old fashioned cameras.

If I were designing my dream camera, there are a few features about the HP C200 that would be different.  I would make it so that I could review pictures already taken without having to turn the camera off first, and take pictures while reviewing them without having to turn it back on.  And I would definitely make the little plastic cover that goes over the batteries stay on better!

I am also glad that we bought a SanDisk drive rather than rely on the download from the camera.  Downloading the pictures is a very slow process!  Do yourself a favor, spend the extra bucks and get the drive.  It's worth it!<br><br>
