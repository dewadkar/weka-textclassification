            So my Forester now has 41,000 miles in it. About a month ago it started making an &quot;airy high pitched hum&quot; when I was cruising down the freeway at a consistent speed between 60 and 70 mph. When I had it at the dealer today to get the oil changed I was told - It's under warranty - The rear deferential is heating up - we ordered the part. Don't drive it. If it freezes up you have to pay to fix it! What? So they'll fix it. What's going to happen at 80,000 when it's not under warranty? 

Okay, we live 1/2 mile up a gravel road (It's getting paved this week). Some people consider it an environment that's hard on cars. That's why I bought this Forester.  But in the rainy winters the brakes are squealing all the time. Dealer said high pressure wash them with a hose. That might help sometimes. It's annoying. 

Plus I have rubber mats - But the carpet still wore through to the floor in two spots where I rest my left foot. 

The back hatch rattles for every little bump all the time. The dealer charged me to lubricate it once and the rattle stopped for 2 days. 

I miss my 10 year old Honda.
