            I had always wanted a Jeep Cherokee. So when it came time that I needed a vehicle to get to college and get around I was focused on a Jeep.

My Cherokee is a 96 SE, 4 door. Had 66,000 miles on it. It is a 4x4 V6 Automatic. Has cruise, power locks, power windows, A/C, CD player, tilt, rear defog and the trailer towing package. Overall I'm very satisfied with this car. It's hunter green with a red line down the bottom side. I'm sure you've seen a comparable one.

The pickup on this Cherokee is better then most trucks I've driven thanks to it's 6.0L V6. The handling is also very good.

It's ride is for the most part smooth, can get a little rocky from time to time depending on road conditions. On the expressway the pickup is good. No problem getting it up above 90mph (not that you should drive at this rate...). 

The front bucket seats are very comfortable for those long drives. Cruise controls seems to work very well, with no big losses or gains in speeds while climbing or descending down a hill.

On the fly 4x4 is great for those rough conditions. The Cherokee shines in rough weather; steering and handing is great in the snow.

Some caveats? 
-------------
Well Jeep decided not to update the interior for the Cherokee until 1997. So if you look inside say a '96 and a '92 you'll notice very little change to the &quot;cockpit&quot;. While if you look at other cars from comparable years you'll notice that they're a little more up-to-date then the Cherokee. The powerlock/windows system also didn't get updated until 1997 so don't be surprised if it looks a little, how do I say, ghetto. Oh and no cup holder. Overall not a big deal.

Driving at high speeds, above 75mph we'll say can be a little loud, not too bad though overall. Will just need to play your radio a bit louder then say a slow drive in the city.

Be careful of the doors. One thing hopefully you wont have to find out is that the doors are not the strongest, get a heavy person leaning against your car and you may find a indentation staring at you when they get off. The doors do not seem to pop back out very well if this happens. You'll have to get it fixed professionly or risk chipping some paint by yourself to fix it.

Gas mileage. Well it's a Jeep. This has to be expected. I do get about 20mpg on the expressway though which isn't all that bad. The city driving that gets you.

Through and through I'm very satisfied with this Cherokee and would recommend it to anyone who wants a solid all-terrain vehicle.<br><br>
