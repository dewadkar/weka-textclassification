                My Toyota Corolla is a beautiful machine. It looks like it's about to fly off the road and cruise through the clouds, and, with it's smooth ride, it feels as though it's already running its tires through the cumulus. 
    Not only that, but every time I put the key in and turn it, it starts up right away. And, even though all the warning lights in the dashboard (check engine, airbag problems, etc.) seem to flash on and off entirely of their own volition, the car continues functioning entirely independent of its electrical warning systems. 
     The undercarraige is also remarkably durable. Just the other day I ran over a raccoon on a small two lane road. The underside of the car was still in remarkably good condition despite the rather large crack as the ill-fated little fellow met his fate on what would be his highway of doom. I can't say the same for the unfortunate creature. 
     We all make bad decisions sometimes, like not buying a Toyota Corolla, for instance. 
     I've had it for a year, and though I've already put 20,000 miles on it with only one tune-up, (bringing it up to 50,000 since it already had 30k on it when I bought it) it still runs remarkably well. This car has the endurance of a wild stallion in the passionate throes of reproductive lovemaking.
