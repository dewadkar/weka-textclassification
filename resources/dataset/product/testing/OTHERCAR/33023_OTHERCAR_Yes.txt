            I bought my 95 Dodge Avenger on October 15, 1998.  I bought this car for a couple of different reasons.  First handling in the winter months.  This car has very good traction on snow and ice, when driving on an ice covered road other drivers were at a speed of 30-40 mph, while I could drive safely at the speed limit.  I was used to the handling of a Geo Storm in the winter.  I was in the ditch more than on the road.  The avengers width makes you feel more stable and safe on snow and ice.  The car is also equipped with standard ABS which keeps the vehicle from sliding when applying brakes.  Although when it is slippery and the ABS kick in the car is very jerky.  Second the car is very roomy without being a 4-door.  It has room but also a sporty body.  The ground effects make it look more sporty but also make for low clearance and often scrape curves when parking.  Now that I've had my car for over 2 years the ground effects need to be replaced for that reason.  One of the reasons for purchasing the vehicle was because of the good gas mileage but as the miles have gone up over 100,000 the gas mileage has decreased greatly, although driving more in the city also makes a difference.  

I have had many problems with the car also.  After I purchased the vehicle I have had many problems with the computer in the car.  I have paid almost as much on repairs for the car as I originaly paid for the car itself.  When driving there is a noticeable delay in the gears shifting.  This could also be why the vehicle is not getting very good gas mileage.

Over all I like the way the vehicle handles and the roominess it provides.  I would recommend this vehicle for someone in college or someone looking to start a family soon.  Make sure if you buy the vehicle used that you have a mechanic or someone with some car smarts check over your car before you decide to purchase it.  If you don't you may be paying more for the repairs than you origionaly paid for the car.<br><br>
