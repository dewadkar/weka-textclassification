            I bought the Epson Photo PC 750Z in March 1999.  I took it to Hawaii with me and made over 400 pictures.  All of the pictures were fabulous. 
I'm not an photographer, just average, but the camera made me look like an expert.  

Things I like about this camera:
Long battery life
You can use the sun to recharge in daylight!
Great software for downloading and working with images
Has both digital and optical zoom lens
Easy to use.

Things Epson could improve on:
Lens cover is a pain in the neck to keep up with. It's attached with a cord, but it comes off the lens easily. Hangs in the way when making pictures. I would prefer a camera with a hard lens cover that shuts mechanically when you turn off the camera.
Software could include a way to trim pictures in inches such as 4 X 6, instead of just in pixels.
