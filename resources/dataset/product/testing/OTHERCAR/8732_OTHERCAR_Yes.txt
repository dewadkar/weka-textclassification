            Then read no more!  The Epson 850Z was my final choice after two months of reading reviews.  Last month I took the plunge and bought one.  This review will not be a technical review.  There are plenty of techie reviews out there.

This camera's price is usually around $650.00.  I paid $571 from Buy.com.  Check FREQUENTLY with them, their prices fluctuate.  When the camera arrived, my first action was to charge the batteries.  Follow the instructions when charging so that the life can be maximized.  By the way, after 70 pictures and about 10 downloads, the charge is still strong. I finally had to charge the batteries after 100 shoots. I was caught with dead batteries due to the LCD display. It showed that I had 50% power left when I actually had zero.

While charging the batteries, software installation can be done on your PC, which is simple and fast.  The image transfer software is fast, even if you are using a serial port.  USB is preferred, but my PC does not have a USB port.  The editing software is provided by SierraImaging.  It is very intuitive to use.  Editing is a snap.  Zooming in and out is a little slow on this camera

Once you have mastered downloading the images to your PC and editing, the photographer can soon begin to master the many other features on this camera.  Watch for my other articles when I discuss my experiences.  Until then, STOP reading reviews and buy this camera.

For your consideration:  Other cameras closely considered were Olympus D620l and Olympus 2020.<br><br>
