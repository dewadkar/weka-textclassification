            My husband and I bought this vehicle 3 months before our son was born. We bought it because of the incredible reputation Saturn has for customer service and safety.  The price was very affordable, and the car very attractive. Last year, I gave birth to twin girls.  I was extremely saddened by the thought of getting rid of our Saturn for a mini van.  I meausured car seats, hummed and hawed over what to do, and finally found some that would fit.  Saturn cars have reinforced doors, so I know my kids are safe. I have three car seats in the back seat that fit nicely.  My saddie-Saturn, that is her name (we named her) drives beautifully, has excellent pick up, and has never had any mechanical problems yet.  It now has 85,000 miles on it and is a 1996.  I recommend this vehicle to almost everyone.  However, if you are a very tall legged family, you may want to opt for the Saturn Midsize that has recently come out.  

I wouldn't purchase the paint color we have again though. It is called black gold and is highly easy to scratch.  Maybe the scratches just show up more because of the color. 

All in all, a beautiful, and incredibly safe car for both families, and singles. <br><br>
