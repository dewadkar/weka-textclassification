            I own the 360L and my cousin I came to find out owns the 340R the camera shell is identicle. The functionality is nearly Identicle, the features are few in between. 

Both these cameras offer great quality pictures, while the 360L offers a few more modes in resolution than the 340 does they both take  awesome pictures. These cameras both come with panaramic, both have redeye reduction, both use the memory card, both have 2x digital zoom and multi frame shooting.

The features the 360L carries that the 340R dosn't is the extra resolutions, a slow overexposure setting for the shutter, a focus dot on your screen, background brightening and darkening, and automatic file naming on the camera. I had a chance to use the 340R a while over christmas when I showed up at a house with a camera looking identicle to my cousins. 

So now having used both.. I know the differences and the likenesses.
As well as the fact that both these cameras take some great pictures..
