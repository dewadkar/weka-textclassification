            So my wife has decided the second baby means the old Subaru is just not big enough. Well much to my dismay, I really liked the all wheel drive and wagon storage. I had to agree with her. Last trip to Acadia National park it was really crowded in the little Subaru and with another bambino I was getting a little claustrophobic already. So we started a massive web and land search for a new replacement. Now her parents have a Ford product known as the Windstar. She likes them but.... I just don't get it. the nose where the engine goes looks like it just doesn't belong there. So on to other vehicles. We found the Chevys and GMC products a little wanting but found many people in our situation swear by the GM product. Now I have a beautiful Dodge Diesel truck, Cummins technically is a Ford product but the body and running gear is the Dodge. And I have really been quite happy with this magnificent piece of art work. So I'm leaning for the Caravan. Well we (read I) go to the dealerships and check out the digs. Well about 7/10ths of the way through a standard speech and lay in for a lease I hear the works &quot;residual value&quot; ........ Well my friends that is one of those catch words that should catch everyone's attention who is looking for a new car or vehicle. In anyones dictionary next to the phrase &quot;residual value&quot; should read     DEPRECATION.     Yes needless to say I was crushed to find my new Minivan after minimal use over 36 months would loose some 49% of it's sticker value. Hey that's close to $12,500 dollars!, STOP THIEF!!!!. No thank you I'll opt for the used model thank you. Well just so happens I find the vehicle we've been looking for. a 96 grand caravan LE loaded to the hilt. 60K miles ( a little high but manageable) Yes I bought it the ride was better than a new one off the lot. The LE has a better ride and smoother transmission. The comforts of the Grand LE are way to numerous to mention but they are plush and fun to drive with.  A must is the tinted glass and AC with a good radio. The Overhead has a trip computer and temp and compass. Oh what fun when the road gets really boring. 
I'll have to write some more opinions about this as time goes on but so far it has been really good vehicle. I'll keep you posted. <br><br>
