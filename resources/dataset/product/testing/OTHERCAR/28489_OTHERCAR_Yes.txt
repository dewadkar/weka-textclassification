            I am a reluctant Jeep driver.  It was not an SUV I sought to buy, but was the only 4wd on a short list of company vehicle choices.  I expected the worst, held my nose, and ordered a brand new 2002 Special Edition.

I expected cheesy trim, rattles, and many visits to the dealer for repairs.  I got none of that, in fact, it has become my preferred vehicle, even over my Mercedes ML320 -- (I know, I know, but it's true).  This is my 3rd SUV and definitely my favorite (Honda Passport was the other).

While one of the reviews here cites mechanical defects, I've experienced none in the 10,000 miles I've driven it.  The engine and transmission are not nearly as smooth as my Merc ML320, but I didn't expect them to be and they are certainly acceptable. 

The ride is better than any of the other SUV's I've owned.  It's much more forgiving on rough pavement.  The engineers at Daimler-Chrysler have done a great job at taming a suspension system designed to handle the demands of off-road.  I remain very impressed with the ride --  remember, too, this is a REAL SUV, not a Toyota Camry with a big trunk. 

The seating is much softer than that to which I had been accustomed and initially gave me a floating, out of control feeling. After 6 months, however, I've grown to love, even prefer the seating of the Jeep.

The dash is great.  No-nonsense, clutter free, and masculine.  The steering wheel has an unmistakable masculine feel as well--  you know you're not driving a minivan. 

The Special Edition isn't exactly luxurious.   The interior upholstery is barely acceptable for a vehicle in this price range and could definitely use an upgrade.  The stereo with the 10 disc changer is OK, but won't impress you if you really like music.  

One of the nicest, but probably most underappreciated features of this vehicle is the way the rear seats fold down.  On both my other SUVs, the headrests must be removed, meaning that they are left rattling around in the back somewhere.  The Jeep's fold forward and remain attached -- brilliant.

There is something innately masculine about the Jeep that is very appealing.  Even the door handles are designed with an ample grip and satisfying mechanism.  My wife likes the Jeep, but clearly not as much as I do.

The Jeep appears to burn no more or less gas than either of the other two SUVs I've owned, but is certainly quieter and better built than the Honda Passport (which is actually a re-badged Isuzu) and is as-quiet as the ML320. The Mercedes wins for mechanical smoothness, except for the suspension - the Jeep wins by a landslide on that note.

It's admittedly a little unfair for me to rate a vehicle that I didn't spend my own money on, but then again if I had, I wouldn't have bought a Jeep.  Would I buy one now? Absolutely - it has far, far, exceeded my expectations.  Would my wife  buy one? -- perhaps not - she'd probably buy a Mercedes C240 sedan for the same money, but then again, she has no masculine itch to scratch in the first place...
