                The Saturn sedan is continuously improving, and is becoming more of a family car.  This is the second Saturn that I have owned, and the improvements are astonishing.  They are adding new features and changing the body shape to make the car more like what the people want.  

    There are still several improvements that could be made on this Saturn.  The car is very loud and is poorly mounted causing a lot of vibration to all of the passengers.  Every time the car hits a speed of 27 mils per hour; the passenger side window starts to vibrate. The brakes have a propensity to make a loud noise, especially when the car is not sufficiently warmed. Also, it is a hassle to get in and out of the car because there is not much room in the front or back.  This car is only good for 2 people, and if you have kids, they should be relatively young.  It is very cramped trying to fit four full size adults in this car. 

    Despite all of these weaknesses, the car has a very good upside.  The car gets great gas mileage.  It is a very reliable car, as long as you keep servicing it regularly, you wonï¿½t have any problems with it.  It has dent resistant plastic on the exterior so that minor collisions with other car doors or shopping carts wont cause a dent or a chip in the paint.

     	    The interior of the car is very consistent with the rest of 
the car.  It is not the best quality, but it is not the cheapest material on the market.  It is very nicely color coordinated, and the seats are very soft.  There are two average sized cup holders underneath the radio.  The sound system surprised me, because I was expecting it to be a lot weaker than it was.  It has nice sized speakers with some good bass in the front and rear.  It is very easily accessible by the driver or the passenger.  

	   The exterior is much better than in comparison to the interior.  Their new plastic body on the outside keeps the car in extremely nice shape.  I personally like the shape of the car.  It is nice and aerodynamic, and it has a black strip along the bottom of the doors to prevent against those nasty door collisions by other people.  This strip also acts as a part of the design, along with protecting the body of the car.  There is ample trunk space for a small car.

	   Overall, this car is a good buy for someone who is looking for a reliable car at a fair price.  The quality of the Saturn is continuously improving, and in the next few years it will become one of the best selling compact cars around.  It is very affordable, and is good for a new family with small children.  I would recommend this to any and all of my friends and readers.
