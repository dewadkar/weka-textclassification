            I had been eyeing the Grand Prix GTP since Pontiac redid it in 1997.  Mostly the GTP is what caught my attention.  Supercharged V6 that puts out 245 ponies and it was four door, yes sir!  I couldn't think of one car that had four doors and had this kind of power... under 30k.  Heck, under 40k!  So when I was able to buy it in August, 2000, I was very excited.  I knew I wanted this car and didn't even to test drive it, but I did.  Three hours later, it was mine!

<B>First Impressions</B>  My first impression of the car was one of amazement.  I just couldn't get over how much power it had and well it handled it.  The car was roomy inside and friends would comment on how comfy it was in the back.  The radio was pretty darn good for an OEM one and the dual climate control was just too cool.  My wife was cold, she had the heater on.  I was hot, I had the AC on.  Very cool.

<B>Overall Impressions</B>  Ok, now I've had this car for nearly a year and have put 18,000 miles on it, I think I can give a pretty fair run down.  The car still makes me smile every time I pound on the gas peddle and I leap in front of everybody.  Passing people isn't even a thought anymore, it just does it.  The interior is nice and pleasant.  The gas mileage isn't bad if you don't use the Supercharger all the time.  But...

There are a few things that bug me about this car.  The first and I think the stupidest part is there is the Sunroof button is not lit up at night.  So, you fumble in the dark pushing the buttons, map light goes on, another one goes on, oh, there it is.  How stupid and just plain cheap is that?  Come on GM, it would have cost, what, two dollars tops to put it in!?

Another thing that bothers is me is the front seat and how it rises the closer it is to the steering wheel.  Being that I was in a serious car accident prior to this, I now sit closer to the steering wheel as my back was messed up and it's hard to let my arms extend.  So, the closer I get, the seat elevates and my head comes so close to the roof, my hair rubs it.  The seats are powered, instead of creating an elevation by slopping the seat higher, they could have left the rail level and added a height adjustment to the seat.

The only other thing that bothers me is the leather isn't the best of quality.  Sure it's not a Mercedes, but they could have made it a little better.

I listed front wheel as a con because I don't like how it's hard to handle when you step on the gas.  The wheels want to go every where but straight.  You don't have this problem in rear wheel drive, but it's something one has to accept in this day of gas conscious cars.

<B>Response to Other epinions Here</B>  I've seen comments about the control stick being too far away from the steering wheel.  I don't have this problem and can't figure out why this person did.  It was a rental, so maybe the car was defective?  Also, the power locks will lock all doors <I>except</I> the drivers door if the keys are in the ignition.  If they keys are out, they all lock.  I think this is a nice feature.
