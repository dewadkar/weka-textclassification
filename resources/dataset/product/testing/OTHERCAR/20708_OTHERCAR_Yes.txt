               As the proud owner of an Acura Integra, I can tell you that it is very much worth its price tag, and I might go as far as to tell you that for the money, buying one of these is a steal. The integra is the cheapest car in the acura series but that does make it any less of a monster on the road. 
   
   It's base engine in the non-type r series is an inline 4 - 1.8 liter engine which generates 140 horsepower. That is a lot of horsepower for a small engine. Acura is known to make smaller engines which generate more horsepower and also burn gas efficiently. This engine is really all you need for a great sports car. The car does not weigh very much at all. The engine also gives off a very nice sound. 

   Then you have the type R series which adds around 30 more horsepower and makes it a real sports car. It is a slightly different engine build and is worth the extra money which really isn't that much. 

   However, if you're buying the integra as a sports car, I would not recommend buying the type R but rather I would save that money and get it converted. The integra is one of the easiest cars to convert, meaning that changing the exhaust system, supercharging, turbocharging, nice spoilers, cool paint jobs are all quite easy to do on an integra. They even have a few of these upgrades at certain dealerships. 

   The integra does have a few downsides though. The interior leaves much to be desired. Most cars in the LS series, unless upgraded, come with cloth interior. The GS series has leather seats, which are really base leather and aren't too comfortable. Again, if you're into leather seats, I would get an LS series and ask the dealership to put in they're own leather seats; it will be extra, but it will be well worth it. Also, there is really no wood-grain interior in the car, maybe a little on the shifter. Basically, the whole interior of the car makes it look like a Kia, and not an Acura. 

   However, there is a reason for this. Most people who buy the car, buy it for its sporty look and for its speed, as well as the ability to upgrade it. They do not buy it for its comfortable interior. If you want a comfortable interior, then you are going to have to dish out some extra money. I would then look at something like a CL type series. 

   So who is the integra made for. It is made for those of us who do not have a lot of money to spend but want a car that looks call and drives fast, those of us who will worry about cushiony interiors when we get older. For now, we want something cool, therefore, we buy integras. <br><br>
