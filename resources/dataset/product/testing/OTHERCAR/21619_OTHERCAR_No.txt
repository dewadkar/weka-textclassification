            With the amount of money we have sunk into repairing my wife's '94 Grand Cherokee Laredo, we could have bought a small commuter vehicle.  While it drives nicely and looks great, steer clear of a Grand Cherokee if you are in the market for an SUV.

If you do buy a Grand Cherokee, you had better start looking for a quality Chrysler dealership (and let me know when you find one!).  Consumer Reports doesn't rank the Grand Cherokee well in the reliability department, and there is good reason for that.

My wife received this as her first vehicle in high school, so it is a car that we continue to use since we cannot affort to buy a new vehicle at this time (I am currently in grad school).  However, looking back on it, the repairs over the last 2 years would have probably paid for a used commuter car.

Since we have been married (for about 1.5 years), these are the problems we have had: (1) Replace the tracking arm.  This is a DANGEROUS vehicle to drive on bumpy roads if the tracking arm goes out. Cost: $150 (replaced by a trusted [read non-Chrysler] mechanic  (2)Replaced another part of the steering/linkage 4 months later.  Cost: $200 (also replaced by non-Chrysler mechanic).  (3) Replaced nearly every part of the A/C system.  Cost: $1500 (this was taken to 2 different Chrysler dealers on 3 separate visits before it was fixed properly...we were charged each time).  (4) Fixed electrical wiring in the doors: window buttons would not work.  Cost: $250 (dealt with honestly/competently at a Chrysler dealership--unusual).  Passenger window now starting to fritz again. (5) Replaced rotors and other parts on breaks.  Cost: $300  (later found out that this part had been recalled, and dealership refused to tell us about this...many calls later to Chrysler finally got most of our money back).  Prior to our marriage, I know that my wife routinely had this vehicle in the shop.  If you printed out its shop history, it would be longer than the rap sheet on Jesse James.

On top of all these problems, I must note that the gas mileage seems very poor (even for an SUV).  While it only has a V-6, it regularly gets only 16-17 mpg (mostly highway).  As well, it burns some oil in between the changes (changed every 3000 miles).  Maybe I am just spoiled because my Toyota Celica hasn't had any problems, but I expect better out of a vehicle that is less than 10 years old and only has 107,000 miles on it.

I could not recommend this car to anyone.  If you have the kind of money it costs to buy a new Grand Cherokee, do yourself a favor and find another vehicle.
