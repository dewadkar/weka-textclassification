            In purchasing an M5 I had read many reviews and being a cynical ex-race driver from the uk, believed only that by driving one day in and day out would the real truth come out. 

And the truth is this is one of the most astounding sport sedans ever built. I am the proudest of all. 

In all my driving experience I have never experienced a luxury saloon car which has more poise and balance than the M5. It has an uncanny ability to soak up bumps like a 7 series and at the same time corner like a racing saloon while producing magnificent g-force in corners. 

It has absurd acceleration through its power plant and you can chuck it around til the cows come home. Demand the impossible and it will deliver without breaking a sweat, however all of this must be done with the DSC off and the sport button activated for faster throttle responsive and heavier steering. Corners appear faster than most peoples brains can compute distance over time! It just doesn't stop pulling in any gear from any rpm.

The M5's stopping power is brilliant through its 345mm 4 pot caliper front and 328mm back brakes. However for track driving they tend to suffer from brake fade when the car is being hammered continously for more than 30 mins. (and I mean hammered!)

The gearbox is a perfect compliment to the V8 engine and heavier stance of the vehicle, gear changes are smooth and slick and have a meaty feel to them. I have read reviews that criticize the pedal arrangement of the vehicle, however I find it to be excellent for heeling and toeing, and driver feedback through both pedals and steering is excellent. The DSC is far too sensitive and for the confident driver this should be turned off for maximum driver enjoyment. 

However there are flaws. And these are what readers will be looking for. The car is a big oil consumer, mine has had an unhealthy liking for oil (1.5 litres per 1000kms) this has proven to be as a result of faulty oil rings. BMW are now offering to rebuild my engine free of charge. Unsuspecting drivers may also at some point down the road get hit by ECU problems related to the Vanos system, which will leave their car powerless. I have also heard of malfunctioning dual oil pumps filling up the engine head with oil. But if buying used then check for excess black residue on the exhaust and residue on the rear skirt.

There is no spare wheel and this is quite disconcerting when you do actually get a flat. I suggest carrying a spare at the expense of losing your boot space. The roadside assistance program will cost you 3-4 hours in lost time.

Overall this is a car that is designed for the mature driver who can drop the kids at school in comfort and then tail slide through 65 mph bends in third gear with ease.  

This is a glorious car and I'm going to drive mine now!
