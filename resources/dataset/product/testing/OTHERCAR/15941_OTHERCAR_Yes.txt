            The Epson PhotoPC 600 is a great camera for someone who may be just starting out with Digital Photography.  The camera's megapixel capacity lends towards getting sharp pictures with it without a lot of work on the users end, not to mention won't leave you disappointed with the quality of the photo as some of the earlier digital cameras were apt to do.

For someone just starting out, or someone who is not familiar with how digital camera's work, this camera is simple enough to use that you can basically just point and click.  The LCD viewfinder in the back shows you exactly what you are getting picture wise, and you can erase any pictures you don't want on the spot.  Once a user gets the hang of how the camera works, they can start using some of the advanced features such as selecting the 'quality' of photo's being taken.

The only thing I find slightly annoying about the camera is that when you do press the button to take a picture, there is a pause of about a second while the camera focus' and then takes the picture.  This is one thing that one will have to get used to but once you are aware of it, it's not too bad.

The camera also, being one of their older models, and no longer one of their 'flagship' models, can be obtained at a very affordable price.  I have seen them advertised as low as $260 now.

One final thing that is nice about this camera, and the Epson line in general is that, if you don't want to tie up your computer, it can be plugged directly into one of Epson's photo quality printers via an interface bought separately and print right to the printer.  I have this camera and an Epson Photo 700 printer and the quality of the prints is superb. On the right paper, I have printed and framed photo's that people had to look at very hard to see that it was NOT a Film based photo.

Below I will list some of the pro's and con's of this camera so that you can make a decision whether it is right for you or not.


Pro's

Very easy to use, you can basically point and click.
You can see immediately what your picture will look like without having to     wait until it is downloaded.
Can be Hooked up directly to a printer.
Pictures can be saved in multiple formats, ie .jpg, .bmp for those who may not want just .jpg's and may have a need to work on photos before they are compressed.
Batteries and memory cards can be swapped very quickly when needed.
Comes with rechargeable batteries.
Is priced very cheaply now, so that you don't have to dump a ton of cash to find out later, that you don't like digital camera's


Con's

It takes a few seconds to 'store' the data of a picture just taken so you have to wait before you can take another picture.
There is a slight delay from when you push the button and the picture actually is shot.
The camera can eat batteries fairly quickly especially when using the flash.
The interface with a computer is a serial interface, so downloading a bunch of pictures can take some time, especially when each picture generally is about 2.3 meg of data in .bmp format.
Limited to only about 8 Hi Resolution pictures with it's installed memory, before you have to unload them, or purchace an additional memory card.



In closing I have to say that, no matter which camera one chooses, nobody is perfect, and sooner or later you will blow a shot.  With this in mind, it is a MUST that one has a high quality photo editing program as well. If you are going to take the plunge into Digital Photography, do it right and get a good Photo editing program. I use PaintShop Pro myself, and have saved more than one photo that was less than perfect from having to be deleted.

Which camera you choose and which Photo Editor you choose is entirely up to you, but it is of extreme importance that you have both if you want to fully enjoy the possibilities of digital photography.<br><br>
