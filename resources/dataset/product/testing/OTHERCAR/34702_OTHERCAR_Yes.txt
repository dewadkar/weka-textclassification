                When my wife's last car (a geo meteo) died at the end of 1998 we went looking for a new car.  We went to several car dealers and test-drove a lot of vehicles.  When we came to the Hyundai Sonata I was, at first not impressed.  I had a friend that had a Hyundai a few years back and can remember being very cramped and uncomfortable, not to mention unsafe!

     As this was going to be my wife's car I let her make up her own mind, after all her last car was a Geo Metro (no comment).  She drove first and my first impression of the car was pretty good.  The doors were solid and the car felt comfortable.  She drove around the block a couple of times and told me she liked it.  After looking at cars all day I was partly glad.  Then it was my turn.  I got in and started it up.  It did not sound like a car I would drive but for a 2.4 liter 4 cylinder it had some pick up to it.  The instruments were all laid out nicely and the front was very roomy.  The brakes worked very well and the handling was very nice.  After the road trip I checked out the back seat and found that I could squeeze in but would be uncomfortable on a long trip.  This was not much of a problem as we were only going to have the kids in the back (at that time they were 2 and 4 years old).  The back seats hold both childrens car seats with enough separation between to two to hold an average size cooler between the two.

     Getting back to the dealer I checked the rest of the car out.  Opening the back was amazing!  The trunk was huge!  I was no longer unimpressed by this car.  The purchase went very smoothly and we drove it off the lot.  We got the extended warranty on the car before leaving which was the 10 year 100,000 mile powertrain and the five year 60,000 limited warranty.

    In the past year we have had very few problems with the car.  We had the brakes redone when they started to squeak and have had the clock and the windows fixed.  The brakes were just worn out, no big deal there.  The clock was covered under warranty and replaced and the window cost us $100 under the limited warranty.  So far I have been very impressed with the reliability of this car and will probably expect when this one goes we will buy another.
