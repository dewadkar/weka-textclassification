            My husband and I bought this vehicle primarily for his commute to work.  Our S-10 is a 4 cyl.  and the gas mileage is unbelievable for a truck!  We have (so far) had only one minor problem with an extremely squeaky seat, but the dealership was so helpful and apologetic that it was replaced right away no questions asked.  We are thrilled with them and the truck!

Our s-10 drives like a car.  It isn't the hard to park, bumpy riding, gas guzzler that I had feared.  It just goes to show that technology is really moving along and chevrolet ranks right up there with the best of them.

Seating capacity is very limited and I could not recommend this for a family vehicle, but for anyone who has a long drive back and forth to work or school, this is the truck for you!<br><br>
