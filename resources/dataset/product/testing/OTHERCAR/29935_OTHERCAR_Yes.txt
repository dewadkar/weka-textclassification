            I paid $400 for this camera. Was it worth it?

I think so. I've certainly enjoyed owning it, and
have been quite pleased with its' performance so far.

A digital camera is becoming alot like a computer...buy
one today, and it's practically obsolete in a couple of months. 
Well, the Sanyo VPC-X350 camera isn't quite obsolete yet,
 but I could have gotten more camera for the money if I'd shopped online, or
even better, had waited just a few more months, *then* shopped
online! 
(I'm just one of those people that doesn't like to wait
for things.) 

The X350 was easy to learn, which surprised me, because it looks 
like it would be complicated to use. It's not! It's somewhat like
a camcorder - there is a LCD display on the back, a nice size and
it looks good too. (I've seen cheap cameras that had a really
blurry and cheap look to the display, but not this one.) The menus
are easy to remember once you read the manual and learn everything
this camera can do. You can choose one of 3 different picture
quality settings; of course the best quality photos are larger, therefore 
you can fit less of them on the 4 meg SmartMedia card that comes 
with it. (Optional purchases are an 8 or 16 meg card so you can 
store more photos, and a floppy disk-type adapter that transfers the photos onto your computer.) The X350 plugs into your serial port, which means in my case that I
have to unplug my external modem every time I want to download pictures
from the camera, which isn't cool. It would be nice if it supported
USB, but then we're talking more money than I wanted to spend. 

I'm very happy with the photo quality. Some of my photos seem almost
in 3D, as if they're about to jump right off the computer screen. One thing I don't like is the amount of time it takes from when I press the
button to when it actually TAKES the picture. It takes about 1 1/2 seconds, and alot can happen in 1 1/2 seconds...you lose the shot!

I do like the features like locking photos so they can't be erased, adding a voice comment to a photo, and taking sequential shots (great when you have a baby!) There is even a puzzle, which uses your choice of your photos to make a slide-type puzzle.

The important specs: 850,000 pixels CCD (now they've
got &quot;mega pixel&quot; out, so here comes that obsolescence I was talking
about earlier.); 2&quot; TFT Color LCD Monitor; Video clip; Sequential shot;
SmartMedia Memory Card; Optical View Finder; Built-in Flash (3 mode); Voice Memo; Serial and audio/video out; digital zoom (camera/playback).
What this means is that you can't zoom and THEN take a photo...you can only zoom into a photo that you've already taken...not what I
THOUGHT zoom meant!) There is a slide control on the side to choose
between normal and closeup photography, as well. 

It comes with a battery charger and 2 sets of 2 nickel-cad batteries,
so there is always a set charged and ready. This shows that these people
were thinking! &lt;g&gt;

All in all, this is a pretty decent camera, but even better if you can 
pick one up for less than what I paid!
