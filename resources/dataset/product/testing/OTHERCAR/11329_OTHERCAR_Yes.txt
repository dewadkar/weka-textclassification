            After having used a Kodak DC215 with 1.3 megapixels I decided I would like to have more megapixels for larger prints and more detail in the pictures.  I reviewed many cameras on this board, settling for one of the Nikon Coolpix cameras at 2  megapixels. Then I saw this camera on sale at Target. Great price, had 3  megapixels. 

I wanted to stay with the CF card because I had the SanDisk reader already hooked up to my computer. The camera came with some outstanding software. MGI PhotoSuite IIISE. I already had this on my computer. It's a nice program but I favor Ulead Photo Express. It also came with the USB cable to connect the camera to Windows for downloading which again I don't use.

On my Kodak I could only get the date imprinted but with this one I can get the date and time.  I also like the idea that I can take 10 continuous shots, no wait time. Also short movie clips with sound. This camera also gives me 4 recorded image sizes that includes 3 choices of picture quality. Now I can image sizes from 2048 x 1536 to 512 x 384 in normal, fine or superfine. I like being given a choice in what type of picture I'm going to get.

I was also pleased that the camera came with a case. I had to buy one for the Kodak.  Also the menu is very clear, quickly changed for picture quality. You also have the choice of auto, 100, 200, & 400 for ISO quality. There is a round dail on top of the camera that you turn to select still, movie, playback, etc. mode. Very easy. Also a button that will turn the LCD screen off. There is a button on the back of the camera which brings up the menu, plus another round button that arrows to the changes, then you press the center marked OK and the change is made. That made things a lot easier for me. I'm not a patient person who cares to push too many buttons to get where I need to go.

Pictures can also be shown on the TV from the camera which is a plus since I take pictures of various buildings, barns, etc for painting, I needed detailing and the pictures from this camera do just that.  If I want to do portraiture or candid shots that's available also. Photo printouts can be as large as 11 x 14 if you need that large a print. An 8 x 10 photo is what I use when I use the photos as models for painting. 

I never used the LCD screen with the Kodak because that would eat the battery power faster than the manufacturers of the batteries could make them.  However I have had to use the viewer only on one occasion.  All the other times I've used the LCD screen and the batteries are still ready for more usage which pleases me.

It came with a 16mb CF card and 4 AA batteries plus the various connections for downloading to your computer. All in all I like the camera and the freedom it gives me to take any type of photos I want.
