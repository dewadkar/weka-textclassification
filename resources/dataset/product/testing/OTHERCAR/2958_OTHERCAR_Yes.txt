            This is a truely great SUV. I bought it in the Fall of 1998, and have loved it since. The reason I chose the Navigator was for the amount of passengers it can hold. It can hold 7-8 passengers in the three bench configuration. The only other car like that is the Dodge Durango. The Durango, is smaller, and doesn't have much leg room. The other reason I chose the Navigator is the captains chairs in the back seat. My kids are really annoying to deal with on long road trips. With the captains chairs, my kids are separated, and can sit in comfort. In the recent snow storms, the Navigator has handled better than any other car I have ever owned.<br><br>
