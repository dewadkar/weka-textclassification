            I've always had fun driving. But never so much fun as driving a New Beetle. Even now that Beetles are common, people still smile when you go by. It puts them, and you, in a good mood.

But I wouldn't be so impressed by this car if it didn't perform in an excellent way. I've got the 1.8 liter turbo motor in mine, and let me tell you this is one fast car! There is not much on the road that I can't beat at a stoplight race. My past two cars had six cylinder motors in them, and I didn't think a four could satisfy me. But this one is so quiet, so smooth, so powerful that many people who ride in my car think it's a six. 

Handling is very good, especially if you get rid of the OEM tires. I've done a couple of Driver Schools, and taken the car on a race track three times. It often keeps up with cars much more expensive and powerful than the Beetle.

Not all is rosy in VW land though. Although the car is fun, practical, and durable (no problems in 20k miles), expect poor service and parts availability problems at your local VW dealership. VW dealerships have never been very good, and increased sales recently have put an incredible strain on an already marginal network.  <br><br>
