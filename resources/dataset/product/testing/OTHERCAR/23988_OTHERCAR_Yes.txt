            I'm 22 years old, and I know that Grand Marquis are typically &quot;grandpa-mobiles&quot; (ever my Grandfather calls my car that), but for me it made a lot of sense.  I wanted a car with a quiet ride, a lot of features, good power, rear-wheel drive, and a purchase price I could afford.  That pretty much narrowed it down to a Grand Marquis, a Crown Victora, or a Chevy Caprice.  I figured 3 million cops and cabbies can't be wrong, so I went with the Mercury. (btw the Grand Marquis and the Crown Vic are essentially the same car).  Mine is a 93 LS and I bought it with 75,000 miles. Mine does not have the police package, which adds dual exhaust, a firmer ride, and about 20 horsepower, but gives you 2.5 less miles per gallon.  A year and a half later it has 106,000, and it's still running fine.  There have been some minor problems, but nothing unexpected.  The engine still runs smooth and the transmission still shifts crisply. 

Good points:

1.  Value - For all that you get, a used Grand Marquis is a great deal. 

2.  Room - It's a big car and there is a lot of room on the inside, and plenty of trunk space.  The rear-wheel-drive set-up makes the trunk shape somewhat odd, but you can still fit a lot of stuff.  Plus you can tow 5000 lbs.  3 adults will be comfortable in the backseat, and even 3 up front once in a while isn't all that bad.

3. Noise - Car is very quiet during normal driving.  The engine will growl a little when you punch it but it's a nice noise and it's never intrusive.  Even at 80 mph (no Mom I don't drive that fast most of the time) you can still have perfectly normal conversations.  

5. The ride is great.  It can wallow a little bit around a corner and when you brake hard, but most of the time it's compliant and soaks up bumps well.   The steering is effortless, although they make it a little firmer on the highway, which is a good thing.  Despite what people may think it does NOT handle like a boat.

4. Looks - Personally I think the car looks more expensive than it, especially from the side.  The view up front isn't too special, but people do think you're a cop once in a while if you get a white one.

5. Rear-wheel drive -  Personally I prefer the way RWD cars handle.

6. BIG back seat.  I'll just leave that one up to your imagination. ;-)
 
Not-so-good

1. Mileage: I get about 23 on the highway and 19 around town.  It's almost as good as other V6 large cars like an Avalon or a LeSabre, but it's certainly better than all V8 SUV's.

2. Body Roll: People who are very prone to motion-sickness might not like this car, especially in the back seat.

3. Rear-wheel-drive:  In the snow the car does not perform as well as a all-wheel-drive car, and you have to take it a little slower.  However, with anti-lock brakes, snow tires, traction control, and knowing what you are doing, handling in the snow is not a problem and don't let people scare you into thinking that.

I would recommend this car to anybody seeking a large sedan with good value and a lot of room.  Somebody looking for a sporty car should look elsewhere.
