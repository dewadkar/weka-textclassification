            The Kodak DC-240 is a really good digital camera.  It is one of my favorite camera's that I have ever used.  One of the things that I like about this camera is the size and shape of it.  It is also very easy to use and understand.  I dont know about you but i have used plenty of cameras that i really didnt have a clue how to use.  I think that is ome of the things that keeps me from getting a camera but once I used this camera it changed my whole perspective about digital cameras.  I really think that this camera is a great camera to own.  I think that digital cameras are taking over regular cameras now a days.  If you go into a electronics store you will be more likly to see a nice digital camera than a regular camera.  I think that more people are switching over to digital cameras as well.  Not to long ago I was on vacation and I noticed that more people seemed to have digital cameras.  That is why you should get this camera.  Why would you get a regular camera and have to get the film developed every time you use it when you can buy a digital camera and you can put the pictures on your computer.  I think that this Camera is great and that everyone should have it.<br><br>
