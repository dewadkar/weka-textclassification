            An excellent starter camera for a relatively low price.  I bought mine used from a friend.  Simple to use, great quality in well-lit areas.  I have a 32 MB card and I love than I can just change it to low res (640x480) and take hundreds of pictures before the batteries (NiMH) wear out.

From what I understand, the medium resolution should provide good enough pics for decent 4x6 prints.

I use NiMH batteries, and they last for a long time, and I take lots of pictures.  <b>Make sure you buy some rechargeable batteries, or you'll run through alkalines like crazy!</b>

The ability to click the jog dial right after taking a pic to delete it is excellent!  I wish all cameras had the option of a feature like that.  You can turn it off, to conserve battery power, if you want.

As far as shutter lag, there's a lot if you just want to press the button all the way and hope for a shot.  I found that the best technique is to hold the button down half-way, until you get the solid green light in the viewfinder (at which point it has now focused), and then hit the button the rest of the way when you're ready for the picture.  If you do that, there's practically no shudder lag, once you've gotten the button half-way pressed and want to commit to the picture.

I'm going to gripe now because I can, and maybe it will help someone.  However, I realize that many of these would be eliminated by a more expensive camera, which is what I need.  I don't expect the 215 to act like a studlier camera.  But if someone's shopping for a 215, this may give them an accurate picture for what they're in for.

I often have to retake pictures because I can't see the edges of the image well when looking through the viewfinder.  It's very hard to get a good level picture unless you turn on the battery-sapping LCD screen (which is unusable in bright overhead light situations).

There's no difference in the medium and high resolution modes!  But for some reason, high takes up much more space.

I don't like the way it can't remember settings.  Every time I turn it on, I move to the menu and turn the flash off.  

It captures images at an equivalent of ISO 100, and the aperture isn't very big.  This means that low-light photos are not very good.  I was very disappointed at this.  I was using a similar olympus, when I switched to this one and I was mystified at the horrible blotchies that appear in low-light areas.  Sunsets are my favorite things, and most of the time, this camera doesn't have what it takes to render them in any acceptable way.  Even invoking the flash indoors is often not enough.

The digital zoom (2x) is pretty much worthless.  It basically just crops the picture for you, conserving space.  If you have a card larger than 4MB, you can store the whole thing and crop it later.
