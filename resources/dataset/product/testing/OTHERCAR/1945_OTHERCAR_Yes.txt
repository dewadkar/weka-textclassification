            Q: Why did I buy this vehicle?

A: 222hp, 5 speed manual, 17"rims, 200watt Bose stereo, and looks to kill. That's what grabbed my attention about this unique class of car. Yeah, there is competition, if you don't mind an automatic transmission. 5 speed seekers however will be kicking tires at the BMW, SAAB, VOLVO dealership lots. Kicking tires is all I did considering the $10,000+ price difference, not for me.

Q: What's it like to drive this car?

A: Well, barking the front tires with a redline shift into second while pulling a full car length on that 328 was exciting! Then there is the endless search for backroad shortcuts, or is it longcuts, cruising in 3rd gear, the roof to open, smooth jazz surrounds me, just waiting to carve out of that next curve with potent throttle response and minimal body flex. Then there is that feel of silence while you drive on the highway almost set aside from the outside.

My wife thinks I am crazy. But that's what this car lets you do. You can be a little crazy and still be extremely civil and practical. The car truly has two sides and I love them both!

Here is my "picky" list:

1. The 5 speed. Although capable, I would die to swap it for my "snik- snik" '91 CRX manual shifter. It could be more refined matched to such a fantastic engine.

2. Stereo. There is no visual volume level indicator on the stereo's face. I would have to say though, that the stereo will not clip even turned up all the way. It still would be nice to see where the volume level is, and the knob turns forever.

3. Trunk. The trunk is huge. But, the hinge arms take up some space when you shut the lid, usually crushing something before you notice or remember. The car doors shut with precision and grace, the trunk lid however, like a thin tin can, I don't get it. Another thing, the remote trunk release is nice, but the trunk lid does not pop open raising the lid all the way. With an arm full of whatever, you will be lifting the lid with a finger tip or setting something down. I really didn't notice this feature until I saw it on a much less expensive car parked next to me.

4. Front seats. The seats are fine, more family car like than sport car. I realize the compromise, but I would wish for heavier side bolsters.

The auto version you say?
     Having rented an automatic 2000 Maxima for 11 days on vacation prior to my cars 5 month delivery date, I must say the two cars are very different. The 5 speed is much, much faster and the SE ride with 17" rims compared differently to the more comfortable ride of the "rental car" version (no badging was displayed). Regardless, the car pulled strongly in it's powerband and drove beautifully. Very different car though.

Update: Winter snow hit.

Well as I suspected, unlike the salesmans pitch about front wheel drive, the car struggles a bit when things get slick with ice and snow. Yes, the front drive gets around beter than lets say a rear drive Mustang GT, but it's not hard to get a little squirly off the line. The anti-lock are awesome, although it did not stop me from driving straight up onto a 4" curbed island. Yep, the whole car kept right on going. I made sure the wheels where straight and that's the best I could do. Expecting at flat tires, at least 2 bent rims and the need for a full alignment I was surprised the next day to find the same glass smooth ride right up to 70 mph on the highway. No pulling or steering wheel vibration at all. Like it never happened, DURABLE!

Update: Another bimmer left wondering.....

Leaving work last night I see the tint of clear blue headlights approaching as I merge out from the parking lot. It was dark so I could not see what make it was until we both stopped at the red light. Now I see it's as I hoped a 3 series BMW coupe. But wait "oh no" what's that on the fender and why did I not see the badge on the back of the car before I lined up so seriously. It's an M3, last generation! As his girl friend looks over at me I play like I am oblivious. The green light send him brisk off the line from a rolling start and I return with a mash of the throttle surprisingly pulling past him in a hurry! I hear his car screaming on the side of me, just waiting for the furious pass. As he peers a half car out in front of me, I need to shift into 2cd NOW, I shift fast, breaking my tires loose like never before( I swear both tires spun for 2 full seconds)once they gripped I pulled away from that M3 fast and hard and he didn't catch up until my 90 something mph redline shift into 3rd. We caught the next red light where I tried to get his attention to talk, but instead he chose to look straight ahead and show his girlfriend how to fully abuse a good clutch as he scorched brutely off the line when the light turned green, and he was gone, giving the Max the respect it demands.
