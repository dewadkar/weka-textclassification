              <b>B</b>y the mid-late 1970's, the large V8 powered Firebirds with real muscle were a pastime, but in the late 1980s Pontiac re-introduced true high performance to the Firebird with the 350 ci engine. GTA stands for, 'Grand Turismo Americano'. By bumping up the power, Pontiac created a machine that was perfect for the performance deprived early 1980s market, especially for GM fans who refused to buy the already fast Mustang GT.

<i>Performance</i>
 
                Pontiac modified the <b>suspension</b> with its WS-6 performance and handling package. This offers stiffer springs, and larger anti roll bars. The GTA understeers more, giving a reassuring and stable feel. rocketed through a slalom though, the GTA could easily stay on the heels of some 1980s Porsche's or Ferrari's. There is an abundance of raw power that can send the 1992 GTA to 60 mph in less than 7 seconds (according to specs), while its terminal velocity taps out at 150 MPH (again, according to specs). What else could power this fast Firebird but General Motors' legendary 350 ci, (5.7 liter) V8. Is uses a single camshaft, pushrods and rockers to operated 2 valves per cylinder. Although the short stroke engine could be made to rev in 1988, it had a hard time doing it, so 1992 TPI (tuned port in injection) made this task much easier. This engine sounds very aggressive at start-up, and on take-off. Even with an automatic transmission this car gives <b>acceleration</b> that can match many sports cars of the late 1990s. <b>Cruising</b> in this car is a little rough, but a true muscle car enthusiast will pay no attention. 


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

      The <b>interior</b>, while a bit dated, is very sporty, a meaty steering wheel is offered, comfortable and supportive cloth bucket seats, and good room up-front. Ergonomics are fair, everything is in reach of the driver, but I did not like the drivers position which disabled good rear vision. The rear is also very cramped, fit for children only. The Firebird has a large hatch that can carry tons of groceries, the interior was made to be very useful for cargo and front passengers, however little thought was given to the rear seat passengers. The GTA brought the spark back to the Firebird, combining comfort and excellent out-right performance. In late models, such as my '92 tester air bags were available.


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

          The <b>exterior</b>, while not 'super car' material, it is sleek and aggressive looking, especially over its lesser models. Hood louvers, good looking rims, a smooth nose design, pop up lights, and modest ground effects make this car real 'eye candy' for American muscle car enthusiasts.  

     Since these cars are collectible, its very hard to find one for a good <b>price</b>. A 1992 will run you around $10,000 or more.
        
I've only driven this car a few times, so I personally can not comment of how reliable this car is. However, according to many, this car lives up to Chevy's slogan 'solid as a rock'. Check out <b>Consumer Reports.Org</b> or talk to some owners for more info.
