            When I met Sophie (my black, sweet, Jetta temptress)two months ago, I fell in love.  I knew I wanted a sexy small car that could perform with the boys, but make the girls swoon.  The engine growls to life as I twist the key/remote in the ignition.  The feel of the leather surfaces and steering wheel remind me of an Audi A4, or BMW 3 series.  And for thousands less.  

As I slipped her into first gear and roared away from the dealership, I smiled and knew my money was well spent.  In only two months, I've driven almost five thousand miles and am impressed by the 31.4 mpg my nifty on-board computer tells me I'm getting on the highway[avg mileage since purchase = 25.5 mpg]  A 174 HP six cylinder that gets that mileage (with these gas prices)is a welcome bonus.  I've been feeding her medium grade Mobil, but will move up to premium [recommended] when prices drop some.

The Jetta GLX is available as a 5 speed manual or 4 speed adaptive automatic.  I prefer the stick - medium to short throw and oh so smooth.  Sophie is quick to 30 mph - in first gear.  Second is the lazy gear(on purpose, I think) Third gear is mighty impressive - I can jump from 50 to 70 in less than 3 seconds.  Even fourth gear performs, while setting the cruise in fifth gear is a great ride.  75 mph = about 2650 RPM.  Even large hills in the Adorondack Mountains were easily cruised in 5th gear.

My Jetta was $28,215 [with 8.25%NY tax, title and destination]and includes the extended 7 year bumper-to-bumper warranty [$1500].  The special promotion included was a CD-changer (Panasonic - 6 disc.  Sounds great with the 8 speaker Monsoon system).  I had been saving up for some time to get this beauty, so after a large down payment each month I send $263.00 to VW.  Not bad for what I got.

One thing I hated about my previous car was road noise, which I'm happy to say the Jetta does not have.  At 70 mph I can enjoy the quiet moments of Brahms 3rd Symphony, or rock out to Lenny Kravitz &quot;American Woman.&quot;  

OK.. how about coming back to reality.  Anything I don't like about Sophie?  Well, she's not perfect.  Baby doesn't have &quot;Back&quot; if you get my drift - her trunk is only 15 sq ft, but I can still fit my large suitcase, medium size bag, and two bookbags easily.  

The rear seat is a bit cramped, too.  At the dealership I tried out the rear quarters and knew I could handle a two hour trip, but not a ten hour trip [I'm 6'].  The BMW 323 has over a foot more wheelbase, but hey - you gonna pay for it.  Recently I drove three friends from NYC to Philly and back with no complaints [BTW, there are cup holders for the rear passengers].

For you performance minded guys out there you may also be a mite disappointed with the suspension.  During my breathtaking trip up the Taconic Parkway (a challenging and fun drive for all you NY area drivers) I noticed Sophie's struts were a bit smooshy, but nothing some aftermarket couldn't fix.  Plus, I'm not a race driver, so it's fine with me.

A word about gadgets [I'm a sucker for gadgets].  My car is filled with helpful things like automatic dimming rear-view mirrors, heated seats and side mirrors, rain-sensitive wipers, telescoping steering wheel, electronic key locks, sophisticated alarm, and climate control.  Climate control seams like a luxury, but like the Showtime Grill, &quot;Set it...and FORGET IT.&quot;  The temperature of the car is now one less thing my girlfriend and I argue about.

My final advice...BUY THIS CAR!  For you family types, consider the dual front and dual side airbags, rear child seat restraints, and rear sun-shade.  For you single types, consider the power sunroof, agile handling, 16&quot; alloy wheels, and the babe factor.  For people over 6'3&quot; - you're gonna be cramped here, buy a VW Bug. For large families with potentially &quot;big and tall&quot; children, Sophie probably ain't for you.  

Good luck finding your new car.  May it be a Jetta.<br><br>
