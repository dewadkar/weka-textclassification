            The Hummer H1 - revered by some, hated by others, recognizable by all.

As an actual H1 owner, I felt that it's my duty to write a review from an owner's perspective.  

Background - The 2003 AM General Hummer H1 is a civilian version of the United States Armed Forces HMMWV.  Rated as a Class III truck by the Department of Transportation, it's a vehicle that has no air bags, no padded dash, and seats only 4 people in a standard configuration.  

Nearly unchanged from the time it was introduced in 1992 for civilian use, the 2003 Hummer H1 is a very versatile vehicle for those who really want to go off-roading.

Every Hummer and HMMWV has many common parts - engine, frame, transmission/driveline, and the overall shape.  

What's different between the Hummer and the HMMWV (from a simple view) is that the HMMWV has rock hard seats, it's usually equipped with a non-turbo diesel engine, and it's electrical system is configured for 24 volts and is sealed for use in less than perfect conditions.

AM General currently handbuilds an average of 250 Civilian Hummers in a production year, and projects to build the same amount from here on out.  Current H1's can only be had in either a wagon or open-top style convertible.

Dispelling rumors, myths, and things to note:  Both the civilian and military Hummer cannot float, is not bulletproof (remember Black Hawk Down?), is not waterproof (although it can traverse through 30 inches of water for the civilian/60 inches of water for the military), and is not indestructible.

Exterior - The H1's exterior is made of a combination of aluminum and steel with a fiberglass hood.  Exterior body panels are attached together using rivets, traditional welding, and an automotive version of Super Glue.  (cyanoacrylic type adhesives).  It's overall modular structure allows for one vehicle frame to accommodate a variety of exteriors, including 2 door, 4 door, wagon, and ambulance/tour bus type bodies.  The Hummer and Humvee all share similar body components.

Interior - The H1's interior is very stark.  It's a no-frills type of configuration in which it's mostly vinyl with either leather or cloth seats.  

The seats themselves are a drastic improvement from the military version of the Hummer.  Made by Isringhausen, the H1's seats are a variant of those used by bus drivers and long-haul truckers; very comfortable and very adjustable.  The seats can adjust themselves to a wide variety of drivers with ease.  (Case in point - I'm 5' 11", my wife is 5' 0".  Both of us drive the H1 with zero problems).

Because the design of the Hummer required high ground clearance (16" in a stock Hummer), many engine and transmission components are placed inside the cab itself.  The transmission tunnel is 3 feet wide in some places, and all occupants are placed around the transmission tunnel.  

The Gauge cluster is very sparse.  You get basic readouts for speed, voltage, RPM's, engine temp, and oil pressure.  

The stock steering wheel leaves a lot to be desired.  If you have large hands, you will eventually get cramping if you grip the wheel for a long period of time.  Luckily, it's easily replaced by an aftermarket steering wheel.

The stock stereo system is wonderful - providing you turn the volume up enough to drown out the engine.  Soundproofing is very good, but you still hear far more noise in the classic GM/Detroit Diesel designed 6.5L Turbo Diesel than you do in the current Duramax/PowerStroke/Cummins offerings in other vehicles.

Using the Hummer - On Road:  I'm one of the few owners that uses their Hummer as a daily driver.  In the Phoenix area, it's very easy to pilot a vehicle that's nearly 7 feet wide.  The Hummer is actually quite nimble, allowing me to do a U-Turn into the middle lane of a three lane street.  The stock Goodyear GS-A tires are very quiet on pavement and can actually take some abuse off road as well.

Parking the Hummer is somewhat of an exercise.  Many angled stall parking lots can accommodate the H1 without much problems.  Ninety degree parking lots may require you to find a stall that you pull forward into so that you can just drive straight out to leave.

Using the Hummer - Off Road:  This is clearly where the Hummer excels, with one caveat: You need to choose trails that can accommodate your nearly 7 foot wide vehicle.

It's easily one of the best off-road vehicles out there today.  Utilizing a stock Hummer, you're able to go into places that only modified 4x4's could go.  It's 16 inches of ground clearance and undercarriage and rocker panel protection will help deter damage in most cases to the Hummer's driveline and lower body.

If you have a Hummer with true off road tires, you'll have the ability to go nearly anywhere you want to, providing you use common sense.  With the H1's Central Tire Inflation System (CTIS), you are able to inflate and deflate your tires specific to the terrain you are attempting to cross, all without leaving the cab.

Owners of other 4x4's can easily take advantage of the Hummer's capabilities without a large amount of acclimation time.  Those who have never driven a 4x4 before should take advantage of the dealership sponsored outings (all Hummer dealerships do a minimum of 4 sponsored outings a year) to get used to the Hummer's capabilities.

To help novices in off-roading, the 2003 Hummer H1 has a unique wheelspin prevention/traction control system called TorqueTrac4 (TT4).  Introduced in 1999, TT4 automatically will apply the brakes to the wheel that spins, allowing traction to take place on the wheels that aren't spinning aimlessly.  (Note:  Older Hummers can do the same thing by applying their brakes while in slippery conditions.  This technique is called Brake/Throttle Modulation, or BTM).

Contrary to popular belief - Hummers can get stuck.  Hummers can break down, and Hummers need careful watch over their maintenance.  Despite the fact that Hummers have a rated duty cycle of 10 years in constant battlefield conditions, you still need to have them looked at on the schedule that AM General provides.

Compared to the other 4x4's that I've owned, the Hummer easily outdoes nearly everything off the road with the exception of a highly modified Jeep Wrangler with a total customization job (lift kit/lockers/tires).  On rough terrain, I'm able to go on trails faster and surer compared to my Toyota Tundra 4x4 with Toyota Racing Development package.

On the road, be prepared to go no faster than 65-70mph at the max.  The engine/transmission/geared wheel hub combination doesn't really provide gearing for you to go fast on the freeway.  It's set to provide you maximum traction and torque to get you through very hostile terrain.  There is one good thing about this - you'll never get a speeding ticket on the highway!

The Hummer isn't for everyone.  There's two type of owners: One treats their Hummer as a "street queen" and never takes it off road (and revels in the looks they get), others will take theirs off road and revel in the capability the Hummer has in less then perfect conditions.

It's interior is stark for what you pay for (over $100,000 list), and it's ride is bouncy and harsh.  Many people feel cramped in the passenger spaces, and many wide shouldered people will be squashed up against the door or doorframe while riding in it.

Maintaining a Hummer can cost a bit of money, especially if you are doing a lot of off-roading.  It's very fortunate that the engine and drivetrain components are ones that you can easily obtain parts for at any NAPA, Checker/Schucks/Kragen, or Auto Zone.  Tires are available in either 16.5 or 17 inch rim sizes, and the owner can do most of the upkeep themselves if they are handy with a wrench.

It's not for everyone, but for those who want to have one of the ultimate off-road vehicles, it's the definite vehicle to have!
