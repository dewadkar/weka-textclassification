            <b>I recently purchased a 2000 Huyandi Elantra. I researched different types of cars on the internet and the Elantra looked like a model definitely worth looking at. My purchase price was right around $13,000 and I got a lot for my money! The car comes with a 5 year 60,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty standard. A tape player and cruise control came on the model I purchased and were very reasonably priced for options!

 The car is a 4 cylinder, but with a 1.8 liter engine which gives it lots of pickup for an economy car. The gas mileage is good as well. It is a very elegant looking car for such a nice price. Familes with 1 or 2 kids will enjoy this car which provides 4 doors, yet it almost has a sporty look to it too. 

First time car buyers would like this car for the price. Before buying anything less or more expensive, one should consider this car. In my opinion, it is a very safe, well built car which provides a buyer with lots of bargain for their buck!</b>      <br><br>
