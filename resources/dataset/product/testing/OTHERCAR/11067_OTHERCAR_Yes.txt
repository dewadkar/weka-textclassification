            My car-owning friends typically fall into two categories. The first are those which have see me navigate the 495 interchange in Northern Virginia during rush hour and are terrified at the thought of giving me the keys to their brand new baby. To give you an idea, take the recently released �Fast and the Furious�, cross it with �Ronin�, and add a pinch of �Gone in Sixty Seconds�  (the original H.B. Halicki version, not the more recent puffery from Jerry Bruckheimer). Then throw a dash of responsibility for the car and passengers, and fear of retribution from the local boys in blue, and you generally get the picture. Still, though, the majority of my friends want my pre-purchase advice and even my companionship during the negotiations. Even if I do not participate in the showroom shuck�in an jive�in, they still are anxious to show off their find and get my impressions, and hopefully my approval.

Fortunately for me, and any of you that hope to gain something from the information in this review, my good friend Wendy falls into the latter category. My friend, who I hold as the soul of class and style, recently traded her ailing, 1990 Miata in on a 2001 Audi TT. When she offered a test drive to me, she didn�t have to ask twice. 

The TT hung around the auto show circuit, teasing us for quite some time with Audi continually promising a near identical production version. Since a couple of years had passed since I saw my first TT in 1995, I was a touch skeptical. The TT certainly made the rounds of the auto journalists as if it had good intentions, but as Audi has tried to market sports coupes unsuccessfully in the past, I felt the apprehension bubbling on the surface. 

Since an auspicious beginning around the turn of the century, Audi has been a pioneer in racing of all sorts, and subsequently, performance technology. Shortly after the turn of the century, founder August Horsch developed rear mounted gearboxes and overhead valve engines. It is, in fact, due to technologies such as their evolving spray jet carburetion that allowed Audis to be so dominant in rally and especially hill climb challenges such as the Alpine Rally of the Austrian Automobile Club in 1911. In the 1920�s, tachometers, collapsible steering wheels, an aluminum engine and four wheel disk brakes � features that would not become commonplace in other makes (American especially) for years to come, graced some Audi cars. In the early 1980�s, the stunningly exotic, turbo powered, 5-cylinder, Quattro Sport, that in ultimate form, made 300 horsepower, emerged. This car, though was more for competition and availability was limited. Most people ended up buying the similarly styled and more street oriented Audi GT coupe. In the early 1990�s, an 80/90 based coupe arrived, heavily influenced buy Audi�s incredibly successful �aero� styling efforts of the eighties. A convertible followed. Engineering excellence was present, but styling was bland and performance tepid (as were sales). 

So, after a late nineties retreat into sensible sedans, the TT is here to help ease the burden of stodginess that surrounds the tremendous Audi engineering. My initial feelings about the cars appearance were apathetic. It looked the same, coming or going and the deconstructionist dash and Bauhaus body seem a little self-indulgent. However, Audi needed this bold car, as it wanted to get into the hotly contested coupe/convertible market and was tired of failing at it. In a fragment like this, you need something special to offer or your car will end up like Volvo�s competent but unappreciated C70 coupe and convertible. Chevrolet has power, Porsche has balance, and Chrysler has value. All wheel drive and German quality keep you loyal, but may not draw you enough attention to pull people off the street.  So what about styling?    

Audi hit it big in 1983 with their stunning, aerodynamic achievement, the 5000. Then, the company hit a brick wall as it struggled with fictitious legal problems. Then in the early nineties, Audi made a comeback on the show circuit with the striking, chrome Avus sports car. A bunch of rich idiots even got into a powerful bidding war for the 1000-horsepower supercar. I think the high offer was around $7 million. So with this, Audi, as a stylistic leader, returned � sort of.

One important detail to remember; the TT does not photograph well. Thusly, if you do not like the way it looks, wait until you see one on the street before passing final judgment. If you already love it, you are going to be blown away in person. Some of the harshness of early prototypes has been subdued. The interior is less spartan, the wheels less gothic, and fussy body details have been omitted. The bilateral design, width wise as well as lengthwise, is powerfully unique and cohesive. By this, I mean that every last design decision seems to fall in line with a palatable design concept. From some angles, it hurts to look at it just enough to keep you wanting to see what it looks like from other angles. Designers call this non-passive, or involving design work. 

I approve of this sort of stylistic approach only if it is respectful to the buying public. The last thing that anyone wants is for people to walk away scratching their heads and feeling as if they missed the point. A product should not make you feel stupid. Audi certainly does not want another Chrysler Airflow disaster either since few really know just how close they came in the early nineties, to packing their bags and heading back across the pond with Sterling and Alfa Romeo. 

The TT looks tighter in coupe form. Sloping �C� pillars make the car look fast even at a standstill. The top on the roadster is very squared off and sits atop the body unharmoniously. The upside-down bathtub look is less obvious with the hardtop. Rims and headlamps are gorgeous, in typical Audi form, and the retractable high-pressure headlamp washers are worth trying out in the driveway just to see them in action. Fat, twin exhaust pipes (with the more powerful version), wide Bridgestone Potenzas, and an aggressive stance make the TT look serious about performance. The rear wind deflector is nice, but the rollover bars, while conceptually suitable, are a bit of an eyesore and unprofitable focal point. The TT�s color palette is marvelously stocked with vibrancy from luscious Amulet Red to shimmering Denim Blue Pearl. Wendy chose hers in Lake Silver Metallic, always a good color on an Audi. The only shade I disapprove of is known as Nimbus Grey Pearl. This dingy slate hue looks more like something that another color becomes when it fades. My warning is simple. I fear this (seemingly popular shade) to be too trendy and will look dated in three to four years. Just a young professional designers warning. On that note, I have but two stylistic qualms to report. The first is the subtle �duck tail� spoiler that is unnecessary and out of place. Secondly, I have trouble with the articulated fender flares, joined by equally pronounced rocker and bumper fascia treatment. The look reminds me a bit too much of the overly dramatic 1968 Oldsmobile Toronado. I am getting more comfortable with it, though.

Inside, the TT seems a little overwrought with simplicity. Yes, that is what I said. However, it constantly gives you something to think about. The center, dash top vents and upper dash vents are joined in a delicious collumnier form that pierces the top of the dash. Classy, stainless looking elements abound in the structural members, steering wheel, vents, and gearshift. The TT I sampled contained a rather simple, all black, leather interior. The upholstery, as did everything I touched, felt very high quality. The TT offers a snappy, optional leather upholstery (called �Amber Red baseball optic�) with exaggerated stitching. I call it the �catchers mitt� option. Either way, the TT looks great inside. Storage is a bit limited in this two-seater, but more than ample head, shoulder, and legroom were available for my six foot-two, 175-pound body. While we are discussing the footwell area, Audi provides a very generous and comfortable dead pedal for when you are cruising, not double clutching. It is nice, but was not used once during my drive.

The 225-watt, Bose sound system will blow you away with crystal clear sound quality. Magic Carpet Ride never sounded so cool. Virginia is a bit too muggy right now for me to try out the heated seats, but as the TT doubles duty as an all wheel drive, foul weather fighter, you will likely see their value in about four months. Global positioning is available and though I could not sample it on this car, I have read that Audi still has some bugs to work in terms of usability, so you may want to abstain. The optional power operated top is not necessary, given such a tight interior. However, if it was missing on a $40,000 car, I am sure I would be complaining, so just know that it works swiftly and quietly. The standard manual unit also functions with ease, using one simple release lever above the rear view mirror. So nice are the tops that I even wondered if they were perhaps a Karman design. 

Audi offers, in the TT, a standard, 180 horsepower, 1.8 liter, turbo engine. I have sampled this four-cylinder plant in other Audi and Volkswagen vehicles and have never been disappointed. Power is smooth coming on and pulls relentlessly. Matted to a five speed, manual transaxle and front wheel drive, the standard TT will hustle you to 60 in a very respectable 7.2 seconds. Torque steer is apparently noticeable when you romp on the gas, but a heavy hand and keen performance mind will keep this in check as you nock boots with Miatas and MR2s.

Wendy, bless her, opted for the Quattro model (also offered with the 180 hp plant) and the upgraded 1.8 Turbo engine with 225 horsepower (whipping out the calculators, that translates to an impressive 126.3 horsepower per liter). The motor has 20 valves just like its less powerful sister, but takes advantage of a larger turbo unit with twin intercoolers, high performance pistons, high flow dual exhaust, and a performance, engine management computer. The hi-po TT is quite awesome. 0-60 drops down a little closer to Boxster territory at 6.2 seconds. Standing quarter disappears in 14.6 seconds at 93 miles per hour, and the TT seizes .90 on the skidpad. According to Audi, the TT tops out at 143 miles per hour.

The TT pulls beautifully and shifts like a champ with its glorious six-speed, fully synchronized manual (even reverse). I went easy on the TT as it was in its break-in period, but still tried to test its reflexes. As a sports roadster, I was impressed. It was decidedly quick and agile with a lusty engine/exhaust tone that dispensed with the whiney caterwauling of some turbo cars. As an Audi though, I had mixed feelings. The turbo suffered from a big lag problem that allowed a horrendous lurch in acceleration to occur between two and three thousand rpm�s. Despite a very flat torque curve from 2200-5500, I somehow walked away feeling that the TT got a little tired at the end of each shift � and I was letting off a football field before the redline, and well within the peak torque range. I have felt this before in the turbo A4, S4 (1995), and 200, but here it felt the most ragged. However, for a hot-rod roadster, this attitude, I find acceptable, and even entertaining. ABS assisted braking was a bit more in line with what I was expecting. Audi�s ABS is a real charmer, featuring differential lock and brake pressure regulation.  60-0 slams to a close in a scant 114 feet.
 
Audi�s familiar Quattro, all wheel drive system is marvelous as usual, offering one of the most sure footed and planted feels around. Also, as all four wheels are working together, the TT is not as easily upset by dramatic power changes as some of its competitors. The 17-inch Bridgestone Potenzas felt marvelously sticky and comfortable at the same time. The rather complex, fully independent suspension, utilizing directly coupled stabilizer bars, tracks around corners as if on rails and feels fully active (no portion feels like it is just being drug around). Australian car magazine �Motor� found that at its outer most limits, the TT�s soggy nose will leave the handling a bit tricky. I could not test the top end of this car so I will have to take their word. Suspension tuning is, though, 10 percent softer in the convertible than in the coupe. When talking performance, I prefer the structural integrity of coupes to convertibles; perhaps Audi feels the same way.

 My only complaint in the driveline arena is the same as with all Audis. In order to go fast, you must suffer the baggage of 300- 400 pounds worth of Quattro. The TT should, in my opinion, be a lighter, rear-drive car. Audi claims Quattro to be their signature technology, like the RX7�s rotary engine, or the Fairlane Skyliner�s retractable hardtop, and honestly, they do it well. Truthfully, though, Audi simply does not have a rear drive platform to offer us and where the S4, S8, and TT are concerned, it hurts them. I appreciate Audi making high performance driving a little easier, but I do not mind watching my own tail in the corners and am tired of the poor front/rear weight distribution associated with Quattro hardware. Because of the all wheel drive TT�s 3473-pound curb weight, each of the cars 225 horses has to tow around 14.9 pounds, which is more than its direct competitors.

Structural integrity surprised me a bit. The TT rides atop a VW Golf/Audi A3 platform, which may be slightly overwhelmed by the added torque and drop top nature. To this architecture, Audi applied structural rollover bars, rocker sill bracing, reinforced A and B pillars (where they meet the floor), strut tower bracing, and the use of an under dash structural member. It sounded better on paper than in practice, though. As this was a higher dollar car and a German one at that, I was expecting the granite sophistication of a 3 Series BMW convertible. Unfortunately, though, cowl shake was noticeable, as was body flex around the doors. This is, admittedly, the first Audi ragtop I have driven, and I expected some compromises. However, I have felt similar integrity from the Chrysler Sebring and Toyota Solara convertibles. Still, on relatively smooth road, the TT will feel civil with the top down, and very quiet with the top up.      

The TT, (which stands for �Tourist Trophy�, the oldest British motor sports event held on public roads) has a battle ahead of it, from inside and out. Volkswagen AG�s upper management who insist on suffocating the upscale brand with ridiculously high content, VW�s is consistently terrorizing Audi. As if Passats and Jettas weren�t treading all over the A4, if the turbo New Beetle gets the proposed drop top bodystyle and Syncro all wheel drive, it could run the slightly pricier TT out of business. Even murky General Motors knows that you do not market sister products like this, nor do you foster agon work environments amongst your subsidiary brands. On the street, the TT�s $33-$40,000 price tag is serving it well for now, by offering all of the goodness of Audi hardware and even a well designed personality, for comparatively little cash. However, at this price, the TT finds itself in very distinguished company. Forty large also nets you a Honda S2000, BMW M Roadster, or Porsche Boxster. Or, you could always buy his and hers, stripped down MR2 roadsters. Prefer the coupe like I do? Then you will also be confronted with the new Acura RSX, Volvo C70, and the benevolent BMW 330i. All of these cars are quite impressive and worth your buying consideration as well. 

They are also, arguably better performers than the hefty TT on the street or strip. But the fruitful TT offers more genuine torque than a frantic S2000, better suspension work than the M, and more pizzazz than the decaf C70. Plus, the TT comes to market with all wheel drive and about the most creative look around. Plus, though I view Quattro as a mixed blessing, you may not as your TT flies down February back roads while waving to helplessly snowbound Boxsters.

Therefore, in summary, I recommend the TT despite some new model production issues such as turbo gremlins and structural quivers. The TT goes out on the edge to be unique and does the task well. So well, in fact that future Audi�s are going to move even further down the TT styling vein. In addition, despite a bit of platform thievery, the TT feels as if it functions as autonomously as any car I have ever seen. Do you see a Golf here? Moreover, included in this meager asking price, (aside from turbo power and all wheel drive) are head/thorax airbags that protect the body and mind and stability control systems to keep you tight on the road. Finally, quality is perceptively high and the TT will likely prove as reliable as Audis have traditionally been. Out in the market place, coupe or convertible, you the buyer will have quite a bit to consider. Now that so many cars are really well done (couldn�t be said ten years ago) and are hovering around every price point, the manufacturers are not making it any easier. But, if solid German engineering and reliability, one of the most unique designs currently being produced, all wheel drive, advanced safety features, and fun personality appeals to you, then an Audi dealer would definitely be a good place to start. Any takers?
