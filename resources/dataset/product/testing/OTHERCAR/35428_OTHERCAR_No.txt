            Okay, if you are a single person that lives in the city, never plans on having kids or friends taller than 6'2", likes haughty status symbols, and doesn't mind paying about 4K more than this car is actually worth, get this car.

<b>TEST DRIVE</b>
This car is a blast to drive.  It handels so smooth that you could close your eyes and actually believe you are driving a <b>real</b> BMW.  I pumped the gas pedal and screamed onto an on ramp at about 70mph (15 over the posted curve limit) and the body did not roll at all.  This little car loves to hug the road.  I found the 6-speed gear shift a little tricky at first (you have to hang in 2nd and 3rd gear longer than expected to get the full power), but I quickly got used to it.

<b>EXTERIOR</b>
As fun as this car is to drive, it is even more fun to look at.  Sure, its a little cutesy, but who cares?  It's a heck of a lot better looking than the VW Bug.  And when they say panoramic sunroof, take them at their word; the dual glass panes really help to open up this tiny car. <b>Note:</b> Get the hood stripes!  

<b>INTERIOR</b>
Well...the layout is nice, and the seats are great, but they used plastic for the dashboard and door molding!  Not nice, rubbery plastic, but the same crud you would expect to see Power Wheels built out of.  The dealer told me that they selected this material to keep the body weight and total vehicle cost down, but I don't buy it.  Wait until a few after-market interior kits become available and then get this car.

Also, all of the buttons are in the center of the dash.  I thought this was a great feature, but some may not like this set-up when reaching to roll down the windows.

<b>ENGINE</b>
Just one note here:  Anyone who thinks that by buying a Mini they are getting a German built engine can forget it.  Although all the parts are BMW, the block is pure <b><i>Chrysler</i></b>.  Just thought you should know...

<b>Note:</b> I have taken a little flak on this comment, even though the information about the topic is widely available.  Here is a direct quote:

<i>"The standard 1.6-litre, inline four-cylinder Chrysler engine has been bored out to 1.8-litres. BMW also saw fit to bolt on a supercharger and throw in an intercooler, because forced induction can increase power, without creating increased emissions..."</i>

<b>SAFETY</b>
It has airbags all over the place!  I think there was even one for the cupholder.  One problem though;  how well will an airbag resist the bumper of a Ford Excursion as it smashes through your windshield?  The car is so small that I felt a bit timid merging on the highway and would not be surprised if the Cooper was flattened in a high-speed accident.
