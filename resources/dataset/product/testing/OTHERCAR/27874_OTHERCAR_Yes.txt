            I just recently had my car broken into and was in need of a rental car.  My insurance company hooked me up pretty well. When I arrived at rental agency I was given a Toyota Corolla 2002.

<B>Car Design</B> 

The design of this car is fairly basic and isn't flashy in the least.  It almost looks like the older Honda Civics.  The doors seem to be thin and when you close (or slam) the door, you hear the "tin" type sound the door makes. Normally, when you slam a car door shut, it makes a "thump" sound.  In this case it was like kicking a piece of tin. It just sounded thin.
 
<B>The Engine</B> 

The first thing I noticed when I started the car was it's quiet engine and how nicely it started up. I had to travel through NY STATE during the time I rented this car so it game me a good test to see if I would actually think of buying this car over my outdated car.

This car picks up when the accelerator is pressed.  Grant it, the car isn't as 'zippy' as a NEON but the engine is quicker and stronger.

Entering the entrance to the Interstate 90, I floored it. I wanted to test the build up.  I was able to hit sixty five MPH in no time at all.  The automatic transmission does it's job very well.  All this, and I can hardly hear the engine!  Overall, the engine is rock solid.

<B>Fuel Economy</B> 

I felt that the Corolla helped my wallet.  Filled this Corolla up several times and seeing that I did a bit of traveling in the time I had this car, I was able to get (roughly) 365 Miles out of a full tank!  About 45 miles more than my current vehicle situation. That is impressive!
 
<B>Road Noise</B> 
 
One of the first things I look for in a car, be it a rental or what not is the "Road Noise".  I currently drive a Neon and I absolutely cannot stand the road noise.  So, with this new 2002 car, I figured it would be very quiet. After all, I can hardly hear the engine, road noise should be less than none.

Wrong!  I found this car to be fairly noisy. But don't let that turn you away from this car just on that fact.  It could be just me but I felt it was very loud when driving 70+ MPH on the Interstate.
 
<B>Radio/CD/Tape</B> 
 
I was kind of bummed a bit to find that this car came with a sub-par radio. It had only a tape deck and not even a "seek" function on it.  OK, I <I>may</I> sound picky now but let's take a look at a few things.  

1) It's year 2002, which happens to be the make of the car.
2) Do more people have CD's or TAPES?

I felt that this was a bogus effort to cut costs down the line.  Just give the consumer a good radio with at LEAST a 'seek' function so you don't have to keep one hand on the radio all the time.  I have no tapes, only CD's so I was stuck listening to talk radio I had to search for without a 'seek' control.
 
<B>Handling and Seat Comfort</B> 
 
This car handles very well. I had no issues or complaints. However, I wasn't used to the "loose" steering that luxury cars have. Loose, I mean you can literally turn your steering wheel left and right about 2-3 inches and the wheels do not move.  In my NEON, if you pulled that trick, you would be in the other lane.

But, overall, I loved the steering wheel and when you hit bumps, you hardly felt it. This is a tribute to the suspension and shocks.  In many cars, hitting a large bump/hole in the road makes a large bang.  In the Corolla, you ask yourself..."was that a bump I hit?"  very nice!

I was always very comfortable driving this car. Seats are perfect and adjust nicely for the small guy I am (5 foot 5).  Also, I have a friend who is 6 foot 7 and rode in the car with me to a few hockey games.  He had no issues sitting in the car and adjusting the seats.
 
<B>Price</B>:
 
Well, I never bought one, but I understand that this car is roughly $12,500 give or take whatever location and taxes you have.  I think this is an EXCELLENT choice for a car for that price.
