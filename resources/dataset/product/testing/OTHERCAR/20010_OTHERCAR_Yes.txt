            My experience with the Lexus ES300 is nothing but positive. When you enter the car, the aura of luxury is the first thing that hits you. It is beautifully appointed and the placement of everything has been well planned.  

The next thing that strikes you is the absolute quietness on the road.  You are in your own little luxurious world when driving down the highway in this sweet ride.  Though it is not a sports car per se, it does have a sporty side to it. 

Given a choice between a Lexus ES300 and a top-of-the-line Camry, I would have to shell out a few more dollars and go for the Lexus.  Not only is it a better car, but the maintenance service that you receive from the dealership is impeccable.  <br><br>
