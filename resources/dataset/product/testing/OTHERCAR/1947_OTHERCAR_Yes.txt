            The engine in this car is what makes it stand out from the crowd.  With a 0-60 time under 7 seconds, it's in the realm of sports cars, with the advantage of four doors.  The engine is strong and pulls all the way to the red line (6600 RPM).  The best thing is that all Maximas get this engine - there is no watered down version available.  The four speed automatic is smooth, and quick to downshift for passing.  I purchased the GXE with the comfort &amp; convenience package (definitely worth the $$), which includes the upgraded stereo and 16&quot; tires and wheels.  The only negative about the car is the old solid axle type rear suspension, which has a tendency to be jittery and bouncy on rough roads.  For cars in this price range, this is a problem that shouldn't exist.  Cosmetically, the car is near perfect - no bad design touches or inconveniences, near perfect assembly.  As for the interior, well thought out and designed, with an 8-way adjustable power driver's seat that allows almost anyone to get comfortable.  All the gauges are easy to read, and switches are easy to find and use.  On the downside, however, the ignition is in an awkward position (the steering wheel blocks it somewhat), there is no oil pressure or battery gauge (not necesssary, but helpful if there's a problem) and the clock being separate from the radio keeps confusing everybody who gets in my car.  All in all, if you're looking for the best performing car in the mid $20k range, this is the car to have.<br><br>
