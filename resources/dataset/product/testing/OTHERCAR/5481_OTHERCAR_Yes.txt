            I was driving a trusty little Mercury when I decided it was time to upgrade.  After much comparing prices, safety issues, room, extras, and other details, I decided on a brand new Chevy Prism.  

I did so much research picking out the perfect car.  I had a baby after all and wanted to make sure that he was riding the safest possibly available.  I got the car.... A 1999 Chevrolet Prism... White exterior... Gray interior... AC, automatic, duel airbags,safety issues beyond immagination, 4 doors, WONDERFUL!  Talk about a dream come true.  The car was delivered to my house the night before my 18th birthday.  I immediately took it out for a spin with my new baby and husband.  So quiet!  The night of December 28th was wonderful.

December 30, 1998... It is time to go back to California from New Mexico.  We have to drive of course considering I have this great new car and all.  After a while of driving, I become tired and trade the driving off.  Dozing in and out while riding through the mountains, I wake up just in time to see 5 deer running out in the road in front of us.  There was no time to stop.  We hit these poor deer with my brand new beautiful car.  No one other than the animals were hurt.  When the highway patrol showed up, they said that we all should have been on the way to the emergency room because an accident like that should have had us all seriously injured.  We were fine.  My car was pretty banged up, but we were all ok.

A five hundred dollar deductable later, my 1999 Chevy Prism looked like the brand new car it was again.  That has been the only trip to the shop and it definately wasn't the car's fault!!!  

This is just the beginning of the tale of this marvelous vehicle.  It has been one wonderful thing after another.  I will honestly never drive anything other than a Chevrolet again.
