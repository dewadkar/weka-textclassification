            When deciding to replace my previous car, I seriously considered a BMW 3-series, Volvo S40, and an Infiniti I30.  I made the right choice. Especially when buying a new car, it's important to do research and comparisons.

So I was at the dealership and had done extensive research on the '97 I30 (because they had one listed on their website).    

The I30 is staggaring in it's luxury appointments and feel. My I30 is black with black leather interior, power moonroof, Bose systesm (which they all have), ABS (which they all have), the HomeLink system, cd and tape and much more. The car drives "like butta" and has as much pep to the engine as many V8's I've driven yet the gas mileage is outstanding!! I LOVE the HomeLink system which allows me to press a button and it opens the gates at my complex, the Bose system is MORE than outstanding, the auto temp control, the plush leather seats, and the moonroof, and I could go on and on.  Mine even came with a built in Infiniti car phone!

Compared to BMW and Volvo and other similar cars, one gets a WHOLE lot more for the buck with an Infiniti than one gets in those "other" cars.

This is not a car for old fuddy duddies looking to drive a Cadillac, this is a 4-door luxury sports sedan in my opinion.  This is a car for drivin enthusiasts who want the feel of a sports car and the ambiance of a luxury automobile.
