            I recently bought my first new car all on my own when I traded in my Ford Probe (check out my review for the Probe) on a brand spankin' new 2000 Chevrolet Cavalier Z-24. Well, what can I say? I think impressed and in sheer shock from it's abilities would about sum it up!
First, I will point out the bad side to this car, which is non-existent to me now. It is by no means a car to be had by the average &quot;nuclear family&quot;. It is small, lightweight, and hard to get into the back. It also sports a very high trunk line, or so it seems to me. It takes a little getting used to when you look out the back, but after a while, it grows on you very nicely! One more, which isn't a problem for me anymore, is the fact that it has a hydraulic clutch rather than the cable-operated I'm used to. Chicken feed compared to its pros!
First off, the 2.4L DOHC 4 cylinder is not the quiet little 4 cyl that the base models have. Rather, it is just the opposite! It's rev-happy and screams &quot;power&quot; in every sense of the word. The new shifter and its throw also give you the feel of much more expensive sports coupes. Couple that to the new smooth-shifting Italian designed and built transmission, and you have a small powerhouse in itself. 
It is also very comfortable to sit in while driving. I'm 6' and have no trouble with leg room when I get worked in. (a little awkward at first sit) The instrument panel is cleanly designed, and all controls, which require very little effort to operate, are within super-easy reach. Mega points for the console-mounted power window switch, a Cavalier trademark. The only gripe I have about the interior is in the instrument cluster, which could use an oil pressure gauge and voltmeter. The vision is very good, but could be better with a skinnier C-Pillar profile. 
But what really makes this car a champ is the ride! Oh, just the thought of it is a quarter of the heaven you get from driving it! With its new Level II suspension, it handles very well in the corners and is very nice over slightly rough roads as well. In fact, I would dare to say it handles as nice as my Probe did, and it doesn't even have four-wheel independent suspension! WOW! 
It may be just the appeal of the newness, (I've only put about 1100 miles on it so far and have had it about a month) but this is the best car I've ever had the honor of owning. It's an excellent deal for what you get, and you can't help but smile from gear to gear! I'm a discriminating person when it comes to cars, but so far, I have found nothing to knock this car about! But above all, if you take anything from this, remember this: Cavalier Z-24-Sporty, quick, handles like a dream and comfortable. Best deal for the money. I think it's safe to say that &quot;Speedo&quot; will be sticking around until long into my child's life, so they can get the same feeling I get every time I set foot onto those pedals...<br><br>
