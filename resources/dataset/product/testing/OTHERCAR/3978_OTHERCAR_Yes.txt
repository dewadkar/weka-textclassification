            I have been a Saturn owner since 1995. I began with a Saturn SL2 and this year I have upgraded to the LS, the big sedan. I am growing up and was ready for a more substantial automobile. In the Saturn tradition the purchase was a &quot;no brainer&quot;, investigate the options, decide what your want, and order. There is none of the haggling or games seen with other dealers.

The car(silver plum exterior/black interior)is roomy with comfortable seats and more refined dash details than the smaller cars. The sound system is great. The doors close with the &quot;woosh&quot; of a small safe. Remember it is a $18K sticker, it is not porsche. The steering is tight and responsive similar to better european models. The engine is quiet and the six cylinder engine provides power small car owners dream about. The trunk is large and with Saturn's fold down rear seat it provides small furniture moving capability. It is a excellent road/touring car. It is a fine family car or simply a car for for grown ups.  Buy it and see.
