            I love my Jeep because it handles so well.  We  have had our Jeep since October of 1994.    We are not the least  bit  sorry for purchasing this Jeep.    When  we  go out,   we  feel safe driving the Jeep.  

  The abs brakes are a real addition for stopping and control power.     You have plenty of room for cargo.  That  seems to be  no problem for us.  We live out in the country.  When we  have bad weather, you can bet our mighty Jeep give us no problem.   

 The only thing which could be a little bigger is the back seat.    We could use more leg room.   But , all in all, this is the best  sport utility going to us.    This is a great vehicle for families or people who live in rural areas or hills.

  I have taken it on camping trips and to the  grocery  store for weekly shopping.    Our Jeep has  plenty of room to haul whatever  we  need. Also,  our Jeep dealer has been plenty helpful.     The service in the garage takes care of  us  whatever the problem.   Any  problems,  Chrysler answered anything we needed.  

 Thumbs up on Jeep!<br><br>
