            When my husband needed another car two years ago, we went to the dealer to look at used Lincolns.  We were very fortunate to find a 1995 Lincoln Town Car with just over 20,000 miles.  This car was in mint condition with not a nick or dent anywhere on the body.  The interior was spotless and looked like it had never been driven.  We asked who had been driving it and the salesman told us it had been leased by a major company that supplies all their executives with Lincoln Town Cars.  That explained the low mileage.  The driver more than likely had his/her own luxury car/cars that were used for family trips, etc.  This car had probably only been used to drive to work and had its own parking space (hence the lack of nicks on the doors.)  This is something to look for when buying a used car--check on availability of this type of leased car.

We test drove the car and were immediately sold. We drove some of the newer models and didn't find them to have as comfortable a ride as the 95.  I guess it's the length of the model.  It glides along the road and you don't feel the bumps.  We bought the car!

We have found the Lincoln Town Car to be wonderful on long trips.  You just don't get as tired when you have the ability to change the seats so easily without stopping.  Because of the way the car glides along with little effort, you don't get as much fatigue.  The size and weight of the car also makes you feel safer on today's high speed roads. The leather seats are comfortable year round and the size of the seats gives everyone comfort.  The back seat is just as comfortable.  The trunk has ample room for a families' needs on a trip.  Grocery shopping is much simpler when there is so much room in the trunk as well.

We have had absolutely no problems with our Lincoln and have only needed to take it in to the dealer for regular service.  Whenever we do, within a few days we receive a phone call asking if we were satisfied with the service or had any problems.  The answer is always &quot;We are happy--no problems&quot;.  The dealer's service department has been excellent and always leaves the car clean after working on it.  That is not the case with our other car.  I find I am wiping black fingerprints of grease off something or other.

When we are ready to get another big car, it will definitely be a Lincoln.<br><br>
