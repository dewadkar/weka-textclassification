            Acura.  Thoughts that come to mind?  Luxury.  Sleekness.  Reliability.  Fun.  Performance.  Those are the thoughts that come to my mind.  And the CL meets all of them.

I am an avid Acura fan.  I drive an Acura Integra Type-R.  My neighbor has an Acura Legend.  His dad has a Acura CL-Type-S.  My friend's neighbor has the king of all Honda's:  an Acura NSX.  All these cars are great cars.  With the new Cl, I think Acura gave it self a big boost.  There was a huge gaping hole in Acura for the 2 door lux coupe, as the previous first generation CL wasn't quite that competitive, and BMW and Volvo were eating it up.  But then the new CL came out, and it changed everything.  

Inside:  
Everything is standard on this car.  The only option you can get is Navigation.  Inside, it has the luxury you would expect from Acura, the leather, everything neat, nothing feels too cheap.  But I don't like it too luxiourious, and the Cl isn't.  
The seats are comfortable, and I feel I could drive far distances in the car.  Its all power, and as I said, they're great.  Visibility is good, I can see everything I need to see.  And, I can see that inside the fit and finish is top quality; everything is aligned.  Thats good news.    The shifter, has the Type S across it, and it looks very nice.  
The car has ample space to put all of your goods.  Its got some pockets and spaces.  The dash is well laid out, and very nice.  All controls are eaisly in reach. 
I would give it 5/5 stars.  

Powerplant:
VTEC.  Those four letters spell fear in my eyes.  When the change over occurs, the car pulls.  I am quite aware of it, as my car blares to 9000 rpm.  However, the CL is quick... Almost as quick as my car...  And that scares me.  260 hp.  out of a V6.  Wow....  97 Mustangs made about that much out of a V8.  VTEC allows the broad torque range, and allows the car to pull anywhere.  Ample passing power is great.  The manual shifting thing is odd..  It's kinda fun, but it doesn't even come close to the feeling of a manual.  I wish there was a 6 speed in this.
I would give it 4/5 stars, because of no manual.  

Handling:
The handling on this car is good.  I can take turns at some speeds people usually wouldn't.  It has good response, and a good steering feel.  But the only thing I don't like is it feels a little big.  It also has the driver assist (VSA), which keeps you in check incase you start to drive past the limits of the car.  Jeez, cars today.  They can do everything.
Handling: 4/5 stars.  I guess I'm just used to the handling on my car, that everything else seems kinda bland.

Looks:  
Personally, I like the way the car looks.  Look at the 1st generation CL.  My oh my did we come a long way.  I can see, however, why some people may not like it.  But the lines are clean, and it looks like a sophisticated car.  It looks like its refined, well trained.  
Check out those rims!  Man, they're nice.  But... Heres something I found out about them.  If you take it to a car wash, it rubs against the track.  That scratches them, and they rust.  Jeez, what's Acura thinkin here?
Overall, you pull up to this car, and you couldn't think it did 0-60 in 6.5.  It seems too neat and refined to.  Well now...
I give it: 5/5.

Overall:  
Ok, I think this is a great daily driver, and a great car to go on road trips in.  Its comfortable (you can sit in the back!), its smooth, and its nice inside.  The performance is great.  Personaly, I would pick this car to drive to school everyday.  The build quality on Honda's are great.  We have a Honda Odyssey.  Problems?  none.  Honda Civic.  Problems?  none.  Acura Integra.  Problems?  only one, my window is a bit off.  All these cars are at least 2 years old, the Civic 6.  So, I can only assume that the CL carries the same refinment as the others.  
I think Acura is bringing back its performance edge, and I love that.  The CL can now compete with the BMW.  I love its looks, it's acceleration, and its interior.  
overall:
5/5.
