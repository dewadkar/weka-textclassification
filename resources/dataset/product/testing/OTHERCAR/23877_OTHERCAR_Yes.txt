            I have owned my 1998 Buick Century for two years now.  I absolutely love this car.  

PROS:
1.  Very quiet car to drive. When my friend drove us to Reno, he had to ask me if the engine was running after starting it.  It really is that quiet.
2.  The car has a reliable 3.1 L V6 engine.  It is not a speed demon, but it has ample power when you need it.
3.  Ride is smooth.
4.  Interior is very large.  A man can stretch his legs while driving.  Lots of room in the back seat for adults.
5.  Power and automatic everything.  I haven't touched my light switch in two years.  The lights come on when it gets dark and turn off by themselves.  
6.  Nice big trunk.
7.  Usually priced a heck of a lot less than other full size cars, especially the Ford Taurus, but the Century is far superior in drive, style, and built in equipment.
8.  It has a very attractive body style.

CONS:
1.  The steering is soft.
2.  The front seat is a split-bench.  A bucket would have been better.

I'm truly glad I discovered Buick when I was looking for a car last time around.  I was resigned to settling for a Taurs or Lumina when I saw a Buick Century beside me on the road.  After checking them out I knew a Buick was for me.  The Buick looked better and included more bang for the buck than other cars.
