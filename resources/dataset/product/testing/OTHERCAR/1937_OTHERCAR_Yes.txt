            In July, 2000 we decided to buy a new car. Our price range was 35,000 or under. My husband wanted an SUV and I wanted a sedan.  He likes European, I liked American. Believe me, this was divorce material!
 We had never bought a car new.....somehow whenever we thought we might be able to some crisis came up....a child couldn't get financing for a semester, the chiminey fell apart, the roof leaked...whatever...there was always something emergent that had to be prioritized......but in July of 2000, we were feeling pretty confident......

So, we decided to look at Japanese cars...I was ready to hit the dealerships....my husband was ready to hit Epinions and Consumer Reports.....

In August, 2000, we embarked on a journey down "Auto Row".
1st we went to Toyota. We test drove the 4Runner, Avalon, and Camry. I liked the Camry SE, he liked the 4Runner. 
Next we stopped at Honda. He liked the CRV (he said the Passport was just an over-priced Isuzu), I liked the Accord SE. Things were not going well. By the time we got to Nissan we were arriving in seperate vehicles.

First we went for a looonnnnnng drive in the Pathfinder, I sat in silence, not making one single comment about how I felt like I was riding in a jeep over the outback. I even sat in the back seat so that he wouldn't be able to "read" my body language. Afterall, my marriage was on pretty shaky ground, at this point. I stilll wasn't willing to totally aquiesce, but I was close. It was during this intermittable test drive that I started to figure out how much leverage I would have, for what, and for how long if I gave in. This was a biggy!!!! If I couldn't have the car of my choice, I was going to get it's weight in gold later on!

As we approached the dealership, and my knuckles were starting to regain some normal coloring, the salesman asked if we would like to take a ride in the Maxima, "just for the heck of it!". Having decided to give in, I didn't reply. My husband, sensing victory, suddenly became very magnanimous. He even sounded ethusiastic as he said, "Why Not?!" Little did he know the price he was really going to pay for that da**ed truck!, I thought, snarling silently, smiling outwardly.

As we approached the line of Maximas, one in a deep, rich mahogany color caught my eye. It was so pretty in the sunlight! As it happened, it was the same one my husband stopped at! He walked around and around it, looking at the wheels, body, and sticker. This was the sports one so it had the spoiler and mag wheels with 17 inch tires so it was a really impressive looking vehicle. Not that I wanted to be hopful, but I did see my husband's face relax a bit, and I would swear there was even the hint of a smile as he looked inside at all the leather and at the wheels....

Off the lot we went, me ensconsed in the VERY comfortable back seat. Fred at the wheel, the now on my hitlist salesman next to him. After fiddleing with the buttons for a minute Fred turned on the radio and I was suddenly surrounded by jazz from a great Bose system, that, as it turned out, is standard in the SE.  We got on Rt. 80 and drove for several minutes. I was feeling really good about this little car! I started looking out the windows and realized that the trees were really whipping by. Now me, I've been known to have a little 'lead in the foot', but Fred? Not Fred! 70 is about his top speed. Those trees were doing more than 70 or there was something hallucinagenic in the air. I unobtrusively looked over Fred's shoulder at the speedometer and we were cruising at 85!
I hadn't even felt the acceleration! And Fred was smiling! One of those soft little smiles people get when they are secretly pleased. I'm sure those little smiles are unconsious. Fred would have no more let me in on his little secret than the man in the moon! This was war, after all. 

I heard the smarmy, traitorous salesman say it was about time to head back......I saw Fred ignore him....Oops...there goes another...exit!.....
Now we're not kids, Fred and I.  Heck, Fred had recently gotten an invitation to join the AARP! However, it took two more requests from the salesman before Fred tuned in enough to exit and head back to the dealership!

When we all got out of the car, Fred made another trip around it and headed straight back towards the showroom offices. I told "Mr. Smarmy" to call me in when I needed to sign. I was feeling just a tad irritable...just a tad my backside....Oh well.....The price of that truck was going up expoentially with my anger until I had my own little secret smile to sport!

The papers signed, me in a blind snit, literally, Fred and I started to walk over to a neighboring McDonalds to wait.
I hadn't even looked at what I was signing. Mr. Smarmy had, oh so solicitously, put little red X's everywhere my signature was needed so all I had to do was zero in on the little red spots. Each one had, by the way, been a red flag signaling me to up the ante on just how much leverage I was going to excercise!

About a half hour and much tension later, we saw "Mr. Smarmy Sleazebag" himself waving for us to come on back over to the dealership. When we got to him he handed Fred a large manilla envelope and keys. He started walking towards the lot but it wasn't until we had walked about ten yards, or so, that I realized we were headed towards the Maximas and not the Pathfinders!!!!!! We stopped at the pretty mahogany one and Fred, with an evil twinkle in his eye, handed me the key!!!!!!!

Fast forward a year, and 16,000 miles........Oh how I love this car!!!!!!!!!....and so does Fred!!!!!!......He said it was the great response, and tight suspension that made him change his mind.......his only apprehension had been that the 2000 was the first year for a new, upgraded engine design but Nissan, and particularly Maximas, had a long excellent reliability reputation so he was willing to take a chance. I don't know about the older versions, but this one has plenty of power!!

The ride isn't as smooth as the other cars we tested. It has a stiffer, slightly more rigid suspension, typical of high performance sports cars. This allows it to have the great handling around corners and on steeply banked curves. 
It has gotten excellent milage on highway trips, slightly better than the 28mpg that was estimated. The Nissan dealership has held to it's high reputation for speedy, reliable service when we have taken it for scheduled maintenance. We have had absolutly no mechanical problems. 

The only significant, "significant" being subjective, problem we have encountered is that the paint chips very, very easily. Not big monster chips. Lots of little "dings". Especially on the hood where small pebbles fly up and hit it and at the key entry from the key. It may be just this particular color. Another draw back is that when we have to replace the tires it will cost about a thousand dollars. This model came with 17", high performance, wide tires. And, this vehicle must use premium gasoline. Given what has happened in that market, it has made the estimated fuel efficiency a joke! Last winter I found myself irritated at how long the rear window took to defrost but that may have been my impatience as opposed to it really having been a long time!
Allthough not a problem, it comes with only an average warranty. (30,000 drive train) We had to purchase seperately an extended warranty. (100,000 or six years), and this was a bit pricey. We paid approx. 1,800.00 for this.

Overall, we couldn't be happier with this car. It isn't for the feint of heart. It accelerates so easily that you don't realize how fast you are traveling unless you keep a close eye on the speedometer. The stereo is wonderful. IThe car looks great! The trunk is roomy enough for lots of groceries, dog stuff, etc. It came with one of those cargo nets and the back of the trunk has an opening into the body of the car if you have something extra long to carry. The leather seats have held up well. There are lots of little storage places in both the front and back.
The dashboard is laid out well, with everything easily visable and reachable for the driver. The instrument panel is easy to read and the night colors are easy on the eyes. It has a lumbar adjustment for the driver's seat that is nice. The front seats have warmers that came in handy this past winter. The side mirrors are heated as well as the rear window. It has a great sunroof that opens and closes with one touch. The electric windows continue to close even after you turn off the ignition so you don't have to sit there holding the button first.

It is our plan to keep this car another five years and as it stands now there doesn't seem to be any reason why that won't happen. I hope this has been helpful, and as always, you are welcome to e-mail me with any questions you may have.
Thanks so much for taking your time to read this!
