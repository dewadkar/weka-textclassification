            I feel that this camera is the best digital camera of its day.  It made it into last year's (1999) &quot;best products of the year&quot; list, and I feel that it deserves it, here's why.

I bought this product because my mom is a realtor and she needed a (good) camera that she could take (good) pictures of her clients houses with and print them out in her documents.  It was coming to the end of the year and realtors are hit hard by taxes and my mom needed some write-off money, so she told me to look around and find the best one.  I searched all over looking for the best digital camera on all the popular and most up-to-date reviewer sites, like www.cnet.com and www.zdnet.com.  I found that the Kodak DC-260 came up on all of them and that it was the editor's choice.  That and it's (list) price tag at $1000 was almost perfect for the write-off.

I found it cheapest for $850 dollars, which was right after it came out so I thought it was a great find.  I know it is expensive but after using it I determined that it was money well spent!  There are so many bells and whistles that some of them I haven't yet used, and I am a techie and a gadget lover!

---Features---
1. 3 different size still frame captures: Low(768x512), Medium(1152x768), High(1536-1024)
2. 3 different quality settings: low, medium, high. (more or less jpeg compression)
3. 3X optical zoom and 2X digital zoom (for 6X overall)
4. 2&quot; TFT color LCD screen (for preview/review)
5. A great menuing system (colorful and easy to navigate through)
6. Optional Sounds (shutter sound and button ticks)
7. &quot;Time Lapse&quot; and &quot;Burst Capture&quot; settings
8. Automatic orientation (when you use the camera sideways it rotates the picture)
9. Video out (for use if you want to show the family on the TV)
10. Audio recording and playback (not very useful)
11. Serial, USB, Infrared, and PCMCIA (can't use PCMCIA unless you have the memory card converter)
12. Self timer (for setting the camera up and jumping in front of it to take a picture of yourself)
13. Many adjustable camera options: exposure, aperture range, shutter speed.
14. Tripod mount and external flash hookup.

When I bought it I didn't realize it had so many different features, so it was quite exiting to play with when I got it.  The high resolution shot with the quality set to best, is perfect to print out a 4x6 photo quality print.  And when I say &quot;photo quality&quot; I mean like a regular camera with the old style film.  It's a great camera but it is fairly high in the price range, today (9-14-2000) you can get a DC-290 for about $600 and a DC-260 for $500.  I believe this camera would be great for those who want to be able to take great pictures and archive them.  The camera has lasted quite well with over a year of abuse since 1-99, and I use it for everything.

There are some things that I don't like about it too, though I do feel that it is an excellent camera.

---Bad Things---
1. Slow recovery time, when you take two pictures you have to wait a few seconds for the camera to let you take more pictures
2. It takes 4-AA batteries, and rechargeable Ni-Cd batteries don't last very long
3. Using the LCD as a viewfinder isn't very effective, the motion is jerky and the picture is discolored, it also kills the battery quick
4. When turning on and off the camera it has to extend and retract the lens, which makes noise and takes some time and battery power too.
5. Comes with a relatively small memory card, only 8 megabytes!  You can fit 8-10 highest res. pictures on this card.  It would be preferred to buy a 32meg bigger card.
