            I bought this car as a quick last minute decision.  My previous car had died, and I refused to purchase another unreliable beater.  I test drove a few cars, and figured the Accent was the way to go.  It was cute and had power windows.  I was sold.  (Yes, salesmen love me)  It's a white 4 door GL sedan, with an auto transmission, power locks and windows.

I figured I'd keep the car for a year and then get something more sporty.  Here it is 2 years later and I can't part with it!  It is the most reliable car I've ever owned.  I'll admit, when it comes to car maintenance, I am pathetic.  I made it my New Years resolution to take better care of her, January 2nd marked the 2nd oil change in as many years.  Even with the way I treat her, she starts for me every day and never complains about the cheap gas I give her.  Next present is a tune up, but from the way it runs you'd never guess I neglect that stuff so badly.  The engine is quiet and it passed a recent air care test with flying colours.

The only issues I've had have been my fault.  Don't get in an accident with it.  The front end crumpled pretty quick when I rear ended someone (lightly).  Before I blinked, I had caused 3,000 (CAN) in damage to my car alone.  Although another time I was rearended pretty hard and the back held up quite well considering.  

The seats aren't the most comfortable in the world...  It does have a manual lumbar adjustment for the driver seat though.  The passenger seat can cause a numb bum after long trips.  I sat in it for 10 hours straight one time and it wasn't that bad, but my husband whines about it.  Maybe I just have more cushioning.

The back seats aren't exactly roomy, but you don't want people back there anyways.  The car isn't known for it's peppy engine, and with 4 people in the car you can feel like you are towing a boat.  I could just have fat friends though.

I could complain about the automatic transmission as well, but I have a feeling any issues with that is my fault.  It can shift pretty hard sometimes.  A transmission fluid change would fix that.

All in all, it has everything I need.  Plenty of cupholders, very cheap on gas, and it's cute.  The trunk has plenty of space.  Even with the huge subs my husband figured the car needed.  I love my little Accent, and can't see myself ever getting rid of it.
