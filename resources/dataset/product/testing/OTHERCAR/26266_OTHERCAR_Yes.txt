            I was itching to upgrade from my Civic HX (not a bad little car), and I knew the Si wouldn't be around long.  I had to have it.  It comes completely equipped, is carefully built, will last for years and years if properly maintained, and it goes like hell.

I like the styling.  The exterior is subdued; tasteful(without the hideous, optional rear wing).  It doesn't need to be pretentious or crass like many other sporting cars.  It has a graceful, classic shape that will age well.  Exclusive 15" 7-spoke alloy wheels gleam invitingly, wrapped in V-rated Michelin rubber.  Inside, the cabin is roomy, with abundant leg room up front. Typical Honda ergonomics and quality construction are apparent.  The electronic HVAC controls work flawlessly!  Three simple knobs allow custom air settings quickly and simply.  The steering wheel and shift knob are wrapped in smooth, grippy leather.  The overall feel is that of a more expensive car.  The glass sunroof is a first for me, and I love it.  Open it, tilt it, or close it altogether, it is as tight as a drum.  Construction is solid, with no squeaks or rattles.  On the road, there is virtually no wind noise (but tire roar is pronounced).

The car runs so beautifully:  Whisper quiet at idle, screaming like mad at full throttle, and then back to whisper again.  When you open this little ninja up, blasting to the 8000rpm redline, heads turn! (including Smokey's, so be careful).  Sure, there are some faster cars (for much more $$$), but I can't think of another one that lets you enjoy the speed quite the way the Si does.  It kranks.  It grabs the pavement, too, thanks to substantial  modifications to the excellent double wishbone suspension.  Twisting freeway on-ramps can be soooo fun.  Is your exit coming up?  No need to apply the brakes.  Don't try these moves in your SUVs, kids.

The down sides are few, including the need for premium fuel, which has been quite expensive in these parts, and (if you are smart) fully synthetic oil for the hot-running, high-compression engine.  A sixth gear would improve highway mileage and reduce noise, as RPM at 70mph hovers in the 4000 range.  The stereo needs more power, although the sound is very crisp and clear.  The time of day and the radio station are not visible simultaneously, a minor annoyance.  The cup holder must have been an afterthought.  Many cups will not fit snugly into the holder, so a mildly sporty move can leave you reaching for the rug shampoo.  The ride is decidedly firm, typical of a small coupe with a sport suspension.  On the weather-beaten New England roads on which this car typically travels, however, it can at times be tiresome.  

Minor complaints aside, this is one very special car.  It's a Civic with an Acura NSX soul.  It was available for sale in small numbers for only 2 model years (99-00).  It isn't a car for anyone who wants to be isolated from the driving experience.  It isn't for people who equate silence and mushy seats with quality, either.  It is, rather, those who wants a driving experience that heretofore could only be had with a far more expensive vehicle.  This is the Civic Si.  It is a modern classic.

12/2001 - Still no problems with the car, even with plenty of aggressive driving.  If anything, the car feels smoother and more eager to go since break-in!  I'm glad I got it.
