Relying on Nissan Pathfinders reputation, the QX4 appeased the upmarket SUV market.  It is by far not a Pathfinder!  It does capture the ruggedness of the Pathfinder but with a flare.

Overall the vehicle is extremely reliable.  Not your hard-core 4X4 due to all the luxury appointments both outside and inside.  Apart from the normal issue present in every new vehicle, this vehicle will continue to be popular.

It could have used a little more headroom and an 8 cylinder as an option for those who need to pump the blood back into their hearts.  It handles adverse road conditions extremely well thanks to it's refined 4X4 system.

It is a vehicle worth having.  It may look like a dressed up Pathfinder, but it's not!
