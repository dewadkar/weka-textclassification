            If your looking for really fun car, that gets noticed, may I suggest the Chevrolet Camaro Z28 Convertible.  I bought this car a little over a year ago, and I love it.  The Z28 version of the camaro comes with the LS1 350ci V8.  This engine produces 305HP and 335lbs-ft torque.  All that torque translates into a real gas 'n go car.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is one fast car.  A popular car magazine just did a comparison between the 1999 Z28 convertible-automatic and the 1999 Mustang GT convertible-automatic, and the results were far in the Z28's favor.  They tested the Z-28 at 0-60 in 5.5 secs, and the mustang at 6.5 secs.  My previous car was a 1996 Corvette, and in my opinion, the Z-28 is just as fast.  There were some differences though, between the 2 engines.  The LT1 in the Vette, and in pre-98 Z-28's had a little more bottom end punch, however, the LS1 has more high end umph!  The LS1 redlines at about 6100 rpm, and LT1 would redline at about 5000rpm.  The car does handle very well.  My only complaint is the Goodyear Eagle RS-A tires on the car.  They're fine for casual everyday driving and good for all-weather, but they are NOT high performance tires.  They just don't hold the road very good at all.  Suggestion: get the Eagle GSC's on the car instead; they are an option.  The leather seats are comfortable, but not cushy.  They are much more comfortable than the Mustangs rock hard washboards they make you sit on.  

The convertible top is easy to operate also.  Just unhook 2 latches, and with the press of a button, the top automatically goes down.  If you want to use the boot, however, you will have to get out of the car to manually put the 3-piece instrument on. It does take a minute or two.  I find it much easier to leave the boot off, and can go convertible or back in seconds, and not have to get out of the car.  There is not really that much of difference in aesthetics with the boot on or off, so I go for convenience.  The car also gets pretty good gas mileage.  I do a decent amount of freeway driving, but I do hit a lot of traffic and I still manage about 19-21 mpg.  On a trip to Vegas, I averaged about 25 mpg!

Very fun car, but not for families, unless you already have your family cars!
