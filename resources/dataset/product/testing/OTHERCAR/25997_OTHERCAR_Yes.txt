                 I purchased a 2000 Chevy Cavalier yesterday, 12/21/99, and I love this car.  I was a little wary, even though I had test driven it of the comfort level...because it seems so small and I am not a size two.  However now that I have been running around for twenty-four hours, I am thrilled.  The car was on the lot, not special order...so there I kind of took the car as is in the options department, but I love it.  The windows open up the feel of the car from it's being so compact, as your driving it feels like your surrounded by windows.  The car drives smooth as silk, and has great power.  My last car was a v-6 so I was a little concerned about the v-4, but it purrs right along.  The seats are comfortable, the controls are easy to reach/learn and use.  

     There are only a couple small things that I don't &quot;like&quot;, but they are far outweighed by the positives.  The car does not have tilt steering which I would prefer, and there is not an ashtray in the car.  I am a smoker so that's an issue for me, however there is enough &quot;vanity&quot; room in between the seats with the cup holders, storage area and flat area that I can easily fit in an ashtray for use.  I think they went a little overboard with the cup holders, there are two in the front and three throughout the fold out vanity.  I find that a little excessive because if I had two people in the front and three adults tucked in the back, there would not be a lot of room to open the vanity and utilize the holders.  
     *****I don't know about &quot;reliability&quot; yet, the car is only 24 hours old.
