            My husband and I along with our two children, bought a 1999 yellow beetle last year. We both loved the idea of this bright happy car, and were attracted by the great mileage per gallon (we got a diesel). My husband is 6'4&quot; and has a hard time finding cars that are big enough for him I ,on the other hand am 5'1&quot; and have a hard time not getting lost in cars. The bug gives the illusion of being in a spacious car, with the high ceilings and extremely adjustable seats, yet supplies the comfort and control of a small car. The only drawback to the bug is that we can't fit our stroller in it, and that it has room for three in the back, but only two seat belts. The bug has great handling on the road and is a blast to drive! You should buy this car if you want a safe, attention getting, comfortable, fun vehicle. You shouldn't buy this car, as an only car, if you have 2 or more children, need to carry a sroller in it or don't like kids punching each other when you drive by!! <br><br>
