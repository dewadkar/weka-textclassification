            This was to be the summer I let my freak flag fly. 30 years old in '03, I've been driving a beat up - but extremely reliable - 1991 VW Cabriolet for six years while I patiently waited for VW to get off its duff and release the convertible version of the New Beetle. FINALLY, after taking anal-retentiveness to a new extreme, VW releases it, and it is gorgeous. Like butter. Just as I'm contemplating which color scheme would go best with my wind-whipped hair, and how much it would cost to have it custom painted hot Barbie pink instead, my boobs start to swell to unnatural proportions and Aunt Flo runs off with a trucker.

And I hear it's a mother-lovin' pain in the tush to get a carseat in 'n out of a two-door car, even if the top goes down.

So, I had to start thinking sensible. Safe. Four-doors. Lots of trunk space. Brother Nifer, also a VW connoisseur, suggested the Eurovan. He's recovering nicely.

I was hearing good things about the 2003 Jetta, so I decided to give one a test drive, and fell in love. I picked up my new ride on Tax Day. Two weeks later, facing the expiration of his leased Pontiac Grand Prix and drooling over all the fine German-crafted details of my Jetta, Mr. Nifer went out and got himself a 2003 Jetta, too. Ain't we cute? If we start to dress the same, one of us will have to die.

The feature I love most about our Jettas is that they have automatic transmission. Since I received my driver's license, every car I've owned - that would be all four of them, prior to this one - has had manual transmission. I used to think it was cool that I could drive stick. No car was off-limits to me. However, after getting stuck in one-too-many snow-induced two-hour 'burbs-to-Milwaukee traffic jams, I've decided that cool isn't so important anymore. Manual transmission totally rocks.

The downside is that in the GLS version of the 2003 Jetta, which both of our cars happens to be, the get-up-n-go got up and went. Even in my old Cabriolet, I could blow past all but the sports cars from the traffic light with little effort. Now I don't even bother, especially since the 2003 Jetta can be a bit noisy when you push the engine. Once you get to your cruising speed, the engine is much quieter and the ride is smooth, but I definitely recommend keeping your eye on that speedometer - it's very easy to sail along at 90 or 100 (it goes to 160 - oh, how I wish I could do that, just once!) without even feeling like you're speeding. Or, maybe that's just me. I dunno - I've had a few tickets in my day.

The seats in both our cars are leather, and the two up front are bucket and individually heated - a very lovely combination. I've never been a big fan of leather seats before this, because they always seem extra-frigid in the winter, and burning hot in the summer. At least the heated seats solves half of this problem. The heat can be cranked up from 0 (no heat - duh) to 5 (lots of bun-toasty goodness). On the cold days, I recommend cranking that heat up to 5 until you feel the burn, then easing off to 4 or 3 to maintain the warmth.

The 2003 Jetta has the standard heat/AC system with the standard options you'll find in most any car today - defrost, upper, lower, etc. There is also an air recirculation option that I have to admit I really haven't used yet. Since the weather finally got nice in Milwaukee I've just had the power windows and sunroof/moonroof combo open most of the time.

Speaking of windows, it's been a long time since I've owned a new car (okay, that's actually never - this is my first brand-new car) so I'm not sure if this is a standard feature in most/all new cars these days, but the 2003 Jetta has a cool anti-pinch feature in the power windows. Because there is driver-controlled one-touch up/down functions in the windows, it is possible for a little one to put a hand/foot/head/pet/etc. within the path of the window when the driver isn't looking, and get a good squashing. But those crazy Germans thought of everything, and if your little peach puts his/her anything in the way of the closing window, the window will sense this and open instead, much as an elevator door does when you stick your hand in it. I tested it and it does pinch a little, so still expect some crying, but at least you won't be cruising to the ER.

There are actually a lot of cool little details in the 2003 Jetta that you might not expect to see in a car in the $20,000 price-range (depending on the model and the extras). For example, the exterior mirrors are heated. The mirrors behind the visors have open/close panels, and the lights above those mirrors only come on when the panels are open. There is a little flap that comes down and blocks the front overhead light from shining into the rear-view mirror. There are three headrests across the backseat, all of which are removable if one/all bothers you and/or you want to put the seats down to expand the already massive trunk. You can also choose to put just two of the three seats down, leaving the third for a passenger, or put just one down, leaving two seats for passengers. There is a full-size spare tire with all the necessary tire-changing parts under a removable panel in the trunk. The trunk also has a release lever, in the event someone gets locked in there.

One feature that it appears they're still working out is the cup holder. In my 2003 Jetta, the cup holder is in the dash, above the digital radio/CD player, and when you pop it out James Bond-style, it completely covers the face of the radio and the entrance to the CD player, although it still gives you just enough room to press the pre-programmable station buttons. In Mr. Nifer's 2003 Jetta, a slightly newer version than mine, this seems to have been corrected by moving the emergency brake closer to the driver and putting two molded cup holders directly under the armrest. However, if you have a tall cup, this is still inconvenient because the armrest now has to be lifted completely vertical, blocking some of the view from the backseat. Personally, I prefer the cup holder in my 2003 Jetta, even though it blocks the radio/CD player. I like that it grips the cup, and even though you'd think one big bump would send your beverage flying all over your radio, I've yet to experience a problem with that.

As long as we've migrated to the backseat, let me be clear - I won't be taking any of my taller friends and family for long road trips in this car, at least not with them in the back. I am 5'4" and can sit relatively comfortably in the back, but I can't imagine anyone pushing 5'9" or over would want to be back there very long. What did appeal to us about the backseats is the LATCH system that works in conjunction with today's infant carseat systems. Basically, through a little maneuvering of the backseat, you can anchor the base of an infant seat to the frame of the car, keeping that car seat in one spot no matter what happens to you on the road.

For the parents and kids big enough to be in the front, there are airbags galore in this puppy. If we ever are in a major accident, I imagine we'll be so surrounded by airbags that broken glass won't even touch us.

Lastly - and for some the most important feature - the stereo. The 2003 Jetta comes with a standard digital Monsoon AM/FM stereo with single-disk CD player. They call it "Monsoon" because the little speakers are strategically placed throughout the car to envelope you in sound, just as a real monsoon would envelope you if you were in the middle of it. All I know is, this stereo rocks, and I apologize in advance to all you I might now be parked next to at the stop lights. I'm the one crankin' da' base baby, makin' your windows 'n teeth rattle. I can't help myself. Although, sometimes it's Vivaldi instead of Eminem - classical music has kickin' base, too.

Anyway, it's possible to pre-program up to 18 individual FM and 18 individual AM stations total, or you can do what Mr. Nifer and I do - divide the FM, FM1, and FM2, and AM, AM1, and AM2 pre-programmable sections to each other so we always know where our personal favorites are, no matter which car we're in. For your CDs, there's plenty of room in the glove box for many, or you can always keep a few favorites handy in the door.

Overall, we're both extremely pleased with the comfort, style, features, and extras of our 2003 Jettas, especially since they get around 38 miles to the gallon (highway) and each came with four-year/50,000 mile warranties. We also received free memberships to the VW Club, another fun perk and nice way of saying "thanks" to two VW loyalists.
