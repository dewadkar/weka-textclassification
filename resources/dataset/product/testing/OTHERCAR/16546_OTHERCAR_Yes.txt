            The 240sx is a great car. Period. It combines the reliability of a Nissan and the fun of a sports car all in fun. Rear wheel drive is fun during the summer, but for those who live in areas where it snows during the winter, its not so fun. Small and quick, the 240 handles like a dream. The 2.4 liter DOHC has plenty of low end torque, but could definatly use a 6 cylinder (hence the 300zx). The close ration tranny makes the car very responsive up to 100 mph, but buzzes on the highway, running at about 3000 rmp. For a first-time sports car owner like myself, the 240 was an excellent upgrade. The car handles like a dream, especially with wider wheels than stock. The suspension is comfortable but tight enough to prevent bodyroll, especially when only carrying the driver. Overall, the 240 is a fun car, reliable and just great to drive. PS- the back seat is a smidge small!!<br><br>
