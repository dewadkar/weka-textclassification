I bought this car back in 1992 with 12,000 miles on it...now, 241k miles later, I'm saying, &quot;Damn, I bought a pretty reliable car!&quot; Other than normal maintenance expenses, (such as oil changes, tires, brakes, spark plugs, and replacing the timing belt) I haven't had to do much to the car but put in gas. Speaking of gasoline, the stick, delivers approximately 33 miles to the gallon/freeway and roughly 26 miles/city. To this day, there are no leaks whatsoever. The Handling is excellent like that of a sports car, however I wish the vehicle had more horsepower.  

There are only a few cons to owning this car. The A/C system is pretty weak, you lose major horsepower when you run the air conditioning. As a matter of fact at the age of 9 years, there's an apparent leak in the A/C system. I recently had the A/C recharged with Freon but it has all escaped in 3 months. There is hardly any room for rear passengers. If they're 8 years or younger, they'll fit fine, but if we're talking about 2 full grown adults, forget it. 

At 9 years, the paint job is still shines (hardly any oxidation). I do keep up with regular car washes and waxing too.

I must mention that this is a considered a compact car and for those of you whom are taller than 6 foot in height and weight more than 190 pounds probably won't fit well into the driver seat or passenger seat. (not very comfortable for long trips)  

I highly recommend the 92 Paseo to college students for its reliability and unbeatable gas mileage.  <br><br>
