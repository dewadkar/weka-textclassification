            Great cars are produced by auto makers who build cars the way we want them made.  Designers at Oldsmobile definitely did their homework when they designed the Oldsmobile Alero.  This car gives new excitement to the Olds line.  I have owned Oldsmobile's for ten years and I feel that they are some of the most solid cars around.  I purchased a 1999 Oldsmobile Alero GL Coupe in July of 1999.  This car is a joy to drive and always keeps me coming back for more.

Before purchasing this vehicle I did several comparisons to the Mercury Cougar and the Dodge Avenger.  The Alero was hands down the best handling and best designed of all the cars I tested.  The well rounded lines of the exterior are pleasing to the eye fluid throughout the design.  The rear lights are a bit too large and I do not especially care for the oval shape.  A rear deck lid spoiler tends to bring the eye away from the large size.  The Alero GL also comes standard with 15&quot; aluminum alloy six spoke rims although I opted for the 16&quot; alloys.

The interior of the Alero is very functional and comfortable.  The Alero possesses ample storage in both doors, center console, and overhead.  The GL comes standard with power doors, locks, leather trimmed steering wheel and shifter.  Great handling, styling, safety, and FUN to drive.<br><br>
