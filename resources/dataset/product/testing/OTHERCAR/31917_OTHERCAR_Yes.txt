            This has to be one of my favorite cars, by my favorite make, Subaru.  Tackle any highway with this sporty AWD car.  It's features include:
a. A totally new restyled design for 2001.  Same style, different look.  The new version just in case you were getting sick of the old style, just when you think the Forester couldn't be better, it got better, a lot better and just in time for 2001!
b. Combines the whole SUV deal with a smooth, car like ride.  So you have the control of a Durango, but a ride like a sports car.  It's perfect, I mean, you can't lose!!!
c. The usual for Subaru...the world famous AWD.  All Wheel Drive is awesome for any condition.  May it be a blizzard or a hailstorm, rain or shine.  The control of the car is outstanding and on a scale from 1 to 10, its an 11!
d. Its a cool car, I mean that shouldn't be your number 1 criteria for a car but it sure is up there!  I love the look.  Its fashionable yet futuristic.  Cool yet not tacky.  The colors are good too.  I recommend the forest gree color.
All in all, its a great car. Affordable, safe, dependable, stylish.  You can't lose.<br><br>
