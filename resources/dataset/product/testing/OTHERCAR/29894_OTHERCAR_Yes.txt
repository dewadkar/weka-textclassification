            I like the body style and stance of the Durango, Workmanship is good. I travel alot for work and the D really gives me a confident & safe feeling in any type of weather( live in Canada, so we get it all).  We pull a 21ft holiday trailer and there is no where I wouldn't go with this unit.
I do cringe every time I pass, if I get to pass a gas station.  The best mileage I have gotten so far is 16.5mpg and with the trailer 10mpg. I have the 5.9L c/w 3:92 rear end.
I do find the Durango is slow to respond to braking and if not careful can catch you having to stand on the peddle occasionally.
I find the acceleration is fine but not spectacular.  The ride is a bit like a truck but acceptable.  We are a family of six and have traveled long hours in the D and find it comfortable.
We have put 15k miles on it and so far no problems what so ever.
The Durango is a work horse and has an aggressive look with clean lines.  I think if you are looking for a good utility vehicle with some style, the D is a great choice.
