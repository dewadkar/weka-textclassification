            I purchased my 1998 Dodge Dakota because I was looking for a truck that wasn't full sized and was American made.  I liked the Dakota's 6 1/2 foot bed, longer than the competition.  

I went to Thomas Dodge in Orland Park, IL (if you want a car, go in and ask for Jennifer Sellars) where after a little bickering I was able to get the truck at a great deal.  However, watch out.  They originally wanted me to pay sticker and left no value for my car.  I did end up getting the truck for a little over what the dealer paid.

I have had my truck for two and a half years and have thirty thousand miles on it, which have been good to me.  The only problem I have had was that replacement paint for the bumpers is not available, which is a problem when rocks knick the bumper.  Hmmm.

Service has been great.  When I take my truck in for maintenance, they are upfront and honest.  I had a truck in for an oil change and they started working on it before 8:00 when they &quot;officially&quot; started working and finished fast.  Not to mention, their prices are <i>less</i> than the quick places.

Even better, when I went to college in Naperville, I began to have my service done at Koller Dodge, who treated me as if the truck came off their lot!!

Driving the vehicle has been great pleasure and I have received many compliments about its looks.  It has great pickup for being a V-6 and it doesn't have a ton of traction problems when there is ice on the road.  A great plus....

I would recommend this vehicle to anyone.  Truly a great truck.<br><br>
