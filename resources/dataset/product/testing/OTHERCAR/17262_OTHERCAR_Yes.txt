            Bottom line is that I had Ford Escort LX Sport 3-door before I had traded in to purchase this car new. My other car started to have problems, so it was time for it to go only after 3 years of owning it. 

In the spring had I had purchased a New Huge Dodge Intrepid ES for 1999, was fully loaded and I had a hard time finding this model with my features installed. I couldn't wait for it to be built, so I couldn't really get the color I wanted for the exterior, but the interior I found.

Only thing I found wrong with this car is it's hard to park it in any parking spot, because it's so huge and very long. Yes the 300-M is shorter by the nose; the LHS is even longer than the Intrepid by some more inches due to the trunk space is even bigger.

Mileage, since the Computer ROM update my mileage has increased from 28 to 29.7 on the highway even at speeds of 70 to 80 mph.

I can't say I didn't have trouble with this car, I have and since I am out warranty for this vehicle it hurts, for the Computer Rom Update really hurts, but I couldn't drive the car with out it because I had lost all control of the transmission, speed gauge only showed 0 and could only shift into 2nd, no 3rd or 4th gear.

They at the non-5 star dealer, told me both in and out speed sensors where bad and other things. Car was gone for two day's and after they fixed it, it drove well than it did.

Other things like bad motors in the power windows were stuck in up positions, and you couldn't get the dealer to fix them only if they had seen it in the up position. So one day they got stuck up and I had brought the car into the 5 star dealers and even it was 4 pm in the afternoon, they replaced the part for free. Told me it was a known issue. 

My front Rotors where giving me problems also, but several dealers could never trace that to my shaking steering wheel problem. But at the 5 star dealers they could, and replaced both rotors for free.

Otherwise the car is good, the tires on the ES, Goodyear Eagle GA, are not that good, I hate them! They have lasted over 51,500 miles so far and were rated to go only 45,000 miles. Yes that may sound good, but they are terrible in the snow and wet roads also. Dry roads okay!

Still today I am in the market to get rid of the Goodyearï¿½s tires, since I don't think they can go anymore, tread life is so bad you can see the head of Lincoln on a penny.
