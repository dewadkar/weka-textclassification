            I bought the 1999 Hyundai Accent four door I now drive because it lowered my monthly payment. Here's how it happened. I had to rent a car once when my problematic 1996 VW Golf III was on the fritz. I had my choice of a Ford Aspire or a Hyundai Accent. I knew I never was going to buy a Ford Aspire, so the Hyundai Accent made more sense. At least it was a kind of test drive. The car impressed me beyond my wildest expectations. The one I rented was the hatchback, although I wound up buying the four door. Acceleration was peppy. The design made for much more room than one can envision looking from the outside in. That takes talent. It was, all around, a pleasant experience. So when I went looking for my next car, I test drove a Hyundai Accent four door. It had the same great feeling. 

Of particular interest, I found that the Hankook tires which came standard gave me enough traction to make it up my steep driveway when covered with ice and snow! They are some of the best tires I have ever owned on a car and I have owned Dunlop, Michelin and Pirelli, Roadhandler, Centennial, Firestone, Goodrich, Goodyear and Vredestein over the years. 

Warranty work included a three trip to the shop trudge to get the trunk to close properly. It required body work. That's right. Not latch work. Body work. However, the work was done, done well and now everything is fine. 

I could wish for just a smidgeon more leg room. Perhaps if they hadn't put the grooved footrest in, that critical inch or two would be there. Still I am seldom if ever uncomfortable even on long drives and I am 5' 9&quot; tall.

The visor over the passenger side needed replacement as it began to fall down. However, none of things should put the buyer off! The engine purrs, the transmission is smooth shifting, everything is easily accessible for those who like to do their own work, the car has enough oomph to get you out into a merge or away from a maniac in road rage if you tromp on it and it handles like a dream. 

My chief complaint? I wish the radio were louder! That would be the stock radio that came with the car with tape deck. Oh, yes! The blower motor for the climate control system could be more powerful.

I own the beautiful mint green metallic color with the grey/beige interior. Nice. If you can just get over that infernal Hyundai phobia from their early fiasco era - you stand to own one of the best car values on the market today.

And you get a 60,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty!
