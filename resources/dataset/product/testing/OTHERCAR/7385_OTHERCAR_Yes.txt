            <b>Introduction</b>
My room mate was in the market for a car.  In spite of my problems with my Subaru Outback Sport, I turned him towards the Subaru WRX, and away from a BMW 325i.  He wanted more sport than luxury.  Since I knew the salespeople at the local dealership through my 1999 Outback Sport's numerous long rear wheel bearing repairs, they were able to give him a great deal.  He opted for the silver wagon with STi short-throw shifter.

<b>Performance</b>
This is not a drag-car.  SOA quotes a 0-60 in under 6 seconds, but don't try it.  As an AWD car, you'll quickly destroy your 1st or 2nd gear, and dealerships know to look for this sort of abuse.

In normal driving, power delivery is uneven due to the turbo'd nature of the car.  It lacks any real low-end torque, so you'll want to keep the tach needle above 3kRPM so you have punch when you need it.  This is no different than most other turbo'd vehicles, however.  On the highway, under boost, this vehicle is somewhere between the Mustang GT and Mustang Cobra in speed.  Not bad for a 2.0L 4Cylinder!

Handling is remarkable, but can be greatly improved by removing the factory Potenza RE92s and replacing them with a grippier tire.  The rear sway bar is small for this car.  Moving it to a 22mm turns it into a real canyon carver.  Stock, the handling is very agreeable with a bit of body roll.

<b>Comfort</b>
You'll either love or hate the driver's front seat.  If you're larger, like me and my friend, the side bolsters will push into your legs and cause pain over a long drive.  The seats are shorter than those on the GC8/GF8 (Previous Impreza body) designs, but offer more lateral support.  If you're smaller, you'll love the driver's seat.  If not, well...you'll suffer through it to enjoy the drive this car provides.  The passenger seat does not exhibit this problem, oddly enough.  Front leg room is adequate on both sides, nothing more.  The rear seats are moderately comfortable, but lack leg room.

The A/C and heat do their jobs very well.

<b>Accessories</b>
Wow, the car's loaded.  ABS, AWD with limited slip differential in the rear, 16" alloys, stock power everything, fog lights, etc. etc.  Wonderfully loaded.  Good job, Fuji Heavy Industries.  You didn't let Subaru of America mess it up.

<b>Looks</b>
The front is fugly in my opinion, but the rear looks classy.  All that matters is the rear since it's the only view most people on the freeway will see if you punch it.

<b>Overall</b>
Subaru of Japan and Fuji Heavy Industries have designed a real sports car with real utility that can be driven like a maw-maw (like my friend does) or driven in a spirited nature, as I do when at the wheel.  Kudos to not letting Subaru of America mess it up.  No more bearing problems either!
