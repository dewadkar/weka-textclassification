                 I have a Chrysler Cirrus that I have been driving for three years now.  Overall, I am very happy with it.  It is very roomy and comfortable. There is plenty of room in the back seat for passengers and the trunk is rather large as well. It rides extremely smooth too, and is very quiet.  I find myself speeding quite often without being aware of it because it feels like you're going much slower than you really are because it rides so well.  In three years I have driven almost 100,000 miles on it (I drive a lot) and it still appears to be in excellent shape.  The one serious problem I have with the car is the brake system.  I'm not sure if this is a general fault with Cirruses or just a personal shortcoming of my particular car, but I have already had to get over $1000 in repairs done to my brakes (this was two separate sets of repairs over the two years that were around $500 each)and this is not simply getting brake pads replaced.  Other than this particular problem though, I can't complain.  To be honest, I am not exactly perfect at keeping up with maintenance.  I go thousands of miles over what I should before getting oil changes and I haven't gotten a tune up at all, and yet, other than the brakes, my car is in great condition and still continues to run reliably.  The price is not particularly cheap for this car, but it is well worth what it does cost.<br><br>
