            This sport utility with the optional Automatic 4 wheel drive and locking rear differential is virtually unstoppable in most winter situations.  My first experience in snow allowed me to drive through it like it was rain.  Most other vehicles were slow and tepid.  However, the Jimmy plowed right by them effortlessly.

The only complainant I have so far is that the rear head rests are too big.  I can see where they might provide more safety in size.  However, you can not see through them and therefore are a hindrance to checking blind spots.  Additionally, rear seat passengers seem to be blocked from viewing forward.  Fortunately, I am in the command chair!

One other thing, the 'trunk' is even smaller than I thought it would be.

I highly recommend the vehicle to anyone wanting to upgrade to a glorified, modern day station wagon.<br><br>
