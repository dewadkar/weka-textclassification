            I currently own a 95 Hyundai Accent.  After just 48,000 miles the transmission blew. The radio also blew and the electrical in the car couldn't handle an alarm and a radio.  Yes, it is a cute car but the trouble that comes with the car is not worth it at all.  It also has the best warranty around but when buying a Hyundai you will need it.  The price of a Hyundai is very reasonable but I would rather buy a car I couldn't afford than buy another Hyundai due to the fact all the trouble it has put me through with all the defects in it.  It has been recalled at least 3 times for different defects.  Driving a Hyundai is like driving a moped with a cover on it.  The pick up on this car is so slow and it hesitates.  In my opinion I would never talk anyone into buying a Hyundai.<br><br>
