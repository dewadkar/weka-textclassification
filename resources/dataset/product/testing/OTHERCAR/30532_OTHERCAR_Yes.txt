            I did some research before buying a new camera. My main drive was camera reputation and resolution. I did my camera shopping through on line auctions since I had very little knowledge what was out there since it has been 4 yrs since I bought a camera. I felt 4MP would suffice after having an Olympus 2.1MP and Sony 0.3MP cameras I knew I'd see an improvement with the quality of pix. I did that quality but I always use the HIGHEST settings 4PM and "fine" setting. The pix look pretty good when I compare them to my other 2 cameras. Its very easy to use and there are a lot of bells and whistles I haven't toyed with just yet but so far I'm pleased for what I spent on the camera. Its very compact and easy to use. I'd recommend it if you're on a limited budget like me.

PROS: This is the lowest price 4PM I've seen. I did some research on Concord Cameras (www.concordcam.com) and they make cameras for companies like Polariod. I figured that a reputation like Polaroid, it had to be a good deal. The camera is easy to use, just like a point and shoot. The picture are sharp in comparison to my Olympus 2.1MP and Sony FD75, I always use the highest settings since I plan on printing my pix.

CONS: The flash range is under 10 feet, that is pushing it. What I hate most is that you can not preset your settings, every time you shut the camera off it goes back to its default settings.
