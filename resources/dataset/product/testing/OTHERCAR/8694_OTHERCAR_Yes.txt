            Hortense is our 1988 Honda Accord Coupe with 140,000 loving miles on it. We bought it for my wife Kelly because she had great luck with a previous Honda Civic 4 Dr. and because it fit her smaller frame; she loves the seats in this car! The purchase price in 1989 with only 14,000 miles on the odometer and in nearly new condition was only $13,500 from a Honda dealer. It has Leather Seats, Air Conditioning, Power Brakes, Power Steering, Cruise Control, Electric Windows, AM/FM Cassette Stereo (original!),a HUGE trunk with inside release, Heated Rear window. Everything still works after lo these last 12 years! Reliable beyond any automobile I've ever owned.

Still fun to drive it's low to the ground and handles well on it's 2nd set of Michelin Radial tires. It feels like a sports car without all the problems associated with the type. It's air tight, quiet, quick and smart looking. The paint has held up well with little except regular washing. The leather seats, alas, were VERY sun sensitive and sunny California claimed them with hardness, flaking and rigidity about 5 years ago. Now, I must say, Hortense has NEVER been garaged so gets the full rays of Sol every day of her life so take that into mind. We simply put on a nice set of sheepskin covers and soldiered on.

Mileage is very good for the 2.0 lire 4 cyl. OHV engine, we get 22 - 28mpg on unlkeaded regular depending on driving conditions. The cruise control is easy to use and aids gas mileage on longer trips. The automatic 5 speed transmission is very smooth shifting after the initial &quot;clunk&quot; when putting it into Forward. No &quot;hunting&quot; occurs on long uphill climbs, which is a real plus. 

Downside? Sure...those damned air conditioning/heater controls, huh? Wow are they complicated, lots of switches, lots of outlets, you can get fresh air, air conditioned HEATING for gods sakes! Many functions are simply incomprehensible and the manual is no help whatsoever, you just play it by feel. I wish we had electric door locks tho' as it's hard for Kelly to reach across and open the door from the inside, nut that's the list of negatives.

I's buy one again but probably won't live long enough to have to, I expect to see another 100,000 miles in another 10 years driving Hortense to and fro. What a fun, wonderful car!
