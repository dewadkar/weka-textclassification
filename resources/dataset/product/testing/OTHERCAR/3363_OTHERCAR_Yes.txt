            After a bad experience with a previous SUV, I am thrilled to say how much I love the 01 Pathfinder.  The ride and handling are outstanding.  The new peppy engine is quiet and competent.  This is one SUV you will love to drive!

The goodies are great:

--leather package includes: driver seat memory, power passenger seat, heated seats
--reclining rear seats
--flip out liftgate glass
--tonneau cover
--6 disk in dash CD player (the Bose system is great--beats the Infinity system in my last SUV
--climate control
--auto up/down on both front windows
--dual sun visors

Few minor complaints:

--small interior door handles
--key fob remote buttons are too small! I have a problem getting the doors unlocked because the button is so small
--back seats are too small for an adult to sit comfortably for long rides
--needs rear air conditioning

I can't say enough how great the ride and handling is in this vehicle compared to other SUVs I've driven:

Durango (owned for 16 months): bone jarring ride, skittery
4Runner: anemic engine, waaaay over priced
Trooper: too much lean for me (although well priced)

I highly recommend this vehicle.
