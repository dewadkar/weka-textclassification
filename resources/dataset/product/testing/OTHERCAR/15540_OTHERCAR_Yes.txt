            When the time came to buy a new car, I was first thinking of another mini van or SUV.Then I saw the Sebring JXI convertible.The way the car looked was very appealing, although being a big lady I had my doubts as to the comfort.The test drive convinced me that was not an issue.There is plenty of leg room and the seats are very comfortable.Never owning a sports car in my younger years made this sporty/luxury car so appealing I wanted to look further into it.Several opinions later I owned it.I must say I've never enjoyed a car more!With a routine week of over 40 hours driving time,this car makes it fun.Routine maintenance has kept it running like a top.The only problem I've had is with the digital tach.It stops lighting up on occasion,and although the dealer has taken it in, the problem remains.
 But if you're looking for a fun car,this is it!My next one will be a different color but positively A Sebring!<br><br>
