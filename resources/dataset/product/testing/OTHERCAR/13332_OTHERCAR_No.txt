            Love it or hate it, the "new" 2002 Accord is basically the same model that has been on sale for a couple years, and is not much of a change from the 1994 Accord.

First, this car is unnoticeable...which has its good and bad points.  If you are looking for a car to help your image, look somewhere else.  Even though the styling is very boring, it is still put together with precision.  The paint was flawless and there were no noticeable gaps in the body.

Next, on to the interior.  As expected ergonomics are basically perfect, everything is where you expect it to be.  There were no loose carpet pieces, exposed screws or anything similar showing that the excellent workmanship carried on into the interior.  The seats are decently comfortable, you get a little sore after a couple hours and I wouldn't even think of putting somebody with long-ish legs in the back seat.

Ah, performance.  The Accord does everything well but does not accel in an particular area...all performance aspects are middle-of-the-road.  The engine is quiet.(But for the price it should be).  Everything works as it is intended, no real sporting character here just a mundane daily transportation device.  Which brings me to the final point.

Is a basic transportation device work $24k+?  It all depends.  I feel there are much better bargains out there.  Take the Hyundai Sonata -- for thousands less you get a better equipped car with a warranty Honda can only dream of matching.  If you get a good deal (my experience is Honda is one of the dealers that likes to get as close to MSRP as possible), it might be worth it, especially in the short term because of the high resale value.  But if you are buying this car to "drive until the wheels fall off", you would be much better off with a Hyundai.  I would also recommend looking at the A4 -- a little more money, but a lot more car.
