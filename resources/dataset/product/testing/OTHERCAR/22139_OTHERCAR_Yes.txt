            I am a picture-taking FOOL!!! Still camera, video camera and especially my digital camera. I have wanted a digital camera since they first came out, but I refused to pay 5 or 6 hundred dollars for one. After a lot of searching and many hours on the internet I finally found the Kodak DC215. When my husband purchased it for me as a Christmas gift in 1999 it cost  $299.99. I have found that the price has stayed fairly close to that. 
The only drawback that I have found with this camera is that unless you have an awesome printer, you won't have the actually picture in your family photo albums. I would recommend this camera for anyone interested in sending pictures via email or sharing photos with friends and family on the internet. <br><br>
