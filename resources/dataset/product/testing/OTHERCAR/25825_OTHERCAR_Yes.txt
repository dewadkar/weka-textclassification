            (<i>I have decided to update my review of my Jeep Cherokee.  This was my first review on Epinions and I feel that now I am better equipped to write a review to offer more insight to someone interested in this vehicle</i>)

My <b>2000 Jeep Cherokee</b> makes me feel like an adventurer.  Anytime I go off-road, I feel like all I need is an explorer fedora and leather whip and I'm Indiana Jones, on my way to some Incan ruins in the Amazon jungle.  In reality, it&#146s just me pulling up to a campsite on the Mohican river in Ohio, but I can dream right?  Here is my updated review of my <b>2000 Jeep Cherokee</b>.

<b>Look and Style: 6/10</b>
The <b>2000 Jeep Cherokee</b> isn&#146t built for beauty and art.  It&#146s a sport utility vehicle built for a rugged man traveling in rugged terrain under rugged conditions.  It&#146s not meant to be pretty, it&#146s meant to be mean and nasty.  And even if you&#146re not going to be taking any African safaris in the near future, the urban jungle will suit it just fine.  I personally like the sharp corners and &#147boxiness&#148 of the <b>2000 Jeep Cherokee</b> over the more svelte lines of the Grand Cherokee.  It gives it a more masculine feel.  And even though it&#146s nice to keep it clean, it looks much better covered in mud.

<b>Comfort: 7.5/10</b>
I'm a tall guy.  At 6&#146 3.5&#148 I need a lot of room.  I sat in a lot of other, higher priced SUVs but I really felt comfortable in the <b>Jeep</b>.  Headroom is adequate and leg room is sufficient, as well.  I don&#146t like that my right knee bumps into the four-wheel drive shifter periodically, but it&#146s nothing that would stop me from buying another <b>Jeep</b>.  It is a little unwieldy for shorter (an older) people to get in the back seat, but I don&#146t have problem with it, and if you tell me you do, I&#146ll just call you a whiner.  Suck it up, it&#146s a <b>Jeep</b> and it wasn&#146t supposed to pamper your little tushie all the time.

<b>Driving feel and Handling: 8/10</b>
The ride is a little rough around the edges, but this is a SUV so that can be expected. While it doesn't ride like a luxury sedan it doesn't feel like a pickup truck, either. The ride is fairly quiet at highway speeds and is just fine any other time. The <b>Jeep</b> handles well and has adequate response to the driver. The 4.0 6-cylinder isn't a barnburner and the acceleration can feel sluggish at times but for the most part responds well.

Cornering and turning is done with care when you&#146re driving an SUV and with the <b>Jeep</b> things are no different.  You don&#146t go flying around a corner with a <b>Jeep</b> and that&#146s just fine.  It handles just fine when you are driving at normal speeds and there is no fear of roll-over if you take your time.  Handling the <b>Jeep</b> is easy and driving can be fun when done with a little caution.

The fun really begins when you take 'the road less traveled'. Off-road is where Jeeps belong and the <b>Cherokee Sport</b> is no different. Flying though mud is a blast and the Cherokee handles uneven and rocky paths without flinching. The 4-wheel drive is great and you can really feel the power in 4-wheel low.

With all the snow that has fallen this February (2003), it has been nice to have the 4-wheel drive.  Shifting to 4-wheel drive is simple, just pull up on the shifter while you&#146re driving at a normal speed (or completely stopped) and you&#146re good to go.  <b>Jeep</b> suggests you use 4-wheel drive off-road, in wet or icy conditions, or when you want better control over the vehicle.  It does not suggest, however, to use 4-wheel drive in dry road conditions.

Overall, the off-road and 4-wheel drive experience is top notch.  My wife went into labor when the snow starting falling and it was nice to shift my <b>Jeep</b> into 4-wheel and never flinch all the way to the hospital.

<b>Features: 6/10</b>
When it comes to standard features, the <b>Jeep</b> doesn&#146t impress.  It comes with the basic run-of-the-mill standard features.  Chief among them are the 4.0 straight-six cylinder engine (which delivers plenty of power), 5-speed transmission, Steel wheels, and other basics that you would expect from a 21st century car.

Since I purchased my <b>Jeep</b> used I wasn&#146t able to pick and choose any other options, so I have a pretty basic model.  Some of the extras it did come with that I appreciate are the luggage rack, privacy rear windows, keyless entry, and fog lights.  I would like to have (and plan to add when I have some money) the towing/camping package and aluminum wheels.

<b>Safety: 7.5/10</b>
SUV&#146s, <b>Jeep</b> included, have the unfortunate flaw of roll-over.  While this can be avoided with safe and careful driving, the risk still exists.  The <b>2000 Jeep Cherokee</b> has performed adequately in most tests that I have read, so it&#146s a fairly safe vehicle to own.  Anti-lock brakes are not standard on this model but my <b>Jeep</b> has them and I would strongly suggest them to anyone looking to get a <b>Jeep</b>.

Another thing that should be noted is that 4-wheel drive does not equal invincibility.  Just because you can shift into 4-wheel drive doesn&#146t turn you into a world-class rally racer.  Off-roading can be fun and a blast to do but again, common sense and care should be taken.  Sure, the <b>Jeep</b> will go anywhere you want it to, but getting out can be a different story.  So be careful when leaving the paved roads for greener pastures!  (<i>Man, I feel like an old man preaching safety.  I promise I'm not a safety Nazi, I advocate common sense over coercion.  Have fun, just be smart</i>)

<b>Reliability: 8/10</b>
Reliability hasn&#146t been a hallmark of <b>Jeep</b> vehicles, but I have no complaints with my Jeep.  Other than regular maintenance and oil-changes, my <b>Jeep</b> hasn&#146t needed the services of a mechanic.  Since my wife gets the garage, I have to park the <b>Jeep</b> outside, and even in the bitter cold my <b>Jeep</b> never flinches when I turn the key.  It starts up every time, like the champ that it is.

<b>Overall: 7.5/10</b>
I enjoy owning a <b>2000 Jeep Cherokee</b>.  It&#146s a fun truck to drive, gives me a boost to the &#147man-ego&#148 and allows me off-roading fun when I get a chance.  Having said all that, there are a few flaws that I found with the Jeep Cherokee. Number one on my list is fuel economy. I've been getting 15-17 mpg city driving and 19-21 mpg highway. If I could squeeze a few more miles out of each gallon, I don't think I'd have anything really bad to say about this truck.  It&#146s not a luxury SUV (is that an oxymoron?) but it doesn&#146t pretend to be.  It is what it is, a solid vehicle, a big punch balled up in a midsize SUV package.

Unfortunately Jeep has replaced this model this year, so there won't be any new models in the years to come, but hopefully Jeep will bring this truck back.
