            I thought it would be tough. The prospect of going from a snazzy little matchbox Miata to a Honda SUV and still maintaining some semblance of a youthful, San Francisco hipster persona left me a little doubtful. 

When my girlfriend and I set out to buy a new car, we wrote down all of our choices: Jetta (too expensive and small), Nissan X-terra (looks like a tin box), Ford Explorer (too bulky), Toyota Rav-4 (no, no, no), Volvo S70 (just too expensive) we decided that safety and coolness would be our main criteria. After considerable research and a couple of test-drives we concluded that the CR-V was our number one choice and though we were confident it was safe enough, we weren�t sure if it exuded that �look at me� factor. This is where the black tint hip factor comes in. Looking at other CR-Vs, especially the gloomy gray (sans tint), I was wholly unimpressed, but looking at my shiny black LX with tinted windows, alloyed wheels and a nifty rack, I am confident that my hipness is well intact. Note: the author asks you to read hip as a universal feeling, a way we would like to see ourselves.  

Now, onto the nuts and bolts. The CR-V is not a bulky SUV, but it�s big enough to take four people up to Tahoe very comfortably and watch in delight as the poor 2-wheel-drivers fumble with snow-chains. The armrests in the backseat led one of my friends to say, �I feel like I�m in first-class.� I�ve never heard so much talk about a backseat. Unfortunately, the passenger seat does not have an armrest, which somewhat confounds me. Apart from that, and a little lack of that V-6 horsepower (which doesn't really bother me), the CR-V rides smoothly and is actually fun to drive. Let me expand on my definition of the word fun. As snow falls down from the cold night sky, I do not fear the road ahead but sing songs about joy and love and the meaning of hip.
