            When introduced in 1993,Grand Cherokee was the first suv with a driver side air bag. A passenger air bag came along in 1996.The Grand Cherokee comes only in 5 door body and is between a Cherokee and explorer in size. Standard features are four wheel anti-lock brakes that work in both 2 and 4WD,and a 5 speed manual transmission.Base engine is a 190 horsepower 4.0 liter six cylinder.Three four wheel drive systems are available. Part-time command trac was standard dropped after 1995. next they made full-time Selec-Trac switchable between 2 and 4WD.Top v-8's have Quadra-Trac, a permanently engaged 4Wd system.

In 1995, only SE and Limited models were available, and a child safety seat that folds out of the rear seat became optional. Base engine power is adequate but the v-8 is much better.Interior room is okay but spare tire takes up much needed space.This is a very reliable means of transportation and is roomy enough for a family of four or five but not comfy for long trips. It is very well in snow and has decent traction.With 4WD you won't be getting stuck.All- around good car.<br><br>
