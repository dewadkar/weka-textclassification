            This is the perfect general use digital camera.

Unlike other cameras with built in imaging memory - those cameras must be hooked up to your computer to off-load the images, and once the memory is full, you are through with your picture taking venture.  I have found that good high quality images on the regular 1.4 meg diskettes are the perfect answer for quick snap-some-shots and show them around medium.  A typical diskette holds from 19 to 24 images (at 640 x 480 fine resolution), and the images are saved as a standard *.jpg which also means you won't require special software to read the images.

The controls on the camera are very simple to use.

Other features include a macro capability so that you can focus in right up to the lens itself, an mpg feature so that you can actually create an mpg movie saved right on a diskette, zoom features (mine is a 6x zoom with an extended digital zoom feature), and picture effects (sepia, black and white, etc.)

I have experienced no trouble obtaining an extended life battery - which I fully recommend you purchase.  If you are ready with 4 or 5 diskettes in hopes of taking about 100 images, you will be unhappy to learn that the battery cannot make it that long.  Get an extended life battery.

The only drawback I have experienced with the camera is with the image screen.  Your viewfinder is a small digital image screen (tv) that is hard to view in BRIGHT light.  This makes some outdoor shots difficult to position accurately.

All in all, having used three other digital cameras, this one from Sony is by far the most versatile, and for general use, easier to use than many other models currently available.<br><br>
