            Jeep has been making the Jeep Grand Cherokee for many years.  They always have great looking Sports utility vehicles but they are nopt worth the money.  The New Grand Cherokee ride is not as good as other, cheaepr SUVs.  The interior is plush and the sound is good.  I do not think the price is worth 25,000 to 35,000.  The rising fuel costs do not make this a favorable SUV to buy bu now with its powerful V8 engine.  The good thing about the Jeep Grand Cherokee is that its depreciation is great.  You get a lot of money for it when you sell it.  It is a great car for people 30-45. 
Thank You
