            The BMW Z8 really fulfils your need for speed and many desires for a good looking ride.  The Z8 has many great attributes that accompany its sleek body.  It is fully equipped with all of the bells and whistles.  For example, the new Z8 comes in either a beige or black soft top, or a body-colored coupe.  This two door speed demon has all of the safety features that will give you a bit more of comfort while reaching 0-60 in an amazingly swift 4.5 seconds.  Some of these features include:  roll-over protection, side-impact airbags, xenon headlights (which, by the way, will enable oncoming traffic to spot you in even the thickest fog!), and rear fog lights.  This is sure to keep you protected in any accident.

The BMW Z8 is by far one of the fastest BMW street cars.  With a V8 engine that has 294 horses at about 6600 rpms, you are sure not to be agitated by any young hotshots looking for a race.  Even with all of this speed, the Z8 still has some room in the trunk.  With 5 cubic feet to be exact, which isn�t too much, I hope you aren�t going on any family vacations with this car.  

The BMW Z8 also has many great engineering features.  All season traction, dynamic stability control and starter button, vehicle navigation system, a hands-free StarTAC cellular phone, Nappa leather interior, and heated seats are standard luxury services that the Z8 has to offer.  The BMW Z8 also lets you take pleasure in a quiet ride.  Even when driving on a major highway, you will feel like you are in a residential area by the amount of noise heard in this quiet ride.  With a quiet ride and extremely comfortable leather seats, you will be experiencing the nicest ride ever.

All of the features are great about the Z8 except the high price.  It will cost you about $128,000 for this great ride.  If you desire style and speed, this is the car for you, regardless of the price.  Either you have it, or you don�t, this car is not any ordinary car.  BELIEVE ME!, this is the best BMW made yet.  While riding in this car, you will surely make heads turn.
