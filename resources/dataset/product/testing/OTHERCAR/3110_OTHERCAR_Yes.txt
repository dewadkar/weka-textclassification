            The Hyundai Elantra is a testament to Hyundai's dogged determination to prove to the American consumer market that the automaker has left behind its shady past and is moving forward with a redesigned company that produces top quality automobiles.

I purchased an ELantra from Toyota of Nashua in southern New Hampshire.  I bought at the end of the month when quota deadlines loomed ominously over dealer's heads.  I ended buying a Sonata sedan GLS with power, auto, ac, cruise and tilt for under $11,000.  I actually bought the car for $500 under the invoice price.

Owning my Elantra has been a joy.  The car handles crisply and predictably in all weather conditions.  The peppy 130 horsepower 3.2 liter engine provides a significant punch when acceleration is needed to change lanes.  I chose the black exterior which requires constant washing to rid the car of water spots from rain, pollen, and road dust.  When clean, the black looks sleek and stylish and the Elantra becomes a an affordable auto that one's not embarrassed to drive.

The only complaint I have so far with my Elantra is that I'm not getting the gas mileage I expected.  I find myself filling the tank twice a week.  There are two explanations though.  The car may have a small gas tank which is customary for new models of automobiles or it may be due to my excessive use of the air conditioner.

The Hyundai warranty includes 100,000 mi/10 year powertrain, 5 year/ 50,000 mile bumper to bumper, and five year roadside assistance.  This warranty is the industry's best. It looks like I'm going to have to take advantage of that warranty since my heat doesn't work. I'll be sure to update this epinion after having my heat fixed.

Tom Hyundai in Norwood, MA fixed my problem with the heat.  A wire had become disconnected and simply needed to be re-attached. The women who handled my paperwork tried to charge me since an aftermarket radio had been installed installed; however, the manager provided the work for free after I told him that this problem happened prior to the installion.  The car now cranks out the heat of Hades on blustery New England mornings. I am extremely happy with the heat and the overall process of having this repair made.

I would definitely recommend the Elantra to recent college grads who are looking for stylish, affordable and dependable transportation or to any consumer who values these qualities when choosing to purchase a new automobile.<br><br>
