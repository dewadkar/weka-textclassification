                 I bought my car in 1996.  I have had my 1992 Tercel for four years.  It was my first car.  It has been great on gas, and I rarely have had a problem with it.  In fact, it drives smoothly and quietly.  Yet, there is a disappointment to owning this car.  
     Everyone has a wreck at least once in their life.  I have had two minor wrecks.  I feel that in any other car there would not have been as much damaged done.  My last accident occurred while I was going fifteen miles an hour;however, my car has been totaled out.  Not only was my car totaled out, but the car is so small that I felt that I would not have been injured as badly if I had been in a larger car.  
     I feel that Toyota could have done a better job in designing the Tercel.  I recommend this car to those that have somehow managed to avoid having a wreck and are determined to find a way to avoid having one in the future.  Also, I think it would be a great idea to be short if you intend on buying this car, considering it is not made for tall people.
