            I'm an illustrator at a major research laboratory and I need a digital camera for quick turnaround posters, publication images, multimedia presentations, and sometimes just documenting an experiment. I share my camera with a fellow illustrator who came from a traditional photography background. She helped me select the CoolPix 950 based on the features which she would want in a camera. I trusted her judgement and have never been sorry about our choice.

I've had my Nikon CoolPix 950 for about 6 months now and can attest to the quality of images and &quot;ease of use&quot; capabilities. I've used the camera in auto mode under a number of different lighting situations, and have almost always found the images to be very satisfactory. I upgraded the memory to 96 megabytes and have plenty of room for lots of high resolution images. 

One downside would be if you relied on the serial port for downloading images. I found the speed of the transfers to be painfully slow. But this is a problem with transfer rates of the serial bus and not the camera. I use a Microtech PC Card reader which downloads the images very fast (more like copying from a hard drive). I also use a Macintosh Powerbook G3/400 which I can download the files (using a flash card adapter) to my hard drive and immediately display and perform any image corrections at the site. 

If I could wish for one improvement for the 950, I would like to see a Firewire port for quick and easy transfers of images. Currently the only way to battle the fatigue of file transfer is to buy expensive hardware.
