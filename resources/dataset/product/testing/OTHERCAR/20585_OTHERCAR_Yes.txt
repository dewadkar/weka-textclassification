            This review is aimed at European consumers as the car is a diesel. I needed a diesel car because I'm doing around 300 km (200 miles) per day. Europeans know that driving a regular gas car under these circumstances is simply not affordable with gas at more than $1.00 a liter! 

I first considered buying a BMW 320 diesel, but the Audi was a better deal as it came fully loaded for about $3000 less. I got the car in May 2000, so it's still a relatively new toy...

The 1.9 liter engine develops 115 HP with a very good torque equivalent to that of a V6 engine. The car is powerful and I often surprise myself driving it like a sports car. I believe it is the best diesel engine available today.

The mileage is quiet exceptional for this class of vehicle. It averages 6 liters/100 km (40 miles a gallon), and can drop as low as 5.2 liters/100 km if you adopt a more gentle pace.

I bought the Avant model because I think it looks better than the sedan. I don't really need a station wagon although the large cargo area has been useful more than once.

Driving the car is a real pleasure as it handles very good and literally sticks on the road (though it is not a quattro). I would recommend taking the sport suspension which is firmer than the standard one. The air conditioning is powerful and keeps temperature at its best throughout the vehicle.   

The only negative point about this car is the room at the back. Tall people won't be able to push their front seats all the way if there are adults seating in the back.

A very useful option which I thought would have been more of a gadget is the APS (Acoustic Parking System) telling the distance between your rear bumper and the car parked behind you.

I think it's a great car for young families with one or two kids. It is very comfortable for long trips, and handles great in congested urban cities as it is not too big. 

I would'nt say it's the best car on the market as there are no perfect car, but it certainly is the best diesel engine.
