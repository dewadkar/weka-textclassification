            Hello smart person,
You may have read my review of Casio QV-11 digital cam, if so you'll 
remember that I have an extensive background in Photography, and have 
owned many cameras both digital & non-digital. I've shot with Nikons, 
Leicas, Hasselblads and even Artic expedition cameras like the Alpa 9D.
But I have never used an Olympus camera before.( I thought it was just
 too small/light to take clear, hand held photos )
Recently I decided to give a 3.3 megapixel digital camera a try and 
ordered an Olympus C-3000 Digital Zoom camera. 
It offered every feature I wanted and even a bunch I did'nt even think 
of. Now I'm taking short Quicktime Videos w/sound and playing with 
nighttime photography! Take your digital camera and try taking a photo 
of the Moon or a Kite in flight...Or shoot a 1 minute commercial with
sound, with this camera, you can. ( if this review sounds like I love 
this camera, you're right! )
If you are looking for point and shoot, it'll do it. 
Just read the manual and set it up for "auto" everything.
If you understand what "Aperture/Shutter Priority" means, it'll do that 
too. It can be both an easy/fun cam or a serious work cam.
You can adjust everything! and I mean everything.
Has both Optical and Digital zoom. Downloads images quickly with a USB
cable into an adequate though sparse image editing program. 
Only complaints are the very short battery life with normal Alkalines.
This was solved by buying a RayOvac 3 in 1 Battery Recharger and a set 
of 4 Nickel Metal Hydride ( NIMH ) type batteries, total cost for both was 
$22.00 at Wallmart. ( choose any brand as long as they are 1600MAH, 
cheaper batteries may be only 900 to 1200MAH, that's why they are cheaper )
Second Complaint is the 8MB memory card supplied with the camera, I would 
buy at least a 32MB card for it ( I've seen them priced at about 30 bucks,
My next purchase for it ) The 8MB card is fine for "snapshots" But way too
small for hi-res "Photographs" or QT movies. 
And final complaint, Lens cap *must be removed even to download photos.
Forget and you'll hear a grinding motor sound and loud beeping.
What about the pictures? Stunning, is the word that describes it best.
I've printed 640x480-8"x10" photos on decent normal paper with an inexpensive
Lexmark 3200 InkJet printer that my wife has framed, several actually.
Hell they looked so good I ran the printer out of ink!
I was told it was a *very hard to use camera, Yes with all the features 
it has, you *need to read the manual. If you do, you'll be very happy 
with this Camera. Learning curve is much shorter if you've used a 35MM
camera before. Buy it, Learn it, you'll love it. 
This is not a camera for taking small "Ebay" photos, it's so good it 
just may replace your 35mm film camera.
( hey I had to read the manual for my nikon too )
