            A pal of mine bought one of these new in '84. From the first time I saw it I liked the looks. Arguably the best Japanese sport at that time. The standard equipment for 1984 was impressive. 4 wheel disk and independant susp. plus the wider boots, all standard, makes this car a great handler around the mountains. Now throw the fuel injected DOHC 2.8 with 4-11 positrac gearing in the back, all standard, and you now have great handling and some get up and go ! I had a 280Z then and I know my buddy's Supra ate it up both in power and handling, and the 280Z was a great car too! In 99 I had to find a vehicle that could make a 1600 mile round trip at least 3 times a year. I had roughly 2500 to spend ...CANADIAN ! Wanting a 6 cylinder for the highway my thoughts quickly turned to the Older Supras. Surprisingly I found 4 in the area ranging from 82-84 and from 2000-3000 bucks. Found one in decent shape for 2400 and grabbed it. It has all the bells and whistles IE; sunroof,digital dash, etc plus the 5 speed box. I would not recommend the auto tranny in this car, after all...it's a sports car ! It had 164.000 clicks when I bought it in 99. It now has 284.000. The only repairs made ironically came about 2 weeks after I bought it when the ignition module bit it. That was a pricey item at 175 bucks and kind of had me worried. Since then, no issues. It has made the 1600 mile trek at least 20 times in the last 4 years and has performed great every time. I keep her around 80 MPH the whole trip and she loves it ! By the time I pull into town the car is actually running better having been blown out for a while. Although she burns a bit of oil ( 1 quart every 6 weeks ) she shows no signs of slowing down yet. I have started to see these cars in the junk yards as I look for body parts. Rust prevention was NOT a Toyota strong suit at that time and I do need to locate some doors and the infamous hatch back that is definately rusting in the corners, as per the previous reviews. Unfortunately most of these cars are in the junk yard for body issues, not mechanical, so finding good parts is tough. All in all, the car has treated me great. I fully expect to rebuild this baby as far as the body goes. Mechanically, it may well outlast me !
