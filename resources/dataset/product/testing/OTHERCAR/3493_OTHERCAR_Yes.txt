            We bought an Subaru Outback last year because my wife's previous Subaru wagon had proven to be very reliable for 14 years. The previous Subaru wagon was fairly quick, handled well, very affordable, and proved to be fairly low-maintenance: nothing major ever went wrong with it.

So far, the Outback has not disappointed us.  Because of our previous experience with Subaru, we had no problem buying another one.  The Outback is well-crafted, very comfortable, handles better than *ANY* SUV ever conceived, doesn't roll over like SUV's, and has enough cargo space for our day-care business and camping trips.  It also has a very quiet ride and doesn't rattle like my 2000 Ford Contour (see my other review for the story on the Contour). Unlike the older Subaru wagons, the interior has the quiet, solid ride similar to an SUV's (older Subaru were anything but quiet inside).

I highly recommend it.
