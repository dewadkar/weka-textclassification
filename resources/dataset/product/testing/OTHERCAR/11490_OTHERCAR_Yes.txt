            I bought the Chevy Venture in December 2002 to accommodate my children and my own sanity. For anyone who has several children this is a mom's dream! You can separate children on three separate rows (one in front,one in middle and one all the way in the back. Also all 3 children can bring a friend since there are 7 seats! Another Convenience is that you can use the Venture to haul lumber (2x6 or 2x4 or plywood)the Venture is wide enough to haul sheets of plywood without ripping or tearing the carpet. We have driven the Venture on 3 trips over 1500 miles and on numerous trips to the beach which for us is about 200 miles.The Venture far exceeds any expectation that I could of ever dreamed of!!!! The highlights are the cruise control,tv/vcr,stereo system that sounds like the club,very comfortable seating,easy to drive and Very versatile.
The only downfalls are the gas mileage (10-19 miles per gallon)and the keyless entry is not dependable.The keyless entry on our Venture has been unreliable, we have taken our Venture back to the dealer 3 times to have it checked.The only other problem is the carpet is very hard to clean.
