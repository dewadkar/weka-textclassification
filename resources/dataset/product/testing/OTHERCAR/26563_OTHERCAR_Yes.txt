            My husband purchased this vehicle before we were married because his old one broke down wasn't getting back up.  His sister and mom had this car, and therefore he felt that it was reliable and would prove to be quite functional.  Which has been the case.

This car has great pick-up-and-go, and is very reliable.  We haven't experienced one problem with it yet.  Its good on gas, and the ride is pretty comfy.  Although I hate the fact the the clutch is extremely stiff (I'm not sure if it's just this particular car or not), and the seats get uncomfortable on road trips, the inside is well designed for the driver and passenger.

Though designed as a family vehicle, I wouldn't purchase it for that purpose.  Maybe as a secondary car.  But we had to upgrade in vehicles once our daughter was born because we just couldn't fit comfortably in it.  Her seat didn't fit in the back seat very well, and the trunk could barely hold her stroller.  The only thing regarding this aspect is that my husbands year model doesn't have an airbag in the front passenger seat, so we could put her in front.  Other than that, I wouldn't use this as a family vehicle unless my kids were a little older.  It just doesn't work with infants.

Overall its a good car.  No problems to date, and we plan on trading ours in for a newer model.  You can't go wrong with this one.<br><br>
