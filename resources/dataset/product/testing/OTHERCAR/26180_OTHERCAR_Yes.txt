            After owning a toyota 4runner for 10 years now, i feel qualified to write a brief yet accurate review on the machine which has gotten me everywhere from snow covered mountains to the middle of the desert.  

Although underpowered, mine is a 1990 SR5 V6, the 3.0 liter powerplant has a great deal of torque.  It won't take you up a hill at 80 miles per hour, but you can certainly count on getting there...something many cars can't do all the time.  

In 10 years I have had but one problem with my 4Runner.  About 2 years ago the water pump failed and needed to be replaced.  Other than that, the most expensive repair would be a toss up between a new shift knob and a new gas cap!  

Fuel costs are kind of a bummer.  Even after getting the truck tuned up, I still only get about 13 in the city and 15 on the highway.  

hope you enjoy your 4Runner as much as I do mine.  And if you are planning to purchase one, I would highly recommend it.<br><br>
