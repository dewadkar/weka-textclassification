            We purchased a 2001 Mercury Mountaineer Limeted edition, about 9 months ago and Still can�t believe what a great deal we got.  Its a wonderful car for the midsize family who goes on off roading trips, but likes to live life in luxury! It rides great. On the scale of SUV's the Mountaineer is in a lower bracket of the ford branch range, but you get a lot more than you pay. This SUV is one of the best on the market.  No SUV compares to the quality and luxury of  the Mountaineer limited. And dont worry this car looks great too, very stylish, everyone will want to ride in your Mercury. 

We have been very happy with the car. The Mercury Mountaineer comes with anything and everything, there really isnt anything that you cant get on this car that you can on another. The 4WD is excellent especially if you are more of the offroading person or just live in a more winter setting with snow. It has been battle tested on ice and snow where i live so no need to worry. On the new version on the steering wheel you can control just about every feature of the car, there are buttons for the air, radio, cruise control, lights. One of my favorite options on this car has to be the Heated Seats that are of great use during the winter of just whenver you are cold, the heat in the seats gets up in full blast within seconds. The SUV comes with a great 8 speaker BOSE audio system, this system is great for the young kid in all adults. A couple of other features with this car is a 6 cd disc changer and a single cd entrance on the main console, power seats, leather seats which i suggest getting a sunroof.

The first problem is the fact that the optional V8 that we got guzzles gas galore.  It only gets about 12 miles to the gallon in city and about 18 on the highway, so if you don�t want to pay for gas get the standard V6 version.  Other than the fact that it is a gas guzzler I haven�t had that many problems with it.  It you want Ford luxury but want to pay Mercury price than go and buy the Mountaineer Limited and trust me you won�t be sorry.

Overall we have had a good experience in this car and we have been really happy in our decision to purchase this car. If you are in the market for a new one, take it out for a test drive, i think you will be surprised!
