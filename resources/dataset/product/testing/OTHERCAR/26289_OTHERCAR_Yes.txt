            My fiancee, in her infinite wisdom, decided she wanted a new car, and chose a 2000 Pontiac Grand Am. After much thought, she decided to start pricing....
I said, &quot;whoa, wait a minute.&quot; I told her to look around much more after my experiences with Grand Ams (see Pontiac Grand Am review under erconley). I recommended to her that she try out a Honda Civic. Now, a little background here: my fiancee's father is a Chevy mechanic and has had Chevys in the family forever. My fiancee was afraid to buy anything but GM after hearing his comments for 22 years. Soooooo, she admitted that she heard of Civic's record, but shied away. After some thorough convincing and the help of Consumer Reports, we went down to Honda... Well, to make a long story short, she saw several things that sold her: the integrity of the body (no rattles), the room, the options included on the EX, and the resale value after 3 years. Pontiac couldn't match up. Add in the 3000 buck price increase for a base model Grand Am, and a &quot;sold&quot; sticker was on the dash.


We haven't been happier since... glad she listened to me!!!
And, to answer the issue of her father, when she told him that she bought the Honda, he said, &quot;Oh yeah, those are great little cars.&quot; This coming from a Chevy mechanic....


After 6 months of driving, we could not ask for a better car. We have had no trips to the dealer, and have experienced no problems whatsoever (except door ding, which isn't the little car's fault). After a few road trips to San Antonio, we have deduced that this car would be perfect for the young couple starting out (like us), and would be a more-than-reliable addition to anyone's driveway. It feels comforting to not hear one rattle on even the roughest highway pavement. The engine struggles up hills at times, but is more than adequate for a 125-hp 4-banger.


If you are a fan of Consumer Reports, then you will find they love the Civic.  Ever since we started doing the daily drive in the car, we find that the ride is comfortable for a subcompact, and the seats even fit my 6'4&quot; frame.  We have had nothing but good service (typical Honda) and so far have been very impressed.  Plus, we know that when it is time for a trade, the little Honda will hold its weight in resale value.  That's a comforting thought.


Some thoughtful touches:
The anchors for the floormats
Sliding cover for moonroof
Cruise control is simple and located well on steering wheel
Space beneath center dash for drinks, coins, etc.
60/40 split-bench folding back seat

Specifics: Honda Civic 2-dr EX
Power windows, locks, moonroof, remote keyless entry, cd (EX package); forest green with grey interior.  One door ding (dang it!!!)<br><br>
