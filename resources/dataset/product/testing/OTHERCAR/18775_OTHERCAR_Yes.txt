            I was a poor college student. 
I needed an affordable, but some-what reliable car. 
I had terrible experience with Ford Escort during high-school. 
So, Ford was out of option.  
It was either Corolla, Tercel, Civic, Elantra, Sonata, Sephia, and couple of SUVs.  
I wanted a passenger car, so... SUVs are out of list.  
Civic was great, but my sister had Civic, and it looked ugly after few years.  Not to mention it's weak body.  
Toyota seemed to me, was a good choice to go with, 
but every Toyota dealer I went to, salesman was ... jerk!
and called high price.  
So... I own 1997 Kia Sephia GS. 
I think that is the highest model Kia has under Sephia line.  
First thing I noticed was the loud Engine noise.  
Very loud.  
Turning up the stereo kinda helped me to forget the noise. 
Kia is actually better than Hyundai in Korea.  Hack, even Dae Woo is better than Hyundai.  
It is true that Hyundai has high quality luxury car, like Gandure.  
But all Koreans know that is actually Lexus.  Hyundai made a deal with Lexus to sell it's care under name of Hyundai.  
I don't know if they still do that, but at least it started out that way. 

Back to Kia Sephia.  
It's been good to me. 
I have about 40k on my Kia.  
I had to drive it to and from school.  
Windshield wipers aren't very good.  
I tried changing the wiper blades couple of times, but didn't work. 
Engine noise was a big time downside, but I got used to it. 
You must know that I treat my car very well.  
I wash it constantly, I use Mobile-1 for oil change, and I change my oil every 5,000mi.  
I check for fluid every other week.  
I'm scheduled to do tune-up this weekend (my first), and change my breaks at the same time (also, my first). 
My car stereo is great.  
Oh, did you know the Kia CD-player is actually Alpine CD-player?  
It sounds great, even with out extra base equipment.  
A week after I got my Kia, I got my CD-player stolen.  Cost me about $2,500 of insurance money to replace everything back to normal.  Stereo alone cost me over $500.  
Which I think was very very very expensive for such a function-less CDP.  

I had my Auto-Window fuse burned out in the first month I got it.  
Replacing fuse was no problem at all.  
Afterall, I spent over 10k on a piece of metal, what's couple of dollar to make it work?  

I have driven my Sephia up to 120mph? 
My school is about 300miles away from home, and it is very long drive.  
I usually drive it around 75-90mph.  
Once in a while, when there are no cops around, I give it a gas and zzzzooommmm!
It goes over 100mph.  
Kia that I have has gauge upto 125.  
I find, it handles better than Honda Civic.  
I drove civic upto 140mph once.  
it rattled so~ bad when I passed 95mph.  

Gas Tank!
Holds very little.  
I think I filled it 11g when fuel light came on.  At least it has good miles per gallon.  

My engine stopped once.  
I was making a turn, and I had to speed up. 
I guess I must've reach the red spot in RMP.  
But engine stopped, and ...
after about 15min, it start back again.  

Other than what I mentioned, I have no problem wiht my Sephia.  
I think It's great. 
I recommend it to give it a try, take care of it, and it'll treat you right. 
But it's all on you to decide if it's worth the money and time.  
To me, It's above average.
