            Me and my husband just bought a 2000 Chevrolet Cavalier a couple months ago, I just love it!! We bought this vehicle because it was in our price range it was about $13,000!  We also bought this vehicle because it was the most sporty looking 4-door vehicle on the market and in our price range.  I love that it is a vehicle that has about 5 cup holders in it that makes it nice when you are going on long distance trips.  My Cavalier has Cruise Control on it, and a CD player those are my favorite all though all models don't come with that!  This vehicle has a great safety feature for the back doors it has a thing that makes it where you can only open the doors from the outside this feature is very easy to use!
This vehicle has plenty of power to spare, and is great on gas. It is nice to have the extra power when you are trying to pass a slow moving vehicle, and the gas mileage is about 30 miles to the gallon!! To drive this vehicle is great it is very easy to handle has Anti-Lock Brakes!!I would Recommend this car to anyone with a small family it is a great family vehicle!<br><br>
