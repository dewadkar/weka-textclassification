            This is my third Toyota pick-up, and although I don't hate this truck, it's not quite what I expected. My last two Toyota's were totally dependable and never saw the dealer after I bought them. My Tacoma, however, has already been back to the dealer twice and has a few *problems.* 

I had to take the truck to the dealer to get a squeaky throw-out bearing fixed... it sounded like I had a tweety-bird stuck under my truck. The problem seems to come back a few months after it's "fixed." I also had a check-engine light come on recently and the reason why is unclear... the fault code seemed to say that the catalytic converter was going bad, but we reset the computer and the check-engine light has not come-on again since then (knock on wood!) I also have a tendency to miss gears a lot with this truck (making that awful grinding noise!) I'm not sure if it's because the shifter has such a long shift-throw or if the clutch just isn't engaging right. 

I bought the Tacoma because I wanted a reliable vehicle that looks good. I really like how my truck looks, except for the fact that it seems to be "leaning" to the drivers-side... a problem I've found that many Tacoma's have. I think that is the result of having the gas tank on the same side of the truck as the driver, hence the left side of the truck weighs more. The fit-and-finish of the truck is pretty good, except for some sloppy adhesive work on the interior... there is yellow glue on parts of my doors. 

I know this truck is not a sports car, but it handles terribly with the rather large 235 series tires (My truck came with the S-Runner 16" wheels and tires.) The tires look good, but they literally drive the truck because they weigh so much, and the truck has a tendency to bounce sideways on the freeway when I hit a bump... it's kind of scary!!! I put Bilstein shocks on the truck almost immediately and that helped the ride a little, but getting narrower, lighter tires would probably be a good idea. I also invested in some snow tires because there is no way I'd go anywhere in the winter with such a light truck and such wide tires. 

For those of you considering the step-side bed option, beware that the bed is REALLY small. It works okay for me since I just put my kayaks in there and my bikes, but it is really narrow... I probably wouldn't have opted for the step-side if I had to do it again (but I like how it looks.) 

Overall, I do like my truck and so do a lot of other people (it's lowered a little and looks sharp.) I like the color keyed mirrors, bumpers, and grill, and I think the stereo (CD/tape deck) sounds incredibly good for such a cheap vehicle. Fuel economy is okay (high 20 mpg), and other than the above mentioned problems, it's been reliable. I just feel as though Toyota's quality level took a few steps backwards with this truck as compared to my old Toyota pickups. 

One big advantage of getting a Tacoma is that Toyota's TRD department makes a lot of nice goodies for this truck. You can now order stainless exhaust systems, intakes, and even a factory warranted supercharger... not bad if you have a few extra bucks! However, I don't know how you'd ever get any traction with this truck if it was supercharged ;)
