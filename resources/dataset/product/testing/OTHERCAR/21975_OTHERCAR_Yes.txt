            Truck people really have it made these days. There are so many good trucks to choose from. Think back 10 years when the term SUV was barely even relevant if even alive at all. Unfortunately, some of us are not truck lovers (myself included). As long as anyone cares to remember trucks were used to haul bricks and garbage and cement and all kinds of other stuff.  Trucks were work vehicles; tow-trucks, ambulances, logging vehicles and farm implements, no one in their right mind would ever have paid the same price for a truck as for a luxury car (even though they may be loaded with the same gadgets).  

See how far we�ve come?  Today it is not uncommon for a consumer to spend $30,000 - $55,000 on what amounts to little more than a big truck with a bunch of luxury car features thrown in to make you feel like you�re not driving what you�re driving � a truck...

And please no one mention image, anyone who buys an SUV because they want to feel or  look like a big shot is only fooling themselves. Well, not just themselves, SUV owner�s are also fooling the local gas station owner, and the insurance company. Yes they�re fooling them into taking large sums of money each month just for the privilege of driving a big truck.. HA ! Joke�s on them. Show me one person who bought an SUV because they saw it in a music video, or heard it mentioned in a pop song and I�ll show you a sheep, a follower, a complete lemming. And most likely a person who will never use their truck the way it was intended.

That  being said, the Cadillac Escalade is probably the favorite of the �I�ll never take my 4-wheel drive SUV off-road� crowd.  

It�s not Cadillac�s fault. They are simply trying to compete in an increasingly competitive market.  And by the way, let�s be perfectly honest � the old Escalade was nothing more than a Chevy Tahoe with Cadillac emblems glued on it. It really was not a Cadillac.  In fact the old Tahoe (before 2000) wasn�t even all that great, while the current Tahoe is fantastic.

Along comes the 2002 Escalade, even anti-truck folks like myself must admit it�s a pretty fair vehicle when all is said and done. Certainly the Navigator is the Escalade�s closest competition.  But the Navigator isn�t even half the truck the Escalade is.  By comparison to the Escalade, the Navigator feels cheap, very truck-like, bulky, slow, and ill-handling. The Escalade even looks better, but styling is subjective.

Photos don�t do the Escalade justice. The first photo I saw of an Escalade was more than a year ago, I thought it was a joke. However, an up close and personal viewing changed my mind. The front is a little hard to get used to, but the styling does grow on you.  There is a certain elegance to the exterior. Cadillac has done  a great job of trying to distinguish the Escalade from the Tahoe on which it is based. A side view reveals just how close the Escalade and Tahoe really are.

Inside the Escalade is a bit of a disappointment. Yes it is very luxurious, but the GM dash and stereo stand out like a sore thumb on a $50,000+ luxury vehicle. As does the flimsy plastic rear-door strap. Every time an owner goes to close the rear door, he/she will be reminded of this truck�s GM parts bin heritage. Would it have cost THAT much to make that little strap leather?

The gauges are arranged and styled in such a way as to make them more upscale, and to a small  degree it works.  Seats are soft and supportive, heated of course.  Every time I  find something I like about the Escalade, I am reminded of what a great truck the new Tahoe is.  A loaded Tahoe will cost about $42,000. That is a full 10K less than the Escalade.  

Anyway, back to the Caddy.  The Bose stereo sounds quite good, but having heard the Lexus/Mark Levinson system, I am forever ruined for anything other than the absolute best audio system.  The Bose system seems a bit bass heavy, maybe it�s that way on purpose given the intended market for the Escalade. The CD changer is an odd place, but at least it is IN the dash � that  is crucial for a luxury car. 

Speaking of luxury, the Escalade has only a one-touch down switch for the driver side window,  and no one-touch up function for any of the windows.  Less expensive cars such as the Audi A6 have these features. 

Rear seating room is adequate, but not as roomy as one might expect from a full-size truck. Head room is wonderful, it�s only leg room for taller people that suffers. 3rd row seats remove and fold with ease, making the Escalade a breeze to convert from people hauler, to minivan sized cargo carrier.  

Despite the many similarities to the subtler looking Tahoe, the Escalade is definitely more than just a fancy Chevy.  The Tahoe is not available with the Cadillac all-wheel drive system nor the 345 hp, 6.0 liter engine.  That being said, one of the Escalade�s finest qualities is its on-road manners. It is very car like, as is the Tahoe.  Body roll and lean is minimal and handling is excellent, at times even sporty.  All the more amazing when reminded that this is a full size truck.

The 6.0 liter V8 accelerated briskly, but without the neck snapping pull I was expecting.  There is more than enough power in all driving situations, but on paper 345 hp seems like it should result in Corvette like quickness.  The automatic transmission shifts up firmly, but not harshly.  There is a �tow/haul� function on the shift lever that essentially moves the automatic shift points up making it easier to utilize the big V8�s power band.  An unexpected bonus found on the Escalade is the nice exhaust note. So many  V8 cars today have no exhaust sound at all. Lexus, Jaguar and Lincoln all have V8 engines, but you�d never know by listening to the tailpipe. The Escalade�s quiet rumble is reassuring, but never intrusive.  In a world of generic economy and luxury cars, it sure is nice to drive a car where you can hear the results of  choosing a V8.

Overall the Escalade is a very good luxury SUV. It is miles beyond the Navigator, and yet lacks some basic luxury features found on the Mercedes and BMW SUVs.  Although similar to a Chevrolet Tahoe, the Escalade is much more than just a re-badged Chevy.  345 hp and exquisite on-road manners are what sets the Escalade apart.  If you can live with the �rap video� styling (you get used to it) and General Motors interior then you�ll be very happy with the Escalade.

Uh Oh ! I may have spoke too soon. After a visit to the LA Auto Show, and Lincoln's unveiling of the 2003 Navigator to the press, I'm am almost certain the Escalade will not be better than the Navigator. The next Navigator is more luxurious, the interior is more in line with how a luxury vehicle should look, and it is bigger over all with a cleaned up exterior. 

The '03 Navigator will have such amenities as: Power rear door, power split folding rear seat, retractable running boards, and a beautiful brushed aluminum dash with illuminated gauges. Sadly, the next Navigator will have to make do with the same 300 hp engine - a full 45 hp less than the Escalade's.
