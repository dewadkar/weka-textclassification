            When my Crown Victoria LTD caught fire of its own volition in a mall parking lot (but that's it's own story) I was forced to find a new car.  A friend had a grass green 1992 Geo Storm for sale, so I decided I'd buy it... I don't exactly regret the decision, but I have had my share of issues, but overalll I've grown to like it.

<B>Smoothness of Ride: 7.5/10</B>
This car gives a fairly smooth ride for a small car, I was initially impressed, but after a while you begin to feel the bumps, maybe as you would with other cars, but you feel them none the less.  I've never had any real suspension issues though.

<B>Cab Noise: 8.5/10</B>
The ride in this car is fairly quiet, You can easily listen to music or converse.  The exhaust system is suitably muted, so as not to disturb passengers, the only real issue with this is occaisional break squealing, which is more annoying than loud.

<B>Gas Mileage: 7.5/10 </B>
I love the gas mileage on this if I go on a long trip, around town it is only average though.  Around town I'll get in the neighborhood of 19-22, but on a trip of a good length expect to get in the neighborhood of 30-35.  This car has a 9 gallon tank, but only shows 7 of that on the gas guage, this means odds are good you will not run out of gas.

<B>Trouble-Free Factor: 4/10</B>
I've had my share of trouble with this car, spread out from a month after I got it til about a month ago... a total of about 2 years in all.  Two dead alternators, two dead batteries, and lots of repair bill, which are high because it uses foreign parts, but I seem to have it all traced back to a problem in a switch in the steering column, after it was replaced all problems in that area have ceased... now the only remaining issue is squealing breaks... oh well, it's not that bad.

<B>Overall: 7/10</B>
Overall, it gets me where I want to go, and I like the color... everything else is kinda incidental.
