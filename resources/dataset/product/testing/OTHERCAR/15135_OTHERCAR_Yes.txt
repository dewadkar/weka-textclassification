            I bought my '96 Grand Am GT about 5 months ago, my old car had really bitten the dust hard after 3 cross-country moves/trips and several &quot;short&quot; trips (between 400 and 700 miles each) so when it turned 150,000 it was time to look for something else, and the Grand Am came to mind.  I had looked at an older model when I bought my last car, but decided against it (mainly due to some handling issues that I had with it.. but hey, it was an '86...) 
     When I test drove the GA, I knew it was the one for me, something about it just FELT right.  Maybe it was the way it handled, the way it looked or just the raw power that I was not used to having. (I had a Toyota Tercel before I bought the GA, and it was a very reliable car...)
     This time out I wanted to get something that was really fun to drive, and I must say, I was very impressed with this car, and although I don't drive nearly as fast as some other people out there, I do enjoy going fast every now and then (safely, of course) and this car has really delivered.
     As for the comfort:  I have made two cross-country trips, and I drive for a living, and I have not ever been disappointed with it.  I would recommend this car to someone who wants a smooth ride, with enough power to get by, this is the one.
     I also like the fact that (the one I got) has ABS, Electronic Traction system, and dual Air Bags.  All of these make this a very safe, comfortable ride.
     The only thing that I really miss is the gas mileage, which was great on the Toyota..<br><br>
