            I've had my 1999 Lexus RX300 for about 13 months now and it is truly a
great vehicle.  I hesitate to call it an SUV because SUVs are generally
trucks and the RX300 is based on the frame of the Lexus ES300 and it drives and rides just like a well engineered car -- better even with the all-wheel drive.  I believe my insurance carrier classifies the RX300 as a &quot;sport wagon&quot;.

The comfort is great, the drive is amazing, and it looks just stunning.
The 2000 model appears to have a different spoiler option that the 1999.

The rear seat is adjustable front or back by a few inches which helps with the cargo area.

There are only a few cons I would have about the RX300, but it's more to do with my own circumstances.  When we bought it, we only had one child and so a single child seat in the center of the back-seat left plenty of room for two full size adults on either side.  Now we have two children and two child seats, one on each side of the car.  This is fine for when it's just the four of us, but while a fifth person can squeeze in between the child seats, it isn't exactly comfortable.

I would like to see the following in this car: 

- Built in child seats (so you can fold and retract when you don't have
  the kids with you).
- Navigation system or some kind of On-Star type system.
- A little more cargo space.

However, all in all, I love this car and plan to keep it for quite a while.
