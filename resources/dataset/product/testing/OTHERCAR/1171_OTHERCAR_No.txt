            This is an age old question.  Most guys know what i am talking about.  You want cause it looks good but then you look at the upkeep and, well, you'd rather be alone.  

   When you look at the New Neon you don't expect to spend more time taking it to the dealership for repairs rather then driving it.  I love my car, but i am tired of all the problems.  I special ordered my car with all the options except a sunroof.  Why don't the rear windows have power like the front windows do?  I think this is really Bazaar, i don't think that i am the only one. 
  
    I have taken my Neon to the dealership for problems about 15 time (no joke).  The brakes have had to be adjusted 6 times!!  I have only had this car 4 months.  
I was involved in a rear end accident also.  Sometimes i wonder if this car is just a bad luck magnet.  

   So far my A/C has ceased to work, and because i live on the island of Guam this is more then a small inconvienence.  My front tire exploded two days after i drove it off the lot.  A new 15 inch Good Year LS tire is 113 dollars.  I have had 4 recalls on various aspects of my Neon.  

  Well tomorrow i have to take the Neon to the dealer again have the brakes looked at.  When are my problems going to end??

   Oh, the car got through the rear-ender pretty good.  I only received about 4000.00 worth of damage and the guy hit me at 45 MPH.  I have side air bags and they didn't seem to do much.  So if your planning on ordering a Neon with side air bads i wouldn't be worried about it.  Save yourself some money, don't bother with that option.  ABS is a good option to get.  Goo luck with your Neon!
