            My wife had a Saturn SC about a year ago and I absolutely hated it.  I didn't like the looks of it and I really didn't like driving it.  Here are the bad points in my epinion:

<b>1.</b>  It is entirely too small.  The car my wife drove had a power sunroof in it.  I realize that this takes some of the head room away, but this was ridiculous.  When I sat in the car, my head hit the roof and I'm only around 6 feet tall.
<b>2.</b>  It was made cheaply.  Yes, it is an inexpensive car, but I feel that Saturn cut a few too many corners on this car.  The one we had was basically fully loaded.  It had leather, power everything, etc.  The problem I had with it was that many of the parts were cheap.  There were many plastic parts that for a few dollars more could have been made of steel.
<b>3.</b>  I didn't like the appearance.  This is a personal thing, but I just didn't like the way the car looked.
<b>4.</b>  My insurance called this a sports car.  I own a Mustang GT and it is not considered a sports car on my insurance.  If a Mustang GT with a 302 is not a sports car, how is a little Saturn with a 4 cylinder considered a sports car?

So, here are the bad things that I could find with this car.  

To give the other side of the story, my wife loved it.  She is very short and it just fit her.  She liked the way it drove and almost everything about it, I just had to disagree with her.  We finally got a different car when we found out she was pregnant.  It's a good thing too, because it ended up being twins.

I would recommend this car to someone who is small in frame and who doesn't mind having a ugly car that is made cheaply and is willing to pay too much for insurance.

I would not recommend this car to someone who is taller than 5 feet 9 inches tall.  I also would not recommend this car to someone who wants a well-made car that he/she can drive for a number of years.
