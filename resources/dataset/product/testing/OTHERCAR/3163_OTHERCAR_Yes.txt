            My poor cute little Honda is being neglected for a prettier, faster, greener mode of transport.  My husband betrayed our Accord with a '95 T-top Camaro, 6-cylinder.  But he is loving it!  I love it too, when I get to actually ride in it.  

I used to have the cleanest car in town, and I never had to lift a finger because my hubby was out every weekend washing, waxing, vacuuming.  Now I have the trash mobile!  Don't get me wrong, it looks good from the outside, but my daughter and I tend to leave McDonalds bags in it, empty latte cups, and whatever else we tend to &quot;forget&quot; to bring in the house.  Now we have the cleanest sports car in town.

From what I have read and heard, the Camaro was rated one of the safest cars in its class.  And to agree with this, it is a very solid feeling piece of machinery, has dual airbags, and anti-lock brakes.  It is smooth and comfortable if you are in the driver's seat.


However, you sit very low to the ground, which can be a pain getting in and out. And on the passenger side of the car, there is a large hump under your legs, which on long trips gets uncomfortable.  The back seats are more comfy than I thought they would be.  They are deep and hug you.

The trunk space could be somewhat of a problem if you have to pack anything more than 5 bags of groceries in it, or a medium sized suitcase.  But then, isn't that what we have the Accord for, trunk space?  Ha...

So far, this car has performed well, and I can't wait for summer so we can test out the T-top...except what do I do with my hair....????<br><br>
