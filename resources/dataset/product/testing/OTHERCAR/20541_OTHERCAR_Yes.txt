            I am not going to pretend to be a gear head or a techie and quote a lot of numbers that I don't know but could look up, just give a regular driver's impression of the car.  I bought my '99 Integra in August, after hunting in vain for a used stickshift Prelude but being pleasantly surprised to find out that I could afford a new Integra.  I got the green LS coupe, mainly because I am anti-leather and couldn't wait an extra week to have the dealer switch out seats on a new GSR with one of the 98s on the lot that had cloth seats.

After driving an '82 Volvo for two years, the first thing that impressed me while test driving was how (dangerously) quiet the car was by comparison.  In the Integra I can have a conversation at 70 miles an hour without having to yell.  Of course, I now have to use the cruise control to make sure that I don't drift up to ticketing speeds unawares.  It provides a very smooth ride and handles well.  I'm not much for trying to beat something with a huge engine off the line but have no trouble in general with acceleration.

This car gets excellent gas mileage; I have gotten as much as 36 miles to the gallon on one trip to Maryland.  Lately it has been averaging about 27 miles a gallon with mostly in town driving.

When we had a two foot snowstorm this summer, I was able to get my car out with a little bit of digging and successfully, albeit carefully, navigated the icy and slushy roads with little problem.  I saw people with trucks who couldn't get out or were afraid to try it, but I drove my trusty Integra with utmost confidence that we would get back in one piece.

I added a moonroof visor this summer which was well worth the $120 it cost.  It has cut down tremendously on the heat and glare which made the moonroof almost unusable in the North Carolina noon.

Several of my friends have driven my car, including many who are not used to driving manual transmissions, and they have remarked on how smooth the transmission is and easy to drive.  

The car has now been in the shop under warranty several times; I have had the wiper motor, antenna motor, horn, CD player, and a speaker replaced.  The horn is still kind of wimpy and I imagine that I will replace it with something a bit more powerful, but every time that the car has been in the shop, the dealership has been excellent about obtaining a loaner for me (a CL one time!  Fun!) and extending the loaner as long as needed to get parts in.  Performance Acura in Chapel Hill is great!!

The things that I don't like about my car are minor annoyances.  If the windows are misty and you roll them down and back up, they are still misty (every other car I have had has had something on  the outside of the windows that wiped them when they went down) so I do a lot of driving with my window open and my head hanging out in the mornings.  The cupholder being in front of the CD player is a bit of a nuisance when trying to navigate the radio.  The backseat is somewhat small, but I never ride back there so it doesn't bother me personally (and saves me having to be the driver sometimes.)  It would be nice to have a hatch release in the car.  I wish that the trim along the doors were rubber after my stupid neighbor dinged my door.  And if I'm not careful parking, the low front end scrapes the curb.

The car looks great from the outside, low and sexy, is fun to drive, and comes standard with Cd player, sunroof, and power windows and locks.  So be careful not to drive into a lake and short those windows out because you might not be able to get them down to escape!  The number I do know is that it has 140 horsepower and about a 13 gallon gas tank which is a bit small but with such good gas mileage you won't notice that much.  And it makes it cheaper to fill up.  The gas warning light is a nice feature as well, to grab your attention when low on fuel.  (No, I am really not used to such amenities after the Volvo!!)  The hatch light is tremendously useful although if the trunk is too full it won't help being on the side of the trunck.  The seats fold down for back seat access to the trunk.  Unfortunately, this means the valet key only keeps people out of the glove box - again, a minor issue.  

I would heartily recommend the Integra to anyone looking for a reasonably priced sporty car.<br><br>
