            I have been extremely happy with my Canon PowerShot S40.  When I purchased the camera in 2002, I was deciding between that and the PowerShot G2, which was also one of the top rated cameras at the time.  In the end, I decided on the S40 because I felt that the convenience and comfort of the S40's small size outweighed the G2's greater feature set but bulkier frame.  While I admit the S40 and G2 are somewhat out of date by today's standards, I think this tradeoff is still a fundamental one that casual (but somewhat experienced) photographers like myself will find themselves debating about.

Let me go through some of the features I love and hate the most to give you more of a sense of this camera:

As a point-and-shoot camera, this is an excellent choice.  If I ask someone to take a photo for me, he/she rarely has any trouble using it and the photos invariably turn out well.  The zoom is located in a convenient place on the top left edge (look toward the front of the camera) with a metal piece that slides left to zoom out and right to zoom in.  There is a wheel for selecting the mode, and to be honest, while I've become familiar with most of the extra settings, some of the most advanced ones I almost never use out of convenience.  Most of the time I leave it on "Auto" and that works fine.  The camera is designed well for even holding with one hand (at least for right-handers), and I can get clear shots even if I don't have both hands free.

One area of annoyance is the flash.  Although it's small, it tends to really affect the light-balance of the pictures in an unrealistic way, especially by white-washing most things in the foreground.  As a result, unless I'm taking a portrait where I care more about seeing what's in the foreground rather than accurate lighting, I will often turn the flash off.  Unfortunately it doesn't remember this selection, so I often have to waste time changing the flash settings each time I turn on the camera.

I'm very happy with the LCD, though it does tend to drain battery life.  It's about 1" by 1.5" and is very sharp and realistic.  However, if you use it for all your photos, you will probably only be able to take 25-30 photos before you need to recharge the battery.  As a result, if I know I will be taking lots of photos, I will often turn off the display and use the optical viewfinder.

The problem with the optical viewfinder is that it's inaccurate.  If you compare what it displays with what you actually get in the picture, the actual picture will have a fair bit more content around the edge, often unwanted scenery.

Sometimes I have trouble taking photos that aren't at least a little bit blurry with the S40.  It's especially difficult in low-light conditions if I have the flash off, but this is understandable because it needs to lengthen the exposure to compensate.  I understand this is an issue with many digital cameras.

My last complaint is that (at least when I bought it), Canon wasn't selling or recommending any decent camera case.  As a result, I wound up searching for a real case that fit the camera for a long time, and eventually, a few months later in Japan, I found a Sony Cybershot case that fit it well.

The rest of the camera's characteristics I've been very happy with.  The menus are very intuitive.  Uploading the photos to the computer is easy and I really like the software it comes with.  The buttons are easy to push and easily distinguished.  Probably most important of all, the picture quality is outstanding and resolution (at 4 megapixels) is more than enough for my needs; in fact, I rarely use anywhere near that high a resolution when on vacation.  The 3X optical zoom is excellent and goes up to 11X including the digital zoom (though this will often generate more grainy pictures).  The S40 uses CompactFlash cards, which are ubiquitous and cheap.  And the battery is easily charged in under an hour (though doesn't last quite as long as I would hope).

Overall, I highly recommend this camera, and believe that a lot of the new cameras available today are overkill, when you can get this near-perfect camera at a veritable bargain in today's market.  The photos are great and you'll have fun taking them, regardless of your experience with digital cameras.
