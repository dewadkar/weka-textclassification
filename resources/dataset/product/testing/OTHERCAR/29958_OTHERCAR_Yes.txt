            My sister and I trade with and borrow from each other.  I have enjoyed her caravan.  It has room for six children, and they can be far enough apart to not pick at one another.  There is also room for a lot of luggage or other cargo.  The seats are much easier to remove than the seats in my Chevy Astro.  The driver side door makes getting everyone in and out so easy, and much quicker.  

The Caravan is easy to handle.  It is low enough to the ground to corner good, but is also high enough to give you a clear field of vision. I recommend Dodge Caravan for people that need a lot room for kids.  It is an especially great vehicle for families with small children.l<br><br>
