            I just recently acquired this car from my husband's lot and let me first start by saying RCC stocks anywhere from 50-75 cars daily and I have been involved with this car store for nearly five years and "Ling" is the first car I have ever seen there that actually made my jaw drop.  She's midnight black, the LS model so she has all the equipment Mits has made famous and best of all she has only 73,862 miles!  All this for such little cash you say??  What's wrong??  What's wrong is Mits hasn't figured out a way to keep their cars from depreciating to nothing within two years.  There is very little wrong with this car (minor adjustments do need to be made and will be addressed later in this review.  

In the week I have had her, Ling and I have been on road trips daily.  My husband and I live 45 miles from where we work and Ling has made a wonderful addition to the commuting "trio" comprised of a full-sized Ram 1500 pickup, an Isuzu I-Mark and now this beautiful black Beemer knock off.  All you BMW guys out there don't get your boxers in a wad.  I have all the stuff both under the hood and in the cockpit that says I can scrap with you.  I have a 240hp DOHC V6, 4-wheel anti-lock brakes with a very nice shifting 4 speed automatic transmission. Inside I have ECS ride control, AM/FM CD-Cassette, dual climate control, ice cold air (necessary with midnight black paint), dual power seats, leather that would rival the softness of a baby's behind, and a suspension system that let's me double suggested curve speed limit signs while buffing my nails but alas, you do have something I don't; I don't have Euro mechanic bills and high insurance premiums. 

This car is very quiet on the freeway unless of course the moonroof is wide open and all the windows are down. Economy is great on the highway, she's pulls almost 28MPG (would probably do a lot better if I could keep my foot off the floor).  Cruise control is very easy to operate but I seem to forget how occasionally; again, the foot buried in the floor problem! Ha ha.  Most of the controls in this car feel good and are user friendly, easy to find and right at your fingertips but it's easy to get lost because there are so many.  Familiarize yourself prior to driving.  You could have an accident. More on performance; The 4 speed automatic transmission shifts smoothly even at hard acceleration and has a mode shifter between economy and power.  I see little difference both in mileage and shifting. Personally I think Mits did this just to fool us into thinking this car does something it really doesn't, the button's just fluff although the power and eco indicators in the dash are colored differently!  Red for power; green for economy.  C'mon guys were not really that stupid.  

I don't think I mentioned rear seat space!  Crampy if your over six feet and sport a 36" inseam or better but if the driver and passenger up front are shorter, it's not so bad.  Kids seem to get in and out ok but adults have a little tougher time again if they're tall.  You can strap three children into the backseat and they fit nicely.  Three adults (in theory) too but I think if they're full size they'll be cranky when they get out.

Since this is not a small car it has a massive trunk!  Plenty of room to store lots of luggage or in my case real estate signs, briefcases, lockboxes and yes, ladies and gentlemen, a real-life full size spare!  No donuts here!

On the down side, these terrific brakes need rotor turning, otherwise the right front drags intermittently.  The climate control is wonderful unless you spin the control wheel too fast and it runs home to mama.  Aside from these minor little glitches, this car is a dream and for under $10,000!  

The folks that had this jewel before I did obviously had not been introduced to leather cleaner or a vacuum but since her addition to my "family", Ling has met both and gleams with pride.  This is a terrific car and a blast to drive.

Update:  6/5/03:  Yes, it does seem that some things are too good to be true.  You BMW guys I kind of insulted in the first paragraph can now chuckle; I have your Euro mechanic bills.  Although CARFAX told me that my timing belt had been replaced at roughly 59,000 miles, I went out some three weeks ago, turned the key and to my dismay (horror, actually) I heard only the lower end of my engine turning. I turned it off right away thinking oh, poop (not my exact words) the timing belt broke.  To make a long story short although it is somewhat humorous at times, I took her to the Honda/Mazda/Nissan dealership close to where I live, because they have an ex-Mits tech on staff. When they pulled all of the stuff off to replace the timing belt they found the belt intact and all the timing marks dead on.  Confused to say the least, they did a compression test.  Only two of the six cylinders were up.  They dug deeper into the engine compartment, pulled both heads and discovered severe pitting on both.  They're being resurfaced as we speak and four out of the six valves were burnt. While they boil, I'm computing about $1800 in repair costs before I can get her back.  Crow is best served warm and while I'm not enjoying this particular meal, I'm also not hypocritical enough to not inform you unsuspecting buyers out there.  If it looks good, sounds good, don't believe it; take it to your mechanic, have it thoroughly examined before committing to buying it.  But I do still love Ling and I'm not selling her once she's fixed. My karma isn't bad enough to warrant anything like this happening again.  Besides, it's not the car's fault, it's just some design flaw.  This is probably why Mits discontinued the 3.0L and went to the 3.5L SOHC. A positive side; experiences like this let you meet new and interesting people who actually aren't feigning concern while they take your money.  I'm on a first name basis with every one at the dealership that's fixing Ling. I've been granted daily visitation while she's with them and I hope, no I pray that this is the end of the costly repairs.  I'll keep all of you informed...Later.
06/26/03:  Newest update!  I picked Ling up from the dealership last Thursday and actually paid less ($1487) than everyone there had originally thought.  Since I've had her back, she's performed flawlessly.  Her gas mileage has significantly improved (36 hwy) and yes, she is just as beautiful and I am just as in love.  I took my clients out to dinner in this car and the gentleman half of my party couldn't stop closing the door.  He was fascinated with how solid and quiet the action was.  Horizon Honda /Mazda /Nissan gave me a courtesy re-inspect with an oil change free of charge after 500 miles (3 days later, I just couldn't stop driving this car!)and everything checked out.  She's resting today at home but trust me, tomorrow, since I have the day off, she and I are going to rediscover each other.
