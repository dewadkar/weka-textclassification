            What can I say?  I loved this little truck.  I paid $1900 cash for it in 1998, drove it for a year, and sold it for $3500.  

Let me first point out that the only reason I sold this truck is because I had another vehicle I liked a little better.  If you're wondering, it had an A/C that worked, a V6, Luxury package, etc.  It was an older car, but I loved it.  If I wasn't given this car, I would have kept this truck.

Onto the truck:

I bought the truck with 104,000 miles on it.  The right mirror was broken, the rear "bumper" had been replaced with a homemade wooden bumper/hitch combo, the A/C didn't work, it was dirty and had some scratches.  Mechanically the truck ran great.  The truck wasn't garage kept.  The body had no rust, just some normal scratches a truck of 100k+ miles accumulates in 4 years. 

Rusting apart below--  
I thought the truck sounded a little loud and rattle-ly when I drove it.  The exhaust was rusted but okay.  However, the exhaust mounts were rusted off and replaced by the original owner with coat hangers.  I tightened the hangers and left them.  They held up for the year I owned the truck.  

Gas Tank�
This is what angered me the most.  The gas tank on this truck had a loosely fitting black plastic cover covering the front half of the tank.  Over the years rocks, grass, dirt, weeds and other grimey-stuff accumulated between the plastic cover and the gas tank.  The rotting material and dirt would hold moisture for a long time after a wet-drive.  This slowly caused the gas tank to rust.  One day I noticed I was losing gas when parked.  The leak got bigger to the point I could see the drips.  I got another gas tank in a junk yard and it took me 7 hours to install it.  I didn�t put the plastic cover back on the tank.  I believe this was an engineering fault from GM, but it was way past the warranty period when this occurred.  

Bumper�
The bumper on my truck wasn�t really a bumper.  It was a roll-pan.  What is a roll pan?  It�s a flush mounted panel that is vertically aligned with the tailgate.  So basically the rear-end of the truck was flush up and down, no bumper, no protection.  You could purchase a real S10 bumper as an option, but I just stuck with the homemade bumper the original owner added to the truck.  It worked and it gave me a frame-mounted hitch.

Power�
I had the 2.2 Liter I-4 Cylinder 5 Speed Version of this truck and let me say IT WASN�T DESIGNED FOR POWER!  Most car/truck manufacturers don�t build vehicles with 4 cylinder engine for power, they build them for ECONOMY!  Maybe someday people will realize that and take those noisy tailpipes off of all those 4-cylinder engine vehicles.  I�ve filled the bed of the truck with computers, wood, furniture, and everything else in between and never had a problem, even in the hilly land of WV.  Take offs weren�t fast, but the truck got up to speed; passing power wasn�t that of a NASCAR, but it managed; driving up steep hills wasn�t easy, but it always made it�Typical ECONOMIC vehicle.

Mileage--  
Since I have established this vehicle is an economy vehicle, let me tell you about the mileage I got.  In the city or around town I got around 26-27 miles per gallon.  If I dropped the tailgate I got almost 30.  On the highway, this is the kicker, I got 33 miles per gallon, 35 with the tailgate down.  I ran mid-grade gas (89 Octane) in the truck because it made the truck run quieter, it seemed to cause less rattle and less vibration�especially on the exhaust system.  And remember, I got those mileage figures consistently with over 100k miles on the truck.

Towing�
I did some light towing with this truck, some jet ski�s and a trailer with a couple four-wheelers on it (one time with 2 on the trailer and one in the bed).  The truck managed to make it wherever I took it.  Hills were never a problem, although the engine did get a little hot and it went a little slow.  Most of the time when I towed anything I had to drive it in 4th gear, 3rd on steep highway hills.

Maintenance, reliability�
I changed the oil every 3,000 miles.  The truck never burned or leaked any oil.  I never had any parts fail other then the A/C, gas tank, and rear struts.  I put new brake pads, rotors and drums on the truck when I got it and never had to change them again.  None of the usual parts like the alternator, cooling fan, or electronics ever needed replacement.  This truck was very reliable, unlike my car I replaced it with, this vehicle never left me stranded, not once.

Safety�
I tipped the truck over on its side one time on an icy mountain road.  The seatbelts held, the truck didn�t buckle, I didn�t even have a scratch�but the truck did.  The truck had no airbags but it did have crumple zones and headrests to keep your head from bashing the back window.  If you hit something hard enough head on the engine would fall out to keep from being smashed into the cab.

Interior Space--
These last two topics I saved for last for a reason�  They were the best reasons to own this truck (besides the reliability).  For a small lightweight truck, it had tons of room inside.  I could fit myself and two of my buddies in the cab comfortably and did so all the time.  The shifter never hit any knees, the steering wheel didn�t smash into my chest, and we were never squeezed against the doors.  I should also add that I�m a pretty big guy and so were my friends.  I was going to buy a new S10 in 2000 but I chose not to due to the small interior space�that was the sole reason I didn�t buy a new one.   This truck had twice as much room and comfort.  When I test drove the new one, my girlfriend and I were scrunched and we were the only two in the truck.  Three would have never fit.  So if you want space in an S10, I recommend the 94 model year truck, they just don�t make them like they used too.  

Mud and More Space--
The glove box was decently sized and I had plenty of room behind the seat for an organizer with tons of tools and emergency gear.  I had a 100% bench seat which had two cup holders attached to the seat in the center.  I later added a large organizer to the middle (which was easily removed) to serve CD storage and as an armrest.  The floors were all plastic or vinyl.  I took the truck out in the mud many times and hardly ever got stuck.  When I did get stuck the truck was light enough for another vehicle to pull or for your buddies to push.  You could take the bench seat out with four bolts and spray out the inside floors with a water hose to remove the mud�this was nice, no carpet ;-)

Insurance�
What else besides safety, price, and reliability do people look for when they are buying a vehicle, especially if you are a young person?  Insurance!  I was 16 when I owned this truck.  I paid $33 a month liability insurance on this truck.  Compare this to me being 19 with a 2000 model vehicle paying $140 full coverage per month.  Or $66 liability for an 88 Oldsmobile.  Very economical (Doesn�t this seem to be the theme?).

Overall�
I definitely recommend this truck.  I drove it for almost 50,000 miles and someone was willing to buy the vehicle for $3500 with 149,000 miles on it.  The truck proved to be very dependable, sturdy, and economical.  I got great mileage and had a ton of fun.  My only complaints were that the air conditioner never worked, the gas tank cover, and there wasn�t a tachometer.  And for you speed demons out there, the truck has a governor that shuts off the gas flow at 94mph and yes the truck could get up to 94mph, it took a little while, but it would do it.  

If I had to describe the truck in two words they would be Economical and Dependable.  If you come across this truck for a good price it may be worth the investment, even if you just want to use it for a highway vehicle or a toy.  It�s very easy to work on.

As always, I try my best to be objective and honest with my reviews.  Please rate my review honestly and if you have any comments, please feel free to leave them using the comment options.  Happy Reading  -J

PS  As I was choosing the review details at the end, one of the options for the seat comfort is "Excellent, could live in them."  I actually did live in them camping and partying a few times.  I slept comfortable in the seat by myself or with a friend against the window with a pillow or two.  It was nice.
