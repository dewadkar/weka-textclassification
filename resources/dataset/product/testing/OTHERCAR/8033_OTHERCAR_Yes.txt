            I hate going to car dealerships. I hate salesmen (and women!) who assume since I'm female, I (a) can't finance this car without my husband with me. (b) talk over me to my husband because I probably won't understand the &quot;fine&quot; points and (c) assume I can't drive a stick.

After weeks of getting upset over rude salespeople, we went to Saturn and told them I wanted a car. It was amazing!  The salesman talked TO ME!!!  He asked whether I wanted a manual or an automatic and what my price range was.  We bought a 1992 Saturn SL1. This was 1995. To this day any time I go back in they remember me and what car I bought, which is impressive because I've only had 2 repairs done since I bought the car.

I now have 141,000 miles on this car and will not even consider another car until this one dies, and from the way things are going that won't happen anytime soon.  I love the comfort and power of the car it is easy to drive, smooth and quiet.  But the best part is the low maintenance. Very very rarely does anything ever go wrong.  My altenator went out and some clips broke on the moulding.  What makes this car such a pleasure and so valuable is the excellent salespeople at Saturn. I refuse to buy a car anywhere else.  Saturns' kind of personal, caring service got me to buy the car, the car made me a loyal Saturn owner forever.<br><br>
