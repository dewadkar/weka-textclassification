            This is a fun camera to use. The best part is that you get instant gratification by viewing the pictures right after you have taken them. It is also great not to pay for film developing and you can email them to your friends.

The camera also came with all the editing software to use on the photos.

The negatives are that it was not so easy to set up, you need to have special requirements - it only works on one of my laptops and could not be set up on our pc. So be sure to check the requirements prior to purchase.

Also, it requires a very steady hand, any shake and the pictures come out too blurry. 

All in all, for the price. It is by all means a fun toy to impress your guests with.<br><br>
