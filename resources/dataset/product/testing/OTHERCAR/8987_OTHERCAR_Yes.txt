            My wife and I went shopping a car to replace her excellent 1997 Ford Taurus that has 125,000 miles on it.  We were looking at Intrepids, Taurus', Accords and Camreys when a stylish looking vehicle we'd never even been in caught our attention.  It was a Pearl White Hyundai Sonata with a V-6 engine and 170 horsepower.

We test drove the vehicle for several miles and have the following observations:

1.  Maneuverable.  The car handles turns and U-Turns very well.  In traffic it is responsive and it has excellent visibility even with tented windows.

2.  Good acceleration.  I would have said great acceleration but there is a slight delay from the moment you touch the gas pedal until the car takes off quite impressively.  I believe this is due to a transmission problem that is not too severe but could be a problem on a busy freeway entrance ramp.

3.  Comfort.  The seats are firm but not too hard.  In the front seat, I had no problem with legroom or headroom even though I'm 6'3".  The air conditioning system is excellent as is the heater.  The back seat is not comfortable for tall people.  There is insufficient leg and head room.

4.  Style.  The car is very stylish especially for the price.  It is a compact car but seems to have more room than the average compact.  Its looks easily rival the more expensive Camrey and Accord (and I love my Accord).

5.  Miscellaneous.  The Sonata comes standard with dual front and side airbags.  The trunk space is generous although it has one of those stupid donut spares.  The sound system is excellent but does not come standard with a CD.  The interior storage space is adequate but has very small cupholders which are very inconvenient for the driver.

6.  Warranty.  The Sonata has an excellent warranty.  It has a 10 year, 100,000 mile Powertrain Protection.  It also has a 5 year, 60,000 Bumper to Bumper warranty; also, a 5 year unlimited miles 24 hour roadside assistance program.

In all, we were very impressed with the car.  The Sonata we looked at was not quite "loaded" but it carried a price of around $17,500.  We haven't decided yet whether we'll buy it but it is in the running.
