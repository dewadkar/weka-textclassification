            I have to be honest with you - perhaps I'm biased, but I've always been a Mercedes girl.  From my dad's first 240D to his 380 SL, I was in heaven!

He's just turned in his SUV and was on the prowl for something fun, fast and preferably a convertible.  We looked at everything from a Porsche Boxter, Audi's, BMW's, Saabs and beyond.  As a last resort, dad headed out to the Mercedes dealer.  Though he'd always been in love with Mercedes, he didn't think this car was the answer.

To say that joy shone from his face the first time he drove it was an understatement!  He had found his nirvana!

It came in the form of a silver 2001 Mercedes SLK380.

I had been with him in his vehicle pursuit.  We'd tried everything.  I found the Boxter fun, but we lost out on that one.  I thought the BMW's were very disappointing.  We tried a 6 speed and an automatic and both lacked any of the power or pizazz I had expected.  The Saab's were nice, but a little too family oriented.  This Mercedes was the first two-seater I had actually found COMFY!  The seats hug your back no matter what size you may be.  There is an amazing amount of leg room (I'm 5'10") which is always a requirement in any car I either drive or sit as a passenger.

The controls were a little hard to decipher at first passing glance, but the little flip chart they provide with the car answers any and all questions.

I find it interesting that they sell the CD Changer as an option.  And of course the car can only have the Mercedes changer...  Nothing like protecting their interests.  But the addition of the changer was a good choice.

The hardtop is a great thing.  The prior 380SL we owned had the detachable hardtop which was, to say the least, cumbersome and difficult to store.  The hardtop provides great durability (no replacing the top on this car!) and gives a sleeker line than some other convertibles in it's class.

An amazing option that I had never heard of before was the automatic transmission that could also be driven as a 5 speed!  I'm not any sort of expert on cars, so pardon me while I still wipe the look of "Wow!  I didn't know they could do that" off my face.  It's a nice option as you can choose the kind of drive you want.

I found the drive solid and stable.  It hugged the curves and flew down any straightaways.  

The only few drawbacks are as follow:

1.  When the top is down, you can almost completely forget about the trunk.  

Sure, you could fit a few bags in there, but don't expect to throw the top down while on a cross-country journey.  Unless, of course, you pack light!

2.  The netting behind the drivers head can cause some sight impairment while backing up with the top down.  And it's a pain to take it off and put it back on later.  

Overall for the price-tag, I found this car to be the best value in it's class.  It's sporty, it's elegant and it's classy!  Plus it comes with a great warranty and gets decent mileage.
