            I bought this camera when it went on sale at our local KMart. We had talked about a digital camera for awhile since I had been scanning our photos and printing them. It made sense to go the direct route to the printer. I wanted a camera that wasn't too expensive but would give me good quality snapshots. I wasn't looking for a portrait camera or anything approaching professional use. Just wanted a convenient way to take snapshots of family events. 

This being the first digital camera I had ever used, I had a few surprises. The first one was the confusion about when to snap the picture. This camera requires considerable time to find it's focus. You have to frame your shot, press the shutter part way down and hold it there till the green light comes on. Actually there are two lights that let you know the status of the camera as you shoot. Both of these lights are directly under the viewfinder and can be seen with the same eye as you frame your shot. The amber light will flash until the flash unit is charged, then when the green light comes on you can press the shutter the rest of the way down and the shot will be taken.

Actually, results are very good as far as quality. The camera comes with an 8 MB flash card which will allow storage of about 36 good quality snapshots. You can shoot in a high quality mode but you will be able to store only 2 photos on the supplied memory card. Battery consumption is far greater than I expected. Now I always carry an extra 4 AA cells in my pocket. You'll find that the camera is energized a lot between shots due to loss of setting when you turn it off. This eats up the batteries pretty fast. In fact I have never gotten through 36 shots without replacing the batteries. My camera came with 4 rechargable cells and a charger.

All in all perfect for snapshots. Quality is good. Rugged and compact. I recommend it for purposes like my own.<br><br>
