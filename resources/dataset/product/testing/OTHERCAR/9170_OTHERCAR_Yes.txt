            I think the RAV 4 is an excellent car for many things. Tight turns, small parking spots, long trips - this car is the car! However, the base model is simply a base model and each RAV 4 can be customized to meet the buyer's needs.
It has a significant appeal, is available in a wide variety of colors for the exterior.  I was unsatisfied with the awful cloth interior, so I elected to upgrade to grey leather.  The front seats are profoundly comfortable, even for very long trips and they lay out of the dash and center console, is extremely user friendly. The back seats  leave much to be desired but, would be ok for kids or children, as the space is quite limited in the leg room.
The flexibility of the cargo space is a plus.  You can fold down the back seats and have adequate, carpeted space to store/move most items.  Though, if this is your purpose for purchasing the RAV4, please test both back seats in the down position, so you get a reasonable idea of the space. I drove across country and packed the cargo space, I also liked the added weight it gave the car.
Some people may not know that this &quot;SUV&quot; doesn't come with standard four wheel drive.  The base models are simply front wheel drive cars.  I opted for the all wheel drive and this little car handles very well in the snow and rain despite its very light weight.
All wonderful cars have some cons and I think the cost of extra options could be perceived as a con.  Though I am quite pleased with my sunroof, tinted glass, leather interior, matalic exterior, life time road side protection, &quot;paint protection,&quot; 4 wheel drive option - all of these things boosted my cost to another galaxy.  Secondly, the engine is rather slow.  Hence, it has no pick up.  Yet once the car reaches a cruising speed, the ride is quite comfortable.
I perceive the biggest con to be the weight of the car and how it would handle a collision.  I can't imagine it would handle an impact too well.<br><br>
