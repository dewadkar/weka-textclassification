                I purchased a 1998 kia a year and a half ago. I had a problem with the air conditioning in the beginning but Kia fixed it very quickly. Although, it took two tries, they ended up putting a new air conditioner in. While they were trying to fix my car, I had a rental car they entire time. 
     I like the roominess that it has. I have 4 children and did not want a minivan. My Kia has plenty of leg room for my 4 kids and they range in height from 5'2&quot; to 6'4&quot; tall. It has plenty of trunk room also. I wish it would have come with a trunk light though. You do not know how much you use a trunk light until you don't have one.
     I also like the roadside assistance that came with the car. It overheated once and I called the 800 number and they took care of me very quickly and efficiently.<br><br>
