            My experience with the QV-770 started last year when I bought the camera for putting pictures online. I've had a number of problems with it and some new ones that have recently developed.

One of the biggest problems I've had with it is in focusing. It won't focus on anything flat. The bottom will be out of focus if the top is in focus, and vice versa. Also, like most autofocus cameras, it tends to focus on the nearest part of the object and the background tends to blur. 
The lens is mounted on a rotating section which is a wonderful feature for shooting product shots and closeups, but forces your hand into some strange contortions to avoid taking pictures of your fingers. Lately it's developed a short circuit of some type in the rotating mechanism and the screen goes fuzzy at most any angle you turn it except locked straight ahead. Jiggling it a bit brings it back sometimes.

It does poorly in bright light with colors washing out and doesn't handle low light well either. In fact the entire color balance is far from accurate. I've had to build a special lighting enclosure from diffraction film and illuminated with halogen lights just to shoot with this camera.

It's loaded with ridiculous features that do nothing but run up the price and increase complexity. How useful is a low grade, 3.2 second video? The menu and button system are not intuitive at all. With its poor ergonomics, you find your fingers hitting buttons that shouldn't be where they are. Battery life is short, but I guess that's to be expected with any digital camera. That's what nicads are for and they've been a lifesaver.

Good points? Yeah, it has a few. The pictures it takes in economy mode are almost perfectly sized for online use with nothing but a little cropping. The picture clarity is good in the focused areas with good contrast and smooth shading. It was also easy to hook to the computer and simple to import pictures. I've seen some camera setups that were a nightmare to install on the computer.

I'm sure digital cameras have improved much since this model. I sure hope so. I definately do not recommend this camera if this is indicative of their performance.
