            A few years ago, I became interested in digital photography. I decided to buy my first digital camera, which was a Mustek. This camera was a joke. As I became more savvy in what to look for in digital cameras, I purchased and returned the following models: Olympus 300R (no zoom), Ricoh 4200 (bad low light photos), Olympus 400z (poor colour saturation), Yashica 1300 DG (poor design), Ricoh 5000 (lots of &quot;noise&quot; in photos) and finally the Toshiba PDR-M3, which what I have had for the last 6 months. 

During this 6-month period, I have taken over 500 photos. This camera has been to Disneyland 2 times and several sporting events. I have been very happy with the results that I have obtained on screen and in print. 

This camera is perfect for the person who enjoys taking photos and being able to display them on web pages, e-mail and print. At 1.5 mega pixels, this camera will give you excellent results. This camera would be just right for someone starting out in digital photography. Since this camera uses a lithium ion battery, you can get more photos than you would with rechargeable batteries (just make sure you buy an extra battery). This camera uses Smart Media as its method of storage and can accept up to 32MB smart media cards.
