            I have a 95 Mercury Villager I bought new and it has been nothing but a pleasure to own and drive. I have over 170,000 on it and have never had a major problem. It still drives as good as the day I bought it. It will carry 6 adults very comfortable. My kids perfer it on long trips over the Ford Explorer we have because of the great seats and amount of room they have. I have friends with other mini vans that have had many problems that I have never had. I think this is a great van for any family or anyone who drives a SUV if they can live without driving a status symbol.   <br><br>
