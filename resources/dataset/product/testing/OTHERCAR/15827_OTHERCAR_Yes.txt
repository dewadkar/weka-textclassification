            This car is in a word, awesome.  It has a sporty feel to it, yet it nice accents that give it a more &quot;refined&quot; feel.  My mom drives a 1999 Solara SE V-6.  

This car has elegant styling that reminds me of the Lexus SC series.  The back seat is roomy for a coupe; the JBL stereo system is very nice.  It is smooth ride, but it also is very tight around the curves.  

The only complaint I have about the car is that with the moon roof option the roof is too low in the cabin area.  I am 5'7&quot; tall, and my head is about 1&quot; to a 1/2&quot; from the ceiling.  Any one over 5'8&quot; has to crouch down while in the car.  The interior styling is a little bland, and the radio display's numbers are like 2&quot; tall.  My mom had problems with the car starting when she used regular grade gasoline, since she has upgraded to ultra-premium (and ultra pricey!) gasoline, she has not had any problems with it.

I am really impressed with this car - I have it on my to-drive list when I am ready to turn in my Corolla.  The only piece of advice I have to offer is that unless you are 5'6&quot; or shorter, don't opt for the moon-roof!
