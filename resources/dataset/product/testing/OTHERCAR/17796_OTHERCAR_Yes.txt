               Earlier this year,our minivan was leaving the realm of "reliable transport", and entering into "enthusiast" territory, and as I'd never been too enthusiastic about the minivan anyway,the decision was taken to change.
   We needed something to be comfortable, easily accessed, reliable, and suitable for use as the family vehicle .......I saw it as a chance to get the car I'd wanted for a while, a Lincoln Town Car.
   As usual, budget restrictions came into play, and so the field was narrowed to the 1997-2000 range, and the search began. While in one lot, my wife spotted well kept Grand Marquis. Inspection revealed it to be a 1998, with less than 27,000 miles, and most options fitted. I wasn't convinced, but a drive changed that. It wasn't exactly what I wanted, but close enough, and the deal offered was too good to pass up.
 
   Ownership of the car has only confirmed the correctness of this decision further. The first joy came when we reported the change to our insurance company, premiums fell by around $30/month. Next we we realised we can still fit six (with no interior cargo, the minivan could take seven), and have luggage room to spare, and return around the same fuel consumption from a bigger,quieter, and faster, engine. :-)
   We've now owned the car for six months, taken the mileage to over 31,000, and love it. The effortless covering of distance, combine with opulent surroundings make this the ideal road trip car. 
  The climate control is a blessing in Florida, happiness is never having to adjust the A/C. Just set the temperature you want, and forget. The one bad thing is that when it's cold, it will not blow air until the engine has heated sufficiently. This can lead to condensation problems, but can be manually overridden.
   The trunk is huge, and can normally swallow all we throw at it easily, the only downer being the positioning of the spare,the overhang of which limits the trunk use for larger items, so it must be removed on occasion.
   The air suspension provides a magic carpet ride, whether I have three bicycles slung on the rear, our 12 yr old daughter in the back, or three 200 pound colleagues on a lunch run.
   Besides routine maintenance, I have replaced the battery on this car, and the tires (though still having plenty of tread, they showed symptoms of prolonged underinflation, causing belt problems, and seriously affecting the handling). It looks good, performs well, handles for it's size,is cheap to run......what more could you want? Okay, perhaps a CD player, but that's coming soon....
   It is also worth noting that with the popularity of this car (at least here in Florida, the retirement state) parts are easy to come by and relatively inexpensive. This is also helped by the commonality of parts with the Crown Victoria, and Town Car. 
  In fact, the only real down side of this car is that since we've got it, I've been constantly reminded that I've now got my luxury car, when is my wife getting her convertible?

UPDATE: 27 Aug 03
   Having lived with this car for over a year now, and used it for a couple of interstate trips as well as my regular use, my opinion of this car is largely unchanged. It is supremely comfortable, can swallow large loads, and looks great.  I have experienced no problems, other than previously described.
   I replaced the standard sound system with an MP3 player, (which is like having a six disc changer in the dash, only with less discs to store), a move I would recommend to anyone. 
   Several of my younger colleagues who disdained the car changed their tune after travelling in it.
   Earlier this month, while travelling home from work I was stopped alongside a School bus displaying stop signs & flashing reds, when I was rear-ended by another vehicle travelling around forty mph. The back end of my car, and the drivers seat, were extensively damaged (around $8000 worth), but I walked away with only a neck sprain & a jaw injury. The other driver was hospitalized.
   I am convinced that this vehicle was a significant factor in reducing possible injuries.
   I have been driving a rental now for almost three weeks (A Buick Century), and miss my car terribly. I'm looking forward to getting it back soon. The repairs are being carried out by a Mercury dealership, and I will update when I get it back to notify if any differences are evident.
