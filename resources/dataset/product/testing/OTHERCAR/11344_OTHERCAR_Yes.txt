            In November 1999, we purchased our first mini van.  We had been wanting one for about 2 years.  We have a little one (plan on having at least 1 more) and 3 dogs and of course my husband and myself.  We take alot of road trips and were having trouble all fitting in our SUV.  We only looked at the Caravan/Voyager.  We got a program vehicle in great shape.  So far, we love it.  It's got alot of room in all 3 rows of seats.  We've had alot of company visit since then and it's great having enough room for another couple with another child.  We have a 5 door (two on each side + trunk) and that makes it so much easier.  We bought a Grand Caravan SE.  The seats are comfortable and it is just so much more roomier all around.  The best feature is seperate heat/ac controls for driver/passenger.  Makes it easier not to argue over the temperature of the vehicle!  All seats come out to make it easier to haul.  Lots of extras that you don't realize are helpful until you have them!<br><br>
