            When my husbands truck lost it's last legs we needed to get a good inexpensive vehicle.  After looking at many used cars that were outrageously priced, we started looking at new Kias.  During the test drive I noticed that the Kia was very *simple* meaning it didn't have a lot of gadgets or decorations.  It seems to drive nice enough.  At the time we bought the car I was 2 months pregnant and thought the seats were very comfortable and there was alot of room.  The problem came after the baby was born.  When trying to put a car seat in the back I found the middle seat belt too long on the clasp side making the carseat sit lopsided, so I then tried to put the carseat on either side.  Well, the seat belts on the sides have shoulder harnesses that do not lock so I would have to use a locking clip to make sure the seat belt didn't move.  I could not even get to the belt to put a locking clip on it, there was no room and I would need another set of hands to hold the belt AND the carseat in place, other than that it is a good car.  We have had no problems in the 2 years we have had it except for the warped rotors which were repaired under warranty.

Update 1 year later: When the battery died one weekend, we of course went to the local Auto supply store only to find out the only way to get a new battery for the Kia is to take your car (have it towed) to the dealer and pay almost $100.00 for a battery.  Air filters are just as hard to find and not easy to get to to replace it in the first place.
