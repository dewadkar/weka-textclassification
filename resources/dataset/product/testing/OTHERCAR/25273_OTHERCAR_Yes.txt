            I bought this truck new in June, 1995.  Over 100,000 miles later, it is still going strong with no major problems and very few minor ones.  I have the two wheel drive, club cab with the SLT package.  The truck handles very well, is quiet and will do 80 mph down the interstate all day with no problems.  The bench rear seat is great for kids, but a strain for adults.  The gauges are easy to see & useful.  I like having the cruise control on the steering wheel.  Fit and finish have always been great.

If you are carrying a load in the bed itself, you will not notice much difference in the handling characteristics.  It will even help out the handling if it gets wet.  However, even with the overdrive cut out switch, this truck does not like to tow heavy loads.  It effects handling and destroyes gas mileage.

I plan to get a new truck soon.  After my experiences with the Dakota, Dodge is the only place I will be looking for a replacement.
