            The new 2000 Chevrolet Suburban is truly a pleasure to own and to drive.  This is my second consecutive Suburban and I or my wife will probably never drive anything else as our family vehicle.

The greatest thing that the Chevy Suburban offers is room to spare.  If you have children, grandchildren, or just &quot;tote&quot; people around there is no other to have.  The leg and head room are exceptional even in the third row of seating.  I am over six feet tall and I can sit comfortably in the third seat, with no neck cramping.  That is one thing that I noticed in third row seating of both the Ford Expedition and the Excursion.  Both of my Suburbans have offered 9 passenger seating.  That means a bench seat in all three rows.  You can equip the Suburban with front bucket seats, front bench seating, second row bench seating, or second row bucket seating.  The third row seat is always a bench seat.  My children are still small but as they get out of the child seat stage, I can see how that the bucket seating in the second row would be nice.  All parents know that the further children are away from each other on a trip, the quiter the ride!

The 2000 model offers substantial design reform from the longstanding previous body style. Not that the old one was bad, but this one has it all.  The new engine, the 5300 V8, has a noticeable increase in horsepower over the old 5.7 liter 350 workhorse from GM.  The new motor also offers increased fuel economy.  My best highway mileage in my 1999 model was 19.  In a recent trip to the Corvette museum in Bowling Green, KY, I was amazed by my new found 22 MPG on the highway.  Hey, it is a 42 gallon fuel tank!  Every bit of economy counts!!

Finally, the new 2000 model comes equipped with ONStar, cool!!!, pre-wired cellular provisions, lots of cup holders, great musical sound, smooth rides, and dependable Chevrolet quality.  Hey, I'm a Chevy man, and I understand the value of paying more for a Chevy truck product.  Just remember in all things purchased.....  You get what you pay for, so make it worth your while.   Happy Driving!<br><br>
