            With a baby and two dogs, we needed to find a vehicle that could accommodate everyone without sacrificing comfort nor succumbing to the dreadful minivan nor bland station wagon.

This Montero is surprisingly comfortable for such a stark, ultilitarian appearance.  The full-power inside has a great sound system, comfortable seats, and nice leg room in the back compared to most cars.  Unlike some other SUVs, there's more cargo area because the spare tire is mounted outside.

I'm 6'2&quot;, and front leg room is slightly cramped.  Headroom is great.  My 5'9&quot; wife finds the driving position great though.  Short folks may have a little bit of a tough time climbing aboard.

It's got enough power to tow a light trailer or keep speed on a hill, sits high above other cars, and feels indestructible in less than ideal conditions.  Feels very solid.

The ride isn't a luxurious one, nothing close to a family sedan.  It's a SUV with a strong suspension, after all.  But I like that.

Reliability has been acceptable with common engine repair needs.  No transmission problems.

The air conditioning is adequate on all but the hottest days.  Tinted windows seems necessary to cope with that.
