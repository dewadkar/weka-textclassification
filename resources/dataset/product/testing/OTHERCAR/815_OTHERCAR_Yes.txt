            I've had my Casio QV-11 for a couple of years now and I ABSOLUTELY ADORE IT!!!!! =)  When I purchased this camera, it was knowing that later in life I would buy a camera with better resolution as the prices drop.  However for the price, it's a great camera.

I use my digital almost exclusively because I love the ease of processing my own photographs.  When I had a 35MM, the film was always getting ruined by the children or I would forget to take it to be developed.

What I like about the Casio QV-11
The Casio QV-11 allows you to store up to 96 pictures with no extra memory card.  
The link provided to transfer them to your hard drive is very easy and very fast.  
It comes with an electrical adapter to help conserve on batteries.
It's lightweight and easy to use.
There is an onscreen display to see exactly what you are shooting.
There is a 360ï¿½ lens to help your aim or to take pictures of yourself.
It has a switch for close shots (macro) or normal shots.  This affects the focus.
It has an indoor/outdoor switch for different lighting purposes.

What I would like to see different on the Casio QV-11
Next Digital Camera purchase with definitely have a flash!!  =)
I have to use Adobe Photoshop to adjust my pictures.  Every photo needs a bit more contrast.  However, this is also an advantage.  With digital photos I am ABLE to adjust my photos as I deem necessary.  Sometimes I enjoy this as much at the picture taking process itself.  LoL
Not photo quality yet, but for the price, I was not expecting this.
Sometimes in bright outdoor light, I have trouble seeing the display.

All in all, yes, I highly recommend this purchase.  If you can afford better resolution, go for it!  But if you looking for the best quality for the lowest price, definitely check out the Casio QV-11.<br><br>
