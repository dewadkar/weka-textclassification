            I've had this car 3 years and I've not had one problem with it. I repaired a few chips in the paint and that's it. It's good on gas. It's a joy to drive, my wife loves it. The optional roof rack holds 160 pounds on each bar, Ive carried a canoe and a couple of kayaks as well as packs up top. And the rack is so high, I don't have a single scratch on my roof. My last vehicle had barely any paint left on the roof. The only negative is that my students claim it's the prefered vehicle of soccer moms. And, I definitely wouldn't want to try and tow anything with it. If you need towing power, get something else. <br><br>
