            I was in the market for a reasonably priced digital camera and found that the Olympus D360L gave me more of the options of a higher priced digital camera for a lower price.  The ease of use with this camera was great from the moment I opened the box. I dropped in the batteries (which were included), turned it on, snapped a photo, and viewed it.  Simple.  Using the software that came with the camera, it is a breeze to get the photos from the camera on to my computer.  I like everything about this camera, for me there is nothing NOT to like about it.

To keep taking great pictures at any time I recommend purchasing two sets of 4 AA rechargeable batteries and a recharger so you have a set in the camera and a set recharged and ready when you need them!

Anyone in the market for a good digital camera at a reasonable price, should get the Olympus <br><br>
