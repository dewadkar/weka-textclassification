            I didn't buy a Durango, I rented one.  That -- to me -- is a very smart method of getting to drive a vehicle wherever you want to without some salesman leaning over your shoulder and rattling off bogus statistics in your ear.  It may cost you $50 or $100 to rent, but it's a smart investment.  I was lucky, I got to charge the rental to a client as a business expense!  I've driven at least a dozen different makes and models of cars, bans, trucks, and SUVs over the past year, typically for about three or four days and 400-500 miles. You get to know a vehicle pretty well in that time.

I picked it up with 800 miles on it, and put on 450 in four days. Heavy highway use, with some city driving as well.  In comparison, in the last six weeks I've also driven a Jeep Cherokee, luxury cars, mid-size cars, minivans, 15-passenger vans, and 4WD pickups.  If there were only two vehicles on the market; a Durango and a Cherokee; I'd buy the Durango.  That, however, is damning with faint praise, 'cause I think Cherokees have been junk ever since they were introduced.  But enough editorializing about Jeeps, here's my take on the 2001 Durango, as compared to my recent experiences in other vehicles:

It's a big, almost brutish vehicle compared to the cars out there, but isn't ocean-liner-sized like a Suburban or an Expedition. The driver sits on high, with a commanding view of the road that is only partially obscured by an overly long hood. The 8-cylinder engine purrs throatily, almost sexily, as it sucks up gasoline to the tune of 13 MPG. That exhaust sound could be a babe magnet! 

The Durango rides like a truck, not like a passenger car. Handling is fair, with nervous steering that makes it tough to drive a smooth curve at speeds of 40-50 mph.  The transmission has a tendency to waver between 2nd and drive more than I would like, but when you punch this baby it leaps like a scalded muskrat.  On smooth roads the ride's fine, but irregular surfaces left the Durango bouncing like one of those inflatable castles at kiddy theme parks.  I have no idea how it would handle off-road, but then nobody really buys these things for off-road anyway, right?  This one, by the way, was a Texas Special -- a 2WD SUV.

All in all, the mechanical part seems about average. Styling has improved since the semi-retro look of the bulging fenders on early Durangos; I didn't find any poor welds or irregular spacing on joints, but I wasn't looking all that closely to detail (plus it was dark a lot of the time). Where Daimler-Chrysler has fallen down on this vehicle is in interior. They've done a good job of supplying tons of little compartments for stuffing small things; cupholders and other similar-sized nooks and crannies abound.  There's diddly for cargo space with the third seat in place, but no one over 3-feet zero could get into that back seat without needing surgery!  The attention to detail in design, however, is truly weak. The instrument panel and dashboard look as if they were lifted almost directly off a late 70s pickup; with outmoded displays and details. The pockets in the door are cheesy molded plastic; the rear seat pockets had not been trimmed at the factory and still had strands of old plastic hanging off.  

From the driver's seat it was impossible to see the heater controls as I drove, because the column-mounted shift lever was in front of them. I also had to squat down next to the driver's door to find the parking brake and hood releases, because neither is visible from the seat.

Speaking of that seat, the one I rode in was remarkably adjustable, and yet strangely uncomfortable. Although it had adjustable lumbar support, it hit me too high on the back.  There were also a couple of prominent seams that kept rubbing the wrong way.

So there you have it: Durango's a vehicle that hasn't reached its full potential.  It boasts power and maneuverability, but suffers from bad ergonomics and poor sight lines to the instruments.  It's big outside but cramped inside.  It's uncomfortable and uneconomical, but it looks good.  I guess it's a perfect metaphor for the US-made automobile of the 70s!
