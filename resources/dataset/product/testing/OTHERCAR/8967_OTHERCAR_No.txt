            I bought a 93 mercury topaz a year ago and  not to impressed the air conditioner does not work i spent over 600 to 700 dollars on it on repairs
on the first 6 months
it burns gas like hell! my dad pressured me in to picking this car i made a mistake it rattles and make weird noises. if you like to spend money get this car!!   the good things about the car let see it runs, that is about everything that is good about it, oh it smells ok  i bought this car cause my dad made me excited about it now i just wish i can start all over well i am stuck with it so i better be nice to it for know. i wanted it because it was a 4 cylinder and was good on gas the sales man said but it is really bad on gas to me! i just wanted a car that is not a fortune! this is not a car for young people !  <br><br>
