            I've waited a while to post a review to get a fair amount of experience with the car.  My wife and I have put 3700 miles on the car, all in the city and just had it in for its first service.

First all the things we like about the car.  It handles very well for an econobox.  It is very maneuverable in parking lots and city traffic.  It has very good acceleration for a 1.5 liter engine.  I have been surprised by its ability to climb hills and have yet to get in a situation I couldn't accelerate safely out of.  The brakes are phenomenal, I usually stop short when I drive the Rio after driving our minivan.  We got the anti-lock brake option and strongly recommend it.

The car is comfortable for two, tolerable for three and manageable by four for a short trip only.  The trunk will hold a week's worth of groceries for a family of four.

The Rio has good ergonomics with one exception.  The radio controls are logically placed and the buttons big enough for adult fingers.  The lights and wipers are clearly marked and the driver's side armrest is an unexpected pleasure.  The cupholder is terrible.  My wife put a car cup in the cupholder and I didn't see it.  When I put the car in Park I about broke my finger against the edge of the cupholder.  You have to remove your cup to put the car in park.

Things we don't care for.  The car is loud.  Ours just developed a hooting sound at highway speeds.  With the A/C running and the car at idle you almost have to shout.  It bangs going over potholes and rough pavement.  The shifts are rough and jerky both when upshifting and downshifting.  The mileage has been disappointing so far.  I drive a Chevy Impala at work and get 20-21 mpg in the city.  The Rio is averaging about same so far.  My wife does have a lead foot, but I expected to get at least 25-28 mpg.

Last, service.  We had good luck so far.  My wife gave the service manager the vague description of a "rattling under the driver's seat at idle".  From that they found we have a bad flex plate and that is currently scheduled to be fixed.  We have been happy with our local service department so far.
