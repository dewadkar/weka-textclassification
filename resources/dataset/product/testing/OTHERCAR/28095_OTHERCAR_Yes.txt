            Let me first say that Polaroid truly has an exceptional customer service policy. I will get to their outstanding support in a bit. About 6 months ago I was in the market for a new digital camera and after going to several different places, including eBay, I ended up in Walmart, of all places, for an unrelated errand. I took notice of the PDC-700 because I heard via a �consumer bargain hunt� thing on my local news that said �Polaroid was the best buy for the money when it comes to digi-cams.� After conducting a cursory review of the specs I felt it met my requirements and decided to give it a shot. I paid I think $202 with tax.

This is what the camera comes with, a leather case that hooks up to a belt, a wrist strap, two programs: Photomax Image maker and Photomax Pro (personally I feel both of the programs are poor but they do the job), 1 video input cord for the VCR, AC Power Adapter + cord, USB cable, and an Instructional card. You can also enjoy features like a neat built in rubber hand grip, a conventional optical view finder, thumbnail images (map of all pics saved in memory) displayed right on the LCD screen, self shot timer with 10 second delay, tripod socket and optional stamped time and date on the pics. Not bad for an affordably priced device like this one is.
 

The camera itself is setup well. The shutter button has a nice size and is easy to find, but its close to the lens, that is right at the upper corner of the device so you need to watch your finger (personally I haven�t encountered a pic with my finger in it as of yet). The quality of the pics is great the PCD-700 has about 6 settings that I have used. There is VGA (640x480) and XGA (1024x768). There are 3 sub settings for each of those settings. Superfine, Fine and Normal mode. You have to take note of these settings particularly because the internal memory of the camera is 4mb, hence the Higher the setting the more of the 4mb free space you use.  For example an XGA, Superfine setting will allow you to take 12 pics in one session compared to a setting like VGA, normal mode that allows you to take 90 pics. All of this, I found very easy to set up.

Here is a little more about its Buttons: On back of the camera you have 7 buttons which can be a little confusing if you are new to digital cameras, I had no problem with this. My problem with the buttons was the power button. The power is controled by a slide type button that is more easily controlled if you have a finger nail to move it with.


The PDC-700 has a brilliant 1.8�LCD color view screen, problem is when you have it on it will eat your batteries up quite quickly (4 AA batteries). On the average I would say you can take about 25-30 pics with it on, so I have learned to keep it turned off. Even still, when it is off,  the LCD turns on every time you take a pic, asking �do you want to delete the pic now?� thus consuming the life of the battery, but it does last longer with it off. 

 
The camera also has a macro lens setting which can be easily set with a slide button on the side of the camera. This enables the photographer to take close up shots of small things or face shots. This doesn�t mean you can get with in centimeters of an object and expect it to be focused; the range is from 8� to 18�. My only problem is it has no zoom and the camera is quite fragile, even for a camera. I dropped it once from about 3 feet and it stopped working.

Incidentally, since I mentioned that it stopped working when I dropped it, I should also mention that Polaroid�s customer service (1800 number people) were very helpful and courteous. Polaroid replaced my camera virtually no questions asked.

System requirements are 166 pentium or higher to operate the software, 16 MB RAM, 90 MB free memory, a USB port and CD-Rom drive (x2 or higher)
