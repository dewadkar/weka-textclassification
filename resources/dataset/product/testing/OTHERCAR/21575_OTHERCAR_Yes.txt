            Based upon personal experience and research.  The Dodge Intrepid is a high quality car.  Just this past weekend my fiance and I purchased a 95 Dodge Intrepid.  The reasons that we choose the Intrepid was because of it's looks, gas mileage, cargo space and also the luxuries of owning a car with nice tilt bucket seats the operate electronically.  Also what helped us make the decisions to purchase this car was how it rides.  The ride is far superior to that of my Chevoret truck, which I notice every little bump in the road.  Trips are going to be a breeze with this new car.  I just wonder why more people don't buy the Intrepid?  Guess those who don't will never know what their missing.
