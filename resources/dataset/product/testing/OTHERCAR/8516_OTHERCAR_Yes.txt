            I believe that every family that owns a house and has two vehicles needs for at least one of the vehicles to be a truck. The problem is trucks have become so loaded with options and the high consumer demand have made them quite expensive. I went in search of a &quot;base&quot; model truck that was comfortable but did not have so many bells and whistles to price it out of my budget. I want to be able to haul something in a truck that did not have the price tag of a Cadillac. 

A &quot;base&quot; model Chevy or GMC looked too plain and was stripped (A/C extra). At least a stripped Dodge looks nice. The Dodge Ram Club Cab ST fit the description of a truck I was looking for. The ride and handling are good for a truck and with the tried and true 318 engine it has plenty of power. It is not totally a base truck because it has A/C, cruise, tilt steering wheel, AM/FM stereo cassette, bright chrome wheels and a two tone paint job. It would have cost a fortune to make a Chevy look that good.

It was a little mystery to me as to why the 2001 Dodge Rams have been out since the first of 2000. The salesman explained that it had to do with emissions laws. In simple terms, for each year model, the emissions for every vehicle sold of a particular model are totaled. The car company is allowed so much total emissions for each model. These numbers are made up but, for example, a Dodge with a V10 engine might have twice the emissions of a small V8 so Dodge could sell one V10 or two V8's. The salesman said that Dodge basically &quot;used up&quot; their emissions allowances for the 2000 year model by selling so many V10's and larger V8's. Dodge then brought out the 2001 models which, according to the salesman, will be produced until August of 2001. The V8 engine found in most 2000 models was the 360 but most of the 2001's have a 318. (By the way, this is the last year for the 318). Using the smaller V8 will allow Dodge to keep the total emissions down and still sell more trucks. Again this a simplified description of the emissions regulations based upon what the salesman said. 


If you are looking for a great truck that does not cost a fortune but still looks and drives good , consider the Dodge Ram. 

P.S. Make sure as a part of the test drive you test to see if you can get it in your garage. The long wheel base may be longer than you think and I know of several people that have to park in the driveway because their truck will not fit in the garage.
