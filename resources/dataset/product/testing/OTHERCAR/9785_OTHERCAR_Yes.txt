            I traded my D1 in on the S1 because of the better color and resolution the S1 produces.  The D1 is a much better built camera but does not even come close to producing the color and quality of the S1.  I can go straight from the camera to my pictograph printer and get excellent results.  The D1 was a joy to operate and got good results in photo journalistic areas but was not good for portraits.  The S1 gives you almost the entire range of Nikon lenses and flash equipment.  The S1 allows you to have another card installed in the camera besides the ibm micro-drive in case you run out of storage space.  i do like the protective cover for the viewing screen provided with the D1 Fuji might think about some kind of protective cover on future models.  The S1 is so easy to use i am looking forward to when professional labs will start charging the same for print prices as they do for film.  I do not understand why they charge a higher price when much of the new processing equipment today will take digital files the same as film.  I am looking forward to the time i will not have to purchase film anymore.  I believe the quality of prints i am obtaining are equal to and better than 35mm film.  It is also very close to 645 film which i use for much of my sports memory mate photography <br><br>
