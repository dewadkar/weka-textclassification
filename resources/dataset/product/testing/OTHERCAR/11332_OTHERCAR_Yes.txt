            As a mother of three active boys, I spend a great deal of time in our vehicle.  We are the proud owners of a '99 Grand Caravan....our second Caravan!  We purchased another Caravan because we were so happy with our first.  

First of all, the Grand Caravan has great pickup when merging onto the highway!  What ZIP!  Braking is never a worry....I can stop on a dime!  Grand Caravan also has dual side front airbags and adjustable seatbelts.

Aside from regular maintainence, our Grand Caravan hasn't seen the inside of the repair shop.

We really like the two captain's chairs in the middle seating area.  They are comfortable and allow the passengers to enjoy plenty of leg room and a nice high headrest.  Even the &quot;way back&quot; seats are comfortable enough for adults.  

When travelling with children, you need lots of storage areas.  The Grand Caravan has plenty of cup holders and other storage bins.  I especially love the hatch storage area!  The tire changing tools are in a small stowage area and the back of the rear seat has hooks to hang your plastic grocery bags!  Sounds corny, but that feature alone has thrilled me beyond belief.  No more apples rolling all over the car!  

The Caravan has convenience features too numerous to mention.  I love the two sliding doors! No more running around the car to get the kids in and out.  The overhead lights on either side of the middle seats allow the rear passengers to read in the dark without disturbing the driver.  There is also a mesh bag that attaches to the drivers seat that is great for containing all the &quot;stuff&quot; you bring into the car!

If you are looking for a reliable, comfortable vehicle for your family, consider the Dodge Grand Caravan. You will be pleased with your purchase.
