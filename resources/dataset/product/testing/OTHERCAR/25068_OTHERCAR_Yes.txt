            The DC-4800 camera has exceeded the toy and handy snapshot uses for past digital cameras. This camera is ready for the truly professional photographer.
Capture full detail with 3.1 megapixel in uncompressed resolution. The camera has adjustable ISO sensitively which is adjustable to a equivalent film speed of a ISO of 100 for daylight, ISO of 200 for cloudy overcast conditions and an ISO 400 dusk, night pictures, with or without flash. Both optical and digital zoom is available. The exposure compensation, the white balance, the picture quality, sharpness, and shutter speed are fully adjustable plus any or all can be placed in auto mode. Plus the date can be placed on the photo in several date formats.
I especially liked a full comfortable neck strap that minimizes setting the camera down and walking off.
The bottom line is that the final pictures are GREAT.
I purchased this camera with a 64 MB card in a package.
