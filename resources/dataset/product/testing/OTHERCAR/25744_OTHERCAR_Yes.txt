            I was first very attracted to the New Volkswagon beetle because of the different array of colors that they come in! They come in Yellow, Blue, Green, Red, White, Black, and Silver. I have always wanted a yellow car , but most of the yellow cars out there are not the yellow that i like. The Beetle was the perfect yellow. Also, the colors inside the car are awesome. The lights are bright red and blue and light up the dashboard. It's a lot of fun to drive and I get a lot of attention from everybody on the road. On the highway it drives very smoothly. One problem that i had which is minor, was that the gas tank cover is supposed to lock shut, but it won't close all the way. i have seen this on more than a few beetles. Another problem, is that they dent very easily and they are very low to the ground. If you just rub a curb with your beetle, it will be noticeable. So far that is the worst of them! There is plenty of room in the back seat and the trunk, so as far as room goes , there isn't a problem! I love my Yellow Beetle!!!
