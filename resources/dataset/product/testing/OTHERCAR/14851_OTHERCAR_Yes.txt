            First of all, this is the 5.7L V8 Trans Am GT I'm reviewing, not the V6 version.  I'll try to give as thorough a review as possible, so I'll break this up into several categories:

Normal Driving:
For day to day drivers, the practicality depends on your preference.  Trunk space is adequate for groceries and small to medium size items, but not as spacious as a 'normal' trunk.  There are 2 seats in the back, though they are not particularly roomy for adults.  Gas mileage I've found to be around 18mpg, nothing extraordinary.  I live in WV however, and the mountains surely affect my mileage, so if you're not among the hills, you could probably expect anywhere from 20-24 I would estimate.  Other than that, it's like any other car, but with an attitude.

Aggressive Driving:
This car is definitely fast, but it's on the highways that you truly feel it.  You can accelerate from 70-80 or 80-90mph, etc with ease, just as you would expect to go from 30-40.  It is practically instant and passing on the highways couldn't be easier.  Off the line, the pickup is healthy as well.  Handling is very decent on curves, and mountains do not phase this car in the slightest.  My only complaint (besides wet weather) is the light rear end.

Traction:
Simply stated, excellent on dry roads, bad on wet roads, and terrible in winter conditions.  Not impossible, but not ideal if you're looking for a winter specific vehicle.

Maintenance Costs:
Unfortunately, to own a sports car you'll continually have to pay for it.  You can forget about any of those '4 tires for $99' deals or anything even remotely close.  The absolute cheapest I could find to have 4 tires put on was $347.47 for 4 Kelly tires.  This took a lot of shopping and was rock bottom.  Closest 2nd place pricing came in at $414.  You could easily spend 600-1000+ for high quality tires.  To have rear brakes and rotors put on set me back $283, and to have a cracked serpentine belt replaced (found during an oil change) costs $80.00.  I haven't had anything else replaced or repaired, but based on those items, you can reasonable expect to pay a premium compared to non-sports cars.

Insurance:
Insurance costs weren't as bad as I imagined.  The difference between my 1996 Grand Prix and this 1994 Trans Am GT was about $20 per month.  Adds up over time, but very reasonable considering it's a sports car.

MISC:
This car likes to occasionally display the 'Service Engine Soon' light.  I haven't had it checked out because I haven't had any problems with the engine and it doesn't stay on.  My '96 Grand Prix also had the same trait, so maybe this is a Pontiac thing.  Probably the O2 sensor on both, but I thought I'd mention it anyway.  Also, like another reviewer mentioned, you will hear plenty of squeaks and rattles w/ this car.  However, w/ the radio turned on, they are completely drowned out.
