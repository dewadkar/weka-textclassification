            Chevrolet has always had a good name from what I heard. So, when I bought a used S-10, I had some high expectations. Granted, I bought a 2 wheel drive base model. But I never expected it to have the problems it did.
At 20,000 miles, the clutch was close to going out of it. The undercarriage was rusted soon after I bought it at 11,000 miles. Obviously, the manufacturer is cheap and doesn't provide the coating that others do. So, you have to apply that yourself to protect it from the weather. It had zero power, and barely accelerated. Very disappointing for a small truck.
Mainly, I was dissatisfied with the treatment I got through the factory authorized dealers who were supposed to do warranty work. Aside from the clutch, it also had a problem with the rear-end that were never fixed because we were given the runaround by several different locations.
Aside from all that, the truck had as much cab space as would be expected, and had a wonderful protective paint coat. It sat out in a huge hail storm and was the only vehicle in the neighborhood without a scratch, much less dents. That was surprising.
All in all, I've decided never to buy an S-10 again. That's due to my dissatisfaction with both the vehicle and customer service, as compared to the phenomenal treatment we now get from Toyota (no warranty work needed so far). I'm glad to pay a little more for a reliable product and customer service. <br><br>
