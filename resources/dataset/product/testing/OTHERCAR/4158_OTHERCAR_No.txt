            I bought my '95 rodeo at an end of season clearance around Christmas 95 on the advice of a friend.  Of course I can't speak for everyone, but I can tell my experience.

4WD:  Works great in 4-wheel drive.  I've had many opportunities to try it in the snow and have never got stuck even in some deep drifts.

RIDE:  The ride is noisy and bumpy.  It rides more like a truck than a car.

SIZE:  The size is good, except for a very small person.  It's easy to get into and puts you above many drivers.  Of course, many of the big SUVs are looking right down into the Rodeo.

SPARE TIRE:  I thought it was cool having the spare on the back of the SUV.  That was before I had to drive it everyday and my vision was blocked.  Next time I would get a hidden tire.

REAR WINDOW:  I really like how the window opens -- you don't even have to move the tire out of the way.

CUPHOLDER:  The installed one are not practical.

MAINTENANCE:  This has been a nightmare.  I had about $5,000 of repair work done under warranty (at no cost to me).  I now have 90,000 miles and have spend out of my pocket an additional $4,000+ on major repairs, including my second transmission, broken rear window latches, faulty ABS, blown radiator.

CUSTOMER SERVICE:  It's mixed here.  The first transmission went out under warranty and I was 400 miles from home.  Customer service did agree to pay for my rental car for 1 week while the transmission was repaired.  However, now though they agree that there are excessive repairs, they will not agree to any reimbursements and told me to sue them.<br><br>
