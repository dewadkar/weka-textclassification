            As I find myself trapped in this godforsaken country of hills and gorges  my love for my car grows even deeper.  Everytime I have to climb a series of hills to get to civilisation I cry a little tear in remembrance of the convenience and reliabilty my 1995 Toyota Corolla afforded me for so long.  Sometimes as I gaze upon the fresh crop of corns and blisters my cute feet never experienced before moving here,  I would be totally and utterly willing to vow to never see my friends and family again if only it meant having my car back.  

In some brilliant moment of manipulative glory, I talked my parents into buying me a car.  It was around 1998 when I reminded my parents that my wonderful intellect had won me four tuition free years of university, and it was only fitting that they repay that kindness with a vehicle.  I was also very very far away from them, so they'd better make it a reliable one as well.

I have to admit, when my dad first pointed it out I wasn't impressed.  After all, it looked like every other car out there, you know, champagne.  I was holding out for a Volkswagen Jetta or something with a little more personality.  But, I know when I'm pushing too far and if they were going to shell out the dough I would make the sacrifice of having a very boring car.  Besides, my main concern was to able to shun the bus as my tolerance of skin disorders and urine soaked seats was wearing extremely thin.  I quickly forgot about its plain exterior and saw it for the freedom it would allow me.

My parents are good people with extreme sadistic tendencies.  For a couple of weeks after we'd first spotted the car they were insistent that they could not get me a car at all.  Let alone a boring one.  By some cruel twist of fate, they were suddenly unable to provide me with a vehicle.  I let the matter go as well as my disposition will allow, and spent my days constantly grumbling about broken promises.  A couple days later during a particularly nasty spat, my parents told me to go outside.  In the driveway was my boring lil' Toyota with a big white bow on it.

It was then I realised what a complete and utter jerk I was.  I have not asked for anything since.  And certainly not without excessive guilt.

This car is quite simply, a lazy person's dream.  It has required nothing of me while in my service with the exception of oil changes and car washes.  It had 36,000 miles on it when they bought it, and I've added very few since then.  As far as I know, this car has spent its entire life in Minnesota and endured six Minnesota winters.  What a trooper, she never even hesitates to start in subzero temperatures.  It costs about $15 to fill up and gets great mileage. She comfortably fits me and three friends, and has been nothing but wonderful during our roadtrips.   While it is comfortable, it is not an unmanageable car and its size and shape can be easily manuevered.  One minute, I'm beginning to weep.  She even smells good.  And I decided that my plain Jane would be chock full of personality so I littered the inside with various sticker pictures and leftist propaganda.  She is simply breathtaking.  

Seriously, if you're in need of a car you know you can rely on and you're not desperate to prove your masculinity or speed like a demon, this is the car for you.  Cars are a lot like relationships, and if you want something short term and flashy, go elsewhere.  If you want an average pal who'll stick through it all and never complain, she's your girl.
