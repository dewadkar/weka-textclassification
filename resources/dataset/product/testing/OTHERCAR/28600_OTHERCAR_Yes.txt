            The Sahara is a great Jeep, it's tough and dependable!  The engine is powerful and the towing capacity handles much more than I can give it.  I always trust it to overcome any troubles I would have in the mountains of East Tenn and West North Carolina. Also, it has no problems on the sands of any Florida beach.  The hard top comes off in about 3 minutes (with 2 people) and it sits much higher on the road than its predessors and other Jeep-like clones.  In the hot Florida sun, the A/C is chilly to the point I actually get too cold when it is on full blast, and my Jeep is ALL BLACK!  Anyone who has a love for the road and adventure should buy this auto. <br><br>
