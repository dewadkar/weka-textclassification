            I was never that interested in getting a digital camera.  Yeah, I thought they looked nice and the concept was good.  They were always too expensive though.  For my birthday this year my girlfriend(EpinionID Mookasaurs) bought me the Kodak Millenium Edition camera.

The Millenium package came with an 8 Mb picture card and a USB Removable disk.  The 8 Mb card will hold about 26 pictures with this camera.  Very similar to the 25 pictures I was accustomed too with my advantix.  I wasn�t quite content with that.  When I go places I usually bring a couple rolls of film.  For use around the house 8 Mb is plenty.  I can take 26 pictures, load them on my hard drive and go for another round.  If I�m away though I can do that.  I was able to acquire a 32 Mb picture card and now I have plenty of storage for my pictures.  This card will hold 113 pictures at the highest resolution and over 250 at the lowest.  I�ve even heard that there is a 196 Mb picture card out, that�s just amazing.

The removable disk is very convenient.  It looks like a little mouse.  It connects into a USB port in your computer and you can slide your picture disk into the slot.  This is much more convenient than hooking the camera up to the computer every time you want to read the disk.  The setup for this was really easy and I was so close to being able to do it without the directions.  Of course my mom always says �people get paid good money to write those directions.�

Enough about the gizmos and gadgets, I�m sure you want to know about the camera.  The camera is extremely easy to use.  I still haven�t had to crack open the instruction booklet yet.  It only takes a few minutes to set the time, date and any other settings like resolution.  Put the picture card in and you�re ready to go.  For those who are use to a regular camera you�ll notice that the digital camera is much heavier.  Part of this is because of the 4 AA batteries required to operate the camera.  

Flip the power on, set the camera to capture mode, aim and shoot.  The picture will then come up on the LCD screen on the back of the camera.  You have the option to delete it if you want.  I suggest you don�t delete pictures till you need the space.  Even bad pictures are nice to look at later on in life.  You can always download them to your computer and not have to worry about them taking space on your picture card.  You can also set the camera to review mode and look at all of the pictures you have taken so far.  You�re allowed to delete pictures in this mode also.

The camera has three different flash modes.  On, off and red-eye reduction.  The flash is extremely bright so don�t look directly into the light.  There is also a timer on the camera so you can set it down and get into the picture yourself.  The zoom lens on the camera is a very nice feature to take close ups.  

There are a couple of downsides to the digital camera.  With regular cameras you can take pictures one after the other.  The digital camera has like a 10 second pause where it is writing the picture to the disk.  This can cause you to miss some good pictures.  It also chews up batteries at a good rate.  I�ve gone through a set of batteries already in just three weeks.  The only other problem I can see is the inconvenience of having to get pictures developed.  All of the options there are to get them developed seem really expensive.

Overall I suggest investing in one of these cameras.  You can email all your pictures to friends and family, put them on your web site or just keep them on your computer for your personal viewing.
