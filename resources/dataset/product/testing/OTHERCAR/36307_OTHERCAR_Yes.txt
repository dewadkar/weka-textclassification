            Beautiful sedan.  Even with the Acura TL at the 2.9% APR, I still went with the G35.  New body style, "Car of the year", high performance, 5 speed automatic transmission were all critical factors in my decision.  I am a little surprised that that the mileage is poor since it does have a 5 speed automatic.  The navigation is amazing.  You can enter a name of a business and it will pop up and get you there.  If all you have is the phone number, you can enter it into the system and it will display the business you are trying to get to and it will tell you how to get there.  Need a bank, restaurant, ice skating rink, golf course, it can quickly tell you where the closest ones are to your location.  The navigation system also will tell you your average MPG, Distance till empty (out of gas), latitude and longitude including elevation.  The biggest plus with the navigation is it is not integrated with the AC or radio which makes this car less intimating for others that may drive this car.  If you don't want to use the navigation, the screen hides into the center console. 

Another critical factor is the back seat space.  I take clients out and I need a back seat that can hold two 6 footers comfortably.  This car is perfect.  I got the sport package which I think most people should pass on.  It makes the ride rough, but you can take a turn at any speed without a problem.  0-60 in 6.1, you got to love this stat, the only problem is the manual recommends that you wait 1200 miles for a full throttle acceleration.  The manual does not want you to go over 4000 rpm until 1200 miles.  Most cars I believe have a 500 or 600 mile breakin.  My car is the 2003.5.  This is a mild version upgrade to the 2003 model they introduce early in 2002.  They have fixed many of the little bugs from the introduction model including a revised trunk that no longer has the rectangle with the words Infiniti on the back.  It looks cleaner in the back now.
