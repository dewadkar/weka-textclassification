            <i>Island #2 in our 3-week trip to Hawai&#146i found us on Kauai with our second rented car, the <b>2001 Chevrolet Metro LSi</b> We picked this car up at Alamo and thought we got a great deal through priceline.com at $145 for 6 days saving $25.</i> 

<b>The car&#146s features inside and outside:</b>

The Metro is considered a <b>sub-compact and one of the smallest cars available in the United States.</b> It is similar in size to the Hyundai Accent.

I admit the Subaru Impreza we rented in Maui spoiled me. Remembering the narrow winding roads and knowing that Kauai would be similar made getting into this Metro even worse than if it had been the first car we rented.

~Our car had 23,000 miles on it.
~an automatic transmission 
~a 79 horsepower, 4 cylinder, 1.3-liter engine. 

<b>It had</b> air conditioning, power steering, power door locks and an am/fm stereo radio. The inside was cloth and it was gray. Gray is the only option for interior cloth colors.  Our car was Silver Metallic. 

This Metro comes in other colors: 
Black Licorice
Dark Green Metallic
Scuba Blue Metallic	
Sunset Red Metallic	
White

The <b>seats</b> moved easily forward and backward which was nice but the seats did not lie as flat back as other cars in which I have been. In addition, <b>the handle</b> that moves the seat back was hard to get to. It was close to the door so I had to squeeze my hand down to get it.

There is really <b>nothing that is power(ful)</b> in this car.  

~The side mirrors have to be adjusted from an inside handle. 

~However the lights did come on when it gets dark automatically. 

<b>Space</b>: 

~The space in the <b>front</b> was fine. I had legroom and my husband&#146s head didn&#146t hit the ceiling. The <b>back,</b> which has 3 seat belts but is large enough for only 2 people. It  is also tight in leg space but I am finding few cars which are not considered full-sized or luxury cars that are really roomy in the back.

~It had <b>good storage space</b> inside including a center console with  room for items, 2 small cup holders, map holders on the doors and a change holder. 

~The <b>trunk</b> was spacious also. I will give specifications below from a website for those interested in measurements and numbers.

<b>The negatives:</b>

~I will start by sharing with you that I don&#146t consider myself a princess. We were on a budget and I am usually fine with budget cars. By the time we drove from Alamo to our villa I was literally in tears. <b>My back hurt me</b> because the seat was totally straight. There was little if any contour. 

~I was nauseous from being <b>jostled around.</b> I felt every single bump in the road. Every time my husband turned the car I went with it getting more and more carsick.

~It did stop when it was supposed to so that is a positive.

When we got inside our villa he was going to call Alamo to see if there was another car available for more money &#150 that&#146s how horrible I felt. After seeing all he was doing to appease me, I told him that if we changed our cars on the next two islands to more expensive ones, I would live with the Metro for the 5 days and 6 nights we were on Kauai. And that is what happened.

~This car had <b>no pick up.</b> It just barely got to 50 miles per hour.

~It was so <b>noisy</b> that although <b>I think the radio sounded fine,</b> it was really hard to hear it! 

~The automatic door locks, which are an option, didn&#146t work either. My husband actually agreed with me that he had made a mistake in going with the least expensive car.

<b>Warranty</b>

Basic: 3 yr. / 36,000 mi. 
Drivetrain: 3 yr. / 36,000 mi. 
Roadside: 3 yr. / 36,000 mi. 
Rust: 6 yr. / 100,000 mi. 

<b>My thoughts:</b>

When I went to the website I couldn't find the 2001 Metro there although I did find it on other websites as a resale. I wondered about that but asked one of the auto Category Leads to add it. He did and replied, "I'm a bit uneasy about this one because GM doesn't list the Metro as a Chevrolet model -- and Geo doesn't exist any more AFAIK. I'm guessing you either drove this in Hawaii (Asian distribution area) or Canada." He, of course, was correct - I did drive it in Hawai'i. I know we have readers from all over the world so I thought the car deserved to be reviewed. Luckily most of you may not have to encounter it or be confronted with wondering whether to buy it.

<b>Avoid this car at all costs. It is the worst car in which I have been.</b> Chevy considers the Hyundai Accent and the Kia Sephia its competitors in other years. My daughter has the Accent and I would urge you to buy the Accent over the Metro if that is the price range you are looking at.  

It does get good gas mileage at 30 mpg / 34 mpg but that is what my daughter&#146s car gets also. 

The average retail price of this used car is $7,425.
