            This review is for a mini cooper (not S) . Our MINI has 2000 miles on it now so I feel I know it well enough to review. This is a 2003 Mini I've read that the 02's had problems but ours has had no problems except occasionally it is difficult shifting into reverse.  The Mini is a little slow off the line and needs more throttle on take off than most people are used to but you quickly adjust to it. Once up to 2000 rpm the car becomes quick and surprisingly fast with smooth acceleration. The seats could be better the adjustments take some getting used to. I like the interior plastic and all especially when you consider the price of this car. There is an area of the dash above the gear shift that is missing for no apparent reason so I purchased a small storage accessory from a Mini supplier to fill in this area for coins and such. Also the Mini does not come with arm rest on either side so if your like me and use arm rests you will have to purchase them also. The purchase of arm rests made the interior comfortable for me. The rear seat although small is more comfortable than you would expect  we also purchased a boot mat from dealer for 35.00 .                                                         A small oversight by Mini is that there is no drip rails when it rains expect to get some on your lap when exiting the car.                                                           The window sticker on our car said 50%Great Britain , 20% Germany , and 5% U.S. /Canadian parts I'm not sure where the other 25% came from maybe I'm still missing 25% of car it is pretty small you know.                                                          I won't bore you with a long story about the handling and fun of the car except to say it's funnnnnnnnnnn and has to be experienced to be believed. At a little over 18 grand  you won't find another car this fun that gathers the attention of onlookers. We ordered the fog lights and spoiler and love how they look on the car.
