            A cut above the rest of the SUV's, the cream of the crop, the creme de la creme...I'm not sure if that's spelled right, but those just barely begin to give the Toyota 4Runner its dues.  It handles well, it's not oversized, looks very spiffy, and has some great and useful features.

Despite the occassional soft roll on some sharp turns this puppy handles like a benz.  Even for a big vehicle it stops on a dime.
And unlike some other suv's, the tire treads won't separate throwing your car into a ditch and killing you in a firey ball of twisted metal and broken glass.  Okay, that was a little bit of a scare tactic, but it's true.

The little things on the vehicle are great too.  The remote controlled back-windshield button lets you raise or lower the window if you need to stuff in groceries or if you picking the kids up from baseball practice and you need to shove their gear in the back.  And if you need to cover up some expensive equipment or keep things out of the sun, there's a little flap you can pull over the back to cover the space.  

One problem with the 4Runner is the height.  To climb in and out is something of a task, it's kind of awkward to climb way up then fall backdown into the driver's seat.  Otherwise I guess the only other complaint I can bring against the vehicle is the slightly cramped leg space in the back seat.  

Once you're in the driver seat though, cruising down the highway, music in the background, it's almost like flying.  It's a smooth ride, you can barely feel the bumps in the road when you're flying along.

All in all this is a great family vehicle.  Or if you don't have a family...it's a great macho SUV, you know, impress the chicks, then have a family to put in the car.  But if you're considering it, buy it!<br><br>
