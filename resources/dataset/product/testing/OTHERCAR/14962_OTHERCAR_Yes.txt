            I've had this model for about a year now, and I love it!  

The two features of this camera I like the most are:

o    10x optical zoom (note: &quot;optical&quot; means using magnification provided by the lens, like a binocular.  Much better than &quot;digital&quot; zoom, which uses software to enlarge the center portion of the display and is not as crisp.)

o    Use of 3 1/2&quot; diskettes for storage.  Each disk is like a roll of film in that sense, as each disk holds 16-20 pictures.  Having to swap memory sticks, or use special mini-disc drives or cables, to transfer your pictures to the computer is a pain!  However, with this camera you pull out the disk, put it in the drive, and voila!  There are your pictures!  Additionally, you can also copy disks using only the camera, enabling you to provide someone else a copy of your pictures right then and there.

I love the camera and use it frequently for taking snapshots of everything.  Some of the many uses my friends and I have found for this include:

o  taking snapshots of items to sell on eBay and other auction services

o  taking shots of heavy metal or machine parts, construction areas, etc., to use when showing a parts dealer/salesman exactly what part(s) you need to replace or need to finish the job

o  taking pictures of day outings and posting them to websites provided by hosts free of charge (e.g., 50megs.com, theglobe.com).  Beats getting a dozen reprints of conventional film and mailing them out to all your friends and family!

o  taking pictures in low-light situations (the camera is great for taking pictures using available light only with no flash--I took some great pictures of friends doing stand-up comedy on amateur night where a flash would have been disruptive.)

o  taking candid shots (the camera is very quiet--no shutter &quot;click&quot; like with a regular SLR--so you can take pictures without disturbing people around you--like of your friends playing blackjack in Vegas where security doesn't like you to take pictures!)

My only real complaints about the camera:

o  Max. resolution is 640x480.  Not a whole lot by today's standards.  Other models of the Mavica line do provide higher resolution, but, naturally, they cost more.  

That's not really a short-coming of the camera; rather it's a short-coming of my wallet since I couldn't afford a higher-end model at the time.  

o  Embedded disk drive might make the camera more vulnerable to moisture and dust.  I've not had any problems with the camera; however, I'm more careful to keep it out of any wet or dirty environments than I would with any other camera.

o  LCD display can be hard to see in bright sunlight.  Apparently there is a separate hood you can buy, though.

o  Flash can be overpowering.  I sometimes have to take flash shots several times to get a suitable picture that is not washed out by the flash.

I highly recommend the Mavica line based on my experience with this camera.<br><br>
