            This car is great for those of you who are looking for a low-cost vehicle that doesn't look or feel cheap.  It rides smooth and accelerates well, but steers a little stiff, and over 120 km / hour you notice how light the car really is.  

I've owned my Saturn for 7 years and have averaged 20,000 km per year with almost no major repair work.  For someone with minimal knowledge of car maintenance, it's easy to do the work yourself, and that's really all that's needed to keep this car running in good condition; my gas mileage has not changed in the years I've owned this car.

For all that is great about this car, I have two significant issues, the first being the lack of space in the backseat.  My Saturn is a four-door, but I have yet to find an adult who's truly comfortable in the back.  I also have great difficulty getting my infant in and out of the car seat (which was hard enough to install in the first place).

The second concern is with the polymer panels.  While this is a major selling point for the vehicle, it can also prove to be a source of great frustration.  The type of paint needed to flex with the panels is quite soft, and easily scratched by things like a snow brushes or the brushes at a car wash.  My car in particular is covered with swirl marks from brushing the snow off the roof.  As well, even though the panels do not dent, they do crack from even minor impact if it's cold enough outside.  Both my driver's side doors have thin hairline cracks several inches long.
