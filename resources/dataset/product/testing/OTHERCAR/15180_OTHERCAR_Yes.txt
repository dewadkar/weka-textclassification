            When we were shopping for a mini-van, we had a lot of input from friends. I have owned 2 Toyota Camry's and I was very satisfied with the quality Toyota provides. We did weigh input from others, but we really only looked seriously at the Sienna.   We were thrilled to see this van featured in many magazines for its safety, too. This van and my previous Toyota vehicles provide a smooth ride, exceptional dependability and a nice design. 

The interior of the Sienna is similar to that of other Toyota vehicles, with regard to the position of buttons, controls, etc. I was happy to see that an additional plug was added for cellular phones.  The design is clean and logical. I also love having the controls for the stereo on the steering wheel.  The seats are also very comfortable, we look forward to driving on two upcoming vacations. We had one rattle in the dashboard that was taken care of when we had our first (and free) oil change.

Since my husband likes to haul things, we were very satisfied with the ease of lowering and removing the seats when necessary. We also opted for 2 sliding doors, which has proven to be a wise option.  I wish I had opted for the remote controlled sliders.  I have small children to drop off at preschool and this would have made life easier.

We were given the road-side assistance package in our price, which adds to piece of mind.

The only things I don't like about the van are probably inherent to any van: it took some time to get used to backing up without feeling like I was going to hit something!  I received about 10-15 telephone calls from Toyota asking me how I liked the van. This was a big nuisance; if I had any concerns, I would have directed them to my salesperson.

This is a great van for families. We have been able to carpool with friends instead of taking 2 or 3 vehicles on day trips. I would recommend this van and Toyota to anyone wanting a quality vehicle.<br><br>
