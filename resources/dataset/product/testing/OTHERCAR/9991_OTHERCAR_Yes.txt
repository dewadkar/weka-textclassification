            After having trashed my Jeep Wrangler, then spending $500 a month to maintain an old Mustang, I thought it was time to buy a new car. The commercials, the $1,500 rebate, and the neat website won me over. I went to the dealer and didn't even haggle.

So yeah... my opinion is fairly biased. I love my car. It was something that fit into my budget and performs rather well. Now I can go to work and not have to deal with auto-headaches. If anything goes wrong, I just call roadside assistance. The dealer sold me an additional 3-year warranty. For a total of six years, I should have a problem free auto.

With the Kia Sephia's starting at $9,995 - I could finally afford a new car. That was my motivation - but if the car was lame, I wouldn't have bought it. The test drive blew me away. You don't expect an economy car to have extra power.

The stats are impressive, 125 horse power and 4-speed overdrive transmission - this car has got enough power to keep me happy! ...more speed than I need! (Although, you lose all your fuel economy at 85+ mph.)

Every day I drive to Manhattan and back with my Kia Sephia. I put about 45 miles a day on it. The used cars that I owned could not handle that kind of punishment and I can't afford to miss a day of work.

Everyone who's seen my car says it looks sharp. The spoiler really makes a difference. (The one I have is not the factory install, it lights up when the break light is on.) I bought it in Black. While I have to clean the car more often, it's worth it! I firmly believe Black is the sharpest looking color for a Sephia. The Black paint makes the Sephia look like it's worth so much more. The general consensus is - if I had rims, I'd have an awesome looking car. The tail lights have an attractive design too!

Whoa... and talk about roomy! I'm 6'2&quot; and I fit rather comfortably in the driver's seat. Sure my friends crack on me that I bought a Kia, but you don't hear them complaining when they're riding in the back seats.

Basically, when you go from a run-down old car to a brand new car, it's a good feeling. With my mustang - if it was quiet at a light, it meant it just stalled. So... the quiet ride of my brand new Sephia took some getting used to. While the professional car reviews I've seen say the car is noise, I totally disagree. Then again - I've usually got the radio blasting anyway, so who can tell? 

Filling the fuel tank only once a week also took some getting used to. The old Jeep needed gas every other day!

There is a serious problem with resale value though. The car depreciates in value rather quickly. Basically, I know that I'm going to be with my Sephia until I run it into the ground. So if you're concerned about price, wait until year end sales roll around, you can get a great deal on a Kia. I could have saved myself thousands of dollars had I waited until the end of the year. But then again... I would have missed out on six months of fun. 

The 2000 year model is virtually identical to the 1999 model. That made me feel good. Overall - I feel it's an excellent value for the money. If you're tired of putting up with your old car, you want an affordable second car, or you simply hate the bus stop, I highly recommend the Kia Sephia!!!<br><br>
