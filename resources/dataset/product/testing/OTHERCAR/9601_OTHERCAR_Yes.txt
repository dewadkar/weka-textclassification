            Granted I have had some bad luck with this getting into a wreck the day after I bought it, but there have been a few other things.

First problem was the belt tensioner had to be replaced and now I have a squeaky belt.  Second problem: I was highway driving and was going to downshift from 5th into 4th, but it accidently slid into 2nd and I blew the motor.  Toyota has acknowledged this as a problem because there was no resistance going into 2nd, so they are replacing the engine and putting a spring into the tranny to alleviate the problem.  This is where the good warrenty coverage comes in.  

Outside of these problems, I am STILL in love with this car.  I have been able to personalize it by putting some aftermarket stuff on it and upgrading the stereo.  Putting the back seats down has allowed me to move some rather large stuff in it like an 8' ladder (with the hatch closed) and I brought home a 32" TV in the box with this thing (hatch open).
