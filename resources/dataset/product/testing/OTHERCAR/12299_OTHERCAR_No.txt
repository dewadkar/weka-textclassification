            Every time I here the car rev up I get Chills.The completely re-designed Eclipse brings with it notable improvements in styling and features. The Eclipse is now available in three models: RS, GS and GT. Structural safety highlights include a larger front-bumper beam, high rigidity roof-to-floor B pillars, front and rear crumple zones and tubular steel side-impact door beams for all trim levels. Features that were optional last year are now standard such as air conditioning, power windows, compact disc player, a new engine immobilizer anti-theft and an air filtration system. Other options include the GS Sport and Sound Package, GT Sun and Sound Package and GT Premium Package. The Sportronic automatic transmission is only available for GS and GT models. <br><br>
