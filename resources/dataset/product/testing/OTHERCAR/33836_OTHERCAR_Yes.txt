            We needed a dependable family car, but I also wanted something fun to drive.  We looked at Camry, Maxima, and Accord.  The Honda was a great deal for the price.  We bought our 1993 Accord EX new and have had it ever since.  Our car has 4 doors, moonroof, 5-speed, nice stereo - most of the bells and whistles.  To date, I have only had to put tires and brakes on it.  There was only one significant repair - a new distributor assembly, but that was a recall item on this model.

My Honda has been all over the country from South Carolina to Georgia to Texas to Guam (yes all the way to the island of Guam) and back to Florida.  I have driven it cross country a couple of times.  I currently have about 110k on it and it still runs perfect.  I cannot say enough about the reliability of this car.  I would buy another one in a heartbeat - but I no need to since mine is still running great.

My only disappointment is the paint job.  It may be because of the warm climates that I have lived in but, just this year the paint has started to oxidize.  The oxidization is progressing fast.  First the hood, then the trunk, and next the roof.  I now have basketball sized oxidization spots on the hood, trunk and roof.  I am not ready to get rid of my car so I guess that I will have to get it painted soon.

As for the interior, I have cloth seats.  They have held up superbly.  They take a lot of abuse from the kids and dogs.  I still have the factory stereo and it still sounds great.  In addition, the ride is very smooth and quiet.  This is a good car for road trips.  The gas mileage is great (30+ on the highway).  It handles well on the highway and is very comfortable for those long days of driving.  And now for the fun.  I chose the 5-speed for its acceleration and pick-up.  This car is quite impressive for a sedan.  With the sunroof open and the stereo jumping, I sometimes forget that I am in a four door sedan.

This car is fun to drive, very reliable, and can take a beating (my kids and dogs can attest to that).  Yet, in the end, my Accord has yet to let me down.
