            You know, I've never quite understood why exactly it is people follow trends. Leisure suits and SUVs are two of the worse fads that come to my mind. My girlfriend owns a C5 Corvette for weekend driving, but like a million other Americans, she bought an Accord. While the Honda is a competent, lively, and reliable car (it's a '98 Model with over 170K mi, and I'd guess she's changed the oil only FIVE TIMES at most--it's dead reliable!), it is very, very vanilla!

We are both avid skiers/cyclists. I usually drive one of my Audi sedans to the basin, but when I had an unfortunate brush with a rock in my '01 A4 (I chalked it up to the fact that the car was--and still is--fitted with Z-rated tires), I decided that I was not going to risk taking such a sport oriented car through the ice. I had originally planned to trade the A4 in for an A6 2.7T, but the price to utility quotient was not good. I have plenty of fun cars, and I didn't need to pony up 50K just to have an excuse to get another one--you can probably tell by now that I am a complete truckophobe, and will avoid them at all costs. 

On my way home from a 20mile cycling trek through my city's back roads, I dropped by the local VW dealership, muddy and quite smelly. I eyeballed a great-looking black manual Passat, but I passed it up since it had the turbo and I knew there was a cool W8 option. I talked to a pesky dealer about a W8 with 4Motion, but was turned off by the fact that it only came with an automatic. A manual transmission is MANDATORY for me, so I didn't even look back, nor want to test drive the W8. Lithe black German cars just do something special for me, so I turned back to look at that lithe svelte little turbo model in the corner. I've read that the Passat was based on the same basic platform as the A4, and since every A4 I've had an experience with (including a '00 S4 and an '01 1.8T I own) has been indefatigably wonderful, the Passat had won major points with me already.  
 
I pleaded with a gorgeous blonde saleswoman to let me fire the baby up, even though my hair was plastered to my scalp with perspiration and more mud was visible than fabric on my jersey and shorts. Fortunately, she turned out to be an outdoorsy beauty, so she had no problem running inside to get me the keyfob. It was almost exactly like all the switchblade Audi ones--very cool. I hopped into the driver's seat: very supportive and nicely sculpted. Everything was in perfect reach, the cabin was airy?it was a pleasant place to be! The textures of all the materials were rich looking and substantial; they felt like they would last for a long time. The radio, climate controls, and window/sunroof controls were perfect! I loved this car, and I hadn't even fired the baby up yet! 

I inserted the unusual key into the ignition switch, and was greeted by a sweet and remarkably smooth and subdued idle--it wasn't wimpy though. I switched the A/C on, shut the doors, and (literally) within seconds it felt like a meat locker in there! Very good job, VW! Takeoff was smooth and predictable, and "effortless passing" would be an understatement. I topped 115mph on the interstate without hearing one bit of complaint from the dealer or (more importantly) the car. The punch from the tiny turbo four was amazing...180bhp from less than two liters?! I automatically assumed that because the car was heavier than my Audis equipped with the same exact engine (A4 with 170bhp, TT with 225bhp), it would be less responsive and possibly more sluggish. Wrong-o! The stability was amazing...my friend's M-B E-Class sedan didn't seem this stable at those speeds, but the suspension was a tad softer that I had hoped. By now I was sold, and I even got the dealer's number when we slowed to double digit speeds again!  

I got back to the showroom, ordered a factory authorized ski/bike rack combo, called my girlfriend to pick my bike up, and was done filling out the paperwork in a matter of minutes. The lot didn't have a car with both 4Motion and a stick, so I decided that a stick was just about as good with FWD in the powdery stuff. All I needed was a good set of snow tires... 
 
After three months of living with my new buddy, I am still ecstatic with the car and love to drive it. One weekend, I actually took it for a fast mountain drive instead of my Audi TT! I find myself continually amazed that this car is actually supposed to compete with the Accord, Camry, etc. The cars that play in that field are respectable in their own rights, but the Passat just seems to be playing on a much higher tier in terms of class, refinement, and image. One of the best things about owning this car is that you always secretly feel that you ripped the dealer off, 'cause it just doesn't seem like you should have paid so little! It feels and drives like a much more expensive car, and makes me truly believe that Volkswagen can successfully carry out its move upscale like it plans. Since it's September, and there is no snow now, I can't comment on it's performance in the cold stuff, but it has gone through the mud gracefully and up to my favorite bike trail several times. Friends actually like the back seat! My pals all whistled while I passed a stuck Jeep on my way up the trail...this car will NEVER be called a wimp! My girlfriend still insists that the tall blonde is the only reason I bought the car, but believe me, this is the first time in life I've ever looked at the car instead of a girl!

When marketing type geeks say UTILITY is important to active lifestyle twenty-somethings, they couldn't be more right. I'm 22, I'm active, and I love my Passat. This car is very compelling reason NOT to buy a truck, and another reason Audi/VW is the best carmaker in the world. SUVs are OVERKILL. Please, do us all a favor, and at least drive one! Trust me, you'll say Accord who? Camry who?
