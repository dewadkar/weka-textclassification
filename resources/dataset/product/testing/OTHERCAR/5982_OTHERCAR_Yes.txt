            The SUV competition is heating up with quality vehicles from a variety of manufacturers. And in this case, one can make a case that competition seriously exists within own family.

If you're shopping for a MDX, I have no doubt that you're also considering the Lexus RX330, Honda Pilot, Mercedes ML350, BMW X5, Lincoln Aviator and perhaps Nissan Murano.

Acura has been on a certifiable roll lately with brilliant use of recycled designs, a technique perfected by those guys at Toyota/Lexus. The Honda Accord yielded value-minded luxury Acuras such as the 3.2TL and 3.2CL. Now the Honda Odyssey platform has yielded superb vehicles such as Acura MDX and Honda Pilot. The practice of dressing up/down existing models for another market segment was first done to perfection with Camry/ES300 and RX300/Highlander.

The 2003 MDX boosted its engine output by 20 horsepowers for one main reason ... to differentiate from its cousin, the Honda Pilot. Is there a noticeable difference in acceleration? Not really. The car still feels heavy unless the gas pedal is floored. Do you really want to see that RPM jump to 4k or 5k everytime you leave the stop light? Of course not, that would be a terrible waste of gas! Then suffer the effects of sluggishness. One note about that though, the engine purrrs like a beautifully orchestrated symphony. Thus it tempts you to floor that baby more often than you should.

The interior suffers with poor ergonomics when you opt for the Navigation system. Like the TL, fan controls are integrated into the LCD screen when you have the Navigation package. I've said it before, this only SEEMS like a good idea. The tiny pathetic LCD screen buttons require too much aiming during driving. Another note on the interior, for some reason, the fake wood just seems fake! It looks like the same stuff on the TL's but for some reason, it just looks for solid on the TL. The result is cheap plastic look and feel in the interior console. I have to say though, the leather is much improved from the TL's. It actually feels like high quality stuff.

The fuel economy is listed as a downer but its really not MDX's fault. Can you name a SUV with awesome fuel economy? You can't. And the reason is simple, ITS A BIG CAR/TRUCK ! SUV's by its very definition requires it to be bigger and more capable than your traditional sedans. It has higher center of gravity, high drag coefficient, bigger engine, heavier body. But .... just because there are reasons for it having poor fuel economy doesn't excuse the fact that it DOES have poor fuel economy. The EPA rated the MDX at 17/24. Both will be difficult to achieve in anything but "ideal" environments. A more realistic number would be 15/22. But for a 3.5Liter, 260HP SUV, I'll take those numbers !

Now that I've finished complaining, the MDX does have a long list of value-minded attributes.

1. Seating for 7 with the 3rd row seats is rather hard to find these days.

2. Because its slightly wider than its competition, comfort level for 3 adults in the 2nd row seats is tolerable over long distances.

3. DVD navigation and ease of use is top notch in the industry.

4. Rear camera is a good addition especially since RX330 has it now.

5. New vehicle stability control is a welcome addition.

6. Rain sensing wipers as well as auto-headlights are luxury items that may appeal to some.

Now for the nit-picks:

1. Wish they had power trunk-lid.

2. HID headlights are standard on TL! C'mon! They should AT LEAST be an option here. Although there are rumors of thieves stealing those HID babies like there's no tomorrow since its standard on the TL's and TL's runs rampant.

3. Power tilt steering would be good. Not that I'm lazy to manually move that steering wheel once in every 3 or 4 years. But by having it powered, it can be moved out of the way automatically on entry and exit out of the vehicle.

On a final note. A lot of you will be pulling your hairs out deciding whether its gonna be a Honda Pilot or a MDX. Believe me, there's no wrong answer on that question. Pilot offers considerably superior value. Its cheaper, amenities are not short, seats more people (8 instead of 7). But the styling sure is ugly. You buy a MDX because it looks better and carries an Acura name and because you can afford it. If any of the 3 reasons do not compell you, by all means, go get a Pilot !
