            <b>The Vivitar 3500</b>

If you are looking for a digital camera to take pictures of family events and vacations, the Vivitar 3500 is the perfect camera for you. Mine came with 8MB of memory, which is over 50 pictures. And to think they sell the cards in 64MB! This camera is great for beginning digital photographers who want quality pictures and easy-to-use functions at the same time.

<b>The Goods</b>

The Vivitar 3500 comes with the camera, a carrying case, the serial cord, the power cord, and a video cord. The video cord connects from your camera to a VCR or television set's video port so you can give family slide shows from the 2" LCD screen to your television set (mine is 61" and the pictures were stunning).

<b>My Experiences</b>

I have dropped this camera on cement, tile, and wooden floors. It still is in just the shape as when I bought it. It's served a great deal for us. Christmas, at school, Thanksgiving, and vacations. It's great to be able to post these pictures on a homepage and to be able to email them to your family and friends instead of paying extra for double prints all the time. <i>Digital camera's can't and never will take the place of a 35mm camera.</i> Unless you wish to buy a 4 Megapixel digital camera and take up all of your computers memory will the large file sizes. Definately go with the 1.4MP. 

<b>I can't stand it!</b>

If you are looking for a digital camera with zoom, you are in no luck here. If you use the digital zoom you'll receive a blown up blurry picture. I had to buy a USB card reader because the 3500's serial connect's speed is slower than you can believe. And trying to change the quality of the image is hard so keep your manual ready.
