            Nice looking truck, still these domestic trucks are unreliable. I have a buddy with a 5.3 liter engine. I test drove it and wasn't impressed by it's power. Not quick enough for me. When i got out of the truck i discovered he was leaking transmission fluid.
This just showed me that this will be the last time I think ob buying a Silverado LS. Overpriced and cannot get any assistance from GM . Engine croaks at 19000 miles. Transmission leaks,Differential leaks . My friend is in a process of getting new motor. Will sell when completed and get a FOrd truck instead.
Even thought it is a good looking pickup, but has nothing but problems. Leaky windows, broken power window, broken seats, EGR valve problems, and now the rear leaf springs. You can just go down the list and find more and more problems with this truck.  Chevy has a long way to try to catch up to the king of pickups, the Fords.<br><br>
