            A friend of mine recently purchased one of these out-standing trucks. He purchased a standard cab, suspension package, sports model with the 4.7L V8 engine. 

This truck handles very well, and has some of the best acceleration I have ever seen. Dodge also offers a 5.9L V8 but there is no real reason to get that option because it only has 15 more horsepower than its smaller brother. If that 15 horsepower is a big deal then a good exhaust system will give back the lost horsepower and cost a lot less.

Loaded out with most of the options this truck will cost you right around $20,000 for a standard cab, around $23,000 for the extended cab, and about $25,000 for the new Quad Cab. These are just estimations that I have seen in the dealerships in my area and they may vary on where you live.

The Dakota also has a lot of room inside and out. I stand 6ft 4in and I have problems with leg room in most cars and trucks, but that is not the case with the Dakota. I had plenty of leg room on both the passenger and driver's side. The 6'6&quot; bed is great for carrying just about anything you could possible imagine and the powerful V8 can tow just about anything.<br><br>
