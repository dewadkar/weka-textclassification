            I used to want a samuri or a jeep, but at that time I was in a &quot;family car&quot;.  Well the daughter is grown, and I got this one for me.  I love it.  It has enough room to transport anything I might need, including her stuff back and forth from college each year.  (without having to worry about the rain). The insurance is not outrageous like a full sized SUV.

I would recommend it to anyone who wants a compromise between a truck, a car and a van.

Go Toyota.<br><br>
