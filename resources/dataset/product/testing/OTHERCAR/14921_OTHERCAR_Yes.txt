            I bought the Mavica in May of 1998.  I know they have improved their product and come out with new models since I bought mine - but I still am very happy with what I have.  I had looked at Digital cameras over a couple of years - purchasing and returning three different ones for various reasons.  When I saw the Mavica - I knew it was a winner!  There are two features that make it head and shoulders above the others, in my opinion.  First, the rechargeable battery, and secondly, being able to use 3.5&quot; floppy disks instead of expensive flash cards.  Also, you don't have to mess with cables or software to download the images to you computer.  Just remove the disk from the camera and insert it in the computer!  It couldn't be easier.

I know there are higher resolution cameras available - even from Sony now - but - higher resolution means more disk space and slower transmittal if you're sending pictures via email or placing them on a website.  The pictures I have printed have been fine - some even awesome - but if you want to be able to print out 8x10s without a grainy look, you probably need to look to the Sonys with higher resolution.<br><br>
