            I bought this car new in December 1993.  I loved the looks of it the first time I saw it.
Overall, this has been a pretty decent car.  I had to make several trips to the dealership after I first bought it to get minor adjustments made (chipped paint on driver's side door, sunroof not sealing properly, passenger side window not closing properly,and door seals replaced).  I finally got the &quot;little things&quot; fixed after going back to this dealership over and over, over the time frame of about 8 months.  Should I mention the name of the dealership?
After a few months more I started having trouble with the car at highway speed.  It seemed to surge and protest if I took my foot of the gas pedal.  I took it in again and the dealership replaced the spark plugs (replaced under warranty).  It seemed to do the trick.
I was very disappointed with the brakes.  Had them replaced after only 30,000 km of driving.  had them done again after about another 35,000 km.  I have about 114,000 km on her now and have had the brakes done once more in this time frame.  After the second brake fix I got them to upgrade the pads to carbon-metallic.  Big improvement.
Overall, I haven't had to do a lot of extra maintenance with this car.  The alternator went but it was replaced under warranty.  Also the thermostat needed to be replaced.  Also under warranty.
This was my first Chevy product after owning two Toyota's.  It had big shoes to fill.  It came up a little short, but hey, with all the extra features this Beretta has, I guess I can overlook some of it's faults.
I've had the car for almost seven years now.  I'm now trying to find out why, when it rains, I have a big puddle on the driver's side floor.  Might have something to do with the drain for the factory sunroof being blocked or disconnected.
I've taken this car on several long road trips and it is a pleasure to drive for long periods of time.  Very comfortable seats and great to have the air conditioning on hot summer days.
Every now and then I'm tempted to get rid of her but as I bought her new, and am kinda sentimental, I think I may just keep her for a few more years.<br><br>
