            The first few days the car was great fuel mileage was 60(+-). It is a Red GLS TDI Diesel with a sun roof, We purchased it with 8 miles on it. The diesel engine had a 
nice feel, like the older ones.
 
We live in the desert southwest. We are mid 40's. My husband is 6-4 and I am 4-11 and the seats fit both of us with a easy slide. Only Ice chest or small grandkids fit it the back.

My husband drives aprox 130 miles round trip to and fro on the interstate each day, was the final factor for the purchase.

After the signature the troubles began..!!
Before the 5000 "Free" Maint schedule. 

1. The fuel door would not open, dealer checked after every fill up. tried to pry open the fuel lid.. (hint have some one push the lid DOWN while you pull the release..) 
after many fitz.. the cable was replaced and no more problems.
   
2. The regulators that were replaced on BOTH doors had to be replaced a total of TWO times each. after one of the repairs they left my speaker braces out and then repaired that. leaving a loud rattling in the door.

3. Sun roof kept jumping the rails, this was changed 2 times, before warranty went out and once since (they paid for it after more loud fitz).

4. A few days after a oil change  the air conditioner quit working because the ground wire was crushed... hmm how did that happen under the protective padding and under pan. 

5. Then.. after the 20,000 mile "free" maint. the under pan was not put back on tight, on rear left side not at all... the pan was caught on pavement while going in reverse 
and front side of pan ripped at the screw hole.. they told me "Oh.. its only 150.00 to replace. it was not their fault, and not covered since it was "MY" neglect.

6. At time of purchase the back seat headrest was jammed on and would not release, THEY broke it and could not get a replacement.. until.. just about the time my warranty expired.. then "tried" to make me pay for it. VW did a good will repair.

7. Rattles.. Rattles and more. Sun roof still sucks air if it is open, not aligned right, they had to reorder the last parts several times.. They did not give me the air baffle 
back while waiting for the parts to come in, then tried to charge me for a new one. VW did another goodwill repair. 

Ok.. now we are at 55,000 miles..!! The check engine light comes on within 10 miles of leaving the dealership.. oops, they did it again..!! Now.. they say its the glow plug gizmo went out 300.00.. the next day, the light comes back on.. Oh.. its the wire harness only 45.00 this time. I tried to go to a well known shop in town.. they can only get the computer reading for the 1999 models, VW has not released it yet.

It is now a gutt-less wonder and the fuel milage has gone down to about 48-50. The dealership is now thinking that the turbo has/is - gone/going out of it.

BTW
A rabbit on the road WILL go threw the front grill and will take out a turn signal fixture. 200.00 and 45.00 for the turn signal. Our fault we paid.
Road kill no charge.
