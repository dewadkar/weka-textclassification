            I decided to buy this car as both my brother and my sister had Volkswagens before me and they recommended it. The day i walked in, i fell in love with this beautiful four door sedan that screamed, &quot;cute but not too showy.&quot; It being red also helped, of course! 
My car had everything, sixteen inch wheels, heated seats (very important! especially in Boston.),leather and luxury package. And all for only $19,000. The only thing missing was the CD-changer which i thought i could get for less outside. (hint: they are the same price everywhere, dealer or not, maybe the only difference was the labor charge.)
But soon my joy disappeared when i founded out there was a humming sound whenever i accelerated. It has only been a month since i bought the car.  Frustrated and irritated, i marched into the dealer's office and demanded to know what was wrong. They told me that there was something wrong with the transmission. This repair took at least two weeks. The part had to be shipped from Germany, they said. After 3 months, i received a letter telling me that there was something wrong with my car and i had to replace a part or it may cause serious head injury in the event of an accident. Oh boy, was i thrilled. Not to mention, the VR 6 engine was fast but gave me headaches. The engine seemed too powerful for such a small sedan. The trunk space which i initially thought was very useful was not really used THAT often. Perhaps more rear seat space would be more practical. There was also a lagtime between changing gears and the car tends to slid forward or backwards depending on whether you are in drive or reversing. I talked to other owners are they agreed that this was normal.It prevented rapid acceleration and a crunching sound was heard when you accidentally accelerate when it is still changing gears.<br><br>
