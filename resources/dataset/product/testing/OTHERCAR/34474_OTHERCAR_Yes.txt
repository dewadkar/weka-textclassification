            A Day Who?  That's what we said when we first heard the name. And that's what everybody keeps asking us even months after our purchase. Out of curiosity, we went to a dealership to see what these &quot;Daewoos&quot; looked like even though we had no intention of buying one. Two hours later, we were driving home in our new Daewoo Leganza. What impressed us the most was the classy &amp; elegant look for a very affordable price. The chrome grill, leather interior, standard CD player &amp; sun/moon roof won us over at first glance. This looked like a car that belonged to someone going somewhere in life.

During our test drive, we checked out its ability to maneuver through city traffic, tight u-turns &amp; acceleration power &amp; were convinced that it could keep up with our hectic lives. The power windows &amp; locks were a given but the spacious back seat &amp; even more spacious trunk were bonuses. The best part of all is that for as spacious &amp; roomy as the Leganza is, it still handled like a dream. Not only was the Leganza comfortable but the feel of the road was smoother than expected &amp; the road noise was greatly diminished. We knew that this was the car for us but could we afford it? YOU BET 'CHA!

Earlier that same day we had test drove a Toyota Camry, the vehicle we had been interested in purchasing next. However, the Daewoo had all the same features that we were looking for in the Camry but at $5,000 less. Several months later, we're still telling all our friends (&amp; strangers too!) how much we enjoy our Daewoo Leganza.<br><br>
