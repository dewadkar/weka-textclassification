            Hey, my grandpa's a pretty cool guy.  He may be 81, but he still likes to go cruising in his 1995 Pontiac Sunfire.  This car has kept him happy for a few years now with its reliability and great gas mileage, as well as its snazzy looks.  He always commented on the way it handled, and I was always tempted to try it myself.  Needless to say, when I got my license a couple of years ago, I jumped at the chance to take this car for a drive.

This car definitely offers a lot as far as cosmetic things go.  A pretty red with a smart tan cloth interior, it stands out among the crowd.  The Sunfire is very streamlined and compact looking on the outside, but has quite a bit of cabin space once inside.  It is comfortable for a long trip.  

I am probably most impressed with all the basic things this car offers.  Good pick up, nice breaking power, a good heating/cooling system, and a very smooth ride among other things.  It's also, as mentioned before, very good on gas; getting about 35 miles to the gallon.  As far as breaking down or major problems, this car is pretty well set as strong and reliable.  Pontiac has had a few recalls, but all were minor problems that were easily fixed by the dealer.  

All in all, I think that this car is worth the $15,000+ a little that was spent on it and I love every chance I get to drive it.  Fun and affordable, it's one of the best cars a grandpa or a granddaughter could have.  <br><br>
