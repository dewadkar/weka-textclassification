            As an owner of two previous Sentra SER models, the original 1991 and a the final year for the SER�s first incarnation, 1994, I was very interested when Nissan announced the new 2002 models. My first SER was a real bargain, an aztec red demonstrator with 1,200 miles on the odometer for about $12,500. That car was a revelation. As a qualified devotee of British sports cars (MG�s), I had bought into the notion that front wheel drive Japanese economy sedans could not possibly be as fun to drive as the good old 4 cylinder rear wheel drive European  sports cars. Boy, was I wrong. This thing was more like a motorcycle than a car. The all-aluminum, dual overhead cam, 4valve per cylinder, EFI engine was the smoothest, most trouble free and best sounding mechanical thing I had ever experienced, and I actually looked forward to every opportunity to drive the car. Winding it out to 7,500 rpm was always a sweet thing, although you could get yourself into a lot of trouble in third gear with this car. The �94 was the same, aztec red and just as reliable and exciting to drive. When it turned over 100,000 miles last year I began to think reluctantly about a replacement. What could be more logical than another Sentra SER? 

So in June 2002 I took possession of a new Sentra SER 5 speed, vibrant blue with only two options listed on the sticker, floor mats and in-cabin microfilter. The price before taxes and tags was $15,955, not quite $1000 more than what I paid for my �94. The new SER is very well equipped standard, with luxuries like power windows and remote keyless entry that were not even available on my previous SERs. Continuously variable intermittent wipers are also standard now, instead of the annoying fixed ones on the earlier models. Cruise control is also standard, as is an incredible 7 speaker CD/radio that will supply excellent sound with the windows down at 60 mph. My first two SER�s had the excellent power sunroof, which for some esoteric marketing or manufacturing reasons is not available in the standard SER with manual transmission (the sunroof is available on the Spec V model, which only comes with a 6 speed manual- go figure).

The new engine, a fully modern aluminum 2.5L 4 cylinder with continuously variable valve timing, variable intake volume, dual overhead cam, 4 valves per cylinder and EFI, produces 165 hp with a redline of 6200 rpm, more than 1000 rpm lower the venerable SR20DE powerplant. The new motor also incorporates a distributorless ignition and a single serpentine belt with tensioner for the accessories. As with the previous SER engine, the dual overhead cams are driven by an internal roller chain instead of the now-common cog belt. The owner�s manual and the maintenance schedule are not clear about valve adjustments on this engine. The SR20DE engine used hydraulic lifters, which of course never require adjustment. The 2002 maintenance schedule says that valve clearance need only be inspected if valve noise increases, and adjusted if required. No regular adjustment interval is specified. I suspect from looking at the cutaway drawings in the Nissan brochure that the QR25 engine uses bucket and shim valve adjustment. Owners who need to have this adjustment done will soon find that it is going to be a $300 to $500 hit to the wallet, more than compensating for the timing belt replacement that you will not need. I think that this is a backward step for Nissan, as the SR20DE engine proved that a high performance, high hp per liter motor could also be very maintenance free. The only engine work ever done on my previous SERs was routine oil and filter, spark plug and distributor and rotor changes. 

The new 2.5 is a torque monster compared to the 2.0, pulling very nicely up hills in 5th that would have required a downshift in the �94. It is also much more silent, lacking the entrancing motor music of the SR20DE. The net result of the 6,200 rpm redline and the reduced mechanical noise is that the new SER sounds like any other Sentra. You need to look at the speedometer rather than the tach to know that acceleration is taking place. This is a difficult thing to explain; either you get it or you don�t, and I thing Nissan�s engineers did not get it this time.

The other big issue with this car is the fuel requirement. My legacy Sentras used 87 octane with no problems, delivering 24+ MPG consistently and as much as 35 mpg on extended 70 mph trips. The owner�s manual for the 2002 is again unclear on this issue, stating that the 1.8L engine can use 87 and the SER Spec V must use 91, but somehow not mentioning the standard SER. I have emailed Nissan on this subject but have not yet received an answer. I will use 93 octane until know for sure, but I suspect that all QR25 engines will require high octane gas. I believe that this is something that should be clearly stated on the car�s sticker along with the Federal fuel consumption figures. It makes no sense to buy a car because it gets decent gas mileage and then discover that your savings are eaten up in the cost of higher octane gas. Another miss for Nissan.

The shifter on the original SER was a marvel, with short throws and a positive feel that made winding through the gears a pleasure rather than a chore. This is a remarkable engineering achievement on a front wheel drive car, as the linkage must be fairly long to reach up to the transmission, which is directly in front of the driver in these cars. The �91 to �94 cars had a single metal tube linkage, which provided a solid connection to the transmission. The new linkage utilizes two rather hefty cables instead of the metal tube. It could not be more �clunky�. It even makes a �clunk� noise when shifting from 1st to 2nd. The 1-2 shift is definitely the worst of the bunch, although the �91 through �94 linkage makes all shifts on the new one feel like a truck. In fact, I also own a 2001 Frontier pickup with a 5 speed, and this car shifts more like my truck than a sports car. What could Nissan have been thinking? To add to the mushy feel of the new shifter, Nissan has included the ubiquitous hydraulic clutch. The old clutch used a simple and easy to replace cable- why make it more complex than it needs to be? 

The brakes, 4 wheel power assisted disks, are very good and have a smooth, progressive feel. The wheels and rubber are larger, with 16 inch alloy and 195-55 series tires being standard. My car was delivered with Firestone mud and snow  tires. In my opinion, a performance car should be equipped with performance rubber, so this is another miss for Nissan, although one that can be corrected in about 40,000 miles. Suspension feel is solid and perhaps a bit harsh. The old Sentra SER used McPherson struts on all four wheels, a truly independent suspension. The front on the 2002 is Mcpherson, but the rear is the now Sentra standard double beam. 

The fit and finish on the 2002 SER is very good, as are the interior appointments. The 4-way adjustable driver�s seat and the 60/40 split folding rear seats are a nice addition, as are the very bright map lights. And this car, unlike the previous Sentra SER�s, is a 4 door.  Interior space is better, especially for the rear passengers, who now have their own window that opens. One disappointing omission is the folding outside rear view mirrors. The folding mirrors on my �91 and �94 models probably saved me (or my insurance company) hundreds of dollars over the 11 years that I drove these cars. The new mirrors are body color painted, but will probably be expensive to fix when they inevitably get busted off.

The new Sentra SER is a different car from the �91-�94 models. It is fast and comfortable, perhaps aimed more at the German small luxury car competitors (Passat and 325i) than at it�s own ancestry. The Spec V version may be pointed a bit more in the right direction, but the limited option range (only one interior color is available) will limit it�s appeal. The old Sentra SER was an exciting car to drive and reliable everyday transportation that was also economical, a combination that may have escaped the Nissan development team this time. For a 54 year old enthusiast soon to be a grandfather for the second time, this Sentra may not be a bad choice. The 4 door configuration and childproof rear door locks are good features if you must temper your desire for performance with a need for family accommodations, but you will pay a price in thrills. Consider the Spec V if you crave more performance, although I have not driven one and can�t vouch for the 6 speed shifter. Still, to get this kind of performance from the other manufacturers you will pay several thousand more dollars than the Sentra SER price tag, and the new SERs are assembled in Smyrna, TN, if patriotism is a factor in your decision. If Nissan reworks the shift linkage and installs an exhaust system with a little more growl, they might have a hit for 2003.
