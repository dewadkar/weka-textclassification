I bought my VW Passat about 18 months ago.  Since then, I have put over 20,000 miles on it so I know the car pretty darn well. 

When I was purchasing the vehicle, I compared it to the Accord, Camry, A4 and a Volvo.  

After careful consideration, it was obvious to me that this was the best choice.  The passat is probably the best car  for the money.  It is reasonably big (nice size trunk and back seat), stylish, powerful and fully featured.  It is awesome on the highway cruiser and very quiet (good if you spend a lot of time on the phone). 

It has some great features and similarities with the Audi A4 but you can save  $5-7,000 if you buy the Passat. 

Another great benefit of the car is the fantastic VW roadside service that comes with the purchase.   I have called twice for assistance(once a flat tire and once a dead battery) and it was very impressive.  I dialed an 800#, they had my record in the computer and sent someone to help me immediately.  The service reps were really nice and it was all free. Not bad, huh? 

My only complaints with the car are: 

1) the painted bumpers get scratched up very easily in city parking and 

2) there is a plastic engine guard in the front that is a pain in the neck during oil changes.  While dealing with the guard is a problem for the person doing the oil change, I found that twice, it was not re-installed properly after the change and it came free while I was driving.  This caused it to rub on the highway and had to be completely removed.  The cost to replace it was about $200 (I learned the hard way) to replace! 

The Passat really is a great car. I would buy it again tomorrow (fortunately I don't have to).
