            After a few months of owning my Legacy SUS, I have to say I'm impressed.  It drives like a dream, handles well, has plenty of pickup, and a smooth ride.  I bought it because I am new to New England and new to SNOW!  I have never driven in winter weather (being a west Coast gal) and wanted to get a car with all-wheel drive.  Still haven't seen the snow yet so I can't comment on the AWD, but everyone I've met tells me I bought a great car!  

Some of the things I like so far are the heated seats (heaven on cold mornings), the security system, the general heaviness of the car -- it's really solid.  The design is very comfortable -- You actually can fit two adults in the back seat and they can stretch their legs out.  It is a driver's car with all the controls within easy reach, comfortable seats that adjust for all heights, and is easy to handle in both city and freeway  driving.  For a car its size it has a lot of power.  When you are in it you feel safe.  I would recommend it to anyone.  Take one out for a test drive and you'll be sold!<br><br>
