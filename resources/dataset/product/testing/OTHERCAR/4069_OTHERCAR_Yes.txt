            After driving the Caravan, Windstar, and the Odyssey we ended up opting for the GM minivan trio.  After checking around and speaking to other owners, we found out the Ford is the safest, but that's the only thing it has going for it.  The Dodges we drove all had a transmission the slams into gear when you hit the gas (no wonder they end up with transmission problems) and the Honda has no give in their price on top of a three month waiting list to receive a vehicle that was about the same as the Chevy.

The seating arrangement makes long trips easier.  I have three children, so my oldest (8) sits in the front behind the driver.  This seat has the manual sliding door which she can open and it also has the rear air controls.  My middle (5 1/2) takes the back in a booster seat with the other rear seat folded down so he has a table to color on and a place to put his drink.  My youngest (3 1/2) sits in a car seat next to the passenger side door which has the motor drive.  The middle seat is folded down so the oldest and the youngest can share it.  They all have drink holders, places to put their coloring books and they are far enough apart that you don't hear the constant, &quot;He's touching me!&quot;

The acceleration is wonderful, but that is one of the reasons I like GM's.  When you hit the gas, you move.  My wife likes the overhead computer console, mainly the feature that tells you how many miles you can keep going before you need gas.  When we started looking, we were hoping to get a van without the automatic door, but after two months, a couple of rainstorms and a cold spell, we were wondering how we lived without it.  The only problem is that the kids fight over who gets to push the button.

A few bad points; the seat adjusting arm sticks way out and makes it hard to get comfortable in some positions.  Our driver seat is electronic so we don't have the problem there.  The windshield wipers can be annoying if you are just using the mist or a quick on.  They have to go from an off position to a ready position and then into action, then back to the ready before they house themselves.  The CD drawer is also clumsy and only holds a few cases, not nearly enough for a trip of over a couple of hours.  The automatic door is very powerful and a small child cannot stop the movement, so you must always make sure there is an adult with them as they get in or out to make sure another doesn't hit the button while little brother gets in.

We bought ours used in August and have taken trips from our Newport News, VA home to Washington DC (about three hours each way) and to Illinois (15 hours) and it has been great.

I would recommend this vehicle (or the Pontiac Montana/Oldsmobile Silhouette) to anyone who wants a quality vehicle for any reason.
