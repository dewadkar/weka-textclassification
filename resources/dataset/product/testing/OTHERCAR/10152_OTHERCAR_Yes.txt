            The Pathfinder is the solution for wannabe SUV owners who want to own an SUV but do not want to pay the premium demanded by their popularity. My experience is that you can get a really great deal on an top-rated SUV.   
I owned a 1997 Pathfinder before I leased a 2000 LE. Neither vehicle ever went to the shop for unscheduled maintenance. 
Although my experience with the dealer lacks much beyond oil changes, they have impressed me with their efficiency and speed.
The 240 hp engine is great. It's strong and smooth. A big and necessary improvement over the 167 hp slug in the 1997 vehicle.
The truck is very well balanced for an SUV. Not in the BMW X5 class, but it does seem to handle better than the usual SUV.
The Bose stereo is nice enough - not quite what I would expect of a Bose system, but given the various noises of cruising down the road, the Bose does fine. 

Now for the little quibbles...
The back doors are hard to navigate while getting in and out of the back seat. 
The radio controls are too small and hard to use. The readout is poorly placed and impossible to read. 
The overall storage is adequate but the little cubbyhole in the dashboard is too small to be of much use and lies hidden behind the shift lever.  
The temperature reading is notoriuosly inaccurate - not a big thing, but why put it in the car if it doesn't work.

Overall, the thing is not perfect, but it scores very high marks in the things that matter - dependable, reasonably priced, adequately powered, stable (for an SUV),
