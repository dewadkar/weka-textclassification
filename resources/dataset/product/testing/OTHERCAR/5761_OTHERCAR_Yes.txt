            If you are reading about Porsche, you probably know that these cars are not about transportation. Everyone who buys one has their own personal reasons. I wanted to have a reasonably reliable &quot;super sports car&quot;, and to that end I have not been disappointed. I have owned my 1991 Carrera 4 convertible since the spring of 1995, and I have no regrets. However the Carrera (the true Porsche) is not for everyone. The price of a used one from model years 1990 or later will push $40,000 in top condition, and a new one is over $75,000. The driving experience is truly unique - its all about performance and over-engineering, unlike Mercedes which is about over-engineering, quality and luxury. Owning a Porsche gives one a real understanding of the difference between &quot;quality&quot; and &quot;reliability&quot;. If you buy a used Carrera, drive a lot of them to make sure you are getting a tight, solid example. Yes, maintenance costs are high. I drove my C4 over 10,000 miles before I incurred any costs, but my first tune-up was $1000. But the satisfaction of ownership outweighs the maintenance costs if you can afford them. I'm not sure about the new water-cooled Carrera yet, I'll wait and see how well they are accepted before I buy a new one.
