            My cousin (among many other family members) has a Saturn, and has actually had the car in the family for 8 years.  This car still looks good and runs perfectly.  It has about 350,000 miles on it and the company (Saturn) offered to buy the car back from the owners (for $2,500) to use as a model for longetivity to prospective customers.  Of course, with a car that reliable, my cousin did not sell the car back.  Instead, he took it with him when he moved from Ohio to Oregon and the car is still going.

There are rumors that it is physically possible to make a car which lasts forever, but it the cost would be too much for the average consumer to bear.  But the fact that such an affordable car could last through that many miles would make anyone in my family a second, third, or even fourth-time buyer of the Saturn.<br><br>
