            Have you ever known people that were desperate to "get rick quick"? People that would do anything, go to any great lengths, just to get their hands on some cash? People that would lie, cheat or steal just to get that almighty dollar? Well, I suggest you make them happy and buy them a RCA CDS1005 digital camera. Tell them to just go out and take pictures of anything they see, the subject's don't really matter. Then instruct them to sell those pictures to the tabloids, claiming that they are pictures of Bigfoot, UFOs, or even some dead celebrity that people believe is still with us. The tabloids won't know the difference. They won't be able to tell that the picture which is supposedly of the Loch Ness Monster is actually a picture of a broken down taxi cab. That is how bad the quality of the pictures taken with that camera are.

Picture Quality:  Yes, all of that buildup and story was just a lengthy, drawn out way of saying that the RCA CDS1005 digital camera takes some incredibly lousy pictures. In fact, they are some of the worst pictures I have ever seen. This is the only camera I have ever seen that does not require the use of a photoshop to make the pictures appear to be stretched out of shape, distorted beyond belief, or just down right funny looking. Whenever you do find one picture out of the bunch that isn't too grainy or fuzzy looking, you can bet it will be too dark. If you used the flash, the picture will be too bright, no matter how far away or how how close you were to the subject. The only thing I still use this camera for is to take picture of items I am listing on Ebay (this could explain the sudden decrease in bids my items have been getting).

Zoom/Focus:  This camera has an amazing zoom/focusing mechanism: walk forward and backward until it looks half-way OK, then take the picture.

Camera Quality:  One shoddy piece of equipment, you can simply hold it in your hand and feel the "cheapness" ooze from it. I am amazed that I haven't broken it yet, or that it hasn't just fallen apart on it's own. I don't think the door to the battery compartment was put on right, it keeps popping open. I expected much better considering who made it.

Price:  OK, one of the two good things about this camera. This camera will set you back about $90-$100, depending on where you find it. I got mine free, so I guess I shouldn't complain all that much, but this is a pretty good price if this is your first digital camera or if this is a gift for one of your kids. For $100, I suppose this camera is alright, but if you want quality pictures, I suggest paying a little more.

Battery Life:  The second good thing. Since I don't take pictures all that often, naturally batteries will last me longer. If I use a higher quality battery, they will usually last me around four months, approx. 125 pictures (with flash), or maybe 200-250 without flash. I have found that Duracell works best, but that's just me.

Overall:  This camera would be a nice gift for a child, or for someone who isn't overly concerned with having the best looking photos. For these people, the price can't be beat. With it's lack of extras, this camera is simple to use, and equaly simple to get the pictures online. The addition of a good photoshop will add to your enjoyment of this camera, at least then you can claim you meant for the pictures to end up looking the way they do.
