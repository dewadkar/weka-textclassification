            My parents are really into buying cars.  Not long after they bought me my Passat, they decided that it was time to replace their 2 yr old Infiniti Q45 with a new car for my mother (we sold my dad's Buick - he got the Q45).  And after they spent a day in Atlanta, I returned home to find a new car.
But this was not just any car.  It was a Jaguar XJ8L, and it's an absolute dream.  After one of my friends was valet-parking at a horse race, he said that the Jag was undoubtably the best car there (other cars included new BMWs, Mercedes, etc.)  
Gold on the outside, I will admit I've never been a fan of the Jaguar body style.  But as they go, this one is beautiful.  It has a tan leather interior and a wooden steering wheel and dash board.  Because my dad always complains about a lack of leg room, we got the &quot;L&quot; series, which is 4 inches longer in the back seat.  Even my grandparents love to sit in the back.
I've driven it on a five-hour car trip, and it is a true driving car.  It is no Cadillac - you feel the road as you drive, and the car hugs the road.  I'm dying to see how fast it will go and still stay as smooth as it's been so far, but I can't seem to get it alone without my m car. other watching.  She loves her car.  The sound system is awesome, too, as one might expect.  The trunk is nice because, when loading luggage, you don't have to swing the luggage over anything (however, nothing compares to my Passat as far as storage room goes - most of the Jag is in the back seat).  Press the accelerator and drive, baby, because this is the car that was meant to be driven.<br><br>
