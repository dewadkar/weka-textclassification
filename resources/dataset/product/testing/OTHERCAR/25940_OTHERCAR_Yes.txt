            Early last year I was expecting our second child and trying to figure out how to get two car seats in the back of my extended-cab pickup.  My husband decided to check out the new Grand Am.  Am I ever glad he did!  We ended up buying a 4-door GT in bright red.  I love red cars!  Our two children fit just fine in the back without a hassle trying to get them in (like the pickup).  There is room for one other small person in the back seat, but they have to be small.  

I also love that my husband talked me into getting the GT over the SE.  We had previously owned a 1995 Grand Am SE which I also loved, but the GT is so much nicer.  I feel like I have a sports car even though it has 4 doors and 2 munchkins in the back.  

Starting in 1999 the Grand Am had many more safety features that it previously did not.  That was the clincher in deciding to buy it.  We live in a rural area with a lot of big trucks on the roads.  My husband feels safer with me and our children sharing the road with all those trucks in a car that is made with safety in mind.

We drove this car up to Denver for a vacation last summer (about a 6-8 hour drive, depending on the number of potty breaks needed) and thought it was very comfortable.  

I recommend this car to anyone, whether a mother toting around kiddos or a single man wanting a sporty car.<br><br>
