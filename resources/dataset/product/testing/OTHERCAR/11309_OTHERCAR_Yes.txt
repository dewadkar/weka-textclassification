            My parents bought this car in early 1990. Besides for regular service check-ups, it has only broke down once. I own the 240 DL model (station wagon), and while the styling isn't ideal, it looks cool in a retro 80's sort of way. It is sort of boxy, however the shape is very distinctive (as opposed to the generic sunfire and cavalier shape). Trust me, if you are picking somebody up, nobody will miss you!

Although it only has a 4 cylinder engine with 114 horsepower, I have found that it really moves. The 'kick down' feature (automatic transmission) of moving from fourth to third gear is really great for highway use. 
There is lot's of room in the front and trunk, though I find the back a little cramped. Being over 6 feet, I have the drivers seat all the way back, so adult rear seat adult riders will be cramped. Children are fine however.

When driving alone, the acceleration and handling is decent. However, with three adults in the back, acceleration is sluggish and the car feels weighed down. 

It has a nice quiet ride, and has the best mileage I have ever seen. <br><br>
