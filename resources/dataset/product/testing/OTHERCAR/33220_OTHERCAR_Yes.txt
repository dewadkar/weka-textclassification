            Just recently I reviewed my 1996 Honda Civic and I was singing it's praises. Well although those sentiments are still true there is a new kid on my block. Due to some strange financing tricks that my dealer pulled (that I still don't fully understand) I was able to move from the Civic to a 1997 Accord LX-V6. I am so glad I did. Again I am not taking anything away from the Civic but the Accord is definitely worth the extra money. 
	The V-6 is so powerful and responsive. Maybe too powerful, because I almost got a speeding ticket on my first stint on the open lanes of Interstate 95. The handling is also very tight as one would expect from such a quality car. 
	The ride is quieter than the Civic's and the space advantage is obvious and appreciated. The seats are very comfortable and I like the cool 
electronic adjust on the driver's side. Even though summer is over, I checked the AC and it gets cold very fast. That's about all I need to tell you about this car but if you get a chance to drive one see for yourself. 
	I look at this as an investment because I know that I will be riding in comfort for years to come,
