            We bought this car used this past March 2000 and it is a wonderful car.  We spent very little to purchase the car and practically nothing in getting it in the proper working order, (the previous owner did not bother to get a proper diagnosis, so we got a really good deal).  There is one thing about this car that kind of is annoying and that is at stops while the car is in idling it vibrates.  When we first got the car it was bad but it actually doesn't do it anymore?  I have no idea why, this was a common Saturn problem they had with the first year cars they came out with and it has to do with the motor mounts.

This car gets really good gas mileage, and is very roomy front and back.  Other than that for being almost ten years old it is in wonderful condition and currently has 100,000 miles on it and will go a lot more.  We made this purchase almost two years after we purchased our brand new 1998 SC2 which now has 91,000 miles on it.<br><br>
