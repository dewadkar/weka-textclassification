            We purchased a used 1997 Buick Skylark in the fall of 1998.  The car had approximately 30,000 miles on it when we bought it.  It has been a wonderful car.  This car drives very well.  The road is always smooth when driving this car.  

The accessories holder in the center of the front seat is wonderful.  There are two drink holders, CD or tape holders, etc.  There's even room for my cell phone cords when I'm not using them.  

We did have problems with one of the air conditioning vents breaking, but that's the only problem we've had with this car.  

It gets great gas mileage.  We drive approximately 600 miles per week and we only have to fill up our car once per week with gas.  

My husband and I didn't have any children when we bought this car so it was the perfect size for us.  The trunk was large and we could fit luggage, etc. in it when we went somewhere.  

Now that we have a baby, the car is more of a tight fit.  I can't get my daughter's stroller in and out of the trunk.  

I sit in the backseat with my daughter when my hubby is driving and my legs are scrunched up.  

This car is perfect for a husband and wife with people only occasionally riding in the back seat.  If you have a family though, you'll be having a tight fit when sitting in the back seat.<br><br>
