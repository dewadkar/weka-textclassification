            I bought this vehicle not long after I totalled a 95 Geo Metro with slightly squishy brakes.  I have to say from the moment I drove my little Scoshi (little one) I was in love!!!  I love that the average gas mileage I get from this car is only about 3 MPG less than the Metro with double the horsepower and far more stable handling.  I also like the location of the speedometer and instrumentation.  The panel's location off to one side makes it very easy to monitor your speed as you check your mirrors, since the panel is right on the visual path from the driver's side mirror to the rearview mirror.  I also love that you can fit this car into tiny parking spaces with a lot of room to spare.  The ride is also very quiet, aside from occasional road noise on rough pavement.  It's even sometimes tough to hear when to switch gears!

One minor thing that still kind of annoys me after owning this car is the difficulty in locating first gear after shifting into neutral at a stoplight, due to the oddness of the shifting pattern in the manual transmission (I have the two door coupe).

My own little Echo, in a pretty light blue, has elicited many compliments, from young and old alike, despite a lot of the nasty reviews it's gotten for its design. &lt;--- This tends also to be from those who still love the scary recent Ford designs, so I'm taking it with more than just a grain of salt :-)  The amount of interior space is quite impressive, especially considering how small the exterior frame appears to be.  I have tons of room for stashing stuff, especially in the surprisingly large trunk.  My other rebuttal to some of the criticism I've read in regard to the &quot;sluggishness&quot; of the engine is that I find myself being able to accelerate quite well uphill on the local hilly freeways, and several times have caught myself doing 85 MPH with just a slight tap of the gas pedal.  However, I guess that the difference might be that I don't have an automatic transmission.

I think this car is ideal for students, single people, and young married couples who might not have a lot of cash.  It would also make a great commuter vehicle, due to its great fuel efficiency.  It's very economical to run, and the warranty and optional extended package of free maintenance for three years make it a very hassle free vehicle for a busy individual.  &lt;--My own extended warranty plus maintenance package includes a 6 year bumper to bumper warranty, three years of &quot;free&quot; oil changes, plus &quot;gap coverage&quot; which, if the car is ever totalled, pays both the deductible and the difference between the payment from the insurance company and the remaining balance due Toyota.  On the average, a tank of gas lasts me about two weeks, including a lot of weekend driving (I take the local rail service to work every day), and costs only about $20.00 to fill up the tank at about $1.85 a gallon.

This car probably would not be a good bet for anyone with a complex about driving a small car, especially those with a frightening lust for SUV's.  Also, a family with more than one child would not be able to fit into the car, which is quite a drawback, unless one parent needs an efficient commuter or errand-running vehicle.

Overall, I wouldn't trade my little Scoshi for anything!  He's my baby :-)
