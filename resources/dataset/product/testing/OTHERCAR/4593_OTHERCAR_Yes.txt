            I hate minivans.  Always have.  Thought I always would.  Had a set of twins.  Joined the league of minivan drivers.  Never happier.

I chose the new Sienna after test driving the Chrysler/Dodge offerings, the Honda Odyssey, and the Mazda MPV.  

It had the best of the gizmos and gadgets found on the others, and then some.  People stare in disbelief in parking lots when I open AND CLOSE the two sliding doors AND the hatch with a push of a botton (on the fob and in the car).  The second seat passenger winodws roll down.  Apparentlly this is unique to the Sienna.  I had no idea.  Built in sun shades on all back windows are nice.  Repositionable eats require some effort.  Once you move them you probably will not reposition them though.  The third seat is fantastic.

Opted for the XLE non-LTD edition.  Leather everywhere.  Very good workmanship.  Drives smoothly both in town and on the highway.  Third row seats fold completely away and pup up with minimum effort (my 10 year old neighbor could do it).
