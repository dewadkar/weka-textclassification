            We bought this SUV after comparing options with comparable SUVs like the 4runner. We love our Nissan Sentra, so felt confident buying another Nissan. We did some research and found that the 1999.5 Pathfinder had the things we wanted. Lots of cargo room (85 cubic ft), but not huge looking exterior, a real 4WD system with low-range gearing, comfortable seats, and ready for off-road use.

The power is adequate for us. The engine is 170hp, and we do not tow anything, so it is perfectly fine. Sometimes going up a steep incline, however, the Pathfinder loses power. The newer 2001 models have the 240hp engine, at the same fuel efficiency (at least that what it is rated at). 

Driving is really fun in this SUV. The handling is great, and steering is precise. The engine is a little noisy at low speed acceleration, but while cruising is quiet. One little quirk is the cruise control. When going up an incline, the transmission will downshift to get more power, but when at the top of the hill, it will keep in the gear for too long, and rev higher and higher, then finally shift while creating quite a jerky motion. I have found myself cancelling the cruise control at the top of hills, then re-engaging. The 4WD system is easy to use. You can engage 4WD high-range anytime under 50mph. We drove 25 miles down Padre Island on the sand, and the Pathfinder was holding its own with ease. The ground clearance is not as great as other SUV's or 4WD trucks, but you can add larger tires to get an inch or so more if needed. I used to own a Toyota 4X4 truck (manual) and loved it going off-road. The automatic SE pathfinder was a nice surprise in 4WD. By using it in gear 1 and 2, you can get a lot of control.

The interior is simple, nothing fancy. All the buttons and controls for A/C are easy to figure out, and the air cools the cabin down very quickly, even in the Texas summers. The driver's seat is power adjustable in the height department, both front of the seat and rear of the seat, and also forward/back. One thing that is lacking is a memory setting for the driver's seat. Not an issue since my wife and I are about the same size, but may be a consideration for you. The rear seats also recline, which is great for passengers. The Bose sound system is awesome. One of the best sounding systems I have heard. The bass is amazing! A definite option you should go for.

What I love most is the cargo room. Flipping down the rear seats is easy and quick. There are plenty of hooks to tie things down, and a cargo net is included. That comes in real handy for groceries. You can also get an optional interior bike rack (just like is touted on the XTerra). I keep a tarp in the back, and use it when I have to haul Soil and mulch from the nursery back home.

Why did I choose this over the 4runner? The 4runner is a little harder to get in/out of because it is higher. I don't mind, but it would be harder for my wife. Also, I have been happy with the service of Nissan dealerships in general. Also, it seems that everyone around here has a 4runner! :P Nissan makes great vehicles. I am sure that my next car will also be a Nissan.

All in all, a solid SUV, with lots of options included. I would, however get the newer model, which can be had at the same price, or even less, with more options, including 6 CD in-dash changer and MUCH more powerful engine. (My brother bought a 2001 LS model for cheaper than my older SE). But, if you can get the 1999.5 model used, and don't need the extra power, go for it. (Not mine, though, I plan to keep it for many years to come!)<br><br>
