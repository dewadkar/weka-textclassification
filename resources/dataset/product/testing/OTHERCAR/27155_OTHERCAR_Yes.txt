            I purchased my current 1998 Chevrolet Astro LS passenger van new in the spring of that year.  I must say that my experience with the vehicle have been very positive.  My van currently has about 55,000 miles on it and has never required any repairs of any type, only routine maintenance (oil changes and tire rotations).  The Vortec 4.3 liter V6 provides effortless power and always delivers fuel mileage in excess of 21 mpg.  The interior of the van, with its' four captains chairs and rear bench seat comfortably seats 7, although six people are a bit more comfortable.  The seats provide exceptional comfort for extended trips.  This is the second Astro van that I have owned.  My previous van, a 1995 model, delivered 185,000 completely troublefree miles.  All that was required on the 1995 was a battery, fan belt, brakes, and tires.  I use this vehicle for business extensively, and the easily removed third seats provides for a large cargo area.  In my opinion, these vans are among the most well-built and troublefree vehicles on the road.<br><br>
