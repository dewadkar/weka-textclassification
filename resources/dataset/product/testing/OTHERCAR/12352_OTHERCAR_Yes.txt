            I have always liked Fuji digital cameras (previously owned the Finepix 1300 & 2300).  The colors looked more realistic onced printed out (on the Canon S820 or Epson printers).  That is still true with the F700.  Even when compared with the prints from the Sony Cybershot f717 or DSC-P72, I prefer the Fuji.  Although the 5 & 3 megapixel Sony produces sharper pics, the colors just aren't as alive as with the Fuji (without having to manipulate it in Photoshop).  

The highly raved about SR Technology is apparent when taking high contrast pics.  Even though I think it compromises the sharpness of the pictures, edges specifically, I still think it is worth having especially since most of my shots are taken indoors or when it's not sunny outside.  At least I'm still able to capture the details of bright faces and dim backgrounds or faces.  With the 2 Sonys, a Sharp (3 megapixel), and also some other friends' cameras, they were indeed sharper but usually lacked the skin tone colors.  Since I only am printing 4X6 prints right now, sharpness is not a really factor.  You can not really tell unless you zoom in and look for blurred edges.  You will notice, it picks up the normally dark faces in the background.  

Because I have 3 kids, the quick startup time, short shutter lag, & quick shot to shot times is very useful.  With the other cameras, by the time the camera was ready, the candid moment would be over. With this, I can take shots very quickly and choose the best ones later.  Also, I do have a Sony DV camcorder, but obviously don't take it everywhere.  With the F700, provided the light is bright, the video & sound captured is perfect.  It's 30fps so it's smooth as regular video but sharper than my old Sony 8mm video, again provided there is bright lighting.

The controls seem very logical and easy to use.  The screen is very bright even outdoors.

Although I prefer using AA or AAA batteries like in my previous cameras, I understand Fuji had to go to lithium to get this small.  It's okay since I already bought 2 extras for cheap.
