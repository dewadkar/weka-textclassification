            This review is part of a write-off in honor of my friend, Mike (Roadiem).  My heart broke when I heard that Mike had passed as he was a kind and caring member of Epinions � I will miss him sorely.   I would like to thank Wolfman309 for putting together this write-off.  All proceeds earned from this review will be donated to Mike�s family, whom he loved dearly.  My heart goes out to them.  

<b>Geo Prizm</b>

I purchased this 1993 Geo Prizm last year for my son after doing a lot of research on the different kinds of used cars.  I wanted to get him a car that would last him through college and would also be within my budget.  We found this Prizm on a used car lot for only $3500.  I wrote down the Vehicle Identification Number and came back home to run it through the Car Fax web site.  Car Fax indicated no problems with this car and it appeared to have only changed hands one time.  

We both liked the car, which was a miracle in itself.   We liked the car for the same reasons.  Ah yes, there was no generation gap here.  Let me explain.

<b>My Reasons for Liking the Prizm</b>

The reason I decided on the Geo Prizm was because I had heard that a Toyota engine was being used in this American-made car.  I like the Toyota automobiles because they are always rated so high in the Consumer Reports magazine.  My dad had a Toyota truck for years and loved it.  It never gave him one moment�s problem.   So I knew the engine (with proper maintenance) would last much longer than any American-made used cars on the market.  I figured it should last well over 200,000 miles.  The Prizm that we were looking at had 104,000 miles on it and if he just drives to school and around town it should last him through college.

The car had an automatic transmission.  There would be no juggling clutch/brake/accelerator as he is trying to pull away from a hilly intersection.  Also no peeling-off stunts trying to impress his friends.   

 The body of the car seemed sturdy and strong � another plus for protecting my little treasure as he is out and about, driving along on the road(iem).   Along with a reputable engine and a sturdy body, this car also had a driver�s side airbag.  I believe that in 1993 it was a law for all cars to have the airbag, but I was glad to find this model car within my budget.   

The car had a sunroof.  I have always wanted a car with a sunroof and never splurged on that option.  The Geo Prizm that we were looking at had this sunroof and it actually worked.  There is a small button on the ceiling of the car that you push and the sunroof automatically opens or shuts.  Now since my little Mr. No-Up-or-Down is going to college in the Sunshine state, he can open the sunroof and let the sun shine on his face.  (I am beginning to think �Give him your car and you keep this one� � hehe.)

When I was looking at the car engine, I was looking for yellow writing on any of the parts inside of it.  I learned from reading another review in Epinions that yellow writing on a part means that the part came from a car graveyard. If there are a lot of parts in one area that have this yellow writing, you can just about bet that the car was wrecked and the parts were replaced/rebuilt from junkyard parts.  There were no yellow scribbles on any of the parts within the engine. 

The trunk is huge.  He would need a big trunk to carry his belongings off to college.  This trunk would do as it would hold several suitcases or boxes of his junk�I mean his belongings.

Gas mileage on the Geo Prizm is also good.  He gets 22 to 26 miles per gallon around town.  Since we haven�t taken it on the road(iem) yet, we are not sure what gas mileage it will get traveling.  But we will find out this fall when he heads off to school.

The car has 4 doors.  It will be easier for him to load and unload his books or bags for school.  It will also be easier to clean and vacuum than the 2 door cars.

The radio was broken.  I liked that because he would have less distraction as he is driving.  I know I am a stinker but he needs to concentrate on the his driving not rocking out.

Yes, this little Geo Prizm is the car made especially for my son.  I could tell by looking at his eyes that he liked it too.

<b>His Reasons For Liking the Prizm � Same but Different</b>

 It has an engine that runs.  It will drive him away from the house and away from his nagging mother saying things like <I>�Remember it is not a toy�..Buckle your seat belt, it�s the LAW�..always wear your glasses�</I>�.yadayadayada.  Yes the engine will go in reverse and back him out of the driveway away from all of that.

The automatic transmission is great.  He can lay the seat way back and use the tops of the telephone poles as his guide to see which way the road turns, prop one arm on the back window, and drive with one finger on the wheel.  

The car has an airbag so if he forgets to buckle up he will still live if he wrecks the car.   (Remember this is a 17 year old way of thinking, not mine�.I have lectured and lectured about this.  Buckle UP!  Buckle UP!  They think I am mental.)

The car has a sunroof.   He and his �dogs� can pop out of the top when they see a good-looking babe walking down the beach and �holla� at her.  

The trunk is <b>huge</b>.  It will hold an enormous bass speaker and the whole town will hear his beat. 

Good gas mileage.  He can pop over the bridge to Clearwater beach and back several times a week on one tank of gas.  As long as there are enough gas fumes left in the car, he can make it to his classes.

The car has 4 doors.  He won�t have to get out of the car or squish up against the dash to let all of his home boys out of the car.  

The radio is broken.  He doesn�t want a weak radio anyway.  He will replace it with a CD player/receiver and add an amplifier so he can drum up the bass in his huge trunk. 


We have had this car now for 6 months.  These are the things we have had to replace on it.

1. The wheel bearings.  This was no cheap thing to replace.  The car started making this loud �clack clack clack� noise around the wheels.   We took it up to Big 10 tires and they said it was the wheel bearings.  The cost was about $400 to get that replaced.

2. The battery.  This was a minor thing that I expected to have to replace.

3. The engine.  Yes, I am not joking.  We had to replace the engine on the car.  After all that research and Car Faxing to make sure we were getting a decent car, the engine wound out having to be replaced.   It  was making a weird noise one night.  I asked my son to check the oil.  We checked it and it was about one quart low.  We added a quart.  The next day my son was on a delivery for his job and the engine just locked up and quit.  Our mechanic said that the oil pump may have gone out - but the engine light did not indicate that the engine was overheating or anything.  The car just died.  The only thing we could do was to replace the engine.  

We found another 93 Geo Prizm engine and had it put in the car.  The total cost of this was $1050.  We have a 90-day warranty on this engine.   It has been in the car for almost a month now and is working great.
My son no longer has to be reminded to check the fluid levels in his car.  He is very diligent about this now.  

I am still very happy with the Geo Prizm even though we had these problems.  I think the problems stemmed from the previous owner not servicing or taking proper care of the engine.  The Prism is a sturdy, safe little vehicle and is perfect for my son.

Yes, he did fill up the trunk with a big speaker and now has his CD receiver in place of that �weak� radio.  He has a Sony Xplod CD receiver (which I have been waiting for Epinions to add this to their products so that I can review it.  It is awfully neat) and he had that installed just before the breakdown. 

 I even like the new sound system in the car because I can hear him coming home as he turns the corner at the end of the street.  I know it is him because he always turns the volume low as he nears the house, thinking I won�t hear the music and start my bock-bock-bocking all over again.

Well, now you see that even though the reasons for liking the Geo Prizm were the same for both of us, they were different at the same time.  Maybe there <I>is</I> a bit of a generation gap here?
