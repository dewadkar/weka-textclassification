            Well I drove my last cavalier (a 92 model) into the back of a truck, so it was time to get another car. thought I would try a Subaru, but they were a little pricey. while on the lot I spotted a 96 cavalier of bright Blue. Having been so lucky with my first cavalier I thought it was a good choice and took my new (used) car home.

First lets mention that this model is a few feet shorter than my 92 and there for has less room than I was used to. Lucky for me that I'm not tall,(5'7)not much head room.

Now the good stuff. The gas mileage has been improved,I get about 32 miles to the gallon on mostly in town driving. the seats are still very comfortable. I have a 5 speed manual transmission that makes this car a blast to drive. I can get to 60 faster than most. It loves curvy roads. Just a little 2.0 engine but it has more than enough zip. It came with a more than acceptable stereo system. This one seems to have inherited its ancestor's dependability, I have yet to have any problems with it. the last thing that is a major improvement is the two airbags that help me to feel a little safer.

I miss my old cavalier but this one is a wonderful evolution and as long as they keep making this good I'll keep buying them.
