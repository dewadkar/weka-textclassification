            I looked at various makes and styles of Vans before purchasing a 1999 Plymouth Expresso. I decided on the Plymouth Expresso because it has all the features that I was looking for and I found in shopping for Vans,  it was hard to get everything you want in one van without paying a lot of extra charges.  This van is very very comfortable, it drives like a car, where is some van's I found they were like driving a truck or a sport utility vehicle, and I wanted something with a smooth drive. There is a lot of space with the four bucket seats and one bench seat. Extra drink holders with lots of different storage areas and also grocery bag holders in the back.  If I were to buy another I would invest in the voyager for that extra room behind the seat, I seem to fill it up quickly and really could use the extra space.  Gas mileage is great, a tank lasts me a week and I drive 40 miles round trip to work each day! I would highly recommend the Plymouth Expresso to anyone searching for a van, the price is right, the accessory's are there and if comfort and smooth driving is what your looking for this is the direction to go!<br><br>
