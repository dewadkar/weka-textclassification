            My Neon is a 95 that I bought used in 96.  It now has about 38,000 miles on it and all I have done is put 2 new tires on and replaced the battery.  I live in Minnesota and this car starts right up even in extreme cold -- even after sitting directly outside for 8 hours!

For a small car, this car is roomy!  I have driven it for 4 hours straight and was completely comfortable.  Mine doesn't have cruise, but my leg didn't even ache from pushing on the gas for that long.

The seatbelt is really comfortable -- and adjustable for however tall you sit in the seat.  

Mine just has the basic radio (no CD player or Cassette) but the sound is good and it has fine reception.

I wish the glove box was just a bit deeper.  The console between the seats is roomy with a place for cassette tapes if needed.  There are also two pop holders -- they will only hold cans of pop or Fast food pop that is Large or smaller.  Even the large ones are kinda risky -- if you take a corner too sharp, they tend to topple out.  The could be made deeper to prevent this problem.

The trunk is very roomy -- and really really roomy when the back seats are flipped down.

Overall I love my Neon!<br><br>
