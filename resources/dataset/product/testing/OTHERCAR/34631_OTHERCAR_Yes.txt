            Five years ago, I would have never dreamed I'd have my Impala SS setting outside, and a brand new minivan sitting in the garage. We were going to be different, the ones who resisted. One horrible Dodge Neon and one beautiful son later, here it is, our very own mom-mobile.

I did put up a pretty good fight. I wanted something a little sportier, something that handled like a car. I was pushing for a wagon or for waiting until the PT Cruiser came out. If it was space that we needed, why not go all the way and get a Suburban? But, nice wagons are scarce these days, the Suburbans are WAY overpriced, and, well, we needed to get rid of that Neon so the PT Cruiser had to go.

So, we started shopping the GM minivans. My father works for GM, and the GM minivans seem to be pretty reasonable as far as pricing goes anyway, so we pretty well decided that if we were going minivan, we'd go the GM way.

We started at the Chevy dealer. The Venture looked like a nice van. We took one out for a spin: it was a little soft in the handling department, but it wasn't nearly as bad as I had expected. My parents had a late-80s Astro van, and there was simply no comparison. The ride was at least as controlled as a big sedan, and acceleration was adequate, if not overwhelming. I miss the torque of the big 4.3L engine in the Astro, but this motor more than makes up for it in smoothness and top-end power delivery. The transmission is, of course, nearly perfect, in typical GM fashion.

What kind of turned us off on the Venture was, believe it or not, the exterior treatment. All of that matte black stick-on plastic stuff just looked cheap. And there's no excuse for looking cheap on a $30K van. Also, there just happened to be a Pontiac dealer next door, and prices for a loaded Montana and a loaded Venture were very similar. The Pontiac included more goodies, however. It's worth noting that the Venture was more flexible in optioning than the Montana: this could be good for some people, but for us, we found that the Montana packages made a lot more sense than the ala carte Venture.

We did briefly stop by the Olds dealer. They seemed to be quite a bit higher pricewise than the Montana, and no more significant content (other than the bun warmers, which are a nice touch, but...) Also, the dealer there was simply not very knowledgable, so we went back to the Pontiac dealer to take a drive.

I liked the Montana styling better than the other two. As I mentioned earlier, the Venture struck me as kind of cheap looking, while the Silhouette looked like a straight Caravan knock-off. The Montana looked different from the others without going overboard. The ribbed lower panels are a bit much, but the fog lights and good-looking wheels give it a distinctive appearance in the minivan world. I think Pontiac did a great job giving it a Pontiac-like appearance without going overboard.

Driving it was similar to the Venture. We drove a sports-package equipped version, and it did feel a little more composed around corners than the Venture, but you won't mistake it for a Firebird. The gauge package is nice: I liked that the Montana had a tach and all-analog instrumentation. The steering wheel is thick and easy on the hands. Not a lot of surprises on the road: it generally tracks pretty well and handling is better than any of the other vans that I drove. Acceleration is, again, adequate, but there is no danger of any neck injuries.

We were really torn on the seating options. On one hand, I really liked the idea of the modular seats with the built-in child seats, but on-lot vans with this option were rare to nonexistant. Note that you cannot get the built-in child seats on the captains chairs, nor can you get leather on the modular seats. Also, the modulars made getting into and out of the back seat a real pain (with all of them in place). The modulars were also fairly uncomfortable compared to the captains chairs. Pontiac should really make the seating choices more clear: the whole process was very confusing, and required several salesmen to sort out the chairs vs. leather vs. built-in child seat thing. In the end, we went with the leather captain's chairs. They are very comfortable, provide a path front-to-back, and tilt forward to allow rear-seat access.

The power sliding door was a no-brainer. This is easily the best feature on this vehicle. When you have your hands full of groceries and a two-year-old, hitting the door-open button is a god-send. Pontiac was very careful about this feature: there's a disable button on the roof console, and open/cose buttons on the roof console, the &quot;B&quot; pillar in front of the door, and the key fob. You can also activate the power door by yanking on the handle. It's always worked great for me: I've had no problems with it. I just regret that I couldn't get it on the driver's side as well. It is a blessing to be able to sit our son in a seat at waist level without wrestling keys first.

So, we ended up with a light-green-over-tan extended length Montana, with all of the goodies and leather. We left off the Montanavision, because, frankly, if I speed $3K on a TV, it'll go in my family room, not my minivan. I'll get a $300 unit at Target if I need to watch movies in the van.

I do kind of like driving the van now. It has sort of a &quot;Starship Enterprise&quot; feel to it: there are buttons and knobs everywhere. We got the top-of-the-line AM/FM/Tape/CD radio with the dual source feature. Haven't actually used the rear-seat controls yet, but once our son gets old enough to listen to his own music, it'll be nice to be able to let him go on headphones while we listen to a different source. Also, the radio information is sort of amusing when travelling: some stations broadcast their call name and station info to the radio, so you can tell what type of station you are listening to from the radio display. I even found one station in Cleveland that sent down the title and artist of each song as they played it. A gadget, but nice. The only problem I have with the stereo is that the volume adjustment is too coarse at lower volumes: I need finer control. The trip computer (compass, thermometer, average and instantaneous mileage, mileage until empty, average speed, fuel used) comes in handy on trips. At night, everything glows in a warm orange light. Check this out before you buy: there's a LOT of orange stuff. 

I am quite impressed at the safety features. While not an airbag proponent myself, this van does have side airbags as well as the standard driver and passenger. I personally like the traction control and the ABS, which came in very handy during winter here in Ohio. We also got the self-sealing tires, which apparently did kind of work (my wife picked up a screw, which eventually let the air out of the tire, but the tech said she would have had a blow out without the sealing tires). I also like the idea of having the compressor in the back (in addition to doing load levelling (which in and of itself provide safety due to evening out the load on the tires and keeping the lights pointing in the right direction), you can use the compressor in the back to inflate balls, tires, flotation devices), so we can reinflate if we would have to fix a flat. I've already used the compressor to inflate a stroller tire, a large purple ball, and the tires on my car. The hose is huge, so it should reach about anywhere.

We have the 50-50 split folding rear seat. Our seat spends about 1/2 of the time in the fully forward folded position, maximizing rear room while keeping all of the seats installed. Folding and unfolding the seats are easy, but there really is very little space when they are unfolded: you get about enough room to line bags of groceries behind the seat, but that's it. I haven't had the second row of seats out of the van yet, but the rears do come out pretty easily. The rear seat is VERY roomy if unfolded: it's like riding in a limo.

As for driving, it is fairly good. It is affected by wind, but not as much as you'd think. I would say it is on par with a full-size sedan. Interior noise is fairly quite except for some wind noise. Two lane passing can get a little scary: mid-range (60-85) acceleration isn't anything to brag about. Braking is very good: good feel, no surprises and decent, ABS-assisted stops. The van feels a little tippy going around corners at sporting speeds, but it keeps a decent line and the tires stick fairly well. Dual 12V outlets provide power for a radar detector and a CB or a cell phone during travelling.

Any surprises? Not really. It's a minivan, plain and simple. It works as advertised without a lot of fuss. The styling and the interior layout really did it for me, and it is an excellent value for what you get (especially with the GM discount, and we used a GM card for _years_ before purchasing). My wife says she'll never go back to a car: she loves the up-top seating position, and the space that she has available.

There are some nits to pick. The top seal of our windshield keeps flying out and drumming on the roof of the van. Need to get that fixed! Also, there is no way to turn off the automatic lights that I have found. This is a big problem at, say, the drive-in or one of the drive-through Christmas light places. The best I found was to turn off the car, depress the emergency brake one click, and then restart. The lights will stay off until the emergency brake is completely released. Also, the buttons for the power driver's seat are very poorly positioned right against the door. There is absolutely no way to see them unless you are outside of the car. There are a few creaks and moans over the rough stuff: I fear for what it'll sound like in 100K miles. The clothes hangers in the back hand the clothes perpendicular to the side of the van, blocking the view out the back window. I'd also like to see an auto-dimming rear-view mirror in the van.

Overall, I'd recommend the Montana to families that are looking for a workhorse of a van with a some style and sportiness. It is feature rich, so the gadget-hungry will also love it. If you're looking for economy, this isn't the one for you: check the Venture or the Plymouth stuff. Also, although I do like the styling, it is still a minivan: if you want to make a statement, check out the PT Cruiser, one of the sport-utes that are available, or a large sedan.<br><br>
