            When I was looking for a car about a year ago, I was looking for a car that was comparable to my 1990 Pontiac Grand Am. Driving my Cutlass Calais is just like driving my old Grand Am. Although when I bought the car it had a bit of a problem with the engine missing. Before I bought the car someone who owned it previously had rebuilt the engine but did not drill the hole for the last spark plug right and the missing is contributed to the bad spark plug.
 The car in itself is all around a great car. I recently took it on a long trip to the Upper Pennisula of Michigan and the car handle the 9 hour drive on dirt roads, mountain like roads, as well the other types of roads the U.P. has to offer. The car was very comfortable, got great gas mileage, and was great on oil.
 I would not suggest this car for someone who is tall though because of the lack of seat settings this car has of course. But other than the tall people I would recommend this car for everybody even if you are one of those people who like to haul things in the car. It handles pretty well. I would have to say if the car can keep up with me it can handle anything.<br><br>
