            I won a football pool at work, $300.00, and decided to add another $100 or so and buy a digital camera.  After much research, I finally chose the Olympus D490-Z, and I couldn't be happier.  The pictures are gorgeous, even printed at 8x10 on regular copy paper with the camera set to its default setting.  
The download time on the pictures isn't nearly as slow as I feared, and Olympus has a coupon (find it on the internet) for a FREE USB card reader (the camera comes with only a serial connection).  
It also comes with non-rechargeable lithium batteries, but they are also lasting a lot longer than I thought (I purchased an inexpensive NiMh charger and 8 batteries in addition). I have gotten into the habit of using just the viewfinder rather than the lcd screen, and I'm sure that saves a lot on the battery life. 
With 3x optical zoom and 2.5x digital zoom and a host of manual adjustments, this camera is a great addition to my photo hobby.  I highly recommend it for anyone looking to buy a digital camera.<br><br>
