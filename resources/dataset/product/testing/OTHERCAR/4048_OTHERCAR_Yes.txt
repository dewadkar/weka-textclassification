            I did quite a bit of research in preparing to buy this vehicle.  I have been a satisfied customer of Mazda, Hyundai, and Toyota in the past, so I went into this pretty open minded.  The more I read, and the more I asked around, the more positive I heard about the Mazda Tribute.  I ruled out Toyota and Honda because I just didn't feel they had the value of the Mazda, seemed a bit smaller, and lacked a V-6.

When it came down to the final cut, I seriously considered the Hyundai Santa Fe.  I bought a new Elantra in 1997, (and still own it) and have been pleasantly surprised by the Hyundai's durability. Hyundai's 100,000 mile warranty did also give me something to think about.  

When it came down to the final kicking of the tires I went to a dealership that sold both the Santa Fe and the Tribute, and in the final test the Tribute just seemed a little bit better all around.

I have now owned this vehicle for 6 months, and have just broken 10,000 miles. It was used for a long haul family vacation, and numerous weekend trips. It has met all my expectations.  It is a pleasure to drive on the highway, the V6 engine is even a bit more peppy than past ones that I have owned.  

The only real issue that I wish could be improved is gas mileage.  This vehicle is replacing a Toyota Camry wagon.  I guess I am an old die hard, who wishes that stations wagons were still as common as they were.  The old Camry (1990) gets about 30 mpg on the highway, where this gets a very common SUV highway 22 mpg, and I get about 20 mpg on average.
