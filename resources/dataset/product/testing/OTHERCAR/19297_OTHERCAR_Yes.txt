            Fuji FinePix 1400
By Stephen Smith

I got the Fuji FinePix as a present and I love it.  It is a great digital camera.  It�s compact, light, and just a really great camera.  It has served me well and I think that it is just perfect for just about anybody.  It is 1.3 megapixels and feels like a professional camera.  It comes buddle with some great stuff, but I wish they�d have included a larger memory card. Also the battery life is really short, but all of this doesn�t bother me, I still think that it is a great camera.

This camera is about the size of a card deck, only a little bit longer and little bit fatter.  You can fit it into a jacket pocket; it�s a little too big for a jean or khaki pocket.  You can take it with you when you go on walks, on trips, on airplanes, in the car, or just about anywhere.  The compact size makes it a great candid camera for those special one in a lifetime moments when you think, �&amp;$@#!  Where�s that camera when I need it!� and it solves the problem of not having any film around when you need it since it uses a SmartMedia card, which is like a small 3� floppy disk but really small and with no moving parts.

The camera itself can take 1.3 megapixel photos, which is about what a consumer would need.  It won�t be able to be blown up to sizes much bigger than 8 by 10 inches, but that�s okay since I can use my film camera for that.  The quality is good enough for web pictures, and being blown up to sizes up to 8 by 10 inches.  The thing I really like about this camera is the flash.  It has great range and knows when to use it and when not to use it (although it isn�t too good about that so sometimes you�ll have to manually remove the flash feature which isn�t that hard).  I even tested it when in a dark closet without any light and it lit up the closet and you could clearly see every button on every shirt.

This camera comes bundled with some great stuff.  It comes with some software, a memory card, and even a USB snag cord.  The software includes some image editing software (Adobe PhotoDeluxe Home Edition 3.0), an image-reading program to view the manual (Adobe Acrobat Reader), and the USB driver.  It also includes a memory card (SmartMedia to be exact) but I wish it had more memory.  It only includes a 4-megabyte card, but the people who bought it also bought a 16-megabyte SmartMedia card and I think that is adequate.  I haven�t filled it up yet.  The bundle even includes a USB snag proof �noise reduction� extension cord, but I don�t see the use, I use it anyway though!  

This brings me to my next point, the fact that it connects to your computer using a USB port.  USB (Universal Bus Port) is the second fastest connection (besides FireWire but most computers don�t have one of those including me!) and is Plug-�n-Play which means you don�t have to turn the computer off to get the computer to recognize it.  This camera also functions a SmartMedia reader.  Since it reads SmartMedia and connects to the computer, Fuji engineers decided to make it function as a reader instead of making to buy a separate $100 hunk of plastic.  This also means that if you have any other device that reads SmartMedia cards, you can just jam (not literally, please!) it into this and it will read it.  This isn�t all that useful though since most devices use the similar (and in my mind, exact) Compact Flash cards.

Besides the small memory card, I have one more gripe about this digicam.  This thing sucks up battery life like there�s no tomorrow.  It died through one day of heavy use, which means if you use it normally, it will only last for a week or so.  This is a flaw that�s apparent in most digital cameras.  It is because of the LCD screen on the back of the camera that acts at the viewfinder, digital library, navigation device, and just about everything else.  When taking pictures I always use the tradition viewfinder so that the battery life is increased.  I am forced to use it though when navigating, deleting pictures, or viewing pictures on the digital camera.  It is a nice 1.4-inch (diagonally) screen that is useful when you need it.

Overall besides the two major flaws I think that this is a great camera that has a lot of apparent uses.  It would be great for the budget-minded consumer (I don�t know the exact price, but I think it�s pretty cheap) and anybody who wants a first digicam but doesn�t want any frills like movies, but wants a solid digital camera.  This wouldn�t be good for a professional because the resolution isn�t great enough for the quality a professional is looking for.  But I still think this is a great camera for the consumers and I give it a 4/5.<br><br>
