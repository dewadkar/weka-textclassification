            I did some research on digital camera's to find a moderately priced 2.1 megapixel that I would be able to use.  I have always respected Ricoh name.  But this camera was a TOTAL disappointment!  The first one I got popped the flash on the third flash picture I took.  The customer support was wonderful and technical support was also.  They had me send it back for a replacement.  I got the other one about 1 1/2 weeks later and could not ever get it to work without the a/c adapter plugged in.  So I was preparing to pack it back up and was in the process of removing battery from compartment when it suddenly came on with the battery hanging out about an eighth on an inch????????  Sent it back and asked for my money back.
