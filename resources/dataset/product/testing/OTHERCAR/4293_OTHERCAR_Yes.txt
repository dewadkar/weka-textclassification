            First I have to start off by saying that if you have not driven the car, how can you give a review of it!?!

I LOVE the Volkswagen Jetta. It is a well built car with a good drive and great features. 

When Volkswagen came out with the New Beetle I must say that I was a little hesitant to the idea. A agreed that it had a good look, especially for those who loved the original Beetle. But I just wasn't sure about the idea. Then I checked it out...

These little cars are pretty cool. They have pretty much everything the Jetta has to offer including heated seats and a fully automatic sunroof (which is designed quite nicely). There are accessory outlets all over this car. I was pretty impressed with the trunk space as well.

Then I got in the car. Now, I am 6'2&quot; tall and I always have to move the car seat ALL the way back. I got in the New Beetle and had to move the seat up slightly to comfortably push the clutch in all the way. That was impressive. Even more impressive is the amount of room in the back seat of this &quot;little&quot; car. I had to admit, this one was winning me over.

I started her up and took off. The ride was very impressive. The Beetle shifted smother than the Jetta. The ride was smooth and the handling was great. I left the car very impressed. If I hadn't gotten in I wouldn't have.

I still feel it is a little &quot;girlish&quot;. I could do without the bud vase. But I really like this car. I drove the turbo model and would recommend spending the extra few bucks to get it. 

I also have to take a moment and compliment Volkswagen on their key design. It is little things like the keys that make all the difference in the world.<br><br>
