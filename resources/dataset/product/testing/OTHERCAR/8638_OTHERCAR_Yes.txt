            <I>DaeWHO?</I>


Daewoo is a company that started in Korea in 1964 as Daewoo Industrial, becoming Daewoo Corporation in 1982 when it merged with Daewoo Development. In 2000 they became what they still are now, Daewoo International Corp. serving the needs of major industry worldwide whether through trade facilitation, heavy industry supply, final manufacture, as well as a wide array of consumer products including general electronics (TVs, DVD players), computer electronics (motherboards, drives), and most importantly (for this review) vehicles. Daewoo began manufacturing cars in 1984 supplying Asia, Eastern Europe, and ultimately the United States starting in the mid nineties.



<I>The Car</I>


The model I had for a week while my car was in the shop for hail damage was the Leganza CDX with Olive Silver Metallic paint and a beige leather trimmed interior. It featured the &#147premium&#148 stereo, power everything, A/C, tilt steering, rear defrost, child locks, fog lights, and all of the other options you would expect to see on a more expensive car. This particular car did not have a sunroof or heated seats which is not too surprising considering it was a rental, but it did have ABS. The car came with 15&#148 Hankook H406 tires and cast wheels.



<I>Interior</I>


The interior is far nicer than the price tag may suggest. The seats are really quite comfy and not as slippery as the notably thick leather might lead you to believe, in fact they held me in place well. Seat adjustment is quick and easy, making it simple to get comfortable quickly. Technically, the leather is only on facing surfaces, but the vinyl surfaces match very well and to the average buyer may be indistinguishable. The quality of the plastics used on the doors as well as the instrument panel and on and around the radio cluster was nothing short of high end. The dash in particular reminded me slightly of the Passat in the way it felt, supple and nicely textured. 

The front doors have good storage for maps and other small items you might not want or need to stow in the glovebox. The carpeting and padding is of average quality, but mind you not &#148cheap&#148. The floor mats were thick and fit the floor well. There is ample room in the front seats for even somebody my size, 6�&#148/250#. This required me to have the seat all the way back at which point rear seat room disappears and is really only suitable for a child. Allowing a friend of mine who is 5�&#148 to get comfortable behind the wheel, I found that when I hopped in behind her I actually was relatively comfortable. The bottom line is I couldn&#146t reasonably fit myself and 3 of my male friends in there, well, we <I>could</I>, but we&#146d be sardines.



<I>Ergonomics and Controls</I>


Everything in the instrument cluster is laid out well and is easy to see. The only analogue gauges are the speedo, tach, temp, and fuel guage, all other indicators are lights like the turn signals, check engine, etc. The steering wheel is set quite closely to the dash itself allowing a better view of the instruments almost regardless of how you have set the tilt on the wheel. Controls for the rear defrost, fog light, and hazards are located on the radio cluster, which is clearly laid out and easy to use at just a glance. 

This particular model had a CD player as well as a tape deck. The CD player demonstrates the ability of the speakers which were quite good and actually featured a component set up front. I found the tuner to of poor quality, barely pulling in some of the strongest stations in town. Everything is easy to reach operate, whether the button to the rear defrost, the e-brake handle, door pulls or handles, seat adjustments, or trunk pop/gas door releases.



<I>Exterior</I>


The paint seems of good quality and has a very deep look to it. It doesn&#146t have any metal flake, but still seems to glint. The rubber mouldings are attractively placed and seem very durable. Although from the inside the seating positions seem high, from the outside the car seems to sit rather low giving it a mildly sporty look. The choice of tip on the exhaust, though not oversized, adds to this look. The body form was actually done out of house by Italdesign and is unique to say the least. The sheet metal on the rear doors comes up quite high adding to sweeping form. The grille is definitely an attention getter but I am not entirely sure if that is a good thing, maybe it just hasn&#146t grown on me enough yet. All of these styling points come together to make an attractively aerodynamic look, one that tends to grow on you.



<I>Engine and Suspension</I>


This model features a 4 cylinder 2.2 litre &#147DTEC&#148 powerplant putting out 131hp at 5300 rpm and 148lb/ft peaking at 2800 rpm. Considering that this car is roughly 3200 lbs I was surprised that, especially when in &#147sport&#148 mode, how quickly it gets up and goes. Sport mode simply keeps the car in gear a little longer and downshifts earlier when you tap the gas. Mileage during my use was less than impressive, averaging about 17mpg, but being a rental, maintenance was probably not the best. The hood opens with ease and stays up by itself. Everything is easy to find, fill, check, or replace and I was surprised by the sheer size of the intake and airbox.

For the most part the engine is pretty quiet whether at highway speed or tooling through the neighborhood. When you do get on the gas hard it is more than vocal even with the windows up and the stereo on, but not in a straining kind of way. The shifting could be smoother, but I&#146ve driven much worse and having it in sport mode doesn&#146t help, especially since it spools up almost 6000 rpm. Passing power at highway speeds is poor but it cruises effortlessly. 

The ride is controlled and tight at higher speeds with predictable and responsive steering. The same is true for just riding around town or the neighborhood, not harsh, giving enough input and road feel without being fatiguing. This car also sits quite flat on higher speed turns like highway exits and flyovers. I have read that this cars suspension is unrefined. Maybe this might be true if one were holding it up next to a LS430, but for the car it is and the price, it&#146s more of a sporty feel that I find quite enjoyable.



<I>Safety</I>


This car is downright average when it comes to crash tests and unfortunately below average on a few. In reality, by mean scores, it&#146s actually just as safe as my 95 Accord, which isn&#146t saying a whole heck of a lot. The car feels solid and secure none the less, but if one were buying this car on safety alone, there are much better choices out there for about the same price, give or take a few hundred. As mentioned, safety features like child locks as well as airbags (front only) are present as they are in <I>all</I> cars, so again, this is not saying much. I guess my point here is that as far as safety, this car is particularly unremarkable.



<I>Final Thoughts</I>


I was really very pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this car. It is comfortable, zippy if not truly fast, handles well, has good comfort and amenity controls and options, looks unique, has excellent visibility, and an overall solid feel. All of these things and more combined with the price and well thought out dealer service and support make for a real bargain. The downside here is that 2003 may be the last year for Daewoo&#146s vehicles here in the states. Daewoo has already decided to cut sales to other parts of the world already as cost cutting measures to make up for falling sales here in the states.

Personally, I would hope that GM, Hyundai, and other controlling interest decide to keep them here. Daewoo has a good little product for the money, even though reliability may still be a little suspect on some models and resale is rather poor, but the latter being a function of the fact that they are still so new here. With all that being said I still think it is a worthwhile look in your car-shopping quest and right now in particular, there are tremendous incentives to be had, again, due to Daewoo&#146s increased efforts to move their products, which still don&#146t include heavy or directed advertising. BTW, the 2003 Leganza, though being only moderately updated, does look a lot better than the 2002. I hope this has been helpful and happy driving.
