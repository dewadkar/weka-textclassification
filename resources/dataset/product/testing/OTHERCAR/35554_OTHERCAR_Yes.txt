            Recently while visiting family for Easter my husband and I spotted a interesting looking little camera called a PenCam in Wal-mart. We bought the camera with little discussion because it was certainly in our price range. In the car, my husband immediatly set to work on installing the batteries and reading instructions, and by the time we reached the family gathering the memory was full. Being too impatient to wait until our return home we began installing software into my mothers computer and taking dozens of pictures. Everyone was plesantly suprised with this little camera. It was easy to take pictures, easy to download them (even for me), it worked great as a webcam, and was overall a fun device to use. By the end of our visit all three family members who owned a computer were making plans to buy their own PenCam. After arriving home in the evening we did run into some problems. We discovered that no matter how many lights we turned on in our home, it was not enough light to take pictures. Unfortunatly this camera will have to be a daytime use only camera. Another thing that was slightly annoying is that when you hold the camera in your hand, it seems that your finger migrates over the lens. As a result, I am constantly making sure to steer clear of the lens even though this is where my hand feels most comfortable. Over all I do give this camera a good review, it is inexpensive, easy to use, and great for a beginner such as myself.
