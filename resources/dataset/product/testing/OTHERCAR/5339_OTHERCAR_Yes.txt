            I bought this used in a auction in Iowa.  The other guy did not show up due to a snow storm so the van was mine for the asking.

I was pleasantly surprised at the way it handled in the snow considering it was the first time I had driven it.  It has anti-locks brakes that makes stopping in slippery weather very easy.  The front wheel drive is good for traction in the snow.

The other surprise I got was how well it turned.  The van turns on a dime-better than some cars.  For being a van, and longer than most vehicles, the turning radius is very short.  It can take tight corners with ease.  It can make a u-turn in most city streets.

The two back seat benches are removable.  They are easy to get in and out of the car and are not too heavy to lift.  Once the seats are gone, the cargo space is enormous.  I have used the van to move twice and I have not needed a rental truck.  I can fit queen size beds, dressers, couches--you name it-it will fit.

When the seats are in, I can easily load groceries in the side door with no problem.  I can fit 7 adults, including me, in the van comfortably with plenty of room behind the back seat to fit the luggage.

The van also gets good gas mileage-22 miles per gallon city and 27 miles per gallon highway.

This vehicle was the best decision I made in a long time.
