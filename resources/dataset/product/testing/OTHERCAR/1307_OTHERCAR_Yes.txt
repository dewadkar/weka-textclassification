            It seems that like everyone else on the road I had to have a sport utility vehicle - its the in thing. we did plenty of shopping around and finally settled on what our budget could afford - the base model 4 runner. True to what I had heard it is a reliable vehicle or has been for the three years we owned it. we never had to take it into the repair shop. overall i am happy with this vehicle and would recommend it highly. If I can complain at all I would have to say that for the price we paid there were no bells &amp; whistles but we were trying to keep cost down. I was also unhappy with the lease but i'm sure that is another whole topic in itself. we got a good 73,000 miles out of this SUV. The rear area offers plenty cargo room. The only regret is the model we bought had 4 cylinder with less than ideal pick-up and this model did not have anti-lock brakes which made for less than ideal handling with sharp braking.TanyaP<br><br>
