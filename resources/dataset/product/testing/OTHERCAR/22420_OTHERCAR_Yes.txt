            The 1993 Toyota Pickup is a vehicle destined to become a classic!  The model I tested was a regular cab 4x2 with a 4 cyl engine, 5 speed, and 3 inch lift kit with the oversized (not offroad) wheel and tire package. 

The truck drives...well like a truck.  The acceleration is poor, the cornering stinks, and the truck constantly wallows and bobs over the smallest road imperfections.  However, this is no luxury car and I imagine the buyers of this thing won't be turned off by this.  

The raised body gives a commanding view of the road as the occupants are seated in a purely functional interior.  There are no asthetic ornamenations of any sort inside.  You have to manually roll the windows and opperate the locks.  The seat is a vinly bench that is ajusted by the driver.  All controls and switches are cheap looking, but work very well.  The only real problemn I have in this area is how Toyota failed to include a tach.  On a truck with an auto, it would have made sense, but with a 5 speed, you'd really like to know when you are hitting that peak power band on the engine which, in this case, is a guessing game.

The exterior of the truck is awesome!   It's built to be rugged and tough.  In other words, it does not look like a jelly bean.  The shape isn't aerodynamic but looks very handsome.  Using things like sealed beam headlamps (cheap to replace) and generic looking outside rear view mirrors was a great idea!  

The engine and transmission are gems!  These trucks are known to go at least 300,000 miles without any trouble at all.  Overall, I'd recommend the toyota pickup.  It is a great vehicle that will last!  Resale value is also very high!<br><br>
