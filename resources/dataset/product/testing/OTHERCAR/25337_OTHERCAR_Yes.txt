            Here's what I like:  leather interior doesn't feel cheap, it handles like a European car and accelerates very well.  Those are the high points.  I'll be honest...I've had the car for 3.5 years now and that's a record for me.  I usually keep cars for 1-2 years and get tired of them and trade-in.  But, don't let that fool you into thinking that this is an especially awesome car...far from it.  It's rather bland, actually.  I got lucky and found the model that included power leather seats, a 6CD changer, spoiler, alloy rims and performance tires/suspension as standard options (read, NO additional cost).

For some reason, those simple options have kept me in this car despite the following things:  an extremely rattly, squeaky dashboard (Ford recalled it recently), a fuel pump that broke and a very cramped back seat.  I don't beat on my cars, in fact I care for them very well and rarely drive on rough roads.  That's why I was surprised when the dash started rattling and the fuel pump went bad.  Neither instance was any more trouble than an overnight stay at the dealer, but nuisances nonetheless.

Overall, my feeling is this:  the Mystique is a nice small-mid sized car with many options that don't cost an arm and a leg.  If you get the V-6 version, you'll be extremely happy with the performance and handling and the noise won't be quite as bad as the 4-cylinder version.  However, the quality leaves something to be desired.  Never have I heard so many rattles in a car that hasn't been on rough roads.  I would definitely buy it again and recommend it to others based on the included options, but would haggle more on the price/payments knowing the rattles to come.
