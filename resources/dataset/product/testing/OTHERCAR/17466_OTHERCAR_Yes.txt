            We were looking to replace an aging 1988 Nissan Van.  I was burned by an American make years ago, but that's another story.

We considered the Honda, Nissan, Toyota and Mazda vans.  The Nissan is made in a Ford factory, so that ruled them out.  The Mazda is just too small looking.  The Honda dealer wanted above sticker price plus having to wait a few months.  Toyota makes a wonderful vehicle, but the distributor (Gulf States) puts a lot of pricey stuff on their vehicles that you really don't need ($3,000 towing package).  Toyota dealers won't budge on the distributor add ons.

I work with a few Kia owners.  They are overall satisfied with their vehicles.  We stopped in a Kia dealer.  We saw and drove the van and loved it.  I'll get to the features later.  Dealer #1 wanted $1,295 for detailing a new vehicle, while dealer #2 wanted $495 for detailing.  We detailed right out of those places.  They also were not too specific on shipments of more vans.

Dealer #3 got our business.  No detailing fee, no salesperson with a smug attitude.  The Sedona EX we bought has ABS and leather for just over $23,000.  Quiet ride from a heavy (4800+ lb) vehicle. Super stereo, lots of cup holders, comfortable seats.  Seats are easy to remove or to reconfigure.  Two gloveboxes, another box on the dash and a lockable compartment under the front passenger seat.
Yes, it has quite enough power to get on a freeway safely.
Back seats have airliner style individual lights and personal air vents.  Easy in and out.

Kia must have bought one of each van being sold in the US and reverse engineered their own!  

I urge you to consider this Korean vehicle.  They're new to the US market but have been sold elsewhere since 1999.  They should have most if not all of the manufacturing issues worked out.
