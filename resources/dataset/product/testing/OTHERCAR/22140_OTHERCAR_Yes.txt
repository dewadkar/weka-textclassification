            The Kodak DC215 zoom digital camera is a great first purchase for those looking to explore the world of digital photography.  The camera is small, easy to handle and has all of the features you could need to take great pics indoors and out.  At slightly over 1 mega pixels, the picture quality in a 5 x 4 format is equal to that of standard film.  The money you save on film and processing charges easily make-up for the slightly higher price tag (approx. $100-$150 more) you would pay for a quality 35 mm camera.  The only negative comment I could come-up with for this product is that the lens is located at the far left hand side of the body.  Since the viewfinder is not through-the-lens, it is easy to forget the location of your fingers and get them in the way of the lens.<br><br>
