            My wife and I recently had to do some car shopping. Our 1996 Sentra GLE had a little altercation with a tree in a hotel parking lot during a storm and came out on the losing end. As we watched our poor little car being towed away we knew we'd be looking Nissan as a first choice for the new car.

At the dealership we found a model another customer had supposedly ordered but backed out of. We fell in love with it. It was a 2001 Sentra SE with all the options but a sunroof. We were hoping for the sunroof/moonroof but this car had one thing that made up for it...leather interior! It may not be a standard option, but it can be done for a few extra bucks.

Before I continue keep in mind this review concerns the SE, I'll admit to not being impressed with the Sentra XE or GXE and if we didn't end up with the SE we'd have probably gone elsewhere.

We've had the car a week and I simply love it and it certainly seems like a car worth far more than the price we paid both in styling and performance. 

This car features a 2.0 145hp engine that offers <b>much</b> more power than our 1996 Sentra had. I was never much of an "under the hood" freak, but once you have a little extra power there you learn to love it. Our car also features a "sport-tuned" suspension system. I actually like the stiffness of it. It seems (to me at least) that I traded a little smoothness for a little more control. I like that trade. As far as actually driving the car I'm more than pleased.

The styling was another thing we really liked. The rear spoiler adds a fun "sporty coolness" to the car and barely hinders your rear view. Plus, I like the added brake light in the spoiler. The car is a bit longer than I expected and it certainly feels it behind the wheel when compared to our old Sentra. Again, this is not a bad thing, I prefer it. The front looks just as good as the back with the addition of foglights. The overall outer design & styling looks a little older than it actually is, but not so dated as to be old looking. (did that last line make sense?) The car we chose was a color called Radium. We were hoping for silver and this is pretty close. Kind of a conservative silver color. In fact both my wife and I swear there's a hint of gold or champagne color in it in certain light. There were probably shades of silver available on other car that are truer to silver but in the end we've come to decide that we like this color very much. The standard interior on the other Sentras we saw at the dealer that day featured a multi-colored broken glass look. To sum it up, it was hideous. This is one reason we were so happy to find the leather. It's simple, it's grey and it looks great.

The interior is perfect for our family. The backseat is small. Actually it's very small. However with a four year old and a newborn, backseat space isn't a priority. There are even rear cupholders which are another added benefit with little ones in the backseat. The controls are positioned in a logical and easy to use manner. I <i>really</i> like the intermittent wipers, it was one of my gripes about our 1996 Nissan. The radio is up high and easy to get to while the 6 disc changer resides at the bottom of the center dash. Simple dials control heat/air and defroster. As I mentioned earlier we actually got leather in this car. Love the feel and look, if you can make it happen in your Sentra I highly recommend it! I also love the titanium-colored gauges. Easy to read in light, dark and any condition in between. Trunk space seems much larger to us than it did on the old car too. Tinted windows add the final touches to a great looking and feeling car.

Overall we're very happy to have run into this find at the local dealer as we have a car we love that has a bit of a "custom" feel to it and it certainly feels like a car we spent much more on than we did. 

If you're in the market now, you may want to wait for the 2002 SE-R, it looks to be an upgraded 2001 SE. If you seek value over performance then go now - you won't be disappointed with the 2001 SE.
