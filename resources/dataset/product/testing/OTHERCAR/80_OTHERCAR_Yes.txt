            After years of large, gas guzzling cars and trucks, I decided that I needed a different type of vehicle. A former motorcycle lover, I decided that I wanted a small, Japanese convertible that would give me good gas mileage and still be fun to drive. 

I work with two people that have Miata's and they raved about theirs being fun to drive and reliable. So, I started looking and found a used 97. It is black with tan top and tan leather interior. After driving it one time, I fell in love with it and bought it. 

The ride is rough, but then again, this isn't a Lincoln, so if your looking for ride, go somewhere else. BUT, where the car shines in pure driving pleasure, especially with the top down. It is pretty quick for a four cylinder car, gets terrific gas mileage and eats corners like no tomorrow. 

There isn't much trunk room and not too much storage in the passenger compartment, but there is enough for a weekend getaway. I understand there are after market luggage racks that should help this situation. I am 5'10&quot; tall and have no problem getting in and out of the car and after your in it, the leg room is ample. 

All controls are laid out well and are easy to read. Shifting with the 5-speed is flawless and the exhaust note is pleasing to the ear. All in all a fun and economical car to drive, one that I would highly recommend. The trade offs for the fun drive are the small trunk, overly large headlights that almost block your view at night and the rather stiff ride. But then again, like I said before, this isn't a Lincoln. Just try to have this much fun in a Lincoln though!<br><br>
