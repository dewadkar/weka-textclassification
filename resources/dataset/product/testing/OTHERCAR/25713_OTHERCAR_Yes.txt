            I love my Pathfinder!

It is reliable.  It is durable.  But it could be better.  Oh well, no since in fretting, after all, it is 5 years old.  My truck has 96,000 miles on it, and I have had minimal problems, so I'm not complaining.  But just incase you are in the market to by a 5 year old Pathfinder, then here are my two cents.

First of all, why Nissan decided to keep the same body style for almost 7 years is beyond me.  I mean, when I first saw the "truck of my dreams" it was in 1993.  I saw this commercial of the guy going to a wedding in a tuxedo, in his new black and rugged Pathfinder bouncing in the dirt.  I loved it.  I imagined myself in it.  I fell in love with this truck.  Then in 1998 I graduated from College and could finally afford an automobile.  My first choice was a terrible one, and I'll have an epinion about that one too.  But finally, my Pathfinder and I found each other and it was love at first site.

The body shape of the Pathfinder changed in 1996 (just my luck).  They were rounder, and bigger. I was a little jealous that people who bought a truck a year after mine was nicer looking.  But a lot of people preferred the boxier shape of my Path than the new ones.  With the box shape comes less wind resistance however.  The old Paths have poor wind resistance and you feel it doing 70mph in moderate winds.  Your truck will want to take you where the wind tells it to go (this is also accompanied with cabin noise). With the smoother curves of current models, you won't feel or hear a thing.

Some of these things are clearly superficial of course, but the 1999.5 and 2000 Pathfinders are made better in every way than the older models.  The new models are heavier which makes a better ride, more horsepower, more room, better suspension, and did I mention MORE HORSEPOWER!!! (I'm a horsepower fanatic, please excuse me).

My point, after all the blabbing, is that if Nissan can make a truck that withstands the test of time and Mileage in 1987,88,89,90,91,92,93,94 and 95, (I've seen 1987 paths still on the road today) and they continually get better at making them every year (opinions from other Pathfinder enthusiasts) then they most certainly have done a good job for the 2000 edition.

My Pathfinder has now 107,000 miles on it, and still, it is behaving quite well.  The only thing that I've noticed is horsepower.  Horsepower on my Pathfinder doesn't seem to be as strong feeling as I remember.  A 1995 Nissan Pathfinder has 151 Horse's under the hood, but it feels like way less.  This could be age talking.  Maybe over the years it loses that punch.  Or maybe since I know the feeling of having 171+ horsepower, I feel left out.

I'm looking to put a few extra's on my Pathfinder in the next four years. I'm thinking: darker tint for front passengers and back, more fog lights, 17" rims, performance tires (instead of Off road tires), front and back brush grilles, and perhaps a different color.  A Pathfinder that's almost 10 years old, might not go well on the market, so I figure this Path is here to stay.

(Below is just an update with what I've been thinking of doing to improve my trucks overall appeal. It has nothing to do with the trucks performance or reliability).

Well, the Pathfinders got 120,000 on it.  I do a lot of driving. I've been doing some window shopping over the year to upgrade my Pathfinder.  The reason being I've had it for a while, and I'm starting to get envious of new technology. These are the things I would like to do:
1. Upgrade seats
2. Upgrade headlights
3. Upgrade radio
4. Upgrade horsepower
5. Upgrade tires
6. Upgrade wheels
7. Upgrade suspension
8. repaint

Quick comments: to upgrade the seats will cost major money, money of which I do not have.  Guess I'm going to have to do with seat inserts.  I think Walmart may have something for me.  They are a relatively cheap way to solve the problem.  I would like to get quality seats though.  Haven't found a way to do so, and not pay substatially for them.

They make zeon headlamps for this model now.  Careful though, make sure they are the best kind.  Don't go cheap!  If you go cheap, you'll only be replacing them again and again, because they don't last as long.

My factory installed radio is gone, meaning it doesn't work as nicely any longer (this includes tape deck, and optional CD Player).  I guess after 6+ years of continues use, they expect you to want to upgrade.

Horsepower...yeah right.  This model Pathfinder really lacks in horsepower.  It's quite underpowered.  I find it shifting into higher gears everytime it comes against a hill.  I could upgrade the horses, but this will be major money, and will have to be done by an expert.  Don't let anyone mess around with your vintage Nissan.  They can screw it up badly.  Since this will cost a couple of thousand dollars, I'll back away from this upgrade.

I currently have bridgestone Dueler APT tires on my truck.  They suck!  I'll be doing an epinion about them soon.  The original equipment for the truck is General Grabber.  I'm getting Perelli Scorpions (AT) on my truck quite soon.  They have nice snow, rain, and dry traction.

New wheels for my truck will cost a pretty penny.  Anything for older models usually will cost you an arm and a leg, wheels, being one of them.  Oh they have wheels that won't cost you so much, but they look terrible.  Good luck if you want to find some.  The Original wheels are hard to clean though.  They have these tiny ridges that make cleaning a nightmare.  And the plastic decal covering can get worn over the years.  I've tried repainting them myself but find that I'm doing it every year.  If you are cleaning your wheels, get eagle all wheel type cleaner.  Anything else can strip the paint off the plastic decal cover.

Suspension on my truck is ok now.  I went and got Nissan's OEM reinstalled in my truck last year.  BAD MISTAKE.  Don't go Nissan for anything unless you can go aftermarket, especially with this model truck.  They have better shocks, that are relatively inexpensive by KONI and KYB that are the best in the market (Koni being the best out of the two).

I am definitely painting it, this will most likely happen after I get my new stereo.  Painting will give your truck new appeal, something it may need after being 7 years old.  I am painting the front and back bumper, side wheel covers, side tubes, rear side mirrors, and tirerack.  Come on, my truck is 7 years old...it needs a facelift. :-)
