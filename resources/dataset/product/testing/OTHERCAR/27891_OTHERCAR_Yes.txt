            I am a college student here in Utah.  I go to school in one town and work in another.  The Suzuki Esteem has been a wonderful car for me.  It runs great and it gets good gas mileage.  I would recommend this car to anyone who does a lot of driving between two locations.  My particular car is a 1996.  The only thing I don't like about it is that it doesn't have power locks and windows.  I guess that's what you get when you buy a used car! LOL.  I have been driving it for quite sometime now and I haven't had any problems yet.  It has been very reliable.  I think that it rides really smoothly and it's a comfortable car.  I am so satisfied with it.  I have had other cars before and I guess this one can be compared to a Mazda Protege or a Honda Civic.  I love my car so I would recommend that you test drive one today.  Good Luck car shopping!<br><br>
