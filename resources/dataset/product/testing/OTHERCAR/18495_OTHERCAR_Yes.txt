            I recently decided it was time to treat myself to a new car.  I had made a significant life change (moving from NYC to the suburbs), had always been a car buff, and moving gave me the opportunity to finally get a brand new car for the first time in my life (I'm in my 40's!).  So I didn't want to blow my chance getting the wrong car but didn't want to blow my budget out either.  And having driven a BMW for years, I had a challenge ahead of me - which new BMW to get!  But, to be fair, I needed to do my homework, research and test drive them all, just so family and friends couldn't say I was bias which naturally I was.  So, who makes my short list?  Well, let's see - I'm a car snob so the Japanese cars won't do - except for the new Infinite G35, way cool.  OK, so the list shakes out to: 
Audi - The German on everyone's list.
BMW of course...
Infiniti, the new and cool factor
Jag, for snob appeal
Volvo, the work horse car of my youth
And well, just because, VW.  (Side bar - when I graduated from high school a million years ago, in preparation for college I got a year old VW Rabbit which turned out to be a cash cow lemon of a car and got my father back for all the nasty things he said over the years about the Bettle being a death trap and forbidding me to own one...so I had somewhat a 'taste' for the old VWs)... 

So the test driving goes well enough - The Audi (both the A4 and A6) are total winners but (The A4, not the A6 which was WAY too expensive for me) is a bit pricey still for what I need... 

(Needs: power everything, awesome AC, big fat comfy seats with butt warmers, 4 or all wheel drive, sunroof, great lighting - we live on a mountain prone to icy roads in the winter and it is one dark road at night with lots of deers etc, a nice sound system, and seats with memory so I don't have to reprogram my settings every time someone else drives the car!)

The BMW 3 series is naturally awesome but a little bit tight inside, styling inside hasn't changed at all in twenty years (if it ain't broke, don't fix it?) but best of all, have YOU been to a BMW dealership lately? - talk about doing you a favor...take my money, please! Arrogant would be an understatement - one salesguy said to me.."oh, you drive an 'OLD' BMW like it was a disease or something...thanks, but no deals to be find in BMW land.  Beware...I was TOTALLY turned off by the attitude thing.

The Infiniti is VERY nice, but its rear wheel drive, and it just seems to be trying too hard, plus they are in short supply and in high demand...and I just couldn't put my finger on what wasn't doing it for me so I passed.  

The Jag is a Ford underneath and behaved a bit more Ford-ish than Brit-ish...a little disappointing to say the least, but it was perhaps the most beautiful car inside out of the bunch.  

The Volvo totally did it for me too except - the S60 parking brake handle dug into my leg and the S80 just didn't have enough power for the way people drive in northern New Jersey!  I was disappointed because they are lovely cars indeed.

So, after deciding I was having a bit of a time with this new car thing, I drove into the VW dealership thinking, oh yea, this is doing to do it for me, right...and ended up with the 2002 Passat GLX 4Motion.  I am VERY pleased.  Here's why.

I wanted a stylish car and the nice folks at Volkswagen saw to making the Passat very handsome indeed. I think Volkswagen has some of the nicest color choices available in the "near luxury" car class.

I needed a car that was reliable and powerful enough to get me out of bad traffic situations and the Passat V6 just rocks.  If you stomp on the gas pedal it becomes a rocket.
The warranty has been increased to 4 years, and road side assistance is 24x7 and is standard with the GLX through AAA.  Clever and saves me $80 a year on an AAA membership, sorry AAA.

I wanted comfort - in all weather conditions the Passat GLX comes with climate control AC/Heat + variable heated front seats.  The seats were some of the most comfortable out of all that I tested - and I am a big guy!

I demanded a safe car and the Passat did very well in the crash tests AND has air bags all over plus side curtain air bars to boot.

I wanted a quality product, and the fit, finish and tightness of the Passat made me feel I was driving a solid, quality car.  PS - they seem to have gotten over that bad, lemon, Rabbit era nicely thank you!

I didn't want to break the bank, and frankly the nice folks at my local Volkswagen dealership were ready to wheel and deal - especially with the 2003's already coming and after I started spouting off all that I had learned from doing my research on the internet about leasing and buying!  Hello BMW NA - the ultimate driving machine is the ultimate loser in the deals department.  Take a hint will ya!

I wanted a car that was fun to drive but was also classy...refined without being too fussy.  The Passat achieves this balance for me nicely.  The Passat takes that German-car-thing serious in that it's simple (some people call it plain / vanilla - but hello, if you have been hanging in German cars you probably already know they subscribe to a "less is more" school of design), elegant - beautifully stitched leather but also fun - dig the colors of the displays - purple with red!  It's a wow.

And last, I wanted a car I liked a lot but wasn't going to sit up nights worried about.  You know, the whole time you're in the mall, concerned whether it's being sized up to be stolen or if the guy in the car next to me is a dope and dings my doors!  

A couple of words about the 4 cylinder turbo.  While it did a fine job, it did have what I call Turbo lag - that slight time between when you stomp on the gas pedal and when the turbo kicks in.  And while the gas mileage is probably better in the 4, I was much more impressed with the power and lift off with the V6.  PS - for the rocket G-force crowd, VW has just introduced the Passat with a V8!  However, the one disappointment for me (so far) is that the car requires high octane gas (91 octane or better) and my mileage is averaging about 19-20 MPG.  I guess I was hoping for better performance, but given everything else, this is the price you pay... 

So the Passat did it for me.  It scored in the head, heart, and pocketbook departments for me.  I have 500 miles on the car and am delighted.  Only time will tell how well it will hold up.  But with things starting out this well, I hope to be happy for a long time.
