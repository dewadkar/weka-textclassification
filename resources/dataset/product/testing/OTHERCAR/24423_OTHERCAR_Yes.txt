            After months of research, this camera consistently came out on top. It features 2.1 megapixel resolution pictures, movie mode (320x240) and a free angle LCD. The camera stores pictures on Sony's Memory Stick technology, available up to 64mb. Uses a Sony M Series Lithium Ion battery, which can tell you to the minute how long the camera is going to stay on for the selected mode. Has a bright flash, with red eye reduction, auto and manual focus, including macro mode, and volume/brightness controls for the sound and LCD.

The LCD itself can flip up and around, allowing people to easily take pictures of themselves using the timer mode. The LCD also then folds down to make the camera compact, and when turned back around, folds down to protect the LCD from damage while in pocket or backpack. It has two backlight settings, normal and bright. Easy to see in low light conditions. Also contains adjustment for brightness which doesn't change picture. The LCD is the sharpest i have seen.

The camera has a short startup time of maybe 2-3 seconds, afterwhich photos can be taken. It is a snap to change resolutions with the intuitive onscreen menu system. There are menus for everything, including a demo mode which i have to try out. Navigation of the menus is done through a circular button like the Sega Genisis controllers. Left/right/up/down, and middle to select. This also doubles for a way to traverse the image when in still mode, and zoomed in. (Thats right, zoom in on still pictures in playback mode, an then move around) The memory sticks are hot-swappable while the camera is on, and it takes no time for it to be ready to shoot again. By the time the cover is closed the camera is ready. I can fit 40 full resolution (3:2) pictures on a 32mb memory stick.

The S50 also contains many controls only found on SLR cameras, which is manual exposure control. F-Stop and Shutter Speed can be manually set, and the white balance has a few settings. I have gotten up to 8 second exposures out of the camera.

The pictures the camera takes are really sharp, just what i would expect from Sony. The movie mode is adequate. The 15 second movies at high res are just enough to capture small quicky events, and the 60 second low res movies are good for capturing friends goofing off. The high res movies will play full screen, however they will be noticably grainy. Both have decent sound. To get the pictures from the camera to computer uses a USB cable. The driver doesn't even require a reboot, and the camera shows up as a removeable disk drive. This lets you be able to swap out the memory sticks w/o restarting the camera or reconnecting. It takes about 2-3 minutes for the 32 megs to come over the line.

I chose Sony over other brands because this was one of the only cameras which came with everything you needed to get your pictures. No buying memory for it, comes with USB built in (not icky serial), lens cover, battery charger, it doesn't use AA. It also came with the strong reputation of all the other sony peripherals i have used, including their MVC-F70 (low-end mavica)

With the camera i bought a 32mb memory stick, a UV filter which both protects the lens and gets sharper pictures, and a 4 year warranty from Best Buy, which is a good deal for 60$. Including international 2 day swap. Buying the camera + 16/32/64 memory stick also got me a 50$ mail in rebate from Sony, and registering online gets you 20$ to spend in their online store, plus a year of a photo posting/swapping service which i havn't tried out yet.

I would not buy the DSC-S70 unless the 3.3megapix. were needed, because the LCD doesn't swivel.
