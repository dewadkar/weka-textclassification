            Now why did I buy the S4? I've drive an E55, a 911 and a '88 M3 before, all these cars shout performance, but yet none of them were as pleasing as the S4 is for me now. The 2.7l bi-turbo charged engine is a marvel, the low end torque peaking near 1800rpm and remaining at peak level until close to 3000rpm is amazing. The engine is fast, not in your face fast, but controllable fast. The 6spd manual is a joy to drive, even in city driving it is of only minor annoyance. The beautiful, beautiful Xenon headlights are very effective. The Alcatara sports seats are comforting and supportive, alcatara is a breeze to clean, if there is anything to critique it is that the engine was detuned from the European model to the North American. Yes the extra 15hp would not have made much of a difference, but I do feel a little cheated. Many people complain about the backseats being small, so far nobody that has ridden with me complained about them. This car can do 0-60 in 5.5 seconds stock, a vmax of 143mph and give you 6spd control, its a 911 as sedan.

The most notable feature in the car is the quattro system, its racing heritage is notorious. It has been banned from racing circuits due to its quality and inherent advantage. rain feels like a sunny day when responsibly driving with quattro.

The styling is aggressive yet stealthy, I would bet that 99/100 times when a police officer would have to choose comparably fast cars to pull over, the choice would never be the S4. 

It's a very tight great package capable of great tune ups and enhancement
