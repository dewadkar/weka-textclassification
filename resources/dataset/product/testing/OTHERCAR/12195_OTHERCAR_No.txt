            Nothing ever changes on the Firebird/Camero series. These cars are affordable but certainly aren't a good value compared to almost any other car on the road today. A Honda Civic costs half as much, takes half as much fuel, and the insurance is less than half that of a Firebird.  

But there's no sense harping on how practical it is or how little value you get because obviously that's not why retired baby boomers buy them in their old age.  (Amazing how the demographic for this vehicle is teenagers and senior citizens and NOTHING inbetween!)  People buy this car because it goes fast. And it has the look that says: "Get out of my way". 

Here's the problem:  Reality quickly sets in when you realize that all that horsepower will never get used unless you enjoy having your drivers licence suspended. And if you live in Canada, your Firebird won't go any faster than a Honda Civic anyway because the government will slap a "governer" on it that limits the maximum speed of the vehicle. (I believe it's 180-200km/h.)  

What really matters is the price you pay to own this car.  Gas prices have never been higher and this car is the worse car made today in terms of fuel economy.  Period.  Then there's insurance:  Insurance companies know why people buy these cars--to race them, so they will charge you THREE TIMES more than any other car on the road and won't even insure you at all if you're a teenage male.

The final nail in the coffin is the questionable quality of this car over the years. It's had a long history of laughable faults, design flaws, quirks, and downright scary oversights to make anyone shudder. My mom bought the first Firebird to ever have an Overhead Cam engine or whatever the heck that was 30 years ago and it was a total lemon. 

All I'm saying is, if you want a fast car you can probably modify a Honda Civic and put a turbocharger in it and some nitros or whatever and make yourself a pocket rocket. It will cost half as much, go just as fast, and you can have a gay old time.  If you have lots of money to waste, why not buy something upscale that gives you quality, luxury, AND performance?
