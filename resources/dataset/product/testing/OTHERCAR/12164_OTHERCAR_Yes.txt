            My opinion is that I never considered to purchased a pre-owned vehicle,  But my wife talked me into this Lexus SC400.  Now three years later it has only depreciated 48% and still is holding it value.  The sound system is excellent since I only listen to blues and jazz not like my fellow drivers who is jamming with rap.  The vehicle response is incredible!  When I want acceleration, I give it the gas  and I am beyond the safe driving mode. The luxury and comfort of the interior cabin is excellent on long road trips and short day beach trips.  But most of all the look of command on the road.  Not many other vehicles will intimidate the threat of pure power away from this Lexus 400.  I find the seats are a bit snug but after entering the drivers seat I am ready to ride!  My gas mileage is about average 18 -24 and I have had a small problem with the a/c but was cured by the dealership pronto.  I think anyone who feels young and want to let their hair (if you have any hair) will fly. This is the automobile to consider.  Not for everyone but anyone who wants to be young at heart.  I will gladly recommend the Lexus SC-400 or any Lexus vehicle to anyone.  I am waiting to see the new Lexus coupe convertible!  It could have Florida written all it for me!  Now my wife wants the RX-300!!  I AM IN TROUBLE.<br><br>
