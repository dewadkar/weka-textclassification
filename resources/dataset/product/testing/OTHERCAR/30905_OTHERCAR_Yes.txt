            I very much would love to have a minivan right now!  Unfortunately, it's just not in our budget. :(

However, my parents just recently traded their older Mercury Villager for a 2000 Mercury Villager Sport.  And I have some definite praise for these vehicles!!!

First let me mention that the Villager and the Nissan Quest are the exact same minivan... Mercury (or it's parent company) bought the plans from Nissan and, I believe, they are even made in the same plant.

Anyway, this minivan drives like a passenger car... I've driven it tons of times!  Some minivans I've driven feel like you're in a Mac truck! LOL!

The new Villager has rear slide-open doors on both the driver and passenger sides which makes it great getting the little ones in and out.  I experienced this for the first time last night! 

The middle bucket seats slide forward easily for those in the third bench seat to get in and out.  I think these are also removable.  The third bench seat is also removable for more cargo space.  With the seat in there is still ample cargo space behind the third seat.

There is also separate controls for the air/heat and the radio... those in the front won't freeze so those in the back can feel the air!  There's also a feature which would allow the passenger seat rider to plug in headphones to listen to a tape while those in the back listen to a CD or vice versa.

One other thing I thought was neat... there is a pre-installed mirror for viewing those in the back.  This is great for keeping an eye on your little ones while you're driving!

My parents also just got a great deal on 0.9% financing for 60 months!  I think they paid around $27-28K but I'm not sure about that.  Dad recommends looking up the dealer prices either on the Internet or in an Edmunds book... this way you know exactly how much the dealer is being charged for the vehicle so you have a bit more bargaining power.

Can you tell I just love this vehicle??? 

I forgot to mention that my parents older Villager (I think it was a 1994) had just shy of 100,000 miles on it at trade in and the only maintenance issue they had was a recent air conditioning problem.  The reliability is one reason my parents chose to buy the same model.
