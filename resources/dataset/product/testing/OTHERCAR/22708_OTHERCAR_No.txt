            I bought this car brand new. It only had seven miles on it when I took it home. Within two months the brakes started pulling to one side and squealing. So I took the car in for service and was met with horrible service. I was told that my car would be ready by noon that day. So I called at noon and they had not even started to work on my car. I figured okay everyone makes mistakes so they told me my car would be ready by four ,and four came and went. By seven that evening I was pretty steamed about the whole affair. When suddenly they pull up to drop my car off. They had no explanation other than it was my salesmen's fault. Couple of months pass and the car starts eating gas by the gallons. I was getting about 14 to 15 mpg and the car was making a strange noise from the rear. I took the car back to the dealership to no avail. They said that they could find nothing wrong with it. So I took it to another dealership in the area,and they told me to bring the car in on empty for the weekend. So they could take a better look at it. Well that friday came and I took my car in just as they asked. They gave me my rental car with the usual stipulations. Don't let any unauthorized drivers use it and fill the tank up when you bring it back. I took the car back on monday morning and picked mine up. They had the nerve to try charging me the nineteen dollars in gas that they ran out testing my car. Their excuse was there was nothing wrong with the car so I should pay for the gas. Two months later the car was acting up again backfiring and sputtering all around town. The car had about 14,000 miles on it and they wanted to charge me 99 dollars for a tune up. I mean if the car had maybe ten thousand more miles on it, but it did not. They told me the oxygen sensor had went bad and replaced it,but insisted that it was somewhat normal for the car to need a tune up. I probably would have been better off keeping my 12 year old toyota. The car started leaking oil by the late 20 to early 30 thousand miles and was still under warranty so it was fixed free. I went through two more oxygen sensors and a leaky cam seal by this time I had enough. I had enough at this time and begged the people at the local dealership to help me get out of this car,but they wouldn't help. So I started looking through the paperwork from when I bought the car, and to my surprise the window sticker from the car was from a plymouth minivan. I paid over 15,000 dollars for a neon with no extras. The dealer said I got a great deal on it,but offered me cash back off the extended warranty which had expired. The dealer I bought this monster from was under investigation by the state for selling salvaged title cars and has since went out of buisness. So think wisely before buying your next chrysler car because they lack in every aspect of service imaginable. <br><br>
