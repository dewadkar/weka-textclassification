            This summer I purchased a new Pontiac Sunfire GT - 2Door Coupe.

I must say I love it so far.  The price for the sporty coupe with 250 horsepower engine was good, and the car is lots of fun to drive and it's a treat to look at.  I get a lot of compliments on it, especially the metallic fern green color, which is really distinctive.

The GT model has the 2.4L engine, which makes it powerful for sporty driving.  It corners well, and has safety features of anti-lock breaks and airbags.  It has alloy wheels, which add class to the vehicle.  The gas mileage is acceptable.

I haven't had any mechanical problems yet - but a few flaws that the dealer took care of.  These included 1.  passenger door seal coming off.  2.  Water in the middle break light (under the spoiler).  3.  Sun roof inner cover off the track - here's a tip - make sure you don't open the sunroof without opening the cover - it'll get off the track - and you won't get it back on without having a mechanic deal with it.

There are a few cons with this car.  The back seat is very small - if you've got kids you won't want this car.  But for a single person who doesn't use the back seat often it's fine.  The front seats are very comfortable.  

The front seatbelts seem short, especially if the driver is short and has to have the seat far forward.  This is a common problem in 2-door cars - the belts attach to the car frame, which is far back in a 2-door, and they don't use longer belts.  If you're hesitant to wear it due to it being too tight, you can get a free seat belt extension from your Pontiac dealer.

After driving a Honda sedan for 8 years, I really enjoy the Sunfire a lot more!<br><br>
