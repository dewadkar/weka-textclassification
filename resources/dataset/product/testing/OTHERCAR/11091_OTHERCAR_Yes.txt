                 Ok here's the deal....I just moved to Los Angeles and i've found a job at an upscale Santa Monica hotel as a valet parking attendant.  Its not the most glamorous job, i agree, but i do get to drive a lot of high-end automobiles( and i have to make some cash for now).    Ok so i've driven quite a few Audi TT's and I'll tell you a few things you must know.

1.  We all know it looks great,  its a fantastic classic design that is sure to ingratiate itself on any driver

2. When you sit inside this thing..(assuming you're under 6'4&quot;)   you will not want to get out of it.  It has the tightest &quot;cockpit&quot; feel, everything is right in arms reach and its beautifully designed.  The classic chrome odometers laid out across the dash will make you feel like you're in an old porsche speedster .......definately a german car

3.  It does have some 'pep', but its not quite a porsche boxter, it shifts tight and easily, handles like a dream, and well.....lets just say &quot;tight&quot; is the all around feel of this car.

4.  Last but NOT least,  i hate to tell you this guys....but you MUST know this.....   This car may soon become a &quot;chick&quot; car.  I've been seeing more and more women driving this car around L.A. and i'm sure the trend will catch on.   I know this looks like such a fun car, but think about if you can handle driving a &quot;chick&quot; car.  Just thought i'd warn you about it, and don't say i didn't warn you!


    ....and to wrap things up,  the 2001 addition of the audi &quot;quattro&quot; all wheel drive is a plus.  That means extra traction control for you.  Drive it, enjoy it,  but if you have a thing about &quot;chick cars&quot; stay away from it.  You don't want to be stuck in the next miata rich upper middle class women
