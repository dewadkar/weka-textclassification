            Recently I began doing comparison work and research between a variety of different full size pick-ups and mid-size SUV's.  I am currently driving a 1999 Toyota Tacoma PreRunner.  While this has been a good truck it is only regular cab and I need both the shoulder room and a rear seat to carry more than one passenger.  I had at first naturally considered either a Toyota Tundra or 4Runner but quickly abandon this idea primarily because Toyota just wants too much money for not enough features.
When it came to the Chevrolet line I had initially only considered the extended cab Silverado.  But while out on a local Chevrolet dealership lot I noticed several two door Blazers.  I decided right off that I liked the style of this SUV, at least in the two door version.  I decided to do a thorough test-drive and review of it since it did meet all of my criteria.  I could carry more than one person, still have room to carry large items and most importantly have adequate ground clearance in the event of poor weather.  When you work for an emergency service as I do there is no staying home on bad weather days, you have to be able to get to work.
Upon seating myself in the vehicle I found that not only could I carry more than one person but they would also be very comfortable.  The seats in the Blazer are very well designed and very comfortable, both front and rear.  The power adjustable driver seat on the LS model I test drove was a nice added feature.
The comfy seats coupled with the superb ride quality of the 2WD LS version were easily on par with many of todays top notch SUVs.  At a highway cruising speed of 70 to 80 mph there was almost no road noise and ride comfort was excellent.  This SUV is built on a truck frame, (the way an SUV should be in my opinion), so don't look for any sports car like handling.  The rear end can get a little loose over rough pavement but after driving the vehicle for a few weeks this is expected and easily compensated for by good driving technique.  I'm not one of these &quot;car guy&quot; critics who believes every vehicle on the road should handle like a Ferrari but off-road like an Abrams battle tank.  
The 190 bhp 4.3 liter V6 engine has more then enough power to merge into Interstate traffic and gets relatively good mileage considering the type of vehicle this is.  The Vortec engine delivers a great low end torque and prevents drivers from having to run the motor out just to get around town.  This also has the effect of saving you some gas, a real plus.
The dash layout and instrument cluster are very well done.  I like it much better than my Toyota which I find to be &quot;oversimplified&quot; when it it comes to ergonomics.  In the LS version the six speaker CD / stereo delivers great sound and is fairly easy to learn how to use.  Four wheel disc brakes with ABS standard is a great feature as well and I'm glad GM is offering it.
By far this vehicles greatest plus is the price tag.  The two door, 2WD LS version that I test drove featured tilt wheel, power windows and locks, 4 wheel disc/ABS, keyless entry with integrated alarm system, six speaker stereo, power adjustable driver seat, touring suspension, 4 adjustable overhead lamps for both front and rear passengers and of course the 4.3 liter V6 for only  23,500.  This is an excellent price considering how much many of the competitors ask for similarly equipped vehicles.  To my knowledge no 4Runner will roll off the lot with this many features for only 23,500.<br><br>
