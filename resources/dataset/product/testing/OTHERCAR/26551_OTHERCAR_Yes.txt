            My son assured me that Chevrolet Pick-up had very good resale value, this helped in my decision upon chosing another Chevrolet. I leased a 2000 s-10 pickup and I love it!!! It is very economical to drive, and being it is my only vehicle to drive in the winter, (I store my 1992 Camaro)I am very well satisfied with the cab and feel very cozy in it. It is my first &quot;NEW&quot; vehicle in a long time and I couldn't be anymore happy with it. I would recommend an s-10 to anyone in the market for a small pick-up. I have had mostly chevrolets since my first vehicle in 1968 a brand new 350 chevy camaro and although I have ventured away from chevys in the past, I always comeback and with the purchase of my lil' truck, I'm glad that I came back again. Nice Job Americans, You still do it BEST!!!!<br><br>
