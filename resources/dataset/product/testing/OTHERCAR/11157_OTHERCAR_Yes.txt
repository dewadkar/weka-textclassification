            I was looking at the Siennas and love the space but I was thinking that with the higher then usual fuel rates lately why not go for something a little more efficient then a van. Mind you, I am still a huge fan of Toyota vans after owning one since 1988 and piling up more then 300,000 miles(including four coast to coast trips at 6000 miles RT per) proved to me that Toyotas are simply built to last. I have yet owned a vehicle that can hold up to that kind of punishment. 

I knew I would be buying a Toyota but I just didn't want to go all the way down to a car so I test drove a 2001 RAV4 with the 2.0 fuel injected four cylinder automatic. It has a sun roof, power everything, fold down and removable rear seats, CD, cassette, AM-FM stereo, cruise control, the works. Total price with tax tag and delivery $22,399.65, oh yeah, that was after 6 hours of haggling with the salesman. I still can't believe you have to haggle so much for a new car, what a pain in the caboose! Other then the stupid price bickering(he still made money off of me) the buying experience was top notch. The car was delivered to my house at no extra charge by the dealer.

I love all of the storage areas that were designed into this mini-SUV. I was concerned at first that I would be missing all the cargo area of my original van having only half of it's cargo space to play with in the RAV4. This turns out to be unwarranted, with careful packing you can fit a enormous amount of gear in this little SUV. The four cylinder really holds it's own even when loaded down with gear and air conditioner running full blast. I haven't towed anything yet but you wouldn't want to tow anything past a trailor with jet skis or small pop-up camper with this vehicle anyway, it's just to lite. 

The wide track makes this vehicle very stable even through the ground clearence is really high. The ride is a little more stiff then the Siennas that I drove and the steering wheel seems unusually small. The tilt steering has very limited adjustment about 2 inches up or down. In the full up and full down position of the steering wheel you still get unobstructed view of the instrument panel. The security screen that covers the cargo area behind the back seat won't tilt up all the way so it can be a pain sometimes. So, that would be the only real complaints I would have about this vehicle.

If you are a van owner like me there are some things to get use to when scaling down to a smaller vehicle. This vehicle is a mini-SUV in all it's different aspects. If you need cargo and passenger space then you will want a mini-van or better to keep you happy. Like I said my priorities were fuel economy with gear space for my out door lifestyle.

So far I have really loved the 2001 Toyota RAV4(had it for 5 months now). The fuel economy is right on the money and that is exactly the reason I purchased this SUV.
