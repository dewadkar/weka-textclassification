            The Forester--a great car, great performance, great price! For under 23 grand, you get a 4 wheel drive, powerful all terrain vehicle with many added benifits. This car drives like a dream, it's much smaller than other SUV's, and you can clearly see better from the rear window. The car doesn't have sharp handling, however one downfall is that it doesn't have the smoothest ride. What's great about this car is it will drive like a Jeep or Lexus in snow, rain, sleet or on a beautiful dry day. The car can come loaded with luxury items or can have the bare neccesities for still under $23,000! This car is great for teens, it will hold whatever they want to because the trunk is extra roomy. This car is a car for all ages, adults, teens, and senior citizens will love to drive this fun car, and hey it's pretty damn good for $23,000 fully loaded!<br><br>
