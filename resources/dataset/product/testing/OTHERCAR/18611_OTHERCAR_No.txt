            I bought a red two door 1999 Alero GLS in Feb of 99 for myself after I graduated college.  (If only they had taught me these things in school).  I loved the car when I got it.  It's so good looking, great to drive, it has a fantastic stereo, comfortable seats, lots of room for a two door.  Those are all great things about the Alero, but you can enjoy those on the test drive.  Make sure you give it back to the dealership after that! We were comparing the 2 door V6 Accord and the new Toyota Solara with the Alero.  We couldn't figure out why anyone would spend the money on the other two...they were more expensive, had less horsepower, and didn't look as good as the Olds.  I should have bought the honda.

Within a month of owning the car, the driver side window would roll itself all the way down whenever it felt like it.  This wouldn't have been so bad had it not been 35 degrees outside and it was sleeting out!  So thus began my first trip back to my dealership. (little did I know)  They disconnected the switch and ordered a new part.  I came back in 2 weeks later when the part was in and complained that it was making a "wierd noise" when I turned left.  (I'm female, I should have known they wouldn't listen) They told me they put the car on the stand and looked at it and couldn't find anything wrong.  Oh well...at least my window was fixed.

About a week later I was walking out of a restaurant to my car that was parallel parked at the curb.  My tired were cut in toward the curb and low and behold there was my funny noise...hanging from my front left axle.  Do you know that plastic meshing they put underneith sod to hold the rolls together? Yep...there was an 18 foot long sheet of it wrapped around and around and around my axle.  Sure they put my car on the stand and looked at it.  The stuff was hanging onto the street.  I used scissors to cut the stuff off my car and put it in a garbage sack.  My husband returned from overseas a few days later (he's military) and took the bag to the dealership and had words with the manager.  We started visiting a different dealership after this for our many repairs to come and at least we were treated with respect.

My next problem came when the leather emergency brake boot ripped.  It was replaced 3 times in 2 1/2 years.  They just couldn't get it right. 

My next problem was my emergency brake.  It just quit working.  We got that replaced.  

At the same time as the problem with the emergency brake, I had the stereo replaced.  It would make my CD's skip and it would not eject them unless it wanted to.  Thankfully, this was replaced as well.

Then, in September of this year with only 38,000 miles on the car, it wouldn't start.  My battery was dead.  Not too bad, right? Wrong.  It wasn't just dead...it had leaked ALL OVER THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT!  It was towed to the dealership and replaced for free.  Thank god for small favors.  (Once again my husband was out of the country and I was faced to deal with the dealership on my own!)  I brought the car home from the dealership thankful that at least it was just the battery.  A few days later after my husdand had returned, he noticed a large blue stain on our garage floor.  I knew that my windshield washer fluid was empty even though the guy at the dealership claimed to have filled it up for me.  It turns out he did fill it up for me.  Too bad that the battery acid had eaten up the tank to hold it, along with the pump, along with the hoses, along with a foot in diameter section of red paint off the engine compartment.  

Thankfully, this was all under warranty.  My husband kept complaining of a wierd noise coming from the front right tire, so again we went to the dealership.  They didn't know what was wrong with it.  They said the tires needed to be lubed (WHAT???) because it was slipping on the rim and making a noise.  We went through this 3 times.  They kept lubing my tires (were they stupid??) they even called GM headquarters to see if they had further suggestions.  They said to lube the tires.  My husband (who restores cars as a hobby and knows A LOT about cars) told the guy that the roters were warped.  They swore they weren't.  It's nice to hear that other people had problems with their roters.

At this same time, my exhaust manifold was leaking antifreeze as well.  

After only 43,000 miles and 32 months of ownership, we finally got rid of the lemon Alero.  I didn't want a car that was unreliable, under warranty or not.  We paid extra for the 48 month 48,000 mile warranty and used every penny worth out of that extended warranty.  We probably would have had over $2,000 in repairs had we not extended it.  I was paying $497 a month for this car and it was at the dealership at least once a week.  I didn't want to be stuck making those kind of payments with a warranty that was quickly dwindling (we went on a 4,000 mile trip for Christmas, and it would have finished up our 48,000 miles).  We got rid of it in November of 2001 for a 2001 Acura 3.2 CL Type S.  

It's a shame that the car went bad...I loved that little red Alero...it was so fun....for a while!
