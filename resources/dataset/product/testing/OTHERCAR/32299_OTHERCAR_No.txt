            I bought my 1999 Sentra GXE this February and am kicking myself for it.  I bought it because my then-fiance (now wife) got herself a used Pathfinder and the dealership said that they'd take good care of me on a new car.  My 97 Prizm (bought new) was out of warranty and in need of some repairs, and I wanted a car with a stick, so, I swapped it.

Let me say outright.... I LIKE small, cheap cars.  I may dream of BMWs, but I don't choose to afford them.  The Sentra gets us from point a to point b with a minimum of cost or inconvenience.

That being said, here's what it's like.....

This is a SMALL car.  Legroom is fine for me (5'5&quot;), but my 6' tall dad looked quite scrunched up when he had to drive it.  The car, however, is very narrow.  Maybe it would be okay if it was an automatic, but it's not very comfortable for my wife and I to sit next to each other.  (we're both a little bit broad-shouldered, but we aren't hulking giants or anything).

The ride is harsh.  Not harsh like a Jeep Wranger, but harsher than our 4x4 Pathfinder, and harsher than either a 97 Prizm or a 1999 Corolla.  Noise levels are not too bad, but there's a lot of wind noise.  It sounds like there's faulty weatherstripping, but everything looks fine.  

The CD stereo is mediocre.  Fine for music at reasonable levels, but not fun to turn up loud.  Reception is okay for both FM and AM, but not amazing.  It's about what you'd expect from a cheap car.

With a stick, it's quite fun to drive.  There doesn't seem to be a lot of torque at low RPMs, but as you get the revs up, it starts to pick up.  The Sentra isn't a sports car, but it's a lot more fun than the homely exterior would imply.

So why don't I like it?  First of all, it feels cheap in a way that Prizms and Corollas don't.  There's nothing that I can put my finger on, it just doesn't feel as good, and that's even though it's relatively loaded with goodies.  The real problem, though, is that I've had WAY too much trouble with it.

My 97 Prizm?  No trouble for 40,000 miles over 2 years.  My mother's Prizm?  1 broken seat belt over 45,000 miles over 6 years.  My wife's 98 Jeep Wrangler?  A loose dashboard wire, covered by a TSB--the only problem in a 15,000 mile year.

The Sentra's first 10,000 miles?
- Takes some fighting to shift into reverse (I haven't gotten this fixed yet)
- Broken front passenger window driver motor.  The part wasn't in stock and had to be shipped.  (remember, this is a mature model--the last year before the redesign)
- 2 tires damaged by road hazards (cost $100)
- Front right side brake caliper sliced by road hazard (would have been $600 if the dealership didn't write it as a warranty issue)

This car is driven on city streets and interstates.  In 8 years of driving before buying the Sentra, the only road hazard problem that I've ever had is running over a nail in my driveway, but I've had all of the above problems in the space of 10,000 miles.  Either I have become a HORRIBLE driver, or this car is simply not put together very well (and remember, I'm comparing it to a Prizm, not a Hummer).

All of that being said, it's a decent one or maybe two person car IF YOU BUY AN EXTENDED WARRANTY or you get a good one.  It sips gas (I hit 33 mpg, and I drive a little too quickly for maximum efficiency), it has an adequate number of gadgets, and the price is right.  

As a used car, I have a hunch that it'll be a pretty good deal, probably cheaper than a comparable Corolla or Civic. If you're buying an automatic, I'd try to pick up a 97 Prizm instead (they're cheaper than Corollas, even though they're the same car).  In a stick, though, the fun of the Sentra may outweigh the problems that I've had.
