            First, a disclosure: I bought a G35 sedan for my wife and very soon traded it in for an Acura RL. The basic reason was that the car&#146s ride is too harsh, jittery and nervous. The problem was that even on smooth freeway pavement, the car could make you nauseous if you are at all sensitive.  To put things into perspective, I&#146ve been driving 3 different 300ZX cars for the last 20 years (83, 87, 91) and generally love Nissan products, but the G35&#146s ride is too extreme for no good reason. I also drove the non-sport 2003 G35 coupe and its ride is even harsher than the sedan&#146s. In my opinion Nissan has gone way overboard in trying to make their new cars &#147sporty&#148, and they have lost the great ride and handling combination that existed in the last generation 300ZX, or is available in a BMW 5-series or Lincoln LS. The ride quality is important because most people buy a car for daily use and not for trashing the car for a week as done by some car magazines. 

The Exterior:
Styling is a personal bias. In my opinion the sedan&#146s styling is nice, but not drop-dead attractive. The front-end styling is fine, looking aggressive and sporty. The side view or profile looks like it belongs to a lesser car, not a near-luxury car &#150 but you can say that about all of the recent Infiniti designs. The rear view on the sedan is a disappointing and looks like an econo-box. The coupe rear styling is much better. Overall, the car exterior is very compact for the very roomy interior spaces. The pass-through trunk is very large. The engine compartment is dressed up, as is common today, but has one flaw: the oil level stick is a distorted piece of metal that&#146s difficult to pull out or put back in. The hood also doesn&#146t have struts and is held up by a rod. An observation that I haven&#146t seen elsewhere is that the engine gets awfully hot, to the extent that it&#146s too hot to touch the hood or fender after a long drive. This may have implications in the long run.

(The exterior styling on the G35 Coupe is near perfect &#150 it&#146s elegant, sporty and beautiful from all angles.)

The Interior
The first thing you notice about the sedan interior is its spaciousness. It has plenty of room for 6 footers both in the front and rear. Compared to other cars, the G35 interior is huge, particularly the rear seat (compare with any BMW except with a Long 7-series, I35, Lincoln LS, Acura RL, Cadillac STS). The basic car comes with many standard features, but I recommend adding the Premium package (about $2000) for the convenience of dual zone A/C, power passenger seat, 200-watt Bose premium audio system with 6 speakers and woofer, driver's seat memory with entry/exit assist, reclining rear seatbacks, auto on/off headlights, auto-dimming inside mirror, one-touch open/close rear windows, Home Link, etc. The only problem with the Premium Package is that it forces you to get the sunroof. I&#146d also recommend getting the optional real wood interior trim (about $250). The wood adds a great deal to liven up the interior and give the car a sense of &#147luxury&#148. Without the wood the interior can look blah, especially with the metallic color dash center console. I dislike the current trend of metallic or aluminum finishes in just about all new cars. It seems that car manufacturers blindly follow group-think and take any one theme to the extreme.  A &#147luxury&#148 car should look luxurious (a la Acura RL, Cadillac STS), not an industrial.  Otherwise the interior is well appointed and the switches and controls are large and easily accessible . Some professional reviews have complained about the placement of the power seat controls (at the inside edge of the seat) or the radio volume knob (on the right side of the radio), but you soon get used these. The power seat controls can be a problem if you are a laterally challenged person. The seats are very supportive and comfortable and hold you in place in hard cornering. Some professional reviews have also complained about the color of the instrument lighting (red-orange), but I love it. It reminds me of my first new 1983 300ZX, which had a similar red-orange color (BMW does not have a patent on the red-orange instrument lighting).  If you don&#146t get the NAV system, the interior will have plenty of storage room. The car does come with a standard compass to help navigate. I live in Phoenix AZ, and one thing you pay attention to is the A/C &#150 the A/C on this car is excellent, better than most American cars I&#146ve driven. If you choose the lighter interior color (Willow), take note that the material used on the headliner and the A-pillar and various other places is easily scuffed and the dirt shows. The seat belts are easily accessible in the sedan, but not in the Coupe (they get caught behind the front seats).

On the Road
I got the automatic because, let&#146s face it, it&#146s practical. Assuming I could shift with expert or computerized precision, I don&#146t mind giving up 0.1-second in the 0-60 time in favor of easier driving. Besides, the car does come with the step-up-and-down transmission shift (don&#146t remember the official name).  The car has traction control, which can be turned off. The handling of this car is excellent and lots of fun. Throwing the car into sharp turns feels secure. The handling of the G35 Coupe is even better and very enjoyable, given the additional power.  But let&#146s be clear: my &#147great handling&#148 evaluation is from the perspective of aggressive driving and driving for fun &#150 not driving the kids to school or the wife to the store. See my comments about ride comfort at the beginning of my evaluation. On rough roads or streets with uneven pavement, you&#146ll feel it all the road imperfections. Comparing the ride and handling to other cars I know: The BMW 5-series handles about the same, but has a much better (comfortable) ride; the Lincoln LS handling is a little softer, but the ride comfort is better. The brakes are very strong, but a little too touchy. You&#146ll need to learn how to slow smoothly without jarring your passengers. I&#146ve read that the front break rotors tend to warp &#150 if this is the case, it is reminiscent of the 90-96 300ZX. The turning radius if excellent, in fact it&#146s so tight it can make you dizzy if you turn fast, particularly in the Coupe. As for acceleration, this car&#146s speed build-up can be scary, especially in the Coupe. My gut feel evaluation of acceleration is that the sedan is just as fast as the BMW 540 (V8) or the V8 Lincoln LS. This reflects the excellent Nissan V6, with which I&#146ve had experience in my previous 300ZX cars. The engine is very smooth and quiet compared to any other 6-cylinder that I know. The road noise (wind, tires, engine) is reasonable, but not exceptionally low. 

Conclusion
This car is worth the money for what it offers. Given the price, the combination of power, handling, features, and near-luxury feel can&#146t be beat by any BMW or Lexus. The only gripes I have are the exterior styling (particularly the rear) and the harshness of the ride. Just these two factors were enough to get me to buy a V8 Lincoln LS instead (I did buy a G35 sedan for my wife, but traded it in as a result of the harsh ride).  Although I could live with the interior, in the future the interior material should be improved and aluminum finish should be scrapped.
