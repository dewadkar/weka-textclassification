            My husband and I both were looking for a car that was economical yet large enough for a growing family to start out with. We found a 1996 Saturn SL2 at a used car lot in town, and it was the best decsion we've mde. We purchased it with only 28,000 miles on it, and it was already nearly 4 years old when we got it. The car was in near perfect condition.

Make sure that Saturn knows you have the car. Call them with your registration and VIN so that they have a record of the owner. We bought ours used, but we were welcomed to the family with a handwritten card, and a package of goodies from the company. It was a greaat gesture...

The car is wonderful! It's roomy enough up front for our long drives from Utah to California, with lots of room for luggage. The back seats are a little cramped, but little people fit quite nicely back there, with room to wiggle. The trunk has plenty of space--we were able to put 5 large suitcases in there. 

We've had no problems with it at all in the 10 months that we've owned it, and we get lots of compliments on the pretty copper color. We have noticed, though, that there are lots of little chinks taken out the hood paint from rocks flipping off the road. The Saturn dealer gave us some free touch up paint, which was great. Also, a little water leaks into the trunk once in awhile, but it hasn't caused any damage at all.

We love the 60/40 folding seat in the back! It is nice for longer items in the trunk, while still having the ability to sit someone in the back seat comfortably. 

This is my first car, and I'm glad we found this Saturn. It's a great car, and hasn't caused any trouble. We especially like how the dealer and the company itself are so wonderful to someone who bought the car used! We have been treated like we bought it new, and we appreciate that.<br><br>
