            When I met my husband back in 1996 and he picked me up on our first date in a big Volvo 940 I thought to myself, &quot;What's a 24-year-old doing driving this old man car?&quot;  Luckily I didn't let a &quot;geeky&quot; car keep me from dating him.  And luckily my husband an I were in this car a few nights ago...

While my <i>motivation</i> for writing this review is how safe this car is, it wouldn't be a review if I didn't mention its other good and bad points as well.  If you're considering purchasing a '92 model, you're obviously not looking for state of the art features, and I think you'll be very happy with this car.

Epinions lists the 940GL as a &quot;near luxury&quot; car, and I would agree.  It's a big car.  Very big.  5 adults can travel in it quite comfortably.  The trunk is cavernous.  At 8 years old and with 130,000 miles, this car still provides a very smooth ride and is extremely comfortable to travel in.  After debating on whether to drive my VW Jetta or this car, we drove 600+ miles this summer from North Carolina to Massachusetts with no complaints from either of us about the comfort.  It has plenty of leg room without squishing the knees of any back seat passengers (well, only the dog on this trip, but he's important, too!) and seats that are cushiony and recline nicely.  This is definitely a &quot;trip&quot; car.


I also drove this car 23 miles each way into work daily when we lived in Connecticut.  While the 114 horse power engine in our non-turbo edition is a little weak for a car this big, it's sufficient.   No, you won't be winning any stop light drag races and there may be times when you wish it had a little more pickup, but you obviously don't buy a car of this size for performance driving.  I actually can picture my parents cruising around in this much more so than my husband and I.  

The power windows and door locks were a luxury on this car that I had not experienced with my old Geo Storm, so was really impressed with those at first. ;)  We've had no problem with any of the electronic features of this car - door locks, windows, sunroof - which seems to be a problem with the American luxury cars my parents have - they seem to always be getting the automatic window on their Buick fixed.  Other than routine maintenance, the 940 has not been into the shop as long as I've known it.

Our 940GL also proved to be a pleasure to drive through many a winter snow.  It has heated seats, which kept my little yankee-turned-southern-turned-yankee (and now southern again :) butt nice and toasty on the way to work each morning in cold CT.   Not being used to driving in the snow, I was very pleased with how this car handled as well.  And needless to say, Volvo has a reputation for safety, so I always felt especially <i>safe</i>.

But now the real reason I love this car:  it kept us from being seriously hurt or even killed in an accident.  We were driving home a few nights ago, and were just getting ready to turn into our neighborhood.  Around the corner from the other way appears a set of headlights coming towards us, in our lane.  The driver swerved to try to miss us, hit us head on at at least 45mph, and pushed us backwards at least 20 feet down the road.  (He was drunk, and fled the scene on foot through the woods, but that's a story for another epinion...)  The car was totaled - if you aren't familiar with Volvos, it's pretty hard to total one.  However, we walked away with minor aches and pains and badly shaken nerves.  I feel as if I owe my life to this car.  I'll miss it!

So, if you're considering a used Volvo 940GL, I highly recommend it.  Please also always wear your seatbelt!<br><br>
