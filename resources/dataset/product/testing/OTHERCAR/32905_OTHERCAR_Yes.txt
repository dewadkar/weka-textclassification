            The Canon S300 is a great follow-up to their S110. Although the S300 is slightly larger than the S110 and doesn't look as streamlined, it can take movie clips, which the S110 cannot do. The S300 also has better zoom abilities than the S110. Because the S300 cost only $20 more than the S110 at the time I was in the market for a digital camera, I bought the S300. It comes with one rechargeable lithium battery, one 8mb compactflash memory card, a USB cord, and a battery recharger.

Quality of Photographs:
Now the S300 is a very small camera, which is why it costs so much. If you are willing to carry around a larger camera, go with one of the other Canon cameras, such as the S30 which is approximately the same price and is 3.2 megapixels compared to the S300's 2.1 megapixels. That way you will get better quality photographs for your money. You can also buy a Canon digital camcorder, as those take photographs as well, but the photos often do not turn out well so if you are looking primarily for a photograph-taking device, don't get the camcorder.

Case:
The S300's high price tag does not include a case to protect the camera's metal exterior from scratches. If you want to keep your stylish little camera from damage, buy the SC-PS500 case from Canon to protect it.

Number of Pictures and Picture Resolution:
I always take my pictures on maximum resolution (1600x1200), although there are two lower resolutions that take up less memory. I also set detail to superfine, the highest detail possible. The Canon website says that on this setting, an 8Mg CompactFlash card will take approximately 8 pictures. It will actually take about 11. The 128Mg CF card I bought for approximately $70 through www.cnet.com held nearly 200 pictures, although the Canon website tells you it holds only 128 pictures.

Battery Life:
The viewfinder of the S300 is inaccurate. Using the LCD screen to take a picture is much more accurate. However, using the LCD screen also eats up your battery. I like using the LCD screen so for my 128Mg CF card, I bought an extra battery (Canon Lithium Battery NB-1L, 3.7V, 680 mAb) for approximately $30, again on cnet.com. 

Downloading your Pictures:
If you take pictures on high resolution with superfine detail like I do, it takes a while for the pictures to download through the USB cord. Although this was fine while I was stuck with the 8Mb CF card, once I got the 128Mb CF card, it took forever to download the 200 pictures I had taken at one time. I bought a Nikon EC-AD1 PC Card Adapter for $20 which downloads the 200 pictures in a third of the time. Also, if you take pictures on lower resolution, they download faster, but since you can then take many more pictures, if you use up all the memory before you download the pictures you will still have the same problem. I take this camera on vacations and cannot download pictures until I get home, so I found it worthwhile to pay for the PC Card Adapter, but it isn't necessary otherwise.

One more note about CF memory cards. The number of time flash memory can be overwritten is limited. After extended use, you may find that you can take fewer and fewer pictures on your CF card than before. Eventually, you will have to buy a new CF card.

All in all, I like this camera because it is small, easy to use, and doesn't force me to get photos developed so I can scan them into my computer. I would definitely recommend it, as long as you prefer it over the other better-quality but larger Canon digital cameras. However, there is the hefty price to be considered. You can get non-digital cameras that take much better quality photos for much less. Also, in addition to the price of the camera, you'll have to buy a CF card with more memory, and possibly another battery, a camera case, and a PC card adapter. If you can afford the hefty price tag, then this digital camera might be just what you're looking for in the way of size and convenience.
