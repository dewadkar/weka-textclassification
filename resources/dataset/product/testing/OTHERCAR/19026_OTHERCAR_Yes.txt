            This was my first digital camera and I wanted to replace my trusty and well travelled Olympus 35mm compact that I've had for over 10 years.  I was stuck between a digital camera and a full blown SLR &quot;analog&quot; camera until I discovered the C-2020 and saw how compact it was in real life.  The high resolution (1600x1200 max), full manual control facilities (plus aperture and exposure priority), larger F2.0 lens, 3X optical zoom and SmartMedia storage system were the main draws.  

On purchasing the camera I was immediately impressed by the ease of use, I could use it right away without even reading the manual.  Later on a half hour reading the manual and a half hour experimenting had me well versed on all the other advanced capabilities like aperture bracketing, exposure compensation, spot metering, panorama and rapid fire shots, long exposure flash modes etc. etc.  The list goes on and it has ever feature a non-professional photographer like myself needed.  Along with the camera I bought a 32Mb memory card (upgrading the 8Mb supplied) which is enough for 70 or more 1600x1200 images stored with JPEG high compression which is what I use most although its quite easy to switch resolution and compression mode (a lossless TIF mode is also available but it'll chew up your storage in no time!).  I also got a PCMCIA SmartMedia adapter card that makes copying images to your PC a doddle and virtually instantaneous, and finally a soft leather case to protect the camera.

The quality of photos I have taken is extremely good, bright, colour true and distortion free.  The resolution always amazes me since 1600x1200 is 4 times the area of a typical SVGA resolution image so there's plenty of room for cropping and enlargement. I've had greatest success with daylight photos since the camera is very light and hard to hold steady for longer exposures.  Also with the larger memory card its been easy to rattle off several shots to play with exposure and aperture to get the best quality, a luxury I seldom allowed myself with real film in my old Olympus.  The supplied software is adequate for most needs although certainly not as easy to use as the camera itself.  The best software was the auto-stitch software for creating panoramas which works really well and has effortlessly delivered some huge and very impressive sunset panoramas.

Saving the best till last... the ability to take short video sequences is great.  At high quality (320x240) you only get 15 seconds worth at a time (but more can be shot later once it is written to the memory card if there is space), or 60 seconds in lower quality however its a great little extra perk that gets some real &quot;wows!&quot; from people seeing them.  No, there isn't any audio which is a shame. 

The only negatives I have encountered are that 1) Olympus didn't think about supplying a leash for that lens cap that I've almost lost several times already in the last month (visit your camera store and buy one before you find yourself looking for a new cap), 2) it would be nice to have a physical button or knob to cycle through the quality modes rather than use a menu, 3) no audio for the movies.

Now I have bought a CD-RW drive for my computer to give me cheap permanent storage of all those image files I will probably never use that old 35mm camera again.  It served me well but the Olympus C-2020 has definitely delivered its digital successor.

September 2003 Update: this camera is still going strong almost four years later. Its been very robust and reliable.  If I ever replace it I'll almost certainly buy another Olympus digital camera.
