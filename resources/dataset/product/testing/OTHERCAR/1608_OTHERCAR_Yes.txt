            Finding a reliable car that is also a lot of car for the money usually involves a more significant outlay of cash.  The Chevrolet Prizm (formerly known as the GEO Prizm)is a happy surprise.  A good, steady, dependable car with much in common with the Toyota Corolla -- this car runs several thousand dollars less than comparable imports.

Two things were most important to us in our recent car purchase...we needed an inexpensive car and we needed one that would be reliable.  I was surprised to see that very few cars made the Consumer Reports list that met both those criteria and expected them all to be foreign cars.  With extended family on the assembly lines in Detroit it was a goal to find an American car that would fit the bill...and so far we have not been disappointed.

The back seat is fine for the kids.  Husband had to ride in the back recently and nearly bit off his tongue when the car went over a bump and his head hit the roof.  He is not a tall person, so be aware that the ride in the back may be too &quot;cozy&quot; for adults.

The car handles well on turns and quick stops.  We have not yet had severely cold weather, so I can't tell you how it works in that condition.
I am not happy with the windshield wipers, which do not offer more than two choices:  fast and very fast, but the heating and air conditioning both work very well.  Previous car did not have a light in the trunk, and this one does...so it is the little things that count!
