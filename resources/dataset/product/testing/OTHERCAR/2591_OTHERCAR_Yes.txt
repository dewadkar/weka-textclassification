            What does this slogan &quot;four-door sports car&quot; appear to you?  Well, that's Maxima as you may already know.  I discovered more than I expect after taking the wheeling for a drive.  Indeed, its characteristics make it fun to drive in any occasion. A spacious and well-designed interior really add up to convenience. 

Although the Maxima has the same shape from 1995 to 1999, but I still find it extremely distinctive and attractive. Only a few details like the grille, trim, and wheels have changed over the years.  It has a long hood and short rear deck for a front-wheel drive sedan.  Beside that, it has a body-colored bar across its grille, alloy wheels, and a wing-type spoiler on its trunk. 

Furthermore, the Maxima is a comfortable car with a fashion interior designed that gives excellent style and function.  It pleased me for its supportive front sports seats, a leather-wrapped, tilt-adjustable steering wheel, and good shift level placement are standard, allowing me to do some serious driving.  Also, its easy/simple controls and useful storage spaces make the Maxima an easy car to enjoy driving. The back seat is very spacious, never had to worry no enough room for my 'big' friends to fit in. 

I feel that the Maxima SE delivers great fun on a twisty mountain road, with smooth and firm control over the wheels.  It also works in wonder when I curving through streets with busy and tense traffic.  My Maxima can come to a complete stop quickly with its four-wheel disc brakes, well, that's necessary for a fun and safe driving experience. 

I especially love the Maxima's engine with 3.0-liter, 190-horsepower twincam V6. It's lightweight and make soulful music when driven hard,  giving the car a great sporty character.  I don't feel frustrate with the stop-and-go traffic anymore now with Maxima's light clutch and good low-rpm torque. 

Overall, if you are looking for a four door sporty car, the 1999 Nissan Maxima SE will hit you on the light.  You will most possibly be pleased and satisfy with its luxury comfort with excellent performance.  I personally rate it, &quot;Best driving experience yet!&quot;
