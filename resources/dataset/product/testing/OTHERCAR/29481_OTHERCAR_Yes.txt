            I bought my 99 Jeep Wrangler used this last July 2001. It had about 40,000 miles on it and exhibited the normal wear and tear of a two year old vehicle. I had considered a purchase of a four wheel drive vehicle for the past two years. I had been driving a two wheel drive pick up truck since moving to Utah. I enjoyed my little Toyota, but needed something that would get around in the mountains and snow better. I really had not considered a Wrangler because of it's impractical appearance, but once I drove one and took a closer look, I had to have one. Not only is it a blast to drive, it looks fun, acts fun and goes ANYWHERE. 

The model I bought is a Sahara edition 4.0 Liter with a 5 speed manual transmission, airconditioning, and the upgraded interior package which includes a soft top and a fiberglass hard top. The fact that this vehicle came with two tops was a real bonus. The first day I bought the vehicle the hard top came off and went into a storage locker. The soft canvas top, which is easy to set up, went on, but was never fully enclosed for 5 months. I live in the Salt Lake area, and summer weather keeps the outdoors warm enough to go "topless" for many months. 

After a few weeks of driving topless on the freeway, I got up enough nerve to actually take the Jeep off road. I was a bit apprehensive about taking an $18,000 daily driver off road, so I decided to take it easy and go into a canyon that was known for gravel roads. Corner Canyon near Draper Utah was exactly that - an easy drive up the canyon - with little requirement for four wheel drive. I did however find a little Jeep road that started off climbing easy, and then turned a corner and began a climb up a 20 degree slope. Well this climb was a bit intimidating to me at first, a normal car would have never been able to climb over the volleyball sized rocks and foot deep ruts, but I put my Wrangler in 4 wheel drive low and I was simply amazed at how the little Jeep just dug in and made short work of this mountain. After that climb, I was convinced that this little Jeep really more of a mountain goat than a car.

Since then, I have forded streams, climbed over small boulder, driven through 3 feet of fresh snow and enjoyed many drive in movies with the top off. What a blast I have had in my Jeep.

Drawbacks: Don't plan on carrying much of anything big without an aftermarket rack of some type. I had to buy a rack that mounts to the spare tire to carry my skis. The backseat is no place for adults on an extended trip, although perfect for kids, luggage or the dog. My 4.0 liter engine can be a gas guzzler, but really gets you ahead of traffic on the freeway ramp. Highway noise with the top off can preclude you from hearing anything except noise - unless you buy an aftermarket stereo with some serious wattage. 

If you like to customize your cars, Jeeps have what seems to be the largest aftermarket parts and accessory catalog anywhere!
