            I have recently acquired the Fuji FinePix S3000 & so far I'm very impressed with its quality & features. This is a Camera that suits the occasional user as well as the more enthusiastic Photographer.

With 3.2 Megapixels there is enough resolution quality to produce a good 10 X 8 Photo, at least as good as most 35 mm Cameras.

The best feature of the S3000 is the 6 times optical zoom lens. A massive bonus if you like a bit of distance between you & your subject. I like to take candid photos of my Family & Friends & this lens is perfect for that. Most Camera manufacturers are charging in excess of �300 for one with a 6 times zoom & I paid �200 for the Fuji.

There are plenty of other useful features which I will probably use at some point. For example manual overide, the ability to choose the aperture & shutter speed is very useful in certain poor lighting conditions or action shots.

And it has Video mode but without sound, this can be run for up to one minute.

The Automatic setting would suit most photographers who are not looking for variable lighting effects. Its very easy to use, just point at the subject & squeeze the button. But do this carefully to avoid Camera shake which causes blurring.

There is a big bright adjustable LCD screen at the back which you can use to Pan a scene & select your subject without the pain of looking through the viewfinder. This will reduce the battery time but this is not a problem if you use rechargeables.

Through the viewfinder you will see an electronic image which changes according to the light. There are ways to change the graphics of this window by adding vertical & horizontal lines. Very useful for centering your subject.

The Camera takes XD Memory cards which I understand are faster than others at processing the image.

It looks the part resembling some SLR Cameras. Good quality silver plastic. When the Finepix S3000 is slung around your neck you look like you know what you are doing.

There is also a nifty pop up flash which must be operated manually ( slightly inconvenient ). However this is seems to be quite bright & was more than adequate for indoor nighttime photography. Without the flash its still possible to take indoor photos which look more natural but beware of Camera shake.

With a 64 MB XD card inserted its possible to take over 60 high quality pictures. The 16 MB card that comes with the Camera is far too small, only around 16 images at highest quality. I paid an extra �20 for the 64 MB card.

The Camera comes with a lens hood, lens cap, batteries, a 16 MD memory card, a strap & comprehensive instructions.
