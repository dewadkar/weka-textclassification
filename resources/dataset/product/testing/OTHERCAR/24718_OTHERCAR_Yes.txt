            When searching for the right digital camera, it took me a bit. For the prices some these cameras command, I wanted to make sure I�d get a bang for my buck. In the end, I chose on the Sony DSC-S70 for its picture quality and advanced features.

STRENGTHS: 
1. When it comes down to it, the primary thing to be focused on is the picture the takes. How sharp is it? How is the color quality? The answer: Amazing. The camera contains a &quot;Carl Zeiss Sonnar Lens&quot; which I had heard some very good things about. Carl Zeiss is world famous for high quality microscope and camera lenses. After I got the camera and compared it with a couple of my friends� cameras, I can tell you that there is a difference. It produces some of the sharpest pictures and the color quality is equally comparable.

2. The camera�s top resolution is 2048x1538, which is 3.3 million pixels. Pictures taken at this resolution, although being of excellent quality, can get quite large limiting the amount of pictures that can be stored in the cameras memory. I tend to shoot everything at 1280x960 and the images produced by the S70 are sharp and vivid. Adding to the quality is the camera�s 6X zoom (3X optically with the rest provided digitally)

3. Another plus for the camera was the extremely low learning curve to begin using it. I tend to use things right out of the box before I get around to read the manuals. Some of the more advanced options like the ability to capture short MPEG movies require at the very least, a quick reading of the manual.

4. The new S70 user interface is really quite good is very easy to setup and control. The color LCD panel on the back of the S70 features crisp resolution and is easily visible except in extreme sunlight.

5. I have to say that one of the nicest features of the camera aside from the picture quality, is the� Smart&quot; battery. This nifty feature is a battery meter can accurately tell you how much battery life is remaining and works very well too. Gone are the days of guessing how much time you have left.

WEAKNESSES: 
1. The time it takes for the camera to start-up, can take up to 7 seconds. There is also a delay of approximately 3 seconds between pictures. The delays can mean missing an important shot if not waiting for it.

2. The shutter lag is something I found to be a little annoying. A little tip to get around this is to hold the shutter button half way, wait for the &quot;green&quot; light, and then snapping a picture almost instantly. 

3. The Sony DSC-S70 is a very sturdy and well-built camera. Mine has had its share of accidental drops and bumps but has prevailed. This may sound like a plus but the sturdiness has also made the camera a bit large and bulky. Add the battery to the camera and it can be one of the heavier of the 3.3-mega pixel digital cameras. 

Overall, the camera provides excellent picture quality and ease of use at a lower price that some of its 3.3 mega pixel counterparts. The advanced options and smart battery add a lot of usability countering the cameras slight bulkiness.
