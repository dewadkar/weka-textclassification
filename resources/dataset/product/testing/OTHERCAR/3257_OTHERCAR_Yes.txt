            I have never been more impressed with a car than I am with my VW Cabrio. It is very roomy, safe and great fun to drive. In fact I have a hard time getting to drive it anywhere because my passengers always want to know if they can drive it. Before I bought this car I drove the Saab 9-5 convertible and the BMW Z3 and found didnt find either of those to be as fulfilling as the Cabrio. Also, the Cabrio is a great buy for the money and easy to fix small problems without the help of a mechanic. I would not recommend this car if you regularly drive people that need to ride in the backseat as it is a 2 door coupe and it's not very convenient to have to pull up the front seat to let people get in the back all the time. so this is probably not a good choice if you have kids. i also think the cabrio is no longer considered a girl's car. I have met many men Cabrio drivers on some of my favorite driving roads and they love their car just as much as I love mine!<br><br>
