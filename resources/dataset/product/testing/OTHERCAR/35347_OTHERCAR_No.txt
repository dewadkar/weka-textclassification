            In 1996 I needed a second vehicle.  I had a 4 door sedan and wanted something larger.  I looked at SUV's but found them to be more like trucks with limited cargo space and in some instances very uncomfortable.  I am tall (6'4) and need amble leg and head room.  But a mini-van semed to be a family vehicle and my wife and I had no intent on raising kids.  But we love to camp, and to shop, and to drive (just us or with family/friends).  We though we would just test drive a van or two and were immediately sold on the Chrysler Town &amp; COuntry Lxi.  WOW  and after 4 years we are still thrilled with our vehicle. Oh there are a few quirks...but they are minor - which car is perfect?????The Chrysler T&amp;C Lxi has become our main vehicle.  Its features are excellent and we feel like we are driving a high-end european limo!!  We have had very little trouble with it and highly recommend it to all.<br><br>
