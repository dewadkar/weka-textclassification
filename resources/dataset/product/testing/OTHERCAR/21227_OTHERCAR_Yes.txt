            What do you think you would rather have. Well if you wqanna drive around in something that breaks down every two seconds then you should get a Taurus, cause like I always say in my reviews on cars, whatever you do, dont buy a Ford( unless it is one of there SUV). The Ford has so many negative qualities on it, it is amazing.

The Camry is the obvious choice in this situation because it is reliable, comfortable on long trips and is good for a family or if you are single. This car has never broken down on my me, and is one of the best cars I have ever had. toyatos are the easeist cars to deal with and are very reliable. I love toyatoos so much and you should do.

I recommend this car definitely to anyone who loves driving in a comnfortable smooth quiet car.<br><br>
