            I bought the Toyota Sienna just last May and it is an excellent vehicle. I bought the CE 5 door version. With the MSRP base at $22,858 we got it at $21,989 with no optional equipment. Destination charge was an additional $480.

If you have children this is a good family vehicle. It can accomodate up to 7 passengers.

The standard engine on this model is a 3.0 L V6 four speed. It is adequate but a little more power would not be so bad. The horsepower is 194 at 5200 RPM (revolutions per minute). The fuel economy is not that bad on this vehicle which gets 18 miles on city/24 on highway.

If you get the optional towing package, you can tow up to 3,500 pounds. Normally without this upgraded package, you can get about 1,000 pounds. The second and third seats can be removed if you need the extra cargo space.

The standard audio system on the Sienna CE is okay but nothing special. It includes a Deluxe 3-in-1 audio system with CD player. Some other standard features contain automatic transmission, air conditioning, passenger side airbag, rear defogger, power steering, and driver side airbag.

However, many things can be added for an additional price. These items include power mirror and locks, heated side mirror, cruise control, and keyless entry unlock.

Here are some interior dimensions:

Head Room (FR/Rr) 40.6/40.7
Leg Room (FR/Rr) 41.9/36.5
Shoulder Room (Fr/Rr) 60.4/62.1
Hip Room (Ft/Rr) 58.7/63.2

If you have researched a little, you might have found out the interior dimensions of other passenger vans. Compared to other, I would say that the Sienna is in the middle. It is not the biggest but not the smallest. That is probably how I sum up the vehicle as a whole. There are better vehicles on the market, but you have to spend a little more for them and there is no one vehicle that is the best in every aspect.
