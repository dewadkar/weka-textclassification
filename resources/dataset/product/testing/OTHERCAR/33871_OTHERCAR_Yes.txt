            <b>Greetings,</b>
Way back in 1994, my wife and I bought a new 1994 Toyota truck.  The 2-wheel drive flavor.  Emerald Pearl in color.

Emerald Pearl?  &quot;What in the world kind of color is that?&quot; you ask.  Well, the easiest way to describe it as follows.  It appears dark green in daylight and black at night.  My wife loved the color and it was the color that helped it sell quickly (yes, we committed a sin and sold it! :(  Children were on the way and we *thought* we needed a mini-van ... woe upon us, the mini-van was a mistake!).

Why new?  Well, it was hard to find a used one at a much better price tradeoff!  It seems that these trucks hold their value well ... or used car sellers in our area are greedy! :)

Now, on to the attributes of the truck!  If you had to sum it up in two words, it would probably be &quot;no frills.&quot;  Don't take that negatively.  It was a cheap truck, capable of hauling some things but don't try to lug around a piano!  It isn't a 4-wheel drive so stick to roads and highways.  It didn't have power windows or locks but you could easily roll the window down or lock the door by merely leaning over.  Ours came with a sliding back window and a bumper (can you believe they sell these things without a bumper!).  Ours was a 5-speed standard transmission which gave you a little more control.  The stereo with cassette only blared through two speakers.

&quot;Tim, are you really Crazy?  Why are you saying no frills?&quot; you plead.  Well, you simply get what you pay for.  A simple little truck that performs well.  It won't take you weeks pouring through the manual to figure out all the buttons and electrical gadgets on the truck as they don't exist.  This is great for you minimalist types but &quot;gadget freaks&quot; (and I use that term affectionately as I am one of those when it comes to computers and software) will be sorely disappointed.

The truck did have nice &quot;get up and go&quot; in its acceleration.  Probably due to the fact that it is light weight since its engine is nothing to brag about to your cousin in Missouri.  With the rear-wheel drive though, you needed to be a bit careful not to &quot;zoom-zoom&quot; too much and start imitating a fish! 

The interior of the cab was adequate.  Don't count on a lot of storage space behind the seat unless you get the extra cab.  Also, the bench seat can be a pain if you have a height disparity between driver and passenger (when my shorter wife is driving, I get to know my kneecaps a little more intimately than I would like!).  Also, I don't think the steering wheel was adjustable, it needs to be if it isn't.

<b>Some advice:</b>
. Get the bedliner BEFORE you scratch up the bed! :)  We went with the Toyota brand one and it performed well and was extremely durable.

. When buying new, bring a big red sign that has the word &quot;NO&quot; printed on it.  When the salesperson starts asking about &quot;rust inhibiting&quot; and &quot;undercoating&quot; and &quot;whatever else we can toss in to charge you more&quot;, hold up you sign and smile.  We blew it and got some of these and reaped no benefit from them.   The resell price after a couple of years did not change a bit!  So, listen to Nancy Reagan and &quot;just say no&quot;!

. If any of your drivers are taller than 5 foot and 11 inches, spend the money and get the extra cab.  This will be more comfortable in the long run since it is a bench seat.

. Enjoy this fun truck if you buy one ... and don't sell it unless you absolutely have to (or you upgrade to a Tundra!!).

<b>BottomLine:</b>
If you need a simple utility and transportation truck, the smaller Toyotas are an excellent value.  You can find a used one that is reasonably priced (warning - the used Toyotas seemed to be priced high here in the Northwest, so shop cautiously).

&quot;Is CrazyTim just blowing hot wind about this truck?&quot; you ask.  Actually, we are looking for a good used one to replace the one we sold!<br><br>
