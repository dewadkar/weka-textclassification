            The C280 is basically an entry class version of the luxurious Mercedes Benz line. However, you will find that you will not get an entry class experience with this car.Recently I have purchased a C280 it is equipped with sun &amp; moon roof, leather interior, and a bunch or other buttons to push. Just about every feature in this car is useful, including the power seat adjustment. Handling wise, this car was a dream. It was extremely smooth and responsive. I tell you the truth when I tell you that I would often have no idea I was driving 80 mph. The car handles so well that you think you were driving 30 mph. If only all cars could be this smooth. Your friends will even enjoy riding in this car as there is plenty of leg room in the back, despite the compact size of the vehicle.It is a good car for the price and it will last you many years do to its high quality construction which Mercedes-Benz is known for.
