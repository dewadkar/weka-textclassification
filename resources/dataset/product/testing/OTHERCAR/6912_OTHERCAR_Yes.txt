            I want to like this car.  60 - 70 mpg, what's not to like.  A car without the guilt of forever damaging the environment.  I want to like the Insight, I really do.  Trouble is, I don't think I would want to own one.  I have had an Insight (red) for one week now, and I will be a little relieved to get rid of it.  I suppose if I was more convinced that the Polar ice caps were REALLY  melting, I might consider purchasing an Insight. 

The Honda Insight is not a bad car, in fact it is quite fun to drive -  of course there's the great gas mileage.  The Insight handles like a life size go-cart, I'm just not sure go-cart handling everyday of the week would be fun or tolerable.

Inside the Insight there are all the familiar Honda touches.  Near perfect ergonomics, quality materials, and a bit of pure functionality make the Insight a shoe in for best alternative vehicle.  Seats are thin, yet incredibly comfortable.  The electronic, digital dashboard, although gimmicky, is functional and easy to read/use.  Generally unheard of in an economy car, climate control is a nice addition to the otherwise minimalist interior. On the other hand, lack of cruise control in a car long distance commuters will want, is a serious flaw.  Large cup holders ensure that a quick trip to In-n-Out Burger won't result in spilled cola.   Bad news for audiophiles, the stereo on the Insight is the worst sounding I have ever heard in a new car (built after 1983).  Even with the bass turned all the way up, the speakers still sound weak and flat.  A CD changer is optional - it couldn't hurt. There is some storage space, maybe enough for a weekend run up the coast, but not much more.

On the road, the Insight rides like the sports car it could be.  Acceleration is adequate.  Push the accelerator to the floor and the Insight really comes alive, there is a creepy quality to  the quiet quickness.  You won't win any drag races, but getting on the freeway will be no trouble.  While not incredibly quick, I was able to get the Insight up to a brisk 102 mph on flat roads. Even though the gas engine is only 995 cc, Honda quality makes it smoother than many larger gas engines.  The ride is very choppy at times, but handling is excellent, much like the go-carts at your local mini-golf course.  Now if only there was a 2.0 L VTEC under the hood.....  Oh well, dreaming is fun.  Around town that previously mentioned creepy quiet is appreciated.  However, on the open highway, the quiet gives way to road noise aplenty.  Lack of sound padding = light weight = super high gas mileage. You can't have everything.  The Insight's light weight makes for some tense moments on windy days at highway speeds. Running the A/C feels like someone left the parking brake on half way. Come to a stop with the clutch out, and the shifter in neutral, and the "autostop" feature kicks in.  The engine will turn itself off, then come back on when the shifter is moved into gear. 

One final note: The Honda Insight will get you noticed.  If you like to talk to strangers, this is your car.  I must have explained how the Insight worked, and what it was, a thousand times or more.  I love to talk about cars, but even for me it was a bit much. 

Overall the Insight is a decent car with excellent gas mileage and adequate acceleration.  Long distance commuters rejoice, you can save money.  Around town, or as a weekend car, the Insight also shines.

I am recommending this car only on the condition  that it would be a commuter or second, weekend car.   I simply could not recommend it as a persons only car.
