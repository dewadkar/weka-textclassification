            I just bought a 1999 A4 2.8 quattro w/tiptronic.  The A-4 is overall a great car and I agree with most of the positive comments of the other reviewers.  I'll focus on the one minor negative point.  By all means, it is still an excellent car.

I feel that the 2.8 w/the tiptronic auto trans is a little sluggish.  Especially off the line.  Hopefully, the S4 will solve some of this with it's twin turbo's.  In any case, there is a supercharger available for this car through PES. www.pes-tuning.com and it seems like a pretty solid upgrade.

Other than that, the car is simply excellent.  Large trunk, neat headlights, great sports and all weather package, and overall great ergonomics inside the vehicle.  The BOSE stereo system is highly recommended, since it's hard to find an aftermarket radio with the same dimensions to replace it.  That also serves as a good theft deterrent, since the radio is unusable in almost any other car.  I'd buy the A4 again in a flash.
