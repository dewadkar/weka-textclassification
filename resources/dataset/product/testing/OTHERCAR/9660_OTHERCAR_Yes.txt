            The 1997 Dodge Neon is a sporty looking car with the kind of legroom you would usually find in a larger sedan.  Chrysler Corporation makes the car and it comes in a variety of strikingly bright, luminous colors that seem unique to the Neon.

It is equipped with, typically found in most cars these days, a tightly fitted front-end four-cylinder engine.  Even with a tight fit, the engine was designed to make it easy and convenient for anyone to perform routine maintenance like checking the fluids, battery and hoses.

Many of todayï¿½s small engine cars allow for higher acceleration quickly.  However, because of its limited horsepower, going faster in a Neon requires some patience on the part of the driver.  It rides smooth and is a breeze to handle when it is on the open road, but in the city with stop and go traffic, steering can require some effort and the car is slow-moving when proceeding from a stopped position.

Chrysler is said to be improving the overall suspension in its later models.  Which accounts for why at times you will feel the impact when road conditions are less than ideal.

Compared to most new cars the Dodge Neon is economically priced at the low end, the mileage is good both in the city and on the highway, and finally it has the feel of a durable automobile.  Would I trade mine in today for a new one?  Probably.
