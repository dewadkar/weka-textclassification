            We bought our Subaru Legacy Wagon in '95 because we liked the look and because we had read that it was a good car. It's a station wagon, but it's got to be the best looking station wagon out there. It has a distinctive body that gives it a sporty look -- we have the luggage rack on top and I think that improves it's appeal.

More importantly, though, it has proven to be a very reliable car. The maintenance we've done on the car has been the standard stuff -- brakes, tires, oil changes, etc. Nothing major. This year we paid for a tune up -- the most we've spent on the car since we bought it.

It's taken us to Yellowstone and it's taken us lake fishing in the middle of a blizzard. I'll never forget the lake fishing trip because it was miserable BUT our Subaru wagon got us out while many of the other outdoor enthusiasts in bigger, meaner SUV's were stuck. We stopped to help push on several occasions and never got stuck once. The All Wheel Drive is a must-have for anyone interested in driving in snow. 

It's also pretty roomy for a car that handles as well as it does. We've got two car seats in the back. Our 2 1/2 year old sits behind the driver's seat and we have a rear-facing infant car seat in the middle of the back seat. We're able to get another passenger in the back as well as plenty of stuff in the cargo area. For some reason we've got more strollers than kids and we can get any stroller combination that we feel we need for whatever outing we're headed to in the cargo area without any trouble. 

This car has been good to us. It's taken us back and forth from California to Utah countless times since '95. If you decide to get the Subaru Wagon, the luggage rack is great -- get a cargo net to go with it and it will take you anywhere you need to go and it will carry all your gear. 

Did I mention that it's great in the snow?<br><br>
