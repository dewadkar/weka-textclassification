            Lately, I have been car shopping with some of my family and friends.  My friends all want me to get some kind of sports car, and my parents just want the car to be inexpensive and work well.  Since I want both, I am thinking about getting this car.  It only cost about 29 thousand dollars.  Which is pretty good in my budget.  It also rum really smooth, as I found out test driving this sporty car.  The only thing I dont like, is that it only has room for 5 people.  I wish they would make a really cool car w/ more room for passengers. You should buy this vehicle if you have the need for speed, and don't need a lot of people riding in it.  <br><br>
