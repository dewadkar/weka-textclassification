<b>How I Got My First and Only Saab</b>
During my junior year of college I commuted in a 1982 Oldsmobile Omega. This was not a good car. The 1982 Omega featured the infamous Chevy-built 2.8 liter V-6: probably <b>the worst engine ever</b>, as it's often sited. I bought this car from one of my father's coworkers. But this car was very well taken care of. Not a speck of rust was to be found; the interior looked as if no human had graced its presence; all maintenance records were in order and detailed. This car was supposed to last me until I landed my first job, and then some. But it didn't. Granted, the car ran flawlessly for the first six months I owned it, but then it began to turn against me. The radiator went ka-boom in the middle of Boston; the air conditioner was so powerful it turned the car off; if I was going up a hill, in winter, I had to turn off the radio, heater, and rear window defroster to have enough power to climb the hill. It was an under whelming car.

The car soon began to die a quick death and that's when I was on the lookout for another car. Again, another of my father's coworkers decided to assist me in my quest for reliable transportation. Ha! Anyway, this friend had another friend who had a Saab for sale. And for the sake of story, let's just say that this friend of a friend was shifty.

The Saab was kept at this friend of a friend's work, a Sunoco station where he was a mechanic. He showed me to the car. It was covered in "clever" bumper stickers and there appeared to be a young tree growing through the engine bay. But I was hopeful, sanguine. I took the key from his meaty hands and turned the ignition. The car grumbled to life right away. I shifted into first gear and drove around the gas station: a very thorough test drive.

We told him we would take it. The cost was $900.

The mechanic who owned the Saab said he just had to find the title at his house and that he would pass it along to my father's friend who in turn would pass it along to my father who would hopefully pass it along to me.

One month later...

I received the title. It was a little suspicious. The name signed on the back was not the mechanic's name, but a woman's name. And then there was the date. The date was off by 10 months: dated 10 months earlier. What happened? Was there some sort of shift in the space-time continuum that I was not aware of?

I brought the title over to my insurance agent and she looked the title over and said, "Well, the Registry probably won't even notice; in fact, if they do, they will just assume she's old."

Okay.

<b>The Bad Saab Mechanic in Newburyport, MA</b>
He was a bad man, a real bad man. Here's my little story: My car wouldn't start, or more accurately, it started but intermittently. As my spider sense tingled I determined that this was a problem. So, I drove down to my trusty local mechanic and relayed to him the problem at hand.

A few hours later I received a phone call from the very same mechanic, my mechanic. He stated that he didn't really know what was wrong with the car. He confessed to me (although I am not a priest and he is not Catholic but Muslim) that he didn't work much on Saabs but that he had the name of a very good Saab mechanic.

As soon as he revealed to me the name of this Saab Master Mechanic I called and told this Swedish automotive sage my story. After concluding the phone call I was on my way to Newburyport, almost 13 miles from my house.

Two days later the Saab Master Mechanic called my home to tell me the car was ready. After much excitement and washing of hands, I asked my father for a ride to the garage to collect my car. Little did I know what was in store.

We arrived at the garage a short time later and the Saab Master Mechanic greeted us warmly. He grabbed the keys to my car and showed me what I had hoped for: the car started, right away, the first try. Victory was mine.

Then the bill came.

What the problem was with the bill was not the price; it was actually low, especially for a Saab, but there was an extra item added into the grand total that called my attention: a towing charge.

<b>A Very Short Play</b>

ME
"What's this towing charge? I drove the car here."

SAAB MASTER MECHANIC
"Well, I often drive home the cars I'm working on, and your car died in my driveway, and I had to have it towed."

ME
"You're charging me for your tow?"

SAAB MASTER MECHANIC
"Yup."

ME
"But I told you the car was having trouble starting. Why would you drive it home?"

SAAB MASTER MECHANIC
"It's how I work."

ME
"But that doesn't seem fair."

SAAB MASTER MECHANIC
"Alright, you don't have to pay the towing charge, and if you don't, you can never bring the car back here again."

At this point my father interrupted and said, "Okay, fine, here," and paid for my towing charge. I never went back to the Saab Master Mechanic. On the way home I stopped by my regular mechanic and I told him, "Look, I don't care if you have to work from a book, I'm not going back to that Saab guy." I then told my mechanic what had happened at the Saab guy. My mechanic apologized for the unpleasantness I experienced and said he would do his best with my Saab. What a guy. And boy, did he make some major mistakes.

<b>Radiator, Starter, Alternator, Battery, Fuel Pump, and Breaks</b>
Unknown to me at the time, my newly purchased Saab had been dormant for quite some time. Dormancy is just about the worst one can do to a car. Parts, major and expensive parts, corrode and deteriorate. I drove my Saab for approximately one month before it turned against me, several times.
	
First, the radiator went. No problem: I got a used one off dadï¿½'s co-worker and dad installed it. Thanks daddy. The starter was next, which was misdiagnosed by my mechanic, and I ended up with a new alternator. Then the starter was replaced, but this was undermined by the fact that the battery was now dead. Off to the Sears Auto Center I go! Die Hards, please. Now the car could produce and use electricity. Another attack on my bank account quickly followed as a faulty fuel pump (the one in the gas tank--Saabs have two fuel pumps) choked my car into submission and left me stranded at work on a cold New England winter night. Daddy!

<b>Final Tips and Good Things about Saabs</b>
50/50 reliability. Saabs either last forever or fall apart. That's just the way it is. Of course, people of higher incomes will have a much better time with their Saabs since they can afford the high maintenance bills.

If you're buying used, make sure that the car was well maintained. Of course, this goes for any car, but with Saabs it's especially true.

Saabs don't rust easily.

You too can often put high mileage on a Saab. I've seen Saabs with well over 300,000 miles on their odometers, and they weren't even being being towed.

Join a Saab club and learn to do some repairs on your own. You can get factory parts for cheap, real cheap. This will save you money, lots of money.

Comfy seats. It's like driving around in your living room, if your living room is very small and encased in sheet metal.

The engine doesn't leak. Despite the fact that my car had all these aforementioned mechanical problems, the engine itself was always reliable and never leaked.

Spacious engine bay for you to work in, if you like doing that sort of thing. I tried to install spark plugs once and didn't tag the spark plug wires and reinstalled them into the wrong positions. That was a rough start.

Dipsticks for everything, even manual transmission fluid; large funnel-like caps, so it's easy to add fluids.

<b>Postscript</b>
I taught my girlfriend at the time how to drive stick in this dear old Saab of mine. We went to school together, and after the spring semester was over, she went home to Maine. I drove my Saab up to Maine every other weekend to see her.

Halfway through the summer, I received a "letter" from her and it was not "good news." She announced that she had gotten a new haircut and was now a new woman, and I was history. Yup.

The Saab soon bankrupted me (new breaks: $700) and I had to sell it. My parents had been assisting me financially for the upkeep of this car, but I felt bad that it was costing so much money. I sold the Saab to another of my father's coworkers for $500. He belonged to a Saab Club and he got the car running fine and dandy. He discovered that the fuel pump in the engine needed to be replaced. Cost: $25.

Damn it.
