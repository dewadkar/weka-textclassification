            I must admit the Dodge Ram is the most beautiful truck on the road. If not a bit aged. I recall being a young lad in the great city of New Orleans when I was first graced with the presence of a newly designed Dodge Ram. We were in awe, ever since then I have taken the time to point out a Dodge Ram on the road. I even wanted the baby brother of the Dodge ram (the Dakota) when I turned 16, but fate lead me to the topless Jeep Wrangler (also redesigned in '97).

I have two sources to go by. One a good friend of mine I keep in contact with in New Orleans. He is a proud owner of a black, 98 Dodge Ram, 3500 quad cab. He loves it to death...who couldnt. It has the goods, lift kit, mud tires, light rack, KC's, chrome trimmings, the total package. You will be hard pressed to find a better looking truck anywhere. I feel proud just to ride in it. The truck is only two years old though. It does find it's way in the shop a good bit <i>already</i>. He has taken it on probably on the average of about once every two months. But the problems have only yet to begin as you will see in story numero dos ;)...

Now to my good ole' Georgia pal. This friend of mine drives a green, 96 Dodge Ram. It is a good looking truck comfortable and fun. But it has problems, major problems. You see a fact about Dodge trucks is after 60,000 miles the transmission loses its mind. It is possessed, by what I do not know. This is something my previous friend has not found out yet, due to the youth of his truck...and I dont have the nerve to tell him yet. I have personally witnessed the transmission stick on the interstate, catch on fire, and even freeze. The older Ram finds it way into the shop for some <i>major</i> work probably once a month. And it will soon be retired by my friend.

The Ram is roomy for a truck and a comfortable ride. You can find better performing trucks than it but not better looking. If you are in this price range I would suggest the Tundra, which is the best truck on the market. There is no denying the good looks, and Dodge fans will not be deterred from their beloved company, but it boils down to the fact that you will be absolutely sure, there will be problems...down the road...<br><br>
