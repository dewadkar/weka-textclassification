<TEXT>
            The first car i ever got in my life was a 1990 acura integra with relatively low milage at 57,000 miles at the time that I bought it.  It took me one year of saving my money to get enough money to afford this car and i could not be happier.  I've now had it for close to three years and besides getting new brake pads nothing has gone wrong with it.  It has a very comfortable ride and gets good fuel economy.  It is also easy to drive and has nice pickup for a car this small.  I would suggest an integra to anyone.<br><br>
