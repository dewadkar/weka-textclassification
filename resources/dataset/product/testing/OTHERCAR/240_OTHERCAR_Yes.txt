            I have used a Nikon Coolpix 950 before & upgrading to the G1 made me realise how "primative" the 950 was! The G1 has all the features you'll ever need in a camera. The picture quality is very good.

The lithium ion battery that comes with it seems to last forever (even with the LCD screen switched on all the time). Together with an IBM 1GB Microdrive, you will be able to travel (& snap away) for weeks without ever running out of memory.

The swivelling LCD screen is just wonderful. You can take pictures from practically all angles!

The hotshoe for external flash is also great. No longer are you stuck with the internal flash (which invariably gives horrible results). I use my G1 with a 420EX flash & the results are just fabulous.

3 major complaints I have are:

The camera doesn't come with any pouch/case. Not even a soft case! You would've thought that at this price Canon would've had no problem throwing in a cheap soft case.

The metal casing is scratched very easily. I mounted my G1 on the tripod for a couple of shots & found huge scratches at the bottom after I removed the tripod.

The mode dial on top of the camera has a little "finger" sticking out to make it easier for you to turn the dial with your thumb. Unfortunately this cannot be locked in any way. Many a time, I found that I accidentally switched the camera on while stuffing it into the case (which is not designed for this particular model).
