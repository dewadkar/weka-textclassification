            As I'm no electronics pro, it doesn't take much to keep me happy when it comes to gadgets. The Olympus D-560 does just that, and I have hardly any complaints about it.

As for the camera itself, it's pretty sleek, and not too clunky. The fact that it has 3.2 mega pixels is a main selling point for this camera. The picture quality coming from this camera is much higher than a lot of other cameras I've seen before. 

I like that the camera has features that are easy to use, such as flash setting and the zoom. There are other settings on the camera for people who are more geared toward photography, such as sepia and black and white finishes. Some other neat components of the camera are the ability to shoot videos and a slow shutter option.

Uploading pictures on to your computer is a breeze, and they have many options for you to choose once they're on your computer, such as editing tools and folders for storage.

I only had a few problems with this camera. One was that you can only shoot 15 or 20 second videos, and nothing longer. On top of that, there's no sound, which I was sort of looking forward too. 

The other problem I have is the battery life. This camera sucks batteries dry! I made the mistake of buying regular AA batteries, which would be gone in 3 days, even when barely using it. I learned that most battery power is lost when uploading pictures, so I decided to buy rechargeable batteries. Even now I find myself recharging them on a very frequent basis.

Other than those small problems however, this is a very good quality camera for the price.
