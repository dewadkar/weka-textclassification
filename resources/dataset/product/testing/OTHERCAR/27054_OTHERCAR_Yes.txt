            The Olympus 450 zoom is an excellent camera.  I have had it for about a month (1/26/00) now and have taken over 50 pictures with it.  Great quality of pictures. I spent a whole day online and in stores trying to find the perfect digital camera. There is no perfect camera out there but for someone who is new with digital cameras and has a bit of money to spend I think it is The perfect camera. I don't think I could have been happier with another camera! I have been doing nothing but sending all my friends the pictures.  Most recently I had a birthday party, up at school and I sent all the pictures to all my friends from home. They loved them! One thing that I don't like about it is there is no automatic flash but it does not take much effort to flick your finger and have the flash ready.  The other thing that I don't like about it is the fact that the batteries run out quickly.  I put the batteries in when I first got it and three hours later I had to change them.  <br><br>
