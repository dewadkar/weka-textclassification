            Let's get the bad out of the way first.  

1. The camera will break if you drop it on a hard surface.  I knocked mine off a chair seat and the plastic hinge on the swivle lcd screen split open. Still working on how Canon will repair it, but all the parts are removable, so hopefully it will not be expensive.  Still, not a good thing, don't drop it.

2. There are many options that need to be learned if you are going to move off the AUTO function... takes lots of practice...luckily the film is free.  Once mastered the camera will be much better and the con becomes a pro.

3.  While the camera does accept lens attachments, it will get pretty bulky with the adaptor ring and added lens.  Great option, but not something you can stick in your pocket once attached.

Now the good.

1.  Great battery life.  I thought I would have to buy an extra battery.  After 1000s of shots, I must say, I only ran low one time.  This battery lasts and lasts.  Simply recharge the night before going on your allday trip and you should be good to go.

2.  It takes movies!  Not video camera quality, but an Excellent option!  About 250K per second (4 seconds per meg).  'nuff said.

3.  Long exposure settings allow for night time shots, including star shots (using tripod and remote).  Oh, yes. It has a REMOTE.

4.  Great pictures.  Whatever setting I am on, I always use the super fine setting.  1600x1200 super fine takes great shots that print out great for the normal user and are easy to reduce by 50% to 800x600 for emailing great looking shots. 

5. Zoom works great!  My pictures taken with Zoom are fantastic.  I had a Kodak camera and the zoom shots were always blurry or worse than a normal shot in my opinion, so I rarely used it.  The Canon Optical Zoom setting produces great shots.

6. Great download viewing options.  You can buy a compact flash reader (about 30 bucks) which is easiest and fastest way to download pictures.  USB works well also, but is slower.  Viewing on TV is easy with the audio/video out cord, so you can show your captures on friend/family's TV while on the road.

Advice:

High-res pictures take 1.5 megs or more, so invest in a 128 Meg Flash card (only about $55).  I carry 32, 64, and 128 with me (but never needed that much storage...I do fill a 128 meg card in a day including 3 or 4 video clips).

Keep the strap around your neck, don't drop the camera.

Buy a back up CF card (you wouldn't go out with only one roll of film would you?)

Don't buy the extra battery until you are sure you need one.
