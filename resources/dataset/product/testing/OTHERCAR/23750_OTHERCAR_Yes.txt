            In April of 1999,I purchased a new 1998 Jetta GLX VR6.I bought the car in New Mexico where I was living at the time.I loved the look of the vehicle and all the great features it had.It came with a sunroof,AM/FM cassette,10 disc CD changer,P/W,P/L,keyless entry,cruise,tilt,and leather.With the V6 and the 5 speed manual transmission it was quick and drove down the road extremely well.It comes with an excellent drivetrain warranty that goes to 100,000 miles.I loved that car to death.It was fun to drive and it certainly turned heads.I didn't have a single problem with the car for the 1 year that I owned it.Well, every story has a flip side.In September of 99 I moved back to Michigan.Well,it was in the huge snow storms around New Years and through the rest of the winter that I didn't care for this car as much.In the snow,it handled poorly with its low profile tires and low ground clearance.That is the only negative thing I found about my VW Jetta.I would recommend it and buy another one in a heartbeat if I could have a 2nd vehicle for the snowy times.It was the most pleasurable car I have owned for overall satisfaction.<br><br>
