            Yes, okay, this car is boring.  Let's face the facts.  A friend of mine recently said to me, &quot;I thought you were going to be boring because you owned a Honda Civic.&quot;  

Beyond this, however, the Civic is a reliable, peppy little vehicle.  I have had no major problems with mine since I've owned it, and you can't beat the gas mileage (it takes me about $10 to fill it, while my friends with S.U.V.s groan about spending over $20).  

The Civic is perfect for city driving - zipping in and out of lanes, parallel parking, etc.  I would not recommend it for someone who frequently takes long trips, however, since it tends to get cramped or uncomfortable on lengthy drives.  Likewise, if you have a large family (3 people or over), you should probably opt for something more spacious.

My only major problem with the Civic is its acceleration: I have had trouble merging onto highways, as it tends to make jerky transitions into faster speeds.  

The interior is no frills, although it provides you with your basic needs.  This is a minimalist's car: it gets you from place to place reliably.  I would not call it a &quot;fun&quot; car, and it is certainly not a luxury vehicle.  I would say it is perfect for someone looking for a low-cost, reliable vehicle. <br><br>
