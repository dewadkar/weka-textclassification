            I had a Polariod PDC640 prior to this and liked it so, I decided to upgrade to this model through Polaroid.  I can honestly say that I like the features of this camera and, its performance.
The thumb wheel on the back that accesses the different modes on the camera is nice and, pretty straight forward.  Four different flash modes.  A macro setting for close ups.  What else could you want for this price?  The software it comes with is pretty easy to install and use too. 
The pictures print out nicely up to about a 5 X 7.
The only flaw is that this camera eats batteries up like you can't believe.  I had to go out and buy two sets of rechargable batteries so I always have a fresh set ready to go.
