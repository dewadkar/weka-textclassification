              Initially our leased 1999 Forester ran like a sewing machine with no trouble at all.  Then, after only 11,000 miles last Fall, a deafening roar began in the rear portion of the car.  The service man at Tony Moore Buick/Subaru in Decatur, Alabama where we leased the Forester told us that a bearing had gone out in the axle.  The time to repair the vehicle was relatively short (only hours) compared to the time it took for the parts to arrive. We waited for weeks!  Now, only months later, the same roar is coming from the rear axle.  Now the service department tells us that it's the OTHER bearing that's gone bad.  It is going on two weeks now we've been waiting for the parts to repair it.  While many of you may have a pleasant experience with the Forester, our's is less so.
