            In the movie La Passione Chris Rea describes his life long love for Ferrari. Italian cars invoke passion and the Alfa Romeo 156 is no exception. When launched in 1997 the only regret many Alfa tifosi had was that this car was designated by a simple number and not by the name of its spiritual predecessor: the Giulia Super. The latter was the first true sports saloon: a medium sized 4 door saloon, with an extremely powerful engine (100 DIN hp from a 1600cc engine was a lot in the sixties) and exceptional roadholding.

The new 156 lives up to the legendary Alfa Romeo name. With petrol engines from 130 to 200 hp and two powerful and torquey diesels all models perform top in their class. My choice was the 1.8 Twin Spark with 146 DIN hp. It is fast enough for a spirited drive, yet retains the right balance to benefit the fantastic suspension system. Once warm, the engine runs up to the 6500rpm redline spontaneous and effortless. To be really quick however, frequent use of the 5 speed manual is needen in order to keep the engine on song. Although the twin cam is never slow, real power comes in at 3000 rpm. The gear ratios are closely spaced, with only a 700 rpm drop between them. The gear lever action is a bit on the stiff side and does not like to be forced.

The suspension is derived from Alfa's GTV and Spider. Of course it is fully independent and the Italian specialists set it up in a way that the fact that it is front wheel drive can only be noticed on very tight corners and then only under full power. Even at high speeds in medium radius turns, the car remains neutral and responsive. With standard tyres and rims it becomes clear quickly that the tyres and not the suspension system are the restraint to higher speeds. Personally, I fitted 17&quot; Alessio alloys with Pirelli P Zero tyres and stiffer springs. With those the car is glued to the road. Both in standard and modified trim the car is tight but comfortable with no rattles or other noises typical for previous Alfa models. Previously I have driven VW Golfs (both the VR6 -owned- and the new GTI 1.8 Turbo -borrowed from a friend) and both come nowhere near the roadholding of the 156. Also compared to my old car, the 155, this car is a leap forward.

The interior of the car is well executed. Materials are of high quality, the dashboard is clearly laid out and both steering wheel and driver seat are so well adjustable that anyone under 6'3'' (185cm) can find a good driving position. The co-driver is equally well seated, also because the dashboard is recessed to give a more spacious feeling. The back passengers however, are a little cramped, although no less than in a BMW 3 series. The interior has some nice retro touches, like the round revcounter and speedo which are housed in individual 'tubes'. Auxiliary instruments are placed in the centre console and are angled towards the driver. The 'luxury' package on my car includes a wooden steering wheel and wood accents on the centre console an excellent aircon system, special seats and a ski hatch in the rear seat.

I bought the car because I wanted fast and fun yet practical everyday transport. I drive over 60.000 kms per year so I want to feel happy with my car. Alfa Romeo was my obvious choice since I already own three classic Alfa's. A sidestep to VW (even the VR6) was a deception. I was first struck by the exceptional design of the car and then by its road holding and its happy and powerful engine. I recommend this car to anyone who wants to drive a real sports saloon and who don't want to pay the BMW premium. I would not recommend it to people with large families.
