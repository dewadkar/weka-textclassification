            We leased this vehicle, for 2 reasons. 1) We have a large family of 6, and 2) We needed a new car. I would not have chose any other model. We were lucky to get plenty of options in our van, such as built in child seats, and air conditioning in the back seats that were self controlled. We also had a sunglass compartment with a cellular phone compartment.It also has a compartment for cd's and/or tapes. It has a lock on it so it has to be opened by key. In the far back there is a plug for flash lights, etc. that run off cigarette lighters. It also came with a jack that has a cute storage space for it, and the spare tire under the back flooring. This van was very spacious and it it seats 7. We have gone to the Drive - In and camping with our van. The seats come out for more room, and you can use the seats on the ground at the Drive -In.

There was 2 thing I hated about this vehicle and that was the floor rugs were light gray and got dirty very easily, and when taking out the seats, they are very heavy.

I loved to drive this van, it is great on gas and it is smooth driving. Our seats are very comfortable to sit in for long periods.And our children can adjust the back seats so they can lay back a little.

I think this vehicle is great for families with children, and/or people that that love spacious vehicles. This vehicle is not great for people that are into low driving and small spaced vehicles.<br><br>
