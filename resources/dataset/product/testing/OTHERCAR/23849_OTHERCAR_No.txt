               I bought the Mustek VDC-200 as my first step into the digital camera arena, so that I could try my hand
at online auctions, which are most successful when good photos are included with the item description.
What a mistake! Thinking that the lower price tag meant a good basic camera, I was disappointed.
After hours of adjusting the lighting and resolution, then going through the tedious software provided to
get my photos from the camera to the computer, I never could get a finished product that came anywhere
close to the quality of a low range 35mm. 
   After 'settling' on the best photo in the lot, no amount of reading, rereading, or tweaking ever got the photo into
a format acceptable for use at the auction site. In frustration, the Mustek was set aside until another
time, when I tried again. Unfortunately, the second try was worse than the first. The LCD function 
was not working, no photos could be captured, in other words, the camera would not work.
  It was returned to the manufacturer, who kept it for weeks, before declaring it to be in perfect 
working order. It was returned to me in the same condition as I sent it.  After many phone calls and a lot of time, 
the camera was sent back once again. Weeks went by before it was deemed 'broken', and a new one was 
sent as a replacement, at no charge.
   While I appreciate the gesture of replacing the camera, the new one is of no more use to me than the original.
I'm back to using a 35mm and scanning photos, until such a time as I'm convinced that a digital will do a better job.<br><br>
