            My husband purchased his 1998 S-10, step side about 2 years ago and absolutely loves it!  It not only looks great, but it's very reliable, durable, and handles great.  It has a lot of comfort features which make driving it like a walk in the park.  It has a light sensory button which automatically turns the lights on for you when it starts to get dark, bucket seats for a comfy ride, side visors to keep the sun out all around, an arm rest with lots of storage room, and a great factory sound system.  The only con about the truck is that the 4 cyl. is slightly underpowered, the the 6 is the best in its class.  I would stronly recommend the S-10 to anyone!<br><br>
