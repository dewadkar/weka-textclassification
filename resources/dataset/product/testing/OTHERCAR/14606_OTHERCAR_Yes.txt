            My current car needed some servicing so of to the dealership we went...long story short, they gave a service loan car. 

I took it on side streets and highway so I got a pretty good feel of it.

PERFORMANCE:
This little Toyota is a gem. It accelerates with the best of them with pep and sure-footedness. 
The sporty little 2.0 Liter 16 Valve 
4 banger puts out 148 Horsepower and 142 Lb. Ft. of torque, plenty for a trucklet of its size. Because it was a Front Wheel Drive model, I would imagine it performing better. It seemed comfortable cruising at 2500 RPM on the expressway. It easily passed traffic at 65 MPH without a problem. A bit more torque would be better for normal American driving though. The engine, being in a Toyota, seemed reliable and efficient. I really can't pick apart the fuel efficiency, I've only had it for a day so far. According to outside sources, it should get 29 miles to the gallon highway.

INTERIOR/COMFORT:
Overall it felt comfortable, even though the seats weren't as plush as I like. The fabric seemed a little rough for my feel. The dash is arranged well, with a small tach and a large speedometer. I was also happy with the little arrow pointing the direction of the gas tank door. The quality of the interior was pretty good. The color is calming and not dark. The trim around the radio, AC, and AC vents looks youthful and sporty, fitting right into place in such a zippy little truck. One thing that bothers me is the size. I know it is a compact, but compared to my Hyundai Santa Fe, it seems so tiny. So if you really like to do the outdoor thing, you might find it hard to fit a mountain bike or duffel bags into the tiny trunk. The passenger area felt roomy, the back seat felt more like a compact car than an SUV though. I did like that they moved independently. The AC seems a bit weak for a new truck. It's not very cold, I'm not sure about the heater, but that should work well. The engine is silent, except when the accelerator is punched, then you get a bit of a roar. Road noise isn't bad at all.

EXTERIOR:
It's cute...Too cute in my case. I prefer my Santa Fe, looks more curvy and sports like. Strangely, it reminds me of a Citroen 2CV. It has a short wheelbase, and a nice wide stance. It's not to tall of the ground, so I didn't see the need for running boards.

HANDLING:
Again, it's zippy and sporty. Takes curves with lower than usual body roll for an SUV, and the turning radius is nice and tight. I made a turn in my crowded cul de sac without having to shift into reverse. The steering wheel is a little small for my taste, but it feels light and fluid turning corners.

FEATURES:
The features were nice. It was a front wheel drive model coupled to a smooth 4 speed automatic, A so-so AC, a pretty good 6 speaker CD/Cassette, AM/FM radio with good reception, an optional sunroof, and tubular running boards.
