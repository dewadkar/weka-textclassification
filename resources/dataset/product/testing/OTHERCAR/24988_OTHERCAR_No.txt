            I drove the Lumina for 2 months while my car was in the shop following an accident. I got to drive 1998 and 1999 Lumina (primarily city driving and one 500-mile trip). I drove a �Base� trim with 3.1 L V6.

<b>The Good:</b>
Well, first of all let me tell you what I like about Lumina (it is going to be a short list). I like the engine sound very much. Low-speed acceleration is fine, apparently the low-end torque is there. The car feels solid.

The fuel economy is also great for the V-6 equipped car of this size, I average 25 MPG with regular unleaded (and some full throttle accelerations). The stereo has speed-sensitive volume control, but it increases the volume too much.

<b>The Bad:</b>
First thing you notice - huge amount of force you have to apply to the turn signal switch. It is not a horrible thing, except the fact that other cars feel much more refined in this area, it is just annoying. You have to apply too much force to pull the CD from the CD player after it ejects.

The materials look cheap, the car has a foot-activated parking brake and a column transmission shifter (so the car can sit 6 people). Because the front seat is a bench (designed for 3 people), there is no lateral support.

Also it's hard to see the shifter position, because the steering wheel blocks the view. The car's fit and finish - don't even compare them to the japanese brands. In turns, the tires start to squeak before they give up. The car is not very stable in turns, feels heavy. Sound system is OK, but I have to apply excessive force to insert the CD or to take the ejected one.

The engine (3.1 L V6) produces only 160 hp and 185 lb-ft of torque, even though it has a compression ratio of 9.6. A usual picture with old-style two-valve per cylinder OHV American engines � good low-end torque, but low power with high displacement. Japanese engines (Accord, Camry or Galant) produce 190-210 hp from 3 liters of displacement. And in excess of 200 lb-ft of torque. However, Lumina has good fuel economy, the engine is smooth and engine sound is pleasant.

Also in 1998 model when going uphill, the transmission sometimes shifts back and forth, also when you press the pedal to pass, there is a significant delay while transmission decides to downshift, which is not a good thing. In 1999 model I haven't noticed any delays like that - shifting logic improved significantly.

The most unpleasant thing happened when in the rain windshield wipers died. That was not funny at all.

<b>The Ugly:</b>
I think that Lumina is ugly (both interior and exterior). The fabric and plastic look cheap. But this is just my personal opinion.
------------------------------------------------
Engine: 3.1 L 160 HP V6.
Fuel economy: about 25 mpg - primarily highway driving (GM claims 20 (city)-28 (highway)).
Reliability: Car & Driver Magazine says that in terms of reliability new GM cars are very good. In two months I had only one problem � the windshield wipers died
