            I was all prepared to tell you how easily this vehicle drives and rides.  And even how easily it pulled a car on a trailer for 500+ miles...but now...I can really sing it's praises! As you know, Arkansas got a HUGE snowfall this week.  Our driveway is very steep...but no problem for this baby!  I couldn't believe it!  Before the driveway was even shoveled, the car just backed right up without so much as a swerve.  I was totally impressed.  We got this car, used, last February, so this is really our first experience with how it handled in weather.  We have put about 20,000 miles on it this year with absolutely no problems.  I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone who is shopping for an SUV.  Not too many people think about the Oldsmobile products, as they aren't advertised as much as some of the others.  But I suggest you go out and give it a &quot;test drive&quot;  you'll be impressed too. <br><br>
