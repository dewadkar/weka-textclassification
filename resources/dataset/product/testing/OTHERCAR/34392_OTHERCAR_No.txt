                 I leased a new Catera from Williamson Cadillac in Miami, FL in 03/98 because of recommendations made to me by friends who had just purchased one.  Needless to say, that was one of the worst mistakes I have ever made.
     The car made it's first trip to the Service Center in 05/14/98 after only 1438 miles.  From that date until now the car has been out of service 35 days and been in the Service Center 14 times.  The list of problems are as follows:
             Coolant leaks, CD player not functioning, loud ratcheting noises in door locks, door locks failing to open, AC not cooling, front brakes grinding/squealing, car failing to start, loose molding, sun roof inoperative, engines running very rough, front end shimmy, brake replacements, high temperature readings.
     The list of problems goes on and on and most have occurred multiple time.  Beginning many months ago, I've attempted to have this car replaced under the Florida Lemon Law.  I've filed complaints with the State Attorney General and the Better Business Bureau as well as General Motors. 
I had an arbitration hearing on March 23 in which General Motors offered settlement before the official hearing began.  They had 30 days to comply but all they have done since then was stall, usually by never returning phone calls.
     I have now retained a private attorney through whom I am fighting GM to do the right and proper thing which is to replace the car or buy it back.  However, the Lemon Laws are biased toward the manufacturer and anyone who wants a buy back or replacement stands to lose a lot of money.  This entire situation has been and continues to be a nightmare.  My outlay of money has been substantial.  Not only have I had to hire a lawyer, but I've had to rent cars, lose commissions on sales I never made because the car wouldn't start, spend time waiting in the Service Center when I picked up or dropped off the car, phone calls, etc., etc.
     As of May 4, 2000 the Catera has no air conditioner, faulty brakes (4 times now), the twilight sensor inoperable, loose molding again in two places, the battery light flashing on intermittently, brakes light inoperable and I could go on.
     If my letter dissuades even one person from purchasing a Cadillac then I'll consider this a success. 
     I have documentation for everything I've stated  <br><br>
