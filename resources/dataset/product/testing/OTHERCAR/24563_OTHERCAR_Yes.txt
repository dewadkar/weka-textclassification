            The $64K question is how well can GM imitate Japanese car manufacturers? I will attempt to answer that question, in the course of this and further reviews on the Chevy Malibu.

Yesterday, I took delivery of a brand new 2003 Malibu LS in Toronto. It has every option available. The optional list includes leather interior, power-everything, moonroof, keyless entry, foglamps, aluminum wheels, ABS, spoiler, A/C and premium stereo. GM is offering good incentives at this time in Canada. My car listed for$29.1K, and yet I purchased it for $19.6K - and with all taxes in, the full cash price was $23.9K in Canadian dollars (which is about $4.98 in US funds!). 

I've been driving mainly Honda products for nearly 20 years  (I haven't bought a domestic since 1974, which was followed by 3 European and then 3 Japanese imports) and my last car was a 1988 Acura Legend Coupe. It's a very fine car, and still has lots of miles left on it. However, I was curious about the Malibu's choice by JDPower as the top entry level mid-sized sedan for both initial quality as well as 3-year durability. So, I decided to check it out. I'd also noticed in the local papers that very good incentives were being offered. The combo got me interested. However, after testing one and being favourably impressed - I didn't like the insurance rates I was quoted. So, I backed off. As a result, I got an even better deal on the car, as well as on the insurance!

The Malibu is no Acura Legend. However, I've already been favourably impressed with several items. It is both quiet and smooth in its operation. NVH are well suppressed. The suspension is compliant, and the car changes direction nicely with minimal body roll or flex. There is good brake feel, with ABS. Even though the stereo only has 4 speakers, I like the sound. Although, it is definitely not a Bose or Nakamichi. It has a single CD and cassette, as well as radio presets. The seats are comfortable, though not nearly so cosseting as the Legend's seats. The driver-side chair is powered and adjusts 6 ways. So, a comfortable seating position is likely to be achieved. 

The 3.1 litre low-tech V6 engine has adequate low-end grunt (though it's no drag-racer) and the 4-speed automatic shifts smoothly. The car is very easy to enter and exit - unlike the Acura coupe. Frontal visibility is very good. There's a fairly good view out the back, through the centre mirror, which is a tad small - and the two side-mirrors provide good coverage. The interior is both simple and functional - with the large guages very easy to read - and all of the switchgear have a good feel to them. Although the gear is all simple and generic GM - neither does one have to deal with the frustrations of something complicated like I-Drive. There is plenty of front interior room, and a largish trunk, as well as a 60/40 back-seat split. 

The exterior styling is fairly bland - in a non-offensive kind of way. Of course, it only comes as a sedan, and has a marked and derivative likeness to many mid-sized Japanese imports. It is uninspiring, yet OK. But, I like the fact that it doesn't have hardly any chrome on the body, and the side-mouldings and mirrors are body coloured. My car has the spoiler, as well as 5-spoke aluminum wheels and all-season radials. 

So far, the performance is fine, and the car definitely has some dynamic capabilities - though they haven't been tested on any twisty roads as yet. The steering is fairly positive and precise. Although, it doesn't have any where near the sportiness of my Legend, it turns in fairly nicely, and changes direction with a minimum of fuss and absolutely no rebound, with minimal body lean. Freeway joints do not send much of a shudder into the cabin - which is equipped with two air-bags, up-front. I've read the safety testing done, and the results are fair to good. I believe it gets 4-5 stars on most of the tests. Apparently, that used to be a problem, but was corrected for 2003. One has to commend GM for upgrading a model the product planners already knew would be changed radically in the next model year. 

Since GM went to school on the Japanese imports in building the Malibu - one would hope, after 6 years of production, that GM would have learned a fair bit on such a good-seller, and would have improved it, accordingly, as best they could. That's my expectation, and my hope. Only time will tell, if GM can also imitate the quality of Japanese imports. Let's hope that the brothers and sisters at UAW Local 652 in Lansing, MI take pride in what they produce!

I will give an update on this review at 90 days - to see if I've changed my views in any appreciable way. So far, I'm favourably impressed - although it's definitely not yet a Legend - nor even an Accord! In fact, I've decided to make this a sort of on-line automotive diary - and so, will update from time-to-time, as the urge to do so arises.

MILEAGE UPDATE - DEC 11/03: I took the car out for a couple of fairly long highway drives - coupled with some around-town driving which ended up being about half and half of each. For Canadian readers, I drove 488km (which is about 305 miles) and when I filled up I put in 46 litres (which is about 10.1 imperial gallons). If I'm correct in calculating this - I think that equals about 10.6 litres for 100km, which is how mileage is expressed here in Canada. For American readers - I've calculated that the mileage is about 31mpg - but, as noted, that's for the imperial gallon, which we don't even use any more. The U.S. gallon is slightly smaller (for reasons I've never understood, even after 30 years here!). I'm not sure how these results compare to the Transport Canada or manufacturer's figures, but I'm relatively pleased. The Malibu's gas-tank is smaller than the Legend's - and so, the needle goes down quicker. I have to keep that in mind, as I watch that happen. 

On another pleasant note - I'm also really pleased with the stereo. I tweaked it a bit over the weekend - and plugged in the pre-sets, etc. For a fairly inexpensive factory installed unit - there's really rich sound. The CD really booms out the bass notes, and I tweaked the mid-range and tweeter, for really sweet results! 

Unfortunately, I've found that there isn't as much interior storage space as in the Legend - but, that's a really small complaint. There are also a couple of really small design flaws that I've noticed. The pictograms at the top of the dial, for the HVAC system, are partially obscured by an overhang from the stereo. When the gearshift is pulled all the way back into first - the lever/knob is very close to the console. There is barely enough space to put my hand. The same applies, when the car is in park - except then the knob is too close to the console. As well, it does not seem that the head-rests will tilt forward - althought they do adjust for height.

However, thus far, I'm really pleased with my new car. It was very quiet, smooth and comfortable on my recent trip. If the car turns out to be as reliable and durable, over the long haul, as the surveys suggest - then, I'll be a very happy camper indeed!

January 17/2004: Snow and deep-freeze alert!! Recently, here in the great white north, we've had a severe blast of winter descend upon us. We've had minus 30 degree celcius readings, when the wind-chill is included. As well, we've had blizzard conditions on a couple of occasions. I'm very pleased to report that the new Malibu has performed well, in these challenging conditions. I do have a garage, and have parked it there - and so it isn't quite as cold there as it would be outside. However, I haven't had the slightest problem starting the car, even though I haven't used the head-bold heater plug-in, as yet - and it's been parked outside all day at work too. Also, the car seems to move well enough in the snow, I've had to drive through some fairly deep drifts, and have done so without any problem thus far! However, I wish that the rear defogger had some sort of over-ride button to keep it on, since sometimes the ice will continue to build up, and the system seems to shut off automatically. As well, the driver's-side rear window seemed to remain fogged up, even though the rest of the windows eventually all cleared up. Also, I've noted that on REALLY cold days, it can take up to 15-20 minutes for the car to get nicely warmed up. That's considerably longer than the Legend took. However, on the brighter side, I have also discovered that one can achieve a very nicely modulated temperature, when cruising on the highway.

One further point about the car. With the very high winds we've been having, I've noticed that there can be some wind-noise through the driver-side window, if the wind is strongly coming from either the side or the front. Otherwise, under normal operation and wind conditions, the car is quite quiet. 

As a sidebar, the fuel efficiency seems to continue at about the same pace. I've now put just over 3000km on the car, and the few times I've checked it - the mileage seems to be about 10 litres per 100km, and that includes some all city driving.
