            I never bought this car thank god, but i did rent it when my honda civic was in the shop because some bastard ripped out my deck. Anyways, initially when i rented this car I thought "ah yeah, V6 engine, 200hp, this is gonna be sweet compared to my 106hp civic." When i left the lot I accelerated madly and I was quite impressed with the accceleration.  

However, when i got to my first intersection i leaned forward to peak at cars coming around the corner. unfortunately i hit my head on the roof because of chrysler ridiculously stupidly designed peice of crap sebring. The damn roof line is so damn steep that I'm not even laughing when I', typing this.  I am not even close to being tall, I am 5'8" and my seat was all the way back. After i regained consciousness i cursed at this car for about 5 minutes.

Also trying to shoulder check is ridiculous as well, looking over to your left all you see is the cheap interior plastic and your seatbelt. As well, another time i was waiting for my wife outside her work so decided to get a little shut eye. when it was time to get up, i sat up and pulled that lever to put the seat up. To my surprise the seat came up at like 50mph making me hit the steering wheel and almost setting off the airbag.

As well, in the automatic version, if you shift down to first gear to slow down, the transmission won't actually shift down until you hit the breaks, then your left with a horrible confrontation with the steering wheel once again. As well the cruise control is horrible, when you try to slow down the car by holding the coast button, the car doesn't even slow down, and when you want to accelerate, the response is so delayed.

The radio controls are ridiculous to figure out as well, if you are ever considering buying one, get out a peice of paper and check out all these things that i have said and after you find all these things true, go down to your local honda/toyota dealer and pick up a honda accord or a camry.

Overall, this sebring is the very example of why japanese cars are phenomenally better than poorly built american cars. also if younote under roominess, i really wanted to put down "built for people with no heads."

P.S. dont buy this car.
