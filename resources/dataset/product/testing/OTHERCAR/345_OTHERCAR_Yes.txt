            My husband and I were introduced to the Xterra when our friend bought one.  We both thought it was pretty cool looking, and when he told us what he paid for it, we liked it even more.  That was almost a year ago.  We purchased our own two months ago, and here's why:

First of all, we wanted a sport utility rather than a family van or station wagon.  We have an 8-month-old son who was getting rather heavy for me to be bending over getting him in and out of the car (1998 Chevy Malibu).  We didn't want to compromise functionality for sportiness, however.  We were lucky that our friend trusted us to drive his Xterra around town on a regular basis.  Test-driving it was easy.  

Second, we wanted something reasonably priced.  While SUVs are by no means cheap, this one is one of the least expensive in its class.  Comparable in price to that of a mini-van.

Third, we wanted lots of OPTIONS!  Our Malibu was pretty well loaded, so we wanted options comparable to those.  The Xterra comes equipped with CD player as standard, which was a major plus for the music lover in me!  Also, the Xterra comes standard with a full-size spare.  The other options weren't as expensive as I had imagined either, and as the commercial advertises...&quot;everything you want, nothing you don't&quot;.  The packages are grouped so that if you want one of the things, you will want ALL of the things in the package.  Included in one of the packages is an emergency kit...scoring points with the mom in me!

In addition, the exterior color choices were great!  We picked a color (denim blue) that isn't used on too many cars (we wanted to be able to identify ourselves in a parking lot!)

It was an added bonus that we got great service at our dealership and with the Nissan Corporation.  We have been contacted several times by both to make sure we are enjoying our vehicle.  

No wonder this vehicle was voted Motor Trend SUV of the Year!<br><br>
