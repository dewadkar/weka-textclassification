            I've got a '92 Geo Tracker and am quite pleased with it.  It may not be as versatile as my previous vehicle ('96 Mazda B4000LE pickup), but it is a whole lot more fun (and economical) to drive.  I thoroughly researched this vehicle before I bought it.  It still had it's original tires when I bought it in November '99 (it only had 42,000 miles on it!).  I put 4 Bridgestone Dueler H/L tires on it a month later, and have loved driving it ever since.  The Tracker loves to go 65-70 mph.  Not much stops it.  It developed some wind noise around the front of the top after I met a semi on a very windy Kansas day.  Either the bow is sprung or it's time to replace the bow gasket and/or weatherstripping.

I added an aftermarket console (gotta have a cupholder and CD storage) and I changed the factory radio (CD input jack on the front of the new radio). There are all kinds of aftermarket accessories available for this vehicle.
The previous owner installed a BesTop Replace-A-Top shortly before I bought it.

I'm 6'2&quot; and have plenty of room.  I test drove a '99 Toyota RAV before I got the Tracker and it didn't have near the legroom.  I've never felt like I was going tip over while driving.  The heater is very capable even on the coldest, windiest day.  I've got A/C, but haven't used it.

The Tracker may not be for everyone, but it suits me just fine.  

Would I buy another one?  In a heartbeat!  <br><br>
