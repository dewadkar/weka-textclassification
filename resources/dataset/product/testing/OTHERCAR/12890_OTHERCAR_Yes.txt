            Like everybody else I've been out car shopping since the 0% financing craze wetted my appetite.  This time we're looking to replace my old Mitsi Galant with a "family mobile" to carry baby and associated equipment.  (We're planning hopefully for the near future.)

In deciding what to get I face the challenge every married man faces, "What can I get my wife to drive that's not too pricey yet safe and practical."  Being unsucessful in stearing her towards the mini-van, she's just not ready for the image, I'm left with the station wagon vs. mini-SUV trade-off.  Already owning a 2000 Passat we know what wagon we would get, but decided to compare it against the latest generation of mini-SUVs.  

Right off the bat I must state that we don't even pretend to be "off-roaders" so I wasn't concerned with that portion of vehicle performance.  I'm really just looking for a station wagon with high visibility and 4WD to help in bad weather.

From all I've read the top 2 competitors this year in the mini-ute category are the Mazda Tribute (Cheaper with better warranty than it's Ford Escape clone) and the newly redesigned Honda CR-V.

I've driven the Tribute a couple times and find it a competent vehicle for this class.  Decent road performance from the V-6 with a fairly well thought out interior.

A couple weeks back we were at the Honda dealer looking at the Oddessy (hoping to rekindle an interest from my wife in mini-Vans) when I looked over and saw the new CR-V fresh off the truck.  We ran over and asked for a spin.  Overall we were very favorably impressed. Honda really worked to remove the "thin box" feel of the previous model.  Now there were 2 competitors on the block.

Based on our limited test drives and comparison of specs, here's my take on strengths of both:

Performance:  ADVANTAGE MAZDA  Yes the 160 HP, 4 cylinder IVTEC engine in the CR-V is adequate, but I'm used to the 4 cyclinder in the Passat with similar Horsepower but significantly higher performance.  Stomp on the gas and the Honda seems like it's working hard to find power, whereas the Tribute just moves.  (Honda claims the CR-V has better 0-60 times than the Mazda, but I'm just not believing it.)This performance difference is also translated into towing capacity where the CR-V's v4 is limited to 1500 lbs, whereas the V6 Tribute can tow 2500 lbs with the proper package.  I really can't recommend the V-4 version of the Tribute as it has only 140 HP, 20 less than the CR-V.  

Space:  ADVANTAGE HONDA  While both vehicles have the same amount of cargo space (33 cubic ft seat up/74 seat down), the HONDA is easier to use.  In the CRV you can fold down the back seat without removing the head rests, unlike the Tribute.  Clever interior design also gives the Honda 2 inches more head and leg room in the rear seat.  (Both are equal in the front seat.)

Price:  ADVANTAGE HONDA.  At a sticker price of $22.7K for a fully loaded EX model, the Honda is about $3K cheaper than the comparable V-6 Tribute.

Reliability:  ADVANTAGE HONDA  Although the monthly recalls of the Tribute have calmed down, there's no doubt that Honda's reputation will carry through on this vehicle as well.  Both seem like solid vehicles, but I'd bet on fewer trips to the dealer with the Honda, even if it doesn't have the length of warranty the Mazda carries.

Features:  TOSS-UP.  They both are very well equipped vehicles with all the standard creature comforts including 6-CD dash stereos, sunroofs, and power everything.  The CR-V does have one nice feature in express-up windows.  There are divided schools of thought on whether the traditional tailgate on the Tribute is better than the side-opening door on the CR-V.

Styling:  Personal Choice.  My wife prefers the "cute" styling of the CR-V with it's brushed metal HVAC controls and folding center counsel.  I'm a little more partial to the Tributes more "truck" looking dash and exterior styling.  Obviously a matter of personal opinion but I think our opinions probably reflect the respective target markets for both vehicles.

Final Analysis:  How much is 40 HP extra worth?  Not only is the Tribute about $3K more, it also has lower fuel economy, 18/24 vs. 22/26 for the CR-V.  If you can live with the difference in performance, the CR-V is your vehicle.  Either seems a credible choice as a "station wagon" substitute, but the Passat blows both of them away if you can give up the visibility of sitting high.

What did I choose?  We'll I'm still thinking it over.  With special financing not applying to either, I decided to wait out the winter and allow the market to cool down to help my negotiating position with the dealer.  I'm also waiting for a third horse in this race, the Saturn VUE, available in December.  Based on the limited specs and pricing data available on the web site, I'd say the VUE is a credible contender with V6, a full range of safety options, and comparable space. (Exterior dimensions vs. interior space make the VUE seem not as space efficient but I'll reserve judgement until I'm behind the wheel.)  The local Saturn dealer already had 60 customers place orders "sight unseen".  That's a little more faith than I have.

Come spring it's the final show-down with my wife giving the final "thumbs-up".  Stay tuned for the final voting.
