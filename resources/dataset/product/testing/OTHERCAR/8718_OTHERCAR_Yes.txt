            When this car was purchased in 1997, I did not expect it to last more than about 80,000 miles. My father and I do a lot of traveling, in fact, in the 3 years that it has been owned, 130,000 miles have been put on the car. It takes frequent trips of over 300 miles in a day. Prior to this car, we had 2 Nissan Maximas, which were excellent cars in their own rights. But this car can just take a beating and keep going. It has been through it all; rain, snow, mud, dirt, everything. With all this punishment, we knew it would be  a tough road (no pun intended) ahead for this car. But amazingly, the only problems we had, if you even consider them problems, is rough right front brake rotor (easily replaced), and new suspension bits (any car needs new suspension after many thousands of hard miles). Now at just a hair over 3 years and 130,000 miles, the engine runs as smooth as ever. Some say the Bonneville's engine is ancient technology, but it is simple and rock-solid enough to take 130,000 miles with no sweat. It is just that good. It is every bit as powerful as it was 3 years ago. The interior has aged quite well, also. The big comfy leather seats are still soft, with no holes, and the parts in the interior still hold together like new. The ride is smooth and the car has plenty of power. It does not feel quite as large as it is, but you still have to get used to its substantial build. Overall, no other car I have personally driven stands up to over 43,000 miles a year and keeps going strong as this one.

***Update 12/29/2000 - 145,000 miles****

In the 15,000 miles since the initial report, we had our first major problem. The car would seem to struggle to accelerate uphill, although everyday driving was unaffected. But then it got worse- it would struggle to accelerate under any circumstance. Soon enough, the car wouldn't move at all. It turned out to be the transmission, and the whole deal had to be replaced. But a few days and a few grand later, the car was back up to its unbeatable reputation. The throttle response is near-instantanious, and it accelerates smoothly and with power. The right rear strut is starting to squeak, but with the amount of miles on them, I think it is time for a four-point replacement. After that, the car will probably run STILL as if it were brand new.<br><br>
