            The Powershot G1 is my third digital camera. I've owned a Nikon and Sony.<br>
<br>
Battery and memory capacity were my two biggest factors in choosing this camera. Since the camera takes CF type II cards, you can use the IBM microdrive in the camera. Yes, a hard drive the size of a compact flash card! Many times cheaper than raw memory you'd find in smart media or sony's memory stick. I purchased the 1 gig CF card, and I can get something like 500+ images at the highest resolution. You can then plug the CF card into a PCMCIA adaptor on your laptop and copy the files as if it was another drive. The battery life is remarkably impressive, even with the Microdrive.<br>
<br>
The movie feature is pretty cool. Unlike the nikon coolpix, it records audio as well as video. Drawbacks with its movies are that it only is capable of recording 30 second clips, regardless of memory capacity. Then again, a good still camera may not be a good video camera... and vise versa. <br>
It'll store the images in either cannon's format, or JPG. Video images are stored as AVIs. 
<br>
The flip out LCD is great. Makes self portraits of you next to someone special easy. <br>
<br>
The camera is a bit bulky and heavy. Its a little harder to snowboard with. Its also not too quick in the <i>power on </i> initialization. But for the features it has, I was willing to deal with it.
