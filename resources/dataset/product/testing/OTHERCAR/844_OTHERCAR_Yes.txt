            My family owns a black/tan 1996 Nissan 300ZX Twin Turbo that I drive from time to time (Its primarily my husbands).  This car has a turbocharged V6 engine and can move like no other sports car I have ever driven.  It goes from 0 - 60 in 6.5 seconds and top speed is 155 mph.  We previously owned a 1999 Corvette and I strongly believe that the ZX drives better than the vette.  Handling is a dream and the leather seats are so comfortable.  The sound system is the est I've had in a car.  Its a Bose system, so that explains it.  My ZX has removable T-tops which are nice if you like hardtops or convertibles.  With the tops you get a little of both worlds.  Gas isn't too bad either, usually about 18/24 mpg.  The ZX is a wonderful car and I would strongly recommend looking into one of these sports cars.
