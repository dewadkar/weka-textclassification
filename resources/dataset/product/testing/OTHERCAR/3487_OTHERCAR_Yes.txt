            Profile/History
Prior vehicle was a 94 Volvo 940 (rear wheel drive) wagon 145K miles.  Wagon needed for outside sales & family hauling.  Car was purchased used w/ 30K miles from Mazda dealer for $17.8K.  I bought the car based on the give away price and the 160K trouble free miles my sister has experience w/ her Subaru.

6) Frameless windows: closing door w/ windows down feels and sound cheap.  
7) Door seals: wind noise would leak pass driver outside mirror.
8) Service expense: dealer service for recall was great, but routine service was costly.
9) Window speed: driver&#146s one touch open is too slow
10) Looks:  molded rocker & door panels are too plastic and overly Macho (and I am a Macho guy) 

Summary
Solid and dependable small haul vehicle, but if bought at sticker price way too expensive!
