            Recently I needed to buy a new truck.  I test drove all sorts of trucks before making my decision and now I am completely satisfied with my one ton Chevy dually.

This truck was built for towing.  Having horses and a large trailer I have had no difficulty with steep hills and gravel roads.  The engine, 350, 5.7 L., fuel injection has a lot of kick when needed and I have found the gas mileage to run around 14-16 on the highway. Pulling the trailer the gas mileage stays around 12 mpg.

I've had no mechanical problems of any kind with the truck . There are no rattles or noises yet and there have been no problems with the side view mirrors (which are notoriously bad for breaking on recent Chevy's).  The air conditioner and placement of vents allow for rear air and a variety of settings.  There are reading and map lights for each seat which do not interfere with night driving.

The ride is very quiet for such a large truck.  Although my truck was ordered with extra suspension in the rear and the ride is slightly stiffer than standard duallys, it is still comfortable.

The center console stows a lot of extra gear.  There is a built in garage door opener, sunglass case, wallet compartment, CD rack and clipboard.  The displays and gauges are easy to see and the stereo is well within reach.

I have had two back surgeries and comfort was a major consideration.  The seats are roomy, with lumbar supports and the drivers seats are completely automatic with push button controls.  The back seats, although also as roomy, lack these back supports and have hardly any reclining ability. There is storage behind the back seats, enough for a small tool box and some gear.  

Doors and windows and side mirrors are power and the keyless entry is great when your hands are full.  

This is one powerful, roomy and fun truck to drive.<br><br>
