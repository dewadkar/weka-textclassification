            I drive a 95 VW Jetta 3.  I've had this car since November of 1999.  Ever since then it's been a pretty good car for the purpose that I got it for, which is to carry me around comfortably, reliably, and safely.  During the time that I've had it, it's been able to take a lot of punishment that this teenager has dished out to it.  I've driven it into a curb after sliding on ice, I've bumped into my garage door with it (no damage to either), and I've often done some pretty hard accelerations.  There are three big things that I like about driving this car.  First, it gets some pretty sweet gas mileage.  Thirty miles per gallon in the city is quite common for me.  Some of my other friends who drive trucks have to fill their tanks every week and a half; i can go three weeks without a fill-up.  The second thing that is cool is the space inside it.  I can accommodate 5 people including myself in the car or fold down the back seat and have a ton of trunk space.  I can carry a bunch of golf bags or a few radio controlled model airplanes and all the supporting equipment inside.  The third thing that I like about the Jetta is how reliable it has been for me.  The only real maintenance issues I've had were a dead battery and a 60K mile timing belt that went out at 64K.  Other than those I can't think of any other problems I've had.  Hopefully this car will continue to run (so help it God) after I graduate from high school.  The way it looks right now, that seems a pretty good possibility.
