            I purchased the DImage 7 about a month and a half ago. I have actually never owned anything but a point and click, and a few throw away. I am by no means a photographer, but I have the need to take pictures for my side business in furniture making and restoration, as well as a personal desire to a camera. I tend to dive into things full force, and I do not like to buy a cheap piece of junk since I'll grow out of it in a very short time.

Originally, I was looking at the Cannon D30, but found the price tag a bit high for practicality. The store pointed me towards the DImage 7, and told me I was nuts if was going for the Cannon with my experience and uses for the camera. In a short time I agreed, and had one a day or two later.

I should note, my FIRST camera arrived, and I found within a week that there was a power supply problem. It shutdown even when plugged in, or with fresh batteries. The store swapped it without any problem and said that was a definite problem.

Once I had a working device, I set out to experiment. It took me three or four weeks of tinkering to really get the hang of it. There are a lot of features and controls, but as you gain an understanding of photography, in general they start to make sense. Took me a week or so to be able to quickly change settings and such being new to photography, but the controls seemed ergonomic enough.

Menus are easy to navigate, and the controls work nicely. Zoom is a bit ruff, but functions well. Digital zoom is quite handy at times.

The camera does not adjust well to an external flash in automatic mode, I found it must be operated fully manual to be of any use with the extra flash. The built in flash is handled quite well. I should also note that it amazed me with low light capability. I have taken pictures I never thought would come out in a darkened room and found them to be very nice.

The wide angle and macro lens options are great, I've managed to take some nice shots with them so far without even beginning to find their capabilities. I have a whole set of filters, no clue what they do as of yet!?

The only major cons to this camera I found so far is battery life and the power connection:

I found that alkaline batteries are just a waste; don't even bother to put them in the camera unless you like wasting $4 in 15 minutes. Go right for the NiMH batteries, highest capacity you can find and buy a quick charger. I now have eight sets to keep this beast's hunger for power fed. I find that I can take about 50-100 pictures depending on the quality and time between shots with the battery life. Less time, you run the view screen the better.

As for the power connection, it's a simple plug in - no ability to hold in. A power pack for this camera would be useless unless it was on a tripod. The connector falls out easily, so anything on a backpack battery or belt battery pack would just keep falling out on you. That's a shame; I really wanted to go with a power pack on this camera as soon as possible.

Overall, I'm very happy, just wish I could connect a power pack. I see years of fun and great pictures before I outgrow this camera.
