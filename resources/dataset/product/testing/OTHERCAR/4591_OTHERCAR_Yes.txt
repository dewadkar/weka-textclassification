              There is a story behind every purchase out there so here goes mine. I have an old GMC safari that is too old and to worn for long trips any longer. I have three kids and another on the way. With those considerations at hand my wife and I decided to explore the used and new market for van/minivans. 
  We looked at everything out there just about three months and came very close to buying a used Pontiac Montana. However after looking at the miles and the enormous depreciation after the purchase it was apparent that a new van was going to be our choice. 
  The first thing I noticed about the Toyota was its inside. Its not as spacious as Astro/Safari/Eurovan but it's it close enough. It does not offer the camping out format of the Eurovan and does not feel like a truck. The controls of the dash are well laid out and very easy to use. In about fifteen minutes or less a seasoned driver is capable of figuring out to switches and controls. Its more upscale then any other minivan out there. I think only Chrysler may out do the Toyota in the arena. What the others do not offer is the seating flexibility that this van has. I choose the eight seat configuration. It is well laid out and thought of system, better then the GM system that I am sure it was copied from. The 60/40 split rear seats work well, and take a few minutes learn. (Video instruction included on seats). 
  The ride is very comfortable and quiet. I think the roof rack creates some wind noise above 70mph. 
  Engine, is good, not as strong as domestic products in the low end. Transmission is transparent unless pushed. I drove this van to 90 without any effort. It is governed at 109mph. Gas mileage is great for a vehicle this size. I am getting 22.3mpg currently with a mix of city and highway. (comes with a trip computer) Its another reason why I opted for the Toyota. The Kia was a real consideration, the gas mileage sucked so it lost in that comparison.
  Price. I paid 900 less retail and 1300$ over invoice. Lots of options with this van. Be careful and choose options that you feel necessary for your comfort and those around you. 
Resale should be equal to that of Honda. Used Honda's are outrageous as we all know.
