            My reasons for purchasing the camera were simple.  My wife, an art teacher, wanted a digital camera to record her students work.  I just wanted one because I like toys. Plus, I had an income tax return burning a hole in my pocket.

So I started to research digital cameras.  The Olympus 340r seemed to be just what I was looking for. It had decent resolution, good battery life, and a price tag that would allow the purchase of an Smart Card before my tax return was gone.  Not to mention the fact that it was available in my local market for that instant gratification, I so long for.

So, I ended up with a digital camera that takes a great picture when you crank it all the way up to its 1.3 mega pixel setting.  The detail is good and the colors are rich.  In fact, I have some lovely pictures of my wife's art work which adorn my computer.

The download time from the camera isn't too excruciating, and the inclusion of rechargeable batteries and charger was a nice bonus.

Now for the but.....

The digital zoom has only one setting and only works in the lowest resolution.

The buttons on the camera are not fat finger friendly.

The sliding lens cover is already broken.  The mechanism that supplies the tension to keep the cover closed and open, seems to have relaxed.  UPDATE: The fixed it quickly, promptly and even though they could of contested the warranty (I called on the last day) they still paid for it.  This is a great company to deal with.

All in all for the price this a nice entry level camera.  Although an optical zoom would have been nice, I can always move closer.  As far as the lens cover, just be careful.
