            Dodge has finally found its way into my heart.  In 1997 I owned a Dodge Ram but I was less than thrilled with it.  Recently I have been car shopping and I've come across the Dodge Avenger.  The Avenger comes in two models, the Sports Coupe and the ES.  The ES is the more expensive of the two but it's well worth it as it is equipped with more options.  Nonetheless, both models are pure excitement to drive.
From the moment you pull out of the dealers lot you feel an immediate rush of adrenaline.  The car handles itself very nicely around corners, short stops, and for when you're looking for that extra boost of speed.  Overall, the cars engine is also incredibly equipped with a V-6 option which leaves nothing to be desired.
The sporty exterior is also incredibly flashy and catchy to one's eye.  It is also available in a multitude of colors that range across the spectrum. The interior is also very catchy to the driver as well.  The ES model comes with the leather interior option while both models have the moonroof and rear spoiler option.
The bottom line is that if you're in the market for a luxury yet sporty car then take a look at the Dodge Avenger.<br><br>
