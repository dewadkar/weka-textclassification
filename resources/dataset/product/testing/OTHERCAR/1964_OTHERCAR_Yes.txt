            I purchased a Sterling Mist automatic 2000 SE in April. It has the Comfort and Convenience Package, 17&quot; aluminum-alloy wheels, P225/50VR17 Bridgestone Potenza tires, leather, and Bose stereo with rear woofer. 

It has become my all-time favorite car. Other reviewers have complained about the stereo but mine sounds splendid to my ears and I have long been an audio-purist. With liberal use of the bass control, the deck-mounted woofer has all the &quot;woof&quot; I need. 

The SE is a true kick to drive with its superb V-6 and smooth automatic. 
This car exudes confidence and stability when cornering and shows no sign of mushiness when braking. The sport-suspension is forgiving of all but the worst road imperfections. Gas mileage is commendable when you consider the car's outstanding performance. I average 20-21 mpg in mixed city/expressway driving and 27 mpg on the only interstate-only trip I have made at average speeds of 70 mph. I did not check the mileage until after the break-in period.

Before my purchase, I also drove the GLE to compare its softer suspension (better ride, maybe?) but the SE's &quot;fun factor&quot; and better cornering stability won me over. Not to mention those ultra-cool Titanium-tinted gauges and the eye-catching spoiler that the GLE look &quot;unfinished.&quot;

The view from the driver's seat is excellent with unobstructed vision front and rear, a real safety feature for me when changing lanes and merging. I'm not sure one would be able to see the rear deck when backing a Maxima that does not have a spoiler (GXE and GLE). 

The 8-way adjustable driver's seat is great, the first I have ever felt truly comfortable in. I think the car is particularly well-suited to shorter folks. The folding-rear seat masks a much-appreciated and generous-sized opening to the trunk, something I sorely missed on two previous cars I owned, a 1990 Acura Legend and a 1994 Lexus ES300. Cup-holders and power-outlets both front and rear are a nice touch, as is the adjustable-height console lid.

Another reviewer complained of its height, called it SUV-like (although he had the GLE with 16&quot; wheels, which should be lower) but I love the additional ground-clearance as it makes entrance/exit much easier, and I no longer worry about scraping the front and/or rear of the car when negotiating &quot;problem&quot; driveways.

The fit-and-finish of my Maxima is second to none, both inside and out, and obviously reflects Nissan's excellent quality control. I have found no defects of any kind. 

Lest you think my Maxima is perfect, it is not. I think the bumpers need additional protection of some kind to prevent inevitable parking lot scratches. I wish it had audio controls on the steering wheel. I wish it had an electro-chromatic mirror. I wish it used regular fuel instead of the required premium. It will run, but with reduced performance. Also, the base-model GXE, although well-equipped and priced, requires the purchase of the Comfort and Convenience Package just to get variable-speed windshield wipers. That package costs $1,069, and in turn requires an automatic transmission for $1700, for a total increase in cost of $2,769 over the GXE's MSRP of $21049. Nissan should hang its head over that one. Variable-speed wipers should be standard on all their models just as it is for most other makes.   

At a well-negotiated price, the Maxima SE is superior to competition that often goes for sticker and near-sticker prices, and it is far more unique-looking than the Accord and Camry, even the Acura TL. I recommend it to anyone who wants a sedan that is more than just pedestrian transportation.<br><br>
