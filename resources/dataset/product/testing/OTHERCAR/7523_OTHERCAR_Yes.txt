            I would never have bought this car, preferring cars like the Mitsubishi Eclipse (See my review), but my mother did buy it, and not long after, because of age and other factors, decided she no longer wanted to drive.  At any rate, I picked up the payments on an extremely low mileage (2000) two year old (1996 model)car.

It handles well enough for a four door sedan.  I must admit that it is more comfortable on a long drive than my Eclipse had been.  I have done almost nothing other than change the oil, and going on 30,000 miles, I have had no problems whatever with it.

The air conditioner does not cool as fast as I would like, but I do live in Dallas, so it is hard to get too upset about that.

I like the fact that the back seat folds down - this allows carrying 8' 2*4's with little problem.

It has a 4 cylinder engine, but the acceleration is more than adequate.  It gets around 23 mpg, with most of my driving being stop and go - is there any other kind in Dallas?
