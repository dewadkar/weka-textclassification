            This is an amazing camera.  It makes the S110 Elph seem large!  I bought the Dimage X to replace my Elph.

This cam has very long battery life and a 3X optical zoom.  But, the zooming is all done inside the camera!  Amazing.  Image quality is quite good.  It is possible that the Elph has slightly better quality in some situations, but this is splitting hairs.  The Dimage X is a camera you can always have with you so you never have to miss a photo opportunity.

Uses postage stamp size Secure Digital memory.  I bought a 128M SD card.

Movie mode and audio annotation to images is also nice.  Lots of JPEG modes, and there's even an uncompressed TIFF mode.

Menus are very easy to navigate.  Easier than my S110 Elph.

My opinion is that Minolta has done some groundbreaking innovation here.  The digital camera comsumer field will never be the same!  Minolta has set a new standard in this market segment.

I bought the Dimage X for $371. from www.ritzcamera.com including shipping and no sales tax.  (They price matched another vendor plus the vendor's shipping.)

I recommend this wholeheartedly!  Even if you are a photo enthusiast, I think you'll love the Dimage X as a second camera.  I look forward to what Minolta will release next year to improve on the Dimage X.  In my opinion, this one's a real winner!
