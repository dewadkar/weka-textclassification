            Ok, I am a girl through and through, you know the type, I hate to get dirty.  But for some reason I felt that we needed a larger vehicle to move cross country.  

So we shopped and shopped for Jeeps, but they just didn't fit us, I am sure it is partly because of my dislike of American cars.  So for some unknown reason we stopped into a Nissan dealer and test drove a pathfinder and ended up going home with it.  I can definitely tell you that my husband and I are not the spur of the moment type, so this is a huge feat for us.  So much for shopping around.  

We have since traded it in for a Nissan Maxima, but it was a great truck.  It towed my Honda Civic cross country from Maine to California, and didn't complain one bit (can't say as much for the hubby).  The seats were so comfortable my cats didn't even mind being stuck for 10 days.  It was very peppy and looks great too.  The controls seem to be just where you would want them, and the base stereo was great.  One more thing about the seats was the cloth; they are woven cloth, and were very easy to keep clean.  Ours was a standard and I had no trouble in shifting (though I have no idea how to use the 4WD).

Maybe someday if we are back in the market for a SUV, we will buy another...For now, we are much more suited for a sedan since we do so much driving and sitting in traffic, and not much hauling or towing.<br><br>
