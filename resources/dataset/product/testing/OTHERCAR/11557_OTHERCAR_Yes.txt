            I bought this vehicle for my daughter shortly after her sixteenth birthday.  She attends school out of town and I wanted a vehicle that would get her there, safely, in all kinds of weather.  She has become stuck in deep mud conditions and got out by simply shifting into four wheel drive - no problem.  We recently had an evening of freezing rain, again, her jeep had no problems performing as expected.  Can't think of one complaint.  Smooth ride, comfortable seating.  <br><br>
