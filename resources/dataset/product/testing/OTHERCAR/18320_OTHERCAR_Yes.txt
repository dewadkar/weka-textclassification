                 Life began with my '95 GS-T in August of 1995.
     A couple of years earlier I had bought a GT automatic and it had been a pretty good car.  The new body style came out in 1995 and I thought it was gorgeous.   One day I went into the dealership to more closely inspect the new body and discovered that all of the shortcomings that I had with my '93 GT had been cured with the new body style.
     On the dealership floor there was a GS-T in Durango Copper which is kind of a burnt orange color.  I thought the color perfectly set off the lines of the new body style.
     The salesman asked if I wanted to drive one and I said yes so we went out in a GSX 5-speed which is the turbo four-wheel drive version.  Well, I didn't really car for it because the thing had such good traction that you couldn't spin the wheels or slide it even if you wanted to.  I told him it didn't turn me on and was kind of boring to drive.  He said all right try this one and he put me into a 5-speed turbo GS-T which has front wheel drive.  What a difference!  This car, which is about 400 lbs. lighter than a GSX, would light up the front wheels(burn rubber) at will.  Getting on an expressway was like riding a rocket ship and boy was it fun!  I came back from the test drive and decided I had to have one.
     I told the salesman that I wanted a GS-T in Durango Copper with 5-speed, leather interior, and a moon roof that was factory installed and I wouldn't pay over $350 over invoice for it.  The didn't have one like that at the dealership but said they could get one if I put up a $500 deposit.  I gave them a deposit and a week later they called and said they had the car in.
     The dealership carried through on all their promises with no hidden fees or new charges and I drove the car home.
     I have now had the car 5 years and it has 60,000 miles on it.  Am I happy with it?  YOU BET!!!!
     Not one single thing about the car has disappointed me, in fact I like the car now more than I did when it was new.
     This car is so pretty that it brings a smile to my face every time I get into it.  I have had more compliments and comments on this car than any other car I've ever owned and I've owned Porsches, Mercedes and a whole bunch of sports cars.
     The only things that I have had to do to the car since I bought it is put gas in it, change the oil and put one set of tires on it.  Nothing has ever broke on it or failed and the paint is still beautiful.
     The worst mileage the car has ever gotten is 22 mpg and the best is 31 mpg.  I average about 24 mpg.
     The thing corners like it is on rails and has fantastic acceleration.  I have gotten into several impromptu road races with BMW M's, Porsches, and a few other hot sports cars and there is nothing that can outrun it on a curvy road!
     One of the things I like so much about the car is that if you are going 75-80 and some eighteen wheeler is tailgateing you that all you have to do is press your right foot down and you leave him like he was standing still and you're out of sight of him within a minute or two.  There is nothing dangerous about this because this car HANDLES at high speed!
     In summary I ask the question &quot;What is there not to like about this car?&quot;  The answer is nothing!  It is reliable, gets great gas mileage, goes like stink, handles great in any situation and is gorgeous.<br><br>
