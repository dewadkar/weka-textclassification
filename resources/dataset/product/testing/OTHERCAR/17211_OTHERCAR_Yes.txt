            I bought my Honda Civic 5 years ago. After shopping for various vehicles I found that it was the most economic.  I had a Honda Accord before and had put over 90,000 miles on it and not had a bit of trouble.  I am in outside sales and have put about 80,000 on my car and again have not had any major repairs.  I love my Honda's because they are dependable.  I even went off road with it and up a mountain where only a four wheel should go and my Honda was great and never over heated.  They are fun and easy to drive.  Small but large enough for comfort.  I feel this vehicle is for anyone. My next car will be Honda...I would not buy anything else. <br><br>
