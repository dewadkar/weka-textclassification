            I bought my Ricoh 2 years ago this month.  A friend wanted me to figure hers out and explain to her.  I liked it so much I bought one.  It was the only camera at the time that followed my 1 1/2 year old.  Most digital cameras were hard to use for me due to the active child always moving.  They didn't seem to keep up with the movement of my child.  I go everywhere with my Ricoh camera.  It's small enough to fit in my bag or glove box and easy to follow software is great.  I use it in my jewelry business.  With the macro lens and a tripod I am able to get a nice clean shot of custom pieces to send with an appraisal, also it is great for advertising.  This camera has also been useful for my valuable household items.  I have kept a record of household items along with pics I have taken with my RDC-300<br><br>
