               Let me start by saying, the 3000GT is one of the most awesome cars ever produced, period. A common theme to some of the other statements about the 3000GT, seem to be &quot;to much money. not enough power&quot;, of that I will say, true of the SL, not of the VR-4. Keep in mind, the 3000GT was intended as a touring car, not a pure sports car. (think about how much a Mercedes-Benz is and how slow it goes). The 320 HP, six-speed, all-wheel drive VR-4 is a very capable machine. 320 HP not enough for you? A simple $400 boost control modification will up the stock pressure from 11 PSI to 14 PSI, which can be run on pump gas. This will add about 50 more ponies to the car, and will still maintain everyday drivability.

   The 3000 GT has had it's fair share of mechanical issues, namely the German-built Getrag transmission. However the majority of these issuse were with the early 3000GT models, prior to 1994. The first generation 3000's offered a 300 HP, 2-bolt main, mated to 5-speed Getrag tranny. The second generation moved to a 320 HP 4-bolt main coupled to a 6-speed Getrag. To be clear, Mitsubishi only issued a recall on the transfer case, not the tranny. This due to leaking seals. The one other recall was on the 1991-1992 3000's for the front brake lines.

   Mitsubishi saved the best VR-4 for last, the 1999 model is truly awesome to look at and drive. It's a shame that Mitsubishi chose to discontinue prodution of the 3000GT, it was just getting better with time. I will say that I was somewhat dissapointed when the four-wheel steering system was dropped from the car in 1996, in that same year the speed sensitive &quot;Active Aero&quot; was also dropped. The Active Aero engaged at around 45 MPH and added an extra 100 lbs. of downforce to the car at 65 MPH. The ECS, or electronic controlled suspention, and the Sport/Tour exhaust were also recently phased out of the model line. Some would say these are mearly gadgets. All are fully functional, the all-wheel drive system with the standard anti-lock brakes, make wet weather driving a much easier task. 


   Ok in a nutshell the 1999 VR-4 will set you back some serious change, and the SL/base models exibit lack-luster performance. But if you want a unique car with one of a kind styling and superior performance get the 1999 VR-4. By the way, good luck finding one there were less than 2000 units in the VR-4 trim sold in the US for the '99 model year.
