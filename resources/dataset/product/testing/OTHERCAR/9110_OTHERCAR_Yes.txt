                This review is for the EX version with cloth seats.  Let me start off by saying that this is my second KIA. My first (that I still own) is a 2000 Kia Sportage and that thing has been a true indestructible runner. Not nearly as smooth and stylish as my new van but a car I could always count on.  I went to the KIA dealer in Laurel Maryland and they were not your typical pushy dealer. When I mentioned I was looking they respected that and did not try to sell me anything or sway my opinion from other makes of auto. Well enough about them, lets review the van. 

    THE RIDE: I went in expecting that this van would not ride like the big guns of the mini-van world.  I was wrong. In fact they had a slightly used Caravan that I drove and could not tell the difference.  I read the pro reviews that state it lacks power.  Guys this is a Mini-Van, it has plenty of passing power.  I was getting around traffic better than I could with my 95 Contour. It is not quite as quiet as the rental Ford Windstar I once drove, but nothing else I have driven has been.  The seats are very plush and I'm not just talking about the front seats. The back middle and back seats are just as good as the drivers seat. It just snowed this week and I loved the way it stuck to the ground without slipping (a problem my Sportage could not get away from). Braking is a bit slow and soft unless you stomp on it and then you of course stop real quickly. I would have to say the only ride flaw is the brakes but it is minimal. Oh and I forgot to mention the fuel economy of around 22 on the highway and 18 in the city. Its a little higher than they rate the vehicle but thats what I got.
    
    STYLE:  I love the way this van looks. In fact it was the biggest reason to get me into the KIA dealer. Inside and out, this is the coolest looking van to date.  It has a leather wrapped steering wheel and a beautiful fake wood trimmed dash. 

    STEREO:  This system needs no upgrade.  It has the bass that my Sportage lacked with way more clarity.  Tweeters mounted in the front dash, main speakers in the front doors and near the back. I am a stereo junky and own $800 JBL speakers in my home so I know what makes a mean stereo.

   Well in closing, if you are out to buy a van and have not tried a KIA.  You may regret it (Like my neighbor) if you pass them up without a look.  They have become a much more respectable company since I bought my first one.  Remember, early Toyota's were junk when they first came to this country.
