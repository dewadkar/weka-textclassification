            Ok so you'd like a Sport Ute. that doesn't have the truckiness associated with the typical 4x4.  You may want to keep looking. The V70 XC is a far cry from a real on/off road vehicle, but as most industry people know very few owners will ever go off road with this vehicle.

In the summer of 1997 I was invited to a new product expo for the Volvo dealers and their support staff.  This was a good way to compare what Volvo was offering.  Getting my feet wet with this experimental marketing venue was wonderful.  The day after returning from this event I called my local Audi dealer and purchased new Quattro from them.  You may have guessed that we compared the Volvo to the Audi.
  
Some background on what Volvo has to offer here.  They have taken a two wheel drive platform and moved things around a bit plus borrowed a modified rear axle set up from the 900 series and stuffed it into a car that even as a two wheel drive platform has many shortcomings. Two short comings for this arrangement are limited suspension travel and tire and wheel size. 

As a technician, Volvo Certified, with many hours of diagnostics, I'd like to point to some facts.


1.  Tire life expectancy with normal driving is between 25,000 to 30,000 miles and in the event that one tire is damaged beyond repair and the other tires remain in usable condition it is imperative that all four tires be replaced.  If one tire has more tread than the remaining three the circumferential difference can be enough to damage the angle gear and the viscous coupler.

2.  Oil leaks are fairly common, especially the rear main seals. If you are out of warranty typical 10 hours 2wd, add 1 hr AWD parts cost minimal.

3.  Check engine lights many of which have been the fault of leaking seam/plastic weld on the fuel tank, or in some cases a fuel system leak code is logged but the source of the code may actually be a result of faults in the climate control system. 
 
4. Rear brake pad wear typically around 20,000 out of a set of rear pads.

5. Fuel efficiency typical Highway MPG 24 in town 15-18 (you can get the Explorer to do this)

6. Easily broken oil pan/radiator/intercooler this is typically from those few people who have gone off road or parked on a curb.

7. Very high failure rate of power window switches.
 
8. Door latch/motor assemblies. (almost every 98 or newer S,V,C, 70 has had at least one changed and many several times for the same uncorrected failures.

9. Engine Management Software glitches that require reprogramming of cars for certain uncharacteristic running complaints.

10.  A large number of these cars came back for vibrations and some very many times and most were due to drive line imbalances, which would also include tire problems. (see <a href='/auto-review-1A3A-DDE0CB6-39E0E56A-prod5'>http://www.epinions.com/auto-review-1A3A-DDE0CB6-39E0E56A-prod5</a>)

11. Cloth upholstery in certain XC models would stain from just water and they would not come clean and we would have to reupholster the entire seating area of the car at the customers expense.

12. Interior Door panels that have delaminated and bubbled.
 
13. Headlamp bulbs (us techs called them flashbulbs) always going.

14. Upper engine bushings (higher mileage cars and all 850/850 turbo cars.

15. Wiper motors but we suspect that the length of the wiper blade and depth of the snow may have contributed to the early expiration of some of these.

16. Many transmission replacements because of the harsher use of the 2wd transmission being adapted to use as a four wheel drive unit, and the forward thinking people at Volvo marketing not wanting to publish transmission service intervals.  (They do this so the industry statistics will show a lower frequency/cost of upkeep.}  The 2000 model XC has a inclusion for transmission service at 52,500 miles but for good measure it is best performed at 35k.
Please understand that there are many people who are experiencing warm fuzzy feelings about their Volvo XC and I hope that they will continue to but if you are considering this car as a used car think again.

I would actually recommend the 1999 or 2000 model XC with a set of Michelin tires, over the 2001 XC.  The 1999 model year brought some driveline refinement as well as a more dependable fuel system, longer life brake pads and light bulbs that were under warranty for 50,000 miles, which means that even though they still fail often the consumer does not have to buy them.

If it is too late and you own a 1998 XC or AWD already go to <a href='/auto-review-2E87-1ABBA800-39CAAF9D-prod6'>http://www.epinions.com/auto-review-2E87-1ABBA800-39CAAF9D-prod6</a> <br><br>
