            I have owned GM products all my adult life, but never have I been so taken with a vehicle that I bought it the first year it was introduced. Yes, I owned a 1998 Intrigue also. And never have I bought the same car twice in a row. Currently I own a 2000 Intrigue. 

This car has the feel of luxury with the handling of a sports car. The ABS and Traction control are a Godsend on Ohio roads in winter, and with the automatic lights, you never have to worry about leaving the lights on in your car. It has all the amenities and handles very well. 

Also, my husband and sons are large men and they fit in this car very comfortably. The leather interior classes it up even more, and the optional Bose 8 speaker sound system is a dream come true. I drive only 30 minutes to work each way, but my CD's sound so good on this stereo that sometimes it's hard to turn off the car and go to work! 

If you want the car to do the work for you in driving, this is the car for you. It's a good family car or a car for the young professional because it has good looks also. I think when my lease is up I'll probably buy another Intrigue!<br><br>
