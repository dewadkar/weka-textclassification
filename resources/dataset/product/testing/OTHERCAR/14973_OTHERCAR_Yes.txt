            My mother just bought this digital camera and since she has no clue about how set up anything electronic she gave it to me to figure out and then explain to her. I musr say I'm not the most knowledgable person when it comes to anything with computers or cameras, but I gave it a shot, and it was simple. In less than three minutes I was taking pictures and putting them on email. A lot of it had to do with the floppy disk. I am able to figure that out very quickly. I'm still working on the options the camera has to offer, but for someone who is pretty much useless to electronics, I think I did fairly well. The price tag is pretty steep, but I guess that's what you get when you want something that is easy and simple to use. I'm not crazy about the chunky size and design of the camera, but I can live with that. I have already considered buying one for myself. Very highly recommended if you are not to sure of your ability to use a digital camera. <br><br>
