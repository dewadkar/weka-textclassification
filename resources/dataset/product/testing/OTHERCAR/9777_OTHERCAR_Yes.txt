            I bought mine used in 1996. I've had one break-down last year from a blown radiator hose, and a dead battery that turned out to be an incorrect replacement battery.

Several unusual things you will either love or hate: a little more road-noise and road-feel than other luxury cars on rough roads, very heavy & expensive to maintain UFO front brakes (good for very high speed stops), a transmission that is anemic on economy setting and too aggressive on sport mode, and a factory sound system that is great, though the radio breaks periodically and must be exchanged at the dealership for just under $200 (once every 5 years), a peaky engine with lots of power at high rpms, 11 quart oil capacity - expensive to change oil, but oil hardly breaks down in normal driving...

Things to like: very comfortable interior front and back (mine has the sport seats - highly recommended), great sound system, full-time 4-wheel drive, high speed stability, good mileage for a v-8 (mine got about 26 on the highway, 15 in the city), built in rear sun-shade, trunk pass-through with ski-bag.

Things to dislike: maintenance is important and expensive, esp. front brakes and timing belt, front tires wear out quickly, heater/defroster does not defrost well enough.
