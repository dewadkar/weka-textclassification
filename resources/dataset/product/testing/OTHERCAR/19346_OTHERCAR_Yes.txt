            We decided that our 1991 Toyota Cressida, while still in good condition, had to retire itself, so we went out to look for a new car.  We ended up looking at several different cars.  Our choices were the Acura 3.2 TL, Lexus ES300, Infiniti I30, and the Toyota Avalon (just because the Avalon was the successor to the Cressida, and we owned two Toyota's previously).  They were all cars that were pretty similar to each other, and somewhere within the same price range.

We first looked at the Acura 3.2 TL, which according to magazines, was a great car for under $30K.  Thus, we stopped at our local Acura dealer (and ONLY Acura dealer) in Hawaii.  For some reason, they added an adjusted market price to their cars, which increased the TL to $34K.  This was basically a rip off, because the dealer said that we would be working between the MSRP (which was $29K) and $34K.  To top it off, my dad wasn't exactly interested in the Acura, because it was too "sporty".  Thus, the Acura was scratched off our list.  To tell you the truth, it is a good car, but not for what price they were offering.  

The Lexus ES300 was next in line.  The dealer was selling the ES for a little over $33K.  For what a Lexus is, I can't see why this car would cost this much.  The interior is really plain, and there's nothing special about the car.  The design has been used over and over again, for many years.  They hardly changed the design in any way.  In fact, the changes were really really subtle.  In a way, that made the design of the car rather boring.  All in all, it just wasn't worth the $33K.

The Avalon was actually a pretty decent car.  I didn't expect it to be so quiet and smooth.  But I guess you can assume it to be good, considering it's Toyota's top of the line, and it also has the EXACT same engine from the Lexus ES300.  The only gripe I had was the that car was too big, and it was also kinda ugly.  The rear end of the car was probably the worst design ever.  The front of the car was actually pretty decent, but the back just killed the design.  The interior was even more plain than the Lexus, so we just didn't feel that this car was for us.  They were offering the car for $27K with leather, but it really wasn't worth that much.

We finally decided on the Infiniti I30.  We got it for $28,800, which was actually a good deal compared to the other cars.  This car has it all.  I mean, talk about having virtually EVERYTHING standard.  I think the only thing we could get was a spoiler and the navagation system, in which we weren't interested in either.  My dad didn't really want the I30t, because we didn't want to pay the extra $3-4K for the 17" rims, HID headlamps, and their Viscous Limited-Slip Differential system.  Also, my dad wasn't into the "sporty" kind of cars.  The I30t also had stiffer springs, for a more sporty handling, which sacrificed comfort.  This wasn't the best trade-off for us.  Thus, we ended with the regular I30, and it was a good choice.  We got the car in  Titanium Metallic Silver, with black leather interior.  Let's talk about this car.

Performance:
This car is equipped with a 227hp V6 engine, and regarded by Ward Auto as one of the best V6 engines available.  I can see why.  This car has amazing passing power, which is useful especially on the highway.  Not only is the engine powerful, but it is incredibly quiet.  You can barely hear the engine as you drive.  The gears also change so smoothly, that you can't even feel it change.  The automatic transmission is just silky smooth.

Comfort:
The leather seats are extremely comfortable.  Since the car is also very very quiet, it makes the car even more comfortable.  The suspension is remarkable good, in which bumps are hardly felt.  The tires that come with the standard 16" rims are great, in that it hardly makes any tire noise while driving on the road.  You can also hardly hear any wind noise, probably because the car is more aerodynamic.

Interior:
There is much to say here.  First of all, the car comes with a 7-speaker Bose system.  This includes four speakers, 2 tweeters in the front, and a subwoofer in the back.  The sound is tremendous.  The Bose system also plays both CDs and tapes, so it'll satisfy both types of media.  Everything is also power in the car, from the windows to the driver and passenger seats.  There is also a memory seat feature for the driver seat, which memorizes up to 2 positions.  Pretty cool if you ask me.  Another thing standard is their sunroof, which has two functions: tilt or slide.  The rear window comes with a cool rear sunshade, which is really handy when parking in the sun.  There is also wood trim (fake wood, but good enough), which makes the car look a little more elegant.  The windows are also all tinted, which keeps UV light out.  We also liked the Homelink feature, which is a garage door opener inside your car.  This is so we didn't have to carry our garage door remote into the car.  There are also 5 cupholders in this car...yes 5.  The rear-view mirror also has a dimming feature, which dims when light shines upon it.  It even works at night when headlights shine through.  The rear-view mirror also has a compass, which is a neat feature.  What this car had which the other cars didn't was 60/40 split folding rear seats.  This allows more to be passed through the trunk into the car.  The other cars had a hole where the armrest is, which allows only things like golf clubs to pass through.  The air condition also has a filter, that filters out pollen and other junk from as small as 0.003mm.  Hawaii has relatively clean air, but this is good to know that it's still filtering.  

Safety:
This car has 4 airbags, and a head restraint system, that prevents people from getting whiplash.  It also comes with a factory installed alarm, so you don't have to go out and buy one.  The keys of the car also has a chip inside.  This chip is needed inside the key in order for the car to start.  If you just took the key to a key shop to get it cut, the newly cut key won't work because it doesn't have the chip.  This prevents people from stealing the car.

To top if off, the warranty on this car is outstanding.  Check it out:

A 4-year / 60,000-mile Basic New Vehicle Limited Warranty.
A 6-year / 70,000-mile Limited Powertrain Warranty.
A 7-year / Unlimited-Mileage Corrosion Limited Warranty.
And 24-Hour Emergency Roadside Service

All in all, this car is worth every penny.  I love it.  Not only does it look nice, but it comes with EVERYTHING.  The features are endless.  At first, we weren't even considering an Infiniti, but now this car has really showed us that an Infiniti is a great car.  Take it for a test drive, and you'll know what I mean.  This car is everything and more.  For an entry-level luxury car, this car wins hands down for it's price.
