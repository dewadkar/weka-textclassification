                 After several American makes bit the dust way too early (and an expensive way down as well), I bought my first foreign car, a Honda Accord.  It drives smoothly and is super quiet.  It has remained rattle-free.  The Honda service is quick and efficient and the car is supposed to go 100,000 miles without a tune up.  The air conditioner and heating are super, working quickly and efficiently.  It gets as cool as I want in the summer which is great!  The six way power seat with lumbar support is very comfortable for me to drive as I am short.  My husband, however, who is tall with long legs is not as comfortable because his arms have to be held straight out to reach the wheel when the seat is back far enough for his legs to stretch out.  It steers easily and smoothly and has nice pickup when needed.  This is the only drawback by either of us.  The car rates a 10 in our opinion!  <br><br>
