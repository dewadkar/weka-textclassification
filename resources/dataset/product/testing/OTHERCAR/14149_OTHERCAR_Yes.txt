            I have had this camera about a month now, and let me say I love it!!
I have been in the market for a digital camera for almost a year, and I could not afford the high dollar alternatives. This fit the bill for me.

First off, it comes with some nice stuff. It includes an 8 MB smart media card, USB connectors, pretty good photo software, and batteries. It fits in the palm of your hand, features a pretty good LCD screen to preview your photos (or to review the ones you've taken). Operation is intuitive, and fairly simple, and picture quality is good. You can fine tune the quality by changing the compression ratio of the photos--a basic setting will allow you to take 47 photos on the 8 MB smart card, fine will allow you to take 12. (I recommend getting additional smart media cards!!)

There are the usual widgets and gizmos--you can set up as &quot;Automatic&quot; or change settings to &quot;manual&quot; to control flash, brightness, white balance. I have exclusively used &quot;automatic&quot; so far, and it has worked flawlessly. You can do close-up photography (8-15 cm, or about 3-6 inches) and it has a digital telephoto feature that lets you enlarge the image.

All in all, this is a great buy for the money. I have been very well pleased. Click on this link to get a sample photo taken with this computer--no software enhancements, this photo was taken directly from the camera:
