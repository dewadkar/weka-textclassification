            The main reason we bought the Echo was its roomy interior.There are 5 in our family and I am 6'3&quot; tall,my one son is6'2&quot; tall and the rest are catching up.This causes a problem when you are looking for a car that is very economical and roomy.
When I thought of getting a new car I said to my wife &quot;lets go down to the Volkswagen dealership and see what they have in a Diesel Jetta&quot;(I am a 1986 diesel jetta owner myself)I figured I had so much use out of my Jetta my wife would like it as well.
We test drove what Volkswagen had on the lot and found the back seat was very low for us tall guys,so on to GM,then to Saturn,then to Dodge.We were becoming very discouraged at this point and then we saw an advertisment on TV about the Echo.It didn't look like the roomist car on the road but we went to look at it thinking that the Corrolla would be there anyway and we would take that for a drive.Well there was an Echo right beside a Corrolla and the Echo was higher.
My wife got in the drivers seat and I got in the backseat right behind her,wow lots of room and I didn't have to wedge myself in.The seller is driving the Echo,lots of power (105HP)with the VVT-I engine(this stands for variable valve timing with intelligence)and gets around 50MPG.The instrument cluster is in the middle of the dash and very readable(you don't have to duck and dive around the steering wheel to see the speedo)you sit high and it is easy to get in and out.The trunk is a good size and you get the 60/40 rear seats.If your looking for alot of toys the Echo is not your car,but if your looking for an affordable,zippy,economical roomy people mover this is it(especially if your tall)<br><br>
