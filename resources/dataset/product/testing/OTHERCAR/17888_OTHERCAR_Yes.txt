            Attention RL owners with alloy wheels!  Some of you may have noticed that the alloy wheels on your RL are painted with a silver paint and clearcoat. Not all RL wheels are like this, but most of the stock '96 and '97 wheels are.  They hold up well.  But when you install new tires or have your wheels balanced you'll probably see small chips in the paint where the old balancing weights were pulled off.

Most tire stores will say there is no way to avoid this and will probably not be willing to pay the $110 per wheel cost of having your wheels refinished.  Unfortunately, Acura does not list a paint code for the wheel paint and the parts counter will not carry wheel touch up paint.

I've found the matching paint in touch up.  It's a 1999 Honda color code number NH623M Satin Silver Clearcoat(M).  I imagine it's available from Honda.  It is also sold by Duracolor, the standard aftermarket touch-up paint you see in many parts stores.  Look for the Honda code.

You're not going to repaint a whole wheel with this stuff, but it could save you a bundle if you want to clean up those nagging nicks and keep your wheels looking good.  Remember to clean the wheel before applying paint.  Touch up - Stay up!<br><br>
