            After reading multiple enthusiastic reviews, I went out and ordered one of these.  A year later, I truly believe I could've done better.

WHAT I LOVE
*The size is perfect.  It fits right in your pocket, but is thick enough where you aren't scared you're going to break it.  It's also very easy to pick it up, turn it on, point, and shoot with one hand in a matter of seconds.

*The battery life is surprisingly good.  I've been able to go 3-4 weeks without recharging (or 150-200 pictures, about half with flash).  This is good, because once the batteries need charging, you're in trouble.

*Although things have to be set up perfectly, if you take a picture in a well-lit area, it looks lovely.  You can print out decent 8 x 11 pictures taken with this camera without pixelation or color issues.

*Sony's Memory Sticks are expensive, and the 8MB one that comes with this camera won't make it far.  Thankfully, generic ones are now available, and a 128MB stick will only run you around $40.

*Mac users will be delighted that this camera performs perfectly with iPhoto.  

WHAT I DON'T
*The included software is buggy and difficult to use.  Thankfully, you don't have to use it- you can simply drag the pictures from your camera, which is nice. 

*The controls and menus are poorly designed, to the point where you'll have to repeatedly search for options.  The instruction manual is no help.  Note to Sony- hire a translator.  

*The camera's automatic light levels are poor.  Dark pictures come out muddy, while exterior skies are often white, not blue.

WHAT I HATE
*The lack of optical zoom.  When you see "digital zoom" offered on any camera, run- it's worthless.  The moment you zoom in on anything your picture turns into a jagged, pixelated mess.

*There is no "enter" key- you simply press the center of the directional arrow button, which means you usually wind up hitting one of the arrows instead of enter.  

*The flash is bright beyond belief, even on it's lowest setting.  This is great if you want to take pictures of massive areas in the dark, but if you're trying to take a picture of a person or object, you'll find yourself with a big white blur most of the time.

*The battery charger is infuriating.  From the time you put the batteries in, it takes between 15-24 hours to recharge them.  The camera comes with no AC adapter for wall power, so you're cameraless while this occurs. 

*The shutter takes forever and is unpredictable.  Sometimes I'll hold the button for 3-4 seconds before it snaps a picture, and sometimes it only takes a split second.  Also, by holding down the button it adjusts the light levels and focus, so your picture can wind up looking nothing like what you saw on the screen when you hit the button.

In addition, the camera has had several serious defects and maintenance problems.  I've sent it to Sony twice, and still I have issues.  This is uncharacteristic of Sony, as their products tend to be relatively high-quality.  However, my friend bought this camera as well, and has had similar issues.

This isn't the worst camera I've used, but there are far better choices you can make.  I wholeheartedly recommend against any camera without optical zoom, and the poor design of this one seals it for me.

UPDATE-
Well, the bad news is it's dead...a short 15 months after purchase.  It was not abused, it was not overused...it was treated quite nicely in fact, so this type of failure is unconcionable.  To me, this type of failure proves a point that the quality of Sony electronics is heading downhill fast.  I've purchased a Canon now, and am much happier with it.
