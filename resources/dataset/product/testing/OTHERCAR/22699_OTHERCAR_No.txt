            My Plymouth Neon was the very first car I had ever bought. I was young and it was sporty, and colorful. Though these were the most important to me at the time, they are not the only reasons that I bought the car. It was spacious, easy to maneuver, and within my means. It was slightly used when I bought it; it had a mere 20,000 miles on it. It does get me from point a to point b, most of the time.
From the day I bought it I began to have problems. There is a corroded part in the brakes that was like that when I bought it. This in turn caused me to have the brakes replaced every few months. Finally someone let me know about the part, and it was fixed. It cost a pretty penny though. I had to have numerous problems in the engine fixed one time because my car died in the middle of the road, with no warning. The radio station changed itself, so I had to replace it. It has no power steering, which I did not know when I bought it, I had assumed that it did. This makes tight parking spaces and quick turns an impossibility. 
I thought the car was inexpensive when I got it. It was cheap. I have made up for every penny that I &quot;saved&quot; in repairs. It cost me my  time,and my safety every time it dies in an unknown territory. Every time I get into it I just hope and pray that I will actually make it to where I am going.
