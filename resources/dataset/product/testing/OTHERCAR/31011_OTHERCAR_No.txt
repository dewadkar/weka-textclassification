            My needs are geared toward carrying a family with an occasional Home Depot load.  The Dodge Ram 1500 SLT fits that need quite well for about 5,000 miles.  You do get that "Big Dog" feel while driving it and the view over the traffic is great.  But it goes downhill from there.  My mileage averages about 12 mpg with the 4.7L engine.  Funny, most of the other drivers that I meet seem ambivilent about the truck but the first comment they bring up is that we all wish the engine had more guts for that little mileage.  I hope everyone else had the recalls (outside mirror clips and blower motor wiring) taken care of.  I wasn't too concerned about the outside mirror clips but the blower motor catching on fire caught my attention.  Oh, and did I mention that my visors went flaccid around the 12,000 miles/1 year mark?  The dealership has them on order now.  Ditto the other reports on all the creaks, moans, rattles, and hums.  It's a surprisingly noisy vehicle on the highway.  If you don't have the step bar, get them!  Surprisingly easy to install (took me 30 minutes for both sides)too.  Do it yourself; the dealership wanted $250 to install them so I did it myself with just a couple of hand tools.  I got caught with the ABS brakes too.  The salesman said 4-way ABS.  When I got home and read the owners manual, that's when I noticed it was rear only.  That's a lick on me for not reading closer.  I live in the Northwest where it rains a lot and this is a factor.  Oh, and did I mention that the 4.7L engine is a dog?
