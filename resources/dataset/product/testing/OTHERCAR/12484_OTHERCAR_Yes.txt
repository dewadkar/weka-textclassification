            I just bought a Volvo S40 a few weeks ago and I love it!  I looked at a lot of luxury sedans and found the Volvo S40 to be competitive with BMWs, Mercedes, and Saabs in terms of handling, suspension, traction, turning, and acceleration.  In addition it is one of the safest cars on the market; it has dual front and side airbags and outperformed every other car in its class in crash tests.  These criteria alone were enough to persuade me to buy it, and after my decision I was pleasantly surprised at the price, which was well below any of the other luxury sedans I had looked at.  I got it fully loaded for about $28,000 and I know they can be purchased for a lot less.  So, I recommend this car to everyone in the market for a quick little luxury car, especially people who, like myself, wouldnï¿½t normally consider buying a Volvo.<br><br>
