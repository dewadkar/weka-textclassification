            I recently had the unfortunate chance to spend three weeks in one of these babies from a rental car company.  I am not big on horsepower nor a big speaker of performance in general.  That being said I just have to say that this car was the worst in smooth gear shifting and had no get up and go.

Now to the real disappointment for me, the interior.  The engineers who laid this beauty out need to be sent back to the aforementioned class.  Climate controls spread out all over the dashboard as well as A/C controls allow for only two options instead of being incorporated into the standard dash/panel/defrost selection.  Also, the drink holders in the car are neatly placed down as close to your feet as possible!  This is a small but important feature as I do not want to lean over and risk taking my eyes off the road when attempting to quench my thirst.  Another poorly designed feature is the arm rest residing on the drivers seat.  This is needs to be far more adjustable to accommodate drivers of varying height.  Finally, I could go into the aesthetics of the car, but when the designers were so far off target on the function there is enough to be done for the next model.
