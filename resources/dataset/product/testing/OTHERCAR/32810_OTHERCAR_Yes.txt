            This was the first car I purchased new and loved it to death.  I wanted a new car that was sporty and sleek for a great price and this was it.

Mine had 2 doors, a moon roof, cd player, tinted windows and was bright red.  The best car for a young single girl.  There was nothing better than cruising around town in it.

It got excellent gas mileage as I was driving almost a hundred miles a day.  With all the wear I was putting on it the newness wore off quick.  

It was in the shop twice.  The air conditioning went out the first summer and the gas pump went out about 2 years later.  Both were covered under warranty so no big deal.  

As my single life turned into married with children we sold my car to my sister who is a young single girl.  So far it is still alive and kicking with 80,000+ miles.
