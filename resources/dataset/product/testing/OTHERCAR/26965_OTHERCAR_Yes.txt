            I bought my Mitsubishi Galant LS because I can't afford a BMW.  I took advantage of 1.9% financing and paid about $25,000 for the car, which translates into $375 a month for 5 full years.  

I bought my car in July and now, two days after Christmas, all I can say is that I love it.   The superb stereo, the wonderful leather seats, the stylish trim, the power of the engine all suggest a luxury car.  

Cute men in BMW's always check me out, mistaking from the side my car for theirs.  Oh how happy this makes me!  

I bought my car from Carmax.com.  Circuit City owns them and they guarantee low no haggle pricing.  If you know what Mitsubishi you want this is a good way to get it.  I've put 7,500 miles on my car in 6 months and have had no problems.  I wish it didn't require the premium gasoline, but they few times I've cheated and put in the normal stuff I could really feel the loss of power. 

For me a happy day is cruising through traffic, 7 speakers blaring a good CD, moonroof open, singing my head off.  The keyless entry, automatic headlight shut off, the inability to lock your keys in the car (it outsmarts you and unlocks automatically if you leave them in the ignition) are just nice hints of luxury.  Also nice are the wood appointments inside, the valet key that unlocks everything except the glove box for security, the alarm, the one touch moonroof, and the fold down back seat for accomodating skis in the trunk.  I wish the trunk had a keyless entry but maybe that's a security feature?  

I really really wanted a BMW but couldn't afford $500 a month to buy and I hate leasing, so I found this compromise and am very happy.  By the time this baby is paid off, I'll have my dream car, but you know, this car is going to be tough to give up.

I think it looks best in black, followed by champagne.  The red looks a bit cheap to me.  They could also tweak the front grill a bit, its not quite there, but the countours of the sides and back are very sexy.  I love it!<br><br>
