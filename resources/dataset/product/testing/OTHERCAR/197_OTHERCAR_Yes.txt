            Thanks again for reading my reviews.

My experience with the Rodeo has led me to believe that Isuzu is making serious upgrades in the quality of their products. This is no exception: My overall satisfaction with this SUV is above average.

The first thing I notice when I get into my Rodeo is the height--at 6'2", it's a perfect step for me. For those who are shorter, the step bars (optional) make easy access. The seats aren't luxurious first class, but provide the right balance of roomy cushion with rugged durability, while maintaining a correct posture while driving. As for my long legs, I have no problems putting the seat all the way back, and the passenger behind me still has plenty of room to move around. It's a lot of what you'd expect from an SUV: the interior isn't flashy, but it has all the features within the right reaches. Everything seems to be placed where I'd naturally want it to be.

When I'm on the road, the suspension can be a little rough at times (on a bumpy road). The truck does have more side-to-side roll than I'd like, although I'm used to driving smaller cars. When I'm off-roading, there is a bit of wheel-shake but nothing excessive. The transmission holds up fine and shifts well under throttle. For highway use, I get better mileage turning off the 'Power Drive' feature.

The truck tows a load such as a boat very nicely and doesn't load down the back end.

The Rodeo's sound system is nice, but is lacking for those who want a deep, rich bass sound. All it really needs is a single 8" subwoofer (available direct from Isuzu as an option).
