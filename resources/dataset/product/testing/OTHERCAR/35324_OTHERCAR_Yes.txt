            It�s amazing how many different new trucks there are for sale.  Equally amazing is how many different ways you can get just one truck configured.  For example, speaking only of the Toyota Tacoma, here are SOME of your choices: 4x2 regular cab, 4x2 extra cab, pre-runner extra cab, pre-runner extra cab V-6, 4x4 extra cab V-6, pre-runner double cab V-6, S runner regular cab�. The list goes on from there.  

Sporting a freshened look for  2001 the Tacoma line of trucks has really grown.  The obvious comparison for the Tacoma is the Nissan Frontier, a line of trucks that has not grown quite as rapidly.  Yes the Frontier has added a Crew Cab, and yes they have an extended cab, but Nissan trucks feel as if their technology is firmly planted in the early 1990s.  

I am not a big Toyota fan, I think they have VERY poor customer service (Hyundai can give a rental car to its patrons during repairs, but Toyota can�t???), and lack the value found in many other brands.  For example, a Nissan Frontier XE comes standard with A/C, but it is extra on the Toyota.  Both have a published list price of just over $18,000.  But if you want to compare apples to apples, you�d have to add the A/C to the Toyota � then talk list price.  But objectivity demands a fair evaluation of just the vehicle without any perceptions getting in the way.

The Toyota advantage becomes obvious when considering the mechanical aspects, plus,.  the quality is there to back up their reputation.  Staying with the Nissan/Toyota comparison � Toyota�s V-6 gives you 20 more horsepower, 20 more lb. ft. torque,  12 more valves, 2 more cams, and still delivers better fuel economy by 1 mile per gallon.  Not to mention the longer bed, longer wheelbase, MUCH higher towing capacity (5000 Toyota  vs. 3500 Nissan) and a larger payload by almost 500 lbs.  This is not about liking one over the other, these are simply the facts.

Styling is always a personal choice, trucks like the Dodge Dakota and Nissan Frontier look more like trucks � like guys trucks.  The Toyota Tacoma looks a little softer, like it is trying to appeal to women - or those short, baby-faced, community college boys who wear turtle neck t-shirts and buy those hideous �bad boy� stickers� just softer somehow.  The truth is just the opposite, the Toyota beats the other Trucks in its class in many categories, with the possible exception of  the Ford Sport Trac.  The Tacoma is more round looking than many other trucks in its class, this is especially true when opting for the step side.  On style alone, the Frontier and Dakota win.

Behind the wheel it�s obvious where the more expensive Toyota�s engineers spent their time.  Ride and engine noise - the industry term is Noise/Vibration/Harshness (NVH) and the Toyota is engineered so well that little road or engine noise is heard in the cab.  Acceleration is brisk, but not neck snapping.  Toyota�s 3.4L engine feels �torquey� off the line.  Good for stump pulling?  I don�t know, and I am sure most owners will never find out.  It is comforting to know that the power is there when and if it�s needed.  The Tacoma V-6 produces 190 hp, and only the Ford Sport Trac (205hp) tops it in this class.

At highway speeds, the Toyota is almost car-like.  There is some body roll during moderate to hard cornering, but one would be hard pressed to call the suspension soft. The Nissan feels tighter and exhibits less lean when cornering. The Tacoma�s  Brakes are very grabby, but work well. The automatic transmission shifts up and down with no jolting, harshness or �hunting.�  The pre-runner package delivers exactly what it promises, a 4x4 look and ride height, without paying for stuff most owners will never use.

Inside the Tacoma, the dash layout looks and feels car-like and the switches all have a quality feel.  In contrast the Nissan�s interior is very sparse and minimalist, a little more �truck-y.�  The Toyota�s main gauges are easy to read, however the digital clock glows red and is difficult to read from behind the wheel.  Also, many controls such as ventilation, audio controls, and even the joystick type shifter are a bit of a stretch for the driver.  The Tacoma lacks the ergonomic perfection found in the Tundra or most Hondas.  

The extra cab is large enough for  3 or maybe 4 adults to ride a short distance (20-40 min) without too much discomfort, but getting in and out of that extended cab space  is difficult.  The double cab offers a lot more room (but is still difficult to get in and out of), a longer trip of up to 4 or 5 hours with four adults is very possible.  Worth special mention is the double center armrest/storage bin.  One folds back, only to reveal another storage bin almost equal  in size.  Seats are comfortable and supportive.  The Tacoma has a power driver seat as an option, but the manual version is almost better.  The stock stereo is as good as any in its class.

Overall the Tacoma Pre-runner is a very good truck, think of it as a mini-Tundra.  The smooth V-6 and car-like ride make others pale in comparison, and the Pre-runner package allows the driver to sit up high, without having to pay for a 4x4.  Toyota�s main disadvantage is value/features. When comparing other small trucks like the Nissan Frontier, remember you�ll be getting features like remote lock/unlock and A/C for a lower price than the Toyota.  On the other hand the Tacoma gives you much more truck in terms of towing, payload, and torque. If those things are important to you, go with the Tacoma.  It is a much more serious truck � even though it doesn�t look like it.
