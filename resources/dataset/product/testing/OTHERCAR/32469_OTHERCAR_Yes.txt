            You can't go wrong with the grand prix.  I have owned the car since 1997, and have very few problems with it.  It handles like a dream, with plenty of pickup for cruising by people on the highway.  This car handles very well against the wind, not being able to be pushed around at all.  It hugs the corners, even when taking a sharp one.  The suspension is fairly stiff, so if you are the type that enjoys a very responsive ride, this is the car for you.  It comes with a 3.1 liter V-6 engine, producing 160 horsepower.  The 16.5 gallon fuel tank will let you travel close to 400 miles before filling up.  It gets roughly 25 miles per gallon still on the highway.  One minor problem are the brakes.  I have had to take it in quite a few times to get it fixed, and no shop ever seems to get them to stop squeaking.  They also are underpowered, so quite a bit of foot power is used to stop the car.  Overall, it has done me well for these past 4 years, and i am looking forward to buying a 1998 Supercharged Grand Prix, because i was so impressed with how my Grand Prix has served me.
