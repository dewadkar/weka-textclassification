            I own a 1988 Isuzu Trooper LS.  I am the second owner, having had it for 10 years, and the truck now has over 167,000 miles on it.  I have owned 2 automobiles in my lifetime: a 1983 Nissan Sentra, and this truck.  

I have taken my Trooper through a number of harsh environments:  Southern Heat and Humidity, Northeastern Snow, Ice, and Salt, and now Western High Desert Balm.  My Trooper has performed far better than I had expected.  I have only recently decided to sell it to my brother and purchase a 1999 model through CarsDirect.  I only hope that in 10 years I will be able to write the same kind of glowing praise that I am writing now.

I kept the oil changed every 3,000 to 4,500 miles, rotated the tires, and performed other general maintenance as described in the Owner's Manual.  In my 10 years of ownership, I have only faced 2 relatively expensive repairs -- both times I had the cylinder head replaced.  But at 77,000 miles and 160,000 miles, I can't really complain.  Like I mentioned above, I have taken it places that have punished it severely.  In later years, I pushed it less and less, and haven't taken it &quot;off-roading&quot; in more than 5 years.  I had plenty of 4-wheel drive experience each winter in Northern New York State, so the truck didn't need to prove itself off road.

I don't think you could go wrong buying a Trooper.  Sure, it has evolved into a more luxurious truck, but that is its beauty -- it can take the punishment anytime, anywhere, anyhow.  Every year, Isuzu has added improvements without sacrificing the base strength of the truck.  It can go anywhere and tackle anything!

GO OUT AND DRIVE ONE YOURSELF!!!  AND THEN DO YOURSELF A FAVOR -- BUY ONE!!!
