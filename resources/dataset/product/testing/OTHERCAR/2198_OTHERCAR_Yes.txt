            I just purchased a 2000 Prelude in Crystal Metallic Blue (looks silver with a bluish tinit) with Honda's Sequential Sports Shift (automatic) which some poeople refer to as &quot;autostick.&quot; The care came with standard features such as moon roof, cd player, automatic door locks, side view mirrors and windows, as well as air conditioning. Unfortunately, leather interior is not standard and costs over $1,000! I did not purchase the spoiler (which comes standard on the SH model) becuase the dealer listed price for that was around $800. I did however buy the stock underbodykit which vastly improved the appearance of my car giving it a lowered stance.

The sticker price for a base model 2000 Prelude was $24,500 at the three delaerships i visited in the Bay Area. After tax and licenseing, a stock 2000 Prelude would be about $26,000 out the door. The dealership asked for about $28,000 for the Prelude i bought which included the stock bodykit (listed for $1,4000) and $100 for the four floor mats. It costs about $2,000 for tax and licensing which all adds up to about $28,000. If you wanted to buy the Type SH which includes the Active Torque Transfer System (a sort of traction control) the dealer would ask about $30,000 for basically the same car but would include the ATTS and different rims with higher rated tires. The price for a 2000 Prelude ranges from about $26,000 to as much as $33,000.

Its been a month now and i have put about 2,000 miles on my car. Overall, i am satisfied with my 2000 Honda Prelude. First off, i love the how the front end of the car looks with its large head lamps and long hood. I am glad i purchased the underbodykit because it adds to the sportiness of the car. The rear end of the car is simple yet unique with its rectangularish rear lights that are red at the top and clear on the bottom.  The side view is sleak as well. 

The interior is fairly roomy in the front and i am surprised that the back is not that cramped either. My friend has an older generation Prelude and the back sets were uncofortable to sit in but Honda has increased the amout of rear seating space in it's newer generation Prelude which my friends greatly appreacate. The controls in the car are easy to opperate and control. The center conole is kind of small although it has two compartments where you can put things. There are two cup holders right behind the shifter which makes it uncofortable to shift if larger drinks are placed there since it gets in the way when you try to shift. The stock stereo systedm is pretty good as well with Honda's own Acoustic Feedback System which filters out ourside noise before playing the music. The cloth seats are confortable too although i would prefer leather over it anyday.  One thing about the cloth seats that i do not like is that whenever i get out of my car and close the door, i always get shocked by the car which is really annoying!

Performance wise, i am somewhat disappointed with my car. Although it handles fiarly well, the stock tires that come standard on the Prelude does not let you take hard turns at speeds the Prelude is capable of. I have the sports shift on my car and it takes a minute before the car actually changes gear so there is a two second lag between when you shift up or down (plus or minus). Even when i rev the engine and floor the car, sometimes i feel like there is a shortage of power. It also takes a lot to get the car going because the VTEC doesn't kick in until around 5000 rpms. For the price, the 2000 Prelude preforms well and most importantly, the ride is stable and every move is precise. It is also a safe car with standard features such as abs brakes and driver and passenger airbags.

For a 19 year old, this car is great to get around and enjoyable to drive.  I would recommend this to those whe want something sporty, yet drivable on a daily basis.
