            My mate has this car as a loaner until the other car comes out of the shop (accident, Californians can't drive in the rain, you figure it out), and I must say that I really was surprised.  Our friends have teased us, saying that they expect to see this car turn into the Batmobile, and judging by what the interior looks like, I sometimes wonder this myself.

The features I like are the custom seats, which are very comfortable, the automatic door lock (you don't even have to lock the doors yourself - the car does it for you), and the way it handles on the road, and especially the freeway - it's a very smooth ride.  The instrument panels turn bright red when you turn the ignition, and we go back to the whole Batman thing.

I dislike the soundsystem, however, mostly because it automatically calibrates the sound by speed.  I tell you, there's nothing like getting your car groove (who is reading this that know how to do The Car Boogie?) on and then hearing the sound reduce to next to nothing, just because you're at a red light!  It's irritating!

Otherwise, I think I'd have to give serious consideration to this car when it came time to buy.
