            I finally got rid of my Grand Am. (Read my other reviews to see that sad ride.)

I happened into the Mitsubishi dealership in March 2002 after having visited several Toyota dealers and a Ford dealer. I hadn't actually considered a Mitsubishi in my pre-planning, but I did know something about them, with several family members and friends swearing by the reliability. And after that Grand Am, reliability is what I wanted. 

I tested a couple of other cars while there -- some used other models and the new Lancer. The Lancer was my favorite, even though I think the fake wood grain interior is one of the tackiest things I've ever seen. But the Lancer -- even though it's a cheaper car -- was going to be more expensive. I can't explain it all because I don't really understand it to this day. So we started talking about the Galant. I drove it, and fell in love almost immediately. 

Having had mostly American cars in my life, I'm always pleasantly surprised at the ride in a Japanese car, and the Galant has that down. It's smooth, the car is high enough that I never scrape the front, and talk about quiet!! No engine noise here. 

DESIGN 

The front is roomy and mostly comfy - the seat design does leave a little to be desired, but to be fair, I've had back problems in the last year, and I don't know that any car would be really comfy. I do nap in the car during my lunch break quite often though, and I've never had a problem drifting off, so I guess that says something for the comfort. :) 

All of the controls - air and stereo, etc - are well within reach without distraction (though I do actually miss the steering wheel stereo controls on the Grand Am somewhat). The dash displays are bright and cheery and easy to read. The sharp blue color is easy on the eyes. (A distinct difference from the fire red in my Grand Am.) The adjustable seatbelts hit the right spot and never irritate me at all. 

The fuzzy interior is one of my few complaints. It's pretty, but probably not too functional. I'm a smoker (yes, evil and bad I know), so I've already experienced the disadvantage here, as a little hot ash leaves an ugly mark in the fuzzy door panel. I can see wear over the years having the same sort of effect. I would prefer a vinyl door panel -- but that's probably more of a personal thing. 

The body design is sleek and sexy - I opted for the Silver one, and it's beautiful. Sporty and classic at the same time, and the silver accents on the 2002 model (as opposed to the red ones on the 2001 and earlier ones) add to the sleek look. The silver has the added advantage of not showing dirt unless you're really close too. 

The trunk is roooooooomy and easily accessible. 

The lack of an outside antenna is a nice design feature -- it's built into the rear window. Makes the car that much sleeker. 

With the windows down the air currents aren't that bad. My long hair does need to go up with all 4 of them down, but if it's just the drivers side and the passenger, it doesn't seem too bad. 

Somewhere, a low curb or parking stopper managed to break off a little piece of the front. I'm not too sure how to explain it, but it's left a little flap of plastic hanging in the front. There doesn't seem to be a way to repair it myself, and when I took it in for 7500 mile maintenance they weren't much help at the dealership either. But that's only mildly annoying, and yes, probably my own silly fault anyway. 

DRIVE

Like I mentioned before, practically silent. It's smooth and quiet all the way, clean turns and easy handling. After driving a clunking, heavy car like my Grand Am, I feel like it's nothing to handle at all. The fuel economy seems pretty average -- I haven't checked the actual gas mileage, but I think it promised 22/25. Not fabulous, but not a guzzler either. I drive an average of 1000 miles a month, and fill it up about every 2-3 weeks. 

My only complaint in this area have been the brakes. They've squeaked a lot off and on -- it seems to be worse after it's been running for an hour or so. At the 7500 mile maintenance they checked and serviced the brakes and declared no problems, and they haven't squeaked as much since then. Maybe LA is just dusty? 

The brakes still feel a bit strange to me too - but that's been explained as the difference between the ABS I had on the Grand Am, and the disc brakes on the Galant. I don't know, I'm not a mechanical type person. The brakes are responsive and work though. 

It's not a big power car, no racing anywhere for me, but it handles pulling in and out of the LA traffic easy enough. I'm able to speed up quickly enough when I need to. 

OPTIONS AND FEATURES

The "auto off" headlights are one of my favorite little features - I never have to touch the light controls at all. It's a silly little thing, but I love it. 

Keyless entry and the remote trunk release are wonderful things. I think this is almost standard on most new cars now, but this is my first one, and the convenience is outstanding. 

I've got power windows, locks, and mirrors - no complaints there. The sound system is more or less your average factory system. It loses some finesse at the higher volumes, but even though I'm a big music fan, I tend to find NPR more consoling in LA traffic, so I don't usually have the volume up too loud. CD player seems fine, no feeling either way there. 

The cruise control is easy to access and easy to set and control with a stick control rather than the more usual buttons on the steering wheel. 

The manual seat adjusting controls are relatively easy to handle. I'd rather have power adjusting, but that's one option I didn't get. 

AC is cold, heat is warm and toasty. Quickly warms up, though the rear defroster tends to be slow to work sometimes.  

The extra lighter slot / outlet would be great for anyone who uses these for cell phones and such. I don't have any of these gadgets though, so I use the outlet cover to hold a litter bag. Quite convenient I think. :) 

The interior lights are limited to the two map light style lights in the front. There's no light going to the back of the car -- no dome light here. This might be worrisome to me if I was carting kids or passengers, but I think I've had someone in the backseat once since I've gotten the car, so it hasn't been a problem for me. The good thing about that design is that it's really easy to reach up and pop one or both of the lights on, even while driving. 

OVERALL

I love this car really. The options and the sleek design are really good for the price. The Mitsubishi reliability has kept me happy so far -- though I haven't had the car for a whole year just yet. I'll keep you updated on that. It's great for a single person or couple with no kids. I've done a couple of small road trips so far, comfy enough I wasn't dying to get out of the car when we got there.  

I would definitely recommend this car to someone in a similar situation to me. :)
