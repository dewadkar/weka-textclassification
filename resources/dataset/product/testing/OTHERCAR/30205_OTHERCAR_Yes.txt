            I have owned my Isuzu kingcab pickup truck since 1992 when I bought it brand new with cash. This is the best and most reliable truck that I have had. The seats are extremely comfortable and the paint job on it by the factory is still holding up and in excellent condition. When I bought it brand new back in 1992 it was the last one on the lot with a Japanese built engine in it which I wanted. It has a 4 cylinder 136 horsepower engine. When I was looking at other pickup trucks to get the same engine with horsepower you had to go up to a V-6 engine in the Mazda and Nissan. So, I liked the idea of the Isuzu having a 4 cylinder engine with the engine having 136 horsepower. I also choose the Isuzu because the gas mileage on it for a pickup was outstanding. I get 20 miles to the gallon average which is great considering it is a pickup truck. The interior is very comfortable and has held up to this day. I also liked the amount of room that they gave you in the under the hood with the engine to work on it yourself. If your looking for a reliable pickup truck than try Isuzu, you won't be disappointed.<br><br>
