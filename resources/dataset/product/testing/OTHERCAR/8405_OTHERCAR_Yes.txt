            I've used the Olympus 600L for more than a year and I've been extremely pleased with the quality of images I've been able to create. The biggest advantage is the through-the-lens SLR-like viewfinder. I've been able to take some very adequate action shots (see http://jaguars.fuzzheads.org )outdoors. I've also been able to take some wonderful landscapes and closeup photos (see http://jomari.com/dad/desktops.html ).  If you are comfortable with traditional SLR cameras, you will love this camera.

Having said that, it is important to stress that this camera has some very real weaknesses.  This is NOT the best camera for indoor or low-light photography. The flash is adequate for photos within 1 foot to 10 feet, but the camera will disappoint in more demanding situations. Action shots outdoors in cloudy conditions are often blurry and a shaky hand will spoil almost all low-light photos.

The Olympus 600L has been replaced by the 620L, which offers a means of improving image quality in low-light situations through white-balance adjustments. The camera also comes with a hot-shoe feature for adding a stronger external flash. I've not used the 620L so I can't say how well the improvements work.

If you can get a good deal on the 600L (under $500) I'd strongly recommend getting the camera. Otherwise, I'd recommend moving up to the 620L or, better yet, getting Olympus' new 2.5 million pixel C-2500 SLR.

One other point: Get a battery recharger and keep the batteries in the charger when not in use.<br><br>
