            I had been looking for the perfect digital camera for nearly months now, and I wanted to find a camera with great quality for a great price.

Well, for the most part this was nearly impossible to find even though I searched far and wide across the internet for one.  My budget was 300 bucks and it seemed like there was no decent camera out there in the sub-300 dollar area.

Like I said before I searched all over the internet including places like www.pricewatch.com, but nothing that was that great of a deal seemed to show up.  I knew that Olympus was a decently good brand but I didnt have any of their cameras, nor did my friends so I didnt know what kind of quality their cameras were.

My dad suggested I look at www.officemax.com I yelled at him that Office Max never had good deals, but after searching at many store websites the lowest cost of this olympus camera being 300 bucks + shipping, I figured I'd give it a try.  Amazingly enough I found it for 280 bucks plus free one day shipping! By the way I chose this camera because from what the stats said it was the best bang for the buck, including an 8MB card, about 36 pictures.

The next day I received the package in the mail, and I quickly ripped it open.  The camera was everything I expected... and more! The picture quality, at 1.3 Mega Pixels was amazing, and the software that came with it was decent.  I would DEFINITLY recommend this camera to anyone who is looking around, the picture quality is great, and the camera is very easy on the billfold...  If you do not have a digital camera go out and buy this one now!
