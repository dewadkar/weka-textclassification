            If you have not heard the persistent rumors about Grand Cherokee mechanical problems then you have not spoken to a Grand Cherokee owner.
While new models have much improved fit and finish and reliability, they still deliver far more squawks than their competition.

You can expect ill fitting interior pieces rattling or squeaking, odd noises coming from somewhere under the vehicle and things like power window/lock switches breaking in the first six months.  Granted, my direct experience is with a top of the line Limited but I have heard the same issues from lesser model owners. 

If you complete four years or so of ownership without having any transmission problems you will have quite an accomplishment on your hands.  

By the way, gas mileage (as in any sport ute) is dismal.  Do not forego the V-8 thinking the V-6 will save an appreciable amount of gas.  They both will depress you if you leave the computer display on the miles-per-gallon mode.  

So you may think that I am really down on the Jeep?  Not at all.  The Limited (only the Limited) has a lot to offer.  In the right color, with leather, they are good looking and possess more than a little class.  Just know what you are getting in to- not the most reliable vehicle in the world of sport utes.
