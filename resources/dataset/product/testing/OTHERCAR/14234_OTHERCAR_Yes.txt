            This is a daily driver. 122,000 miles on it and the reliability has been great. The clutch has been a huge problem, but because of warranty coverage, I have only had to pay for its replacement once at 90,000 miles (the first replacement.) I had to replace the clutch again at 120,000 miles as well as the pedal assembly because it cause very noisy rattling and the pedal felt like it was a wall. Both front suspension arms cracked at the joint around 100,000 miles, the driver window motor had to be replaced and the seatbelt assembly was also replaced. Other than that, nothing has gone wrong with this car.

Don't buy this car expecting a rocket. The 2.0L four-cylinder is sluggish. Acceleration is not brisk around town, however if you can keep the revs above 4000, it feels fast. The torque peak is at 4600 and the hp peak is at 6800. The motor revs all the way to around 7200 rpm. It produces a great noise which has increased over time so it almost takes over the cockpit noise now. I don't mind it, but luxury conscious buyers should keep this in mind. I have not driven the automatic version of this car; I have the 5-speed. I can't imagine life without the manual.

The handling is great, by far the best characteristic of this small car. It features independent suspension all around to compliment the four disc brakes at the corners. Torque steer (often a problem with front wheel drive cars) is not a problem. The car encourages you to push it around corners, however when the limits are met, the car voices its displeasure. The small 14 inch wheels cause it to become somewhat unstable, however I can push it very confidently.

Besides the clutch some of the plastic in the interior rattles over stiff bumps or when the car is being accelerated at high rpm's. The problem only started getting bad about two years ago.

The interior is nothing special, as is the rest of the styling. The exterior is plain and boxy. The interior is nicely appointed with leather seats, steering wheel, shift knob and parking break lever. The stereo came standard as a tape deck, which I replaced with a CD player two years ago. I have yet to upgrade the stock speakers, but must now as the CD player has blown them out.

For the money, this car is great. You get great features and reliability plus great Infiniti service for around $6,000 used. I highly recommend the 5-speed. Check the leather and seatbelts for wear and cracking. Otherwise, I cannot report any problem areas to look at when buying. Not as tunable or as exciting as an Acura or other import, but worth a look at none the less.
