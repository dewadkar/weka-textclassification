            In my lifetime I have been lucky to own numerous Vws, starting from 1986 Golf Diesel, which is still my daily workhorse after over 200K miles on it, to my wife's 2003 Golf GLS, that I will be describing here, including two Passats and one Jetta in between. One thing that they all share, and that you notice right away when you drive any veedub is structural rigidity; basically the car feels rock solid despite its small size. Before I became a VW fan, I owned 3 different Hondas and thought they were best cars as far as engine, reliability and comfort, but it all changed when I first drove 1997 Jetta that my brother owned. Honda 4 cylinder doesn't even come close to the power that's available from VW 4 cylinder 115HP. Don't let the paper fool you, those 115 horsepower are complemented by 122 lb/ft torque. Tell me which Honda 4 cylinder engine has more torque than horsepower? Horsepower without torque is only good for driving downhill!

Now to my newest member of the family &#150 the 2003 VW Golf GLS. I purchased this baby few months ago, yet already managed to put quite a few miles on it, as I absolutely love to drive it whenever I can (my wife is a primary driver). I will try to be as objective as I can in this review, as just like any other car the Golf has its pros and cons.

So, let's start off with the good things. First &#150 the engine: I chose to go with 2.0 liter 4 cylinder engine, basically it is a classic engine now. This engine has been around since 1990, when they started putting it in Passats in 16v version. My Golf engine has 8 valves, thus resulting in simpler engine to work on but on the down side &#150 also sacrificing some horsepower. I like to buy things that are not latest and greatest, but rather had some time for the engineers to work on them, and improve them. Engine has great amount of torque, which helps dramatically because even though Golf is a pretty small car, it is also a pretty heavy car (about as heavy as Nissan Altima). When I am out on the freeway driving, and I need to pass somebody, I don't even need to downshift as the engine has enough torque to pull away for easy passing. It has been by far the most successful VW engine, and the most reliable VW engine over the years, as you can see by those 1995-1998 Jettas with well over 150000 miles on them driving around.
 
The transmission (automatic in my case, as my wife is unwilling to learn how to drive stickshift), is adaptive, meaning that if you start driving your car with a sporty manner, tending to put you pedal to the metal, it upshifts slower giving you some time to gain speed, but if you are hesitant off the stop light, it will upshift faster, thus saving you gas and creating better driving comfort. I have to say that transmissing shifts very smoothly.

The feel is awesome. Although it is not a sports car by any stretch of imagination, it manages curves with passion. The car feels like it is a lot bigger than it is, thanks to strength and rigidity of the construction. This is what German engineering is about &#150 building a car that doesn't feel like a tin can and is made for the driver's enjoyment. On the curves where recommended speed is 15 mph, I go 40 mph and there is no body roll whatsoever. The cabing is very quiet, with the exception of some road noise &#150 there is virtually no wind noise until you hit 60 mph.

The features are abundant. Some japanese luxury sedans don't dream about as many features as this &#147people's car&#148 has (Volkswagen means people's car). For example show me an upscale japanese sedan that has 8 airbags, heated seats, heated windshield wiper nozzles, heated mirrors, power everything, tilt and telescopic steering wheel, height adjustable driver and passanger seats, and Monsoon quality sound system all standard. The quality of materials and plastics that this interior is made out of is just amazing. It feels like a $40K car when you sit in it. The sound system really is great. I have read many reviews on this car before I bought it, and they all praised the sound system. I kind of dismissed those reviews because from my previos experience I knew that as soon as you buy new car, the paper cone speaker just don't cut it, so you have to replace them all as well as head unit. That's not the case with Monsoon system. The sound is clear, all 8 speakers work together beautifully to deliver highest quality sound.
 
Now the airbags: the car has driver's and passenger's airbas, as well as front and rear curtain airbags, as well as side airbags mounted in front seats. Also one nice detail: front airbags will deploy under different angle if you are not buckled up, so your chances of flying though the windshield in case of collision if you were stupid enough not to buckle up, are minimized. 

Now to the features: The seats are awesome. They offer lots of support for your back as well as side support. They are not fluffy or plushy, rather firm and comfortable on long trips. The only seats that are better than these, are Volvo seats. I've driven up and down the Highway 1 in California in these seats, and after over 5 hours of continuous driving, the only reason why I got out of these seats is to get some food and gas. That wasn't the case with Altima, my brother owns, where we had to stop every 2 hours, on our way to a wedding from Seattle to San Francisco. The vanity mirrors are illuminated but the lamps are not right next to the mirror flashing in your face so you can't see yourself at night, but rather above the mirror. Also the grab handles, when you release them the go back in place slowly, without making loud sound. If you sit in this car for little time and just take time to notice all the little details that went in here, it is just amazing. The engineers that designed this car, obviously love cars, and they made everything to make the ride as comfortable and safe as possible for the driver and the passengers. Interesting thing is that they don't tell you about all these little details in brochures, rather making you find out about them on your own and appreciate the thinking and attention that went into building this car.

Overall car feels like it's made out of steel (which it is), unlike some other cars that I won't list here. For example, when you wash the car's roof, it doesn't cave in when you press on it, doors have the solid sound and feel to them when you close them. Sunroof was designed very cleverly: you turn the dial as much as you want the sunroof to open, so you only have to take your eyes from the road for minimal amount of time, you don't have to press and hold the button until the sunroof opens. Also in case your sunroof motor dies, there is an emergency key to manually close the sunroof (that is the same with all European cars, but only few japanese cars have this feature, I know for sure that Honda doesnt' have it).

Now, the bad things: there really aren't any. The car developed a little squeak when you drive over the speed bumps, and I plan to visit local dealer about it. It is not an annoyance by any means, it is really hard to notice too, as you only can notice it when you know about it, but I still have the warranty so why not use it. Also, the fabric on the seats tends to accumulate lint and hairs and acts like a magnet for every little lint or piece of hair that is on your clothes. I also wish my wife knew how to drive a stickshift because due to car's weight it does feel little underpowered while climbing steep uphills; that problem is eliminated with 5 speed manual transmission. Also it is not a problem on the streets or highway; as I mentioned earlier, the car doesn't even need to downshift while passing others, it does downshift to 3rd gear when getting to the mountain pass (I live in Seattle, WA and go east of the Cascade range and over Snoqualmie pass at least once a month).

Overall I would recommend this car to anybody. I have heard a lot of people say that pricewise this car is expensive when compared to other cars in its class. I say it is not true. Honda Civic EX costs as much, as 2003 Golf GLS but doesn't come close to the Golf in quality of materials, quality and rigidity of structure, features or engine and transmission; it has 127hp on the paper, but it also has even less torque which translates in being unable to drive uphill with the car and 3 passengers. Ford Focus is $1000-2000 cheaper but while handling and the engines are nice, it really sucks in features, safety and equipment. Toyota... Well, we just can't find the car more bland than that, can we?... It's reliable - but so are most of todays imports (except Kias or Hyundais), has good engines and trannys but no attention to detail inside or outside whatsoever (by the way the person who designed interior deserves to be shot for color alone). Nissans are nice, have powerful engines and trannys, very good handling, but lack interior refinement and useful features (pretty crappy paintjobs too). I say, sit in Golf or Jetta for some time, take some time to look around the interior and notice all the details, then take the car for a drive &#150 and you are VW customer for life. After VW other cars in the same class feel like they should be at least $5000 cheaper for you to even consider them.
I hope this review was helpful to you, as I tried to be objective about the car, even though it looks like a biased opinion, it is not because the car is indeed great.
