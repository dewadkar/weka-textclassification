            I remember my first digital camera, a Vivitar ViviCam 2700.  I got it off an online auction for $100.00, I was so excited�until I realized what a low-end, cheap camera it was that ate AA batteries and had a crappy display.  I chalked it up to trial and error, gave it to my sister and started saving for my dream camera, a Sony Mavica FD7x.  I remember when the first generation Mavicas came out, the FD5 and the FD7.  I was working in sales at Computer City and longed for one every time I explained it to a customer.  I wanted the FD7 then with 10X zoom, but who the heck would shell out $800 bucks for one?!?  

So, 2 years later, I finally got the FD75.  I�ve had it for about 7 months now and like it a lot.  I mainly use it for web shots and quick pictures to e-mail to family, it�s very convenient using a floppy disk.

<b>Storage:</b>
The FD75 stores photos on a 1.44 MB floppy disk.  This is nice because I have disks everywhere that I can just erase and use as film.  When the disk is full, just use another one.  You don�t have to worry about deleting pictures to make room for more.  Unfortunately, floppy disks are big, requiring a big drive in the camera, making it larger and heavier that most other digital cameras, weighing it at 1 lb. 3.3 oz.  Also, it only takes pictures at a max resolution of 640 x 480 to keep the file size down.  This is nice for web posting or e-mailing, but not for professional photography.  

<b>Image Quality:</b>
As I said, the max resolution is only 640 x 480 in j-peg format.  I don�t recommend enlarging them, they get blurry and the color gets blocky.  The FD75 has an auto focus lens that does not work well in low lighting.  If you are taking a picture in the dark with flash, they still come out blurry.  In mid to high lighting, the auto focus works great.  Also in low lighting, it�s hard to see objects through the display on the camera.  The color can look blocky in bad lighting. 

The flash has 3 modes which are easy to set using the controls in the back.  There is a flash button that you just push to cycle through the modes or to turn the flash off.  I�ve found the highest mode on the flash is a little too bright for most situations and really don�t use it.  

The 10x optical zoom is nice, you can use it to take a picture of someone across the room and they won�t  know it.

<b>Battery:</b>
On the Sony specs, it says the battery can last up to 2.5 hours, but I find it last about 1.75 to 2 hours for me.  Which is still great compared to my old camera.  Also the battery is rechargeable and comes with a charger.  

<b>Picture Effects:</b>
The FD75 comes with 4 built in picture effects, negative, sepia (B&W with a brown tone), black & white and solarize.  These are fun to use, even though you will probably never need them.  I haven�t used then yet.  

There are 6 different programs modes for picture taking, portrait, beach and snow (for light backgrounds), sports (for fast pictures), landscape, sunset & moon (for dark backgrounds) and pan focus.  These are nice and easy to scroll with a one button control on the back, but you have to remember which display icon is for which mode.  But I have used these modes before and found them helpful.

<b>Controls:</b>
Because of the size, the controls in the back are easy to use and keep a good grip on the camera with one hand.  There is a navigational wheel to scroll through menus that�s easy to work.  The power switch is a little awkward, you have to hold it down for a second to turn it on.  There is a slide switch on the top for the zoom, rocker switch near display to control the brightness, a slide switch below the display to put it in camera or play mode.  Play mode just allows you to scroll through your pictures and delete them it needed.

<b>Display:</b>
The display is a 2.5 inch LCD on the back of the camera, much larger than most other digital cameras.  According to Sony�s specs, 84,260 pixels, is TFT and is backlight, basically it has great resolution.

I recommend this camera for web images and e-mail.  Basically anything that requires more convenience than quality.   The FD75 produces nice images, while keeping the file size down.
