<TEXT>
            Last May, I bought a 1997 Chevy Lumina.  My work situation requires a lot of driving, and I have put over 40,000 miles on my car in little over a year.  It now has over 110,000 miles on it and hasn't given me a bit of trouble.

Things I love:
     -Gas mileage:  With prices continuing to climb, my steady 29-30 highway miles per gallon has made this car a bargain.

     -Power:  I drive up and down a number of mountains, and can take them at 70 miles per hour (shh, don't tell the cops) with no drag on the engine.  Even with the air conditioner on high.

     -Handling:  Drives like a much smaller car, corners very well.

Things I hate:
     -Music:  It didn't come with a CD player.  My next one will.

I guess the best recommendation that I can give, is that my next car will definitely be another Lumina.<br><br>
