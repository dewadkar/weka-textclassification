            As I saw my 1999 <b>Intrigue</b> being driven away last month by the car dealer where I traded it in, I was surprisingly sad. 

This is a car that is packed with standard options that make your driving experience very nice. The first thing that needs to be mentioned here is the cornering lamps. THAT is a nice option. Anti-lock brakes are standard and wonderful. I just traded the <b>Intrigue</b> in on a 2002 Chevy <b>Impala</b>..there are no cornering lamps to be found on an <b>Impala</b>..and I had to pay extra for anti-lock brakes on the <b>Impala</b>. 

<b>Reasons to appreciate an <i>Intrigue</i>:</b>

1. I live in the snow belt. The <b>Intrigue</b> plowed through heavy snow (6 inches and more) for 3 straight winters without even hesitating. It RARELY slid on icy and snowy roads. It never hesitated to start on single-digit temperature mornings! In fact, this car NEVER failed to start for me.

2. I had one problem with this car in the 3 years I had it: a faulty transmission that was replaced when the car was a few months old. Other than that, the car never gave me one problem. 

3. The styling of this car is nice. It's stylish and sleek and not too "family car"-looking.

4.  I got MANY a compliment on this car. My boyfriend loved to drive it, and HE has an Oldsmobile <b>Aurora</b>! The interior is roomy and comfortable. The seats are comfortable.

5. The gas mileage was pretty good.

6. The paint job was high quality. After driving several cars with bad paint jobs (*cough* Pontiac!), the <b>Intrigue</b> was a nice surprise in this arena. The paint stayed shiny and new-looking for 3 years, through 3 winters and 3 hot summers, despite the fact that I was always too busy to wash and wax it. I had the <i>crimson</i> color exterior paint, which was a metallic light maroon.

7. In the 3 years I had this car, I never replaced anything - exhaust system, brakes, headlight bulbs, brake bulbs - nothing. In particular, the brakes lasted a VERY long time - over 30,000 miles! 

8. All the standard options that you don't have to pay extra for. Compare standard options on this car to any other car in its class and see what you come up with. (Anti-lock brakes, dual air bags, a V-6 engine and cornering lamps are the biggies here, in my opinion.)

9. The interior and exterior color options on this model year were outstanding. It's rare that you have a hard time making up your mind on color choices on a car! I finally chose the "pewter" cloth interior, which is light, and spilled MANY things on it, all of which came up easily with just a damp cloth.


<b>Things that can be improved on the <i>Intrigue</i>:</b>

1. The ride was not as smooth as it could have been.

2. The center console in the front seat is odd-shaped and served as a very poor arm rest.

3. The acceleration was not smooth and could be "jerky" at times.

I am somewhat sorry that I didn't get another <b>Intrigue</b> this time around. I love my new <b>Impala</b>, but it's still not an Oldsmobile. There's something special about Oldsmobiles!
