            I bought my Chevrolet Corsica about 3 years ago for around $9,000. At the time it only had 60,000 miles and drove beautifully. I thought I had gotten a dream car. Now it is 3 years later and I am steaming mad. My dream car has fallen apart! Despite excellent servicing by me (oil change every 3000 miles, new airfilter, yearly inspection etc...) my car has become a liability. It now has 100,000 miles on it and EVERYTHING is going bad at once...the brakes are shot, the shocks had to be replaced, the hoses on power steering blew out, the whole rack needs replacing, the radiator needs replaced, the muffler needs replaced, and the transmission is having problems. The paint started peeling (for no reason) on the top of the car and it looks as if the car has some horrible skin disease. I would not recommend you buy this type of car unless you can dump it before it hits 100,000 miles, everything was fine until it hit that mark.<br><br>
