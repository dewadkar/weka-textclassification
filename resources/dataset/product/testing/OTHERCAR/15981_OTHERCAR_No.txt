            Two test drives in this maddeningly close-but-no-cigar car left me wondering what Honda was thinking about.  First, the positives: it handles like an intuitive extension of your body, with perfect balance and tremendous grip/response.  It appears to be of tremendously high build quality - you won't detect a rattle or any sign of looseness. The solidity and tightness of the structure no doubt let the intelligently designed suspension and steering do their work well.  The six-speed gearbox shifted precisely and cleanly. But the engine.....

There's a reason that race cars are impractical on the road, and the S2000, Honda's effort to emulate race technology on in a road car, is a graphic illustration why.  This engine must be revved well into the VTEC zone (6K RPM and beyond) to exact performance, and below that, there's not much home.  Driven sedately, the car feels downright lethargic.  Driven to obtain power, you always feel like you're trying to race someone.  There's just no in-between.  Face it Honda, this car is a toy, not a livable daily road car, unless the driver is a constantly  wired, frustrated F-1 race car driver. 

The other deficiencies:  although they woke up and added a glass rear window, the top is still minimalist and unlined;  wind-rush is noticeable from 45 MPH upward.  Yet they bothered to power-enable the action of this top - why? (Miata tops of about the same size work fine without power)  Save the weight of this power-equipment, and line the top, for pity sake!  Add a real glove compartment too, not the silly little near-vertical thing between the seats, guaranteed to dump its contents when you open it. Other interior quibbles (besides the so-so stereo) - the silly arced-bar-graph tach and digital speedo look like they are worthy of an '80's Nissan Z-car.  When will car makers learn that every time they insist on their "better idea" for these two instruments, they eventually re-discover that nice, classic, readable analog instruments work best.  

In the end, the car just begs out for a more compromising engine, and some minor attention to the detail deficiencies noted.  Why didn't Honda just figure out a good way to drop their fine, compact, and light 3.0/3.2 V-6 into the chassis (maybe move the battery to the trunk for better balance), team it with the six speed and some good sound insulation, and they'd have the perfect roadster. Make them in realistic numbers and they'd sell the daylights out of them.  Heck, I would have bought one, instead of walking away from the dealer without buying their car.  In other words, make a true Nissan 350Z competitor, before the new Z arrives and makes S2000 buyers spending more money look pretty foolish.
   
It's just so weird that Honda should trickle such a silly, pathetic number of this magnificent "near-miss" (many of which apparently end up on the used-car market very quickly - owners tiring of contant race-mode?).  One wonders why they bother.
