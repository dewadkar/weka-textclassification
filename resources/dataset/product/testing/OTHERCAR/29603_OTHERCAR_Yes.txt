            I had the truck less than 24 hours and had already been asked twice "Does that thing have a Hemi?"  Lucky for me it does or I'd have to dejectedly say "no."

Of course, having the Hemi does have more advantages than being able to say "Yeah, it's got a hemi!"  For example, imagine a Chevy Avalanche pulls up next to you at a red light.  The Chevy driver's got the big Vortec V8.  He thinks it's the bomb.  You crush his little world when the light turns green.  Or, for example, a snot-nosed punk in a 87 Mustang LX 5.0 thinks he's going to show you his tail-lights at the Red-Light derby.  Now let's pretend he's not crying to his buddy at the Fast and Furious store about needing nitrous to keep up with you.  Yes, you can pretend, but it won't change the fact he's on the phone making that call...

By now you're probably wanting to know more about the truck than how fast it is.  OK, I'll bite.  The truck I purchased is a Ram 1500 Laramie Quad-Cab with the sport appearance package, DVD navigation system, Bose Infinity speakers and Sport Leather seating.  It's also got a towing package, bed liner and 20" aluminum alloy wheels with Goodyear Eagle 275/50 tires.  

The ride is slightly truckish in that the suspension is stiff and you get a little bit of a thump when going over large irregularities in the road.  Adding weight to the bed will help, of course.  Handling is pretty good, owing greatly to the wide and lower than truck normal profile tires and just the overall goodness of the design.  This isn't your GM or Ford slush-box suspension.  It tracks a straight line on the freeway, turns with a minimum of body roll, and doesn't get squirly when you hit the gas mid-turn.

The interior is nearly perfect.  Fit and finish are superb for a pickup.  Chevy can't compete in this arena.  The 2004 F-150 is just as nice, but you can't get the deals on them that you can the Dodge.  There's seating for six adults or four adults and two car seats.  The leather is a bit hard and the seats could use a bit more sculpting in the butt.  The only real complaint comes from the exhaust note which seems to be a constant reminder that "yeah, it's got a hemi".  It's not necessary because the person in control of the go-fast pedal already is well aware of that fact.  It's not tiring but it does prevent you from being able to achieve a nice quietness when traveling with the radio off.

There are storage bins everywhere in the interior.  All of the rear seats and the front-center seat all have under-seat storage.  The rear bench is a 60-40 split with the 60% on the passenger side.  In addition to the under seat storage, the rear seats can also be folded up to reveal a metal package shelf that can be extended over the floorboard which makes hauling large, heavy items inside the truck possible.  The shelf has a 600-lb weight limit and is water-tight to prevent messing up the carpet.  Neither Ford or Chevy offer this feature.

The factory bed liner includes several marine-style tie-downs as well and slots for building a parcel shelf from 2x4s.  The Sport Appearance package includes a gorgeous front bumper with a serious air-dam that really ratchets up the aggressiveness of this truck.  As if the exhaust note and HEMI Magnum emblems didn't already warn would-be street racers, the body package should complete the thought process.  The only trucks out there that can beat this thing are the Ford SVT Lightening and the Ram SRT/10.  The Chevy Silverado SS is a putty-tat compared to the Hemi.

Another area where Dodge trumps both Ford and Chevy is the warranty.  The Ram comes with the ubiquitous 3 years/36,000 mile bumper-to-bumper warranty as well as a 7 years/70,000 powertrain warranty which will cost you extra with Ford or Chevy.

So far I love my truck.  I'll update this review in a year and see how it stacks up over time.
