            I love this car.  That is about all I need to say, but I suppose that I should say why.  When it was first suggested to me to look at the Volkswagon Cabrio, I immediately said, &quot;there is no way I am going to drive that girly car.&quot;  Even as a female, I was concerned that I would be confused with some mall addicted, brainless girl who could substitute for the main character in Clueless.  After driving the car and putting the top down, I was hooked.  Inside, the cabrio is roomy enough for four people and the dashboard and console are driver friendly.  The one touch convertible top is fantastic and is easy to put up, especially when you need to do it fast, like if it is raining.  Even my fiance loves to drive my car.  When we go out in it, he is always taking the top down and comenting on its beauty.  

I actually drive the stick shift version of this car and find that it drives well and picks up speed quickly.  I have had some problems with a rattle here and there, but my dealership deals with it quickly and usually finds that it is not a major production.  Also, this car gets great gas mileage as it gets about 25-30 miles to the gallon.

If your looking for a fun car that is pracctical too, you will love the cabrio  <br><br>
