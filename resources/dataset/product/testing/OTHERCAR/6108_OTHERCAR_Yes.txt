            I purshased this auto for my wife back in Febuary 2000. The following describes features found on our (her) model.

2000 model year Chevrolet Impala LS (sporty model)
Electric seats
Heated seats
CD Cassette delco/Bose stereo

4.8 litter engine series 2
antilock brakes
power windows locks

Pretty much the works. 
My only complaint about this car is the stereo, the bass seems too light. Trust me I am not one of those nuts that drive around with the bass thumping so hard it makes your cardiac rythms skip.

The car rides so well,like it is on air!
The seats have so many positions that it is astounding.
Interior engine noise is somewhere around ZERO!

The engine is so smooth and peppy that I would challenge any BMW!
Braking is good.
Handling the curves is a Drivers dream. Tight,very tight!

I think the outlay of the dash could have been designed a little better.
I don't like the steering wheel either. It doesn't have proper hand placement for the curly roads.(Can you tell that I love driving this car)
I have had this car up to 100 mph on a test track and at this speed it is as smooth as it is at 30 mph.

USE MOBIL 1 synthetic, its worth the money!
