            I never thought I'd own an SUV, much less enjoy it, but I've been driving my 1995 Pathfinder for a few months now and am mostly very happy with it. I'm well-acquainted with the previous owner, so I have a fair idea of its history, even having had the opportunity to drive it around some a couple of years ago.

It's surprisingly similar to a late-80s Nissan pickup. The ride and V6 engine performance of are the Pathfinder are not substantially different from such a vehicle, although the handling and interior are a step up. Compared to a friend's '92 Toyota 4Runner, the Nissan definitely drives more like a regular truck. That's fine for me, but someone looking for car-like handling in an SUV should probably avoid this model-year (and SUVs generally).

That said, this truck handles pretty well and the 4-wheel drive transmission is a real asset if you have to drive in snow or mud conditions; definitely superior to 2-wheel drive vehicles. It is actually fun to drive, which is more than I can say for most trucks and many cars. The Pathfinder's unusually low center-of-gravity probably contributes a lot to its feeling of stability.

Everything on the Pathfinder seems to fit well and operate smoothly. It's been my experience that made-in-Japan vehicles often have quality of construction and attention to manufacturing detail not found in most domestically-made vehicles. That certainly seems to be the case here.

The seats are quite comfortable, especially considering it's a truck - good enough for long road trips.

The truck feels roomy, though not as much as a 4Runner. SUVs generally are not made for hauling, but the cargo space seems more than adequate, given that this is a small SUV with five seats, and if you have a roof rack, you can carry up to 80 pounds of goods up above. 

The factory AM/FM stereo cassette system is excellent - better than any aftermarket stereo I've had in other cars. The factory alarm system also works, and works well - better than most aftermarket systems - another first, in my experience.

Heating and cooling are also quite good, as are instruments and controls. Window defrosting works exceptionally well. It's a great vehicle for cold climates.

The truck also has user-adjustable child-proof locks and windows.

My only two gripes are that the truck feels underpowered at times, and has poor fuel economy for city driving - about 15 mpg. For highway driving, it gets about 20, sometimes a bit more. Power problems can be offset somewhat by turning off overdrive and by means of a switch which causes the transmission shift points to increase, if you desire a feeling of more power. Unfortunately, no such workarounds exist for fuel economy. In all fairness, it's a heavy little truck with an automatic transmission and 4-wheel drive. I'd feel fine about the mileage if it just had a little more power.

Overall, I like this truck and have no regrets about it. I expect to keep driving it for many years. I'd recommend a 1995 Pathfinder to anyone looking for a small SUV with good reliability, decent ride and handling, and reasonable cost-of-ownership.<br><br>
