            The HP 320 Digital Camera was a great buy when I wanted to get a new digital camera. It has a 2.1 Megapixel Image Quality for todays needs.

<b>Some features you will need to know about the HP 320</b>:
2.1 Megapixel of image quality makes it easy to print your pictures with decent quality.

<b>Memory</b>
8MB of internal memory so you wont have to buy memory for the camera until you want to expand it to take more pictures.

<b>Short Video Clips</b>
With this you can take short video clips of 30 seconds which almost use up all the camera memory. Each video clip takes about at least 3mb of video from the camera. If you want to take a lot of video clips be sure to get an extra SD digital camera memory for it.

<b>USB</b>
Easy plug n play with the usb lets you upload your pictures fast and easy with the HP 320's software you can do all kinds of goodies with the picture with the editing program.

<b>Digital Zoom</b>
The HP 320 zooms at 4x Digital Zoom with no Manual zooms however it can be used for trying to take a picture of something far away but takes away the image quality a lot.

<b>Auto Flash</b>
The camera has different sets of flashes, they include auto flash, Red-eye meaning to take the red eye out of pictures which takes more time to save the picture when you take the picture.

<b>Image Quality</b>
You have 3 settings for the camera's picture quality which are Good that is the lowest quality that can take about 336 pictures on a 32mb memory. Better quality which can take about 58 pictures on 32mb of memory and then the best quality can take up to 32 pictures on a 32mb memory and about 8 pictures on the internal 8mb memory that comes with the camera.

<b>Battery Life</b>
Battery life can be short if you use cheap batteries but I would recommend buying the rechargeable batteries for the camera which can save you a lot of money on buying batteries.

Also the HP 320 comes with editing software to make your pictures fun or do whatever you want with them.
