            The honda crx is definately a nice car.It's a really popular car for those import fans.Too bad they don't make them anymore but there was a rumor about them replacing the honda del sol's. I've been waiting for that to happen.Well the is really quick and compact. If you're in this car and in a hurry don't worry because this car is so small it could cut right into any little space.Looking for parking?Hehehe this car could fit in any space.For the people thats into imports this is a really nice car to fix up and has lots of parts for you to build more horsepower if you are in to speed.Some of the fastest imports are CRX's. <br><br>
