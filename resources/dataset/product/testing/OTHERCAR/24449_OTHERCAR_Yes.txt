            I bought this camera new in November of 2000. I searched for about a month before buying. I was first looking at a jvc digital camera with 3.3 megapixel, but only later found out that only a few people really need 3.3, I find the 2.1 to be great for everything I use it for! I never even considered a Sony camera because I thought it was out of my price range, but on the day I was ready to purchase I saw this in the display case and asked to look at it, I decided with in 5 minutes to purchase it. I find the 4 mb card to be too small, so I went and got a 16 mb card, that is sufficient. I wouldn't recommend spending the extra money on the 64 mb card. I shoot most of my pictures in the 640X480 resolution, so the 16 mb card takes about 245 pictures on that card. I love the features of this camera, my favorite is the rotating LCD screen, this is very useful, plus it protects itself for you. I also like how you can change resolution size and zoom in on pictures that you have taken, while they are still in the camera. People look at me like I am crazy when I tell them how much I spent on the camera, but it is worth every cent! As always, Sony has put out an excellent product!!!
