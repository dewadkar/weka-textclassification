            For my 21st birthday, I was given this car by my parents. Although it doesn't look very &quot;sporty&quot; I decided to go along with my &quot;saftey obsessed&quot; father and give it a chance. While HE was drooling all over the side-impact airbags, anti-lock breaks and other safety features, *I* was pleased to learn that the car came with a VIP warranty (if you get the option of selecting this warranty, I would suggest you TAKE IT, it's a great deal!) the reliability, and simple CONVENIENCE of this car. My favorite thing about the Volvo 850 is the fact that, although it has many options and features, everything is easy to understand. 

The car runs smoothly and is easy to move around. (I like to say that it FEELS like a small car, when, in fact, it's rather roomy). The heating and cooling are quick and can be adjusted from either side (in other words, you could, theoretically, have heat going on one side and air conditioning on the other.) 

I would recommend this car to anyone that can afford it. Yes, it is a rather pricey car, but it is very worth it considering the safety, and reliability involved. 

Happy driving!<br><br>
