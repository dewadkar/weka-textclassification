            The camera is a good value for someone either new to digital who wants to get something relatively inexpensive and easy which takes "ok" photos or someone who wants to stay under $200 range.  

When I say "ok" photos, I mean a camera, for example, used for fun and for capturing everyday memories with, or photos taken here and there without a lot of thought and planning, let's say, for sharing with family in faraway places through email.  But if you are really into taking pictures and putting them up for years in frames, you might want to go a step up.  But just for showing you're friends or shooting your friends at a party, and wanting to spend $200, the camera will do just fine, and then I would say it takes nice shots for the price.  

All in all, in the end this camera almost costs nothing when you factor in the price of film and how much you would be spending with a 35 mm and what your saving not having to pay for all that film and developing of all those everyday shots that a lot of times end up sitting in a closet.

In December 2001 I bought this camera in Staples for about $200.  It is a good price in the store, you might be able to find one online for less, problem is many sites I would think would no longer carry it cause it's been out a while, as I write this in summer 2002.  

Back then, (and maybe still now) it was the only 2 megapixel camera for that price around I could find.  And even though they say megapixel really only matters when enlarging photos, which I agree with in many ways (I have another 2 megapixel, Nikon 775 and the difference in quality is noticeable), I had the feeling that 1 megapixel these days is too little.

The camera is easy to use, easy to delete photos from, and the software it comes with is very easy and functional.  Downloading photos to the computer is a simple experience.  
A very good beginner camera.  A good value.  

The camera comes with 8 mb of compact flash, which is equivalent to film.  This is too little.  You will probably feel the inclination to upgrade shortly after the camera doesn't let you take more than about 7 highest quality photos and you don't want to delete any to make room, and you can't get to a computer to download them off, and then you end up missing that great shot!  If you buy additional 64 mb, it will cost you about $40 online and it is well worth it.  I ordered mine from buy.com and I had a good experience.  

I also recommend buying 4 AA rechargeable batteries and charger.  The camera comes with batteries that last like 30 shots, I'm estimating, and then you throw them away.  Waste.  I guess they get you started, but don't be misled, they will go in no time!  Especially when you are not slowed down by the boundaries of film.

The thing that irks me about this camera which might not be a big deal to some, is that is has NO lens cover, so I worry about the lens getting scratched.  So I would buy a small camera bag to protect the lens and camera, also which it doesn't come with.

The camera has like two zoom modes, which are basic, but convenient.  It also has self timer mode and a flash.  The pictures with limited light are ok, some come out better than others.

You get to see a photo after you've taken it on the viewfinder on the back of the camera and it takes almost no time for it to produce.

Bottom line, it is simple, it pays for itself, it does the job.  Maybe not an excellent quality job, but that comes with a higher price.  For what you pay, you get a good deal I think, based on my comparision with my higher end, double the price 2 megapixel camera.
