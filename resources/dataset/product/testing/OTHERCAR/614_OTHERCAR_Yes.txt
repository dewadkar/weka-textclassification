            I bought this car after high school graduation, and it has served me well for all of the 80,000 miles I have driven it.  It's combination of great gas mileage (30-37 mpg), and ultimate reliability made this car the perfect choice for a first car.  The $10,000 price tag, and very competitive warranty made the Nissan Sentra an obvious choice.  I chose a manual transmission and the GXE model level, providing all the power amenities, and a sporting feel.  The only dislike I have for this car is the seats, which due to their lack of adjustment may prove a little bit uncomfortable in trips over 8 hours.  Aside from that, the Sentra has given me reliable, safe service in the four years i have owned it.  This car is a must buy for anyone who enjoys a good value, safety, and economy.  As a first car, or a vehicle for trips to college, the Nissan Sentra is definitly a good choice.<br><br>
