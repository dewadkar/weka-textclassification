            This camera was originally my mother's and then she went out and bought a new one so I inherited it.  I can not say enough about this camera.  It is fantastic.  I took it on a 10 day trip to France and Great Britain and it was phenomenal.  The biggest drawback was the weight and bulkiness of it but that did not create any real problems.  And the pictures came out fantastic.  You don't have to worry about any memory sticks, etc.  And I had purchased an extra battery so I was never in danger of not having a charged battery to use.  It takes floppy disks to store your pictures and using the standard quality, you can fit at least 20 pictures on a disk.  I took about 15 disks worth of pictures while i was there.  And they all came out fantastic.  I took still pictures and even took pictures while we were driving and the pictures came out as though we were standing still.  And still, the greatest thing about that is all you have to do is pop in the disk and you can send off the pictures to anyone you want.  Or you can go to any online photo co. such as snapfish or shutterfly(my favorite)and have them developed there.  

The only drawback when using the standard quality selection is that they can not be blown up to any bigger than 4 x 6.  At least that it what it says but actually, i tried one picture and it came out just as good at 8x10 as it looked at 4x6.  
You can change the type of picture you want to take by choosing different styles.  You can take black and white as well as color.  It's like 5 cameras in one.  You can change the exposure to night, day, beach, etc.  You can't find all of this in one camera anywhere else.

It also has a timer so you can actually be in some of the pictures, if you want.  And the best thing is the movie part of it.  It's a camera and a Mpeg recorder all in one.  You can make a little home movie to send to your friends.  And it's good quality too.  The microphone worked great.  And the picture quality is great too. And lastly, you can play back anything you have recorded right there on the camera.  Pictures, movies, whatever it is, you can see the quality right there and you have the ability to keep or delete.  Simple as that.

Unfortunately, a child of a friend of ours dropped it from the counter and it fell on marble flooring and now it doesn't work.  So it has to go into the shop.  So i will update how much it costs to fix and what was wrong with it so owners out there can get a feel for how much it might run them if they need to get repairs.
