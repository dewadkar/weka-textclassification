            In 1996 my 1985 LeBaron was on its last leg. We were about to have our first child, so we needed to find an inexpensive, yet reliable and reasonably new (and hopefully attractive) car. Sounded like a tough order to fill. We looked around at small cars like Escorts, Proteges, Cavaliers.....etc. We went to a locally owned used car lot in town and saw a gold 1993 Saturn which had about 69,000 miles on it. We knew that that was rather high mileage, but we took it for a spin. We had our mechanic neighbor look at it. He said everything looked fine and that he'd heard good things about Saturns, so we ended up buying it. 

We've had it for 3 1/2 years, and other than scheduled maint., we have had to only have a new alternator and a new belt put in, totaling less than $300 in unexpected repairs. It is a very smooth-running car, with only a few rattles when we're driving on the interstate. We have taken it on several 600-mile round trips to our hometown. The exterior still looks wonderful and shiny, and the interior is attractive, with all the controls being within comfortable reach of the driver. I would say this isn't a car, though for especially tall people in the backseat, as there's not much legroom, but it has suited our needs fine. The trunk has a decent amount of space for our week-long vacations. One side of the back seat folds down for more flexible storage. 

We liked our 1993 Saturn so much, that when our Nissan was ready to be sold, that we bought another Saturn, a 1997 SL2. We plan to continue buying Saturns.<br><br>
