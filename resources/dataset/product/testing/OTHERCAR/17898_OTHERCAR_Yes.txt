            After many years of station wagons and sub-compacts when the children were growing up, (no mini-vans then), my wife and I began moving up the automobile food chain.  From Plymouth to Ford to Buick, we have had a succession of new cars.  Finally, I decided she deserved a true luxury car.  I have never been overly impressed by the German and Japanese manufacturers.  I knew that U.S. cars had finally regained a solid, competitive footing.  Ever since I was a kid growing up in the 50's and early 60's, I knew Cadillac was what I always wanted.

We looked at the Deville line and settled on the Concours (now replaced by the DTS).  I liked the full console and the 300 HP Northstar V-8.  The techno wizardry from Cadillac was impressive the moment I drove off the dealers lot.  Stabili-Trac is terrific, making constant adjustments in the suspension as the road surface changes.  Braking is sure and straight.  No fade whatsoever.  Front and side airbags add to the many safety features designed into this vehicle.  The power of the Northstar is incredible, particularly for a car this size.  At 60 mph when the accelerator is put to the floor, hold on!  It will pull you into the seat.  Magnificent handling and performance.  

The interior is leather with REAL wood trim, not a laminate.  The seats are heated with variable lumbar support.  I am a large man with a chronic lower back problem, but am extremely comfortable in these seats, even on extended trips.  Back seat leg, hip and head room is exactly the same as the front.  Passengers have their own climate control panel.

I have owned approximately 12 new cars in my life (yes, three were Nissan)and I can honestly say this is the finest automobile I have ever owned.  We will be trading the 98 Deville on a 2001 DTS early this spring.  I can hardly wait.  Do yourselves a favor.  Before you get caught-up in the Mercedes, BMW, Lexus and Jaguar hype, check out the beautiful new Caddies.  Quite a car.<br><br>
