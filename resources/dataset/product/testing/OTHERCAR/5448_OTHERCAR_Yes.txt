            I test drove the Sentra, Corrolla, and Daewoo Nubira. The Elantra was much bigger than the Sentra and Corrolla. It was about the same size as the Daewoo, but is put together much more solid. I'm not a small guy (6'1/245 lbs) and I fit into the Elantra with ease. I can put the seat all the way back and my kids have enough room. I didn't even look at the Honda Civic after driving the Elantra. The Honda is over-priced. My experience with the dealer was a very pleasant one. They let me take the car for the day without a sales person to hover over me. I took the car and put my kids car seats in it, piled the kids in and went about my daily routine. It did everything that I needed it to do. It had enough power,size and it looks great on top of of all that. It is the best car that I have owned so far. You can't beat the price for the amount of car you get. My sister owns a 2001 Elantra and loves it also. Hyundai has won me over with its quality car for a great price. Did I mention that I paid less for a 2002 Elantra loaded than I paid for a new Saturn equipped with much less in 1995. (The Saturn was a piece of junk!) I highly recommend the Elantra to anyone who does not want to pay alot, but wants a great car. Also, how can you beat the 10 yr/100,000 mile warranty.
