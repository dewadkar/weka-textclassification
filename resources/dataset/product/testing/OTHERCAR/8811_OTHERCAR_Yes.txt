            I recently purchased a Honda Accord 2000 Sedan EX V6 having virtually all the options offer by Honda.

I evaluated almost every car in this class from the Camry to the Malibu to the Passat to the Mazda 626.  And you know what?  I came to the conclusion that of that group, the Honda Accord *might* not be the nicest car, but is *certainly* the nicest car for the money.

My previous car was a 1995 Ford Escort, and while it was reliable, it was a little short on comfort, power, and style.  

The Accord is sweet.  The smooth, tight ride is nice.  The power is almost dangerous!  The car is so quiet that I frequently find myself going much faster than I thought I was, as the road noise doesn't give you much of a clue.  &quot;Oh c$@p!  I'm going 85 again!&quot;  I don't know the specific speed/power zero-to-sixty statistic, but suffice it to say that if you want the Accord to get up and go, it GOES!  ZOOM!

The car is comfortable.  The leather seats feel good, and the leg room is more than adequate in both the front and back.  My two kids car-seats fit in the back seat with plenty of room to spare.  It is easy to drive -- the stereo controls on the steering wheel are extremely handy.  The controls are intuitive.  The automatic climate control is great.  Keeps you cool, or warm, as needed.

As far as style goes, the Accord, while being somewhat vanilla (as a very popular car) it still looks good, and it is a huge step up from my Escort.  I see everything through the eyes of a father of two -- and as such, I declare the Accord V6 EX sedan an excellent family car.  It drives nicely, with power and comfort.  It looks stylish.

I would highly recommend this car to anyone, particularly families.<br><br>
