            This is the best van I could find for my money.  I had previously owned a 1989 Astro van which Consumer Reports had rated very poorly, I had only one minor problem in the 9 years, 120,000 miles I owned it.  

The 2001 Astro LT is a dream, it rides smoothly, the gas milage is better than the 89.  Its not too big, my wife feels comfortable driving it.  All the seats recline so my children are comfortable on trips.

The roominess is unbelievable, I have large children and there is room enough for them and a couple of friends and luggage and.......... way beyond any other minivan.  Take the seats out and shazam a 4 X 8 sheet of ply wood or other panel will fit in the back.  Try that in any other minivan.

Thank you General Motors for thinking about families.
