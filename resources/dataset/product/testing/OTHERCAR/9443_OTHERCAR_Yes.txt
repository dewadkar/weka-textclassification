            Not my favorite look of all cars. I would prefer more of a sleek sportscar look than a luxury convertible. It is a good car though. For people who do like the looks of these, you may not be getting all your money's worth, but your getting a fast powerful car.

Driving in this car I was satisfied with the turning and speed it would get. The V8 could get me 0-60 in just a few seconds. I don't think I ever got up to it's max speed, but it did go fast for it's type. With the 6.75 liter engine giving it 420bhp's, you don't have to worry about chugging up a hill.

The top works well too, it can go up and down without a problem. There wasn't a whole lot of room for your feet, but if you want a lot of room buy an SUV. The gas mileage seemed to be average. I always prefer to give these cars $200 20 inch rims for their best look. This is pretty much a rich person car. So if you do decide to invest in it, make sure money isn't going to be a problem.

The troubles with this car are few. It only had about 50,000 miles on it, and my friend has only owned it for a few years, but he said he has a problem with the breaks once in a while. They appear to be on sometimes when he is driving. I did realize he breaks kind of late at stoplights, so the breaks are getting worn down fast. I still think they shouldn't be going out already though. That seems to be the only problem so far.

Overall, if your interested in buying this car, think it through. Remember that once you've driven it off the lot it's used. I do think it can satisfy your need for a fast luxurious car. Buy at your own risk.<br><br>
