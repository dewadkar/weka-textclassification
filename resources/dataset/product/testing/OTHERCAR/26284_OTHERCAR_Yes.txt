                 I recently purchased a 2000 Honda civic Si and I have to say that this is a wonderful compact car for it's price! The Civic Si comes with all the extras at no extra cost. The extras include a sun/moonroof, leather wraped shift knob and steering wheel, a/c, 6 speaker sound system, cruise control and much much more! Although the Civic Si may not be suitable for everyone since it only comes in as a five speed manual transmission. And while it does not have ABS (anti-lock braking system)yet it does have all wheel disks. The Civic Si is available in only three colors in the U.S....black, red and a blue which has a purple tint to it. I bought the blue one :) 
     AS far as the engine well it speaks for itself! A dohc v-tec 1.6L engine, better known as the b16a engine which has a lot of potential for upgrading. The Si also comes stock with a front struct bar which is another nice little bonus :) 
     I recommend this car to a market of those drivers that want excitement with little cost. But since the Civic Si is far from luxury, if you want leather seats....well you are out of luck because it is not an option.
