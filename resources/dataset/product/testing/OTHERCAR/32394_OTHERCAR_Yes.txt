            �. the second thing that I love about Deb is her 1999 Honda Civic.  This sexy little unit has a few things going for it that make the car a pleasure to look at- and a heckova lot of fun to drive.  Looks to me like the Honda people managed to get it all together:  good looks, comfort, great mileage, and the kind of performance that makes you look forward to long trips!  Being a surfer, I know about a good ride- and being from Texas, Deb knows about long trips.

...Speaking of which, are not unusual with Deb. So passenger comfort is critical.  The reason is due to the fact that Deb�s sense of navigation and direction is not quite as developed as, well�, most other people.  So, when Deb says we are going �somewhere�, and she �thinks� she knows where it is, that�s a clue for me to hunker down in those comfy Honda seats and catch a few z�s.  Just last week  we headed out mid-morning to a local eatery �only fifteen minutes from here� to watch her beloved Cowboys play the early game. We didn�t arrive until half-time of the late game.  Go figure!   The seats in the Honda are extremely comfortable for long naps until the GPS arrives- or �we� learn to use a map.

There are, as you may imagine, instances where I have to forcibly take over the driving.  When I do, I find ejecting Deb from the drivers seat relatively easy due to the wide access of the Civic.  The console design of the dash is clearly laid out and neatly arranged.  Speedometer is in perfect view allowing me a clear line of sight when Deb is pushing the 100 mph envelope prior to her removal as the vehicles operator.  The back seat has lots of room and Deb can be restrained comfortably in the back seat either in an upright or horizontal position, while I take over the driving.

The AM/FM/CD stereo is outstanding! Even some of the cowboy cra-....music she constantly plays starts to sound good.   But when it starts getting old, the power windows, which are standard, operate smoothly in a single push of a button allowing me to chuck those CDs right out the window in a single flip of the wrist!  Like the song says: Out the door cowboy! Bye Bye! (Or in the Texas tongue: bah-bah)  My only problem with the sound system is that the CD player only holds five CDs.  My K-Tel collection of �Every Surf Song Ever Recorded� is 23 CD�s.  That�s harsh on my mellow, dude. 

The roof racks are terrific.  We had to take down Deb�s favorite horse saddle because this is the Hamptons and driving around town with your favorite saddle on the roof is considered gauche. Maybe its cool in Texas, but in the Hamptons people look at you funny..  But I was thrilled to find that my 8-10  Gnarly-Dude twin skag surf board, with the tightest cut-in on any board I�ve ever owned, fits nicely on the racks.  So awesome�so verrrry bodacious!  Got to find that perfect wave.

Deb has put a few touches on the car, like the pen holder to prevent incidents like the time when the state trooper ran out of ink writing her tickets for blowing past him at 95 in a 20 mph zone, and Deb offered him one of her pens.   Wasn�t that a good idea?  Sometimes Deb shouldn�t be so accommodating, don�t you think?  But its ok.  We found an insurance agency/bail bondsman that�s underwriting the car for just a little less then $10k a year.   I also had to post my home as collateral.  Normal drivers shouldn�t have to worry about high insurance rates.  We had no option but to take their DemoDerby Driver policy with the $500 million liability rider.

Yes, I do like this car.  In the hands of a capable driver it can be operated relatively safely.   Smart looks, nice performance in an all around great car.   I think the Deb-mobile is beautiful to look at- especially when its parked.
