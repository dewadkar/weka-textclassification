            I bought my Honda Accord EX 2003 coupe brand new the day after Christmas.  I've been driving it for a month now, so I think I can give a pretty accurate review of it's features.  If you have a tendency to drive too fast, this car may not be for you!  It drives so smooth, you push 80 and it feels like you're going much less than that.  I took it to 100 on the highway yesterday I seriously could not tell I was going that fast.  It takes some getting used to, but I actually consider this to be a positive feature because it's like driving a cloud.  In addition to your standard cruise control buttons, it has controls for volume, preset stations and mode on the steering wheel, which is a feature I've grown dependent on!  I hate driving a car without it.  The back seat, although we haven't used much is not so easy to get in and out of (but this is to be expected... it's a coupe), but once you're there, it's spacious.  The Accord also has lots of storage compartments and a really nifty place for your phone charger in the center console.  It has a sunglass holder in it, too.  Now for a suggestion on improvement.  I recommend that if you buy this car, to get it with leather.  It comes standard on the V6 model and if I could do it all over again, I would go with the V6 just to get leather(by the time you add leather to the 4 cyllander, you may as well buy the V6).  The reason being is that the material is awful on the inside. I have to keep a lint brush in the door pocket just because the amount of lint that collects drives me crazy.  Especially on the center console.  It always looks dirty.  It could be because I went with the ivory interior, but either way, leather would be much easier to deal with. Wool coats, mohair sweaters and anything else that sheds do not mix with this car.  It has also wrinkled where the bottom and the back of the bucket seats connect.    I also recommend that if you want to purchase a spoiler for this car, not to buy it from Honda.  I priced one at Honda for $800 and I ended up getting one that is exactly the same (i promise... I drove my car right up to the Honda dealership to make sure) for only $299 through a car accessories shop.  It has the light in it and everything, which Honda said I would be unable to find anywhere else.  Good luck and happy driving!
