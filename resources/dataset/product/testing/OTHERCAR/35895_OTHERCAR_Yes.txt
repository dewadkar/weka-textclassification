            Once upon a time I saw this purple car in a car lot and even tho I was at that lot for a Prelude I couldn't get my eyes off this purple thing. What it was I did not know, what I did know was that I had to drive it. After a nice 20 minute test drive it had to be mine.  So after some help from financing I got her.  I wont say how much she's going to cost me in the long run but oh well.

I've had the car for a month or so and I have only had one problem. I'll start off with the Con and then get to the pro's.

The car didn't have an alarm, I went to C*** ***y and had one installed. What was supposed to be a 2 hour installation turned into 6. They then somehow made it to where my airbag light wouldnt go off.  All I can say is this, it worked fine before the installation.  So off to the dealer I went. The car is still there hehe. It's  been there for a few days because it wasn't a wiring situation it needed a new control box. 

This is a 1997 Hyundai Tiburon and it is a beauty, the acceleration is wonderful. It handles so well, it sounds so nice. Its borderline comfy, it's not as comfy as perhaps one of those big Chryslers or Pontiacs but it isn't a full size car.  This car was made for two things, looking good and driving fast. I knew that the minute I saw it.  It was someone elses before mine tho. But thats life I mean how many things in life do we get new and never touched? Spouses and houses usually aren't even new. ;)

The backseats are mainly great for groceries, you can even seatbelt them in. I would NOT recommend this car to a family at all tho. You can't expect a sports car to be made for families. It's like buying a ferrai and whining because it's not great for babyseats.  

The acceleration is wonderful on the Tiburon, it's not a lamborghini or anything but for the price it's great. If you switch from normal transmission to power I believe it accelerates even better. The trick is to always drive the car with the overdrive on. If you turn that off it's a bit hesitant on the acceleration. The interior is great, it could have used an extra open/close compartment for cd's or whatnot but oh well. The cupholder is a borderline pain if you smoke tho. Non-smokers wont care but if you smoke you can't use the ashtray and the cupholder at the same time. The cupholder sort of gets in the way.  Hyundai made up for it tho with the way they mounted all of the controls. Everything is really easy to get to which I like.  

The headlights were shocking. Usually the smaller racey cars i've driven had weak high beams but the Tiburons brights can blind you. 

But I'm ranting, in short the power of the car is wonderful the looks are drop dead and it handles like a angel.  I had to drive her home a few nights ago in the pouring rain and I still was going quite fast and I didn't have one issue. I then took it on a roadtrip, a nice 6 hour drive and she handled great. I even stayed comfortable which is a change. 

People think Preludes are so great fixed up but a lil work and a Tiburon can just be even better.<br><br>
