            I recently test drove a Subaru XT with black leather, moonroof and heated seats.  I am in the market for an SUV and had been looking at considerably more expensive varieties (Volvo XC90, Toyota 4Runner, Acura MDX, etc.) and thought I would see what less money could still give me.  The Subaru XT was a very good ride, not just for the money, but in general.

The interior leather was very nice, although I'm not sure if it would hold up as well as the nicer European models.  The heated seats came standard with the premium package as did the moonroof.  And what a huge moonroof it is, extending to the backseat.

I live near some lousy conditioned streets and the Forester suspension took them with a BMW-like rigid absorbency.  Very nice.

Acceleration is excellent and seems in line with the quoted sub-8 second 0-60 times.  Although I'm no expert I could not really sense much turbo lag at all.  I had not driven a turbo 4 cyclinder engine for some time and had forgotten what a great feeling it is.  This coupled with the AWD system and lower center of gravity boxster engine made for a strong package.  

The only complaints I had were in three areas:  (1) You CANNOT get power seats on this car by any means from the dealer (2) the large hood scoop was deemed ugly by some (3) The rear window does not open independent of the door.  Of lesser concern but still a complaint would be that the dash has a fair amount of plastic metallic-looking trim.  Worried about how that would hold up.  Additionally at highway speeds there seemed to be some wind noise, but not so much to be annoying.

Aside from the pluses already mentioned here are a few last minute pluses:
- my research suggests the car would have very good reliability
- the cargo area has a good height to it, important to anyone with large dogs
- Performance, a capable AWD system, moonroof, leather, heated seats...all of this can be had for approximately 24k

Unfortunately, my better half did not find the outer shell of the Forester to meet her stringent requirements (read - hates hood scoops), so I did not purchase this great vehicle.  But I would really suggest taking a long look at the Subaru Forester XT before you spend 10-15k more for something with just 15 additional sq. ft. of storage or for that matter, power seats.
