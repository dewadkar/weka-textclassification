            My husband wanted this 1991 GMC Jimmy.  He calls it his "Red Tank".  He used to spit and polish it to a glassy shine. Still does, but just not as enthusiastically.  We bought it in 1992 and have not really done anything to it except change the oil, battery, brakes etc., until last year.  It now has 268,000 miles on it.  

The problems:
A thief stole it right out of the drive way one day.  My husband was going to the store in our car a few days later and saw his precious stolen Jimmy.  While snatching the guy out of the vehicle, it loosened the stirring wheel.  The stirring wheel wiggled when turned, so we fixed it.

The second thing, is in the past two years we have replaced the battery 2 times, and an alternator.  We again need another battery.  Don't know what is causing the problem, bad batteries or something else.  If it's the vehicle, we have yet to find the problem, but probably will.

A report on TV said these vehicles can turn over easy.  I think about that now every time my husband turns a corner.  We haven't turned over yet.

The children never complained about getting into the back seat.  But---a few months ago my sister and I rode in the back.  Getting in was an experience.  Even when the seat is pushed all the way up, still there is very little room.  What was worse it sets high up off the ground.

It would be nice to have a new one, but my husband will probably drive it until it dies--- and--- that might be forever.
