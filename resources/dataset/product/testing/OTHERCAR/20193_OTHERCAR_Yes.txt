            We went shopping for a medium to low price replacement for our Chevrolet Cavalier Convertible which hadn't quite worked out for us, not quite being sturdy enough for the work that we put our cars through. My wife liked the look of this vehicle, which always helps.

<b>The Requirements...</b>
The primary requirements of the purchase were to satisfy the heavy usage that my wife puts the car through and still be reasonably inexpensive, sturdy, with good space, mileage and it had to be a four door to allow transport of our rather large family when needed. 

The primary usages that this car is used for is as a car for running the five boys to their many and various activities, a shopping basket and also for some courier work that requires high mileage and hard cornering, basically just extremely hard driving.

This model is extremely basic, but after seeing the off center crash test results on '60 minutes' where it compared favorably with much more expensive cars we felt that this car at the price gave a sturdy car for a good price.

<b>The Drive...</b>
The initial test drive this car felt a bit sluggish but I think that this was probably because we were used to driving the sporty Cavalier. It handled well and felt very positive. Since driving on a daily basis we have found that this car has enough pick up to get you into traffic easily and keep you there. The handling is very positive with a good turning circle and very stable through the turns. The seating position is good and the visibility is very good in all directions.

When you get in and drive you definitely feel in control and there are enough adjustment options to get you comfortable. I do me just comfortable, this is a functional car, it isn't built or designed for extreme comfort, it works but you wouldn't want to sleep in it!!

<b>Space...</b>
The space in the car is very good. Our 6 foot 4 inch son has room to get his legs behind the wheel. The space in the back has proven adequate for all ages and sizes. The trunk has a lot of space and the back seat does fold down so the trunk and back cabin space can be combined. Much more room than we expected and all usable. Generally very good.

<b>Sturdy...</b>
We have now put over 16,000 miles on this car in the last 6 months. This is a sturdy car! We have just gone through the first set of factory tires, for the driving that this car goes through that is extremely good. The car has just had its standard 3,000 mile services and we have had no problems at all with the running of this vehicle. The mileage that we get is middle of the range stated that the vehicle got for round town and open road running, very good.

<b>Okay, What's wrong...</b>
Well, with all the good there has to be something bad at this price, right? Well yes there does. The problem that we have had is the paint work. By all the documentation that Chevrolet provide this paint work is new, improved and less likely to scratch. We have only cleaned this car using brushless car washers. We noticed after the first few weeks that there were marks on the doors of the vehicle. We thought that this might have been the odd scratch from brushing against objects. Over time this has gotten worse and we are sure that this is a fault of the paintwork. We have contacted Chevrolet and they are not willing to accept this at this stage, but we are going to persist, this IS a FAULT.

<b>Conclusion...</b>
This is a great starter car or general runabout. If this is what you are looking for in a vehicle I can highly recommend it. It is a workhorse that just keeps on going...
