            The Champ is crowned and the crownee is the Honda CR-V.  For all of you SUV shoppers out there, the CR-V has everything, and it has it all for a good price.  It rides smoothly and feels so roomy inside you could fall asleep in the backseet in 4.5 seconds.  The CR-V beats out all the competition with its fair price, comforting seats, 4-wheel drive, and so many other options its unbelievable.  You can usually even buy packages of add-ons which saves money by a large sum.  This car is the best there is, and theres no doubt.  Want anything added, the kind folks at Honda will hook you up right away, also they have one of the best websites out there with the best customer support.  Go to there site and customize the car and see the options you add, right away, no wait.  It is truly amazing.  WWW.HONDA.COM  Go there, and you will be persuaded into this car.  I  LOVE THIS CAR, but don't just take my word, ask around, you will find that Hondas are thought to be the best of the best when it comes to SUVs.  THANKS HONDA.<br><br>
