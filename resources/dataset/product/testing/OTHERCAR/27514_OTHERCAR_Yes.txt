            We love our jeep. Living at the beach it comes in real handy. It has alot of room in the back for everything. Comes in very handy when we go camping as well.

We don't get the greatest gas mileage but its not to bad. It is a very sturdy car that you can feel comfortable in. Real responsive stearing and breaking. Always good for safety.

We have had only one problem and it was just the water pump. Took it to Jeep and had it done that day. We always get the oil change and other mechanical things done as they suggest.

The seating is very comfortable. With plenty of room for 3 in the back and still alot of room in the far back. Front seats are nice with a console in the middle of the 2 with cup holders.

We have put quite a few miles on our Jeep and we are very please so far with its overall performance. Unfortunately I am not very mechanical so i can't be more specific. Nice stereo to boot.<br><br>
