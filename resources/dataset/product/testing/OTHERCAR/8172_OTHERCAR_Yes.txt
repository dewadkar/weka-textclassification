            I was in the market, actually still am for a near-luxury sedan (under $30k).  Immediately I turned to a long time favorite BMW.  Due to my limited budget as a student, The best I could muster was a base 3 series with just the cold weather/ski package.  That is when a professor suggested that I take a look at Audi.

After browsing the lot on a Sunday (no salesmen in sight) I realized it might be harder than I thought to find the car I wanted.  I came back the next day and found that the salesmen weren't as pushy as expected -- a good sign.  The showed respect for me, even knowing I was a college student.  Mark, the salesman, nonchalantly tossed me the keys to the only 5 speed on the lot, save for the orgasmic S4.

The A4, the 1.8T model, drove spectacularly.  I live in snow country, and this vehicle was fitted with the much praised QUATTRO system.  The system was seamless in its operation.  It would be well worth the added weight and expense for some drivers, but not me.  What almost sealed the deal was the long list of standard features.  The power assists, which are standard on most cars in this class were expected, and found -- and pretty logically laid out too.  The A/C (which I did turn on) blew quite strongly.  And as a car designed for cold climate, the heated seats/washers and heated worked as they should.  Fit and finish was actually above that of the 3-series that I also drove.

The price is what was the best aspect of the car.  Although they did not have the configuration that I was looking for in-stock, they had no quamms about ordering it for me.  And the price shocked me.  A 1.8T, with cold weather/ski package, leatherette, and the $1000 &quot;Cool Shades&quot; Yellow, came in, after some dealing to just under $25,000.  The price could have been negotiated even lower, but I did not want to lock myself into something I wasn't sure about.  But until I can find enough for a Volvo S60 T5 or BMW 540i 6-speed, The Audi is probably going to be the next thing that causes me to incur further debt.<br><br>
