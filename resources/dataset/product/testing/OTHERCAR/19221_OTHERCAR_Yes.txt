            What do you look for in a digital camera?  After purchasing one for myself, one for my parents, and now using my girlfriend's, I think I have developed a pretty good idea of what you should look for in a digital camera.  

What do I look for in a digital camera?  I am interested in the following qualities in no particular order:

1.  Quality of the photo
2.  Price
3.  Size
4.  Ease of use
5.  Customer service
6.  Name brand
7.  Computer compatibility

Which of the above matters the most?  I really cannot say since I look at the product as more of a blend.  However, in order to even receive consideration, the camera must rank rather highly in five of the six categories I listed above.  Wait, hwz1.  I see seven categories listed.  I know, but the unknown is customer service and that you will not know about until you need them.  However, you can get an idea about customer service by calling and asking general questions.  If they know the answers, then you are in decent hands.  If not, well...  Also, see how much time you spend on hold and you will get some idea of how many people have trouble with the product (Lets face it, you do not call customer service to tell them about a product that works flawlessly).

I know, the listed statistics and information above really does not mean much at this point.  I will explain most of it in a moment.

QUALITY OF PHOTO:

The Dimage 2300 takes the best digital photo that I have seen.  I have three photos from the camera are framed and prominently displayed in my apartment and everyone comments how they cannot believe that they are digital images.  Yes, they are and yes they look professional.

One drawback to any digital photo is the metallic looking border that can form around dark colors.  Yes, you will still see it, but only in a certain light.  Simply arrange the photo in a manner that does not catch the light and you will never see the outline.  Far and away the best print copy of a digital photo that I have seen.

Additionally, the photo appears on your screen after you take it.  Hence, you can decide to save it or delete it.  If you save it, you will use a little bit of memory and can then can print the photo and delete it or transfer it to hard drive. If you do not like the photo you can delete it and take another.  Easy as can be.

PRICE:

When dealing with a digital camera you know that you are going to spend a decent amount of cash.  I find a rule of thumb is that it is best to spend a few extra bucks for the performance that will hopefully accompany those dollars.  

The Minolta Dimage 2300 is not cheap, but when you consider the options and the quality you will find that the camera is cheap when compared to other cameras that offer much less.  

SIZE:

Does size really matter?  Of course it does, silly.  One of the best features of the 2300 is the compact size of the camera.  Are we talking disposable camera size?  No, but we are talking about a camera that is slightly smaller than many traditional cameras.  I find that it will fit in a jacket pocket or a jeans pocket.  Yes, it fits into a purse with ease.  Additionally, the camera is lightweight and will not weigh you down when you are chasing that UFO you swear is out there.

EASE OF USE:

Most digital cameras take a while to get accustomed to, but the 2300 is quite easy to use.  I may not be the best person to speak of ease of use for a beginner, but for most people, after a few uses, you will find that the 2300 is a snap and works much like a traditional camera.  The main differences are the typical differences you find with digital cameras.  Be sure to read the user's guide before first using the camera and then after a few uses I think you will find it to be easy to use.  I do find the timer option to be a little difficult to use, but who doesn't on any camera?

CUSTOMER SERVICE:

I have not used customer service, but my technologically challenged girlfriend has.  From what I gathered, the service was professional, polite, and did not involve too long of a wait.  Additionally, they figured out her problems and saved me from doing the work.  Kudos!

NAME BRAND:

I always think it is important to buy an expensive product from a company that is known.  Would you buy a camera from a company called &quot;Leximam&quot;?  Yeah, me neither and they do not exist so do not bother looking for their products.  I think it is key to find a company that is tried and true.  A company that has been through a few wars and will be around five years from now when a problem may creep up.  Minolta has been around for as long as most of us can remember and will likely still be around when my children reach my age (Could be 50 years from now).

COMPUTER COMPATIBILITY:

How easily does your computer hook up with the camera and then how easy is it to use the software?  Ah, a good question since you will be doing most of your printing from your computer.  The 2300 hooks up as easily as can be- a cord running from camera to hard drive.  Then all you do is turn on the camera and go to your Adobe software and pick the feature you wish to use.  

The photoshop features include printing, corrections (Removing red eye, clipping, touching up), and numerous other functions that you may find useful.  I find the software is easy to use and it only takes a moment to download.

WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE 2300:

What have I found that is not a positive?  Not much, actually.  I find the battery life to be limited, but I think that is more a general problem with digital cameras.  In other words, most digital cameras seem to take a lot of the life from the batteries in a short period of time.

I also find that the mettallic colored background is evident in many digital photos.  Yes, it is evident with the 2300, but not as evident as with many other digital cameras.  As I said, if you arranged the photo correctly, you will never know it exists and neither will anyone else. Try as I might, these are the only negatives that I can find.


TELL ME MORE:

Ah, there is not a lot more to tell.  I would suggest taking a look at the 2300 and you will see what I mean.  It is a rarity that you will find small size and the quality bundled into one digital camera.  The Minolta Dimage 2300 combines both and also contains much more.  I would highly recommend the 2300 to anyone who is looking for a digital camera.
