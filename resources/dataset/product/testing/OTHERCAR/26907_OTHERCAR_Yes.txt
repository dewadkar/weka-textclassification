            I bought this 1991 Toyota Camry because I was in desperate need of a car with 4 doors. I'm a Toyota girl anyway, so this Camry was an easy choice for me. Though it had 50,000 more miles than the Tercel I traded in on it, and it's a year older, I HAVE HAD SO MUCH FUN IN THIS CAR!!!
It has major power (this is the first automatic transmission car I've ever owned, and it has this little button, so if you're trying to pass someone on a hill, it gives you a little &quot;power boost.&quot; It also has cruise control, power windows, power sunroof and an air horn (all of which I've never had on a car before).  Of course, it takes more gas to fill it up than did my Tercel, but it's getting great gas mileage. 
You can tell by looking at the car that the sunroof/moonroof has never leaked, the trunk doesn't leak, everything works on the car and the car sounds like a brand new car.
