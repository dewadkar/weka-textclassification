            After much research, I bought this camera to upgrade from my entry level Kodak 215. I was going to get a 3 megapixal one, but really wanted the 10 optical zoom. Am I glad that I got the Olympus!!!!

First I cannot emphamisize enough that optical zoom is the only way to go. On top of that, this camera has image stabilization that makes hand held shots very clear. Even at full zoom, you don't see my shakey hands. This camera is full of features that allow you to make many of the settings yourself or just be set on automatic. The 2 megapixal resolution is fine for up to 8X10. The limiting factor for me is my printer, not the camera. 

Another nice feature about this camera is that accessories are easy (and relatively) cheap to add. It uses a standard 49mm thread mount on the lense for mounting filters and add-on lenses. There are external jacks for microphones and flashes. You can trick this camera up as much as you can afford and create some great photos.

Some people have commented that it is hard to learn to use, but I am finding that the controls are pretty intuitive. Yes, it make take a few weeks to realize all the features you have, but after you use them once, it is easy to remember. One feature I found neat was the panarama shots. The movie mode is about what you would expect, but still quite adaquate (it's not a digital video camera, remember).

One thing about this set, you get most everything you need in the box. Instead of just alkaline batteries like some, you get the high capacity ones and a charger. The main drawback is the media card. 8 meg is silly when cards are so cheap, but this is not enough to keep you from buying this camera. 

All in all, you can tell I just love this thing. I am taking pictures of sunsets I never could get before. I like it better than my Nikon SLR. It handles indoor shots without a flash if I want and too much more to tell. The rumor is that Olympus is phasing this one out. Its a shame, because I think they have a winner here. CompUSA is running promos on this with upgraded media cards for $499.
