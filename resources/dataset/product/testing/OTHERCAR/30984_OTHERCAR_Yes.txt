            I have had a firebird for the past year and a half.  Durring that time I have been honked at, winked at, stared at, and never laughed at.  What a great automobile.  Aside from the normal defects american cars have like bad accessories and cheep interior, the car preforms wonderfuly.  I have a 5-speed manual (the only thing a real american would ever buy) and I smoke mustangs off the line.  Plus unlike the mustang, you can sit in the back seat even if you arnt a midget.  The bucket seats make it fairly comfortable as well.  If you are looking for a LOT of car without hitting that higher price range... test drive a firebird you wont regret it.  (I also recommend getting a radar detector with this purchase as you WILL need one).<br><br>
