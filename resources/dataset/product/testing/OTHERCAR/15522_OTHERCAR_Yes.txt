            I had a little car trouble with my latest beater-mobile (an '81 Buick Skylark) recently.  I knew it was pretty bad trouble when the passenger side hit the ground with a deafening thud, and I was passed by the front passenger side tire, which to this very day has managed to conceal it's location.  After getting myself towed and set up with a mechanic, I decided I needed to get myself some wheels until the rust-rocket was out of the shop.
It was a Saturday, and the only place that was open to rent cars that had any left to rent was the Alamo by the airport.  I took a $25 dollar cab ride to the airport to see what they could put together for me.  It turns out they had just the thing I needed after a tough weekend.
I could have gotten a little economy car for around fifty bucks, but I wanted to cut loose and have a good time (I had just gotten my tax return), so I decided for something a bit sportier.  I asked the rental clerk if he had any convertibles left, and a little over $100 on my card later, I was setting behind the wheel of a fully loaded Sebring.
The first thing I did was put down the top (hey, I live in Florida).  It was a lot easier than the convertible tops I had used in the past.  All I had to do was unbuckle two clips and hit a button, and down came the roof.  I liked the fact that when the top was up, the Sebring had a glass window, instead of one of those cruddy little plastic deals you can never see out of.
The seats were a beautiful, black leather.  They were very comfortable, and the fact that they were power seats didn't hurt any either.  I like to play with buttons.  It had cruise (I love cruise control), A/C (like a convertible really needs it, but hey, humid days, you know?), and your standard AM/FM Stereo Cassette sound system.  I also liked the digital dash readouts, which were easy to see even when the sun glared on them.
After strapping in and hitting the interstate, I discovered that the Sebring had a lot of pick-up-and-go.  I put my foot into the gas (who doesn't when they have a new plaything) and merged into interstate traffic with an ease I hadn't experienced since I had to give up my Infiniti.  I knew I'd hate taking the car back right then.
I went cruising down by the beach, and noticed that this car was a head turner.  Of course, it could have just been me everyone was looking at (I am a handsome man).  I would have stopped and talked to all the girls that were waving, but you know what they say about girls who are interesting in you for your possessions (besides the fact that they're a lot of fun).
If you're the sort of person who wants a convertible, but at the same time needs an &quot;adult&quot; car with all the luxuries, you should buy this.  You get many of the benefits of something more sporty, yet you get it with the dignified appearance that you don't find in little red sports cars with rag tops and plastic windows.
I really enjoyed driving this car, but I may have been overly impressed due to my recent ventures into the world of cheap beaters.  I think you should rent before you buy, just to be on the safe side.  Give this one a try.<br><br>
