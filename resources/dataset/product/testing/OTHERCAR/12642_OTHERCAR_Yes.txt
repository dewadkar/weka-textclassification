            The Canon S-10 is perhaps one of the best compact digital cameras out there. Everything about this camera says canon quality. The body, except for the battery and flash storage doors is all around metal. Front plate, top, back plate, lens bezel, all magnesium and aluminum.

The next great thing about this camera is, well the lens and the CCD. Canon gained alot of experience in building small optics with their hit Elph Cameras, it is employed here. While small, the lens is a fast f 2.8 giving you an edge over most digital cameras, as you can better utilize existing light, without having to resort to flash. The CCD, image sensor is bar none. I think it perhaps the best 2.1 megapixel sensor available today. This camera produces great images that unlike on other digital cameras, dont need to be sampled down. They're very low noise, and when printed produce good 8x10"s. I would say that the S-10's practical resolution is on par with most point and shoot APS cameras. Another plus is the Low-Glare Color LCD on the back of the camera. Best of any digital camera I've used, and I use it alot to frame pictures. For the more experienced photographers, the S-10 has some manual controls, Exposure compensation +/- 2 stops in 1/3 increments, Selectable White Balance, Spot Metering (with real time preview through the LCD screen) and Variable ISO 100-400.  It also features USB support and IBM card-compatibility...stores up to 1 GB of photos in this handy little camera.

This camera does use only one 2CW5 lithium batteries, which can get a little pricey, but they last for quite a long time...but still.
