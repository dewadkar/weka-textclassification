            Wow, where to start?  Well, you may or may not remember this, but I did an epinion on the Cutlass Calais a little while back.  I thought that car had one of the weakest engines I have ever driven.  Well, this car completely showed it up.  It makes the 4 cylinder calais seem like it was a drag racer.  This car, like the Calais, is also my sisters.  She wrecked the Calais, and the Protege was all that she could afford.  This was just the second time that a family member of mine did not buy an American car.  

Now that you have a little bit of background, let me begin to describe the car.  Well, it has a small four cylinder engine.  Its front wheel drive.  It gets decent fuel mileage.  It has cloth seats, which feel like sitting on a milk crate.  It has an AM\FM cassette and not too good of sound quality out of the speakers.  Well those are the main things, now let me hit on some other stuff more in depth.

Well, lets start with the engine.  A very small four cylinder car.  The RPM's often hit in the high fives and sixes.  It is pretty scary when you have to almost redline a car to get up a hill.  Acceleration is missing from this car, I'm not sure if it was ever in the car or if six years of driving has killed it, but I accelerate faster than it walking. 

The transmission is about to go, when shifting gears it kinda jerks the car around.  This happened to a friend of mine's mustang and a few months later, he lost his transmission.  I believe this will soon happen with the car, and that it is only a matter of time.  I almost feel that they rushed this car onto the assembly line without thinking through it.

Ah, moving along to the exhaust system.  It doesn't put out too many polutants, but it has rusted awfully fast for only 6 years of living in North Carolina.  I am not quite sure how this happened, but the entire exhaust system is rust.

Handling is alright, kinda poor when cornering sharply.  If you let go of the wheel on the highway it veers to the right just a little, no matter what side of the road you are on.

Moving along to the interior.  For starters, the color of the interior kinda looks like the color of vomit, so that is not a good start.  The seats however wouldn't have even been considered comfortable during the cave man days.  I am not sure if she test drove this before buying it, because the seats are rock hard, and I can barely fit in the seat length-wise (I'm only 5'11").  Definately not meant for the taller man.  The rest of the interior is just kinda a cheap plastic looking interior, nothing too out of the ordinary.

Overall, I do not recommend this car to anyone who can afford something else.  This car has been nothing but trouble, and she has only had it for 4 months, she has been giving it back to the guy who sold it to her three times now, he does a little something and says its fixed.  I think the car is done for.  It sounds like it is about to die and I am a little worried for her safety in the car.  In summary, do not buy this car, unless you enjoy leg cramps and headaches.  Thanks for reading my epinion, I hope that it helped.
