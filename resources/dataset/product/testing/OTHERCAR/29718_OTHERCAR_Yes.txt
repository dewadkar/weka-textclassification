            I inherited a 90 Mazda Miata when I was in high school, and while a fun, sporty car, I really needed something with a little more room.  My first intention was to get an SUV, but the deal fell through and that's when I began looking at sedans.  I knew that I wanted a car that was both nice and sporty.  However, these cars in my price range were very hard to find.  I finally stumbled upon the Acura Vigor, a car which I had little knowledge of other than that it was one of the few cars that fit my criteria and my budget.  I began to do some research on the car, and found that it had a very good record, and was one of the more highly recommended used cars of the 92 year.  So, after much searching, I finally found a Vigor that suited my needs and was affordable.  I was lucky to find an Acura salesman who had paid less for the car in the beginning, and was therefore selling the car at a great deal cheaper than the other used Vigors on the market.  So, I came to buy my 92 Vigor in the Fall of 94, and have been extremely pleased with this car ever since.  

I know that it probably shouldn't be, but my main concern when choosing a car is usually going to be the looks of the vehicle.  The Acura Vigor, while not that unique, is certainly a stylish vehicle.  As far as sedans of that year go, the Vigor is mush more sporty looking than most.  The one I purchased had a spoiler, which I think adds a great deal to this car.  Without the spoiler, the Vigor looks pretty plain and boring. However, the spoiler adds the sportiness that this car so greatly needed.  The front of the car is also quite sporty looking, as the front of the car is very similar to a Legend in many regards.  Other little details make this car very aesthetically pleasing.  The door handles that fit nicely into the door, the lines of the car, and the forward design, are all bonuses that make the design of this car look very nice.  I sometimes get the feel that this car is sort of plain looking, and while it probably is, it gives the car a more traditional look which is so rarely seen in cars of today.

The inside of the car is also very nice.  The leather seats are very comfortable and make for a very easy, and enjoyable ride.  And with proper care, my leather has held up very well over the years with the exception of a few scratches which are going to be found on almost any 9 year old car.  The factory sound system is great, and while I did replace the speakers, I have kept the factory system in the car.  A built in CD player in the trunk completes the system, which is already superb.  The dash is done very nicely, with a highly visible display which doesn't come across as tacky.  Oftentimes, cars make up for high vision displays with gaudy lights, but the Vigor has none of this.  The wood grain in the car is also beautiful, and has maintained its superb shine even though the car is almost 9 years old now.  Power seats, windows, and locks all make for very easy movement within the car.  Rounding all of this out is a power sunroof which is great for those cool fall days.  However, the base stereo system has always been one of my favorite features.   It lets you choose from a wide variety of ways to listen to your music, from club and classical, to hall or den settings with varying levels of echo among them.  

Now, my favorite feature on this car, the manual shift, is not present on very many Vigors.  This was my main concern when buying the car.  I like being able to have the power of a stick underneath me and cannot stand the mushy feel of automatics.  With the manual transmission on this car, you can really take this car to its limit.  The shifting is extremely easy, and lets you combine all the features of a luxury car with the feel of a sports car.  And while expensive to replace, (around $900) my clutch lasted until 120K miles which was a total surprise for me.  I'll pay that extra $900 every 120K miles any day, if it means I get the extra power of a manual transmission.  

The feature most unique to the Vigor, however, is the engine which is an Inline-5.  Very, very few cars are made with this engine, which is a great middle ground among 4 and 6 cylinder cars.  The one drawback to this engine is that parts for it are not common, and any time one of them has to be replaced, it is quite a hefty expense.  The engine provides plenty of power for my needs, and with the addition of the manual transmission, it can take a lot of cars off the line that have even bigger engines.  Not that I would recommend it, but I was very surprised to see that this car could get up to 125 mph.  It might be able to pull even more, but I'll leave that test for someone else.  But if driving fast is what you like, the Vigor certainly feeds the need for speed, which is not often seen on the bigger luxury cars.  The brakes have always seemed a little mushy to me, so watch out if you have to make any high speed stops.  However, they are rarely needed on the highway as this car hugs turns very well, which can also be attributed to the fact that it is quite low to the ground.

Some other random features make this car a wonderful choice.  I have always found that this car gets very good gas mileage, and with today's rising gas prices this is certainly a bonus.  Also, the ride of this car is extremely smooth.  Many times I have had other riders in the car comment on how smooth the car rides.  Trunk space is more than adequate on the Vigor, and will easily hold enough luggage for a 4-person road trip.  This car is extremely luxurious and has many features and designs which are often only found on much higher priced cars.  Fog lights, even though they are rarely needed, are standard on the Vigor and add a nice touch to the frontal design of the car.  The factory spoiler also comes with a  row of brake lights on it which are very attractive.

Of course, the main feature of any car is how well it stands up under today's driving conditions.  And let me be the first to say, that if this car can handle my driving without skipping a beat, then it is certainly doing a wonderful job.  My Vigor has been relatively free of problems, and takes little care other than regular oil changes.  The only repairs that I have had to make are the clutch and replacing the brakes.  The stereo display light does tend to blink on and off sometimes, which can probably be attributed to a loose wire, but is really nothing more than a minor annoyance.  Other than this, there have been absolutely no major problems with this car.  Acura really did a wonderful job with this car in that, after 9 years, it still runs almost as well as it did the day I bought it.  Nothing has broken, fallen off, or come apart, and this is certainly what we all strive to find in a car.  

There are however, a few minor problems with the Vigor.  The most annoying problem I have had with the car is wind noise coming from the side view mirrors.  When driving in excess of 70 mph, the air blowing through these mirrors virtually howls.  With normal city driving, it is rarely noticed, but on longer trips it can certainly become a nuisance.  One thing that I cannot believe is lacking on this car, are cup holders.  Who would think, that with all the other standard features on the Vigor, that there would be no cup holders?  This is certainly a problem when trying to shift gears and hold a drink at the same time.  Another problem, which I have heard from others, is that the back seats are tiny.  Big enough for only a very small person, these seats are nowhere near big enough for full size adults, especially when traveling.  With the small seats also comes very little leg room in the back.  For only 2 people, this is fine, but could become a problem for larger families.  My last major gripe with this car is the air conditioning.  I've had all kinds of maintenance done on it, but it just will not cool the car down in very hot conditions.   Only after an hour or so of driving does the car feel like it is cooling down.  But, I do a lot of driving with the windows down so this has never been a major issue for me, but only for those who ride with me.   And while not a problem, the fact that the back windows roll down crooked, often calls for me to answer a lot of questions about why they do what they do. 

These minor drawbacks do little, however, to take away from the overall charm of this car.  If I had it to do all over again, I can't think of a car that I would have rather had.  And while many cars from the early 90s look outdated, the Vigor still looks like a fairly modern car.  Virtually maintenance free, the Vigor will fit in fine to almost anyone's budget.  However, since the car is older and has a unique engine, parts are very expensive if they do have to be replaced.  Acura did a wonderful job with the Vigor in every area from the styling to the feel of this car.  Few details are left out, and the Vigor wonderfully combines luxury with sport.  While highly recommended with an manual transmission, this car is certainly a wonderful car without it.  Almost 9 years old now, and virtually problem free.  I doubt seriously that very few cars on the market would perform that well.  And one final advantage: The Vigor was made before Acura decided to revamp their entire car line into a boring fleet of no personality cars, with the exception of the NSX.  Acura had a wonderful car in the Vigor and it's too bad that the life span of this car was cut so short.  However, every other feature of this car makes it a wonderful choice for someone looking to buy a great used car, without the hefty price tag.<br><br>
