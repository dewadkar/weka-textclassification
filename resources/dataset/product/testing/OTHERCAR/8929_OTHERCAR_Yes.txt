            Dodge Grand Caravan 98--One of the most popular minivans around and with good reason.  The van is big and roomy and seats seven people.  The front and the middle seats are quite comfortable, but trying to get into the back seats of the van takes a lot of agility.  The bench seat in the middle was a lot easier to maneuver around than the bucket seats.  Storage is ample with lots of compartments and most of the cup holders come in handy.  There is plenty of room behind the third seat for luggage, baby strollers or the kids bikes.  The air conditioning controls in the back are adequate, however they are located over the passengers heads on the sides and a little inconvenient.  Gas mileage is good, getting about 22mpg in town and about 28 mpg on the highway.  The ride is smooth and consistent and the V6 engine was peppy.  Overall, this is a good family minivan.<br><br>
