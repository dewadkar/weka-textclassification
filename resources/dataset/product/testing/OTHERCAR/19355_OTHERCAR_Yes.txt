            Most of my life, I've driven mid size or sports type cars. I never had a mini van, but we decided we needed MORE ROOM to take friends and family with us, places, instead of caravans of cars that get lost. We bought our 1994 Chevrolet Lumina Mini-van in April, 2,000. It is turquoise, loaded, beautiful, drives SO SMOOTHLY. We love the wrap-around windshield. We can see so much of the country side when on trips! Shopping is easier now. It holds so many things, PLUS people and pets, too! Good on gas! Easy to drive! The only problem has been the seat belts and we're hoping to make contact with the manufacturer about this problem and see if the seat belts can be replaced. It seems to be an engineering flaw, at the time these mini vans were built. Anyone have suggestions about who to contact and if they will replace the seat belts for free or is there a cost we can expect???? Seat belts are THE LAW and safety concern. The belts seem too short and twist and get tangled easily, a hassle. That is the ONLY complaint, but otherwise, this was a great purchase and decision!
Thanks, Jan &amp; Dee Hendrixson, Ft. Worth, Texas 

PS: We're grandparents now and feel this is a great vehicle for just about anyone from young people, couples, young families, and grand parents that take more trips to see their kids and grandkids. It's a great vehicle for shopping, trips, hauling family and friends, plus room for pets. It is a roomy feeling, a safe feeling, too. Very comfy!!!!
We recommend this vehicle HIGHLY and have heard other positive comments about the Lumina Mini Van!!! We also got a very good deal on it! :)<br><br>
