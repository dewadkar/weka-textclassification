            The Toyota 4-Runner is an amazing SUV.  It has a smooth, comfortable ride and is most importantly...safe!  The 4-Runner has been named one of the safest SUV's and one of the least likely to roll.  I bought this car because it looks really nice, and it is fun to drive.  I like sitting high up so you can see everything that is going on up ahead of you.  The engine is suprisingly quiet as compared to other SUV's that I have been in.  This car also attracts attention(because of its good looks).  It is one of the largest SUV's and that extra size is shown through the large size of the trunk area.  The middle seats also fold down for those times when you need extra room.  Another added feature is a cover for the trunk area so when you want, you can cover stuff up so people cannot look through your windows and see what you have back there.  This is a great car overall, I have had no major problems with it, and I recommend it to anyone in the market for an SUV.<br><br>
