            Before I go any further, I'll let you know right now that I really like this camera, but as with any product, there are a few things I would change. Also, the customer service at Kodak is HORRIBLE.

I think the camera takes really good quality pictures. The colors are very bright, and the images are sharp. It has three different image quality settings, and also allows you to choose between megapixel resolution and 640 x 480 resolution. The second option is especially good because sometimes you don't want huge screen-filling pictures that the megapixel setting records, so you can take the picture at the lower resolution. This option is especially good when designing websites.

With the quality set to the highest, and the resolution in megapixel mode, the camera takes about 25 pictures with the 8 mb Compact Flash card that is included. But another payoff of the 640 x 480 setting is that when set at this resolution at highest quality mode, the camera can literally take about 60 pictures on the 8 mb card. I think that's awesome. I ended up buying another 8 mb card, and with just the two cards I had more than enough space to take pictures on my first trip to New York City earlier this month.

The user interface is another really good feature of the camera. The on-screen menu options are really easy to understand and are in a really user-friendly font type. 

Ok, here are some pet peeves about the camera:

- It eats batteries like no other. I've found that the rate that the camera uses batteries (4 AA's) is amazing. I bought some rechargeable batteries and a recharger and that solved my problem.

- The camera is pretty hefty. It's a lot heavier than my last camera, and has kind of a bulky shape. It won't fit easily into your pocket. 

- The rubber covers covering the AC adapter connection, the transfer cable connection, and the output connection at the side of the camera are kind of cheap-feeling and flimsy.

- The time it takes to transfer pictures is really slow. A lot slower than my first camera.

The absolute worst problem with the camera, something Kodak REALLY needs to work on is it's phone based support. It is HORRIBLE. I really cannot stress how negative my experience in this area has been. My AC adapter broke, and I called to send it in to be repaired under warranty. The MINIMUM waiting time any time I called was 15 minutes. I sent the camera to Kodak, but instead of coming back in 7-10 days like they said, it arrived 3 weeks later. But to make things worse, the first time I used the adapter, I found that they had not fixed the problem. I had to call back repeatedly, one time being put on hold for OVER AN HOUR. The reps are nice, but the waiting time is horrible and I'm really mad that I have to go through the hassle again since they didn't fix it the first time.

Ok, that's pretty much the end of my commentary on the camera. Overall, I'd say it's really good camera, a 4for sure, but get's downgraded to a 3
because of my horrible experience on hold for hours upon hours with Kodak. 

If you'd like to read on, it's just the story of how I got the camera and it compared to my last one. 

The DC 210 plus zoom is my second digital camera. My first was a Pretec brand camera that my mom bought me off of AOL before I went to college. It was a 640 x 480 pixel camera that had no zoom. That was a good first camera, but after a while I really wanted a zoom lens and better quality pictures. (That first camera cost about $225 I think.)

I began looking around for a camera that had a zoom lens, megapixel ability, and good quality pictures. I literally spent hours browsing different websites trying to decide which to buy. I visited about every different site that had reviews of cameras and comparison tests of digital cameras. For the money, it seemed that the Kodak was the best bet.

I didn't buy the camera out of any retail store, but instead I bought it on Ebay from a camera shop in Washington for $266, including shipping. This was a great price. I bought it and ended up giving my old one to my brother. My first camera was a great one, but the pictures on the Kodak are a lot better.
