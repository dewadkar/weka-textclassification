            The Toyota Corolla is one of the few affordable compact cars that is dependable.  Let's face it if you want a car that is dependable you have to fork over some bucks.  The Corolla cost around $15,000 and the dependability of this car is immeasurable.  For the first time car buyer you can't go wrong with the Corolla.  I was skeptical at first about the car but once I brought it home it has been clear sailing.  The maintenance of the car is non-existence, you take it to get the oil changed every 3000 miles and you never worry about anything else.  All right you say it is a bit staid in it's look, but I would rather have a reliable car that starts every morning then buy a car for it's aesthetic values and pay over-blown prices.  I recommend this car to teenagers, young families just getting started, and people generally looking for a good value for their monies.  Toyota Corporation, you just cannot find a more dependable automobile maker today.<br><br>
