            Well to start things off...I knew virtually nothing about digital cameras when I started looking.  Then I started examining the Nikon Coolpix 900 series (since I kept hearing great things about it).  After looking at it and playing with it in a camera store for a about an hour, I decided that that was not the camera for me.  I shunned away from the Sony because of the Memory stick (I had an Ipaq and a CF card that I wanted to use with the camera).  After thinking about sharing the CF card with the camera, I decided that this was probably not a good thing.  So I took another look at the Sony.
First Impressions were disbelief and confusion.  After playing with it a little in the store, my disbelief turned into WOW, what a camera.  I had had 35mm cameras and just bought one before going on a vacation to Mexico but I wished I had looked at this one prior to buying.
The Lens is excellent and the autofocus is quick for me, although if your taking action shots, you may need to be ready in advance as this camera does not have a &quot;rapid&quot; shot feature (or least I haven't found it yet).  The built in retractable flash is great for me although the red eye reduction feature I think I still need to play with a little more (doesn't completely get rid of red eye).
The supplied memory stick (8 meg) was virtually useless.  I immediately went out and bought a 64Meg stick.  That solved that problem right away.  The 8 meg stick will only allow a few high resolution shots.  Now waiting for Sony to come out with a 128+ stick.
The battery hasn't caused me any problems yet but I will probably get another to be safe, although I will probably wait for Sony to come out with a 2 hour battery instead of the 1 hour battery as supplied.
One issue I had was when taking a photo of someone in the house under dark conditions, it was almost impossible to locate the person in the view finder (you eventually get use to this and learn new ways of counter acting this issue).
The one thing that drew me to the Sony camera was the fact that if I wanted to go full Automatic, it could, or if I wanted control over the camera, it could do that equally as well.  I typically like the camera to do most of the work, but being a tech head, eventually, I will start experimenting with the manual features (which are plenty).
Overall, the photos are fantastic.  I didn't realize that Sony could make such a great camera.  I own a lot of Sony products but never really considered photo equipment until now.
I loved the camera so much, I bought one for my department at work (we needed a digital camera for business purposes)<br><br>
