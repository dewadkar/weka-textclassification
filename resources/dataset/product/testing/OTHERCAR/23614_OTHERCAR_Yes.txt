            I bought this vehicle because of the room it offers.  I have a family that  consists of 5 people and it has fit everyone comfortably.  I love this car because it has power and it is a real comfortable ride.  I feel so free and happy when I drive this car.  The thing that I hate about  this vehicle is that I've already had to put in a transmission.  The cost for this would have been 1600 dollars if they didn't offer me the 70,000 mile warranty that was in my owners manual but I heard they (dealers) don't honor this warranty anymore.  People with families should buy this car because they will find that this car will  satisfy all their needs.   I think that everyone should have the chance to drive or own on of these cars.   <br><br>
