            In late '95 I was ready for my first new car purchase.  I liked the versatility of SUV's, so I looked at several different models.  I ended up with the Chevy Blazer because of several reasons:  Ride quality, Engine quality, and price.  Knowing that SUV's get horrible gas mileage,  I was content with the V-6.  It gives you a few more MPG than a V-8.  Also, the 4.3L Vortec has very good power.  Towing is not a problem with this SUV.  I purchase all options except for leather seats  and the towing package.  I also got the optional 235/75R15 Goodyear Wrangler RT/S tires,  the 3.73 rear axle with locking differential and the touring suspension package.  The car was manufactured at the Moraine, Ohio plant.

I currently have 68,000 miles on the truck and the only problems I've had are very small in number.  I just purchased new tires after getting 67,000 on the original tires.  I also just had new lower ball joints installed;  the new model Blazers are known for ball joints going bad.  Other than that the car runs great.  No rattles or squeaks, a very solid car.  The ride is very car like.  Nice tight steering that holds a straight line nicely.  If you looking for a truck like ride to handle more rugged terrain, look at the special ZR2 off-road package.  As long as you do regular maintenance (rotate tires, oil change, differential fluid, serpentine belt, etc...),  these SUV's will just keep going.  The finish still looks great, except for the expected paint chips.  There are no rust spots at all.

I get 19 MPG consistently in city driving and around 24 MPG on the highway.  Don't expect great gas mileage on a SUV that weighs over 4,000 pounds.

All in all, I am extremely happy with my '96 Blazer and can easily recommend this SUV to anyone who is looking for a reliable, solid, and relatively inexpensive (as 4-Door 4x4 SUV's go), SUV.  Just don't expect great gas mileage.

Update:  Just want to let you know I still feel the same about this truck.  I currently have 90,000 miles and It's still running great.  No major repairs since the ball joints where replaced.
