            This purchase was an upgrade from the Agfa ePhoto 1280 (read my review on it) a very nice camera that served me well.  The Agfa like all the other digitals uses a Smart Media Card and AA batteries which die fast no matter how good the rechargeables are...a royal pain in the butt.

The Sony RULES!  The LCD viewer is large.  The floppy system is the best possible media short of a mini disc which probably wont be available for 3-5 years.  A child can use this camera and load the pictures into the computer.  THERE IS NO BETTER DIGITAL MEDIA THAN THE SONY FLOPPY SETUP.

The battery is POWERFUL and maintains a 2 hour plus charge.  I bought a second battery which is also an upgrade and it holds a charge for 3 plus hours...and they charge fast.  This camera is 5 times the quality of the Agfa.  Agfa took 17 seconds between shots...Sony takes 2-4 seconds!  You can make a 15-60 second MPEG movie WITH ONE CLICK!  The mic is built in.  

This camera is great for close ups which was a drawback w/Agfa.  The macro setting goes up to 1&quot; inch from your subject which is close-up enough for anything.  This is just 100% A+ in every way...My one disappointment is I wish I had a better zoom BUT no one has a better one for the money.  The FD-88 which I tried has a GREAT ZOOM and that is the ONLY difference in the 2 cameras.  If you have the $$$ go for the $FD-88, or better yet the FD-91.  No need to go on and on...this is the one for me.  I paid $509 with shipping and $55 for a starter kit with an extra battery (a real good one), case, cleaning kit, and some floppies).  If you cant find a good deal email me and I will direct you.  Thanks for listening.<br><br>
