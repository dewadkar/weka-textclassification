            Welcome,;) this is my review for our 96 cavalier. And to tell you the truth this car has been very loyal to us. I haven't had any major problems with this car.My wife and i purchased this car back in 96 of Febuary, she wanted a purple one that looked perfect for a highschool kid. But instead we went with the one color they call metallic sandrift,it's kinda like a lightgold champaygne color.Perfect for the contempoary adult. The car we bought came with a 2.2 litre manual transmission. two-door. the four door was really not that appealing to me nor my wife. We allready have 99290 miles and the only thing i've replaced is the serpentine belt and a valve cover gasket. I feel that chevy has finally built a product worth standing up to. The interior is appealing plenty of trunk space the sound quality of the stereo is superb with options to conect a cd-disk changer. The gas milage is very good and the driving handles very well. for 13,000 dollars the car is really god for me,and well worth it.
