            I purchased my Year 2000 Volkswagen Jetta TDI a little over a month ago now.

For those who don't know, TDI stands for Turbo Direct Injection - in short, it's the DIESEL Volkswagen model.

This was the first car that I bought on my own, and I've had nothing but wonderful experiences with it. :) 

I bought the car used, with 20,000 miles, for $16,900.  The first thing I want to comment on was the dealer experience.  I bought the car from Van Dyn Hoven Imports (http://www.vdhauto.com), in Appleton, Wisconsin.  The service I received from the Sales Department was phenomenal.  I had a very low pressure buying experience, and the wonderful sales staff was there to help me 100% of the way.  They made me feel welcome, at home and comfortable.  Volkswagen Dealership's generally don't lower the price on a vehicle a whole lot, which means you avoid the traditional "haggle-my-price" dealer experience.

The car drives beautifully.  My particular model has the heated front seats, and I could never drive without them again.  There is nothing more WONDERFUL than being able to get into your car in the morning, and have "toasty buns" within a minute of beginning your drive.  Especially in a cold climate, the heated seats are a must ;-).  The comfort in the front seat is wonderful.  The seat slides forward and backward, the back tilts, AND you are able to pump the seat up and down to get yourself higher or lower, depending upon height.  I'm 6'0" tall and fit EASILY in my VW Jetta.  The car drives smoothely, you don't feel much "bump" on the road.  The car I previously drove was a Plymouth Neon, and this one drives MUCH more comfortably.  You actually feel like you're a little ways off the ground, too :).

The back seat is small.  No joke.  If you don't have a short person riding in front, you'll probably only want children in back.  With the front seat pushed all the way back, and adult could *not* likely sit in the backseat right there.  Children yes, adults no.  If backseat space is a must, get a Passat ;-).

The Jetta is beautiful.  The external is stylish, and people look at you with somewhat of a "respectful" aspect when they see you driving your VW, honest :).  Mine is Green, and it doesn't look dirty easily, either :).

A couple gripes about the interior...
My car has the Velour seats, which are total lint magnets.  If you have pets like I do, you'll likely have hair on your car seats :).  Get the leather or cloth seats and you won't have this problem, however.
Additionally, there's the occasional "creek" or "rattle", which I hear are common in German automobiles.  Nothing that bothers me, but if you're *extremely* sensitive to that sort of thing, you might want to test drive extensively to see what I mean :).

Enough about the comfort though, it's AMAZING!! On to the good stuff :-).

The TDI engine is awesome.  I drive the automatic, and get 40 miles to the gallon, on Diesel fuel which in my area is CHEAPER than unleaded.  Sure the pump's are a little dirtier, but when you can drive 500 miles in between fill-ups, you get over it ;-).  The resale value on the TDI's is great.  The Diesel engine holds up very well, and if you take care of your car, expect a good 350,000 miles out of it.

Maintenance is expensive, yet not, at the same time.  It uses Synthetic oil, which'll cost you about $20/gallon.  Changing the oil yourself would cost about $30.  HOWEVER, you can go 10,000 miles in between oil changes!! :-) No joke! :-)

The other expensive maintenance issue is the "Timing Belt", which has to be replaced every 40,000 - 80,000 miles, depending upon your model.  Most new belts are 80,000 mile belts.  Expect to pay $300-$400 when this timing belt needs to be replaced.

OTHERWISE, the TDI engine is very low maintenance, you can drive 10,000 miles before doing anything to it, and it'll last you a very LONG time!! :-).  The 40MPG is just an added bonus :-).

With the TDI engine, you have access to one of the most wonderful resources on the web...a site that'll teach you ANYTHING you want to know about the TDI, http://www.tdiclub.com.  If you're enthusiastic about the TDI, this site will save your life 1,000 times over.  READ IT before AND after buying a TDI, you will NOT regret it! :).

The TDI Engine is a 4-cylinder, with 90horsepower.  Don't let that fool you!  The TDI has great torque, and you DO feel powerful sitting in the driver's seat of it!! :)  Test drive...honest, after I did, I couldn't even fathom the THOUGHT of driving another car again!! :-).

The trunk space is great, a lot larger than you'd expect.

The "swithblade style remote key" is very cool, it impresses your friends :).

You can roll your windows up/down, with the KEY alone!.

It's one of the SAFEST cars in it's class, with front and side airbags, as well as Anti-lock brakes.  This helps with insurance ;-), and the Daytime running lamps do too!

The car has a factory alarm system, which is a deterrent to theft.

Reliability?  So far so good!  My Jetta has had only one very minor service needed, and the dealer was very friendly and helpful with the warranty repair, didn't cost me a thing ;-).  I don't anticipate any problems with my low-maintenance TDI!! :-).

One more thing... although the diesel does have a quiet "hum" to it, it's virtually SILENT while you're driving!! Don't let the word "Diesel" scare you away...TEST DRIVE!! :-).  Diesel Engines have come a LONG way over the years!
