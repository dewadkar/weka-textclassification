            I purchased the Pathfinder SUV in March 1998. After 18 months of combined Highway and City Driving I have found only one fault with it. On the highway you are missing that extra kick of horsepower to pass someone at 60 mph especially if you are going uphill. Other then that I absolutely love. It drives and handles more like a car then a truck. The finishing is fabolous, with no excess wind noise. At high speed and yes I have exceeded 90mph on a couple of occasions there is no wind noise from the windows to the sunroof.  To shift into 4 wheel drive is as easy as shifting from park into drive.

The heating and cooling system works exceptionally well but I must recommend on a hot summer day especially if you buy it in black like I did park it in the shade. If you cannot then turn on the A/C for a couple of minutes and wait outside.

I have driven many other SUV's and can honestly tell you that everyone should buy this one from a housewife to go around town to the rural dweller.

I highly recommend this vehicle and should anyone have any questions for me please feel free to E-Mail me at srjr@total.net
