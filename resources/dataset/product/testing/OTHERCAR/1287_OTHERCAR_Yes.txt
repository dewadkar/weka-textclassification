            I remember when my Uncle purchased this camera last year and showed it off to me.  I immediately took it out and shot some macro's and other general images to try it out.  He's since gotten a Canon D30 and let me buy his 990 for a great price.
Since owning the camera, I've had to send it to Nikon for a major service.  It seems that the lens assembly had to be replaced, as the eye finder was non functional.  My uncle had never used the eye finder, preferring the LCD so it is quite possible that it was bad from the start.  I've seen others mention having the same problem with their 990's, so it might be happening to more users.  The cost for the repair is $203 plus $10 for shipping.  Since getting the camera back, it has performed flawlessly.  Nikon did an excellent job in cleaning the unit, and left no marks to show that they had been inside the camera.
I won't go into detail about the images, they are generally excellent and the resolution is detailed enough to get 8x10 prints without grain.
Having used a Canon A50 prior to this, the rotating body is great to work with.  I normally use the LCD to compose my images, and I can hold the camera at any angle while aiming it at my subject while watching the LCD. (Normally it is my son at just over a 1 old who can't sit still for one second.  Bless his little busy mind.)
Battery usage is another matter.  As others have surely written, AA batteries are useless in this camera.  If you want to spend your hard earned cash and throw it away...use AA alkalines.  You might be lucky to fill one compact flash card (16MB) with one set of batteries....using the LCD.
I currently use two sets of Radio Shack 1600ma NiMh batteries that last an easy 200-300 photos.  I only take a dozen or so images per day, so one set lasts me about 2 to 3 weeks.
I've never used the Nikon software to download the images from the camera.  I've always used a SanDisk USB flash card reader.  The price of these readers has come down considerably, I don't know why Nikon and others for that matter don't just include them with the camera, instead of that silly USB cable that connects the camera to the computer.
Speaking of compact flash, the 16MB card is not much to work with.  You can get about 1 to 2 tiff images and you're full.  Kind of useless.  An option is the image wallet that is being sold out there that allows you to store 3 to 20 GB's on a portable HD that runs on batteries.  Why spend the money on a large flash card, when you can get the image wallet for less?  (Just my own opinion....not a plug.)  Unless you prefer to carry less with you, but knowing any photog out there, she or he will have a bag full of stuff to carry with them.
A sore point so far has been the internal (red eye) flash.  No matter what you try, you'll likely get red eyes.  As soon as I can afford it, I am going with an external flash setup.  I have the cord and hot shoe ready, just need an SB-23 flash.  
The overall feel of the camera in my hands is well balanced.  Given the initial problems with the lens assembly, I still love this camera.
