            Let me preface this review by saying that I would never spend $900 on a camera, digital or otherwise. I don't have the money for that. My wife and I received this camera as a gift from her parents last Christmas. "An extremely generous gift" you might say. Well, you are correct. In any event, we were pleasantly surprised to be given this camera. Let me explain the camera to you very briefly from a non-professional photographer's point of view...

The Camera has a great shape to it. It's small and light and fits nicely into your hand. It is very aesthetically pleasing. It's silver surface and large zoom lens attract attention whenever i take it out. When turned on, there are 3 options Play, Still, and Movie. In Play mode you are able to view all of the pictures currently stored on your memory stick. You can do this by jogging through each picture 1 by 1 or by scrolling through an index. The pictures only take about 3 seconds to load on the screen, so patience is not required. 

In Still mode you are able to take still pictures. The features that the camera offers are so numerous that I wouldnt do them all justice. Besides, many of them are beyond my scope of need as a casual photographer. It is very simple to switch between color, B&W, Sepia, and Negative effects using the on-screen menu. The flash bulb pops up with the slide of a switch. When you press the little silver button to take a picture there is an audible 'click' that you hear that lets you know you have taken a picture. 

In Movie mode, you are able to shoot MPEG movies. I have only used this feature once with mixed results. The Camera actually captured the sound well, as i was taping my wife singing. The video was not the best quality, but i'm sure if i played with the settings i could get it to be better.

Let me recap the pros and cons with this camera for you...

PRO-the camera looks great, is lightweight, and feels good and stable in your hands.

PRO-For the first time user, the camera is easy to operate, just turn on, put in STILL mode, and press the shutter button.

PRO-The USB cable (supplied with camera) has worked great for me. Pictures are uploaded to my computer at a rate of about 3-15 seconds per picture (depending on what resolution you have it set on).

PRO-The highest resolution lets you take clear, crisp, 8.5x11s. The lowest setting still gives you clear 3x5's

PRO-The camera shuts itself off after 5 minutes of no-use so you dont waste the battery.

PRO- The MGI Photosuite software that came with the camera has been very clutch for me. It works great and i use it a lot.

CON-The price. This bad boy is gonna run you at least 900 bucks. If you got the money, then i by all means recommend it. If you're scrapped for cash, you might do better getting a $50 cheapy at Wal-Mart. 

CON-The Manual is alright, but i thought it could have been better written. There are alot of features that i havent explored with mine for fear of mining through the manual for the information

CON-No case. They include a brochure featuring a nice case you can buy for around 40 bucks. But after paying all that money for the camera, its like a small slap in the face.

CON-The memory stick included is only 8MB. this didnt affect me because my in-laws included a 32MB stick with our present that is more than adequate. I can take 50 pictures at a mid-level resolution and still have space left. If i only had 8MB i would be annoyed.

CON- The battery does tend to run out pretty fast, but i like the meter which lets you accurately know how long you have left. If Sony would have included a second battery, they would have added a ton of value to this product.

CON- The flash is extremely bright. Maybe there's a setting where i can change that, but i havent found it yet. almost every pic i take with the flash makes the subjects look as if they have not been in sunlight for 2-3 years. I often take pictures w/o it and then enhance the pictures and brighten them using the software supplied.
