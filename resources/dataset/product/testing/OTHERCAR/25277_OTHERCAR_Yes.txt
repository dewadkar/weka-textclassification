            If you see what this camera can do, I will fall in love right away!

Epson PhotoPC 800 is one of the latest Digital Camera offers, provided with maximum resolution at 1984 x 1488 pixels, or in another words, 3 Megapixel (2.1 Mpixels and with Epson HuPic up to 3 MPixels). 

As any other Epson Family Digital Camera, PhotoPC 800 has the capability to preview the captured photo in an embedded 1.8&quot; LCD TFT micro monitor, and more (excellent idea!) you can record a sound message for every Photo you shoot, so you can hear it later and make extra adjustments, or remember  who to send a copy of it (or who DOT not send one), whatever you like anyway.

I didn't assumed that this little camera was so easy to use, until i saw that it has all the common cameras (not digital) adjustment features. This is great! I can use it like my old camera, and not loosing precious time, for hard to use tricky adjustments! You can set auto time-delay shoot,zoom, focus, iris diaphragm closing speed, light tones (White) balance and frequency of capture.

With this camera, I can connect my Epson 1270 A3 (as any other Epson printer) via USB or Parallel port and print right away my digital photos!
Amazing! 

The quality is so perfect, that I can't express with words, really amazing, never thought that any Digital Camera could have these results.
I know that there are other great cameras too, giving hi-res, but this one is one piece of perfection.Great!
