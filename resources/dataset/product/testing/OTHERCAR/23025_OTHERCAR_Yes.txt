            We bought this camera after our first daughter was born and scanner broke. We wanted a cheap digital camera and looked at all the major stores. We finally narrowed it down to this one at Wal-Mart. It was 179.99 on clearance. Unfortunately there display wasn't working and we wanted to see what it was like before we bought it. So we went to another store which we could actually had a working display and price match plus 10%. So we got it for under $170.

For a basic digital camera it's pretty good. It doesn't have zoom and the resolution isn't very high, but it gets the job done. Well that is as long as you have plenty of batteries. We started out using regular AA batteries, but that got expensive when you had to replace them very two weeks, we used it quite a bit. So we bought rechargable ones and it helped as far as cost, but now we have to recharge the batteries very couple of days.

It is very simple to use, &quot;Just point and click&quot;, sorta. It has a small LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) that you can look at to see what you are taking a picture of. The LCD is fairly clear, so you have no problem see the object your taking a picture of. The bad thing about the LCD is that it is what eats up the batteries, that's probably why they including the regular camera style peep hole.

I don't know if we just got a bad one or what but sometimes the LCD won't come on. We have to shake it a little in order for it to finally come on.

There are two versions out there of this camera. Actually the cameras are the same, but one has a 3.5&quot; floppy disk adapter and the other just had the serial cable.

Last I checked Polaroid hadn't updated the driver and when I had Windows ME installed it didn't want to work with the camera. So I had to go back to Win98, the only reason I went back.

So do I recommend it. Yes, to those that are looking for a cheap digital camera and are just getting started. No, to those that have $500 or more spend on a really good one.
