            Greetings!  I leased a 1997 Acura 2.2CL Premium (one of the very first to be delivered in Los Angeles, #6 to be precise) with an automatic transmission, dealer-installed wood dash and the OEM spoiler on the trunk.  The following is a summary of my experiences with the car...

Upon delivery, there was one manufacturers defect: the power glass sunroof seals were defective.  The entire unit was replaced under warranty two days after I took delivery.  Notably, the process took two days, and I was NOT given a loaner car of any type.  Bummer?  You bet!  Apparently, this is not actually Acura's policy, as they are supposed to provide you with a loaner car for any work that takes longer than one day (but I understand this varies from dealer to dealer --many of them don't give loaners at all).

Aside from that, I had no real problems with the car, as far as defects are concerned.  I did get my front bumper ripped off by some moron while waiting at a stop sign about 2 weeks after I got the car.  I was in the right-turn lane, and he was beside me (it was a 4-lane street).  He decided he was going to make a right from the left lane, but I guess he didn't realize I was beside him.  The repair costs were about what one would expect from such an accident --in other words, they weren't excessive.  I had the work done at a local body shop, as opposed to an Acura dealer (that would have cost more than double --he did not want to report it to his insurance company, so he just paid for the work).

I would have to say that the car was decidedly underpowered, but then again, I happen to be one of those people who likes high-revving four cylinder engines.  145hp is not enough for a car of this weight (at least not enough for my tastes), but the engine's rev-happy nature certainly made the car entertaining.  It was a blast to drive, and I kept the RPMs above 3,000 a lot of the time.

The engine really comes to life at about 3,200 rpm (revolutions per minute), as this is about where the VTEC (variable valve timing and electronic control) switches over to the more aggressive cam profile.  The feeling is one of a small turbo spooling up as the tach sweeps past 3,200.  By 5,000 rpm the engine is screaming (a sound I love), and the car is flying.  However, this is a trait probably best left to Integras, Celicas (the new one), Preludes, and other serious sports cars.

Many people do not expect that much engine noise from a luxury car (and the CL is defined as an entry-level 2-door luxury car).  If quiet freeway cruising is what you seek, forget about this car.  The engine noise during acceleration and at speeds over 50 mph is intrusive.  On the freeway, the engine noise is louder than the tire noise.

Stylistically, the pre-2000 CL (i.e. 1997 to 1999) is an attractive looking car (at least to me) with a few unique design characteristics.  Most notably, the trunk and rear end of the car is very interesting, sporting a crease down the middle and cats-eye styled tail lamps.  Also, there is no keyhole for the trunk, and this contributes to the clean lines of the rear end.

From the front however, the CL looks like a slightly sleeker version of the previous-generation Honda Accord, upon which it is based.  Inside, it's the same theme: it looks a lot like an Accord coupe, but it's definitely nicer, cleaner, and much more pleasing to the eye and hand.  The faux wood trim is tastefully done, as are the chrome bits that appear here and there in the interior.  The leather is smooth and supple, and the seats are very comfortable (if a little on the flat side).  Controls are all logicaly placed and very intuitive to use.  The automatic climate control system is a snap to use, and works like a charm (although it can be noisy).  Overall, the interior looks and feels about as sleek as the exterior.  The standard CD stereo system is decent too --something I absolutely require in any car.

In other words, this is a sleek, well done design that while very unique when viewed from the rear, is a tad on the bland side from the front and inside.  Overall, a nice packaging job though.  I found it appealing enough to lease one, after all --and I'm pretty fussy.

One area where this car shines is interior and cargo space.  The trunk is quite large, easily accomodating luggage for two for a week away, or a major shopping trip to the supermarket.  A nice surprise for a two-door coupe, the back seats are actually suitable for two six-foot adults.  I am about 6 feet tall, and I fit back there just fine (although foot room isn't great).

Reliability should be excellent, although I cannot attest to the long-term aspects of this personally, since I only leased the car.  The CL was heavily based on the previous-generation Honda Accord coupe, and shares much of it's mechanicals, structure, etc.  The reliability of Accords is legendary, and it would surprise me if the CL were not every bit as reliable.  I have not heard of any major problems or snafus.  Apparently, the defective sunroof seals on my car were an isolated incident.

In summary, I liked driving this car, although I must say that the suspension was a tad too firm due to what felt like a very short travel.  Expansion joints would go &quot;ka-thunk&quot;, right through the steering wheel and the seat of your pants.  As this vehicle is a front-driver, handling was decent, even on wet roads.  The car felt very nimble, with a bit of understeer while cornering.  Due to the fact that I lived in the congested west side of Los Angeles at the time, my car was an automatic.  I imagine a 5-speed would have livened things up quite a bit.

This car is no Honda Prelude, nor is it a Lexus SC Coupe.  It's somewhere in the middle, providing a comfortable, roomy cabin, unique (if conservative) styling, acceptable handling, acceleration and decent fuel economy.  When new, my car cost about $24,000, including the Premium package (leather and automatic transmission), spoiler and the added wood trim.  Today, you could buy one of these for between $10,000 and $16,000, depending upon the milage and the condition of the car.

I would definitely reccommend this car to anyone who wants something stylish and reliable, and does not mind a buzzy engine.  Acura builds good cars, and my experience was a good one.  The Acura Cl is a classy, fun, and reliable car.

Thanks for reading my Epinion!  I hope you found it to be helpful and informative. :-)<br><br>
