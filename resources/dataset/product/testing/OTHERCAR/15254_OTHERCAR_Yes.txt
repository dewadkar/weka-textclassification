            I bought my 1991 Grand Am brand spanking new. It's a 2-door coupe with a 2.5 liter fuel injected 4 cylinder engine. At age 11, it now has 293,000 miles on it. Same tranny, same engine. Overall, it runs great. 

We replaced the heater core in 1994, clutch kit in 1994, motor mounts and other small items over the years.  Also regular maintenance including brakes, plugs, etc. since day one. We are on our fourth starter (third one in a year) and fourth alternator. All are remanufactured.

In June 2001, (at about 270,000 miles) the car started "bucking" then stalling. They replaced the fuel pump (original one) but that didn't work. After much misdiagnoses, turns out to be the crankcase censor and ignition module.

Fast forward to June 2002 (293,000 miles) We stop the car for errands and restart minutes later...won't start. Will turn over, but won't catch and start up!  Let it sit for a while then it's fine. Mechanics said it was starter. They replaced it (making starter #4 I mentioned above) but that wasn't the problem. More diagnoses and they said it's the fuel pump. So they replace it a year after we replaced the original one! Warranty is one month expired!!

Windows are a PAIN! I bought this with no A/C so we roll the windows down every day. Many times the windows come off track and the clips break. 

Console cover broke years ago. What do you expect? It's made of plastic.

Gas cap lever broke long ago. The spring popped and I had to do what one of the previous reviewers here had to do...make sure something was holding the lever in the up position so I could run to the other side of the car to open the lid to the gas tank!  I used rubber bands and hooked it to the lever that moves the seat!  Nowadays my husband pops the lid from inside the trunk. 

Paint job. The paint started to chip way back when it was about 5-6 years old. It's still holding up but it's fading pretty fast on the roof of the car.
