            1998 Dodge Caravan SE/LE - 6 cylinder, PS/PB/Automatic Windows/AC/Front Wheel Drive/2 sided doors/retractable rear seats - easy out when needed/ rear window washer and defogger/fog lights/Captains seat for front - bench seats for back/AM/FM Radio - Cassette player/Security lock. 

Now that I have THE VAN that I had wanted for a couple of years I can honestly say that I am not unsatisfied with it. However, as with any new vehicle you purchase there are always going to be some shortcomings and pitfalls. With this van (I bought brand new off the lot) I particularly was looking for a vehicle to provide me with comfortable passenger seating, easy access into and out of the van, great peripheral viewing from the drivers seat, easy maneuverability of the seats, good air conditioning/heating system, good sound system, etc..Did I get what I wanted. Mostly. Am I happy with the vehicle? pretty much. I like the easy in and out. I like being able to remove the back seats and easily put them back in when purchasing large items (saves me money on having to wait for delivery trucks for items I can now haul myself). I find the drivers seat to be comfortable and situated in such a way that it is easy to see the road and maintain good peripheral vision. I definitely like having two side doors one on each side for passengers to get in. Really useful when you have children and older people or passengers who might be mad with each other.  I like the air conditioning system (works great in the back - on hot days the passengers really complain about it being cold back there. Keeps kids comfortable). The sound system is good and the van handles real nice when driving in traffic, around curvy roads, etc.. Even in the snow which I was able to test out last winter.  

Some things I don't like about it. Front wheel tires seem to lose their tread at a much faster rate then the back tires and front tires on other front wheel drive vehicles. These are the original tires on the van and there are less then 15,000 miles on car. Treads should not be down to the bare minimum. Seems to be some rust at the top of the sliding doors on either side. Doesn't appear as though they put the correct primer on the paint. Gas mileage is not what is projected for city driving. (although I do live in a hilly area so that might create more of a problem). Highway driving provides for more miles to the gallon - pretty much what is on the sticker. 

When driving up a hill it seems as though the transmission is not as powerful as stated. On other six cylinder cars (and vans as well) when going up hills I always seemed to be able to maintain the speed going uphill (some hills here are 6 - 9% grade - incline.) With this van it seems like you have to get the van going fast prior to going up the hill otherwise you will have to push the gas pedal all the way down and wait for the transmission to kick-in to pick up speed again. 

When driving the with all the windows closed, you can hear some noises from the outside (like airflow). However, there is not a lot of creaking on the van (unless you don't put the seats back correctly after taking them out.). The shock system appears to be okay, although I would have expected a much smoother ride on bumps then what I'm getting in a new car. There are some amenities to the car which make it nice. Besides the glove compartment, their is a drawer below the passenger seat for storing maps, etc., and they have a net on the side of the passenger seat for other storage. I find them to be very helpful. 

One very important thing about this car. If you are not used to vans and you get a flat with this van like I did you can expect to be confused by their instructions on replacing the tire etc. As a matter of fact the tire is underneath the car and the bolt that holds the tire does not come off all the way. You have to play around with the mechanism in order to get the tire off. If you have triple AAA you are better off calling them to assist with the tire change. Otherwise have fun changing the tire. 

One other note about this van. I like it for trips. With a turtle on top, and a TV located in the middle for kids to watch their movies, you can easily be in this van for long periods of time without feeling claustrophobic. That to me is important when traveling with kids. Last year on our trip we were in the van for up to 14 - 16 hours in one day. Believe me when I say this, if the van was not comfortable I would have traded it in by now. 

An update to my original review - 01/10/2000 - 
 
I now have about 18,000 miles on the van and recently ran into some problems with the ignition. On Christmas Eve I went to turn the car on and the ignition would not turn. No matter what I tried I couldn't get the ignition key to move at all, even though I tried readjusting the steering wheel, pressing the brakes and turning the steering wheel etc.. I called 1-800-roadside service, (they were good, they sent a tow truck in a decent amount of time). The tow truck driver could not get the ignition key to turn as well so we towed the van to the dealership where I bought it. Unfortunately I had to wait for them to open after the holidays, but when they tried to get the ignition key to turn they too had problems. What they did was to take the steering column out and grease it and put it back together. This worked for about a week when I started having problems again. I brought the van back to the dealership and they replaced the entire steering column with the ignition etc.. Since it has only been a few days with the replaced items I have not run into any problems since. I will update if I run into a problem again. 

The only other problem I had with the van was with the sealer on the windshield which was coming loose. I brought the van back to the dealer and they replaced the windshield entirely and put a new sealer on. Basically, the dodge dealer has been good about correcting problems with the car during the warranty. I think that is a real plus.
