            I was looking for a 2 megapixel camera with optical zoom. The Fuji Finepix 2600 had the features I wanted and primarily good reviews.

This camera replaces my old (1998) HP Photosmart C30. I am amazed at how much difference there is. My old camera (1 megapixel) took good photos outdoors and acceptable ones of people inside. It did not do well with small items.

The Finepix 2600 takes great closeup photos of items--showing lots of detail. It is being phased out by Fuji and being replaced by the 2650. The major difference I see between them is that the 2600 uses SmartMedia cards and the 2650 uses Fuji's XD photocards.

I was amazed at the speed that the photos upload via the USB cable. My old camera took 3-4 minutes per photo. The new one does them almost instantaneously. The software that comes with the camera does a great job with simple things (cropping, changing image size), but doesn't have some of the features that my old software had. I will be using Microsoft's Picture It to do most of my minor tweaking.

The drawback to making a simple point-and-shoot type camera that's easy to use right out of the box is that the more advanced settings are not easily accessible. You have to go through several menus on the LCD to set the flash mode, change the photo resolution, etc.

The 2600 is lightweight (compared to my old camera). Two AA batteries lasted me for several days of taking sample shots and uploading them plus going through the various menu options on the LCD. I have since purchased an AC adapter to use for uploading the photos. The 16 MB SmartMedia card doesn't hold as many photos as I'd like. I've purchased two 64 MB cards to use instead. (One of the advantages of the 2600 over the new 2650 is that the SmartMedia memory cards cost one-third of what the xD ones do.)
