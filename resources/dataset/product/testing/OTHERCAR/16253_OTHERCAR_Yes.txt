<TEXT>
            I bought a Toyota Corolla CE around 6 months back. It was 1999 model and I am using it for my office as well for my pleasure trips. Toyota Corolla was started in 1968 and has undergone so many changes that it has almost all the facilities that a luxury car has. You can get the comfort of a luxury car while paying a marginable less price when compared to others which cannot be mentioned over here. Toyota Corolla is being called as a World Car and it deserves the name.
The one I bought has Cruise control, power doors, power windows, power steering and auto transmission. I am fully comfortable with it now and I can proudly say that I am the owner of Toyota Corolla. I am happy with the smoothness in the drive and the comfortness with the vehicle. But, I do get complaints when some of my friends get seated at the back and was told that it is a bit congested for long drives.
