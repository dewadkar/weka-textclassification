            My parents recently bought a minivan. They were looking at them all. Windstars, Siennas, Town and Country's. But they finally decided to listen to me and go look at the Venture. I am king of fuel economy. I get upset when my car gets below 30 miles to the gallon. But I read somewhere that the venture gets the best mileage out of any major Minivan out there. What I also likes was that my fiends parents had one with not a problem for the whole year or two that they had it. I have a little side note here. Sienna's tail lights are way too small. I think that they are tiny in comparison to it's body. And the only way that we were getting a Windstar was if it was the SEL model which I really liked! But they don't like the idea of leather with my little sisters. 
So they got the Venture.
I really like these things about the Venture. 
* The Power Sliding doors 
* The compass, temp, miles per gallon thing. My grandma's Grand Cherokee used to have this. I loved it then and still do. 
* The key fob is shaped so that it fits correctly in your hand. 
* the seats are light weight and move easily. 


The only 2 things that I can say are less than pleased with are:
1. The rear heat controls are hard to locate while driving.
2. Ya know when it snows and the sun melts the snow? well every time that you step on the brakes during this "natural phenomenon" there is an endless supply of water that comes down and it is a pain in the neck to have to turn the wipers on to get a clear line of vision! Maybe that is because I am used to a little sports car with practically  no roof!?
