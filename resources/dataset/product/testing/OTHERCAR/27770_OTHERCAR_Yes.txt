            When I was looking at digital cameras, most of them seemed big and bulky, but not this one.  I wanted something I could take with me on ski trips and carry with me all the time.  The sturdy construction and small size make the Canon Powershot S100 perfect.  It takes excellent pictures and is very easy to use.

From the reviews I found on the internet, the S100 has slightly poorer picture quality than the S10 model, but it is still very good.  For me the size and construction were the key considerations.  Even if I get a good camera, what's the point if I'm too worried about breaking it or if it's too big for me to take with me?  Its square shape makes it fit well in a pocket and its stainless steel exterior feels solid and durable.

One thing I like about this camera is the autofocus.  Canon uses a field metering system to gauge the distance to the subject.  This means that it will accurately locate and focus on the intended subject most of the time.  Pressing down halfway on the shutter button focuses the camera, and pressing it down all the way takes the picture.  This two step process makes it easy to take action shots.  Just point the camera at something that's the same distance as your subject, press the button down halfway, and when you want to take a picture, press the button down all the way and it will release the shutter instantly.

Another nice feature is the anti-glare coating on the LCD.  The display is visible even in bright sunlight.  The LCD also allows you to zoom in and look at pictures while they are still on the camera.

An advantage this camera has over the S10 is the battery.  The S10 doesn't come with a rechargeable battery, which is essential for digital cameras.  The S100 comes with a rechargeable Li-ion battery which lasts for over 100 shots.  It only comes with 8 MB of memory, however, which is only enough for about 14 high resolution pictures.  I bought a 64 MB CompactFlash card for about $100 and now I can take over 100 pictures before I have to download them to my computer.

The camera has a USB interface for transferring pictures to a computer.  Most new computers have USB these days, but if yours does not, you can buy a compactflash reader for your computer.  The software is easy to use for organizing pictures and making minor adjustments.

Also, one minor caveat: if you look carefully on some of my Whistler pictures (url below), you will notice a diagonal stripe in the upper left corner that is darker than the rest of the picture.  It is not very noticeable in most of the pictures, but it's shows up pretty clearly on some of the cloudier pictures.  I went and exchanged my camera and now it works fine.

My biggest complaint about this camera is the weak flash.  I suppose you can't expect much from a camera this size, but the flash only works on objects closer than about 10 feet away.  Also, it only has 2x optical zoom, but I guess a longer lens wouldn't fit on a camera this small.  Otherwise, it's an excellent camera.  I take it everywhere I go, and since it's digital, I can take as many pictures as I want and not have to worry about wasting film.  Unless you are a professional photographer, you probably won't have any complaints about the image quality of this camera.
