            On October 12th, 1999 my 99 Saturn Coupe and I had an unfortunate accident. A GMC Yukon decided he wanted to try and beat a red light. Too bad there was a black saturn turning in front of him...needless to say..I was creamed...The Yukon slammed into the side of the car at 55mph...Major damage...$11,000 worth to be exact...Insurance wants to fix it...its been in the shop since october 18th..still dont have it back..what a pain..if someone would have been in the passenger seat, theyd be dead...Needless to say the car did its job in protecting the driver, however a passenger would have not been so lucky...Before that, car was great...never any problems, except the fact that the tires seem to attract nails easier than other cars. <br><br>
