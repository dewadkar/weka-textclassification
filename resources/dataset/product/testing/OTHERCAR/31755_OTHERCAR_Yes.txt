            The BMW 323i is a full fledged �ultimate driving machine� for people who enjoy motoring and like a posh, but functional driving environment.  Accommodations, while reasonable, are not generous.  The new generation 323i excels in providing active and passive safety features, but long term reliability and maintenance costs are yet to be proven. 

Ride and Drive:  As one would expect from BMW, the ride and drive of the 323i is exceptional.  The ride is supple, and well controlled.  The steering is very accurate and there is a great degree of adhesion during cornering with little body lean.   The 5 speed automatic transmission shifts smoothly as it goes up and down the gears.  Braking is very good, the stops are short and well controlled with no noticeable brake fade.  Road, engine and wind noise are suppressed.  The 323i is still a driver�s car; however, it has lost some of the sporting instinct found in the prior edition of the 3 series.

Accommodation:  Good for four people, five people will be tight.  The front seats are extremely comfortable and well shaped.  The rear bench seat is also comfortable, but can be tight for three people or  for people over 6 feet tall.  There is an annoying lack of storage within the car, just the map pockets, glove compartment and one covered slot under the radio.  The trunk�s a little bit tight for hauling big items around, but it is adequate for carting groceries and holding luggage for weekend trips.  The trunk has �scissor hinges�, so the trunk opens wide and there is no intrusion of hinges into the trunk.

Interior: Interior ergonomics are excellent with most controls falling easily into place.  BMW has made huge improvements in the interior build quality of the car.  Materials are top notch and the interior styling is very �rich�.    The �99 323i interior looks and feels like a BMW; whereas, earlier model 3 series cars compromised on interior appointments and materials. 

Exterior: The exterior style is evolutionary and looks like a slightly smaller 5 series.  My wife thinks it is among the most handsome cars on the road.  BMW has introduced new door pull handles on the 3 series, which are much easier to use than the door levers found on prior models.  The exterior build quality is excellent and the paint and finish are top notch. 

Safety and Convenience: The 323i comes with a long list of safety features, including front and side airbags, a head protection system (basically a head airbag), anti-lock brakes and traction control.   Fortunately, I have not used any of these safety features.  The standard headlights are exceptionally bright and clean (xenon headlamps are optional).  The standard radio is good, but not great.   All of the window controls and sunroof are �one-touch� operation, which allows one to completely open or close a window without holding down the switch.  The car lock, unlock and trunk release remote control are built into the key.  The key has an electronic anti-theft chip, but the car does not come with an alarm.  Single zone climate control is standard and is fairly effective.

Reliability and Maintenance: Reliability seems to be good.   I have had the car for 10k miles and have had no problems; however, I have received several recall notices.   Maintenance is included for the first three years / 36k miles. Oil change and maintenance intervals are monitored by the on-board computer, so there is no predetermined mileage interval for maintenance.  The car uses a synthetic oil blend, so there is a longer interval between oil changes but synthetic oil costs a lot more than regular engine oil.  I have not experienced what it costs to fully maintain the car, so I can�t comment on maintenance costs versus other cars.

Pricing: Pricing for the car can be a bit misleading.  BMW advertises the car at less than $27k, but it is not equipped with items that many people will want (e.g., sunroof, automatic transmission, alloy wheels, remote trunk release).  A nicely equipped 323i with automatic, leather, sunroof and premium package will typically list about $34k.  As an alternative, one can purchase the 323i with only the options desired and drop the package.  I purchased my car with automatic, sunroof, metallic paint, alloy wheels, cruise control, and a couple of other items for a list of $30k.  Options I did not take include electric seats, trip computer, front arm rest, wood inserts and leather interior (the standard leatherette interior is very nice and most people will not know the difference between leather and leatherette).  Additionally, one should check with their employer to determine if they are part of BMW�s corporate program.  Under this program, employees will receive a $500 rebate ($1,000 on the 328) direct from BMW when purchasing a new 323.  One should also have their financing pre-arranged before entering the BMW showroom, as I found BMW�s financing fairly expensive (about 1.75 percentage points above what I received from another source and 1 percentage point above the going rate in the area).
