<TEXT>
            Mazda 626 has been the most economical vechicle I have ever driven. I statred with my first 626 in 1995, traded that in for a 1998 626, and I'm ready for the 2000 Mazda 626. Number one reason is for its comfort of a luxury vechicle @ a compact vechicle price. Ever since my first Mazda and through my second the maintance is fantastic. As long as You keep up with regular oil change you will never have too take the vechicle in for maintance. I recommend this vechicle to any Buisnees Associate or use it as a family vechicle.Thank You for giving me the oppurtunity to express my delight on this vechicle.
                  Sincerely;
                  Shane<br><br>
