            At $450-500, the Mavica FD-73 is a bit out of some families' price range.  When one considers that a good camcorder can be purchased for substantially less, one might question why someone would want a digital camera in the first place.

Thumbs Up:

1.) Light-weight:  Though it's bigger than your standard camera...it tips the scales at a scant 2(ish) pounds.

2.) Floppy Disks for Film!  No more running out to the store for film, or dealing w/ those annoying developing costs.  The Mavica saves all pictures to 3.5&quot; floppies.  The floppies are the same ones used with all computers.  All you have to do is copy them from the floppy to your hard drive and you're all set.

3.) Zoom:  The 10x zoom may not sound impressive, but it really is.  You're not going to get a great look at Jupiter...but for most any situation, 10x zoom is more than enough.

4.) Battery Life:  Thankfully, the camera comes with both a battery and a charger.  It takes about an hour for the battery to charge -- and the Mavica will run for about two hours from a single battery.

5.) Plenty of Settings:  The Mavica sports settings for action, daylight, night time, portraits and landscapes.  Since the camera is automatic, this really comes in handy when you need to make slight adjustments based on the speed / lighting of what you're photographing.

6.) Picture Effects:  It's pretty cool to be able to alternate between B&amp;W, Sepia, negative art, and solarized modes.  You can get artsy, classy, or snap away in color.

7.) In-camera editing:  Though you can't change the way pictures look on camera, you can run a slideshow of all of your pictures, and delete those blurred or incriminating ones before they hit the press.

8.) Varying record modes:  Choose from E-mail, Bitmap and Multi.  Email mode creates two copies of a picture (one normal and one smaller one to cut down on transmission time).  Bitmap is for background images for your desktop.

9.) Varying Quality levels:  Choose between standard and fine.  Standard allows more pics per disk at a slightly lower resolution.

10.) Easy controls.  You don't have to have dwarf-sized hands to control this thing.  Out of all the digital cameras on the mainstream market, this is by far the easiest to manipulate.


Thumbs Down:

1.) Poor &quot;print-out&quot; resolution:  Though Mavica-taken images look great on the web or through email, they leave much to be desired when printing them out to an inkjet printer.  There's a shot that you could get a good print out using a hi-tech color laser printer, but those suckers go for over $5,000 a piece.

2.) Auto focus:  Everyone loves this feature and (as stated above) it has its merits...but not all of the time.  When shooting THROUGH something (like a fence) it is very hard to focus on the subject in the background.  (IE at Zoos, it is hard to focus through the bars to take a nice picture of an animal.)  

3.) Limited storage capacity.  Though floppies are a convenient media for storage, the down side is that just 15-22 pictures can be stored per disk.  This makes for much shifting and digging through bags looking for fresh disks.  I missed a few good shots because of this.

4.) &quot;Write to Disk&quot; time.  After you snap a picture, the Mavica takes several seconds to save it to disk.  Unlike a standard camera, you can't just keep clicking away.  This is a bummer when it comes to capturing sports or any other action where you'd like a close sequence of shots.

5.) Carrying case (not included) looks like...a purse!  Sorry, but I just feel a little awkward carrying this thing around.  

6.) Size:  Compared to the 35mm cameras that most Americans are used to, this one is pretty big.  They just don't make pockets big enough for these things.

7.) Outdoors:  When it's too sunny out, it can be hard to see what you're taking a picture of.  Since it's designed with the perspective of a Sharp ViewCam, and not a typical camcorder (w/ viewfinder) the sun interferes with the little LCD monitor.  Unless you shade it thoroughly, you're getting pot luck for pictures.


Overall, I'd recommend this camera for families, online auctioneers, and web page enthusiasts.  It's great for sending photos over the web and is a nice entry-level digital camera.  By the time you're tired of this one, new models will be out and hopefully they'll cost less than $400 (as they become more popular).

If you're looking to print pictures out, I'd suggest coughing up $200-500 more for one of the more advanced models.  The FD-73 is perfect for consumers, but is, by no means, a professional's camera.<br><br>
