            My 2000 CRV has been an incredibly reliable car.  I live in LA and it has handled the stresses of LA driving very well.  One of the attractive features of the car is that you get the benefits of an SUV (sitting up high in traffic, lots of cargo space) without having a giant SUV.  This also contributes to cheaper fill-ups at the pump.  Another nice feature is the ease with which the back seats "fold down" to open up the cargo area.  In addition, there is a table folded up in the wheel well.  I've never used it, but I imagine it would be convenient for camping or tail-gating parties.

The only repair I've had done on the car was when one of the arms that holds up the rear window broke.  The dealership was able to replace it immediately and I've had no other problems.  It would be nice if the car had more pick-up, but this is an issue Honda has addressed with the 2002 CRV.

I am short (5 feet 3 inches) and found the head rests in the back seat blocked a good portion of the rear-view mirror.  I removed those and now have a unobstructed view.  They are on hand if I need to pop them back in.

Another minor inconvenience is that the drawer under the front passenger seat is difficult to move.

Overall, the car is great.  I definitely recommend it and would buy the car again in a heartbeat.
