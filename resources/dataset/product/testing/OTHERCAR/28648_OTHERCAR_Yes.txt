               I was waiting for the prices to come down on the digital cameras. The Kodak had the best combination of a trusted brand and good styling. the photos are very good quality, 90% of what I used to send out for. The screen on the back was the icing on the cake. Whatever camera you choose I would highly recommend this feature. Kids love the instant reviews and you can delete the &quot;thumb&quot; pictures right away. 
After a week I bought a 32M chip and now can fit the whole vacation, over 100 pictures. I would also recommend the AC adapter. The base software (included free) if fine, I opted for Adobe Photo Deluxe 4.0, its more powerful. Start with the base, the Adobe wasn't cheap. This camera uses batteries quickly. Families with kids 3-16 should buy this product. I print on a Lexmark 3200 printer, not an expensive printer, and the results are very good. Don't skimp on the photo paper, I found HP Premium Photo Paper, Glossy to be the best. You can also print on postcards, great for invitations and cheaper than the Hallmarks !<br><br>
