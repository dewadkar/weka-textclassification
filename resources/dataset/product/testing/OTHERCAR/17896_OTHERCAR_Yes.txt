            I don't know why anyone would want a v8 in a 3800 pound luxury car that goes from 0 to 60 MPH in 7.5 seconds using a 210 HP v6 engine, also, bear in mind that this car does this with a front wheel drive, which handles far superior to a rear wheel drive, especially in snow covered roads. I have bought 10 new Lincolns since 1971, they are very fine automobiles, would have bought another one had I not test driven the Acura RL, which I think is the finest car on the market today for the money, sure, the Lexus LS400 has a v8, but, it costs about $18000 more, too, and how long does it take the Lexus to go 0 to 60?  It takes the same time! Another reason I switched to the Acura is the depreciation is not nearly as great after 2 or 4 years as is the Lincoln. I do agree that they should install a compass, even though I have the Navigation System.<br><br>
