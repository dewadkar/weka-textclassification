            Having just started our family, we had not planned to get a family car for at least another year or two.  My husband was dead-set against a mini-van.  He dearly wanted an SUV.  However, a convergence of good luck (refinancing the house, 0% financing for 5 years, end of the 2002 model year, end of the month, and reliable word of mouth re: the Town & Country) we decided to see what our local dealer had on the lot.  We wound up buying the very last 2002 (LXi) and so got a nice deal on it.

<b>The Good:</b>

3.8L Engine gives a nice bit of power to a pretty large vehicle.  The 3.8L V6 engine is one of my husband's favorite "features" - if there's one thing he hates, it's an underpowered vehicle.

Even though the T&C is really big (at least to me - my last car was a 1998 Honda Accord) it has easy "carlike" handling.  I seldom feel like I'm wielding a van.

The chairs are very comfy - ours are leather and include the seat warmers - a lovely addition on those chilly days.  Armrests fold down.  The cupholders will hold up to a 1L bottle (very important to me as I'm a big water drinker) 

There is an overhead console that allows you to open doors from inside, and features include a trip meter, timer, instant mpg readout and compass.

Let me tell you, as a new mother, I can not put a price on the automatic opening doors (including the hatchback).  My son is a real "hold me" baby so I'm usually carrying him.  It is SO convenient to be able to "click" open the side door to put him in his carseat and/or the rear door to put away my groceries and the stroller (which for me is a glorified shopping cart! LOL)

Climate control is fantastic.  I love that the Driver, Passenger and the Rear of the Van can all adjust their specific climate zone as needed.  I usually drive with my temperature around 78, where my husband's side is usually around 66!  It's so nice that I'm not stuck in an overly cold car when he's driving, and he's not stuck in an overly warm one when I'm driving.

Audio - we have not used this feature yet, but when our kids get older, it will probably come in handy.  The T&C has wireless headphones for the back of the van so the folks in the back can listen. Thus parents can listen to their thing while the kids can listen to theirs.

The middle and back rows of seats are all easily folded down and removed.  Now they're a bit heavy, but once I got the hang of it, it's not hard to take them in and out.  One neat thing is the folded down seat has cupholders in the back.

There are lots of storage/bungee hooks all over the van.  On the back of every seat and in the trunk area of the van, making it easy to secure cargo.

One fantastic little feature we discovered, which is not at all played up is there is a little green map light that's always on.  You would never notice it is on until you pass your hand or some paper underneath.  It is great in that it allows driver or passenger to look at a map or directions (or whatever) without ruining the driver's night vision.

Another nice convenience is that there is room for a full-size spare.  Very comforting to know that if there's a tire problem, we won't have to rely on a tiny donut to get our family to the next service station.

Yet another nice touch is the middle console is nicely designed to hold your cellular phone, and it has an upper and lower area for lots of storage.  It can also be moved from between the driver seats to between the middle row of seats as needed.

There is an abundance of power outlets. One in the cellphone console, two by the driver and passenger, two in the middle row and I think there are even two for the back row as well.  Made it very easy when I had to pump (I'm a nursing mother) during a longish drive.

I've ridden as the driver, the front seat passenger and a middle seat passenger, and I have been comfortable in ALL three places (though admittedly, I kind of wish I had the seat warmer in the back!)

<b>The Not So Good:</b>

I really wish the T&C had the "magic" seat that automatically hides away.  That looks like it would be So handy!

There is not as much "trunk" room as I would expect from such a big van - I guess the passenger area is roomy at the trunk area's expense.  Don't get me wrong - it's not awful or super tiny, it's just not as big as I was expecting.  I wind up driving with one of the rear seats permanently folded to accommodate our huge stroller.

This is nit-picky, but I hate the CD holder.  It doesn't seem to hold the CDs very well, nor does it hold very many.  It seems to me that with a little bit of a redesign, it would be SO much more useful.  Also, it is not accessible when I'm using the cupholder.

<b>Tip for the Frugally Minded:</b>
I just checked the Chrysler website (http://www.chrysler.com/town_country/) and they're offering 0% financing for 60 months or $2500 Cash Allowance (Go for the 0%) PLUS a Leather-Trimmed Seating Credit on the LXi or Limited models.  And no monthly payments for 90 days.  It's a good time to get a new car.  If you wait until the end of the month, or better yet, until the end of the  2003 model year, you just might get a sweet deal!

Incidentally,the only major difference I see between the 2002 and the 2003 is the 2003 comes with a 6-disc CD changer and the 2002 comes with a 4-disc changer.
