            our family needed cargo space but did not want a big suv. we had never owned a honda, but 24000 miles later we are very impressed by this one.all it has needed is routine oil changes. pluses include easy parking, back seats fold down easily and well designed controls. minuses include a noisy interior at high sppeds, limited rear visibility due to the rear seat headrests and low gas mileage when driving around town. but for someone who has never owned a suv and who wants excellent reliability the crv is an outstanding buy.<br><br>
