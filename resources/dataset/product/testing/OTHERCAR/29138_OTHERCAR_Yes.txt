            The Volvo V-70 XCAWD is a very, very nice car, but for 39,000 bucks, it aint soo nice. The car has some pluses though, the four wheel drive system is very advanced and the car drives very smoothly. The interior is plush, it's like a benz, but a volvo. The cd changer is amazing, and the sound system is definitley another pro. The heated front seats make my ass warm in the coldest of winters, and the memory-change seats is another great feature. The car handles exceptionally well in the snow, almost as good as an SUV. The car also drives very fast, with a top speed of 128 mph. It's a very nice car, but a bit too pricy for a family, luxurious station wagon. What ever happend to that wagon that the brady's had? It's the safest car I've had by the way, that makes it good : )<br><br>
