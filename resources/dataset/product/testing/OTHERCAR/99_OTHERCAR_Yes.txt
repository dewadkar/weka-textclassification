            I got a miata because I was introduced to autocross when I owned a civic. When I saw stock miatas posting lower times than corvettes, I saw the path ahead of me. I picked up a 97 STO a while ago and I am in the process of turning it into a ferocious boost monster.

First off, a well driven stock miata with a few bucks thrown into the suspension and tires will smoke almost any car around a tight course. Unfortunately, most stoplight races and highway encounters are based around plain old horsepower and torque, which the miata doesnt really have much of at all. To throw a bone to the honda crowd, its sort of like driving a civic hatch with an integra LS swap. Definitely not slow, but you wont be eating any mustangs this week (but what about a turbo LS?). 

Now on to the good good news. The miata starts off as a fun and affordable car that is decently fast. However, a gearhead might notice that the miata has oil ports on the side of the engine which arent used- how can this be? Well, it turns out that the miata engine is based off of the 323 GTX rally block, which ran about 8 psi of turbo boost stock, but could supposedly eat about 18psi without burping. Basically, it turns out that the miata has a strong bottom end that takes boost that would grenade most other car's engines in a minute. In short, its fairly affordable to make a miata VERY VERY VERY fast without sacrificing the superb miata reliability. The engine was made to run 100k miles on about 8-12 psi of boost.

Add in the traditional mods to the chassis and suspension and you have a vette killer for about 10-15 grand- that is also a barrel of monkeys worth of fun to drive.
