            I have already reviewed my parents' '97 Corolla, a 5 speed manual equipped car with the smaller 1.6 liter engine. Yeah, I know, a pretty gutless power-train from the sound of it, but the stickshift tranny actually makes this car scoot if you know how to use it. 

My grandmother also has a Corolla, a '93 with a 4-speed auto in the same body style as ours. And I couldn't help wondering, how big is the performance difference really? And so I had to find out for myself. Car- pooling duty for my younger sister provided the perfect opportunity, as my parents' ride was currently in the shop for service. &quot;A corolla in need of repairs?&quot; You may ask incredulously. Don't worry, the car would still have a flawless reliability record if my mother hadn't left it idling with the air conditioning on for a long period one hot day and caused a leak in the radiator. But that's a whole different story.

My grandmother's car is a light blue. One of the most incredible things about it that I notice on all Toyotas I see nowadays is the durability of the paint. It's not an especially deep, extremely glossy shine, but it's attractive, and more importantly, nothing seems to be able to take it off. Believe me, I know, my grandmother is not much of a driver. There seems to be a new dent or two on the car every time she comes back up the driveway, but at the point of impact though there may be dents or dings the paint surface usually isn't broken and I can't find any really deep scratches or chips.

The weather stripping though is a different story. It has started to curl up and peel off in a few places, which makes me wonder if maybe they used a less durable method to attach it that year.

Mechanically, it seems to be holding up the way you would expect a Toyota car to. So far it's at 37,000 miles. My grandmother is rather absent minded in her old age and to the best of my knowledge preventative maintenance on this car is performed sporadically, if ever. And yet it never fails to start. The only problem I found was a very minor steering wheel vibration.

When I get in the car, everything is clearly marked and easy to use. The radio is mounted above the climate controls, the way I like it, and everything is marked in big, clear letters and symbols. The climate controls are very simple and effective, heating or cooling the car within a few seconds though I can usually feel a bit too much heat near my right foot.

The seats are nothing special. As with my parents' corolla they are OK for lateral support but lacking in thigh support and really pretty bad for lumbar support. I can't take long drives in either car without at least a tiny ache developing in my lower back after a couple hours. They are easy to adjust though, with the button for adjusting the recline at the side of the cushion and the button for adjusting the reach accessible by reaching below the front of the cushion. 

For interior storage you get a nice sized glove box and that's about it. The trunk will swallow a surprising amount of cargo. It has always had enough space for a week's worth of luggage for our family of four, though just barely.

Inside, it's not overly cramped but not cavernous either. This is, after all, a compact car. If all four passengers are average size or below they'll be nice and comfy. If anyone's bigger than average, it's a choice between whether those in front will be comfortable or those in back, but you can't have both and someone will end up a bit squeezed, though not intolerably so. There is also a lack of rear hip room.

The driver gets an engine temperature gauge, a speedometer, and a fuel gauge. A tachometer would be nice but isn't really that necessary in an automatic, though there's none in my parents' 5-speed either. That's another pet peeve of mine, but let me stick to the subject at hand. The steering wheel actually feels pretty good to me. It's contoured in the shape of your fingers where they normally would be as you drive, and the plastic is gritty and not slippery.

One thing I was annoyed at was the fact that the symbols on the gear selector were not lighted. I know, I know, it may sound retarded, but I haven't driven a car with an automatic transmission in almost two years, and even then only occasionally once I got a license. So I do not have the order of the gears on a floor shifter memorized. So I had to turn on the interior light sometimes and check to see where drive and reverse were on the gear selector. Maybe I'm stupid, I don't know, but they should at least have the thing lighted so you can see it at night.

The engine is quiet at idle and increases to a mildly aggressive hum at full throttle. The noise is almost never intrusive. Acceleration leaves quite a bit to be desired. To answer our original question, yes, there is a huge performance difference between a manual and an automatic, at least with this car. In my parents' manual I can use the engine's power to maximum efficiency and hold gear when I need it to pull hard. With the automatic I am at the mercy of the computer. From a standstill, when I stomp the gas nothing much happens until 20-30 mph because I can't get the revs up by slipping the clutch. In merging and passing situations you have to floor it and wait that second that seems to last forever for the engine to bump down a gear, which it does noticeably but not violently. And even then, it still doesn't pull hard. And the whole time I am thinking, &quot;Oh yeah, that's why I only drive stick.&quot;

Stops are short and controlled. The brakes are very reassuring, and pedal response is linnear. You can feel it start to slow at the very start of the pedal's travel and you can feel the braking power gradually increase from then until the pedal hits the floor. No sponginess, and there is no point when they suddenly grab.
 
Handling is good, not sporty. For that get a Neon. Here you get composed confidence. There is little body lean and the car is fairly agile. The steering is well weighted, staying light at first but getting heavier with speed, though it provides little road feel. It's the tires that give out on before anything else. And of course, not being able to downshift and hold gears coming out of corners doesn't help. &quot;Oh yeah, that's why I only drive stick.&quot;

Ride is very good, better than my parents' '97. It would be interesting to know what suspension differences there are. Small road irregularities are heard but hardly felt. Larger bumps cause disturbance of the cabin but are usually not jarring or very harsh.

OK, so I confess my bias!! I am an enthusiast! I don't know what's wrong with me! If I were sensible I would rate this car a perfect. After all, it's reliable, economical, safe, and does everything well enough, though it does nothing spectacularly. But it doesn't impress me in the least performance-wise. That being the case, my overall opinion is that with an automatic transmission this is a competent, reliable family car. With a 5-speed manual this is a competent, reliable family car that can chirp its tires from a standstill and summon good passing power on command. If you drive stick, get this car with one. If you don't, learn. If you're an enthusiast forced to settle for a family sedan due to some annoying circumstance or the other, such as that upcoming addition to the family, this car with an automatic will make you frown. With a manual you still won't be grinning but the corners of your mouth will dart upward just a tiny bit. If they would put a shifter in the car that didn't feel like it was connected to a bowl of pudding it might even become.... gasp... real fun to drive!!!
