            We have a 1996 Chevy Lumina.  We also have 2 kids and live in the HUGE state of Texas.  We have taken 2 long car trips so far with the car and have found it to be one of the most comfortable cars we have ever owned.  The driver's seat is large and roomy, and the tilt steering is a nice added feature.  The back seat has plenty of room for the children and all their toys.  My favorite feature though of this car is the trunk space.  I can fit 2 weeks worth of groceries in the trunk WITH my husband's golf clubs inside it (even though I TELL him to take them out! haha)  The back seats are set up high enough that the kids can see out the windows without too much complaint.  Our car also has the cloth seats that are easy to get stains out of (very important when a toddler is eating graham crackers in the back seat).  The only problem we have had with this car so far, is the blinkers keep shorting out on it.  I don't know if this is a model wide problem, or our car just doesn't like us.  Overall though, I'd highly recommend this car to a young family.<br><br>
