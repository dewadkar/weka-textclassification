            I have owned my Salsa Red 2000 Dodge Neon for 3.5 years now and it has 98,000 trouble free miles on it.  Its fully loaded with every option in the book (this includes some features not found on cars of this class including traction control and four wheel disc brakes with anti-lock) I love this car.  This is my second Neon (first was a '96) Its fun to drive, looks good doing it and has been the most reliable car I have ever owned.  Its got lots of room inside, the cup holders (4 of them!) are excellent.  Lots of little storage places. Lots of nice little touches too such as the cup holder light and heated mirrors.  There are  few things that annoy me a bit.  The gas tank is too small (12.5 gal) and the rear windows are not power (no Neon ever had power rear windows from the factory).  Those things aside I still love my Neon.  Its my show car too and has won me many awards.
