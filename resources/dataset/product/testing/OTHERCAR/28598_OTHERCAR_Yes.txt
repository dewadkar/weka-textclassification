            I have owned a Jeep since 1975 and I would not own any other off road 
vehicle.I have never stuck my truck and with the short wheelbase it
handles the high peaked dunes and goes on the beach like you are riding
on the highway. I bought the vehicle because I have property that you
must have 4wheel drive to get there. The 304 motor has plenty of power
so you can not be worried about pulling out other trucks and on the road
you can also get on down the street with ease.<br><br>
