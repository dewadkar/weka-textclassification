            My husband and I are not the type to spend lots of money without thinking about it for a long time. In the case of our 4Runner, we first thought about it in 1990. Four years later we finally bought one! Yes, we thought long and hard because it was a lot more money than any other vehicle we had ever owned.

This was the first time we ever leased a vehicle. We leased it through Toyota Motor Credit, and while we were NOT happy with our lease, we LOVED our 4Runner.  When the lease neared the end of its term we thought about getting another 4Runner, first and foremost, but actually ended up keeping the one we originally leased.

The 4Runner sits higher than a car so you get that much more visibility.
There's lots of storage space in the rear. With our two daughters we still have plenty of room for packing all their toys and essentials for weekend trips.  Great for groceries too! When the girls were smaller, it was nice to take to the drive-in theater because we could drop the tailgate and recline in the back of the vehicle.

The only mechanical trouble we've had with our 4Runner was at the end of 1999 (5 1/2 years old now with over 140,000 miles on it). Fortunately for us, the problem was one that was covered under a recall for our year and model. Toyota replaced our engine for us (as well as some related items) and we only paid about $1000! Now, we feel we have a brand new vehicle again. It should easily last another 150,000 to 200,000 miles!
