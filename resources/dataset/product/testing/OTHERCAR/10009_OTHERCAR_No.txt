            I purchased a KIA in November 1997 and it has been in the shop apporximately once a month since then.  The transmission was replaced, air conditioning, wiper fell off, the lining in the trunk fell out, etc.  Now it is in the shop for engince trouble.  The car won't start.  The service on the car is not very good either.  It takes a week or more for a part to be delivered for the car, then days after that to actually get the car fixed.  The new transmission is on the blink again as well.  The car is now only worth $4,000 at best after 2 years.  In 1997 car's MSRP was $12,000 now same car's MSRP is $8,500.  I paid $10,000 at the time for a car with 8,000 miles on it.  The car was a demo and they had to sell it as used because of the milage.

I bought this car as a poor college student who needed transportation.  I knew it wasn't a top of the line car.  I knew there was a possibility for some problems, but not this many.  Not so frequently.  My advice to a person with limited cash who needs a car, don't cheap out.  Buy anything but a KIA.  The car is inexpensive and service is even shabbier.<br>
