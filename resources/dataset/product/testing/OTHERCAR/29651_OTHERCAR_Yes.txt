            After test driving most of the vehicles in this category, the Xterra has to be the true definition of "SUV". I purchased a 2003 XE 2wd Auto, with most of my favorite options. The supercharged SE was a bit too much for the wallet, so I opted for the XE. What impressed me the most was the ride and the lack of road noise. The ride was not too truck-like, but with less body-roll than the competition. The seats felt as if they were made for me. I was able to sit IN them, not ON them. The side bolsters and lumbar support are great.
     The 3.3 V6 engine seems appropriate, considering the 4700 lb weight, but more power would be welcomed. The transmission is silky-smooth, with no gear-hunting on the inclines. 
     I am most impressed with the fit and finish. Most other vehicles I have owned in the past pale in comparison to this vehicle. The doors shut with a solid authority... breaking my stereotype for an "import". Attention to detail abounds throughout this Xterra. The addition of the 12 volt jack inside the armrest, designed just for the cell phone and charger. Well done. 
     Overall, I am overly impressed with the quality and rugged character of this SUV. After driving a Camaro SS for the past 4 years, it is a lesson in quality as well as fit and finish.
