            We purchased our Volvo when I was 4 months pregnant with our second child.  I think we should have waited until our daughter was born because the car shrunk in size.  It is smaller than you think, almost like a sedan.  I have been at the Volvo dealership at least once a month since I have owned the vehicle. (3 years in July) Every little thing that can break does.  For example, the rearview mirror, the automatic window button, the side panels came unglued, the turn signal lights have gone out at least twice a year, the plastic panels under the seat have come undone several times, the hatchback door has broken on the interior at least four times, and the CD player has been replaced.  This is just a small list of the things I have had to deal with.  The car is safe and drives well but I have been too inconvenienced with all these minor details.  I would not buy another and am currently looking for a new car.<br><br>
