            My wife and I have been an owner of a Saturn SL2 for over 3 years now. Overall, we are very satisfied with our ownership experience. We would certainly buy another car from Saturn in the future. Perhaps the recently launched larger sedan though. Before buying our current car we did much research. We narrowed down our choice to the Mazda Protege, Honda Civic and Saturn SL2. Although (at the time of purchase) we thought that the Japanese imports were more refined cars, the Saturn was a 'buy' for us. The insurance and maintenance costs for the Saturn are lower. Our car has been very reliable. Apart from the usual maintenance things, we have only had to replace a driver's seatbelt (our original seatbelt was sent to Saturn headquarters to establish why it had become inoperable) and an alternator (we live in Florida. The humidity causes alternator's to wear out quickly here). We have so far done 81,000 miles! The one thing that we dislike about the car (Saturn has apparently since rectified this) is the engine noise at high revs. Body panels are plastic, therefore dent resistant. We like that. Customer service at Saturn dealers is 1st class. Their waiting areas are like lounges. TV, tropical fish tank, lounge chairs, free newspapers and magazines to read, free gourmet coffee, free doughnuts, free fruit, play area for children with toys to keep them amused. It's great! I don't mind taking our car to the dealer every 3000 miles. Better than the dentist! I wish more companies were as customer friendly as Saturn. The SL series is suitable for a family with small children. The larger sedan would be more suitable for parents with older children.<br><br>
