            I encouraged my father to buy a new luxury car in 2000. I always liked the retro good looks of the E320 combined with modern styling.  I assumed MBenz was worth the $, or at least near it.  I strongly recommend people consider buying less-expensive imports than the MBenz; it leaves much to be desired.  The drive train makes an annoying whine between 55-65mph.  Something is out of balance but the dealer's service dept. &quot;does not hear it.&quot;  The exhaust is loud and overpowers the average quality Bose acoustics.  The driver's cupholder is absolutely pathetic; $10,000 cars have better designed cup holders.  The glove compt. cupholders open and remain on an angle, so every time you hit a bump, your drink is sure to splatter.  Other things to dislike:  lack of chrome moldings and enhancements, hard and stiff interior door grips (hurt your legs), clumsy climate-control system, stupid steering wheel buttons (should be cruise control--not on a separate stalk as cruise is and has been for years on MBenz), cheap carpeting (it's better in my 1990 Honda Accord).  Just plain overpriced.  We thought we'd get much more for our money.  If you need a car to say &quot;look at me,&quot; this is the car for you; I'm more secure than that.<br><br>
