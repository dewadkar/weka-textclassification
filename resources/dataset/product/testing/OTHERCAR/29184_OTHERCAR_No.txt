            Buying the 1999 Neon was a big mistake for me.  The reason I chose this car was the price.  But, as the old saying goes, You get what you pay for.  That saying was right on the money!  But, now I am stuck with this &quot;wannabe&quot; car.  I cannot trade it in, it is not worth nearly close to what I owe on it.
  Leg room?  NOT!  Maybe if you are 4'3&quot; tall.  But, it is my opinion that most people are taller than that.  I do not have documentation to back it up, but I feel pretty sure of it. Also, be sure to look for overdrive in your car.  I thought that OD was pretty much standard in all cars, but I  was wrong.  So, this is not an economy car for me.  I spend more in gas to run the Neon than I do to run my minivan.  I would highly recommend that you do NOT buy this type of car.  Buy yourself a good used vehicle.  You will be much happier in the long run. 
 I must add, the service that I get for my cars at the Dodge dealership is wonderful.  I have never experienced such awesome customer service from any other garage ever!  You will be happy with the service you get, but the product is far from satisfactory.<br><br>
