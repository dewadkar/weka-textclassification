            I purchased my 2001 Lexus IS300 in August of 2000.  Let me tell you from the get-go, I have never been as satisfied with a car as I am with my IS.  For months leading up to that wonderful Saturday in August, 2000, I was constantly doing research on the car, joining newsgroups at my favorite IS300 sites (IS300.net is a really good site to get started), and saving my cash.

Here's a list of IS features that are well worth talking up, or debating:

1.  The Exterior.  
What a wierd, great-looking looking car.  I'm not talking about just the body, but EVERYTHING.  The rims look great.  The low profile wheels add a mean look to the car.  The head lamps are very nice.  Compared to the head lamps on the 3-Series, I think they make a better statement.  If you look close enough, they resemble a cool pair of shades that you might find on baseball player playing left field(Oakleys?).  I know alot of people dont like the rear, and I am kind of on the fence on this one, but I do believe the back of the IS is a strong point.  The clear covers over the brake light are meant to give it personality.  Imagine if it had GS's back side - BORING.  But with the clear brakelamps, and the clever-looking 2 circular brakelights on the trunk can only mean one thing:  IS300.  This car's exterior has a ton of personality.  My car's exterior color is Black, my first choice.

2. The Interior.
I like the interior.  I don't like that there is no arm rest and, on a daily basis, I am reminded that there is no arm rest.  I love the chronograph instrument panel, but I wish there was more to it that the RPM, Speed, MPG, Battery Gauge, and Oil Temp(or is that the Water Temp?) gauges.  Also, the footprint of the instrument panel is quite narrow.  Would be nice if the footprint extended from the door to the console...
The backseat is a sore spot, but not as bad as people make it out to be.  I cannot get in the back seat and be comfortable for longer than 30 minutes.  I'm 6'1" and 200 lbs, so I'm a big guy.  My smaller pals all seem to have no opinion when riding in the back seat, so I guess its ok with them.  
I had my car specially equipped with a 'brushed aluminum' trim that the dealer offered for 1200 bucks.  It covers most of the surface on the console, cup holder cover, on the doors, around the gearbox, instrument panel, etc.  I've been to a couple of car wash specialists and they always rave about it.  So if the dealer offers this package, go for it.  At 1200 bucks, its not cheap.  I bargained with the salesperson; I got mine free because I paid for the car in full.  
The Ascine leather on the seats are VERY NICE.  A good bonus:  no sweating like on other leather seats!  My legs and back stay cool even during long trips.  There is also alot of comfort on the ergonomically correct seats, but may be a bit narrow for some.  At 6'1", 200lbs, I fit just right.

3. Engine
While it doesn't sound like a Porsche 911 or a Viper, one thing it does share with those two is that it sounds distinctive.  Not all cars sound the same, but there are some you can just recognize at the drop of a hat.  Granted, not many people know what a Ferrari f355 or a Lotus Esprit sound like, but to have a car tha sounds unique from the 'everyday' cars, and to package that sound in an 'everyday car' is quite amazing.  Remember the commercials of the IS going thru a muddy road and splashing the awe-stricken media?  Well listen carefully to the sounds of this car.  You'll understand if you don't right now.  
At 215 HP, the IS has some oomph.  I could have used a bit more, especially from the starting line.  But, the car is a bit heavy and I'm not complaining.  
The gas mileage on this car has to be its weakest point.  I drive 80 miles a day and I have to fill up the car at least once a week.  Maybe 20MPG at most.  I live in chicago so the gas prices are MUCH higher than in the rest of the country, so I see 35 dollar fillups all the time.  

Lastly, I've put on over 12,000 miles on this car and twice I had to take it to the dealer.  The first time was because a plastic cover had broken and exposed the wiring of the car.  The dealer wanted to charge me 40 bucks for the part and 250 bucks for labor because 'you ran over something'.  Well, I got out of paying for that by telling him that I didn't run over anything and that it must have been 'wind damage'.(Chicago had experienced 80mph wind gusts in Feb).  I think I duped him, but I don't remember running over anything that BIG to damage the underside of my car.  

The other time was also back in February, and take note of this:  I had to take in the car because of dozens of little tiny paint chippings from rocks.  I've read many times of this happening where the paint on the hood may weak.  The setback was 110 dollars.  I then quickly bought the vinyl bra for the IS for 114 dollars to ensure this never happens again.  So, if buying an IS might be wise to buy the bra for protection.

Well thats it.  Hope this helps.  If you have any questions, please feel free to email me at rd1973@sbc.com.
