            I felt compelled to write about my experience with this car, even though I have since been rid of it for quite some time now. Some nice lady was good enough to run a red light and smash into me and total it for me...Best thing that could have ever happened.

Where should I start with this gem ? At the beginning I suppose. I bought this car used in 1996. It had just come off lease and had 34,000 miles on it..It was nice to look at and was roomy for the kids. Great I thought..Well my pleasure quickly changed to displeasure. Once this baby hit 40,000 miles it was all downhill from there. At 40k the transmission went. Nevermind that it happened the weekend my son was born. I was in labor with no car to drive and my husband had to borrow my father in laws, just so he could get me to the hospital. There I stood 3 days later in the chrysler dealer in the dead of winter with my 3 day old son, waiting for them to diagnose it as if we all didnt already know the trans was shot...I told them to get me a rental car and be quick about it. Thank heavens we spent the $1500 and purchased the extended warranty.What a bargain! Oh speaking of this warranty, everytime I took it into the shop which was often, I had to pay the blasted $100 deductible..some extended warranty!!I called to complaint to Chrysler but they couldnt have given a rats a$$ about any of my problems with this car...they basically said too bad!! Anyway...After a couple hours with my newborn in the dealer, they came out to tell me my trans why shot...no really? I replied...they said it would take a few days. They put in a new trans, and that one failed and they had to do it again! I became quite attached to my rental car at this point and was wishing I could keep that instead! Oh did I mention  that while they were fixing my trans, they informed me the head gasket was blown and the valve covers were leaking also. This is great ..a car with 40k miles with a failed trans and engine leaks and problems...whats next I thought? Well I was soon to find out as the warm weather rolled around...I go to turn on the air, but oddly enough (or not in this case) there was no air coming out...go figure! Back to the dealer I went to have my air fixed..3 different times. The compressor was shot 2 times, and another time they replaced the hoses. I spent more time sweating then I did cool, that is for sure...By the time the air failed a 4th time, I was no longer in warranty and couldnt afford a new compressor...so I sweated..no biggie...

The brakes on this car seemed to need replacement on a constant basis and I just could not figure this out either, although I was not surprised knowing what I knew about this car by then. The valve covers continued to leak, The paint starting chipping, the floor rotting away and by then, like I said above, someone hit me and it died a swift death to the junkyard. What a day, cause I then was able to purchase a Chevy Venture which I drove for 3 years and not once ever, did I have to take it to the shop for anything. Just be warned people, look elsewhere before you even think of buying one of these used gems...
