            I hated this car so much that I only owned it for 12 months.  I bought it used in January of 2002 and by October, the transmission required full replacement, the door seals required replacement due to excessive wind noise, the radio died, the drivers side sliding door fell off on me (yes, I said FELL OFF on me), the electric looks stopped working, and the air conditioning broke.  Although this isn&#146t something that &#147broke&#148, I also hated the fact that it was darn near impossible to get the third seat out by yourself. 

I had a mechanic check it out before we bought it and no problems were found so I&#146m not sure if it was a bad mechanic or the problems just happened quickly and all at once.  I do know that I probably won&#146t ever buy a Dodge again.  

To be fair to the car, we bought it used at a Dodge dealership and I fell in love with it immediately.  I had a 4 week old and I was tired of getting him in and out of a Saturn so I demanded a bigger car.  This was large, roomy, and comfortable and the V6 drove like a dream...until the transmission failed.  It was incredibly easy to get car seats in there and I could comfortably sit 1 car seat and 5 adults with no problems.  The car had 76k miles on it when we bought it and it made several trips from VA to the Outer Banks with no problems.  We could pack the heck out of that car and still have plenty of room left over.  I also liked being able to easily step back into the middle seat to feed my baby if he started to cry.
