            i bought my mazda three years ago, after i wrecked my mustang.  i wasn't too thrilled at the idea of buying it at first, but i had to have a car and the price was right.  since i bought it, it's only been in the shop three times (2 CV boot replacements - remember they are NOT off-road vehicles - and a replacement tune up - the first one used the wrong size spark plugs).  

it gets good gas mileage (about 25 mpg in the city and 35 on the highway), and runs fine on regular unleaded.  personally, i find the automatic seat belts annoying, but i've learned to live with them.  the car is reliable, and is roomy enough to move across three states in (i was amazed that everything fit).  

they're good college cars, or for small families.  mine is an automatic, and my best friend's is a standard, and i like them both.  since it's getting older, it's starting to make the usual older-car groans, but i've never had any major problems with it.  i have almost 100k miles on it, and have never had any major trouble with it.  i do, though, have it serviced regularly, which probably helps.  all in all, i'm happy with my car.     <br><br>
