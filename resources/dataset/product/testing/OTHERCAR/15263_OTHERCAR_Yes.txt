            If you are just starting to do your homework on digital cameras, may I suggest you go take a look at the Sony Mavica product line.  I researched many cameras before I finally made the decision to go with the Sony.

First you'll find that you need to consider all the variables in digital camera's.  Things you'll want to compare include resolution, storage medium, zoom ability, and battery life.  Many cameras come with extra's inlcuding some with the ability to add special effects to the image captured.  Researching these topics led me to conclude that most of the main players in the market provide about the same level of options per price level of camera.  The cost rises about the same in their respective product lines as you increase resolution and zoom. The real difference that made me choose the Sony is that its the only camera that captures the image directly to a regular floppy disk.  No flash memory cards and connectors are necessary to transfer the image files from the camera to the computer.  I was able to take a Kodak digital camera home for a one week trial and what sold me the most on the Sony was this ease of getting the image from the camera to the PC.  With the Kodak I had to set up connectors to attach the flashcards to, and actually had the same issue happen twice during the one week trial where the computer couldn't read the flashcard, so I lost images.

I should also mention that the Sony camera has some additional features like the preview mode that allows you to instantly see the results of your picture taking and delete them right on the camera if you don't like it.  Other cameras don't have the ability to preview and delete the file without moving the memory card to the PC first.  As with every Sony product I have ever owned, I have found the camera to be very reliable, easy to operate and would recommend it to anyone in the digital camera market.<br><br>
