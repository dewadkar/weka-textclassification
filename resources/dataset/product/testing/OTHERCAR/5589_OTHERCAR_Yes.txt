            I thought long and hard before I bought this camera.  I looked through reviews for all cameras within this price range with 2M pixels.  This one consistently came out on top in all reviews.
When I unpacked the camera (and waited patiently for an hour or so for the batteries to charge up) I could almost instinctively use it without reading the instructions, it is designed to be easy to use.
It has different settings for different circumstances (sunset, fireworks, museum) and you can set it to have flash on/off.
For those who are a bit more professional - you can also change the exposure.  And the software which comes with the camera is very good for editing.
It also has a nice little feature where you can take 15s film clips.  They are not of the best quality but it is always handy to be able to film from your camera (especially at the work Christmas party!)
It is small enough to fit in the palm of your hand, I recently went to a music concert, and with the handle tied round my wrist, it felt quite safe, and was at hand to use whenever a photo opportunity came up.  I got some great pictures!
It comes with a 2 rechargeable batteries and a charger.  My advice would be to buy an extra two batteries so that you can always have a charged up set ready to use.
One disappointment is that the memory card that it came with was not really big enough so you will probably have to spend a little extra buying a bigger card.  The only other things I can think of as criticism is that it doesn't come with a camera case, and that it takes a couple of seconds to "wake up" when you first switch on - maybe enough time to miss that photo opportunity?
