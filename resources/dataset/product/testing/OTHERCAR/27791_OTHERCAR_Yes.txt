            Travelling was a pain in the neck! Camera bag was stuffed with my Nikon, film, at least 3 lenses (50mm, wide angle, tele), motor drive, flash, filters, lens caps, etc. The whole package was an impractical impediment to the spirit of vacationing - which was to be free. Introducing the Digital Elph - a perfect, unassuming vacation companion.


Originally, I bought the Elph with the intention of using it in my real estate business but really appreciated it when I took it to the Muskoka's this summer. With my family we went to the Delawanna Inn in Northern Ontario and the camera performed admirably. Simple to use and always handy. The photos are even considerably sharper than my old Nikon (which my friend sold for me while he was in Poland).


I also have a Canon Photura which I use in my work. However, when I publish full color photos taken with each in the local paper, even with the lower resolutions of newsprint, the pictures taken with the Elph really jump out at you. In fact, I'll get more ad calls from the Elph home photos than any others. A coincidence? I'm not taking any chances, so now all my photos are taken with the Elph.


I would highly recommend this camera for its size and performance. When I look back and see the contortions I used to go through just to take lousy photos, I just have to laugh. Certainly, the Elph represents the future of digital photography.    <br><br>
