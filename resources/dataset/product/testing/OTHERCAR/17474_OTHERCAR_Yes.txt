            I have a realistic view about the Sedona.  I do love much about it - mainly the price.  Can't believe I actually got the sticker price of $18,995 on mine!  It's hard to find something so loaded for so little.

The first thing that caught my attention about the Sedona (other than the price) was when I went for my test-drive.  It surprised me with the amount of power in the engine.  I know little about engines and horsepower, but I do know that it had a lot of pep, and for a mini van, that was saying something in my book.

I love all the things everyone else loves about it:  Ample storage, lots of cup holders, extra mobile plugs, on and on and on.  There are a few minor things that irk me, however.  They are:  
1)  Some of the interior details lack integrity.  I had the cupholder replaced immediately because it would not hold it's place.  It then worked great for all of a few weeks when it was back to the way it was.  I never bothered taking it back....guess I need a lot more than that to get me to wait for repairs.
2)  The rear windshield wiper skipped.  They had to replace the arm on it and when I tried it a few days later it continued to skip.  It seems to have gotten better lately though.
3)  One of the rear seats keeps popping out of lock mode.  I just discovered this and it is definitely on my to-do list because I'm not going to have this seat popping up during a minor jolt only to have it brain someone.  Also, as a side note, the front passenger seat had a similar problem latching in when we first got it.  They had a Dicken's of a time getting it worked out but finally did.  They had to replace the whole track below.
4)  Maybe this one is just common for mini-vans.  The Sedona is the first one I've owned, but I do have a problem with the angle the foot has to rest on the gas.  I've tried adjusting my seat and the way I drive, but it's just akward. My leg muscle was sore for awhile but has gotten better.  However, the cramping in my foot has gotten quite intense at times.  

If I were in the market for a new mini van, I might consider another Sedona if they fixed a few of the integrity issues and did a few design modifications.  One main one I'd like to see is for the seats to be 100% interchangeable on an individual basis.  I would like the 2nd row seats to be able to be separated or put together depending on the needs of the moment.  Adding a car seat and then trying to gain access to the back is hard when your elderly relative has to have the seat closer to the door for easier access.
