            I leased my MBZ C280 right before we got pregnant.  I was driving a Jeep Wrangler at the time, and knew we needed more of a family car, with 4 doors!  Safety was also a big issue with me.  So, we looked at the Mercedes.  I loved it.  I loved the car's ride, and especially how fast it could go! LOL!  I always wanted to be one of those people that flew by everyone getting on the freeway, or starting up from a red light and leaving everyone else behind in the dust.  Well, those weren't the only reasons why I picked this car, but they were the fun reasons.  When I drive with my 17 month old in this car, I feel very safe.
Another cool feature is when it's really cold outside, and I have to run into the store, I press a button, and it will maintain the heat inside the car while I am in the store.  So, when I get back into the car, it's still warm and toasty inside. It also comes with all the things that most cars have as options, like the CD disk changer in the trunk and built in car phone with hands free. I could list a bunch of cool features it has, but just let me leave it at that.
There is one downside to this car, and it's only a downside for me, and may not be for others.  It's too small for me.  I plan to have more children, and right now there's just enough trunk space for a stroller and booster seat. When I go grocery shopping or to the mall (and I could come home with a lot there!), I have to pile everything on the side of my baby, because nothing else fits in the trunk.  I also feel sorry for anyone who has to sit in the back.  With the car seat in the middle, it doesn't leave any room at all for passengers on the side.
So, for someone who's looking for a great, reliable, luxury car, this is the one!<br><br>
