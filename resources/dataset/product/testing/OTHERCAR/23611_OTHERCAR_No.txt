            To keep or not to keep this car, that is the question.  We own a 1993 Dodge Intrepid.  When we first got this car, I loved it.  For the past two years or so...I can't stand the thing.  We have had multiple problems with the car.  Beware of electrical problems.  I have family members who have Dodge Intrepids and are/have experienced these same problems.  It gets annoying when your windshield wipers come on and won't go off.  Or when eventually all the electric windows won't go up/down.  God forbid should you have to get the rear window replaced.  Be prepared to fork out some major money.

Outside of the problems we've encountered, this car has potential to be a wonderful auto.  It drives wonderful, decent gas milage, and offers a smooth ride.

Just hope yours isn't one of the ones that ends up with these problems listed above.  <br><br>
