            I got my AGFA ePhoto Smile for free through one of PlanetJam's auctions.  I am very glad that I didn't spend any money for it.  I am a little disappointed that I even wasted my time to get points and bid on it.

Obviously I didn't expect great picture quality form a $90 camera.  But I at least expected mediocre quality.  The pictures that I have taken with the Smile are extremely grainy, and the lighting is awful.  It does have some features that you wouldn't expect on such a cheap camera (tv viewing, webcamera capable), but the quality is worse than a 1970's Polaroid.

The software that is included is good for beginner users.  The only accessory that isn't included is a dc power source, which would come in handy for webcam use.  The battery life is pretty bad as well.

The camera has a resolution of 640x480, which is misleading because the pictures are always fuzzy, with blurred edges(lines in the image are not sharp).  It can store 16 images at a time, which is not bad for the price, but there is no way to upgrade this, so you would definitely not want to take this on a trip.  The camera transfers images to the PC through serial interface which is inherently slow.

I wouldn't recommend this camera.  It is not worth spending $90 bucks for a crappy camera, save your money and go for a low-end Olympus like the D-360 (1280x960, 1.3 mega-pixel, auto focus, 2x zoom, smart-media).
