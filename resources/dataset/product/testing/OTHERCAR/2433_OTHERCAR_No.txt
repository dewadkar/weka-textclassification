            Way back in 1988 when Ms scmrak and I bought our (first) Toyota pickup truck, I though long and hard about buying the earliest version of the Mitsubishi Montero (also marketed as the Dodge Raider). We even test drove one of them -- a sort of crude, boxy little thing; built (if I remember rightly) on the frame of an ordinary Mitsu pickup. We bought the Toyota instead, and the rest is history. I hadn't given much thought to the Montero since, except to look briefly at a Montero Sport when shopping for our second truck in '99 (history repeated itself: a second Toyota). So, the first thing that I noticed when I clambered into a rented Montero XLS for another trip to Houston was "My, how you've grown! Did you stop in at McDonalds and get super-sized?!"


<b>The Bigger is Better Question - Again</b>

The Montero no longer numbers among the "small SUV's." Heck, even the smaller Montero Sport is significantly larger than the model I drove back in that dawn of time era! Today's version stands six feet tall and almost sixteen feet long, and has bulked up to some 4600 pounds; making it comparable in size to Chevy's Tahoe or Ford's Expedition. It seats five comfortably, plus another two less comfortably in a folding third seat that hides under the floor for expanded cargo room. 

The interior is roomy: forty-one-plus inches of headroom for the driver might have given Hoss Cartwright room to wear that fifteen-gallon cowboy hat! There's so much glass in the passenger compartment it almost feels as if you're in an atrium. And elbow- and leg-room are also abundant, even in a second row of seats where adults can sit comfortably without worrying about locked knees. That seating's relatively comfortable, too: the XLS model's driver seat gives good support and reasonably good adjustability, plus easy access to controls. The (more expensive) Limited trim line adds a six-way power adjustable seat and an optional power-adjustable passenger seat.


<b>Body Talk</b>

A longish four-door cruiser, the Montero boasts tall entry and exit, with a fifth door on the rear. The right-hand-hinged rear door is a departure from most other SUVs in the class, being more similar to the smallest of the breed (RAV-4, CR-V) than to the tailgate-equipped Expedition or Tahoe. Seen from the exterior, the Montero's styling is also different from that of the competition. The traditional boxy SUV profile is modified by bulges on the front fenders, and ornate plastic cladding on the sides that wraps around to the rear. An exterior-mounted spare tire is stashed inside a color-keyed hard shell, freeing up valuable interior space. The gingerbread trimming -- fender bulges and bumper bumps, ridged cladding -- becomes little much for my tastes, almost baroque in the level of ornamentation.

The interior is best described as <I>BIG</I>. It's roomy, but well-laid out for the most part, with not one but two glove boxes, a dual-space console with sliding top, and the usual array of door pockets, seat-back pockets, and dashboard nooks. A few complaints involve the near-invisible location of the fuel-filler release, vastly undersized fuel and temperature gauges (the 4WD indicator is twice the size of the gas gauge!), and cheesy construction of the console unit.

The second-row seats are split 60:40, and either side tumbles to allow access to the rear seat. That rear seat, by the way, is minuscule - don't even threaten to put adults in there! Stowing the third seat won't take an engineering degree, but it's also not a one-touch operation. You have to slide three separate tabs in precise order, otherwise the assembly refuses to disappear gracefully.


<b>Notes From Behind the Wheel</b>

There's one drive-train option for the XLS version: a 3.5-liter V6 engine rated 200 hp and a 4-speed automatic transmission with an electronic brain. Those who opt for a Limited version get the same engine matched to a Sportronic" 5-speed automatic transmission. 

I found the brain in the standard tranny to be on the stupid side; skittering from gear to gear when I punched the accelerator, especially when trying to grab a little reserve power for freeway merges and the like. Perhaps it's because the 200-hp engine had a tough time pushing around all that mass - this is a pretty big vehicle for that relatively small engine. Standing starts find you winding the Montero out to 4500 RPM to keep up with even Honda Civics; pedal to the metal on the streets almost always results in a double downshift and a howling power plant. Acceleration at freeway speeds is most kindly described as "lethargic," one might be more inclined to say "tortoise-like."

Though Mitsubishi has upgraded the size of the Montero over the past 15 years, they've not done a whole lot with the ride. It remains decidedly harsh and truck-like, pitching and yawing with each road irregularity. Small bumps resonate through the frame, rattling the body and passengers alike and emitting a loud "clunk." A 37.4-foot turning circle (smaller than the 40 feet needed by a PT Cruiser with 16-inch wheels!) gives the Montero good low-speed handling and maneuverability in parking lots. That maneuverability is, of course, offset by its mammoth size.

It's at road speeds though, where the Montero's handling is at its worst. Turns have a marked "tippy" feel and there's noticeable plow when maneuvering. Braking is likewise somewhat adventuresome, with the front end dipping severely under hard braking. The Montero's top-heavy driving has caught the attention of at least one major testing facility: Consumer Reports has rated the 2001 model unsafe due to a tipping hazard. Mitsubishi denies this allegation, but actions speak louder than words: the suspension is being reworked for the 2003 version. 


<b>This and That</b>

<i>Safety</i> -- dual front passenger airbags plus side airbags are standard; as are antilock brakes. The XLS has driver-controlled part-time four-wheel drive for rough or slippery roads; the Limited has a full-time  electronically controlled system to distribute traction between rear or rear and front wheels as needed. There are the usual LATCH points and child-safety locks.

<i>Amenities</i> -- Standard power windows & mirrors, remote keyless entry, AM/FM/Cassette/CD, cruise control, A/C, and tilt steering. Climate control is average (well, at least the A/C), and I found the stock sound system to deliver below average sound. It's also poorly designed, and the panel has too much glare to read easily. XLS options include rear A/C and powered seats. The Limited version has standard heated power seats, sunroof, heated side-view mirrors, and leather seating.

<i>Fuel Economy</i> -- First the good news: the EPA rates the Montero at 14 City and 17 Highway (I got about 16.5 for 400+ miles) -- respectable for the breed. Now the bad news: Mitsubishi recommends premium fuel (91 octane) for their V6, amounting to, what, 20 additional cents per gallon at the pump? Bad Mitsu, bad!

<i>Noise</i> -- Engine noise is harsh on acceleration but acceptable at cruising speed. Wind noise is intrusive at speed, however, and road noise is also intrusive on any but the smoothest surfaces. 

<i>Construction</i> -- Generally acceptable fit and finish, except: driver's door and passenger door fit poorly. Materials used in construction lightweight -- doors closed with a tinny sound, and plastic cladding was standing up poorly after less than 10K miles.



<b>Rating the Montero</b>

As configured, I think the 2002 model is clearly inferior to the Ford Expedition: top-heavy handling, lackadaisical acceleration, and the need for premium fuel all take their toll. On some fronts -- interior design, the stowable third seat, maneuverability (low-speed) -- the Montero stands out. Professional reviewers also prefer the Montero's offroad handling (I didn't try it). However, the maximum towing capability (5000 pounds) is substantially below that of the Expedition. 

To stay viable in a highly competitive market, Mitsubishi needs to look long and hard at the Montero. Although just redesigned in 2001, the Montero needs more work. At the very least, a redesigned suspension system is necessary to alleviate rollover fears and smooth out its truck-like ride. A supercharged version of the V6 or, better yet, a V8 (that uses regular fuel) is also a necessity. And, if you please, get rid of some of those frilly body design elements -- it's the Victorian gingerbread of the automotive industry!
