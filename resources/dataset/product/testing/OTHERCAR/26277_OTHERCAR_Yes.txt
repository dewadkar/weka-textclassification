            This is a very good car for a small family. The honda civic is and always has been a very reliable car. This car is stylish looking and can be customized with many available accessories to make the car very sporty looking. This car is also very good on fuel economy, it handles well, and is a comfortable car to drive on long road trips. The car comes with power door locks and windows and also has a power moonroof with tilt and power mirrors which are all standard features. One other standard feature which is a nice feature is the keyless entry system which can include a security system at an additional cost. The audio system has a cd player with 6 high power speakers and a cd changer can also be added at an additional cost. This vehicle also comes with A/C and cruise control which are two more standard features included. So as you can see you get allot of standard features for one small price which the sticker price on my car with a five speed transmission was a good price for all the standard equipment.   <br><br>
