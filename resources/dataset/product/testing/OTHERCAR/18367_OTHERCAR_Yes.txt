            Good looking van with very smooth ride.  I have a 1999 Villager with the following options: a/c, pb, pw, pl, ps, cd player.  The van looks really good and drives super.  Gas mileage could be a little better, but not bad for a van which weighs in at around 4,000 lbs (17 city  25 highway).  My one complaint is the seats. Also not enough color options for seats, only two colors to choose from.  They are somewhat hard to sit in.  Not as comfortable as my Merc. sable.  All in all there is a good amount of room for a van that looks so little.  The adjustable seating is nice and not very hard to reconfigure.  Cargo net and shelf are nice options.  V-6 motor is smooth and pulls the van along with out any problems,  goes up hills with ease, even loaded down with passengers and cargo.  <br><br>
