            I am a first time user of a digital camera. I got a HP C200 and it is a great camera.  
I bought a digital camera because I am short on patience I wanted to see my pictures now, not wait until they were developed just to find out that some of them didn't turn out the way I wanted them to.

I couldn't believe how easy this camera is to use. 
The pictures are great and they print out beautifully even on my cheap little printer. 
Hewlett Packard even has a web site to help you out if you need it.

I love this camera!
The package I got came with everything I needed, even a AC adapter plus batteries.
I haven't found anything I don't like about it yet.
This is a great camera for the first time user or anybody that wants a great inexpensive digital camera<br><br>
