            My dad first bought the ES300 in the summer of 1994. Actually, he leased it for 3 years.

<b> First Impression... </b>
At that time, I thought that this car looked great. The exterior styling was excellent. When we went to pick up the car, I had the pleasure of sitting in the passenger seat. The first thing that caught my attention was the softness and plushness of the leather seats. What I really like about Lexus's (my family now owns 2 LS400's) is the soft and powdery leather seats. You could definitely <b>LIVE</b> in these seats. They are really really comfortable. I then glanced at the instrument panel and audio controls. It seemed that it was meticulously designed, that a lot of attention was gone into detailing the interior.

<b> On the road </b>
So... my dad started driving. The engine is unbelievably quiet. You can barely hear the hum of the inline6 under the hood. The cabin is even more quiet, making a perfect ambience for listening to music. I sat back and enjoyed the ride. The suspension is very soft... You can barely feel bumps and potholes while speeding along the highway.

<b> Long term </b>
After 2 years, this car was still driving like it was new. The only compliant i have is that the leather seats begin to lose it's plushness, softness, and powderiness. It starts to harden up and lines show up. But, you can't complain much since it's normal wear and tear. My dad moved to the west coast after 2.5 years of driving this car, thus i had the pleasure of driving this car for half a year. In addition, my loved this car so much, when he moved to california, he bought 2 Lexus LS400's.

<b> My take </b>
After 2.5 years of service to my dad, I got to drive this car for a winter. The first time i drove this car, was actually the first time i ever drove any car (when i had my learning permit). It was the first car i had ever drove. In my mind, the Lexus ES300 is definitely worth the $32000 price tag. It is decently quick, very comfortable, very quiet, and the suspension is excellent. Lexus is undoubtedly true to it's slogan... the pursuit of perfection.<br><br>
