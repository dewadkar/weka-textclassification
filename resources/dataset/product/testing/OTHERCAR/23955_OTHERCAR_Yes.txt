            First let me start out saying that I am a casual camera user- the most techical thing I've done with any camera is use the red-eye reduction.  I can't tell you anything techical about the specifications of this camera like some of the other reviewers but if you want a good digital camera that is easy to use and gives you great pictures to share with others then this is it.
We went to Ritz camera to buy the Canon A70 and the salesperson convinced us that this was the better camera for the price range we were looking.  After playing with it for 30 sec I knew I liked the way it felt and operated.  There is a "bump" on the left side of this camera (which you can see in the photo) that fits nicely into the palm of my hand which makes it feel steady and secure while snapping pictures.  The menus are super easy to navigate through with a press of a button.  And to review photos, just press a button... with the option to view all stored photos as a slideshow.  Great feature there!  It has a 3x optical zoom and 2x digital zoom (that kicks in automatically after the optical zoom has reached it's limit).  The buttons for these are located right where your thumb would rest naturally, unlike some cameras where they are hard to find without looking for them.  The wheel on top of the camera is where you make your selections such as movie mode, manual, automatic, and also has some other options such as portrait mode which outlines a head and body for you to line your subject in for those of us who like to cut heads off.  There are also modes for taking pictures of scenery or night photos.  Plus 10 other modes accessed through the menu button all for taking the perfect photo that I'm sure I'll never use: backlight (for shadows), copy (for taking pictures of print), fireworks, museum, close up, night, dusk/ dawn, sunset, beach, party/ indoor.  There are so many options to help you take the perfect photo that it would be hard to get it wrong.  Although, as I said before, I'm not that kind of camera user so I'm sure these functions will never get used but it's nice to know they are there.  It just seems like it would take too long to scroll through all these option just to take a handful of photos.  But if I'm ever in a museum and want to take a picture I might try it out...  One feature I think I will use is the cropping and editing- right in the camera!  You can even do back and white and sepia. Another really great feature is the automatic shut-off.  I can't tell you how many batteries I have drained b/c of lack of this feature in other camera.
Once you've taken your photos, they are so easy to download.  Just hook up the USB cord (included) to the USB port and there they are.  It comes with software to download and store the pictures but I didn't install it.  I just use the general media products that were already on my computer- it's fast and easy so why mess with a decent thing.
In the movie mode, you can take up to 40 sec mini-films that you can even edit.  I haven't tried that but I'm sure that's something I will be using while I'm waiting for my 8 mo old to do something exciting for me to film.  No sound though, that was a drawback but we were buying a camera not a camcorder so it wasn't a deciding factor.
The negatives with this camera is the 16 mb card it comes with is pretty useless unless you can download your pictures after 17 shots.  You need to invest in at least a 32mb card immediately.  Also, the red- eye reduction, the one feature I use regularly, doesn't work all that great.  The lag time between photos is significant.  But I think it is in most digital camera.  Just something to get used to from a standard camera.
Overall, this is a lightweight, easy to use camera that will give you good looking pictures.  Just invest in a good photo or photo-quality printer and you'll have your pictures in no time flat.
