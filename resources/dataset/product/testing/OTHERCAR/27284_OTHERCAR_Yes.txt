            Bought a 2000 Durango SLT 2 months ago, and feel that it is the best decision I have made. Needed something to tote the wife and kids around in, tow our meddly of toys and still have some driving fun left.
My model is the SLT Plus, with all the bells and whistles, including the 5.9L V8 and 4x4. 
Pros:
Handling, comfort and style far exceed any competitor. It handles like the best of cars, is as comfortable as the largest SUVs and has more style in one door than the Ford Explorer has in entirety.
Turns amazingly well, the U-Turn capability is better than most cars. Very nimble also. The power leather seat (driver only) is perfect for the long haul (I drive 3,000 miles a month, so this was a priority!) The passenger and rear bench seats are also as comfortable, although I only relegate Children to the 3rd seat in back - a lack of ample leg room.
Can tow 7,000+ and still use the passing lane, loaded with passengers and cargo too! The Infinity stereo is second to none for factory installed music systems. The stance is pretty good for light off-road work, although a little more lift - just 2&quot; - would have been nice right out of the factory. In the dunes it is great!
Jamming corners full speed invites NO roll - in fact you can feel the front wheels kicking in giving extra traction. Aside form the 2&quot; extra lift which would have been nice, the tires and wheels from factory are sufficient.
Cons:
Gas. Man, at 14MPG combined, keep your wallet handy. But what can you expect? A huge engine and payload tends to hit the gas tank hard. Adding a good aftermarket hi-flow air filter system and cat-back exhaust really improves MPG and HP.

Suggestions:
If you do not do extensive towing or off-roading, stick with the smaller V8s. You do not need that extra power, and the 5.9L only gets about 5HP and 15torque gains. If you tow alot and need to haul passengers - go get a Durango!!!

This truck makes the Explorer look like a toy. The Tahoe (which was my previous tow master) too large with nothing to gain. All in all, if you actually need an SUV, this is the one!

(Great aftermarket items available for those who want to really offroad!)
