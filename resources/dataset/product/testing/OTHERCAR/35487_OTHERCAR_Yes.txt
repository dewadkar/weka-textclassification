            We were looking for a second vehicle to use for family hauling. Long trips were not so comfy in our SAAB 900 and it only had four seats. With baby number two on the way we thought it was time to add to our fleet.

I read tons of online reviews and concluded that the Toyota Sienna, Ford Windstar and Honda Odyssey EX were the best choices and although the Honda was the cheapest, it was also the hardest to find.

This van has all the comfort of a luxury car without all the fluff. Power windows, cruise control, CD stereo, Climate control AC/heater for the front and a separate one in the back. Reading lights are individually controlled over each seat. Headroom abounds and the center table between the two front seats is great for those drive thru meals. 2 12volt dc lighter plugs are included, one at the base of the front console, ideal for cell phones or laptops on the center tray, and another in the cargo area which I use for a KoolMate refrigerator on long trips.

The best feature of this vehicle is its versatility. The center seats slide forward or back to customize legroom and can also be joined as a bench or separate or removed individually. The rear bench seat folds into a well in the cargo area creating a flat load floor.

This vehicle doesn't get left behind at any stop lights either as the V6 pushes it cleanly off the line. It also includes mud and snow rated tires with traction control combined with front wheel drive and ABS braking for a very sure grip on the road.

The hardest thing to get used to in this car is parking. As with most modern body styles the aerodynamic hood slopes completely out of view making it hard to negotiate tight corners in parking garages and such. It took me about a month to be able to park it straight into a standard space. ( I think the curve of the windscreen combined with the lack of hood reference conspired against me here.

We get about 21 miles per gallon in mixed hwy and city driving. The fuel gauge is a little weird though as the first 100 miles after a fillup go by with little movement and then it drops rapidly to about 3/4 of a tank. The remote control power side doors are pretty cool allowing our son to get into the car even when his folks are still ten paces behind. You can also lock it from a fair distance away by remote. One other quirk is the power recliner switch on the driver's seat. My wife and I thought we were going nuts for a while until we realized that we were hitting this switch everytime we got in and out of the vehicle. The seat kept reclining mysteriously until we realized this. Honda needs to put a small ridge above the switch to prevent this.

Overall we really love this van and have already racked up 9000 miles since sept 99. We ended up looking at lots of dealers trying to find an available van, but it was worth the wait of a few weeks. We paid retail but have heard some retailers are asking 1k to 5k over retail. I recommend finding a dealer who will sell it to you at retail and waiting on a list. Car values crash fast enough without giving a price premium as well.
