            I have an 89 Sentra XE and it is the most comfortable and reliable car I have ever driven.  I have had it for 3 years now without a single glitch!  I know someone that had a Multi van that lasted just past 350,000 kilometers (220,000 miles)!!  The back seat would be my only complaint - it is REALLY small!  Anyone over 5 feet tall has to adjust their neck to be able to sit.  The front, on the other hand, has plenty of room and the seats have perfect back support.

The only problem I had with this car is that I had to buy it from a Nissan dealer - and they leave alot to be desired! <br><br>
