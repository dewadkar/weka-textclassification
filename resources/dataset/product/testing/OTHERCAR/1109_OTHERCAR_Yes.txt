            I got this car when i turned 16, because it was just sitting around not being used cause my mom had just bought a Tahoe.  At first i was like.....id rather have a car....but the more i drove it, the more i love it.  I named my car the flying bear, so ill be reffering to my particular suburban as such in the review.

Ill start off with the pros:
ENGINE/POWER:
Im not sure how much HP the Flying Bear has...i think its somehwere around 220.  And it shows.  The engine is large and powerful.  I think i screwed up the transmission, becase i would stop the car, then floor it to hear the engine growl.  And growl it does.  At about 20 or 30 mph, the engine really kicks in and starts roaring.  Its a very very impressive sound.  I figured out it goes 0-60 in about 10 seconds.  Cars ive outrun in the flying bear include: Acura Integra(i dont konw the year), Toyota 4Runner(1991), Honda Accord(2000 I think), and like a 96 Jeep Cherokee.  Now I know the suburban is by no means a sports car, but konwing that power makes you feel warm inside.  And since your probably gonna buy a suburban for something other than "street racing", your probably more concerned with the other aspects...

DURABILITY
Our family got the suburban in, I'd say 1996.  We've taken it on road trips to Washington DC and to San Francisco, and therefor, it has about 186,000 miles on it.  The car runs absolutely perfectly.  The only problems I can remember us having is the recent event of the transmission dying.  In fact, the transmission was supposed to go out at about 100k miles.  So the suburban is gonna be with you for a while.

COMFORT
My suburban has cloth seats.  And they are very very comfortable.  I slept in the car one night, and it was a very good night's sleep, even in the driver's seat.  The drivers seat is customizable in just about every respect.  You can put it up, down, forward, back, leaned forward, and leaned back, making it perfect for anyone of any size.  And theres a tall cieling making for excellent headroom.  Im 6'2", and sitting in the driver's seat is a very comfortable experience.  The only thing thats less than perfect is getting my legs under teh steering wheel, which is also adjustable.  I just like it as low as it will go so it feels like im driving a car.  The 2nd row seats have extensive leg room also.  Sitting in the 2nd row seats is very comfortable as well.  3rd row seating is a bit cramped however.  Full size adults would have trouble cramming into the 3rd row bench.  All rows in the suburban have good headroom.

If your planning on buying a suburban for lugging stuff around, then look no further.  Whether its a family or building materials, the suburban is perfect.  Our family has 2 suburbans, The Flying Bear, and my dad's suburban.  Mine is more of a family suburban, while my dads is more of a utility suburban.  Mine has 2nd row bucket seats, and a 3rd row bench.  The bench is removeable for carrying larger objects, and the bucket seats compact for additional room.  My dad's suburban has 3 benches.  The 3rd is removable, and the 2nd compacts flat for carrying things like building materials, large boxes, and so on.  Since my suburban is more people than utility oriented, it has more featuers, like dome lights, more extensive 2nd row AC/Heating, and pockets.  

Some drawbacks to the suburban is that, well, its like driving a cruise ship it seems like sometimes.  Manuvering around a parking lot or a complicated street system takes some finesse.  My friend owns a 91 4runner, and when we go in seperate cars, and he has to turn around, he just turns in an intersection.  I have to turn about 3/4 of the way, then go into reverse, back up into one of the streets, and then finish the other 1/4 of the turn.  In parking lots, you sometimes have to get as far away from the side your going to park on as possible to pull off parking in the desired spot.  I didnt do this once, and scratched another car pretty bad, and had about an inch of room.  So going from a car to a suburban might take some getting used to.  But once you get it down, its no big deal.  Also, the gas mileage could be better, but its not the worst.  I have to refill the tank completely about once every 2 weeks or so.
