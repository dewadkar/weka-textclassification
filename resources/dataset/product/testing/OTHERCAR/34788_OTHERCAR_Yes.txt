            Going through the terrain of mountainous Northern New Jersey and New York can be tough. A forest escapade or a snowy downfall may give problems to the best of sedans and many sport utilities. This vehicle certainly does not. 

I typically am not a Mitsubishi fan under many circumstances, but this is a definite exception.

This is the basis of the Montero Sport for your information:

If you are not into the specs, sorry about that, I felt it was a necessary reference for this type of vehicle.

Now a more down-to-Earth opinion. I shall begin with performance.

This has plenty of power. With a 3 liter V6 engine and 173 horsepower, this thing can really zip for its size. Comparing it to sedans and roadsters, it is surprisingly agile. The handling is perfect. It is just how I would have it if I had a custom made race car for myself. It hugs curves better than any large vehicle I have driven.

Now looks. This is more subjective, and you can look at pictures for yourself, but allow me to analyze. For starters, be aware that its appearance has changed drastically since 1999. The front grille and lights are quite different, and give it a nicer, more muscular look, which also fades better into the fenders.

If you get an SUV for practical purposes or just because the nieghbors have one, (which is very common these days), get this one. It is average-priced, and one of the few SUVs which I feel are worth the pricetag. Also the gas mileage at 17/20 is reasonable in the current state of high gas prices. 

Look for service and other updates in the future.<br><br>
