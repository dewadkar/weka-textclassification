              Hello again, your friendly German Auto Tech. with some under the hood things about Mercedes Benz. The 400E has great speed &amp; power, is balanced perfectly to lend handling to the powerful engine, and looks great, too.
  However, the car is plagued with typical MB problems. There are &quot;mystery leaks&quot; and the A/C doesn't last very long. The A/C compressor is Nippondenso and is good quality, the parts are the same quality as any auto maker. Almost all the repairs we make where I work is one A/C system after another! BMW A/C doesn't have this problem. There are also leaks. The engine has 70,000 to 100,000 miles worth of oil and grim which make it hard to spot leaks, and after you clean them fluids still go down but the grim doesn't change.
  Typical leaks on these are the cam cover seals and the VC gasket if not replaced regularly, behind the #5 cylinder at the head gasket, the steering gearbox, the P/S pump hoses, front cover gasket.
  If its fast you want, then its fast you'll get! If its reliable transportation you're after, may I suggest a nice 300E or 190E, of coarse the D version is fine, too.<br><br>
