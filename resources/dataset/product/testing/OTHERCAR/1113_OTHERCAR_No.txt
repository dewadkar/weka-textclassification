            With a 200 Neon you get what you pay for.  Sort of because all cars are over priced, if you ask me!

We bought our 2000 Neon in 99, when they first came out, and have driven 140,000 hard miles on it with no bills other than oil changes and tires.  We paid $15,000 for the car minus our worthless trade in that they claimed to give us $4,000 for.  For an $11,000 new car, it has not been so bad. 

The Neon handles well and is a fun car to drive.  It does well and does not make any funny noises on curves.  It actually handles extremely well on gravel roads and I drive fast down them, 45-55 mph.  If you have ever been on a gravel road, you know that is pushing it but this little car handles well.

It has enough pick-up for a little engine and provides a fairly smooth ride.  I easily pass other cars and can safely pull out of a busy store into traffic.  It shifts smoothly and does not rev the engine too high like the last car we had.

It even neatly fits into the new sub-compact parking spaces you seem to encounter everywhere.

The front seats are comfortable enough to not paralyze a person after a 650 mile drive.  I have never received a complaint from the back seat, which a person who is 5'9" or shorter will fit comfortably in.  This is a big plus for people who drive great distances.

Breaking is good and we have yet to replace brakes.  I drive fast and stop suddenly, so I figure they must have been made to last.  The break petal is not too touchy, like some others, but is easy to apply unlike our non-automatic older car!

If you buy one make sure it has been maintained.  Those little engines cannot take running out of or low on oil. 

Be prepared to not have conversations because the wind noise is terrible and increases as the seals wear.  I had the seals replaced in this car when it was new 5 times but the air noise would not go away.  It is just the car. 
 
When buying a new car, Chrysler does a lot to keep customers happy.  Our dealer in Pekin Illinois was wonderful and went out of his way to make us happy.  Customer service was also awesome and answered every problem.

This car has gone a long ways on little money.  The first set of tires wore out in 20,000 miles.  Probably because we live on a gravel road.  The new tires have lasted a little longer but never as long as they say.  That is another problem.

We test drove several cars and did not find another in this class with the room, except a Mazda Protegee, but it was about $5,000 more, so we chose the Neon.  There is plenty of leg room for average sized people in the back but if you are on the tall side, forget it.  The leg room in the front is huge and the trunk is a nice size with a fold down back seat.   The room in this car is amazing because it looks so little from the outside.  Inside, it is the same size as a mid-size car but for a small car price.  I can easily fit 5 - 50# dog food bags in the trunk.

So, if you can live with the air noise, go for it.  This car is a value.  The radio is good enough to overcome the noise and easy enough to operate.  Once you know the car, the control become second nature.  

The heater is quick and hot.  This car stays outside in the country where the wind is ruthless.  It usually only takes about 8 miles to full heat on the coldest winter days, start and go.  In the summer it takes about 6 miles to really cool off and in 10 miles you could store fresh milk.

We have changed the oil every 4,000 miles or so.  The book suggests every 5,000.  That is all we have done, except the transmission fluid at about 115,000 and that was expensive.  The fluid itself cost about $75.00.  Wow!  It is $2. at Wal-Mart but this car takes a different kind! 
 
We plan on running the car until it won't run any more because mileage is good, generally 35 mph but sometimes 40+ .  It depends on how fast I drive.  The gas tank only holds 10 gallons though and it seems like you are always adding fuel if you drive a lot!

I would encourage anyone needing a work car or on a budget to buy this car but alway beware of buying used and make sure you know the history of the vehicle!

UPDATED INFORMATION:

I am sorry to say this car was totaled with 170,000 miles on it.  I never had a single mechanical problem with this car and it required little maintence.

The bad news is that in an accident in town, 1 car going 30 mph (ME) and another slowing and going at a stop sign, the car was totaled.  The frame was compacted, it leaked radiator and steering fluids, the hole front end was pushed in, even the side where there was only 10% of the impact.  My son and I had concusions.  This is a POOR car in such a situation!
