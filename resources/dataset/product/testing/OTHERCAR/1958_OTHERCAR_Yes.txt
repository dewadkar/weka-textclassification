            As 21 year old, who is on his fourth car, I would consider myself extremely lucky to have found the great car that is the Nissan Maxima.  Unfortunatly I only had enough to buy a 1989 Maxima.  I was lucky though, I got the five speed with the potent 3.0 liter V6.  After over ten years of use and 100,000 miles this car feels as though I just drove it off the lot.  At 120 miles per hour this car acts like it is still in the parking lot.  Pin point steering and unbelivable handling make this car one of the best buys of the century!  Seriously, these Maxima's last and perform far beyond their years.  By the time other cars are being cashed in for a hundred bucks, your still driving your Maxima around with the mindset that you could get five to six grand for it.  This is what keeps you a Nissan buyer.  People might think that i am a little bit over the edge about Maxima's, but I am dead serious about this car.  I will leave onn the note that this car is the best car in the world if you are looking for performance, power, and low price in an automobile.<br><br>
