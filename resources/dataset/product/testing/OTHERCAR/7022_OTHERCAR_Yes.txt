            I was shopping for a Thunderbird, and spotted a Lincoln Mark VII on the dealer's lot.  At first, I thought I could not afford it, so why bother.  To my surprise, it is very affordable and just what I needed.  I have owned several types of vehicles in my life, and this is undoubtedly the best!

Gliding on air down the highway is an accurate description, and the way it handles in city traffic is incredible.  All options imaginable on a luxury vehicle are within your reach with a Mark VIII.  

Gas mileage averages 28 hwy/22 city, not expected with the size of the vehicle.  I was skeptical about purchasing a two door car, however, this auto proved that wrong as the interior is very roomy and extremely comfortable.

If you are searching for an affordable luxury car, excellent mpg, roomy 2 door, not to mention very classy, this is the automobile for you.  The trunk holds an enormous amount of bulky items, a bonus!  

If you think you can't afford a Lincoln Mark VIII, check out the price and you will find you will definitely get your money's worth.<br><br>
