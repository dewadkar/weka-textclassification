            Well, after waiting for a few years, I finally got into the digital camera scene. I had been waiting for a digital camera to come out that would be able to fulfill my &quot;demands&quot; for the ideal digital camera. I wanted a product that produced excellent quality photos, had available lens attachments, and was affordable. Well the CoolPix 800 meets those expectations and surpasses them in many ways.

     I desired a product that would allow me to take photos that just didn't look digital. I know that sounds awkward, but you know what I'm talking about: those old grainy photos that old digital cameras boasted were &quot;near photo quality.&quot; Well, I wanted none of that. I needed something that would produce photo quality photos. Well, I must say that the CoolPix certainly meets this requirement. Without getting too much into the technical aspect of it, the 2 MegaPixel (1600x1200 - it really doesn't add up to 2 megapixels, but that's how they distinguish from lower end cameras) aspect of the 800 really yields amazing photographs. Opening them up in a photo editor such as Photoshop allows you to see how true this is. The photos at 100% zoom take up the entire screen, and there is no pixelation whatsoever. I am still working on various aspects of the photography (lens, etc) and I will put up epinions on these once I get some more time with them. Using the basic camera settings, I have been really impressed thus far. The  2x optical zoom (2.5x digital), although less than some other cameras, works really well, and once again, no graininess. Using the digital zoom blurs the images somewhat, but this is expected from any digital zoom.

    The next aspect to this camera that amazes me is the availability of attachments. I wanted a digital camera to be as close to a real camera as possible. The multitude of lenses and filters available attest to the &quot;realness&quot; of this camera. Nikon produces three different lens, a 2x telephoto, a wide angle (.65x) and a fisheye lens. The one that really caught my eye was the fisheye lens, which allows you to produce those neat IPIX 360 degree photos using the software included with the camera. Other companies, Tiffen, Kenko, etc, make other accessories for 800, such as filters, set-up rings and even an 8x telephoto lens. I ordered that 8x telephoto, and I haven't gotten it yet. Once I do, expect an epinion. It supposedly takes the zoom to about 500mm (without it, the CoolPix gets about 76mm). Once again, the math doesn't work out exactly, don't ask me why. Anyways, with the myriad of products available, this camera really allows any level photographer to have some fun with it.

    The final stipulation I had for the camera was affordability. Although some places offer the camera for $700, it can be found for $560 online at stores such as Buy.com (one of my favorites). Lenses vary in price from $80-$160, although 3rd party manufacturers often make cheaper lenses with bundles or packages available. Overall, the camera fits into a nice price range for the medium to high level enthusiast.
  
     Like all products, the camera does have some shortcomings. Nikon tech support is horrible. Don't expect anything useful from their tech webpage, and their phone service is even worse. Consider yourself lucky if you get a call returned in 24 hours. The online forums are only useful because of other people with similar problems, not because anything useful Nikon has done. Another huge complaint I have involves uploading the pictures to the computer. The camera comes with a serial cord (serial=slow) which I never was able to get working on my computer. Here is where I developed my high level of expertise with Nikon tech support. They are a bunch of sarcastic yutzes running a bulletin board and they will take every opportunity available to embarrass you with their replies. My advice as far as uploading goes - purchase a USB Compact Flash Card reader. The speed is ten times faster, and there is no need for software (a reader acts as another physical drive, using the little compact flash cards as disks.) 

   In general, if you can accept that the Nikon people don't love you, go ahead and purchase this camera. Most of the people on the tech forums are considerate enough to help you out if you have a specific problem. The camera takes amazing photos. It has several accessories, all of which are fairly affordable to the casual photographer. The camera itself sells for about $560 (It's all about the MegaPixels, baby) which is an unbelievable price for what you're getting. I would suggest this camera for anyone looking to purchase a digital camera for all purpose uses. A definite addition to the technophile's library.
