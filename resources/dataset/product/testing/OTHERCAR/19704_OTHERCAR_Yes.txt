            The 1998 Mitsubishi Galant from the get-go was supposed to compete with the likes of Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, VW Passat and Nissan Altima. Not a very easy task considering such a worthy handful. Earlier models of Galant were marred by not very good reliability and after 100K miles &#150 oil-guzzling engine. I think everybody at one time has driven behind an older Mitsubishi (or Dodge van, as they used to use Mitsubishi engines) and was forced to pass it because of unbearable and stenchy clouds of oil smoke it was emitting. But thankfully those days are over and Mitsubishi makes a lot better engines in my opinion. 

The 1998 Galant that I&#146ve driven for over a month was very quiet, very smooth on the highway, reasonably powerful automobile. There are always pluses and minuses however, and I will go over them next.

First, the good things about this car. The Galant has plenty of room in front as well as in the back. Legroom that is because there is not a lot of head and shoulder room, which I will talk about in the &#147Bad things about this car&#148 section. Passengers sit comfortable with plenty of space for their legs as both front and back seats are pretty comfortable. They are not too soft, like many other cars, therefore providing greater comfort on the long trips. The interior is very quiet, even at 65 MPH and above. Only when you get to about 80 MPH, you start noticing the wind noise, but you could still talk with your passengers without raising your voice. 

The instruments and controls are pretty well laid out, even though the anemic white lighting of the instruments could go. The engine is powerful, as for a 4 cylinder, and I think compared with Honda&#146s 4 cylinder, has significantly more torque, which helps in uphill drives, as you could rarely sense the downshifting. The 2.4 145HP engine is very lively off the start as well as when passing other cars. The automatic transmission that the engine is mated to is very smooth, barely noticeable. Keep in mind that during this review, the car had 70 000 miles on it, so it was not by any means brand new. Both engine and transmission are mated well; rarely can you notice the downshift, thanks in part to the amount of torque the engine provides at lower rpm, kind of unusual fact for a japanese 4 cylinder.

Now the bad things. The car overall feels like a tin can. The door feels very light when you open it, and you could easily swing it all the way to the fender. It also has a very unpleasant rattle when you close it, common to most Japanese cars. When I was washing the car, the amazing thing happened: when I put soaked wash mitt on the roof of the car, the metal popped without me even pushing on the mitt, I mean, it is not supposed to happen to a metal car, maybe to Saturn, but not to a car made from metal. 

While the car rides very smooth on highway, it freaks out when you try to enter a corner with a reasonable (say 20mph in 15mph zone) speed. Also, the suspension is rather weak; with just over 70K on the car, I can hear the bearings hum. This thing is common to a lot of Japanese cars however, my dad owned two Civics and had to replace the front axles, before either of them hit 100K. I&#146ve heard friends having to do the same thing with their Hondas. It is not a high cost replacement, but it is a nuisance and a wasted time at a shop. 

The head and shoulder room, especially in the back are lacking. When I had to raise the safety arm of the carseat, it could not go all the way up, therefore making putting my 1.5 years old son in the carseat, a major struggle.

As far as reliability goes, besides those humming bearings, indicating that an axle job is not far away, I couldn't find anything else wrong with the car. The engine was smooth and quiet, so was the transmission.
