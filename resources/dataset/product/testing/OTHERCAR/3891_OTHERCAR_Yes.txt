            I purchased an 1986 Plymouth Horizon (Charcoal Grey) in 1991, replacing a completely atrocious Oldsmobile.  My Horizon, a 5-speed, had about 45,000 miles when I bought it.  I had only minor problems -- nothing that I wouldn't consider "normal".  It overheated on me once, due to a sticking thermostat.  A $12 part, and it was fixed.

Some years later, I traded in the Horizon -- with 178,000 miles on it, and still running strong.  The dealership drove it for a while, until it dropped its exhaust, and has since been parting the car out.

UPDATE (July 2002): My Horizon met its end about two years ago. The dealer kept it in the back of their lot for at least six years, but when I last checked, it was missing, presumably towed away and crushed for scrap.

If you're looking to buy a used Omni or Horizon, here are my recommendations -- always go with a manual transmission, and make sure the oil is changed religiously.  Also, be careful on the 1985-87 models; the smog pump/air pump line valves disintegrate over time, and if you don't replace them in time, the entire smog pump will need to be replaced.  I don't think this was a problem in the later, fuel-injected models.  (My '86 had a computer-controlled carburator).

Great cars, though.  Fun, peppy, and tossable on back roads.  With some minor suspension tweaking (better sway bars, bushings, struts) these cars are really fun to drive. (If you're serious about performance, search the web for Omni GLH resources, and think about installing the Omni GLH performance suspension onto your Horizon. It would make a great 'sleeper.')
