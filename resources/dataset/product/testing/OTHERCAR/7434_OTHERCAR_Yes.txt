            I wanted to post a review on the Volvo S40 to remark about one item.  We like our Volvo with this one exception and that is the large front seat and rear seat headrests which make backing up very difficult.  Also the higher trunk profile adds to this problem with rear visibility.  When I have to back out of a parking spot, I rely almost totally on my rearview and sideview mirrors now because I see so little by turning around and looking backwards.  Volvo, I feel, goofed on the design in this respect.  They designed massive headrests without considering the impact they would have on reducing visibility.
