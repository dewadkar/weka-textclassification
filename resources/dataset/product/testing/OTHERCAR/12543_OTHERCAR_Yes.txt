            I bought my truck when it first came out in Sept 2000.  I love my truck it handles great and has a great suspension.  I only have one problem it is diagnosed as carbon build up on the throttle body.  It sounds like the lifters are going bad.  The problem is described as knocking, it only happens with cold start ups or when the truck has been sitting for awhile.  You hear a knocking for about 5 minutes. I took my vehicle to the dealer & they cleaned the carbon off of the throttle body (charges range from $34-70 depending on where you live.)  The down-side to this is, It has to be done every 4,000-8,000 miles on my truck.  I am using the gas that is recommended for the truck, but this is a problem in some of the trucks that GM has (GMC Sonoma, Sierra; CHEVY
S-10, Silverado).  GM has a fix that is coming out in 3 months, they have designed coated pistons for this problem and when they are done they are going to have a Technical Service Bulletin on it.  This means that they are only telling the service departments they have this problem and how to fix it.  You have to complain about the problems in order to get them repaired.

I have always been a truck person & never will get used to driving a car again. My truck has all the added features that you can want in a vehicle.

Vehicles overall, I think they are overpriced.  I paid $26,900 for my truck with all the "bells & whistles" that were offered.  I also bought an extended service plan through GMPP (General Motors Protection Plan.)  I purchased the Major Guard for 6 yrs or 100,00 miles with a $0 deductible.  The Major Guard extended service plan is the closet thing to a bumper-to-bumper warranty.  I really enjoy my truck and I recommend it to people even with the minor problem I have with the carbon build up.
