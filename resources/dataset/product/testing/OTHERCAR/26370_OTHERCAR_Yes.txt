            This car was my second car.  The first car I had was a '97 BMW 325i convertible so I didn't like this car at first when it came to the speed and handling.  I did like the fact that it's smaller than a Suburban and much much easier to park.  What I really love is the way that it is so customizable.  On mine, I put fog lights, chrome kick plates, new rims &amp; tires, flow masters, painted my fender flares a different color, customized the stereo, put in an alarm, and a few other little additions.  It looks totally awesome.  This car just begs to be fixed up.  I've seen these things with big old monster tires on them and they look really awesome.  
It drives pretty well.  Speed is something less than mach one since it doesn't have the Vortec but any more speed than this would probably either put me in the hospital or jail.  It handles pretty well but you can't expect a vehicle this tall with bigger tires to corner like a BMW.  
Mine is really noisy but that's a combination of the fact that I have bigger tires, an incredibly loud exhaust system and a really big stereo.  It rides really well compared to other chevy products I've driven.  I have the leather seats and they are very comfortable.  They just feel really good.  
The only things that have broke in my car are mostly things that are my fault.  I got a little rough with the cup holder once and it lost, I got Armor All on the lens in front of the speedometer so that had to be replaced.  The passenger side seat track had to be replaced.  Probably due to throwing it back and forth so hard.  
I only recommend this to young kids who want to beef it up and show off.  It's ok as a family car but getting in the back seat is challenging so you would probably only want to do it sporadically.  It's a big car so if you get in a wreck, you'll have a better chance of living.  It's got 4 wheel drive so going off road once in a while isn't bad.  They are a little higher up so older people might have trouble with that.  It just looks more like a young guy car to me.  Overall, I'd say it's a perfect young guys car to fix up and show off in.  <br><br>
