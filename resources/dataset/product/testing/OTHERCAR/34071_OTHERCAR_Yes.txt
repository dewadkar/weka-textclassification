            First things first, this car is a Luxury Sport Coupe (hence the LSC). This means it is a 2 door sports car built on a luxury car platform which should be rated accordingly. 2 door sport cars are not built with large trunks, soft suspensions, large backseats and total maintanence free driving. To the same degree luxury cars are'nt meant to be top speed canyon carvers that stop on a dime. 
 Having said that I believe this car falls smack dab in the middle. Which is right where it was intended to be.
My particular car has given me very little trouble (alternator) and makes me feel a little bit better just by sitting in it.
My personal complaints; the seatback should be taller or the headrest have some sort of adjustability towards the driver. Unfortunately Lincoln chose to mate the luxo-car transmission to the sprots car motor. Overdrive in a sports car is selectable; and automatic in a luxo-car. This car is also the family mans muscle car. This review based on driving my early 80's Cadillac and 90's turbo sportscoupe and convertible(domestic and foreign)
