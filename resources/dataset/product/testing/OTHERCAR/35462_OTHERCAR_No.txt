            Since you are reading this article, I would like to present information that would help you determine if the Sony Cyber Shot DSC-F707 is the right digital camera for you to purchase.

I listed the features that can be improved upon with this camera. This article is intended for individuals who are planning to buy a digital camera in the near future. Here are the reasons why I would not recommend Sony Cyber Shot DSC-F707 digital camera on Epinions:


The Design of the Camera: 
The camera lens is awkward to handle when hanging orientation of shots. Also, "jog" button on the back is hard to hit for the "center" position 

Memory Stick
A 5 MP camera comes with only a 16MB memory stick? They're practically forcing you to go out and buy another memory stick. Remember, Memory-Stick is Sony's proprietary format, which costs more than any other media, is limited to 128MB, and will only work with SONY products.; In summary, Sony memory sticks are expensive and slow.

Disturbing Features
- The Sony Cyber Shot DSC-F707 5x zoom lens is not as powerful as compared to other camera in the same price -range. "More optical Zoom" It does however deliver good pictures.
- There are no color-saturation controls
- The Cyber Shot DSC-F707 has limited continuous-shooting ability.
- The LCD displays blank out in low light manual mode making it difficult to frame your subject.
- I have read that many returned this camera for color lens alignment and for half the picture being dark. These cameras may suffer from an inability to handle high contrast situations.
- Older Cyber Shot DSC F707 suffers from LSD (Left side darkening) or tunnel effect. Left side is darker than the other side regardless of the shot condition, left side was sometimes dyed red in worse case. There is saturation of reds in certain circumstances.
- There are some White balance problems; Some pictures appear to be blue on the older manufactured models
- Is this camera to be recalled? There is some speculation that the camera is going to be recalled by Sony, but seems this has changed and corrected.
- No Black and White Feature.
- No RAW mode format- similar to TIFF - just a suggestion
- Expensive, but you get what you pay for!
- The viewfinder seems to be lighter than the actual picture, but this can be compensated for.
- The battery that comes with the Sony digital camera does not have the same warranty.
