            I'm only 18 and don't know very much about the workings of a car, so I'm writing this opinion more on feelings rather than technicality.

I've owned my 1999 Saturn SL2 for about a year and a half. We bought it &quot;newly used&quot; direct from the dealer. The dealership itself was VERY professional and easy going. They never made you feel pressured at any time. I haven't had a single problem with my Saturn since I got it, and being a young female, it's important that my vehicle is reliable and safe.  It's a great value for the quality of car you get. Buying American was also very important to me. Every time I get scheduled maintenance the dealership calls that same night and asks how everything went. I think that's great a company can keep business on a personal level, and not just treat you as just another customer. I guess thats why they say they're &quot;a different kind of company.&quot; I believe it. :)

I haven't had any problems since purchase, but I keep everything up to date as far as checks and oil changes and things. The car has great pickup, it really moves when I need it to. Even going down the highway at 80mph, it doesn't shake or become difficult to control like you'd think a smaller car would. Pretty decent gas mileage too. :)<br><br>
