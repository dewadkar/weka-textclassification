            I bought this vehicle after extensively searching the internet for the best buy for 4WD.  Now I know why it was such a bargain.  It handles poorly, especiallly in rain.  It has been in the shop for numerous things from the molding on the doors coming off twice to 8 hrs of engine work.  Yes everything has been under warranty so far but I drive alot and the warranty period will be over soon.  Don't make the same mistake as me.  If it is too late...watch for oil leaks- there is a problem on that model when they change the oil and the bolt on the oil pan not resealing properly... If it is hesitating at all take it in as there is also a problem they are now aware of with the engine and won't tell you unless you complain...there is a problem with that model and the heating vent that they &quot;have no fix for at this time &quot; where the vent won't switch from fresh air to recycled.  Good Luck<br><br>
