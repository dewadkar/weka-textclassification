            Had this minivan for almost 3 years since new, and about 40,000 miles. No major disasters, but the AC is weak and the engine has a death rattle that sounds like the effect of cheap gas but isn't. The paint is starting to fall off. Doors fit poorly, body panels have irregular gaps. In other words, it's a Chrysler.

Changed the transmission fluid at Jiffy Lube and within days the transmission was slipping and would not go into gear. Nice job! Don't go near those cowboys and get a Dodge dealer to do the job. EVERYONE knows the transmissions are garbage so change the fluid every couple of years and cross all your fingers and toes. The front brakes are close to shot. My van has the 14" rims and 10" disks - this van is just too heavy for such small disks. Will fit aftermarket cross drilled rotors when the time comes for replacement.

On the plus side, no breakdowns to date and lots of space for the kids to roam. Don't fool yourself though, this is a cheaply made vehicle that looks more shabby by the day.

Engine power is adequate, no more. The 3.3L is about as modern as a Model T but seems to be mostly reliable. Access for servicing is a nightmare, the rear 3 cylinders are well hidden and even changing spark plugs looks impossible. I intend to sell this van before 100,000 miles and avoid any big service jobs if possible.

Update March 2003:
Last year the transmission stuck in 2nd gear, the dreaded "limp home" mode. Dealer replaced both shaft speed sensors for about $200, could have been worse. Had the front brakes replaced at the same time, another $250 at the dealer. Last week I noticed a noisy right rear wheel, presumably a bearing. Went to the dealer and got stung for $1250 - rear wheel hub replaced, rear brakes replaced, transmission cooler hoses leaking and replaced, engine serpentine belt and tensioner replaced. As I feared, an expensive year for the minivan and at only 60K miles. This is easily the lowest quality vehicle I have ever owned, you would have to find a Yugo owner to get any lower.
