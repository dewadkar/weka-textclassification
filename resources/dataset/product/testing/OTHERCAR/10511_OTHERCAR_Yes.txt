            I have been searching for a replacement vehicle for my aging Acura Integra. The Integra is a wonderful automobile and I have over 174,000 miles without so much as a hiccup from it. This sort of bulletproof performance predisposed me to consider another Acura product. 

I looked at the 3.2TL, which is basically the new Legend. They don�t call it a legend because some bozo at Acura�s marketing headquarters felt it was important to emulate Lexus and BMW and use letter number names. They felt this would accentuate the brand of the company (acura) more than the vehicle, notwithstanding that they were throwing out a fortune in brand equity invested in the Legend nameplate. This is akin to Ford getting rid of the name Mustang in favor of M-V8.  

Here are my impressions of the  3.2TL:
Performance
I am not one of those people that care about the tenths of a second differences in 0-60 times, � mile rankings etc. I will say that this car is a rocket ship in terms of performance. I felt my Acura Integra was fairly zippy. The TL is warp powered compared. 

GPS Navigation System
Most people I talk to feel the $2K price tag for this option is certainly not worth it. Interestingly, there is a strong reaction against the idea of an electronic navigator from friends I know who would also react strongly against any co-pilot trying to give directions. This group mostly thinks spending $ 4 on a map is also a waste of money. 
The strongest reaction positive comes from what could be called by Marketing guru Geoffrey Moore as �Early Adopters�, tech savvy people who were first to adopt the Internet and like the latest widgets. These are people who were the first to buy digital watches, personal computers and DVD players. 

 I have used other GPS systems, such as Hertz Neverlost that comes on their rental cars, and thought those were very good. They don�t compare as well to the TL NAV system, which has an excellent touch screen interface and a much larger display. It even reduces the volume on the radio when it speaks. If your not sure this feature is worth the coin, then next time you rent a car, get the GPS system, they are on AVIS and Hertz cars and cost about $3 a day extra. I think you will find it is worth it. You will soon want one in your next car. I had one and someone at a dinner gathering had an allergic reaction to the food. We rushed to the car, looked up the nearest hospital in the GPS memory and were guided to it 4.6 miles away in a few rushed minutes. The GPS even gave us the phone number so we could call ahead and they were waiting with anti allergen medications  for our sick friend. It would have taken much longer to look up the number in the phone and navigate their by telephone directions. I�m not saying GPS can save a life, but it sure makes driving more convenient!

Xenon Lights
You have to drive the car at night to appreciate how much whiter and uniform the illumination of the High Intensity Discharge HID Xenon lighting is. This is another TL feature that will spoil you on driving any other way. Halogen bulbs will seem kind of dim after. I think they are excellent and make night driving much easier. 

AutoShifting
I don�t know how much I will use this, but it is a lot of fun to play with. It gives a lot of the fun of a manual transmission, that can be automatic in traffic. Seems perfect to me. The downside is that the auto tran on the TL is so well done, using a grade logic to shift on inclines, that you really don�t need to shift by yourself.  

Negatives
The rear seats don�t fold down. This is a disappointment, as it could increase the already large 14 cu ft. cargo area. I am a bit spoiled in this area as my last car was a hatchback and really benefited from fold down seats. They do have a pass through for skis and poles. I am told that the seats don�t fold in order to give the car more rigidity and crash worthiness. That could just be sales BS, but it sounds reasonable. 

Rear Seat room is a bit cramped, but I am fairly sure it�s not going to be me sitting back there, so who cares? Its very comfy for two and acceptable for 5 for shorter trips. There are 3 point seatbelts and headrests for three in back. I am 6�2�, and I found the front headroom just enough. For those over that height, you may need a shorter haircut or a different car. 

Exterior styling could be jazzier. The styling looks a bit too much like an Accord, which is not surprising as the TL is based on their Global Product Platform and shares 70% of the parts. This worried me at first, but a closer inspection makes it clear that the TL is a far superior product. The fit and finish, the glossy paint and the performance driving are all superior in the TL. Also the stereo system is excellent. The system is made by Bose, and sound reproduction is superb. 
Overall: 
 It really is an excellent value, especially considering Acura�s reliability. Comparable cars will cost many thousands more and not have as good a reliability or perfect mix of performance and luxury. This is a car that will provide years of value. Go buy it!
Other cars considered:
Subaru Outback: 4 wheel drive is nice, dealer network too dispersed
Audi A4-Too small and cramped, nice otherwise, more expensive. 
Audi A6-Beautiful, way more expensive similarly equiped, not as reliable
Saab 93-Quirky and sophisticated, very unreliable, the test vehicle smoked and broke down. A bad sign. 
Avalon-Big and luxurious, as good as a Lexus, similar price to TL, but an older persons car-boaty ride.
