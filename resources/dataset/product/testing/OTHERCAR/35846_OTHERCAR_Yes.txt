            My Saturn:
Me and my wife bought a used Saturn a few months ago, and it was a 
1997 Saturn. The Saturn had 29,000 miles on it. We have added 5,000 miles to it. It is the first Saturn we have ever owned. The car is a very good car so far. It gets great gas mileage,rides real good and feels very comfortable.  Has features such as a overide for the rear windows. So if your children are playing with the windows you can cut them off, also children safety door locks. My Saturn also handles good on wet roads, and also on bumpy dirt roads.  Some disadvantages are it has a small fuel tank and little leg room.  It also sits low to the ground, but other than that We love this car.  I will keep you posted on the performance of my Saturn. I recommend that big, tall people might not be comfortable with this car, and a large family.  I think anyone who's looking for a afforable, sporty, dependable, and great on gas.  You really should buy you a Saturn.

Thank You
