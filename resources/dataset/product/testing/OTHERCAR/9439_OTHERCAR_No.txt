            Ok I bought this car in March of 2000, I couldnt wait to show all my friends how cool I was in the "chick magnet" HAHAAH. It had 90,000 miles when I got it and Im at 155,000 now so Ive had more than enough time to tell what its like. Bottom line is I loved the car more than anything for the first year or so. I did many road race events and autocrosses (look that one up if you dont know.) I have modified the car very heavily and mostly everythign about it is aftermarket. Here are my horror stories along with the good parts. 

When I had it only 2 months, I would drive down the road and the car would just randomly turn off, all the way off. It did it whenever it wanted so I would have to drive down the freeway and turn my key to turn the car on while coasting at 75 mph, yeah that wasnt fun. Then it started burning oil, I think I went through about 2 quarts every 3 weeks. Oh, and the coolant started leaking out of nowhere leaving me kikin it on the side of the road waiting for it to cool off to add water. My timing belt broke one day... I was driving down the road and the damn thing started beeping at me and turned off (very confused), turns out my timing belt with 60K miles on it snapped causing my car to bend 3 valves and I had to rebuild the head. My wheel bearing went out, control arm bushings blown, and I need a new axle. There is more but I will spare you, basically this car has left me cursing up a storm everywhere I go and warning other VW drivers that their car might blow up soon.

I did have fun with it though, I won quite a few trophies at car shows and the car can go through turns like no other. Ive taken BMW's and Corvettes to school in the twisty mountain roads (yeah they knew we were racing.) I am as we speak trying to sell the damn thing to make room for my new Nissan Frontier Crew Cab and get out of the "lowered to the floor" car scene and get out on some dirt roads.
If you really have to buy this car, be prepared to deal with a lot of little problems but the car is so much fun to drive when its working properly, oh and the AC is as cold as I can stand, actually colder. When you see the seat comfort 5 stars, remember that I have Golf GTI seats in my car with racing harnesses.
