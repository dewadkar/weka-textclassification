            I love my Integra.  I have owned two other Integras from this generation and they were both as reliable and fun to drive as my 1997 GS-R.  Prior to the Integras, I owned a Honda CRX and the Integra was the logical automotive move.

The Integra GS-R doesn't especially excel in any one area, it is strong in all areas.  Good handling yet acceptable ride quality, excellent cargo capacity, good acceleration while maintaining good fuel mileage, the list goes on.

At 70,000 miles the car is still tight and looks new inside.  The chassis may be showing its age and beatings taken from the stiffer suspension, but there are no irksome rattles or noises from any particular area of the car.

The biggest problem I have had with this GS-R is a bent antenna.  Having owned many other Honda/Acura's, I know this car could easily go for another 100,000 miles without any major problems.

Because the Integra GS-R is a target of car thieves, the comprehensive insurance rates are among the worst of any automobile.

Although it is no Type R, the GS-R is still a great car.  Perhaps the Type R was a little too fun to drive as mine met an untimely demise of my own doing.  For most people the GS-R provides enough sport without any major sacrifices of comfort or economy.
