            With its stunning looks and agility, the Chrysler Concorde is an evolutionary vehicle.  I find it difficult to not stare when I am near one.  Recently, I decided to find out more about this beauty.

The Concorde is available in two models, the LX and the LXi.  They both come with these standard features:
* Two-speed windshield wipers with speed-sensitive variable intermittent mode
* Solar-control glass
* User-ready child seat top tether anchors
* Remote keyless entry
* Fully independent touring suspension
* Power trunk release and an inside emergency trunk lid release
* Brake-Park Interlock
* Air conditioning
* Illuminated visor vanity mirrors
* Fold-down rear sear armrest
* Center console with second power outlet
* Power exterior mirrors
* Power windows
* Speed-sensitive power door locks
* Leather-trimmed interior

The LX has a 2.7-liter 24-valve V6 with DOHC and delivers 200 horsepower.  The LXi has a 3.2-liter 24-valve V6 that delivers 222 horseys.  Both engines feature a leak-free design and 100,000 mile spark plugs.

Extras for the LXi include:
* Leather-trimmed seats with eight-way power front buckets
* Automatic temperature control
* Vehicle Security System with Senrty Key Engine Immobilizer
* Four-wheel disc antilock brakes and Low-Speed Traction Control
* 16&quot; aluminum wheels
* Overhead console with map lamps, compass, temperature and trip computer functions

The trunk space is 18.7 cubic feet and has a pass-through in the center of the rear seat to provide for more room.  Plus, six person seating is available with the addition of a 50/50 split bench front seat.

The available packages are too numerous to mention... I suggest you take a look at the Concorde at your nearest Chrysler dealer.  It's certainly worth your trip.<br><br>
