            I'm driving my, for me, new '90 Sentra.  This is the second Sentra I have owned, after driving my '86 into the ground by the middle of last year.  Both were purchased used.  These little sedans are a dream to drive.  they are peppy for a car with such little horsepower, and they take marvelously to mountain roads like we have on the California coastline.  If I can project what a NEW Sentra must be like from my experience with my used ones, I would highly recommend the car to anyone as value for the dollar!  I paid $6k for the first from a dealer and donated it to charity for a $1250 deduction last year with 204k miles on it.  The new one I got from a friend for $3k with only 17000 miles!  It's a dream!

The Sentra is a great car for a commuter, student, or small family.  The two-door model is a little tough getting in and out of the rear seats, but as long as the kids are young they can do it fine.  Don't try to get your 86-year old Auntie in the back.  The mileage is great... about 36mpg on unleaded regular fuel.  It's a great economy vehicle.<br><br>
