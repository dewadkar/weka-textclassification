            Why in the world would you spend an extra 10 to 20 thousand dollars on a mid-level Lexus when all of the amenities are right here within the 2000 Toyota Avalon?  The ride almost seems adaptive to what you desire.  Sometimes taut through the curves on the long way home, and somewhat cloud-like on the open road.  Throttle response is surprisingly quick, and handling crisp as can be. Inside, controls are ergonomic and somewhat dazzling at night.  With the premium sound package you may find yourself transferring the cd collection from your home stereo to your Avalon to appreciate the quality.  Affordability is moderate.....I would imagine a couple 30 years old + would be the target market for this sedan.  Value vs. price is outstanding, with Toyota proving, once again, that you don't have to sacrifice your beach house or childrens' college fund to experience luxury behind the wheel.  I have truly found nothing (Other than that optional 'purple' paint) that I dislike about the 2000 Avalon. <br><br>
