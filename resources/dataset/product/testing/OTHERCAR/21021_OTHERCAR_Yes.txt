            <B>Intro</B>
My friend recently purchased a DSC-P5 to replace his DSC-P1 and I've had the opportunity to use both on quite a few occasions.  I liked the DSC-P1 when he first got it last year and I was tempted to buy one, but the price ($799) kept me from ever actually purchasing one.  Well, the new DSC-P5 improves upon the DSC-P1 in many places and it drops the price by $200!  If I hadn't already purchased a digital camera in the past year, I would definitely be tempted  to buy the DSC-P5.

First off, let me tell you that the DSC-P1 was a great camera.  Go ahead and read the reviews on the DSC-P1 because the DSC-P5 actually shares the same great optics (lens) and CCD with the DSC-P1.  These cameras take great pictures and the unique body shape is actually quite comfortable.  

<B>What's new about the DSC-P5?</B>
First off, it's smaller and lighter than the DSC-P1.  The front face of the camera is flat when the lens is retracted (as opposed to protruding on the DSC-P1) which makes slipping the camera into a pocket that much easier.  Don't worry, the automatic lens cover is still there.  

Second, the flash is stronger and a new AF illuminator has been added to aid in autofocusing during low light situations.  If there were 2 complaints my friend had about his DSC-P1, they were the weak flash and the fact that taking pictures in low light was pretty much pointless.  Both of these problems are now fixed!  The flash range has been extended by about 3 ft. and the new auto focus works great.

Third, this camera sports new video clip recording technology called MPEG EX.  Those of you familiar with cameras which take short video clips will know that most clips recorded by digital cameras are limited to about 10-30 seconds in length.  Well, with the DSC-P5, you can shoot video clips (at one of the lower resolution settings) that are limited only by the size of your memory stick.

Finally, this camera is cheaper!  My friend paid $799 last year for his DSC-P1 and bought his new DSC-P5 for less than $600!  List price is $599 but you can find it for less on the intenet.  

<B>What's nice about the DSC-P5?</B>
The magnesium body casing on the DSC-P5 feels quite sturdy and seems to resist scratching quite nicely.  The 3x zoom is nice.  The camera takes great pictures and the ability to shoot video clips with sound is fun.  The camera is easy and intuitive to use, too.  Not being the primary owner of the camera I never  read the manual - I simply picked the camera up and started using it.  

<B>What's not to like?</B>
The only con I can think of with this camera is the media it uses: Sony's Memory Stick.  Memory stick media tends to be expensive and it's proprietary.  However, my friend doesn't look on this as a con at all.  Sure, memory stick media is more expensive than compact flash, but he happens to own a Sony VAIO laptop which has a built-in memory stick slot.  He simply removes the memory stick from his camera and places it into his laptop to transfer pictures really quickly.  I can see how that's convenient. 

<B>Conclusion</B>
I would recommend this camera to anybody because it's been a joy to use.  However, there are definitely other options on the market - the Nikon 885 comes to mind simply because another friend of mine has bought this camera and I've had the chance to use it a couple times.  That camera is just as nice as the Sony (maybe even nicer because it has more advanced options) but it's blockier.  If you had to decide between these two cameras it would probably come down to which shape you liked better, which media format (memory stick or compact flash) you preferred, and how important advanced options were to you.  The point is that there are lots of other 3 megapixel cameras in the $600 price range and you should try to take a look at a few but that the DSC-P5 should definitely make in onto your list of cameras to evaluate.
