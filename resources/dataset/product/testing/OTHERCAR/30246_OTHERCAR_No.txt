            This is the letter I sent to AGFA in complaint:
  
Thanks for taking the time. I suppose I have a few complaints about this product and I'd like to see if you can help me with them. I would be suprized to think AGFA would be satisfied with putting out such a nearly unusable camera.
First, The camera runs out of power quickly, and I can't seem to find any AGFA product that will help with that, I understand I can obtain a powersupply and I was hoping there was one designed to be compatible with it from AGFA.
Second, The camera runs out of picture space quite quickly with only 15 picture slots available, is there a memory pack I could purchase as an add on?
Third, This being my most important problem and also the problem that makes this product unworthy of use and an insult to your company reputation; the quality of the picture the camera takes is VERY low. The resolution on the pictures is poor and the coloring is off. The pictures aren't even worthy of a childs digital camera. 
I am unpleased with this product. As it was a gift, I couldn't possibly return it; I'd like to think your company stands by its name and will do something to help me be satisfied with it. 

  Here is their response:
Dear Jeff,

I am sorry that you are disappointed with the camera. Unfortunatly the camera is a low end camera and there is not an update that will allow for more pictures or longer use out of the batteries. As for the image resolution there also is not a way to adjust that. Again I am sorry but there is not anything that we can do to correct these issues as everything working correctly.

Thank you for contacting Agfa Technical Support.

Regards,

Jason

Now tell me, is that right?  I'm not only upset with the product, I am upset with the company.
