            Living and working in the Midwest can put great demands on the truck you drive.  It must work in extreme weather conditions and tackle rough terrain, while keeping me comfortable (a must!) and looking sharp.  After one year of driving (and punishing) a 1999 GMC Sierra, I must say that it passes the acid test.  The Sierra feels rock-solid on- and off-road, with a smooth 4 wheel drive system that will get you anywhere.  The powertrain is above average; I wish it had more low RPM &quot;oomph&quot;.  The interior is top notch.  Gauges are easy to read, the audio system is much better than what you'd expect from the factory, and the A/C will make you shiver on a 110 degree day.  The engine will NOT overheat (believe me, I've tried) - a testament to the outstanding cooling system.  I do have a few gripes, however.  I detest the cheap plastic airdam in front and plastic cladding on the rear bumper.  If you drive through tall grass or rough terrain, IT WILL BREAK.  Also, the Service Engine light comes on frequently to inform you that the gas cap is not properly in place.  I've made several trips to the dealer to fix this, but to no avail.  Overall, I thoroughly enjoy this truck.  It is fun to drive, and will get you ANYWHERE you want to go, in all conditions, in style.  This truck is for anyone who needs reliability, payload capacity, and comfortable accommodations in a stylish package.<br><br>
