               An accident forced me into a rental car, and despite the responsible parties insurance pledging to get me an equivalent to my own car, the best Enterprise could get to my Grand Marquis was a Buick Century.
    I lived with this now for five weeks, so what can I say about it? How about, "I can't wait to get my own car back!!!"
     I could never see anyone loving this car, but depending on what you want from a car, this could be tolerable, but to me it has no character. The best way to describe this car is the color of it's interior, gray.
     If you want reliable transport, but have no particular preference regarding performance, gas mileage, amenities, or appearance, this could be the car for you. But if you have strong feelings in any of these directions, then forget it.
    To give it the benefit of the doubt, it's looks could be described as bland. Or perhaps nondescript, would be better? It is slab sided with no moulding, stripes, chrome, or anything to break it up. Steel wheels covered with gray plastic caps complete the exterior ensemble. Inside is a mass of Gray plastic. The controls are fairly standard GM fare. The column shift puts all controls on a single stalk, with no steering wheel controls. The single CD player and AM/FM radio are adequate, but not awe inspiring. The gray cloth seats (drivers electrically adjustable fore/aft, and up/down)are comfortable on short trips, but I can't comment for long journeys. The manual dual zone air conditioning ( I won't call it climate control, I have the real thing in my car, and this does not bear comparison) cools the car enough for a Florida summer, but when the vehicle been sitting in the sun for a few hours, to do so means running the fan at high speeds, and noisily, for quite a while. I accept that most systems can be noisy here at times, this just seems to take longer at these levels.
    The interior is large enough for for in relative comfort, five at a squeeze. Not bad, unless you bear in mind that the rental company regards this as a "full size" car.......hhhmmmmm. The one thing I do like about the interior is the front centre armrest. This, having cup & cellphone holders as well as internal storage for CD's, etc. is a good thing. It means that even tall cups are out of the way of vehicle controls, and provides accessible storage. This is much better than the ones I have in the Grand Marquis, which, though independent for each seat, are only armrests.
    The 3.1L V6 produces a claimed 175Bhp, put develops it so high up the rev range that you have to wring it's neck to get it to go anywhere. With a solo driver, it can keep up with traffic, but to do so leaves you with a lot of harsh, tinny, engine noise, and I have doubts if it could with for large gents on board. Not nice. The car stops well though, with good power and feel, and no nasty surprises. The suspension is set too soft for handling, but falls short of the "sumptuous ride" levels, and can over rail tracks, for instance, can still jar. So, once again, falling into no-mans land between two camps, only hurts the overall impression.
    Throughout my period with this car I've averaged around 24mpg. While this outshines the 16.4mpg I normally average in my Grand Marquis, the loss of comfort, power, space, and amenities, to get there makes it a poor trade.
    The trunk is a reasonable size, and the split folding rear seats are useful for longer loads, but the high sill & loading height take the edge of this good feature. 
    So we get down to the Good, the bad, and the Ugly.....or to be more accurate, the Good, the adequate, and the Ugly.

Good:
  Trunk Space, enough to get a very large hard sided case  
  and several bags. Better than average.
  The front armrest, good storage.
  Brakes, good feel, with power.

Adequate: 
   Gas consumption
   Space
   Air conditioning
   Comfort
(Barely adequate):
   Performance
   Handling

Ugly:
   Looks. Bland; dull; Vanilla, with a a capital V!
   High load sill makes good trunk difficult to use
   High interior noise levels, because you have to run 
   everything at high speeds to get the performance
   required.

So there you have it. Jack of all trades, master of nothing.
