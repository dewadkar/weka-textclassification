            I love my Miata!  I was not even planning on buying a car at all on the day I bought my Miata.  It was back in 1995, and I was car shopping with a friend for a car for her daughter.  I looked over and saw this cute white 1994 Miata and I hadn't been in a convertible for years, so I decided to just take it for a test drive. Before I was back at the car lot, I knew that I had to have this car!

A couple days after I purchased the car, I was heading out across the Chesapeake Bay Bridge with the top down, hair blowing in the wind and feeling more alive than I had in a very long time.  I think other Miata drivers will know what I am talking about, but you just become like a different person when you sit behind the wheel of a Miata with the top down!  It is just so much fun to drive and handles so great! 

I have had it for 5 years now and it has over 76,000 miles on it and it still feels and acts like a new car!  I change the oil every 3,000 miles and get the 30,000 mile dealer maintenance done and I haven't had any problems with the car!  I actually feel safer in this little car than I do in some of the bigger cars that I have owned, I think mainly because the steering is so tight that it moves on a dime.  I have gotten out of some messes that I saw coming my way just by a jerk of the wrist. 

The only downside of this great little car is the small trunk and the fact that you can only take one person with you.  I did actually take a friend to the Outer Banks for a week and was able to pack enough clothes and a few other things though.  You just can't take the big suitcases and coolers with you.  Also, I've had to take a couple of days off this winter because of the snow, because it just doesn't do too good on ice or snow.  If you are in a slump, I can guarantee you that this great little car will pick you up and make you have fun!   <br><br>
