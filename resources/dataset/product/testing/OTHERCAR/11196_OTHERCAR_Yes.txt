            I bought this car used in 2000. I needed a car big enough for me and my children. I have put 23,000 miles on it so far, and several problems have arisen. The engine and transmission are excellent, but the brakes have been a problem. I have had to replace the calipers, rotors, and rear pistons due to failure. The car rides excellently and has enough power to suit. It is a little slow from a stop, but cruises at highway speed effortlessly. I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a relative bargain in the full size luxury car market. Be aware of potential problems with the brakes however, and have it checked by a mechanic before buying.<br><br>
