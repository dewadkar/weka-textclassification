            As the self-appointed automotive expert in my family, I had the unenviable task of helping my sister shop for her eighteenth-birthday present this past weekend.  She already had her heart set on a Ford Focus coupe--an admirable car in its own right, but after trying out the Echo--I am pushing her towards Toyota.

The quirky-looking Echo offers a surprisingly quiet ride for a car in its class, an adequate engine which had acceptable power even when coupled with an automatic transmission, an unbeatable price, and the assurance that the Toyota nameplate offers.  The Focus ZX3 we tried stickered for just over $14,000.  The Echo, identically equipped save for aluminum wheels and a CD player, was priced under $13,000.  

The interesting dash arrangement--with instrument cluster placed in the CENTER of the panel, is so designed to reduce driver fatigue, an interesting concept still unproven on me.  The seats were firm and comfortable, and upholstered with a fun and durable print.  The coupe model I tried had admirable head and leg room up front, though I imagine the back seat would be a bit cramped for adults. 

My overall impression was favorable, and I am glad that Toyota once again has an entry-market car to offer.  My only wish is that the Echo had been made three years ago when I purchased a Dodge Neon!<br><br>
