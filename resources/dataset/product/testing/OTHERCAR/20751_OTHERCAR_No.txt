            This is a reply to mtfbwy's review of a Chevy Blazer.  I've never owned a Blazer but I'd like to brief you on my experience with General Motors vehicles.

In response to 'mtfbwy's review: I agree with the statement about walking rather than owning another General Motors vehicle.  I traded in a 1997 Cavalier for a 1998 Camaro.  Big mistake.  

I'll start with the Cavalier, which broke down in my driveway shortly after driving it off the lot.  The day I drove it home the emergency brake cable broke and spewed fluid on my rotors.  I got that fixed and immediately started having electrical problems.  Finally, after several attempts, I got the electrical problems (yes, plural) fixed.  Then I had to have the seals on the sunroof and the passenger side window replaced.  I also had to have the rear strut mounts fixed.  The day I brought the Cavalier in as a trade for the Camaro I received a recall notice for the Cavalier's airbag sensitivity switches!

On the day of the trade, being finished with my 'Saturday morning hang-over car', as I affectionately called it, I happily drove home in my new Camaro.  That happiness didn't last long.  Though the Cavalier's problems were, for the most part, annoying, it was still a fairly safe car to drive.  I can't really say the same about the Camaro.

At about 8800 miles I noticed a slight shimmy in the front end when I applied my brakes at highway speeds (50mph and up), which got progressively worse as time went on.  At approximately 11,000 miles I got fed up with the shimmy and brought it in for 'warranty repairs'. [NOTE: I did not use the same dealer as the one that worked on the Cavalier.  I figured they'd done enough damage on the other car, they weren't even breathing on this one!]  I asked the dealer to replace the rotors because they were (and still are) warped, to which they replied &quot;No way.&quot;  They 'turned' them instead, based on the warranty wording of the dealer  having the right to &quot;repair or replace&quot; the part in question, at their discretion.  Okay, I'm fairly flexible.  I guess can live with it as long as it fixes the problem.  

At about 16,000 miles the shimmy returns! I call the dealer about this and again ask them to replace the warped rotors.  This time I get a very firm &quot;NO WAY&quot; and an 'explanation' that &quot;brakes are not covered under warranty&quot;(!?!?!?!) and that they did me &quot;a favor&quot; by turning them the first time!  I argue that the rotors are not brake pads (which are specifically excluded from warranty) and that the rotors are defective.  I'm then told that General Motors will NOT replace the rotors because I'm 'hard on the brakes' - that it's my fault they're warped (it's a 5 speed so I downshift more than I brake - give me a break &lt;pardon the pun&gt;).  Now the Cavalier, an automatic, had over 23,000 miles when I traded it in and, other than the day I brought it home, had no brake problems (surprisingly, given that car's history!).  Still they insist it's all my fault for &quot;being hard on the breaks&quot;.  

In my frustration I searched and found another dealer - one with a conscience - to turn the rotors again.  They wouldn't replace the warped rotors because they didn't repair them the first time (and because of the lame excuse that General Motors won't cover 'maintenance repairs' - ugh!).  I even called the corporate '800' number but that was a waste of time.  I was again quoted the &quot;replace or repair at the dealer's discretion&quot; blurb. 

Hello!  The rotors are WARPED, turning them only temporarily 'fixes' the problem.  This SCREAMS defective materials to me!  Defective materials are SUPPOSED to be covered under the warranty!

Anyway, when the shimmy starts again, and I'm sure it will, there will be nothing left on these rotors to turn.  And by then I'm sure my so-called 'warranty' will have expired, leaving no recourse at all for me with General Motors.  How pathetic.  $21G+ for a car and this is the treatment one receives.  What a way to handle customers.  

Needless to say, once I get rid of this car, I won't be buying a new General Motors vehicle!

Final note:  In this review I've commented under 'reliability' that there were 'several visits to the shop per year' and that's true.  I also had the car in for speaker repairs 3 times.  They couldn't find the problem the first two times but it was unquestionable the third time and the repairs were done.  I didn't dwell on this issue because speakers are not that big of a deal.  I can live without music.  I could very easily die without brakes.<br><br>
