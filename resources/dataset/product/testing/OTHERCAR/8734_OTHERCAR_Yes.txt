            Epson outdid itself again with the PhotoPC 850z CCD. Every option and little design couldn't be better. The best investment I've made yet. Highly recommended! All the features on the Photo PC are advanced, but user friendly. Durable, well constructed, and a must for any Photographer/CCD buff. Adaptable for both PC and Macintosh platforms, and USB interface makes this device simple to install. there are loads of optional features like a lens adapter for additional zoom and filter lenses, a hot flash shoe for extra flash, fully programmable or one step automatic setting. LCD screen for quick reference of shot, and even a mic for quick audio references of every picture taken.  <br><br>
