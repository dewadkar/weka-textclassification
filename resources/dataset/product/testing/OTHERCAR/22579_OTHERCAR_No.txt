            I was the owner of a 1996 Formula Firebird....and all I can say is that it was a typical love/hate relationship.  I loved the style, the power, the fun of the car so much that it was affectionately nicknamed &quot;Baby&quot;.  But, in spite of all the good times, the car spent ALOT of time in the shop.  I had the car for a little over two years and it had to be worked on 14 times, mainly for an electrical problem that nobody seemed to be able to fix.  I thought I had a lemon until I overheard another distressed owner complaining to the service manager about the same problems that I had previously experienced.  I ended up getting rid of the car because I had a child, and the carseat just didn't work in the back seat of this car.  If you want fun without headaches, then look elsewhere for your vehicle.<br><br>
