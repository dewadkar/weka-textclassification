            2 reasons I bought the 328ci 3 months ago:
1. The dealer was going out of business, I could get it for only $500 above the invoice price (I think it is a good deal, but maybe not)
2. I have a Acura Legend 4dr and a Mercedes E430, and I was dying for a 2 door sport coupe... 

2 things made me very unhappy:
1. I visited BMW dealer twice to try to program my keys, but they were too busy for little things like that, and kept asking me to come back later. 3 months later, I still couldn't get my keys programmed.
2. As soon as I setup my &quot;EasyPay&quot; with BMW Financial Services, they messed up my bank account by withdrawing payment twice from my account. Then I've got a penalty ($59 + Finance charge) from my visa card company due to insufficient fund in my bank account. BMW Financial Services refused to pay for the penalty although it was their mistake. (yeah, try to imagine what happen if you pay them late. This is very unfair.)

Overall, I think the 328ci is very well designed, in and out. The interior is very comfortable, everything is within reach. The handling is excellent. The upgraded sound system is amazing! The rain sensor is a very nice feature, and the Xenon light is great! Also, the interior lighting is nice and bright. 

However, I think the 328ci is lack of power. OK, I know I shouldn't compare it with my E430 (like apple and orange), but my E430 can easily outrun the 328ci. Also, I found the gas mileage on my E430 seems to be better than the 328ci although E430 has a bigger engine, which is interesting. The in-dash CD player that I added is missing a &quot;repeat track&quot; function. The 2 vent windows on the back take a long time to close, and you can hardly tell if you closed them or not, especially when you are driving. 

In term of the ride, it is nice and firm. It can handle any turns at high speed. However, if you want to have a nice smooth ride, don't expect too much from it.

But overall, I think the 328ci is a very nice car, especially I think I've got a very good deal on it. 

Here is what I have for $37,800:
- Premium Package (Includes power glass moonroof, myrtle wood trim, auto-dimming mirror, power seats with driver's memory, 4-spoke leather-wrapped multi-function steering wheel, on-board computer, front armrest and rain sensing wipers)
- 5-Speed Steptronic Automatic
- Leather Upholstery
- Heated Front Seats
- Xenon Headlights
- Radio: AM/FM Stereo with CD
- Harman Kardon Sound System<br><br>
