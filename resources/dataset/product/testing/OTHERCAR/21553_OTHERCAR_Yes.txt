            I love this camera.  After months of research, testing and reading reviews, I decided on this camera.

First of all the camera is very durable. I have dropped it and tossed it around and no problems at all with its performance.  The casing is metal and feels very substantial and looks very expensive as well.  The camera is very small, about the size of a pack of cigarettes.

The size is what was most important to me, besides the photo quality of course. For me, if the camera was too large, I would never carry it around.  With the black leather case that you can buy separately, you can clip it to the back of your belt and it's barely larger than a cellular phone.  Moreover, and most importantly to photo takers, the image quality is excellent. I personally do not use the included software and edit all my images on Photoshop.  I am still impressed by the depth of color, clarity and otherwise total quality of the images this camera takes.  Color, daytime shots are especially crisp and life like.

The only area this camera falters is night shots.  If you have substantial artificial light or the subject is very close to you, the picture quality is likewise fantastic.  It's when you take shots out of the range of the relatively weak flash that you run into problems.  Because the flash is so weak, shots taken farther than about 10 feets will come out too dark.  By night shots I mean in the complete darkness with little light.  The zoom is weak on this as well. You will not want to use digital zoom as it pixelates the pictures upon enlargements.

Overall this is a great camera and because of the size and quality of pictures I take it with me everywhere and have taken literally thousands of pictures with it.  To me this is the hallmark of an outstanding electronic product - something that makes you want to use it all the time.  In terms of zoom and night photos though the camera is lacking.  Overall for most pictures tasks, especially vibrant color montages and human subjects, the camera excels.  If the majority of your shots are distant or night shots though, you might want to look elsewhere.

I would easily recommend this camera though to anyone looking for a good overall and portable camera.  Not to mention it looks great and I still get comments from everyone about it.
