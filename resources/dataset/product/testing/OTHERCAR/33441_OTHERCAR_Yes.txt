            Volkswagen lovers... Pay attention here!  The New Jetta is a great investment, for looks, speed, sound and all-around reliability!  From my first looks of the car, it was way cute and perfect for a teenager to cruise around in on a Saturday night.  But little did I know that it is fit for a sixty year old to go grocery shopping in on a Monday afternoon!  For starters, the Jetta is incredibly reasonable, lying between 15,000 and 20,000, pending on the customization of the vehicle.  Mine comes with a great sound system, equipped with a six-disc changer in the trunk and clearly sounding speakers.  The jetta is also available with power options, as well as manual, for instance, the windows and seat adjusters.  

While driving this car, a sense of safety overcomes you.  Fully equipped with driver side and rear airbags, safety is a big concern with the Volkswagen makers.  With two bucket seats in the front, and room for three in the back, the whole family can cruise in a safe and comfortable ride!  (But I would not recommend the back seat for those with longer legs, the leg room tends to be limited.)  

I would recommend this car to all those who love to pay less for a great car, and for those of the older generation who want to look cool!!<br><br>
