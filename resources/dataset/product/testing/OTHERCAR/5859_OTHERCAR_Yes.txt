            I'll Keep it short a simple.  This is an amazingly tight package -- meaning GOOD!

This is a most bang for the buck car!  I picked mine up for $26,900.  And I love it.  My wife and I fight over who is going to drive it.  

The interior is well apportioned, and definitely conservative in style.  I particularly like that there are really no options.  

Gauges are easy to read and understand.  And controls are fairly intuitive.  

Gas mileage is approximately 21 for mixed city-highway driving.  The car has good acceleration, and the Tip-tronic shift is great.  I've driven manual transmissions for years, and initially found myself miss-judging braking situations, since I was not shifting (down-shifting).  But with the Tip-tronic, I slid the shifter over and down shift.  This feature will likely come in handy during an emergency evasive procedure.

I chose the White pearl, and I am very pleased.  The car has a nice understated elegance, and economically speaking, it's a wise choice in this market segment.

I have no problems recommending it!

Current update:  December 14, 2000.  I have now had this car for almost one full month.  I've logged over 2,200 miles, and I am still happy with it.  The ride is very nice.  It is difficult to really know how fast you are going.  I was recently driving around the state of Florida for business and logged over 800 miles in 18 hours.  I felt fine after the trip -- tired, but not dead from the drive.  The car was smooth and reliable.  I averaged almost 27 miles to the gallon, and that was while I was averaging 85 mph.  I had this car up to 110 mph and had no problems.  

After driving this car for several weeks now, I do have two complaints.  First, I end up going much faster on the highway than I realize.  Thankfully there is cruise control!!!  Second, the car does have a tendency to have the body roll more than I like.  This is possibly due to the suspension and the tires.  And I'll get to the bottom of that as soon as the tires are replaced, as I will go for a lower profile performance tire.

But, all in all, this car is a dream.  It has definitely made a change in my demeanor after driving home from work!!!

February 18, 2001 -- This car continues to delight.  The ride is smooth and quiet.  There is a noticeable amount of body roll, but that is likely due to the tires.  The car comfortably fits 4 passengers, and if necessary a small child in between.  There is not a lot of extra leg room in the rear, but you can easily accommodate 4 6' individuals.  It's a great couples car.  The child seat anchors are great.  The leather is nice and comfortable.  And I LOVE the heated seats.  

Audio is very good, and definitely has some oomph.  The car handles very well, and is a pleasure to drive.  Trunk space is excellent, and gas mileage is around 22mpg for mixed driving.  

I've taken the car up to 125 MPH and it handles well, but is noticeable suspect to wind conditions.  Please note that I would not recommend driving this fast.  But the car does get up and go!  And even at that speed the car still had plenty of pedal room for more.  Air noise at that speed and at most highway cruising speeds is very good.  Obviously, the slower you go the less wind noise.

Evasive driving is good to very good.  

Well, that's all for now.

Ciao,

Jonathan
