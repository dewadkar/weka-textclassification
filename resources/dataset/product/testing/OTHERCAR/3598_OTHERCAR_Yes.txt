            The Canon G2 is my second digital camera and to date also my best.  For first timers this is a great camera.  The camera come packaged with everything you need to get started including some photo software to use with your new photos.  You get the camera, strap, adapter cords, battery, and something that comes with very few cameras...a remote control.  You can use the remote to either take photos or even better to do your playing back of them.  Other great features of this camera are the swivel LCD.  Instead of just having the option of a regular fixed LCD, this one swivels and rotates, making taking photos from any angle easy.  Also, the LCD can be faced into the camera to avoid damaging the screen, a great feature.When you pick up the camera you will notice the solid, weighty feel.  The camera is partially plastic, I prefer a solid magnesium body, but the plastic feels solid.  The contol buttons are metal and they are all clearly marked.  The menu system in the camera also feels pretty intuitive.  While I am not sure what every feature does, I have been able to figure most out on my own.  By the way, read the manual a couple of times and have the camera right there to practice all of your new found talents.

As far as the actual photos, I have cropped and altered many and both my feedback and others that have seen these photos say that they look like regular film photos.  They are right!  And if you send them in for regular photo printing, you will be unable to see any difference.

Bottom line....buy this camera but know that if you're like me, an amateur, you are buying more camera than you really need but you'll have a great time figuring it all out.

HAVE FUN!
