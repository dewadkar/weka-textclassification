            This was my first digital camera. I did a little research on them before buying, so I would not go into it blindly.  
I learned about the differences between digital & optical zoom, and all that jazz. I set out to buy one in my price range. I needed the 3X optical, and minimum of 2 megapixels. After looking at several cameras, I came across this one at Target. After bad service, I decided to get treated better, and even pay less at Wal-Mart. I looked it over, and the photo clerk showed me the easy use of this camera, From what I could tell, it looked like even a beginner like me could handle this one. 

It met my criteria in price and needs. So I took it home, unpackaged it, and began to try it out. From all the other cameras I looked at, this one was great because the menus were easily, and quickly accessible. I tried just about every possible mode of taking pictures that thing had. Low light, no light, night shouts, back light, you name it I tried it. And I did it all with the greatest of ease.

After downloading the pictures onto my camera to see exactly how clear these were, I was amazed at the clarity. They were focused where I wanted them, and the optical zoom did it's job well. 

So of course I had to play with it some more, but to my surprise, my brand new batteries seemed to have lost their life after only so much time. My first thought was that the batteries that came with it, were some no-name cheapies. So I put my brand new Duracell Alkaline's, and went at it again. But there I was again, in about the same time, with low batteries. 

And after looking into it, I found out that this is what happens when you purchase a camera without a viewfinder, and the LCD is in use constantly. With that in mind, consider that you will be eating batteries rather quickly with this puppy. If you have some rechargables, then no problem, it won't bankrupt you in battery costs.

I think if you're looking for a Camera for a decent price, this is the one. I found it easy to navigate through the controls, where others seem difficult or cumbersome. I'm glad that I chose this one. I had no idea how to use these things, so this was perfect for me, as it was a breeze! 

Highly recommended!
