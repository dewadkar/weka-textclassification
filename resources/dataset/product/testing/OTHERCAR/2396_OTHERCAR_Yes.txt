            I bought this camera to assist me in on line auctions as i wanted better picture quality than a scanner. I found this camera to be very adaptable to my needs. It has a variety of settings to achieve almost any appearance 
you wish to convey.

The price is variable from many different distributors. I was able to get a $100 rebate. I don't know if it is still available but if you go to toshiba.com it should point you in the right direction.

The camera appears to look bulky but it does feel fine in your hands. There are two downsides. Even though it has a macro feature on it, pictures sometimes are not clear. Also the viewfinder is positioned off to the side which can fool your angle of sight.

Picture density is easily adjustable and smart card holds a max of 144 pix
at lowest resolution. Viewing and erasing of pictures is a bit complicated at first but improves with usage.

I believe this particular camera gives you the best bang for the buck in an upscale model. I would recommend it.<br><br>
