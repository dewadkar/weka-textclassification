            This is an excellent camera technically, however recent experiences I have encountered have led me to change my mind.  The only problem is that there are only a few models available in the market in this category.  Please see my previous review.

It ranks high in lens quality, performance, ease of use, and manual override capabilities.

The lack of a swivel LCD screen is very sadly omitted by Minolta.  The ability to switch between manual and automatic focus by accidentally touching the button is a poor design feature as is the placement of the neck strap ring over the CF door.

The unadvertised APO shutdown feature is really a sad feature.  Minolta should really look into this and either remove it or advertise it so that you are not caught using it while deleting an image at the same time.  The end result for me was the corruption of all my images in my CF card, which caused me to spend $$ to recapture the lost images.  

The attitude received in the repair department was a real shocker to me. I have never encountered this in my life as a consumer.  At Canon I have always been treated as a consumer with respect and professionalism.  As a result I will never buy another one of their products in the future.
