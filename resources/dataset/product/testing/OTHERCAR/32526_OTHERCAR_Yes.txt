            I bought a used SC2 in October '96 and in January '97 I was T-boned in the driver's door on an icy interstate. My head broke the driver's window (fortunately I was wearing a baseball cap that I found lots of glass shards in later). The speaker popped out of the door and hit my ankle pretty hard. I was left sitting across the interstate, hoping someone wouldn't hit the passenger door too. Other than a sore ankle and a stiff neck, I walked away unharmed.  I am soooooo glad that I had the steel safety cage that Saturn promotes!  The body shop said that the whole frame was sprung, meaning the whole frame had been shifted to the right (about 4 inches judging by the dash). It was totaled. I took pictures and took it back to the dealership with me, everyone was impressed that I walked away from that!

I turned right around and bought another SC2. This time it was brand new instead of used, not that I got a lot of insurance money...I was lucky to not have to pay anything, they tried to make ME pay $600, we fought to come out as even. Anyway, I went right back to Saturn.

I was first impressed with the Saturn dealers the first time I walked on the lot. I was looking at the new ones, just for future reference. A salesman asked to help us. Dad said that we were just looking and not going to buy anything today, much less new. Bob (the salesman) asked if we were familiar with Saturn. When we weren't he offered to show us around, knowing full well we weren't buying today. When I decided on Saturn, he even helped us with the used car, even though he was a new car salesmen. 

I like the no haggle way of buying, and the salespeople are very nice. Two years later, Bob still recognized me as one of his customers!  The lease is up in a couple of months and I plan to get a 3-door coupe. My friends will appreciate this when more than one goes with me to lunch at work.  LOL

I love the looks of my Saturn, the '97 body style. The only drawback is the lack of legroom in back. There is a lot more room up front with the new style where the coupe is on the sedan frame. The power is also a little less than I would like. But I've learned how to work around it, even with an automatic. I can beat nearly anyone I want when leaving a stoplight or merging with traffic.  :)  <br><br>
