             Man let me tell you this Jeep is one of the best Off road vehicles. I have a 96 Jeep Wrangler, 4 cylinder, 2 wheel, 4 wheel , 4 hi 4 low, transmission. I have 28 in tires and a 6 in body lift. This car will take you any where. You can get your Jeep hard top or soft top, I prefer the hard top because when it rains and snows the plastic roof sometimes will leak and cause your car to smell sour. The Jeep Wrangler is all of your opinion. If you like to go off road and ride deep in to the woods or go hunting, or just plan if the weather is bad I would suggest you get your self a Jeep Wrangler. The is one problem though, the lights on a Jeep Wrangler and this go's for just about all Jeeps, they have electrical problems the one I have the Head lights go out when you hit a major bump and that is not a major problem and can be fixed for 35-50 dollars depending on who you deal with.<br><br>
