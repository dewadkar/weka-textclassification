            I drive a 1990 Honda Accord EX. It is loaded with options and it drives like it is brand new. I bought the car from the original owner for $5,000. It is in excellant shape, the list value is $6800. The car is very reliable it has 150,000 miles, most of these cars will get at least 250,000, this is how Honda built it's reputation. The car is simply the best investment I ever made. The suspension is wonderous, the engine is just unbelievable, and the transmission is unbelievably silky. Besides this car being a driver's dream it is also very peppy and ready to roll. I have driven many cars, and I am proud to say that I enjoy mine the most. You can't understand until you drive one, but these cars are the most beautifully engineered machines ever. I would strongly advise you to buy a Honda Accord if you are in the market for a used car, you won't regret it. These cars are truly what American car-makers will always envy. <br><br>
