            I test drove a 97 Prelude in 99 when I was looking for a new sports car.  I had tested many cars in the sporty category.  Of them all, my two favorites were the Prelude and the BMW 328 (which I got).  

There is a lot to love about the Prelude.  I happen to like the styling, although it is controversial.  I could do without the ugly headlights, though.  The handling is extremely neutral, which is amazing considering that it is front wheel drive.  It felt very controllable in fast corners.  The steering was very responsive, and the car changed direction quickly.  The Prelude remains fairly flat through hard cornering.  The manual stick shifter felt smooth and easy to use.  With the manual transmission, the acceleration is strong until you get to about 6200 rpm, at which point it becomes a BLAST!  The VTEC engine makes a jet turbine-like wail from 6200 to 7500 rpms that sounds awesome.

Now for the negatives.  If you want an automatic, just forget the Prelude, unless tepid acceleration is not an issue for you.  The 4 cylinder VTEC engine simply does not operate well with an automatic.  It doesn't have enough torque at lower rpms.  I am a tall guy with a big build, and I was not comfortable sitting in the Prelude.  Especially annoying was the rounded edge of the center enviromental control console, which dug into my right leg constantly.  I personally didn't want a solid black interior, but that's the only interior color choice for the Prelude (there are a few 97 only with the green exterior/ivory and black interior color scheme, but these are hard to find).  For this car's cost and class, I thought that the interior could have been a lot more luxurious and interesting.  It feels and looks like a Civics.  The cargo space under the rear hatch is shallow and limited.  The rear seat is unusable for adults, but that's not unusual for cars in this class.

Ultimately, although this car was fun to drive, it was not the car for me.  If you are in the market for a 97 Prelude, you also ought to test drive a 97 BMW 325 or 328 for comparison.
