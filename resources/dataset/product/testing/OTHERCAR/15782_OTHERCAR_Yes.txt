            I had been doing quite a bit of web reading on what my next vehicle would be. I was driving a 95 Grand Am and also own a 91 Olds Calais Quad442. The Olds is/was a weekend project and the GA was the daily driver (I do a lot of driving for work). Both having a Quad4 engine, I have become a Quad4-gearhead. Well the Grand Am was slipping in reliability, comfort and had heaps of frustration to give!
Let's just say, it was time. After buying my dream house I decided to consolidate. Having a family with only one 11 year old (of whom the Doctor has declared is on his way to 6 foot 6!!) and a claustrophobic wife, I knew I needed a fairly roomy sedan.

In the following, I'll try to point a few things that perhaps haven't been covered in most of the 2003 6 reviews (I think I've read all of them before making my purchase!)

<b>First Sight</b>
At first sight, the 2004 Mazda6 hasn't changed from the 2003. The only notable change is the existence of a radio antennae protruding from the top center of the rear windshield (a la VW). Reports were, I think, that the in glass version on the 2003 yielded less than average reception for most local stations. Otherwise the outside is unchanged. I really liked the angled "cat like" headlights, flared fenders and lower than the Altima trunk line.
In my opinion the 6 looks best with the Sports Package. The 17" wheels, side sills and spoiler do give the car a much sportier look. Keeping with the... well I'll avoid the "ZZ" phrase! ;) 
Moving on..

<b>Get In</b>

The interior of the 6 has been gone over in other reviews. I'll touch on a few things that got an immediate nod from me. The shape of the steering wheel might seem petty at first. But since I keep my hands on it all the time, it matters to me. The 3 point wheel is more attractive to me than most designs. It also allows for a natural feeling "10 and 2" hand position. Stereo controls on the steering wheel are very nice and easy to use. On the right side are cruise options. Again, easy to use and all buttons are lit for night use as well! Nice touch. The turn signal and wiper arms are also a nice length, easy to use and feel natural flipping with extended fingers. The dash lights and information panel also have options to keep the illumination bright and/or dim whether the lights are on or not. With a multi-level dim option when the lights are on. I have the upgraded Bose stereo which has a nice sound, but won't "wow" audiophiles. I've noted very good stereo separation though. The lack of an upgradeable audio option may turn off some. The non-Bose option can at least have amps and/or speakers added. I understand the Bose system is best left alone due to its unique wiring and electrical properties. Cup holders were sorely lacking and deficient in my Grand Am. The 6 has plenty and are usable for both righties and south paws! Front doors each have one along with 2 in the center console. The rear has a nice flip down arm rest with 2 holders there. I also have the Leather Package which is my first vehicle with this material. Leather is a bit slippery, but the seats are certainly comfortable and the fronts are heated. Eight way power positioning and a small ratchet type lumbar support makes the seats kinda like a Select Comfort Bed! It may take a while to find right spot. But when you do, it'll be pretty comfortable!

<b>Clutch, Shift, Gas!</b>

My 6 is the "S" version sporting the 3.0L V6 mated to the standard 5 speed. I did drive the automatic (it was 2003) and didn't find it as "peppy" as the manual. The engine, while not as "fast" as the Altima is still no slouch! As stated in other reviews, it's a bit "peaky". Meaning the power comes on more as the revs get higher. The "throttle by wire" concept perhaps hasn't reached its maturity yet. Some have complained of "throttle lag" or delay. It's noticeable but not a real problem. A possible fix is posted on a few fan sites which involve grounding the throttle to the battery. I haven't tried it yet, but might. Standard Traction Control functions... well interestingly? I've never had a vehicle with TCS, but this seems to work well. It snowed a week after my purchase. Wet, snow and ice all need to be approached gently to begin with! So I <b>didn't</b> expect the TCS to be a magic tank tread to plow me through at high speed. A small dash light gives indication of wheel spin and the system kicks in (I'm not sure if brakes are applied or power is just cut) to reduce said spin. Again, a light foot in slick conditions is needed regardless.
Aftermarket support is slow but there. A few companies have some performance parts in the form of intakes, headers and some eye candy parts with more to come. If you're a tuner or just a family guy who's more like a "tuner wannabe" (like me) the 6 should prove to be a good platform to mess with.

<b>Curvy</b>

Ride and Stability seem to be a nice mix of sport and comfort. Only when pulling around a tight corner at slightly above "safe" speeds does the size of the 6 make itself apparent. A little body roll and a rear drift threat are warning signs. Just make sure you have all articles in the back or trunk secure or they'll slide around! (note: Mazda offers a nice trunk net, cargo tray and trunk liner for the dirty stuff! Prices for these seem reasonable as well.) I'd like to see a few upgraded suspension parts in the form of rear and front sway bars etc.. Some folks have lowered the 6. I guess one needs to draw a line on performance and comfort. Lowering is not for me. 
Tires. The Michelin Pilots perform well in all weather. As stated above, through the snow the tires did ok. I haven't pushed much in the rain, however traction seems adequate.

<b>Look Out, I'm Packin'</b>

The cavernous trunk was one of many selling points for me. Coupled with the split fold down seats, the 6 has more storage capacity than I think I'll ever need. I've already put a 18" Mountain bike IN the car with the trunk closed! And I didn't have to take the wheel off!
The front storage isn't remarkable. But certainly acceptable. 
Speaking of packing.. For trips, the 18 gallon gas tank is much appreciated. I've averaged about 23 miles to the gallon all around so far and have only about 1000 miles on the clock. Mazda did a great thing allowing the 6 to keep with 87 octane gas as well. The Altima (V6) requires the more expensive 93 grade.

<b>Summary</b>
I'm lovin the 6 of course! Being able to do some mods (or not), pack the family for a trip, beat the highway daily and possibly even take it to the track doesn't give much room for complaint! 
Insurance wise, the 6 was cheapest of all the vehicles I considered. 
I'd recommend visiting Mazda6club.com to get a lot of info if you are looking to buy a 6. It's a nice site with lots' areas to cover including local "meets" all over the country. There's an enthusiastic 6 community that are eager to answer questions.
