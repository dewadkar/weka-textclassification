            I am the happy owner of a 1992 Toyota Extra Cab pickup.  Let me give you a bit of background on what this vehicle has survived.

This truck was purchased when I was 17, in late 1998.  It originally had 91,000 miles on it, with a current 174,000 miles on it.  There was no body damage, no interior damage, and definitely no engine problems.  This vehicle looked like it just came out of the factory.

In this time I have had this truck, I have managed 3 wrecks.  Only one was major, having been t-boned by a teenage running an intersection doing 60 mph.  I drove away from that without a hiccup.

There have been two water pumps replaced, and the clutch has now been done only once that I know of.  I have driven this little pickup like Mario Andretti every day that I have had it and I still can not kill it!  I want a newer vehicle (another Toyota, of course), but I refuse to buy one until this little wonder stops running.

Will this day ever come?  I hope not.  Writing this article reminds me that I haven't changed the oil in it for about 3 months (8000 miles?).  I do check the oil at least once a week, and it still does not burn.

If you need a dependable vehicle to get you to work/school every day without a hiccup, a Toyota pickup is that vehicle.

If you are looking for a vehicle for your soon to be licensed son/daughter, you can trust a Toyota pickup.
