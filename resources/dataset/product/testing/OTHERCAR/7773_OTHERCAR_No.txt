            I took delivery of my 2001 325Ci about a year and a half ago.  Steel gray with leather, sunroof, xenon headlights, and a CD player.  I absolutely fell in love with the styling and I also liked the fact that this is one of the few coupes available with rear wheel drive and a manual transmission.  This is the first new car I�ve ever owned and unfortunately for me after the "newness" wore off I began to see the vehicle�s faults.  The biggest gripe I have is the electronic throttle.  This car does not have a throttle cable, but rather uses the gas pedal as a sensor which the computer reads and then actuates a stepper motor on the throttle body.  What does this mean?  A short but very perceivable and very annoying lag between the time you step on the gas and when the engine actually responds.  With an automatic you�d never notice it, but with a 5-speed it makes for some rough driving when shifting.  Double clutching for a downshift is especially difficult.  I�m also concerned this will cause premature clutch failure as the amount of throttle required to raise the rpm is grossly inconsistent and it�s all too easy to end up seriously slipping the clutch.  The situation becomes even worst when running the AC.  BMW�s response to this is basically �you bought the car, so tough.�  In fact BMW never once asked me, either in writing or by phone, what I thought of their vehicle.  This is in stark contrast to their great concern for your satisfaction with their overpriced service.  By the way, the first 30,000 miles of free maintenance is a gimmick, as it is only covers two oil changes.  I really can�t overstate how much this problem detracts from the overall driving experience of this car.  To put it bluntly, I used to like driving stick; with this car it�s become a chore.  It�s a shame because I was planning on keeping this car for a long time (my last vehicle was a �91 MR2 that I racked up 200,000 miles on) but with only 25K on the clock I�m already thinking about selling it.

My other complaints are more subtle and likely subjective.  The seats are made for a 98 pound woman, or possibly a 115 pound Frenchman.  I�m not overweight by any stretch of the imagination, yet I end up sitting on top of the side bolsters of the lower seat.  You don�t notice it much at first but on a long drive it is very fatiguing.  Strangely enough I�ve never had this problem with the various Japanese cars I�ve previously owned.  This car has the dirtiest brake pads I�ve ever seen.  The wheels never stay clean for long.  The base stereo would be considered mediocre in a Cavalier.  Granted you can spend $700 and upgrade to the Harmon/Kardon but a $30,000 car should have a decent stereo to begin with.  BMW also touts their �VANOS� system (similar to Honda�s VTEC) but I�m honestly not impressed with it.  Sometimes it seems to work, giving strong torque down low and still pulling cleanly to the redline, but more often than not the engine feels lifeless below 4000 rpm.  Other little stuff includes a gas filler which is on the wrong side (passenger) of the car, and a clock that doesn�t do a good job of keeping accurate time.

In conclusion, if you are looking for a fun to dive car I strongly suggest you look elsewhere.  Likewise, I won�t be buying any more BMWs.  If you valve form over function you�ll probably very happy with the E46 3 series.  Just get one with an automatic.
