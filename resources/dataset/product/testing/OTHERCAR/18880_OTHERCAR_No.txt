            I owned a 1991 Mitsubishi Eclipse GSX, all wheel drive turbo, for 3 years.  My personal experience with this car was one of great frustration, and extremely high expense.  During my three years of ownership, my GSX was plagued with problems, very expensive problems.  The problems started 3 months after I purchased the car when the timing belt broke (while driving) and consequently bent all the exhaust valves in the process!  I made the mistake of taking the car to a small garage who assured me they could fix the problem.  One month, and $1357 dollars later, I got the car back and quickly realized it was not fixed right. The car vibrated like a bad washing machine, and I knew this was just not right. The local shop insisted that nothing was wrong and that the car drove like that before the repair. Wrong answer!! So, I took the car to a Mitsubishi service shop who quickly assesed the problem (incorrectly installed timing belt and left outer CV shaft not properly secured!) and fixed it for $600!!   So, within three months of owning this car I had already sunk almost $2000 in repairs. I was not off to a good start with this little car.  From that point forward the car was in the dealer shop atleast once every 3 to 4 months for relatively major repairs.  During my ownership of this car I had the following parts replaced: timing belt and valves, alternator and battery, head gasket, brakes (twice), calipers, tires replaced TWICE, water pump, head gasket again (due to water pump failure), fuel pump, headlamp motor, vacuum hoses, radiator, radiator hoses, throttle body, fuel sensor, fuel tank, emergency brake cable, plugs and wires, and valve cover gasket.  All done and said, I spent almost $10,000 in repairs in a mere 3 years of ownership.  This was in addition to my normal car payments and insurance. Suffice to say, this was the most unreliable and expensive car that I have owned, to date.  
Although my car could probably have been considered a lemon due to the sheer magnitude of parts failure, I have known 3 other persons who have owned either an Eclipse or sister car Eagle Talon, and all 3 have suffered elevated instances of parts failures. It is an expensive to keep running!  
The car was fast and fun to drive, when it worked.  But, it stranded me atleast 3 times and spent far too much time in the shop for me to ever consider touching one of these cars again. My advice to those interested in buying one:  First, make sure the timing belt has been replaced within 60k intervals. Second, plan for expensive repairs. Third, perhaps consider another car!!!
