            Drives smoothly, sports around quickly, easy to park, fun to drive!  It comes with a built in CD player and plenty of bells and whistles for everything under the sun.  Rear window defogger and windshield wipers are nice.  A/C and defrost work perfectly!  I researched this car extensively prior to purchase.  We needed something bigger than a small car with room to transport items.  It turned out to be a great vacation vehicle.  We like the split back seats which allows either or both back seats to be individually layed down for more space in traveling or transporting items.  This vehicle ranges below 20,000 american dollars and is a real deal for the price.  The downside is the lack of pickup when trying to pass someone; in retrospect we would have moved up to the grand suzuki which has more pickup.  You can use the "power" button when needed that extra pickup.  The service provided is impeccable.  The Vitara has a warranty that saves you lots of money.  We had some gliches and problems that were taken care of with ease and cost us NOTHING because it was all covered in the warranty.
