            After 12 years of family style cars (3 Jeeps) I made a dramatic move and leased a Jetta.  My oldest son gets his license soon and my second son won't be far behind, so I no longer felt compelled to buy a vehicle to carry around the whole town!  

I leased a 4-door, Jetta GL two years ago and I just love it.  I insisted on a Standard transmission (just my personal preference) and I had them put on the alloy wheel covers, install a 6-disc CD changer in the trunk,
A/C, and sunroof.  The change in my gas mileage from driving a 4WD all the time is incredible and even though it's only a 4-cylinder, it is very peppy.  

It's so easy to park.  I can always squeeze into those little spots that the big SUVs can get into.  Even though it's a much smaller car than I was used to, it's quite comfortable.  The trunk is huge (hold 5 golf bags comfortably, 6 if you squish them in.

Recommend this car for anyone who likes to drive a snappy little vehicle, that's fun to drive and easy to maintain!<br><br>
