            I had been driving a 1995 Ford Escort for the last 3 years during high school, and now that it was time to get a new car for college, i decided to get a pickup. I looked around at almost every kind of truck and decided that I wanted a nice looking compact pickup. The Dodge Dakota R/T stood out from the others because of its 17&quot; rims and lowered look. So after some convincing, my mom decided that it was time for me to own an R/T. 

At first, I thought that the 5.9L 360 was going be way too much engine for me and that I couldn't handle it. Boy was I wrong. Dodge did a great job with the design and the R/t drives like a dream. It was plenty of power, without overdoing it. The suspention is great as well. It rides similar to a luxury car. The 17&quot; by 9&quot; tires hug the road unbelievably well. I have tried to take a few turns faster than I thought possible, but the R/T takes them without even the mildest chirp or possibility of traction loss. The ABS brakes also do a great job stopping in the rain.

This truck is for anyone who enjoys a smooth ride and plenty of beef under the hood if needed. I love this truck and I plan to keep it as long as possible.
