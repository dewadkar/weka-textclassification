<TEXT>
            I own a 1992 Buick Le Sabre. My father bought it brand new in '92, and I bought it from him in '97. It's maroon with maroon interior and wood accents. This car is the most comfortable I have ever ridden in, test drove, or just sat in. If you love your favorite recliner, you'll love driving a Buick! This is a V-6 with the guts of a V-8. You want to go some where? It'll go on command! We've had very little problems outside of regular maintenance, and things you would expect to find after 8 years and 95,000 miles! Very solid car and I will probably keep it until it dies. My dad always said &quot;if you love and take care of your car, it will take care of you&quot; and I think my Buick love me too!<br><br>
