            I didn't have a lot of choices when I bought my 1991 Acura Integra hatchback, but I can certainly say that I have not been at all disappointed. The car that I own currently has one hundred and thirty thousand miles on it, but it drives very well. 

For a car that is almost ten years old, it has splendid fuel economy. Around town I average at about twenty-five miles to the gallon. On the highway, about thirty-five.

If you're into music, it might be a good idea to look into a new system for this car. My two door model has no rear speakers. The front speakers serve my purposes but if you want to be heard, they just won't do. The standard 1991 Integra comes with an AM/FM stereo tape player. You can easily replace that with a compact disc player if you would like.

I do have a small problem with my electrical ignition. Sometimes I get a slow start, but its not often, and it doesn't keep me from getting where I need to go. Other than that, my biggest problem is finding a place to put my drink.

If you want to drive this car during the summer, be prepared to roll the windows down, especially if your car is a darker color. The Honda/Acura air conditioning system is not the greatest. In fact, it doesn't even make a dent in the hundred degree days of July and August.

For the masculine driver, I recommend the five-speed manual transmission. I have one, and it's just plain fun. There are also obvious advantages to this such as a lower initial cost of the vehicle and better fuel economy. However for you feminine drivers who don't like fooling with the gearshift, you can get an automatic with cruise control and all that other good stuff.

Overall, I highly recommend this car to anyone who is looking for ease in travel as opposed to cargo room, although the trunk is rather large and the hatchback is very convenient.<br><br>
