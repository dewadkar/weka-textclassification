            Is there anything this car can't do? I have owned my car for five years now and it's still in great condition.  Not only does it run excellent, but it still looks in style.  The ride is great, smooth and wonderful control.  This car is dependable and will be able to withstand long drive to work or traveling on vacation.  My car has survived repeated trips to work and school, both an hour away from my house, and is style working great.  If you want a more sporty look to the Camry, some have sun roofs, spoilers, V6's, and gold trims.  I recommend this car to anyone who wants a car that will last (trading at 100,000 is not even thought about!) at an affordable price.<br><br>
