            Now, I think that MR2's, the 1990 to 1995 models, are the easiest things to drive in the world. I have to tell you that I had never driven a stick before. I went to go buy a car in Portland and I found a 1993 Toyota MR2. I asked the dealer if I could have my dad drive it because I didn't know how to drive a stick. The deal said <i>&quot;No you're going to learn right now&quot;</i>. So we got in the car and drove away. I only killed it once. I tried to start out in 3rd gear instead of 1st. When I got back to the dealership dad asked what took so long. I told him that I was taking my new car for a drive.
Any way, I bought the car for $7999 and drove it home that night. The Toyota MR2s are an easy car to drive and they are safe. One of the safest things about them is that the engine is right behind the driver. That puts the center of gravity in the center of the car. That makes the car easier to right in a spin. It also makes the car have a tighter turning radius.
There are other good things about the car too. Like I've said that they are easy to learn how to drive them. The clutch is easy to use and the car seems like it's a pound.
The only bad thing about the car is that the Toyota lost the quick snapping gear shift that they had in the older model.<br><br>
