            My wife bought a Mitsubishi Montero Sport XLS because I have the big car, and I take it to work.  She needed to take the kids around and have a reliable car.  The Mitsubishi Montero Sport is very attractive and the chrome grill catches many eyes.  The Mitsubishi Montero Sport has very sturdy doors and close softly so you don't have to slam the door.  It has many attractive features such as a mirror that senses headlights behind you and automatically dims the rear view mirror.  
The XLS model that my wife drives has comfortable chairs and a very powerful air conditioner.  It includes overhead dome lights, front seat reading lights, driver and passenger air bags, fog lamps, and many more features.  The front and back seats are very roomy and both have cup holders.  There are two front cup holders. One small and one large one capable of holding a cup with a handle. 
The control panel is a little hard to get used to.  The light switches are on the left control stick and the windshield wipers on the right control stick.  The AC button is under the AC/Heat knobs and has a picture of a snowflake on it.  When we first got the car, we saw the button, and thought it had a picture of a light on it.  We then assumed it was the fog lamp button and pushed it out to turn it off right before we got out of the car.  The next time we got in it, the only air it would give it hot air.  We read the manual and figured it out.  The lock buttons on the driver and passenger sides are a little hard to use also.  They have a picture on a key in the middle of the button. There is no plus or minus sign or picture at the top of the button.  It is relatively easy to park though.  
When driving it, it rides incredibly smooth and comfortable.  It does not have very much, if any, pick-up at all.  When driving it, if you want to speed up, you have to shift into third, and then back to drive.  It also does not turn that great.  U-Turns seem hard for it.  Otherwise, it is a great car.  If you want a smooth riding car that will catch eyes, has a lot of room, and has great features, then this is the car for you.  Good luck finding the right car for you!
