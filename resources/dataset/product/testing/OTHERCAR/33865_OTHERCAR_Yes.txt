            We purchased our used Mercury Villager when we realized that with a family of five, we needed a larger vehicle. After test-driving many, many used mini-vans, and comparing prices on all, we chose the Villager for the overall value.

We consistently have gotten 21-22 MPG whether in town or on the interstate. The van has captains chairs in the middle seats, providing a separate seat for each of the three children -- no screaming &quot;he's touching me!&quot; on long trips! The van drives very much like a car as opposed to a larger vehicle (it sits lower to the ground than most mini-vans). 

For an older model vehicle, the Villager has several &quot;modern&quot; features that we did NOT find in other mini-vans of that &quot;age.&quot; -- automatic headlights (have NEVER turned the lights &quot;on&quot;); back vent/windows open with the touch of a button above the driver's seat; driver's seat has a variety of electric functions allowing each driver to personalize lumbar support, seat height, seat tilt, etc.; an extra glove box under the passenger's seat. 

Seat configurations: excellent flexibility! Middle captains chairs can be removed and stored at home, allowing the back seat to slide forward leaving a huge storage/hauling area in the back. One drawback: the captains chairs are very heavy and cumbersome to remove -- almost need two people to remove them without self-injury!

Overall, the Villager has proved an excellent purchase for our family and is still going strong with over 125,000 miles!<br><br>
