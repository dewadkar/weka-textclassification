            All it took me was fifteen minutes behind the wheel of this car to fall in love with it. A friend of my dad's got hooked up with the TT convertible by his neighbor who owns the local Audi/Porsche dealership. Thinking of the fact that i was a car enthusiast, he stopped by and we took it for a spin. The manual transmission was able to shift gears flawlessly, with little spurts of power coming from the engine every time i shifted the stick, which made it seem as if we were going a lot faster than we were. The one thing i like about this car is that it gets attention more than anything else. At a street crossing, we pulled up alongside an Acura NSX, and still, everyone was staring at the TT as if they had never seen the likes. Which is robably because this car has radical styling. I think that without a doubt it is the best-styled car to come along in the past decade, and perhaps one of the best ever. The cockpit of this car is equally stylish. The black leather seats are adequtely comfortable, while the chrome trim that is abound in the car goes along very well with the silver paint job (highly reccomended). There is even a cool &quot;TT&quot; chrome plate that slides away to reveal the sound system. If there is anything wrong with this car, it is the engine. Forget the turbo, just the thought of driving a luxo-convertible that shared an engine with a Volkswagen Beetle is disturbing. Second of all, the suspension is ridiculously stiff. I spilt my cappuccino all over my shorts while driving over the potholes on my street. Despite some minor imperfections, the TT is a great car with a great ride and awesome styling, but i still think the Porsche Boxster S is the best German roadster available.   <br><br>
