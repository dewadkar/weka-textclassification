            I think everyone who is on the fence about owning a Jeep Wrangler should have one at least once.  It seems that this vehicle is one that get's a lot of &quot;I'll buy one someday...&quot; comments.  There is no in between, people that have owned them either love them or hate them.

I have owned mine for slightly over a year.  I had it custom built.  My reasoning for this is that I wanted a Wrangler with every possible option.  However, the top-end model (the Sahara) only comes in limited colors, and only comes with hideous pea-green seats.  This is a major problem for someone who doesn't like green, but I digress.  So I ordered the next model down (the Sport) with every conceivable factory and dealer option.  The price I paid was just over $25K.  This is the start of Chrysler's &quot;option game&quot;.

I have always had very strong doubts about the Chrysler Corporation.  And believe me, this would be the only vehicle I would ever even consider purchasing from that company.  Anyone I have ever known with a Chrysler product has had nothing but problems, and the vehicles that I owned from them several years ago had nothing but problems.  So this was definately a hesitant decision.  Next time you see a car broke down on the highway.  Look, is it a Chrysler product?

My overall feel of the Wrangler since I have owned it can be summed up in one sentence.  The quality is not there.

The vehicle was late coming in.  Later I found that the Quality Assurance dept had found &quot;paint problems&quot; as it was leaving the factory.  Apparently, after it's extended two week stay at the factory, it wasn't rectified because it had a dig in the clearcoat on the front fender.  The buying experience is, as with other Chrysler products, annoying.  Every little thing is optional.  Even in the year 2000, Chrysler still makes a big deal of their cupholders.  I have owned a 1991 Mazda Protege that just had things in it that you can take for granted, like cup holders, locking glove compartment,map lights, radios etc.  I found myself haggling over alternators with the Chrysler Dealership.  Do I want carpeting or not?  Do I want a back seat?  Interval wipers? Why can't they just include the &quot;Sentry Key&quot; (that's where the key has a computer chip in it) price ($75) in the price of the car like everyone else?  This is the year 2000, my Ford Explorer came with it standard two years ago! Then there is the &quot;Package&quot; nonsense. At one point I was so agrivated I just asked that they build the car in full and let me know how it turns out.  The Sahara comes with carpeting that goes on the sides where the driver's left foot and the passenger's right foot go.  However, on my Sport, there is an exposed body colored painted panel on both sides.  Why?  WHY?  Why can't we finish building the car?  It is not even available as a option.

As far as the engineering:

Something needs to be done with the windshield.  With 22K miles, my windshield is more pitted than the windshield on my Mazda with 115K miles.  It has already chipped and even cracked in one place.  I don't know how they are made, but a design change is in need.  And while we are talking design change.. The dashboard- WHAT HAPPENED?  Gone are the days of spread out gauges.  Now the dash and instruments are more remnicant of the Suzuki Samurai.  Everything is squished together into a &quot;isn't this cute&quot; mess.  It feels MUCH more cramped than the 1980's Jeeps.  The digital milage will not display in kilometers.  When you start it, the starter has a &quot;I'm a little tiny cute car&quot; sound.  Let's go with something beefier next time around. Why can't the cruise control buttons light up? It would be nice if there were map lights under the rear view mirror.  It's dark up front, unless you read your map on the floor.  The light in the hardtop is so dim it is useless. The rear wiper is either on or off.  There are no speeds.  There are no intervals.  Why not? The turn signals in the front do this cute little &quot;side to side&quot; thing at night. The dashboard sends out one little beep if a warning light goes on.  This is fine if you are in a limo, but there is no way I can hear it when it beeps on the highway (i.e. low fuel/brakes etc.) it needs to be louder. And while we are on that, the sound system should have &quot;speed sensitive volume&quot; like the Ford Explorer. People that ride in my Jeep Wrangler, as well as myself, have both of their arms for the most part.  Maybe someone at Chrysler can tell me where my left elbow is supposed to go when I am driving, or where the passenger's right elbow should go.  I am not a large man and there is only about an inch or two between my body and the door. Unless the window is down and you can rest it on the ledge, you are out of luck.  Is there any particular reason we can't make it wider??? The middle armrest is too low and far back.  Why is there so much scheduled maintainance in this day and age? And why can't we fit 5 in it instead of 4?  The parking brake does not hold unless you REALLY pull it up.  I have had it back 3 times for a squeal in the steering column.  It still exists. The radiator, as far as I can tell, is totally exposed.  This is evident because of the dents and debris that are lodged within the fins. A guard over the front would be good.  The rear seatbelts are actually wearing through from contact with the retractor housing when the belts flap when the top is off. The front belts are so close to the door post that they get caught in them.  The front belts also get caught in the seat recline handle when wearing them. The trunk is almost nonexistant with the &quot;soundbox&quot; option. The paintjob was sloppy.  It has plenty of rattles and doesn't feel as tight as a one year old vehicle should.

Driving it:

The 4.0 six doesn't immediately feel like the strongest engine, but if you give it the whats-for it can take off pretty good for a truck.  I will say that Chrysler needs to make some changes to the engine.  I have never (my full size Bronco included) seen a vehicle consume so much fuel.  It is an absolute pig at the gas station.  I have the extended (19 gallon) tank.  Commuting in my Mazda I go a whole week to work and one way back before I am on empty.  The Jeep goes two days and one way back.  It doesn't matter, slow or fast, easy or hard, city or highway.  It still sucks it down as fast as you can put it in.  The heat can be described in two words.  Barely Adequate.  On as high as it will go, the heat is very hot, but the cabin just doesn't get too far above tolerable.  Same goes for the A/C.  I assumed there would be a little button to raise and lower the top.  Wrong.  It is about a 12 minute job to zip/unzip the windows and raise/lower the top.  The hard top takes two people to put on or take off.  I just leave the soft top down all summer and use a cover at night.  I don't use it in bad weather.  It would be best with a garage and second car.  The hard top goes on in the winter.  The plastic windows scratch extremely easily.  The noise isn't as bad as you would expect, but it certainly isn't quiet.  The engine misses a beat here and there at idle.  It certainly does not sound like a new car.  It can toss you around on rough roads but is pretty smooth on the highway.  If you want a Cadillac, buy a Cadillac.  The brakes are ok.  The ABS (which I have had problems with) can be tricky if it activates on a bumpy road.  It then turns into- let up and take longer to stop, or stomp on them (as Chrysler suggests) and stop sudden when you were not originally planning to.  Generally, it feels safe, I am not entirely ready to say that it is predictable, but it suprises me with some of it's capabilities.  You definately won't get away with whispering on the highway.

Presentation:

I give Chrsler an A+ for effort.  They are always sending me books full of Jeep merchandise, coupons for service, and invitations for little get togethers.  I went to one called &quot;Jeep 101&quot; where they show you how to drive offroad.  Great idea!  The Jeep came with a video that shows how to put the top up and down and other important stuff.  Great again!  Going in for service has turned into more of a social call than a trip to the Car Doc.  They have an 800# for me to call if something bad happens.  All good.  My car even said &quot;This vehicle built especially for &lt;My Name&gt;&quot; on the window sticker when I bought it.  Nice nice nice.  Smiles all around.

Summary:

Chrysler tries hard, but they need to get fresh ideas in the engineering department.  Tweak it more in the quality department.  It's fun to drive, I definately don't regret buying it, but I don't think I'll run right out to get one for my next new car.  The soundsystem with boombox is nice.  I have the CD/CASSETTE in-dash combo.  You have to nag for it because it was not available as an option.  It is from the Cherokee.  It is an absolute blast in the summer and reliable for winter's nastiness.  I wouldn't buy one if you have a car right now.  If you have a truck and you don't mind keeping your coffee below the half way mark on your way to work I would give it a try.  If you put a carseat in the back or kids in the back, it is somewhat of a pain to get back there.  I don't think anyone would truely regret getting one but it would determine if you are a diehard Jeep fan when it's time to trade it in.
