            This is one very solid little device. It looks great, it takes great pictures & most importantly you can carry it everywhere in your pocket. I've taken many pictures with it now and we sent some out for development & got back film quality 5x7 using its normal mode. 

I find it easy to use, it has a slide show feature so you can hook it up to a TV and look through the pictures which is kind of neat. I just can't get over the quality of picture it takes in combination with the small size. The 2x optical zoom works very well. I don't recommend anyone use the digital zoom as the result is pretty horrible. 

The PC Zoom browser software is a pretty nice include. It seems pretty solid on my W98 system. 

My brother-in-law spent the same amount I did, but got a big bulky 3 MegaPixel camera with a larger screen. But it is so bulky he hardly ever uses it.

With the 128MB CompactFlash card I added, it can hold like 230 pictures in normal resolution, so I don't even have to download the images but once in a while. In this case Eight is NOT enough - the 8MB card is not big enough, only holding a few images (16 or so I think.) 

Here is what you give up (IMO) for having the camera be such a small size: Better optical zoom (3x or 4x), longer battery life (but I find the battery MORE than adequate for my needs), and a few mostly useless features I've seen on other cameras (like cropping picture while on camera.)

The one thing that I don't like about this camera is the delay when you try to turn it on. You have to wait a couple of seconds which can mean a missed a shot. Of course, most cameras I would miss the shot anyway because I would not have wanted to lug it in the first place.

A pretty rugged camera too. My daughter dropped it yesterday about 2.5 feet on to a hard surface and it was just fine.
