            I've leased my Toyota RAV4 since 1998 and the longer I drive it the more I love it.  In fact, this is perhaps the first vehicle that I've leased in 10 years of leasing that I'm considering buying at lease end.

I originally leased this vehicle because I wanted something that was easy to get into (step up instead of step down), something that had sufficient storage space in the back and that was easy to load, something that was good in most weather conditions, and something that was good on gas.

The RAV4 has lived up to all of those &quot;wants&quot; and more.  Reliability has been superior.  I average about 21 miles p/gallon in the city.  I enjoy the outdoors, and I have driven this vehicle in Maine and New Jersey in mud and snow and have never had a problem with traction.

The ride is fairly smooth and responsive (nimble).  Ground clearance with the standard 16&quot; tires is excellent and provides unobstructed views of the road.  Entry and exit to and from this vehicle is comfortable without running boards, which I find annoying on most SUVs.

On the negative side, there is some interior cabin noise, and although my wife and I are comfortable in the front seat, the rear seating area is very small and really suitable only for small children on long drives.

My wife and I like driving this vehicle and would highly recommend it to family and friends.<br><br>
