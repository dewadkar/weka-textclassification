            This Is my opinion on my new 2000 cavalier.I bought the car new and when I put 1,800 miles It had already used 5quarts of oil.And It was only 3 weeks old.
I had called my dealer and they told me to take it to my nearest Chevrolet dealer.So I did and I had explain what was going on with my car and they told me that I had to put money up front.Keep in mind I had bumper to bumper warranty on it and there was no way was I putting money up front on this.
Well the next day I took my car back to the Dealer where I bought It from and when I got there I set and talked with the man that I had went through when I had got the car.My car was only three weeks old and I had ask him to just give me another car and he said I cant do that.

I will say I may be a female but I know a new car should not of used 5 quarts of oil.Well they put 2 new part on my car and changed my oil and and told me to bring it back If I had any more problems with It.

I do love my car but I can say the service I got was rude and uncalled for.
