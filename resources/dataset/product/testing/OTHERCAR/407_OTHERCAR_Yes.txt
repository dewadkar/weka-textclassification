            In September, 1999, I decided it was time to trade off the old car, and
get something new and different.  I am a loyal Nissan customer, having had
very good experience with the Nissan pickup truck's (owned 3 different
ones over the years), so I originally went to the Nissan dealer looking at
the Maxima, which I was going to buy, but when I saw the Xterra on the
show room floor, I thought &quot;hey, might as well check it out&quot;.  I was so
impressed, that I bought it right off the show room floor.   I didn't think I needed a sports utility vehicle, but it is so much fun driving.
It handles great, the visability is better than any car, and like the
commercial says - has everything you need, nothing you don't.<br><br>
