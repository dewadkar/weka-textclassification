            I had an Astro van from 1988 through 1998 and found it a good vehicle. For much of that time I owned a Catalina 22 sailboat which weighed over 3000 pounds. My Astro had the heavy duty towing package and pulled this large boat with ease. I had the traction control rear end which I highly recommend for boat owners. The traction control really helped pull that big boat out of the water on wet boat ramps. The traction control is almost as good as four wheel drive in snow country. That Astro had the deluxe interior which was very comfortable. 

That 1988 Astro was reliable, but I did have to replace the motor and overhaul the transmission at 120,000 miles. It was sold in 1998 with 250,000 miles and still running well.

This summer my family of three decided to drive from Austin, Texas to the big airshow at Oshkosh WI. We elected to rent a 2000 Astro van from National Rentacar. We put 3049 miles on this van during our vacation. 

We have rented Ford Windstars on several occasions, but since this was a 13 day trip that involved a lot of camping we wanted the more truck-like Astro.  The Windstar gets better mileage and I think that Ford does a better job on interiors, but the Windstar is a large car and an Astro is a small truck.  If you need more room and serious tow capablity then the Astro may be better for you than the Windstar.

The first Astro we picked up had about 10,000 miles but it was not satisfactory. It was running rough, the controls for the electric mirror didn't work, and several interior panels were loose and rattling. I don't know if a previous renter just tore it up or what, but it was disappointing to have so many little problems with such a new car. National had no problem letting us swap this Van for another one with around 5000 miles. This van had dual air conditioning (a must in hot climates), power windows, and the standard 8 passenger interior.

This second van was in much better shape. The only problem with it was that a plastic panel had fallen off the right side of the center seat, exposing the insides of the seat to view. The National people told us that this particular panel always falls off after a few thousand miles. Very disappointing.

We removed the rear seat (not easy, but possible), loaded the van up and headed north on Interstate 35. 

This brings us to the major flaw in the Astro design. There is only limited foot room for the right front passenger due to the placement of the wheel well. It is imperative that any prospective purchasers check this out. A tall person, or person with large feet will not be comfortable for long periods of time in this seat.

We found the front seats to be comfortable, but the middle seats were just adequate. We really missed the deluxe interior of our 1988 Astro. There was a good interior light group installed.

Our 1988 Astro had two side hinged rear doors. This 2000 model had an elaborate 3 piece rear door, with a window hinged at the roof and two small side hinged doors below the window. This was a nice arrangement, but if I had a choice I'd get the two piece door and upgrade the seats.

The Astro is a powerful truck and had no problem holding 70mph all the way from Austin to Chicago. Our mileage ran around 18-19 miles per gallon, which was about the same as our 1988 model. The Astro has a very large fuel tank and has a range of around 450 miles. 

The Astro isn't a vehicle to turn heads, but it's a good product. The 190 horsepower Vortex V-6 is a solid proven motor. It is a comfortable vehicle if you can live with the limited right front seat foot room. It's a great tow vehicle when equipped with the heavy duty tow package and traction control rear end.
