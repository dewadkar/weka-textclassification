            My wife and I recently leased a 1999 Pontiac Grand Am SE. This is the base model with the 2.4 Twin Cam 16 Valve 150hp engine. We leased this car because we wanted a new, sporty car that we wouldn't have to pay for repairs on, and the monthly payment is way cheaper than if we had purchased it. We were also captivated by the new styling. I had also read that GM made the body much stiffer than the 1998 model, which was supposed to improve handling.

We love this car! It handles great and is very quick for a 4 cylinder automatic! The gas mileage is average for a 4 cylinder--about 22 mpg. We purchased the coupe because we do not have any kids yet, but we are regretting that because it's hard to haul our friends in. You can forget about leg room in the back. It's no worse than cars its size, but it's no better.

The options include daytime running lamps, fog lights, automatic lights, cruise control, intermittent wipers, AM FM cassette, power locks that lock when you put the car in gear, rear defrost, remote trunk release located on driver's door panel, automatic transmission, electronic traction control system, tilt steering, and a spoiler.

The best feature about this car is the handling. This car corners like it's on rails, and it's got better than average power. It can accellerate faster than average 4 cylinder cars such as the Camry and Civic, even if they have manual transmissions.

Trunk room is excellent. We can actually fit lots of stuff in there. The rear seat does not fold down or split, but it does in the more expensive model. There's surprisingly a lot of room in this car. I'm 6 ft. 4 in. tall, and I don't have any problems driving this car. I would like a slightly bigger car, but I can drive it comfortably.

The fit and finish on the interior is pretty good. The shifting console (the part that has the letters for the gears) moves a little when you shift. All of the buttons work well and feel solid. The climate control knobs feel solid, as do the radio buttons.  The sound quality of the radio isn't that great. The bass is distorted if turned up more than 3/4 of the way. The vent covers are the most solid feeling as I've ever seen. In other words, they don't feel like they are going to break when you touch them.

There are a few cool features on this model. The lights come on and turn off by themselves, so you never have to touch the light switch. The car tells you when to change the oil, which actually is more of an annoyance because every time you start the car, you are greeted with an extra few dings to let you know your your dealership wants to make more money.

The glove compartment cover doesn't look very sturdy. That and the crummy bass are about the only negative aspects of this car that I have noticed yet.

This car is fun to drive. There isn't any road noise, at least none that we can notice. The engine is slightly noisy when pushed.  The styling is awesome. The seats are very comfortable, and we've taken a few long (10 hr) road trips. The red, glowing instrument lights look cool as well.

The Grand Am drives like a dream in the snow too.  We recently had about a foot of snow dumped on us.  During a heavy snowstorm, we decided to go to the movies.  When we left the theater, the parking lot, drive and street had yet to be plowed, but the Grand Am had no trouble navigating through the deep snow.  Do you live atop a steep hill covered in ice?  It's no problem with this car.  We went right up with a little momentum. 

Overall my wife and I love this car. We have had very little problems with it so far. One word describes the 1999 Pontiac grand Am--fun.

I would recommend this car to single people or couples without children. If you want a sporty, head-turning car that won't break the bank but provides good performance, than purchase a 1999 or newer Pontiac Grand Am.

--UPDATE 07/19/00--

The vinyl on the passenger's side door is coming loose at the corner. It is really unsightly. I will have the dealership repair it in a few months when I take it in for the oil change. I'll let you know if they give me a hassle.

--UPDATE 09/14/00--

We took the car into the dealership today (18,500 miles) because the "Low Trac" light has been coming on for no reason, and the power steering took a dump. They fixed the "Low Trac" light (bad sensor) and some power steering parts and had to order an entire door panel to fix the loose vinyl. Everything was covered under warranty.

We also had a brake inspection done just to be safe. All seems well except that the front brakes are 60% gone and the rear brakes are 20% gone. I may not be a braking specialist, but either the front brake pads normally wear out 60% after 18,500 miles or I'm going to have to talk to my wife about her braking habits.

--UPDATE 10/19/00--

The dealership finally got the door panel in (I had to call them to find this out), and now the turn signal noise comes on for no reason.  We'll take the car in to have these fixed.

--UPDATE 01/03/01--

By the way, the turn signal thing quit a few days later and has yet to return.  *shrugs*

--UPDATE 06/06/01--

The left front CV boot ripped and had to be replaced (27,000 miles).  The hubcaps were replaced as well.  The hubcaps rattle like crazy because they don't fit very well.  The serviceman said the loose hubcaps were a design flaw, and they had a lot of complaints about them.  This was all covered under the warranty.  By the way, we were waiting for a call from the dealership for the parts.  Again, a week after they were supposed to call I had to call them.  Again, they had had the parts in for a while but forgot to call.

--UPDATE 10/31/01--

The care has been making this horendous squeeling noise for the past few months that the dealership is unable to locate.  It sounds like the breaks are gone and just squeels like crazy when driving.  We had the car looked at several times and the mechanics cannot figure it out.  I have this feeling they'll find it in about 5k miles when the warranty runs out.  Grrrr.

--UPDATE 01/30/02--

That squeeling was the brakes.  Don't ask my why they couldn't figure it out.

--UPDATE 02/27/02--

Recently, there have been a few electrical glitches.  Nothing major, mind you, but annoying just the same.  During cold weather, the clock will "freak out" and display incorrect times.  Also, on several occassions, when I started the car, the trunk popped open.  Then the car wouldn't start.  Turns out these were battery related.  The dealership replaced the battery with 34,000 miles on it for free.
