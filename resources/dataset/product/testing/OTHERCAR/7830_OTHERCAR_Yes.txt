            The 240SX is a car that many people don't know about, but it is a true sports car. This car is one of the most enjoyable cars I have driven; you want to drive this car just to drive it, not because you have to go somewhere. 

The 240SX is a superbly handling automobile. Taking sharp turns at 50 mph is no problem for this car. It is very tight around the turns, and in some cases takes them with such ease, you almost never want to drive on a straight road. This car seems to just 'float' around some curves, and the handling is so good that it feels like the tires are just stuck to the road. Driving this car is definitely more fun than riding on a rollercoaster. 

The engine is a 2.4L (hence 240) in-line four. You can get a single overhead cam version or a double overhead cam. Get the DOHC, it makes 155 horsepower compared to the single's 130. This is the same engine as the Altima. If you are looking to work on the car, some books may be marked only as Altima, but the engine is the same in the 240. This car is rear-wheel drive, so it deserves to have at least 200 horsepower. But, that is treading on the Z-car's space. Also, the engine it has gives it very even weight distribution. Even with only 155 horsepower, at about 3500 rpm, this car takes off like a rocket. It is very quick, but it is not insanely fast like a Supra or 300ZX. 

The interior is really only for two people. But, it is very comfortable for two people. The seats do a great job of holding you in, which is great because with a car like this, you're going to be pushing it to the limit. The climate and radio controls are very easy to understand, but if you buy or don't buy this car because of the radio, you have your priorities in the wrong order. 

In conclusion, this is an amazing sports car, and it is as satisfying as a BMW. It has great reliability as well. Another plus is insurance. My insurance doesn't charge very much for this car. The costs are nothing like a Supra or a 300ZX, even though this car is very similar, less the engine size. If you work on cars, buying a turbocharger for this car would be a great investment.
