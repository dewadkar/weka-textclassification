               I had admired VW Jetta's from afar for many months before finally deciding to test drive one.  I needed something dependable and economical on gas.  The first Jetta I tested was a VR6 and it was a great ride with a lot of power.  It was a '00 model, used, with only 4600 miles, but because it was used, a subsequent owner could only get half of the warranty. The price wasn't much lower than a new one, so I test drove a '00 V-4, 1.8L Turbo, the only other Jetta available in the dark green color.  I knew as soon as I got up to 60 miles per hour that this car was made for me. It had just as much power as the VR6 because of the turbo.  On the way home, after buying it, I passed a car on a back road and because of the power that I wasn't expecting, it felt like I was immediately molded into the seat!  I had to laugh because it was a very unexpected surprise!  
   The interior of the Jetta was very well planned. Everything is in a great location. The seats in front are very roomy and comfortable... Even more so than a Honda Accord. The leather package is a dream come true. The instrumentation is very interesting, not to mention the colors....Red for &quot;action&quot;, purple for &quot;Information&quot;. The first time I drove after dark, I felt like I was in the cockpit of an airplane.  It's a sight to behold! Has a huge trunk and lots of head room for taller people.  Love the 2 directional sunroof! Open or tilted.  
   Gas mileage=29mpg. Not a bad deal at all!
