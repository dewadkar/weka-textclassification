            I have a 1998 CR-V, and I love it!!!  It is just the right size for me and the kids.  Since I work full time in a professional position, I didn't want a &quot;mini-van&quot; yet, however having twins I needed a vehicle with easy access to both seats.  The CR-V is just perfect.
It drives just like a car, but is safer like a suv!  The real-time 4wd is wonderful, one less thing to think about.  It just switches for you.  I test drove the toyota, and by far the Honda passes it.  The Toyota Rav should be classified as a jeep, not a cute!  It was very bumpy, where the CR-V drive is much smoother.  Not ready for the minivan, and don't want a big SUV, then this will be perfect for you.  The price is worth every penny.<br><br>
