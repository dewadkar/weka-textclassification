            I've always wanted an Accord. Now I finally do. I absolutely love this car. My first car was a 1990 Camry V6. More powerful and smooth riding, the Camry lacked the handling capabilities of my Accord. But most of us should know by now this is a highly praised car. No questions asked. Afterall, "It's an Accord, man". This car is just plain fun to drive.

PROS
----
Handling is superb, even without mods. The ride is very smooth even at very high speeds and the car is extremely stable. Pot holes sound like soft "thumps", not loud "clanks".

The 4 banger is quite peppy since it comes with Honda's VTEC and a responsive automatic transmission. I don't drag but I have beat my friend's Passat VR6 from a redlight. Not to mention the fact that Honda's engines are renowned for power, refinement, cleaniness and more importantly: FUEL EFFICIENCY.

Build quality is exceptionally exceptional. Can I go any further? =) Or should I say, need I say more?

The interior is very ergonomical. All the switches and knobs are in the right place and visibility from the driver's seat is spectacular. I drive a Dodge Neon at work and I can hardly see out the back window plus the front roof support blocks my view as well.

You can't beat the price for these cars. I'm surprised Honda doesn't charge more for the Accords. This car gives you the most bang for your buck. Buy during clearance season and even Uncle Scrooge would approve.

Large trunk space and the remote trunk pop is very handy, especially since it's spring loaded so the trunk lid actually opens up half way. My roommate's Cavalier has it too, but it just unlocks the trunk. You still have to bend down and raise the trunk lid yourself (while at the same time watching the eggs at the top of your grocery stack do an olympic dive).

The cruise control is the smoothest I've ever used, plus it's mounted on the steering wheel (where it should be). You can increase and decrease speeds in increments of 1mph by pushing the accel/decel buttons once. The speed control also accelerates your car smoothly, and downshifts only when necessary. My old Camry's cruise control downshifted no matter how much you wanted to speed up.

The EX models come with a 10 second headlight delay feature. This feature turns your headlights off automatically after you have shut off the engine. This helps when wandering through a dark garage or parking lot. it also helps in case you forgot to turn your lights off.

The steering is precise and predictable, not spongy and full of free play (like Chevy Astro vans). You just point and the car goes. Thanks to the superb power steering, this car feels 200 pounds lighter than it actually is. But even though this car feels as light as a shopping cart, you're still connected to the road.

CONS
----
Wind and tire noise is high at speeds over 70mph (I guess we're not technically supposed to go that fast here in Ohio...) and on rough roads. Since the suspension is geared towards sports, you can feel minor ripples in the road much easier, but big bumps are smoothed out quite well.

The entire backseat folds down to expand your luggage space, at the cost of a passenger seating: no one can sit in the back. The advantage of a 60/40 folding rear seat is it allows you to fold down only what you need and still have a seat or two for other passengers.

1998-2000 models have a stereo with only a CD player & radio. I know CDs surpass old tapes, but some of us still have tapes. The 2001 model fixes that issue.

The high beam lever could use a redesign. one should be able to pull it towards you for flash-to-pass and to push it forwards to turn the high beams on. Right now, the flash-to-pass feature and high beams are both activated by pulling the lever towards you. What happens is that if you pull the lever too far, it turns the high beams on (you can get nasty looks from oncoming drivers passing you by if you're not paying attention).

No traction control. Due to the handling characteristics of this car, it slips rather easily in the winter. However the car is very predictable. The 2001 model fixes this issue with an added traction control option.

The interior light has a delayed dimming function, which is awesome (and it comes on when you unlock the car), however it dims a little too quickly. Good thing the ignition is illuminated longer.

IN THE END
----------
The cons are just small details that can be overlooked when you look at what the Accord really has to offer. This car gives you more than just a sunroof and good looks. It offers you peace of mind, knowing that it'll get you to where you need to go, and back. Safely, quickly, efficiently, and comfortably. My Accord may not offer 8 speakers, a subwoofer, and walnut trim but you just can't beat what it has to offer, especially when you see what it asks for in return. ;)
