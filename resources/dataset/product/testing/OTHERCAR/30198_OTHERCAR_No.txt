            We bought a Grand Caravan brand-spanking new in 1992.  It was terrific for about one year.  So many problems including: transmission (it lasted until the warrantee was over); electrical problems (constantly); the body is rusting even with rust proofing, the interior is also a piece of junk.  The moldings on the sliding door keep falling off.  We have replaced the screws over and over again ourselves because the dealers couldn't even get them to stay in.  The arms on the front seats are broken.  We are keeping it until it finally dies so no one else will get stuck with it.  We replaced the transmission.  Several of our friends have had the same problems with the Dodge and Chrysler mini-vans.  Watch out.  Families who need these vehicles can't afford to throw their money away on a piece of junk like this.<br><br>
