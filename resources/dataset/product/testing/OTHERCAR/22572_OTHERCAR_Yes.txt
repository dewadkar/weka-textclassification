            Some who may have taken the flight from D.C. to New York or various other short flights may have noticed that the plane they were flying on had the Saab emblem on it. In pre-1994 years, Saab 900's beared no resemblance to their airborne brothers. However, in 1994 to present, Saab has shown that they can make cars fly. The new 900 posseses all the features that one could possibly want in a car. They are a great value used as well. They lie in the 10,000 dollar range with 60,000 miles and are bound to race past the 200,000 mile mark with ease. Anyone who tells you otherwise has never done any research or driven a Saab. The new design brings european style into a potent and affordable form; and with a base engine that produces 150 horsepower and maxes out at around 130mph, it is exatly that. Also available are a V6 at 174 horsepower and a huge 4cyl. turbo in the mid 180's for horsepower. The V6 does zero to sixty in 7.5 seconds. The base fourcyl. follows it in the mid nines (low nines if you opt for the 5spd, manual). The automatic transmission has a really cool feature that adapts to the style of driving you wish to obtain. There is a sport mode that holds each gear extracting every ounce of speed from each gear, an economy mode for maximum gas milage, and a winter driving mode that reduces wheel slippage. 
      Like I said in the beginning, Saab is an aircraft company as well as a car company. In addition to the '94 900 being able to &quot;fly&quot; past the competition, the interior reminds me of the cockpit of an airplane. You are surrounded by easy to read and reach buttons that are all lighed which produces a stunning bragworthy specticle for your passengers. The seats are also state of the art, supportive and flexible with a head rest comparable to a posturpedic pillow. Another advantage of the Saab is the fact that it comes almost fully loaded. The only options are leather, sunroof and your choice of engine. This makes it so that no matter what Saab you get, it is likely to be the same as the others on the road, and better than the cars of your fellow motorists. 
     Perhaps my favorite thing about the Saab is its handling. The suspention is perfect for cruising on a open highway, or hitting turns at high speeds. There isn't a trace of body roll or wondering in the steering. In conclusion, this Saab is definately a car with the balls to challenge names like BMW, or Mercedes, in all the fields where they formerly ruled.
