                 When I started to shop for cars, I went nuts. I shopped around and decided I wanted a Jetta. The Jetta they offered was $21,000, white, had alloy wheels, sunroof, automatic, CD player and the &quot;lux. package&quot;; a GLS. The Jetta is small, however, if your not riding with more then 2 or 3 adults, it's very nice. I recommend it to small families, with 3 children or less. It's audio system is the best I've ever heard. It has excellent handling and has many useful features. One I'd like to mention, is that once you hit 10 MPH while driving, the doors automaticly lock. The windows/sunroof can automaticly open and close when you lock/unlock the car. Unlike many cars, if you tap on the side, they feel very &quot;tinny&quot;, but the Jetta is very solid and is very safe with side air bags.<br><br>
