            Strengths:

For the past 3 years we have owned a Chrysler Concorde (1996) and have
driven 51,000 miles.  The car drives and handles extremely well.   It has plenty of interior space and can seat 5 passengers comfortably, though a 6th person could squeeze in the front if you have bench seats.   Trunk space is more than adequate and can easily hold a set of golf clubs.  The car has an excellent suspension system which provides a comfortable ride.  The insurance is relatively low because it is a
very safe car should it be involved in an automobile accident.

Weaknesses:

For some reason, this car seems more difficult to parallel park even though it seems to have a sufficient turning radius.  The car has been problem-free except for the air conditioning condenser which was struck
by a stone, thus we had to replace the condenser.  Otherwise, we have
performed only routine maintenance.

The car exterior when polished up still looks like new.  Overall, we are
extremely pleased with the performance the car has given us.
