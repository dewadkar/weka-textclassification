            When my former car came to the end of it's running life I decided to start looking for a new car with some pep in it.  The search began with Hondas, Toyotas and Subarus.  My attention slowly turned to Volkswagens, and I began to look at the Golf and the New Beetle.  I test drove both, and when I drove off the lot in January I was behind the wheel of a 2001 New Beetle GLS; Green with black leatherette interior.  
I have been nothing but pleased with the pep in my car. The 2.0 liter engine is sufficent enough for my needs and can go up over 100 MPH.  My car's interior is roomy and spacious, but the backseat can only hold shorter people comfortably.  When moving from a large oldsmobile to a small Beetle I worried about the size of the trunk, but after going on a road trip with the Beetle I am no longer concerned.  The backseat folds down and leaves ample room for everything you would need to take with you.  
The gas milage is lower than a Civic, but it is just fine if you keep your speed around 70 on the highway.  I get on average about 28-30 MPG.  The car is also rated a ULEV or Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle.  With this the car can be driven in any state without worrying about it meeting e-check standards.  The saftey features abound inside and out, it is rated number one in it's class saftey wise and has two airbags for each of the front passengers.  
This car has been nothing but a joy to me, and I would not trade it for the world.  If you are considering it, you are lucky and if you do purchase it don't forget to call VWOA for your free New Beetle Birth Certificate!
