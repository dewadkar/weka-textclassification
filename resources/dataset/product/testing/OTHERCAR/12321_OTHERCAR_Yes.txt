            Despite what others may say, the newest addition to the Eclipse family is a brilliant one.  It's sporty, roomy, and comfortable.  With the new sportronic transmission, you can choose how you drive.  A much easier to drive version of an old classic.  Compared to older models, there is much more room.  For those of you who like loud music, it's easier to install a system in this car than in the past.  Good car for teenagers because there isn't as much power as can be found in other sports cars.<br><br>
