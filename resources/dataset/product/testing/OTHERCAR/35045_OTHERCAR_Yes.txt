            I must preface my description letting you know my bias- I am a perfectionist, enjoy English culture, use the truck for off-roading, and am a member of the Land Rover Society. Needless to say I love my Series II. 
 
I have noticed that most if not all the negative reviews on Land Rover come from reviewers who have little or no experience with the truck (non-owners, renters, browsers, etc).  Land Rover is an English vehicle, not an American vehicle.  Because it was adapted for American culture, there will always be inconsistencies with American taste.  If you like the smooth car-like performance of American SUV's, this is probably not the truck for you..

The current Land Rover line-up includes following: Freelander- economical car-like SUV, Defender (90 & 110)- the most capable off-road models and only available in Europe, Range Rover- a Bentley SUV, Discovery- a compromise between the smaller, more rugged Defender and the roomier, more luxurious Range Rover.  

GENERAL FEATURES/SUSPENSION
The Discovery II is a truck based on a truck frame deriving from the second generation Range Rover.  It has added most of the features of the first generation Range Rover (more so that the first generation discovery).  This truck frame differs from most other SUV's because it's suspension incorporates excellent 'live-axle' articulation.  Live-axle articulation is designed to be used for off-roading and gives each wheel more vertical travel than independent suspension set-ups.  The independent suspensions used on many other SUV's (including the new 2002 Range Rover) are meant for more on-road performance.  Note that the differential housing on each axle is aligned under the passenger side of the vehicle.  This moves the susceptible part of the axle out from under the center of the vehicle to give more useful clearance for off-roading.  It is on the passenger side because in England the driver sits on the passenger side.  This just one of the many off-road features unique to this truck (listing all the unique features would require a lot more space).  The downside to all of this translates to added weight (can be >5,000 lbs.  For on-road performance, I would recommend ACE (Active Cornering Enhancement).  The Land Rover Trek vehicles used to demonstrate Land Rover's "go anywhere" capabilities all come with ACE.  The ACE package reduces vehicle roll in turns (similar to a sway bar).  The Series II also has excellent visibility in bad weather and can be seen easily by other cars in bad weather due to rear fog lights.  Most Disco II's come with Goodyear tires (~$250 a piece).  Plan for the tires to only last 15-25k and the brakes to last for only 15-20k if used for city commuting.  The roof rack and extension rack can carry a lot of weight (I can carry 2 full-size canoes and 4 bikes easy).  

ENGINE
An older Buick block 8 cylinder engine is used to provide better low-end torque for off-roading and to power the heavy vehicle.  The engine uses BMW's 7 series engine management system to make it run smooth.  Many 'car experts' call the engine 'ancient'.  I have yet to see one break down on any disco I or II off-roading (that can't be easily fixed)- I would call it extremely reliable and practical although it has horrible gas mileage.  If at all possible get the TD300 or TD5 diesel (only available in Europe) as they are preferable for off-roading and bring the fuel efficiency to over 25 MPG.  The diesel engines are relied upon by the British military, NATO, and others.  Why doesn't the US get diesel?  Unfortunately Land Rover does not think the American market will want the noisier engine.  US gas is also cheap vs. UK gas (at ~$4/gallon) so the demand for greater efficiency isn't here either.  

INTERIOR
The interior is top notch (only complaint- GPS not an option).  It has abundant durable leather.  The wood (real wood- unlike it's American competitors) option on the dash makes it truly luxurious (if desired).  The gages are easy to read at night or day and the headroom in the front and rear is also very good.  The rear seats could use more legroom- but I fit fine in the front at 6'3.  The seats are very supportive and comfortable.  The visibility is very good- especially in bad weather- although the windshield design makes it hard to look up at stop lights.  Two electric sunroofs and rear air (even in the cargo space) make all passengers comfortable.  The engine bay is clean and has an internal snorkel designed to ford water up to the windshield as a stock vehicle (not recommended though).  The spare tire is a full size 5th tire, not a cheap spare.  

GENERAL PERFORMANCE
The on-road handling is decent although other SUV's (e.g. the 2002 explorer) seem quicker in acceleration and stopping mainly because they are lighter.  But pushed in a hard turn with ACE and the disco should outperform the others except for the AMG Mercedes and X5.  Off-road handling can't be compared with the other SUV's since they weren't designed for it.  The disco II has a "hill descent control" which allows the engine and ABS to work together to keep the truck safely descending forward or backward in places you wouldn't want to be without the feature.  The low gear and optional shifting allow all the control you need without burning up a clutch (US Land Rovers come only as automatics now).  If you plan to do a lot of off-roading don't buy the aluminum brush bar or light guards- take the front bumper and side guards off immediately and replace them with steel accessories from an aftermarket supplier (eg- ARB or Safari Guard)- this will greatly improve clearance/performance.  

A new disco II can be had at $35,000 nicely equipped, but to make one lavish, plan to spend more than $45,000.00.  

The 2003 discovery is virtually identical to the 1999-2002 disco except for the following: rear tail-light assembly, front headlamps (Xenon), 4.6L gas guzzler engine (not needed), GPS option, improved ACE package, improved brake system (more responsive), and a center differential lock.  

The discovery is due for a major facelift in 2005 and will likely merge with the Lincoln Navigator and incorporate an independent suspension in the rear of the truck.  I only hope that under Ford's new leadership Land Rover will retain its off-road niche..  If not, Land Rover will lose a lot of loyal customers.  

If you want a great off-road vehicle second only to the Defender for overall off-road ability, buy a 2000 discovery II as it can incorporate most if not all the newer features on the 2003 model, for less money.
