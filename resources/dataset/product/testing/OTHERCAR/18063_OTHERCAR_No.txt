               I bought a 1996 Dodge Neon in February of 1999.  I liked the way the car looks, and I enjoyed driving it.  The car I got has a sunroof, which I thought was a nice extra.  I had the car for two weeks when I started having trouble with the transmission.  When the car was shifted into gear, it would not move.  Suddenly there would be a loud &quot;clunk&quot; and then it would move.  I took the car to the Dodge dealer where I bought it.  They took the transmission apart and found that rubber O-rings inside the transmission were leaking.  It was over $900 in repairs  (Good thing I had a warranty).  The mechanic told me that it is a common problem in Neons.  Apparently the transmission is not heavy-duty enough for the car.  The same transmission is used in larger cars, such as the Intrepid, and they have even more problems.  I see that in the Dodge advertisements, they are advertising the new Neons with  improved transmissions.  <br><br>
