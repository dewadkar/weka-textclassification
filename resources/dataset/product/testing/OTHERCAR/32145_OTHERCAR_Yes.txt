            The Daewoo Lanos offers a lot of feature for the money. More &quot;luxury&quot; items came standard on the '99 models than on other cars I test drove in higher price brackets. It is available as a notch-back or a sedan. 

What I love:
1. It has a sporty look (the notch-back especially)
2. It handles well with very responsive steering, for the price range
3. It has a lot of neat options such a sun/moon roof. This roof will flip up or slide back and it is fairly quiet when closed even at top speed.
4. It comes with a 36,000 mile warrenty and it can be extended to 100,000 for a reasonable additional fee. 
5. Roadside assistance is included for 36,000 miles. I left the lights on and ran the battery down while at a friends house over night. Daewoo was there in a reasonable amount of time and jump-started the car at no cost to me. 

What I hate:
1. No dial to indicate when to change gears (and it isn't an option). If you drive a manal like I do, even if you don't need an indicator it's nice to have. Plus it feels weird to drive a stick with out one, even though it isn't necessary.
2. The gear ratio seemed strange to me and still does. I don't know if this is because I depend on the that RPM dial (I forget what it is called) more than I realize but it certainly is different than the Honda Civic, Hondae Elondra, or Ford Focus I drove. They all seemed to go from 1st to 2nd at about the same speed but the Lanos seems different. I got use to it and it isn't a problem but everyon who drives it says the same thing.
3. I go to school in Chattanooga TN which has a lot of hills. Sometimes it really strains going up hill on the highway. To maintain a reasonable speed I will have to floor it (and I test drove the automatic and it seemed to struggle up hill even more than the stick). Even floored I loose speed. Other cars I tried slowed some on the same hill but not as dramticly. The Daewoo Nubira, the next model up (also several thousand more) did much much better, not needing to be floored and still not dropping much speed.
4. Some of the parts look cheap. The lights are supose to look like projection lamps and they aren't. The trim in back looks like black plastic. The wheels are really small for the wheel wells.
5. Parts are almost never in stock. If you need to order new floor mats or have something fixed expect to wait a while because you will (though this is more a reflection on the dealer you still have to take the car there or pay for it yourself).
6. The one of the lights on the AC and one of the power windows stopped working unexplainably. It was fixed and since it took a while I got a rental car free.  
The Lanos drive well overall (other than up steep hills) and is pretty peppy on the flat. It handles as well as any car I tried within several thousand in price, and is easy to park. For city driving I think it is a terrific car. It gets very good gas milage in the city -- better than listed I've found. 

I think the Lanos is the perfect car for;
1. A student or person with a limited budget 
2. A person who lives and works in a city and won't be driving up hill a lot.
3. A person who is getting their first car
4. A person who is looking for safe, reliable, and maybe a little sporty, since it does have nice lines.

I think the Lanos should be avoided by people who;
1. Live on a hill or in the mountains(like many do in TN. and GA.)
2. Have reason to drive uphill a lot
3. Need to merge a lot into fast moving traffic
4. Want to drive a stick but aren't really comfortable with it since there is no tachometor and I think it shifts a bit strange.
5. Plan to &quot;sup up&quot; their car. You can do a lot with a Civic that some of my friend thought they could do with my Lanos because the Lanos notch-back looks a little like the Civic notch-back but you can't (I don't care at all) and it would void the warranty and the warranty is a major plus. 
Overall, I'd give it a &quot;3&quot;; it's a good car at a great price with some very nice features. It is safe and dependable, I feel. <br><br>
