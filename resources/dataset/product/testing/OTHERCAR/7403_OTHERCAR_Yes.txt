              I have my WRX for about 5 months now.This car is a rocket. With almost 150 wheel horse power,and AWD,people are wondering how a Subaru can go so fast. Inside the WRX,the interior is nicely designed;In-dash 6 CDs audio system comes with the car.Momo steering wheel,racing style bucket seat(don't get the wrong idea,I am 6'1 and 240lb,I am comfortably fitted in those racing seats) and pedal set are also nice features.Here are some few down side of the car from my point of view.My WRX is noisy when driving, the engine and muffler get really hot( don't put milk in the trunk after grocery shopping ).Turbo maintenance is pricy,my dealer recommended Mobil 1 oil change.For people who like modifications, this is the car for you, I spent around $1000 and I can almost break the 5 seconds barrier from 0-60 and 13 seconds in 1/4. Watch out Corvette, you can't dust me that easily.(it still can, for now)
