            With my best friend living on the other side of the country, I got a little tired of constantly describing things I had purchased or what size the herbs I was growing had gotten.  I decided that I would invest in a digital camera and send her pictures instead.  Believe me, I wasn't that great at describing things, and often left my best friend saying, &quot;Uh, I guess I can picture it....&quot;  Now, I just take a pic, download it onto my computer and send it to her in a matter of minutes!

I researched and came across the Olympus D-360L.  I was attracted to the relatively low price ($299) and the high amount of megapixel for the price (1.3).  I also liked that it could be used on both an IBM and Mac. Having an LCD screen was very important to me too. 

The camera is very sleek looking and is easy to carry.  There is an optional carrying case that you can purchase.  The LCD viewing window allows you to see the shot immediately, so you can delete the ones you don't like.  That way, every shot you keep is a good one!  It's also fun to take silly pics without worrying that you'll be wasting space.  

The camera has a menu of functions, such as the quality of shot you want, date/time print, cropping a shot, shutter speed, etc.  You can also adjust the flash for an indoor shot, overcast day or an outdoor shot.  It also has a sequence function, where it will take several shots right in a row.  It has a timer also.  

The quality of the pictures are excellent.  Several people have commented on how much detail the pictures have and how crisp they are.  The camera comes with a program that allows you to edit the picture on your computer.  

The camera can take lots of shots, more if you use a lower quality of shot.  I've never had a problem with it running out of space.  If you are on a long trip, however, you might want to download onto a computer more often.

I've used the camera both indoors and outdoors and I've never been disappointed in the camera's performance (I have been disappointed in how I look in the pic, but that's not the poor camera's fault..lol).

One of the problems I have with the camera is the menu is a bit confusing without the manual.  Also, it uses up batteries pretty quickly (4 AAA).  I purchased rechargeable batteries, which have solved the problem and have saved a lot of money.

I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for a moderately priced digital camera that offers a lot of features.  The camera is sleek and light and take wonderful pictures.  

Your friends and family will love getting such wonderful pictures from you!!!<br><br>
