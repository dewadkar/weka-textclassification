            This is a great consumer camera! As a prior owner of a Fuji DS-7, I was looking to upgrade to megapixel quality without significantly downgrading my checking account. The MX-500 fits this bill as it is, basically, a MX-700 repackaged without the metal body or the rechargable Lithium ion battery. The camera came with 4 AA Alkaline batteries and a 4 meg Smartmedia card. I immediately went out and bought a Sanyo 1 hour Dome charger and 2 sets of high capacity Sanyo NiCads. This is a must for any digital camera owner as the charger is portable and allows you to prevent camera down time while shooting by charging one set while using the second. I also bought a new 16 meg card and relegated the included card to backup status. Now a Case Logic DC-50 case to carry all this and I'm off and shooting! As I expected from Fuji, the camera's controls are very easy to operate. I have found that I can normally just set the controls to AUTO mode and get great pictures no matter who I have using the camera. The SETUP menu allows you to choose between 4 FLASH modes (auto, red-eye reduction, forced & off), 3 QUALITY (compression) modes (fine, normal & basic), 2 SIZE (640X480 or 1280X1024), and 3 SHARPNESS settings. It takes a short time to setup the camera, so make sure you are thinking ahead about the pictures you plan on shooting. If you need to take a special effect shot, you simply go to the MANUAL mode where you can set WHITE BALANCE (5 settings), EXPOSURE VALUE(9 settings), FLASH POWER (5 settings), or FLASH SYNC (on/off). Although a bit slow to react, the camera's controls are very intuitive and laid out in a common sense arrangement. The addition of a lens cover was a nice touch by Fuji.There are two things that amazed me about this camera: 1.-The battery management is fantastic! I average over an hour of shooting when using the LED display and over 2 hours if I keep the LED off. You can even perform a download to your computer via serial port without a battery change. This is a tremendous improvement over most of the battery hogs out there on the market. 2.-The picture quality in FINE mode is superb! The colors and contrast are true and rarely require software manipulation. I have been able to print pictures up to 8" X 10" with no detectable loss in quality! This comes in very handy when sending pictures to my grandfather who is visually impaired.At less than $400, the MX-500 produces high quality snapshots for average consumer use while offering professional features normally seen in cameras costing nearly twice the price. I would recommend the MX-500 to anyone who wants a good family camera that will allow them to dabble in amateur photography
