            We put off making a jump from a station wagon to a van for several years and the wait has paid off.  We fell in love with the Oldsmobile Silhouette Premiere version immediately.  It didn't hurt that we were picking up a 1999 with 10K miles at a great price!

After looking at several vans what stands out as great features in the Oldsmobile Silhouette are a V6 (we like to travel and didn't want to crawl up the hills!), 5 doors (didn't want the kids crawling over one another), the side door that can be electronically controlled from inside or out (great when your hands are full or the children are young and they can't open such a large door themselves), the extended length so that the third seats have real leg room (it is very spacious -- my children are always commenting on how much room there is!), removable third seats (one or both), the many safety and theft protection features, and the amenities such as leather seats, lighting throughout, hvac controls in the front and back and the extensive entertainment system including CD and VCR with drop down screen (critical to us for the long road trips -- a bit of overkill for around town!).

If you want a vehicle that is very practical, yet luxurious, the Oldsmobile Silhouette may be the answer.<br><br>
