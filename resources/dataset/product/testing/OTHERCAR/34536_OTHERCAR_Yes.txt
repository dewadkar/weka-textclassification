            I purchased the Hewlett Packard digital camera in order to share my childrens daily lives with family and friends in other states.  I first started using it when my youngest was born. This is great to send pics to your family... call your mom... tell her the kids got into the chocolate chips... she says... take a picture... you did... and hey mom... check your email, because it is allready there!!
It is simple to use... just take the pictures, plug the camera into your computer, and download right there. It allows you to take several pictures of the same scene and choose which one you would like to use before developing!
