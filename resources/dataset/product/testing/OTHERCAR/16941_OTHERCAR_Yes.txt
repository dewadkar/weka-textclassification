            If you love the outdoors and need a car to handle all your gear, then this car is for you.  This wagon is the perfect SUV-alternative.  It handles like a sporty sedan, has great power (2.5L, 4 cylinder engine), and has the essential winter-necessity--&gt; AWD traction.  All while getting pretty good gas mileage (26 highway, 21 city).  

Plus, many Subaru wagon owners I spoke with said this car has an AWESOME service record.  There were several folks who said the car didn't need anything for the first 80,000 miles or so.

The 2000 model has some nice new additions: different colors--you can now get maroon, for example.  Plus a beautiful, redesigned wooden interior. The cup holder is quite clever too. Power seats too.

What I don't like about this vehicle?
I'd love it more if it had a 6 cylinder engine (I want even more power).  Apparently though, Subaru is planning to offer a 6 cylinder version in a few years.  

The seats are kind of stiff, but not too uncomfortable. 
It looks too sporty---within one week of owning it, I got a speeding ticket.  I think the cop must have been aiming for the car.  :) 

While I can't complain a lot about the price, it is still quite north of $20,000.  So for a first time car owner, it's quite a lot of  $$$.  But when you compare it to a Ford Explorer or Jeep Cherokee, I think you get a lot more for a lower price.
