            It was time for a commuter car. I wanted something nice that was new and that would still have a warranty after I had finished paying for it. I do a 48 mile each way commute every weekday, so the only choice that had the warranty I wanted was the Hyundai Accent. I did my research, and went down and purchased a base model. A &quot;beater upper&quot; that would handle my commute and whatever else I threw at it. 1 year later I'm pleased with my purchase.

I have almost 20,000 miles on the car, and have only had one problem -- the windshield wipers. Living in the northeast when I get a bit of snow I like to turn my windshield wipers on, but unfrotunatly the heavy thick snow we got and the ice encrusted wipers sometimes, caused the wiper motor to go out. I took it back to my dealer and got it fixed, and am happy ( of course winter is coming again ) but you do get what you pay for, and that being the only problem I've had, I'm happy with the car as a whole.

The gas mileage I think is like 34 or 35 that I get. Would be nice to get more, but it does better than our minivan, so it saves money there. The ride isn't luxury, but it suits....and yes somedays I'll through my family of four into the little hatchback and we'll take a country drive. Especially with gas prices the way they currently are!

All in all I recommend this little beauty. Not for a family car, but for a commuter car, and for the first time car owner. I'm glad I got it.....and when the warranty runs out I'll go get another.<br><br>
