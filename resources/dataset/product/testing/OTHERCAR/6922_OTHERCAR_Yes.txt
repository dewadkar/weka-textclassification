            So honda is the one to make the first giant leap in gas mileage.  infact quite a gap.  70mpg highway and 61mpg city.  Thats pretty impressive for a car that can potentially seat 5.  Its ugly futuristic design was necassary for aerodynamics to get the best gas mileage possible.  Which I feel confident in saying.  They succeeded at.  However.  The aerodynamic body could not have been put on to a more horrible design idea.  It looks almost (I may be crazy here) but it looks to me like its a CRX with puffed out and wheel covering quarter panels.  A CRX on drugs if you will.  And I personally hate the CRX's body style with a passion.  It shows no creativity what so ever.  It looks like they gave up on designing the back end, so they just chopped it off or something.. I dont know.  Anyone it still is an amazing gas mileage car.  And with gas prices rising frighteningly quickly this may be the future of all cars to come.<br><br>
