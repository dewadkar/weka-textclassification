                 This past August, I decided it was time to purchase my own first car.  I went out, not knowing anything, and came home with a 1999 Toyota Corolla CE.  My parents were split on what I should purchase.  My mom swore by Toyota, where as my dad was a Ford man.  

     I reviewed all the available options, packages, colors and safety features and decided that the Corolla was the best value all around.  Sure, the Chevy Cavalier, or Ford Escort may have a cheaper invoice price, but I figured that what I saved on the purchase price I would more than make up for with service and repair bills.  

     So rather than saving a few bucks up front, and being stuck with heaps of bills later on, I decided that the extra money was well worth it for me in the long run.  I have had my car for over six months now and I am still sticking by my decision.  

     I nanny part time and I feel better knowing that the kids are safe while in my car.  Actually I feel better knowing that I am safe while in my car.  The Corolla may not be the cutest, or the fastest, but it is the safest.  I've learned that the cutest or the fastest car does you absolutely no good when you miss a stop sign, or that other guy doesn't notice the red light.  

     Take a test drive.  I promise you that you'll feel the same as I do.  <br><br>
