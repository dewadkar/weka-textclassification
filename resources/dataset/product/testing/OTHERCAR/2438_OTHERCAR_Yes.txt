            Note: The Picture posted above is of the Rodeo Sport, not the actual Rodeo.

I received my 2001 <b>Isuzu Rodeo</b> as a generous 2000 Christmas present from my parents. I&#146m the type of person that trades my car in after only about two years. But this time I was told that this was the last car that they were buying for me. That was fine with me! I had finally gotten the car that I had wanted since I was sixteen...no arguments were coming out of my mouth! And I suspect that my parents leased me this car, with the thought in mind that I couldn&#146t get out of it for three years. If you knew them, you would know that they are a sneaky pair!

SUV makers seem to have come to some conclusions lately. Everyone seems to be competing for something. Recently we had the Santa Fe come to life and then the new Jeep Liberty. It seems as though vehicle makers have come to realize that SUV&#146s are becoming more popular. I cannot state as to how true this is because there are still people that either cannot afford one, or simply do not want a vehicle that big. I can say that I find that I completely enjoy my vehicle. The size is perfect for me and don&#146t think I would ever get back into a car again. If not for the fact that I like all the extra room, but that I just <I>feel</I> safer in my SUV.

<b>MY SUV</b>
My particular Rodeo was the S model, 2-wheel drive. At the time that this <b>Rodeo</b> was purchased for me, I was driving around in a 2-year old truck. So as it was, I was upside down in my payments and they would have to be added onto the new vehicle&#146s purchased price. Not wanting to be paying 400 a month for a vehicle for me, on top of their vehicles, my parents decided on the S model. I think they had an ulterior motive in buying the smaller 2.2L engine also! But they deny it! I don&#146t really drive that fast&#133well, most of the time anyway. For those of you that are scoffing at my 4-cylinder vehicle, that&#146s just too bad. I love this vehicle and find the 4-cylinder to be perfect to control my heavy foot. In spite of what you think about 4-cylinder vehicles, this <b>Rodeo</b> does actually have a lot of power to it. It has more than what I expected it to anyway.  My <b>Rodeo</b> cam equipped with what <b>Isuzu</b> calls a &#147power&#148 button. This button can be used if more powerful acceleration is needed. It is easy to use, simply put the vehicle in drive and push the &#147power&#148 button. There will also be a &#147power drive&#148 indicator light that comes on when this driving pattern is selected. 

 My 2001 <b>Rodeo</b> did not have all that many improved features from the year 2000 model. The only thing <B>Isuzu</b> improved that year was the special edition packaging they were offering for the <b>Rodeo</b> anniversary.

<b>MY THOUGHTS</b>
I was absolutely delighted when they took me to the dealer to pick up my new <b>Rodeo</b>. My parents know me so well that they even knew to buy me the Ebony Black <b>Rodeo</b> with gray interior. But that could also come from the fact that I love the color black and both of my previous vehicles were black. 

I received a 10-year/120,000 mile Limited Powertrain warranty with this vehicle. I think that&#146s pretty good, even though I will not have this vehicle for that long of a time as my lease is only for 3 years. The fuel estimate is about 17 miles per gallon for city driving and 22 miles per gallon for highway driving. I think this is pretty good for an SUV. I used to commute across town everyday and noticed that it did take a lot of fuel to keep me going. But, now I do not have so long of a drive and probably only fill up about once a week. I seem to get better use of my gas if I am not driving long distances. 

I also received free 24-hour roadside assistance with Isuzu. All I have to do is call the 1-800 number provided for me to request assistance. I have never had a problem with the SUV; so have never had to use the assistance number. I also received a warranty on my Yokohama tires. 

The outside of my <b>Rodeo</b> is very sporty looking and has an overall great exterior look. I like the fact that it can look sporty and be very roomy, without the boxy looking effect that some other SUV&#146s have. The cargo area in the back is medium size, which is good for as I am not married and have no kids but do like to travel. I do not travel a lot with this vehicle, as it is a lease. But when I do, I like to be comfortable and have space for all of my stuff. Although minor, I also like the 60/40-split seat in the back. I can fold down the 60 portion and leave the 40 portion as an extra seat. This allows me to load up my bike into the back and still have room for a person to sit in the backseat. As I often have to do because I tend to accidentally leave my outside bike carrier at my parents&#146 home whenever I visit. 

So how does it ride? Seems just fine to me. I have never had a problem with the suspension on-road. No skittish-ness or slipping occurred, even in the torrential downpours we have had recently in Florida. And, I do have the &#147winter&#148 driving option. Under testy weather conditions, all I need to do is push the &#147winter&#148 driving button to activate the winter driving mode, which will improve driving operations. There is also a &#147winter drive&#148 indicator light that will appear when this option is in use. I have no experience driving this vehicle off-road and cannot tell you how it handles. I have driven over some dirt roads and have noticed that there is a slight bounce, but nothing overly noticeable. One thing that I have heard about this vehicle is that it is not so steady when rounding curves. But this is not a claim that I myself can back-up. I have made turned many corners and made many u-turns, but have not noticed any unsteadiness in the vehicle. 

Getting in and out of the <b>Rodeo</b> is no problem for me. I find that at 5&#1468&#148, even I have to hitch up a little to get into my aunt&#146s Ford Explorer and I do not like this. It makes me feel small. Not a problem with my <b>Rodeo</b> though. I feel that it is the exact size vehicle for my height. Getting in and out of the back seat is also not a chore, as there is a lot of room provided for passengers. As for the layout of the vehicle, I find that it is perfect for me. I am able to reach the dashboard and fiddle with the radio or input a CD without having to kiss the steering wheel. I am also very comfortable while sitting in my drivers&#146 seat for long distances. I did have a problem with this when I had my previous vehicle because I have long legs. While this might be a good thing when I am on a stage dancing my heart out, it&#146s not good for having to shove my legs under the steering wheel comfortably. I have plenty of room to adjust my front seat and still give the passenger behind me room for their own legs. And I have no problem reaching the steering wheel with my seat adjusted back a little to accommodate my legs. 

The only problem that I had with this vehicle is that it didn&#146t come with a sunroof, which is what I wanted. But hey, when you get a vehicle for free...you don&#146t utter a complaint! But I&#146ll be sure to get one on my next Rodeo when I turn this one in after the lease is up!
