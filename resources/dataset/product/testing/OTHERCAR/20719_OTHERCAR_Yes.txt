            Long before SUVs became such a hot commodity, I wanted one.  To tell you how long I'd dreamed about owning one, the sticker price on the first 4-door 4x4 Blazer I ever saw was $19,000, and I thought that was really expensive!  I can also remember when a new 4-door, 4x4 Explorer cost $20,000!

Little did I know that approximately seven years later, I'd shell out $26,000 for a '98 LS model one similarly equipped!  The actual sticker price was $29,000 - I got my vehicle at invoice (dealer made money on the factory holdback, which was about $750 to $800). 

Actually, a 2-door model would have been at least $5,000 cheaper (a local dealer routinely offers "teaser" 2-door models in the low $20k-range), but I wanted the added convenience and functionality of 4-doors.  My father had owned a couple of 2-door Blazers, and trying to access the backseat can be a chore in those models (as with most any 2-door vehicle).  Even if you don't plan to have back-seat passengers, keep in mind that the Blazer has fold-down seats that provide more cargo room if needed.  Having a four-door model allows better access to those levers.

Also, I wanted the longer wheelbase that a 4-door model brings.  You see, the reason my dad has owned a couple of Blazers is because I totaled one of his in the late 1980s.  To be specific, it was a rollover accident resulting from losing control on ice.  I'm here to say that 4-wheel drive can't perform miracles on ice! Four-wheel drive can be a "must" if you live in snow-prone areas, though. 

After the accident, I was somewhat afraid of SUVs.  Then, when 4-doors became popular a few years later, I surmised that the longer wheelbases would provide some rollover resistance.  

An LS model and 4-doors cost me a few thousand more, but that's what I ended up getting.  There is an LT model that has a few upgrades such as leather seating and different wheels (and a painted front grille versus the chrome-appearance grill of the LS), but I couldn't justify another nearly $2,500 price difference.  I didn't want leather seats that badly, plus I actually liked the grille and the wheels of the LS better.

My Blazer has a Touring Suspension, which is supposed to provide a smooth ride on trips.  The suspension was teamed up with 16-inch Michelin tires, and I have found that this Blazer rides smoother than its predecessors. 

<b>Specific Problems Said to Be Common for '98s</b> 
Older Blazers seemed notorious for tranny problems.  I haven't had any thus far (knock on wood).  However, I must tell you that my Blazer got to know Mr. Goodwrench quite well during the first few thousand miles.  I won't bore you with all the trips and the problems, but I was fortunate enough to have one of the best GM mechanics in my area take an interest in making sure the vehicle was fixed.  Had it not been for that service dept., I would have been very disheartened and upset. Fortunately, all the problems were covered while under warranty (and I still have time left on the tranny warranty). 

Between 600 and 5,000 miles, there was a recurring problem that would cause the Service Engine Soon light to flash on, the speedometer would suddenly fall to zero, and the vehicle's automatic transmission to suddenly shift down to second or even first gear. One time I had to drive 30 miles home on the highway like this - on a Sunday, no less! The last time the service department had the vehicle for this problem, I told them to keep it however long it took to find out what was going on.  They'd already replaced the computer, speedometer and other parts, and had been stumped as to why it continued to happen.  The mechanic took the time to start tracing wires and found that the speedometer wire had a super-tiny nick in it.  That wire was occasionally hitting a metal surface and "shorting out" when it did.  That was telling the computer that the vehicle was not moving (zero MPH).  The computer was responding by making the transmission gear down.  Man, aren't today's vehicles complicated! And, the service manager said that they expected to see more have this problem because the '98 model's wire bundles are not wrapped in protective insulation as past Blazer's had been(thanks to the mechanic, my Blazer's wires are wrapped now - smile).

Some other problems were easier to figure out.  The pushbutton 4x4 system had a button that was a little too sensitive.  You could lightly brush against the 4LO button and the vehicle would be in 4-wheel drive, low.  My service dept. knew exactly what that was.  I found out that if a problem is recurring, "bulletins" go out to all the dealerships.  This problem had been targeted as an oversensitive button, and GM had already developed a replacement.

Now, for the interior.  My one big gripe is that a few of the plastic components are, well, cheesy.  In particular, the driver's side seat latch has broken apart on me twice (both times under warranty).  The dealership told me that they had replaced "hundreds" of those things.  HELLO, Chevrolet!  Come up with a better latch!  I'm always treating that latch super-tenderly so it doesn't break off again!  

I must say that the exterior styling is what I like most about this vehicle.  Now I admit that in the past couple of years I've been looking at Toyota 4-Runners.  The 4-Runner resale value is much, much better than for a Blazer (all things equal).  However, one of my friends bought a 2000 4-Runner SR5 and when we parked side-by-side, I silently noted that the Blazer just has more unique styling lines. When you stand at the front or rear of my friend's 4-Runner and look at the side of the vehicle, it's rather plain.  Flat lines, no "curves".  The Blazer has defined lines along the lower panel and the wheel openings.

I have had no problems with the paint or the trim, either.  The seating is sufficient for me, and I've taken one 500-mile trip in it and it rode smoothly.  I'm just now rolling over on 40,000 miles and I plan to keep this shiny Blazer for a while!  

<b>Ride, Handling, Gas Mileage, ABS, etc.</b>
No SUV is a sports car, but my Blazer handles well (it won't turn as sharp a radius as 2-doors I've driven, but it's still OK). As for the overall ride, I've been in Explorers and 4-Runners, and I actually think the Blazer offers a less stiff ride.  

The gas mileage is better, too.  Around-town, I get 18 to 19 mpg.  Highway, I get low 20s.  Note that certain axle ratios (required for limited-slip differential option) are said to get approx. 2 mpg lower. The Vortec V-6 is an engine with good pick-up.  No troubles driving up mountainous highways. It's obviously not a large V-8, but it's most sufficient for most acceleration needs.  The ABS brakes (standard on Blazer and many other GM vehicles) allow you to stop quickly.  I will never own a vehicle without ABS.    

Now if you'd asked me what I thought at 4,000 miles when I viewed it as the most undependable thing I'd ever seen (before Mr. Goodwrench made my warranty truly count)....:) The Blazer has proved to be a handsome, reliable vehicle for me.  The insurance premiums were a little high at first but now insurance is most reasonable.

<b>Final Analysis</b>
The reason I can recommend this vehicle is because most of the "bugs" have probably been worked out while under warranty. The Blazer simply represents a value as a used SUV.  A 1998 4-Runner SR5 would be several thousand more than a 1998 Blazer LS or LT. A Blazer usually runs about $1,000 less than a similar Explorer, same model year. I have also been noting that you can visit a message board for any of these models and see that there is no completely trouble-free vehicle, period.
