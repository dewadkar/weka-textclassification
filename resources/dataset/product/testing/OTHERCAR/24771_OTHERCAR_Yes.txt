            This is a replacement for the Olympus 520D, a 2.0 megapixel camera. After exhaustive research, i bought this camera. first, you can't go wrong with any olympus camera. It depends on how much money you want to spend, understanding all but the top of the line models will have shutter lag, meaning you won't be able to do rapid fire shots.
I can live with this, although not being able to get my rabbit doing flips in midair, like i can with my minolta 38mm camera, is something that's a little hard to live with.

Foregoing this, and the rather steep price, i strongly suggest to everyone that if you buy this camera in a retail store, to comparitive shop. I got 100.00 back on this camera using the retailer's 110% price guarantee, something not enough people take advantage of. That being said, this camera cost me 300.00 not including the 256MB xD memory card, and other gadgets and extended warranty.
A weatherproof and all weather camera, this camera did wonderful in low light, nighttime shots, with the AF option activated, a simple point and shoot option many first time users do.
Not only did it compensate for the low light environment, it also beautifully adjusted the white space in back of my subject,creating a vibrant picture that needed almost no touchup on the computer.
There are red eye reduction, night time enhancement feature, and other features for you to adjust per the situation.
Olympus gives you a well written manual.
There are enough features on this camera to enhance your shot without getting lost in all the technology. 
You can create up to 5x7 prints from your shots, better than 4x6 photos like previous and lesser priced models.

The camera feels and acts like a well-built camera, and supposidly, it will withstand a drop or tow, but like anything else, it is breakable, so don't try to drop it, of course.
The camera although small, is not cumbersome nor clumsy, although handling the teeny cards are. The xD cards require careful attention or they are easily dropped/lost.
The Lithium ion battery is wonderful, you don't have to worry about running out of juice for several hours, and it only takes 20 min to recharge once it is charged the first time. The charger and one battery are included.
 The zoom feature, a 4x optical zoom is more than sufficient. The button is located on the back on this model, rather than the top, and with two hands on the camera, is easily accessible.
The small 16MB xD card, teeny yet effective remote, video cable, battery charger, Li-Ion battery and wrist strap all come with the camera. all the basics are in the box. 
As with any other camera, you need to buy a better memory card, reasonably priced, card reader and camera bag.
That's to be expected. I think Olympus did a great job providing all the essentials you would need to start using the camera right away in the box.
Overall, in both night and day, i am more than impressed with the quality of the shots, and will happily recommend this camera to all who are considering it.
Compared to the canon A70; it took sharper pictures and was just as easy to set up and use, and by far it took better picures than the Sony DSC7 and i would imagine it would blow away any of the other competitor's in this price range.
It's a little steep in price, but epinion helps you find the best price around. For me, i took a competitor's pricing in to a retail store for both the camera and 256MB memory card, and got back 110% on both, and got back 120.00..This helps make the camera affordable. Overall, including the card reader [24.00], 256MB mem card [110.00]
and extended warranty, i spent 581.00..Steep, but it could have been worse. The only thing that hurts is when i want to take rapid fire sequential pic of my rabbits doing binkies and other things, i have to use my 38mm camera..But for everything else, its nothing but digital, and you can't tell what was taken with which camera, so the prrof is in the pudding as to the quality of the Stylus 300.
