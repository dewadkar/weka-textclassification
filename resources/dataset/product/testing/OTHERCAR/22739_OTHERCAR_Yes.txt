            This is the longest length of time I have owned an automobile.  I bought it when I was a single mom of two kids. At the time they were in high school and college.  I made MANY trips to the college campus 120 miles away.  I felt confident when I travelled &amp;/or let my kids borrow my car.
I feel the amount and frequency of repairs have been about average. But, this is my first experience owning a car past 158,000 miles!  It has served well as a 'sporty', 4 door, 'family' car. White outside, cool inside, (red interior), and the AC is EXCELLENT here in the hot Texas summers.  A car I have been proud to own, and I feel you would too!
There have been many trips with my two kids, my elderly mom, and me!
One of the winning factors in my family, is MY MOTHER APPROVES ! She even discussed purchasing a Grand Am for herself!.......basically, I love it !
P.S. I got married in 1998, and my husband even likes the car! He says it is a 'keeper'! Just like me!...(Newlyweds!) <br><br>
