            When most people think of a sport utility vehicle, they think of a huge, uncomfortable truck, that doesn't ride smoothly at all. The GMC Suburban is a sport utility vehicle that rides smoothly, has a huge interior, and is great for a family. This car seats eight people, which is very convenient, when you have a large family, or are taking another family somewhere. I have a family of four, and it used to be impossible to take another family out to dinner, with using only one car. Now it is perfectly easy to do that. I love this car. It handles well, and I never have to take it for repairs. I love the enormous trunk, which can hold tons of suitcases, furniture, and ever lumber. This car is great for anyone, so might I suggest checking it out.<br><br>
