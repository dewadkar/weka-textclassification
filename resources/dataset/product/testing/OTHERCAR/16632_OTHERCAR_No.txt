            <p>This is a cheap car and it shows.  The exterior design is blocky.  I don't consider it to be sporty in the slightest.  The interior feels empty, and definitely looks like it was made of bottom line plastics.  The head room is so-so, but I think that taller people would have problems.  My 3 year old son has difficulty getting out the back of the car.  The location of the cup holders were not well thought out.  When in use, the cup you place in the holder blocks access to the climate controls.&lt;/p&gt;
<p>When driving the car, one of the most noticeable problems is the noise.  The engine is loud, and wind noise is horrible.  I have to turn the radio all the way up in order to hear it when the car is in motion.  The acceleration is practically non-existent.  The engine has to rev up to around 6000+ RPM in order to make it up an on ramp at any decent speed.  Once it gets up to speed, the handling is pretty decent.  The turbo available on this goes by the name of Air Conditioner.  Turn it off, and you'll get a little better speed.  There is a road that I drive on that curves around quite a bit, that I try every car I've driven on.  The Accent handles it rather well, getting up to speeds of about 50 on the curves.  The best I've ever pulled was in a Mustang Cobra, and that was 65.&lt;/p&gt;
<p>The stereo system is nothing to write home about.  The base and treble controls are limiting, and the sound quality could be much better.  I haven't tried the tape deck yet, but I don't expect much out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
<p>The quality of the paint on the door handles is rather poor.  I noticed it was starting to peel off after a couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
<p>Basically, this car is a bottom line car, and not really worth the low sticker price.&lt;/p&gt;
