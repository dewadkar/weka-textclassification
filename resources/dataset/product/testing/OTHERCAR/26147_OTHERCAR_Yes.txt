            I bought my 1992 GMC Sierra almost a year ago.  One main factor that made me consider buying this vehicle was the room. I have an extended cab, and it has a full back seat. Not like those little seats other vehicles have but a full back seat! It is very roomy and smooth driving truck. I can use it for anything from hauling hay to shopping. This truck would be good for anyone. It is a tough truck that will last. Right now I have 135,000 miles on this truck.  These trucks have a good resale value also. The trucks are fairly priced when you factor in everything you get,  a sharp looking truck that is roomy and can handle almost anything.  <br><br>
