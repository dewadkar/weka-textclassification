            On a trip to California in a friends Saturn we were involved in an automobile Accident with a Semi-Truck.  Basically the semi side swiped us and sent our car into the wall where we hit then crossed all lanes on the freeway into the other wall.  The Safety features worked. NOBODY got hurt in this accident and the car, even though it was wrecked on all 4 sides still drove off the road.  I also owned a Saturn for 8 years and loved that car.  It got great gas mileage, had little if any problems and the ride was very smooth. For the price I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a first time vehicle or a family car. I have personally witnessed its capability to protect its occupants in the event of a crash. <br><br>
