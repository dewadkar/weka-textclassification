            In today's auto market, at least in the USA, what other car out there offers very good performance (acc/handling/braking), with so many amneties, spaciousness with 4 doors and a large trunk, offers a stick shift option, and costs well under $30k?  Uhm...

Well, the BMW 323i comes to mind.  Awesome car, handles and feels better than the new Maxima, but it's kinda tight, and let's face it, if you get it w/o options to stay below the $30k range, uhm, you're not being fair to yourself.  Same with the Audi 1.8T.  It's pretty tight inside, and will cost over $30k easy (although not by much).  And unless you get a $400 ECU upgrade, 150 horses just ain't gonna do you much.

Realistically, a '00 Maxima SE *fully* loaded with a 5-spd can be attained for under $28k.  That's a fact.  And yeah it's FWD and doesn't have traction control, something the Audi/BMW have over it, but the performance pedigree cannot be ignored.  Nor can the much larger interior room.

Exterior:  It's grown on me.  I didn't like it at first.  Definitely not.  But now I think even the back end looks decent.  Just make sure you get a color that doesn't show the black outline around the tailights, as that is, well, ugly.  You won't go wrong with any of the dark colors.  The 17 inch optional rims look real nice too, and the car comes with very good tires (Brid. Potenzas).

Interior:  More space in every dimension over the '99 model.  The new dash gauges, colors, and fonts are definitely cooler, in my view.  I really like the fonts used.  The slight redesign of the center console is better too.  BOSE system is the same (pretty darn good for a &lt; $30k car).  The leather is of good quality, and you get dual power seats (passenger only gets 4-way power though).  You got heated seats, in-dash CD, cruise, automatic climate control, nice storage bins and extending arm rest (cool feature, check it out), etc.  You can get all this.


Drive:  The chassis first.  Definite improvements here.  Feels a little tighter built, yet felt significantly more isolating from the outside world.  Chassis flex is certainly reduced, maybe just somewhat, but you can feel it.  It's quieter at high speeds, even with the sport suspension and tires.  Nissan engineers decided that with what they determined about their rear axle (not independent on each side, which is desirable for bump isolation and overall comfort and finesse) an independent rear setup was not needed.  They altered the mount points, a little more back, and it's hard to notice any improvement in high-limit handling, at least say, the balance when taking a turn, but definitely it's pretty close how it reacts to bumps as say, a hi-strung Honda or Toyota with IND. rear suspension.  Good job (IND. suspension by the way would have raised the Maxima's price by at least a couple grand).

Drivetrain:  The engineers didn't touch the engine, rather, to raise HP from 190 to 222 and peak torque from 207 to 214, they played with the exhaust system.  Higher-flowing, they even installed the muffler from the Skyline GT-R hi-perf. coupe (not offered in the USA) and what that does it offer 2 separate gas routing with differing length.  Effectively, at 2700RPM a butterfly valve changes position to allow a more appropriate/efficient route for the exhaust gas to produce better mid-hi rev range power.  This allows a better distribution of torque.

Also, they improved the shifter in terms of durability.  Not that Maximas of past were plagued with early-to-die trannies at any time, but nonetheless they strengthened it up and changed the synchronizers on 1st and 3rd gears for better feel.  I didn't feel any difference.  

Actually, the engine power, sound, shifter feel and speed all were virtually identical to me compared to the '97-'99 cars.  Makes sense.  The engine's the same.  The isolation of the chassis is a little different, and the car's overall weight is up a bit.  So no, the car isn't any faster than the '99.  Maybe in 5th gear WOT it will gain a little, but shouldn't by much due to the extra weight.  I don't have to mention how good the engine is, as you already know this V-6 is a gem.  Extremely smooth (although a tad less than the in-line 6 from BMW, and the Audi A4 V6 comes pretty close), extremely flexible, and actually gets good gas mileage.  One of the top 5 V6s of all time, for sure.  I just wish it sounded more aggressive under WOT.  Cuz as it is, it's REALLY quiet (I guess a good thing for thousands of Maxima buyers, but hey, we are buying a &quot;sports sedan&quot; with a 5-spd and 17 inch sport wheels and suspension!).

The car does a really good job of providing a luxurious ride and a very sporty demeanor (really, it's very good in the turns) for the price.  Don't get me wrong, it is quite obvious the &quot;higher&quot; or &quot;better&quot; or &quot;different&quot; level of luxury &quot;feel&quot; and sportiness your $40k get your for a 328i, for example, but for the money, this car cannot be touched.  At least not from any stock factory offerings.  

I personally don't like the Maxima shifters.  Never have.  It's too long-feeling, nice short, tight, and precise.  It's very easy and low-effort to row, as is the clutch, but it's not that easy to launch the car in 1st gear, and you feel a bit of vibration with the shifter in hand.  Certainly no competitor to BMW shifters, but hey, at least Nissan offers the option, and it's a reliable design to boot.

If you need REAL spaciousness (A4s just don't cut it, and the new 3-series really are still a little tight), a 5-spd, tons of amneties, a genuine trunk, and a real good perf./luxury combo, for a really competitive price, get this car.  Well, you first have to like the styling, which might be a problem (did you know?  The CA design studio is already on the works re-designing this car for 2002?).  And you really have to ask yourself &quot;do I really need this extra space over that really awesome 323i 5-spd I can get for just a couple grand more?&quot;  Well, the Maxima SE really comes with everything you'd want, and an equally equipped Bimmer will cost substantially more than a couple grand more.

Also, safety-wise...alright, listen up. I'm not gonna go into this, it'll make the review too long (I always do that don't I...) but the truth is, when you learn of all the safety engineering that went into them, the German competition is significantly better than any Japanese product.  The Maxima I'm sure meets all the gov't crash standards and has the airbags and adjustable seat belts, and has very good active safety because of the performance injection, but overall safety, along with refinement, is something a little lacking from the Maxima compared to an Audi or BMW of similar price.  You kinda are getting what you paid for remember?  And actually, in the Maxima's case a hell of a lot, especially with that great engine.

Speaking again of refinement, you can't touch upon the 323/8i for example, but it's darn good for mid-high $20s.  You will be impressed, even if you owned a previous Maxima ('96-'99).  But you won't be if you just stepped out of a new BMW or Audi.  Then remind yourself of the price difference, then you're back at ground zero, on and on and on... ;-)

Nissan says 40% or more of their Maximas are sold as SEs.  This is the &quot;sport&quot; version, which comes with the stiffer suspension.  However, you can still choose from an auto and a stick (previous experience with a '98 Maxima SE auto is that acceleration is greatly compromised over the 5-spd, but I guess most buyers will opt for the auto in the USA).  I am sure that their reincarnated bread-n-butter product will get em a lot of money, and rightfully so.  

I wanna give the car a 5/5, which it certainly deserves for its price range, let alone the great effort by the engineers (I am sure this Maxima will last many many years) but I will give it a 4 cuz of the styling, lack of traction control with a 5spd, and just some very specific nit-picking I have about the drivetrain (engine excepted).  Plus, hey, even though they are more expensive, but if I give the new 3-series 5/5, I can't really give this car the same, EVEN with the price advantage (I have many reasons for that).  But I certainly encourage a test drive.  If you don't like rowing your own gears, oh oh, we're in trouble now, cuz the competition is a lot better suddenly (check out Acura TL!).  But if you insist on a 5-spd, and you really can't do $30k+, DEFINITELY check it out!
