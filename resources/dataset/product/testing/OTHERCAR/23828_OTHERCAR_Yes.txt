            This car is cool and cute, but not too teenager-y. It is perfect for a college student or a recent graduate who doesn't want huge car payments and doesn't want to sign up for a 5-year auto loan. Hey, you're not getting a lot of back seat or trunk space. And the 4-cylinder engine doesn't have a lot of zip or power. But the car looks good, and the front seats are roomy. And the price is great. Even if you throw in A/C, cassette player and cruise control, you're talking around $11,000 at most dealerships. The 2-door and 4-door are $1,000 apart (no real reason to get the 4-door, it's not a whole lot roomier.) The interior design is pretty neat - the speedometer and warning lights are raised into a small round window in the center of the dashboard, and there's a dual glove box and 3 cup holders in the front seat. The exterior is pretty cool - there's no hatchback look. Basically, this is a Ford Escort with more style and a lower sticker - and Toyota has experience with the car, since it's very close to a redesigned Tercel. I've seen reports that say the car is a noisy ride, but I haven't had that experience at all. Check it out.
