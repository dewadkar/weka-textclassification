            My friend purchased his Kia a few months ago and can't stop boasting about it. I always thought Kia was a waste of time to consider. Many people gave them a bad rap and know nothing of them. They assumed the price dictated the quality. In this case, I must say it isn't so. 

I took a ride in my friends Kia Sportage and couldn't believe the quality for the price. Even the stock stereo sounded better than average. The interior was not all plastic and cheap looking. It had a more expensive look and feel to it. The paint is also a higher grade than used on an average vehicle. I was also impressed with the handling and performance. Now I've got the new car bug and feel like trading in the Plymouth Voyager that I praised so much in one of my other Epinions. It has been good to me, but it might be about time to retire her.
