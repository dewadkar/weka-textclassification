            I bought my Saturn in May of 96' and still love it.  My mother-in-law and sister-in-law also both had 96' Saturns.  The reasons I said had, was my mother-in-law was hit by someone running a stop sign at 35mph.  Except for a swollen knee, she walked away.  The safety features did exactly what they were supposed to.  The car was totaled, and she replaced it with a newer Saturn.  My sister-in-law still loves her car as much as I do.
The problems I have had with my car are fairly minor, except for my gas tank imploding.  Saturn sent a tow truck within a half-hour, and I had my car back in 36 hours.  (They said it was the first time they saw that happen)  My battery died, and once in a while my check engine light will come on for no reason.  Also the carpet was replaced free of charge because it wasn't cut right, and started pulling up (the same for my sister-in-law, but not mother-in-law).
The advantages of my car are when moving from New Jersey to Florida I got over 53 miles p/gallon (No Joke).  I was driving 50mph behind my husband, and stopped once for gas.  Saturn never said it could do that!  The truck holds all my groceries and then some.  The seats fold down 60/40, so I can have someone sit in the back and still fold down the seat.  The clip that holds the truck shuts removes, if something won't go in with it there.  The radio kicks out some pretty good sound.  The cloth seats clean fairly easy.  The car almost looks new after it's washed, the paint is holding up great.  The steering wheel is adjustable so my husband and I can both drive more comfortably.  I'm short and he's tall, it's a little cramped when he drives if he doesn't adjust it.  The doors still bounce back after almost five years, and people still kick them when I tell them about it.
