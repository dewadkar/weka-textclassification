            In the past, Sony Mavica's have been great starter digital camera's for people who didn't know much about either digi-cams or computers.  The market has progressed so that Megapixel has become a standard to meet.  As Sony compensates by bumping up capture resolution higher and higher, the pictures, undoubtedly get larger and larger.  One thing that can not, and never will be able to exceed any current limits is the 3.5 inch floppy disk.  The Appeal of the Mavica comes in that Floppy's are very easy to use, just take the picture, and it saves it to a floppy that can be read by the standard floppy drive.  Simple and efficient, yet i can not stress enough how much this will catch up with Sony and end up screwing them in the end.  Using floppys as media for digital photography is for beginners, no offense to anyone that does.  But Sony has &quot;High end&quot; Digi-cam's that can take 1+ megapixel pictures which leans more towards advanced users.  Something seems wrong here, to me, its like having a limosuine take you to Publix.  Floppy was great for beginners, but I think its time to move on.  
Nonetheless, the Camera was exceptionally easy to use.  The first thing I noticed when picking it up was that my hands fell right into place, a notch for my thumb and the most important switches, zoom, auto-focus, stabilizer, and the trigger, all within a twitch of a finger.  The LCD was  easily large enough and provided helpful info and a clear picture.  It can flip out and up so that you can take a picture of yourself, and see yourself in the LCD at the same time, Sony Engineers flipped the LCD picture so that it would not appear upside down when taking pictures of yourself, Very Smart.  The pushbutton control arrows felt too soft.  I think they needed a more firm feel to them.  The Menu system was simple and intuitive, the way it should be.  

A great feature worth starting another paragraph for is the video record and microphone, essentially a pint sized digital video camera.  But the Mavica's Number One problem comes back to haunt it here as well, the quality is not blocky and the refresh rate is choppy at best.  It can only save a few seconds of video and audio on the floppy, so you have to be carry lots, and be very quick on the hand with the floppy or the feature really isnt useful for a lot of occasions.  Its more of a novelty than anything.  Though it probably considerably boosts sales with the claim that it can record audio/video movies.

The rechargable battery was sufficient and recharge was decently quick.  The picture quality is good, but the colors aren't vivid enough, in my opinion.  Of course nothing that can't be fixed by Paint Shop Pro and a talented artist.  I didn't see enough difference between the Fine and Normal picture qualities, thought the file size was much larger for the Fine setting, and with a Floppy, the size of your pictures is your primary concern.  

In short, my Recommendation is if you are a real loyal Sony fan and you want a Mavica, the lower end models are more of a bargain than the higher ones, but then again if youre a loyal Sony fan, you're probably into electronics a lot and you won't settle for the middle or bottom of the market.  There are cheaper, smaller, more efficient, digital cameras on the market.  Unless you're alergic to Compact Flash memory and Memory Sticks, I'd seriously consider another line of Digi-cams.
