            Leased this truck in November of 1991 and its still strong nine years later.  Took it all over the east coast of Canada and had many off road adventures in Newfoundland.  I have a bench seat that is straight forward with no frills but amazingly comfortable.  I have driven 18 hours straight on several occasions, only stopping for gas and never got a bad back.  4X4 capability has been first rate as I have never been stuck anywhere (even though I tried on several occasions). As noted by another opinion, the on road handling and cornering is truly excellent for a pick up truck.  Low end torque from the high output 4.0L inline six is excellent as well.  It takes nothing to smoke the tires, however, high end torque isn't the best as passing on the highway can become a chore.  This is true for most pick-ups though.  The engine still starts up first time everytime and sounds almost new, even after 250 000 kms.  Problems: front axle U-joints wear out sooner than I think they should; although not obviously visible, rust is becoming an issue; Chrysler/Jeep service, although improved, has been the cause of much stress in early years; Gas mileage is horrible-seems to be about 16 mpg in the city.
The good stuff: Not too many left on the road-discontinued in 1992; really easy to work on-tons of clearance under body and in engine bay-simple, straight forward parts and construction; good looking truck that will last a long time.  Looking forward to many years of service yet.<br><br>
