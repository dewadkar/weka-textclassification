            Chrysler PT Cruiser

Moments of inspiration often lead to creative products. And hey� whaddya know? Our friends over at DaimlerChrysler have done it again. There seems to be no stopping these guys, as they just keep churning out stunning concept after stunning concept. The key seems to be that the Chrysler people seem to be able to take their gorgeous concept cars and translate them into production vehicles closely resembling those which toured the auto-show circuit.

Remember the Dodge Viper concept? About the only thing that changed from the concept show car to actual production units were the funky four-per-side headlamps. Even the side-pipe exhaust system appeared on the original Vipers, as did the gigantic, fire-engine red V-10 engine. Next, how about the Chrysler Concord that caused such a stir? Yes, it too materialized in Chrysler showrooms looking much the same as it had on the turntable at the auto shows.

Miracles? Hardly. Chrysler is home to some of the most creative minds on the planet. Bryan Nesbitt, the man behind the invention known as the PT Cruiser, is one of the instigators among of this band of rouges. His concept for the PT (stands for Personal Transportation) Cruiser was to take the usefulness of a minivan, shrink it a bit to the point where it would (dynamically) become even more car-like, and then make it something minivans definitely are not: <i>sexy.</i>

Yes folks, the family-hauler/grocery-getter has just grown up. Or rather, it just entered puberty. This might sound like a thinly disguised attempt at injecting some humor into what might have otherwise been a lifeless report on yet another new vehicle, but I assure you that I am quite serious in making this statement.

When you stop to think about it, puberty is exactly what this phase of the minivan's life might rightly be called. These things started off as big four-wheeled boxes that were smaller than conventional cargo vans, but at the same time were more versatile (and packaged better) than the average station wagon (which they effectively replaced). They grew up a bit over the past 16 years, evolving into refined family-haulers stuffed full of neat tricks and gizmos (rear A/C controls, television screens, VCRs, flip-down rear seats, etc.).

Then a strange thing happened. Trucks. Or more accurately, Sport-Utility Vehicles (SUVs). People apparently got sick of conventional minivans (although they still sell well -for now), and started buying Toyota 4Runners, Nissan Pathfinders, GMC Blazers, and Ford Explorers (etc.) like they were going out of style. These things provided the higher seating position of a minivan (and some of the cargo-hauling capacity) without the type-cast soccer-mom image of the more pedestrian minivan.

Seems like minivans were getting boring. People wanted something that projected a more active and interesting image (i.e. something with more of my favorite thing: <i>character</i>) than the kid-hauler image of Minivans. The SUV met this need nicely, adding a measure of safety and off-road capabilities to boot (ever tried to take a Dodge Caravan off-roading? Trust me -this is <i>not</i> advised).

However, SUVs are far from perfect. Not only do they eat gas, but they weigh a ton and they tend to mangle smaller automobiles when they whack them on the road. They also mean higher insurance premiums, expensive tires, and yes �higher prices. Clearly a need existed for something in-between. A few companies have introduced smaller SUVs (Toyota RAV4, Honda CRV, etc.), and these are selling strongly. Problem is, they lack the cargo space of larger SUVS (and minivans), and also (apparently) the cachet as well.

So, something needed to be done to rectify this apparently gaping market niche. Of course, who better to fill this void with the perfect product than the company that started it all 16 years ago with the first real minivans (the VW bus doesn't really count -it was rear-engined and loading cargo was a royal pain in the you-know-where)? Yep �you guessed it, Chrysler. The minivan people are at it again, only this time they've created something that not only appeals to the practical side in each of us, but simultaneously manages to stir the soul at the same time.

The PT Cruiser <i>is</i> the minivan in puberty. I project that once the public digests about a gazillion clones of this lovely little utility vehicle, yet another type of &quot;crossover&quot; vehicle will emerge: the SUVAN (Sport-Utility Van). These things will really and truly be a hybrid mix of a minivan and an SUV. They will offer the cargo hauling (and seating) capacity of a minivan (think 5 to 7 people), and the ground clearance and style of an SUV. Imagine this: enlarge the PT Cruiser by about 25% (but don't make it too tall), add a beefy off-road-capable fully-independent suspension, keep the cool styling, and add a pile of additional horsepower. Either that or picture a Volvo Cross Country wagon, beefed up a bit in the areas of ride height, cargo capacity, and styling.

So, let's check out the automotive industry's first pubescent people-hauler with style. Even from a distance, the PT Cruiser simply cannot be mistaken for anything other than what it is: a totally unique form of transportation. DaimlerChrysler has apparently known for some time what some other manufacturers are either still learning, or simply forget: style sells. And simply put, the PT Cruiser <i>rocks.</i>

Reminiscent of what was on the road during the Roaring '30's, the tall sides and bulging fenders of the Cruiser are an excellent example of period-retro design interpreted in modern fashion. Like a minivan, the entire back of the vehicle opens up in typical tailgate fashion. I personally would have loved to see another retro design element in the form of Dutch doors incorporated into the design (two hinged doors, opening from the middle like those on a cargo van). Visibility of course, would be diminished, but the visual theme of a stylized delivery truck would be complete.

If the Plymouth Prowler's nose were to evolve a bit, it might look a lot like the front end of the Cruiser. I must admit that I love the giant front grille and bulging front fenders with integrated headlamps, but the big ugly front bumper simply <i>has</i> to go. They could have integrated it as well, or at the <i>least</i> painted it the same color as the rest of the body.

In fact, one of the concepts shown at the SEMA (Specialty Equipment Manufacturer's Association) show in Las Vegas did just that. Interestingly, this same concept vehicle also featured a 200hp turbocharged engine and even larger flared fenders. There are rumors of this vehicle possibly being put into production as the Dodge GT Cruiser, but as of this writing (05/2000) they are only that: rumors (although I do expect this to happen sometime soon, or possibly a V6 variant).

One area where I think this vehicle sorely lacks is wheel and tire size. The proportions are correct for some nice fat wheels in the back (think Prowler, only not quite so big), perhaps something about 18 inches in diameter instead of the standard 15 inch wheels or the 16 inchers.

I absolutely love the chrome door handles, tailgate handle, and the flashy Chrysler emblem on the back end. These are all appropriate period touches which only add to the look of the vehicle, in my opinion. Also beautiful are the integrated fog lamps on the front, and the bulging rear turn signals and marker lamps. However, the single most important styling element which effectively ties this vehicle together are the bulging lower rocker panels. These not only make the vehicle, they help prevent its true height from being quite so obvious.

This is a tall vehicle, and this translates directly into interior space -lots of it. The PT Cruiser is surprisingly roomy inside, and feels a lot like a smallish minivan (which, I suppose is precisely what it is). There is roomy seating for four (sorry -no third row seat is available), although in reality it's cargo capacity is close to that in many mid-size SUVs (Lexus RX300, Jeep Cherokee, Infiniti QX4, etc.). However, it is configured differently, and it really seems more like a minivan without the extra three linear feet or so afforded by the space normally taken up by the rearmost seat.

A nice option, one can specify a folding front passenger seat, which definitely adds to the versatility of the Cruiser. Without it, bringing home a stack of 8 foot 2x4 lumber from the local home center is simply not going to happen. With the rear seats removed, the cargo area is a surprising 64 cubic feet, or the equivalent of about 5 times the size a Toyota Camry's trunk. That's enough room for a lot of groceries (we're talking about the quarterly trip to Costco here). With the rear seats installed, there are still 19 cubic feet available, or enough room for a weekend's worth of stuff for the family (think really large trunk).

Seating is comfortable in all positions (that would be five, if you squeeze some poor soul into the middle spot in the back), although not fantastic. Blame the seat-designers for this. In typical Chrysler minivan fashion, the seat cushions feel a little flat and are not quite long enough for my (average) length thighs. Worse yet, they are not height-adjustable (this <i>really</i> bugs me), and the dreaded fold-down Chrysler minivan armrests are unfortunately attached to the front seats. I hate these things. Not only are they too skinny to be much good, they are simply an uncomfortable thing to rest your elbow on.

A nice design touch, portions of the dash are painted the same color as the outside of the vehicle. Although I love the color-matched interior parts, I am not nuts about the rest of the dash design. It definitely makes me want to scream, &quot;MINIVAN!&quot;. However, the cue-ball shift knob on the 5-speed manual shifter almost makes up for it. Lovely touch. It is a shame that you must give this lovely shifter up when you check the option box for the 4-speed automatic transmission.

Speaking of the drivetrain, the 5-speed manual is definitely the way to go if you want to extract any semblance of performance-oriented, spirited driving out of the Cruiser. Sure, it feels very solid and actually handles well for it's height, but this puppy is definitely underpowered. With the automatic transmission, the 2.4 liter engine feels about a liter too small.

This is a major faux pas, if you ask me (and you clicked the link to this review, so in a way you did! *L*). 150 horsepower might feel like a lot in something the size of a Honda, but in a vehicle weighing in at almost 3,200 pounds (unladen), this is barely enough to put a faint grin (more of a smirk, to be honest) on the face of an enthusiast. Then again, as sharp-looking as the Cruiser is, I somehow doubt it is being marketed to (or that most buyers will be) driving enthusiasts. However, should that turbocharged variant ever come to market, that opinion could change very quickly. :-)

So, how does it drive? In essence, a lot like a car -and a lot like a minivan at the same time. You could either shrink a minivan and get something close, or you could make a small station wagon taller and it would have the same effect. The PT Cruiser is a little top heavy, but not overly-so. In fact, I was very impressed with the way it handled quick turns (most of mine are) and fast curves (ditto). It felt very solidly planted, and actually carved up one of my favorite Southern California canyons (Coldwater) with more gusto than I expected.

I would have to say it drives more like a tall station wagon than a minivan, although it also feels almost as tall as a minivan. Again though, this stylish family-hauler definitely needs more oomph. 0-60 in eight and a half seconds (with the 5-speed) is decent, but it really wasn't an exciting or memorable 8.5 seconds. Perhaps the more enthusiastic note of an aftermarket exhaust could liven things up a bit?

All in all, I would have to say that I liked driving this vehicle. I was certainly the center of attention everywhere I went, to say the least. The amount of attention this thing attracts brings to mind only one other vehicle, the VW New Beetle. Yes, your new Cruiser will turn heads -something no minivan can lay claim to <i>ever</i> having done. The packaging of this vehicle is unique, offering the versatility of a small minivan, and the drivability of a tall car. This is a cool combination, and I could easily see one of these things in my driveway, were it not for a few possibly fatal flaws.

First off (as I've already mentioned several times), the Cruiser needs more power. Anything I am to drive on a daily basis must be more entertaining than this vehicle was. Although not a bore, it certainly does not bring the word &quot;fun&quot; to mind. I also did not drive the Cruiser with any cargo loaded in the back. I would imagine that a fully loaded Cruiser would be downright sluggish; the type of vehicle you would avoid taking uphill at all costs.

However, easily the most important reason I would be hesitant to buy one of these charming retro-mobiles is the fact that it is a Chrysler product. I love Chrysler's exterior design abilities (and I imagine a lot of other manufacturers envy their design talent), but their product quality is definitely questionable in my books. How many 10 year old Chryslers do you see on the roads (Jeeps excluded)? Not many. At least I don't seem to notice them if they are out there. This tells you something. On the other hand, once Toyota copies this design (Toyota are the masters of cloning things), you can bet there will be a higher-quality competitor on the roads. Also, something that <i>really</i> bugs me (in principal) is the fact that ABS is optional(!). Two thumbs (way) down for that one, Chrysler.

For my money, the <i>design</i> of the PT Cruiser is hard to beat, but I would wait a few years until the integrity of the design and the overall product quality become known before buying one. However, my wife is absolutely nuts about this sexy people-mover, so I may well end up eating my words if that turbocharged version becomes available anytime soon. ;-)

I hope you found this Epinion of the PT Cruiser to be informative and helpful in your quest to find the perfect vehicle for you (or perhaps just a good read).  If so, please rate this review highly! Thanx! <i>~Matt</i>  <b>:-)</b><br><br>
