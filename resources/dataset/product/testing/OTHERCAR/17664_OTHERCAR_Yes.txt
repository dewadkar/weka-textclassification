            What would it take for you to actually carry around a camera all the time? I've searched far and wide for a camera that I'll actually take around with me more often than not to capture those candid moments. I figured that it had to be light and small, have a decent battery, digital but capable of printing standard pictures, and be easy to use. I wanted zoom and something that would snap pictures fast. I've seen how slow many digital cameras are and that wouldn't really do for those special moments.

After a long and painful search that included the Minolta Dimage and Canon Elph, I finally settled on the Casio Exilim EX-S2. Is it perfect? Not quite, but it's good enough for me, and I do actually carry it around to catch a whole slew of pictures that I never would have bothered with otherwise. The main points that sucked me in include:

1) Size. It is just so unbelieveably small, it's unbelievable. But it's not chintzy like those gimmicky pen cameras or cube cameras. It will draw "ohs and ahs" even non-tech nerds.

2) Quality. It's a nice feeling camera that feels solid and well made.

3) Viewfinder. The LCD is small but very clear and legible.

4) Decent features. It's not the Canon G2, but it's got enough features for day-to-day use. It has white balance, different modes, and an easy to use interface.

5) SD card. I have a Pocket PC so SD is the format that I'd rather use. And with a 256 MB SD card in there, I snap shots like they are free (which they basically are).

6) Inexpensive. At $300, you can't really go wrong. All of the other cameras in this price range are bulky and at the same megapixels.

7) Fast. It turns on fast, and it shoots pictures fast.

8) Printable pictures. You can print the pictures at a standard 4x6 size. Any bigger and it starts to look ugly.

The downsides?

1) Zoom sucks. Turn it off. Any optical zoom would be nice.

2) Fixed focal length. Forget about your dreams of being artistic with the super close-up. Unless part of your artistic touch includes blurriness.

3) More megapixels. It'd be just so sweet if it could be 3 megapixels.

I'm sure some future version will address all of these points, and when it does, I'll have to jump on it because it is the definitive digital point and shooter for me. If I have a specific arranged Kodak moment, I'll go for the SLR camera, but otherwise, I've shot more pictures with this thing in a few months than I have probably all the rest of my pictures combined. It's hard not to love this camera, even if you are a camera snob, as long as you accept it as a day-to-day point and shooter.
