            Ok, like many of you, I am not the richest person in the world. My family has a wonderful old car though. Its an old white chevy suburban. I always hear my friends complain of their parents' embarassing old piece of junk cars, that are totally something to be ashamed of. My suburban is just as old, a '91, and I am honestly fond of it. It has stayed together well, it has enough room, good sounding speakers, the air conditioner works, never falls apart--hey, what more could I look for? If you are one of those people who would rather spend money on clothes and games and such, but don't want a brand new expensive car-go for an old suburban. I promise all of you, on my car, that I have not once regretted having it. It is a good ol' girl and I hope it will stay with us for good deal into the millinium.<br><br>
