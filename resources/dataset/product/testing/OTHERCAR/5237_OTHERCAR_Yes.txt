            I bought the Mitsubishi Mirage to replace my 92 Ford Tempo - a car I had such major problems with that I decided to just junk it and move on.  The Mirage was a great choice for me.  I am a college student living about 400 miles from home, and I needed a reliable car to get me back and forth, and also to keep me safe while I drive around the Los Angeles area.  The car handles so nicely, the brakes are great, gas mileage is fantastic!  I can make it from LA to Northern California on one tank of gas - with a ten gallon tank.  

The only drawback on this vehicle is that the back seat is a little small for three people.  Other then that, I just love it.  A sun roof, cd player, a great shape and gas mileage.  I think this car is perfect for anyone who is looking for a nice, afordable, and safe vehicle.  Enjoy!
