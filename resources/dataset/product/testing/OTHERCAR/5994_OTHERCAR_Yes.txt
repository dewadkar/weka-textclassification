              I recently bought my 1995 Eagle Vision ESi, and already I love it.  It's also my first car, and I couldn't ask for anything better.  First, let's delve into it's looks.  The Eagle Vision is a wonderful eye-full.  The well defined V curve on the front is gorgeous, and looks better than that of the much similar Dodge Intrepid.  Adding to the car's splendor, the sunroof gives it a very sporty look (although that option may not be available in every car), as does the low front and raised tail end.  The interior of the car is stunning, and very comfortable.  As far as comfort goes, adjustable seat belt heights are nice, and so are the lumbar seats (although that option as well may not be available in every car).  The car has an amazing amount of room too, and that is really nice, especially on road trips, or taking a bunch of friends out.  The 3.3L ESi has plenty of power, and is a blast to drive.  The steering is tight, and the car handles very well, although on snow the car does slip and burn is the brake or gas is pressed (yeah, just pressed; the acceleration is great, as is the braking power).  The 1995 Eagle Vision ESi is a wonderful, amazing car with lots of room, looks, and fun, and I'd recommend it to anybody that's looking at purchasing, leasing, or renting one. ~qx
