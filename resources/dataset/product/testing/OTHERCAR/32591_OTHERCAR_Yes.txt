            I have had my SL since November of 96 (97 model year) and it's been great.  I liked the ease of the purchase- no haggling is quite a relief.  My car averages 40 miles per gallon and I do all city driving.  In addition, it has almost 60,000 miles on it and it runs very well.  In retrospect, I wish I had power steering but then again, who knew I'd end up moving to a city!  I have also taken it to a variety of Saturn dealerships for service and have found most of them to be honest and forthright in their dealing with me.  I do think tall people might want to consider the newer L series as my tall friends are pretty miserable for long drives.  This is a great car for single women like me especially if you get the Car Care Package- nothing to worry about if something breaks down or you get a flat tire.  I have no regrets about the purchase of my car and will definitely stay a part of the Saturn family<br><br>
