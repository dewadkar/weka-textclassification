            Our family bought the '94 model of this car used in '97 after the one I learned to drive died, so it was really the first car I drove besides that one. I immediately loved it! It is so easy and fun to drive. I am now 19 and in college and I love the weekends when I get to go home and drive &quot;my&quot; car. It was inexpensive (our single-parent household can't afford too much extravagance!) and we have had no problems with it besides having to get new tires because we drive it so often. The only thing I can sad bad about it is that it has no passenger-side mirror. No, I didn't knock it off backing out of the garage, it came that way. I know models from other years are not like that; I don't know what the deal is.<br><br>
