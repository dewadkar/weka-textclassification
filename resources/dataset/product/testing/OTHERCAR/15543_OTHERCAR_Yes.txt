            I had always wanted a convertible so when I was ready to get a new car that is just what I got.  I had looked at Sunbirds and Cavaliers but I wanted something with power which is just what I got with the 3.4 DOHC V6 in my Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme Convertible.  I would have liked a Trans Am or a Z28 but they are just not economical in the cold northern winters.  When i bought it in November 1998, it had 48,000 miles.  

I have had several problems with my car:  The 2nd day I had it when I started the car it would rev to high rpm's then it would quit.  To keep it running on a cold day I had to put it in gear and just go.  The problem, after 6 trips to the dealer, was the intake manifold gaskets were bad.  A few months later I found out my top had been leaking and filled my spare tire compartment with water.  Instead of the replacing the very expensive vinyl top, I had a local mechanic apply windshield sealer to the broken seal on my rear window and I haven't had a problem since.  At about 55,000 miles my brakes and rotors went bad and shortly after that my drivers side door handle broke.  Presently at 66,000 miles the passenger side door handle is broken as well and I am in the process of getting a new one.  

Overall I love my car and i would buy another if I had the chance.  Too bad they quit making them.  I would opt against the white leather unless you love to clean.  Plan to have some spare cash accessible for occasional shop visits.
