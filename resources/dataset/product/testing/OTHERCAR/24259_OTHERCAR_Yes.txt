            I'm not a big fan of digital photography.  I really like a good old fashioned picture.  But I also really like being able to send pictures of my daughter to her father and godparents without having to take negatives to the photo shop, wait for the copies, then mail them out.  So I really needed a digital camera.  

A year or so ago, I bought a Sony Cybershot for around $249, which was the cheapest thing I could find with greater resolution than .3 mp. It was a great camera and I had no problems with it, but I took it back because I felt like it was just too much camera for me!  Like I said, when it comes to digital photography, it's the speed and efficiency that interest me.  For beautiful photographs, I'll stick with 35mm.  I was thrilled to find that you can finally get a 1 mp camera for around $100.

The HP 120 is very easy to use, and I'm impressed with how quickly it uploads images.  Outdoor pictures are sharp and the color is bright and true to life.  Indoors it's a little different.  As mentioned in other reviews, the flash can be too bright in some indoor settings, and washes everything out, while not using the flash leaves you in the dark.  Putting your finger over the flash is an adequate if unwieldy solution to this problem.  I do have a hard time getting this camera to take a decent shot indoors at night - even in my living room which has two 100 watt overhead lights.  Even when you get adequate lighting for an indoor shot, the colors do look a little too bright and artificial (just a little). But I find this a perfectly acceptable compromise for the price I paid for this camera.  In a $300 camera, these pictures would suck, but in a $99 camera, they're great.

I'm not crazy about the LCD screen.  The small size is fine, but without good lighting it's very difficult to see anything at all through it.  Personally, I wish that I could sacrifice the LCD screen for better indoor image quality or an optical zoom.

The optical viewfinder doesn't seem to reflect the image through the lens, and so you have to compensate for its inaccuracy.  The first few pictures I took with it had a baby with her head chopped off.

The 2x digital zoom is of limited use.  I sell stuff on ebay, and I find that it's fine to get a closer shot of a still object, but if I use the zoom on my daughter, the distortion is excessive.  

The video feature is also of limited use.  It's fine for outside, but doesn't work well indoors, and I would have preferred to have had more internal memory.

One problem I've had with this camera is with the internal memory.  You can store 12 pictures at "best" quality, which is fine, but if you review the images and delete some of them, sometimes the camera doesn't register this change, and won't let you store the whole 12 pictures.  Example:  I take 9 pictures, then review the pictures on the LCD screen, and I delete 3 of them.  I now have only 6 pictures stored, and I should be able to take six more, but it will only let me take three.  I've found that shutting the camera off and turning it back on will solve this problem.

The shutter lag is pretty long, but I think this is to be expected.

This camera seems to me to have pretty good battery life.  The batteries last a lot longer than they did in the Sony Cybershot that I had.
