            <b>VROOOOOOM!!!</b>
Man, this car is a little pocket rocket.  I just bought mine two days back and haven't stopped grinning yet.  It is a blast to drive, loaded with great options and offered at a respectable price.  I am somewhat surprised to see that the 2002 Subaru Impreza WRX is not listed as a comparison vehicle.  I traded in my 2002 WRX auto/shiftable transmission for this Spec V and I have ZERO regrets about it.  Don't get me wrong, the WRX is a lot of fun to drive with its 227hp turbo inline 4 cylinder.  But, when it comes to best value for your money, I have to say I think Nissan offers a better package with the Spec V.  And it's styling is pleasing to the eye.

<b>BUILD QUALITY</b>
Build quality on the Spec V feels solid.  I like the layout of nearly everything in the Spec V.  I experienced problems with the WRX's lack of build quality.  It's an award winner for its performance, not its build quality.  The WRX had to have the front suspension completely replaced after three attempted repairs to the creaking struts - normal city driving.  Multiple other repair visits for the computer dying resulting in a week without the car by no fault of my own, and several other interior creaking and rattling problems with loose hardware.  Nissan, on the other hand, usually builds a quality product.  This is the fifth Nissan I've owned and I have no build quality complaints on any of them.  Maybe I've just been lucky, but four previous problem-free cars?  Hard to believe it's a coincidence.  The Spec V feels solid, sounds solid, and is quite comfortable.

<b>PERFORMANCE</b>
Acceleration off the line and throughout the gears is quite impressive.  In fact, I don't feel too much of a difference in overall performance between the two so far.  The Spec V is lighter, which offsets a little of the difference in the horsepower gap between it and the WRX.  Also, the Spec V is a normally aspirated engine.  For those of you who are not too familiar with engines, let me explain.  The WRX has a 227 horsepower engine -- it's a 2.0 liter 4 cylinder engine with a turbo charger strapped on.  Pressure builds up and comes on like an explosion of power when the turbo kicks in.  BUT YOU HAVE TO LET IT BUILD PRESSURE.  This means there are gaps in that release of power, commonly referred to as "Turbo Lag."  Ask anyone with a turbo engine, one that is not full time turbo, and they should be able to explain the woes of turbo lag.  Now, the Spec V has no turbo charger.  So, while it is rated at 52 less horsepower, its power comes on instantly.  Especially if you know how to drive a manual transmission.  True, your quarter mile runs and 0-60 will be faster with the WRX, but feeling all of the engine's power when YOU want it is preferable.  If that turbo's not spooled up, it's pretty much like a lower powered 4 cylinder.

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
My goal here is not to upset WRX owners -- I still hold a special place in my heart for mine that I owned for a year.  My goal is to educate someone who may be looking at the WRX for it's performance, but cannot afford the pricey payments.  I say if cost is a factor, go with the Spec V and be happy.  If cost is not a factor(like in my case), test drive them both and see which is more appealing to you.  Like I said -- I went from WRX to Spec V and have ZERO regrets.  I got two of my friends to buy them too!  I think this is an excellent car.  I hope this helps somebody.
