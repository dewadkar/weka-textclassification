            This is our 2nd Dodge Grand Caravan, the first a 1988 Dodge Grand Caravan lasted just over 150,000 miles...we had hoped this one would also...

So we went to our favorite Dodge dealer, and ordered what we wanted...
The color we wanted...
The options we wanted...
The Base price was $20,755.00

The vehicle is front wheel drive, 3.3 L V-6, automatic, 4 speed automatic transmission, Island Teal Satin Glow, with Cloth Hiback Bucket Seats...

We got a few options, the Customer Preferred Group, AC, Power Locks &amp; Windows, lighting, sound insulation, for $2,240.00...

Climate Group...Sunscreen/Solar glass, for $450.00...

The bigger engine, 3.3L SMPI V-6 for $970.00...

Driver side sliding Door...for $595.00...

Last but not least the Luggage Rack for $175.00...

Although the vehicle was made in Fenton Missouri, just 35 miles from our home, the Destination charge was still a lofty $580.00...

As we had a previous Dodge Grand Caravan, we got $1000 off...

Wow...

We like the vehicle...it runs well, it is great and roomy for the kids, and handles well...of course, the gas mileage is so so, about 18-24 mpg, depending on the drive...

But, one problem, at about 50,000 miles, the transmission started slipping, and eventually would not shift out of 1st gear...

We called the Dealer, they had heard of this before, and unfortunately the Warranty was up...so we figured lets get it fixed...some $1,400.00 later...its running...

It seems Dodge has been having problems with this vehicle and its transmission...so we called Dodge, griped, and they paid us back about $708.00 of the cost...

All in all...I don't think a transmission should wear out after only 50,000 miles or so...

We are waiting to see how it holds up before we pass final judgment...

So, it might be a good buy, if the transmission problems are FIXED!!!!<br><br>
