            Before out current vehicle, we had a 1995 Dodge Neon.  It was a standard, had 4 doors and a very bad electrical problem!

Not even a year after owning it (about 25,000 miles), it began to have problems.  If we left the car over night, the battery would die.  And we had to &quot;be jumped&quot;.  Thinking it was a battery problem, we replaced the battery.  Nope, it wasn't that.  The very next day, the battery was dead again!  So, we took it the the shop, and had them do a computer test on it.  They couldn't find anything wrong.  They also checked the alternator.  Nothing wrong there.  

Mysteriously, the next day the car was fine!  It started and drove very good for about a month.  And then started being dead again.  We decided that we would try anything to fix it.  We ordered a new alternator, and installed it.  Still nothing.  We took the car to the shop to have THEM check if we installed it right.  Yes, we did.  Still the car was going dead over night.

One night we disconnected the battery after we parked it for the night, and hooked it back up in the morning.  Low and behold, it started!  

Now, I am NOT a car-buff, nor mechanically inclined at all, but here's my understanding of what my husband thought was the problem.  He thought that there was a short-circuit somewhere.  Why the shop couldn't find it with the computer is anyone's guess.  But, that's the only thing that we could come up with.  

So, we continued disconnecting the battery every night, and it ran just fine!  All the while, we were looking for a new car.

The engine troubles aside (which I imagine wouldn't happen to all the cars), it was a very nice little car!  It was big enough for our family of 4, and drove very well.  I really liked it, until it got that problem. 

The trunk, for one, was great!  Very large for a compact car!  We easily fit everything we needed in there for a long trip!

Besides where ever the people who owned it before went.  The car made a trip from Georgia to Florida, one from Georgia to Arizona (and back) and one from Georgia to Michigan!  All of those times, the only troubles we had was one flat tire!  

I would probably buy another Neon-only not a '95!  It was a very nice car!<br><br>
