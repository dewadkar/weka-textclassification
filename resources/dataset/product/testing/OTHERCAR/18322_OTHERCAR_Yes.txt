            Why rate a car that's no longer being produced? Well, there are plenty on the road and in some demand used and think this is a good medium to give people eager for this as a used car the lo-down on what to expect, and I tend to think that if I had a good experience w/ a particular brand of car before, I may get another one if I buy the same brand as a replacement.  I'm 53.  I've owned American (Chevy - eh, Pontiac - worst experience of my life), European (VW Rabbit - typical German tank-ish w/ mechanical and electrical problems) & American/Japanese joint venture ('86 Nova aka Toyota Corolla - scary little weenie car for commuting and blew a head gasket @ 51k). I've gone from one to another in part looking for some kind of quality and performance.  Now I own a Japanese car built in a former Chrysler plant (Belvedere, IL). I was warned about turbos and premium fuel injected cars -- get the oil changed every 2,500 mi and a container of injector cleaner every 3 fill-ups or so -- and I have followed those cardinal rules.  I bought my '95 in '98 w/ 43kmi on it - it is now 2004 and it has just about 94kmi on it.  I had the 60k and 90k check-ups (90k at a European car care center did a better job than the dealer).  I have never had a single mechanical problem with this car.  Everything still works (a/c in particular, which can be an expensive fix) and the sound system is great (even with my aging hearing).  Handling and braking is unbelievable and it is rock-steady at speeds I wouldn't want to admit to.  I park it mostly outside, probably don't take care of the body/finish the way I should, and there are only 2 minor rust spots (both around the rear hatch window). The car came equipped w/ dual front air bags -- I wish it had ABS or traction control, however.  My peers look at me like I should be 25 or younger and either female or Pacific-rim and sometimes I think it's time for something more sedate -- but I've had sedate cars and won't go back to them.  I therefore would love a new Eclipse (6 cylinder a must - no more turbos and the base 4 is for sissies) ready to endure some of the cons (below) for the overall reliability.  PS one consumer mag rated this particular car as one of the WORST and to avoid -- I don't have a clue why.

Cons: ALL (and I mean that) parts are expensive.  non-mechanical parts are often disappointing (such as plastic door handles -- driver side broke twice @ a little over $200/repair - and windows rattle if not all the way up or down).  some turbo "lag". high idle in summer heat w/ a/c on - makes trans 'kick' when engaged. front 'bumper' height will almost always scrape curb or wheel stops.
