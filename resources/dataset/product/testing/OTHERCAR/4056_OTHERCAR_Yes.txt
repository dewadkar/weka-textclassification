            There is no doubt how much I love this van. Our family had out grown our Buick Regal and it was time for a new car. I wanted a van because of all the trips we like to take as a family and the work I do. 
So I went in search of the perfect van . I had found several I liked but they were way out of our price budget. I ran across a Venture that did not have an automatic door feature ( well if it did the salesman never showed me that feature) I liked it for the price. My husband said he would think about it and that was it for about 3 months. When one night he surprised me with a 98 bright red chevy venture with all the bells and whistles on it.
Since then we have put over 36,000 miles on it and it runs great! 
It has also been through a major wreck it handled and performed beautifully. Of course my favorite feature is the electric door! I have severe arthritis and this has been a life saver. Another favorite feature of mine is the panel that tells you what direction you are going in , the temp., Your average speed ( this has helped me in a few speed traps! (smile) ), and your fuel economy to boot! Like any van be weary of your blind spots . This van has been a dream for me and our family. 
I would like to thank chevy for building a van like this one!
As for my work use I can manage to get three massive 85 lb computer monitors and cases, 3 CPU's, 2 directors chairs, 2 -100 lb table w/cases 
plus a tool box and goodies I use at trade shows. The space is unreal!
Yes, I take out all the seats but the front . But I still have a little room left over.
 I recommend this van highly to anyone!<br><br>
