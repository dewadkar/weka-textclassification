            This 2001 model year Protege has been nothing short of fantastic. The only trips to the dealership in its first year of use have been for oil changes and tire rotations. 

Exterior:

Nice looking vehicle, compact.

Interior:

Quite nice, not much room though. Has been comfortable on the long haul with adult passengers. Once we added a car seat to the back, the rear seats became very tight and uncomfortable. The interior trim is very nice. All controls are easily marked and functional.  Stereo system is adequate. Seating is comfortable for the long haul.

Engine:

Very well powered. Great pick-up for city and highway performance.
I must say that I am entirely satisfied with this vehicle. The engine has never gave a hint of trouble. In fact, we drove this vehicle with three drivers non-stop from Detroit to Orlando. The car performed above and beyond my expectations. My dodge would have died half way there!
Fuel consumption is excellent. We currently get approx. 600km to the tank - that is combined city and highway millage. Even more for highway!
