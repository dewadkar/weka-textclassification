            <b>~~~Background~~~</b>

The Jetta, called "Bora" in Europe and other parts of the world, is the smallest sedan Volkswagen offers in the US Market. The Jetta has been around for a while. It is built on the same platform as the Volkswagen Golf/GTI hatchbacks. It has gone through four major revisions: MKI, MKII, MKIII, and currently <b>MKIV</b>. Its bigger brother is the Passat, a larger family sedan, that is very comparable to the Jetta.

The Jetta comes in four trim styles, from base GL, to middle road GLS, to luxury GLX, and sport GLI. There are also four engine options, the 2.0L I4 gas engine, 1.9L I4 turbo diesel engine (called TDI), 1.8L I4 turbo gas engine (called 1.8T), and 2.8L V6 gas engine (called VR6).

The Jetta can be compared to other cars in several different ways. You can compare the base model GL to cars like the Ford Focus or Honda Civic. However, you can compare GLX models to cars like the BMW 3 series, the cousin Audi A4, or Mercedes C-class, minus a few features and plus a few thousand dollars. Head over to http://www.edmunds.com/ to compare these cars.

<b>~~~Exterior Looks~~~</b>

One of the things that first attracted me to the Jetta was the looks. I always thought the MKIV body style had a simple look to it; understated and very German like. It has a rather high trunk deck, which gives room to a cavernous trunk compartment.

The paint is of a perceived high quality. The colors are very rich. You can choose from Alaska Green (new for 2003, replacing Baltic Green), Black, Campanella White (new for 2003, replacing Cool White), Galactic Blue Pearl, Platinum Gray (new for 2003), Reflex Silver, and Tornado Red.

The base model GL receives the 15" steel wheels with full covers, which, in my opinion, hurt the look of the car. The GLS model receives the new 15" alloy wheels (called Avus), which, in my opinion, aren't as attractive as those found on 1999-2002 models. GLX receives a nice set of 16" alloy wheels, which look very nice in my opinion. Optional on both the GLS and GLX models are 17" alloy wheels called Long Beaches. I think they are the most attractive wheels for the Jetta. The sporty GLI receives 17" alloy wheels called Monte Carlos standard.

Starting from the front, the headlight housing is the home of standard halogen light bulbs. They produce an adequate amount of light at night. Still inside the housing, you'll find amber turn signals, and only on GLX, halogen fog lamps. Between the headlights is the body colored grille, with a huge chrome VW symbol.

Moving to the side of the car, the front bumper has a set of reflectors. Directly behind the front wheel is another turn indicator to warn people beside you. Then comes the body colored mirror housing (power mirrors are standard).

The driver's door is large, but the rear door is rather small. Much of the door is above the rear wheels, due to the rather short wheelbase. On top of the car is the long whip antenna. The rear windshield slopes down to the high trunk, revealing large, yet simple tail lights.

The exhaust pipes are not visible on TDI or 2.0 models. However, if you choose the 1.8t engine, you get two visible exhaust pipes together on the left side. The VR6 gets the same pipes, except they are chrome tipped. They look really nice very slightly sticking out of the rear bumper.

<b>~~~Interior~~~</b>

I think the interior is what makes this car so great. The VW engineers struck gold here. The dashboard, regardless of what interior color you choose, is black. It is made of a soft touch plastic that feels very upscale. The headliner is always gray, and looks very nice (like the Audi headliners). The Air Conditioner vents are of high quality, which can be adjusted by rollers beside and below them.

The steering wheel is of a standard four spoke design for the GL and GLS models. GLX models receive a four spoke wheel with radio and cruise control buttons. GLI models receive a 3-spoke sport wheel. All steering wheels are tilt and telescopic adjustable, making it easier to find the perfect position.

The interior shows attention to detail. The headlight switch stays lit at all times, making it easy to see at night. There is no option for city lights, however. Just off and on. GLX receives fog lamps, which is the first detent when you pull the headlight switch out.

In the instrument cluster, on the left is a large tachometer, and the right a large speedometer (which goes up to 160 mph). At the top is a small engine temperature gauge and gas gauge. In the center is where all the warning lights are situated. GLX models receive a small computer at the bottom, which we will talk about in depth later.

The center console is situated a bit lower than other cars, and is angled ever so slightly to the driver for easy access. Up top is the vents, and below is a row of buttons for various functions (seat heater if equipped, ESP or ASR if equipped, rear defrost, and hazard flashers). Then there is a retractable cup holder (poor design, talked about later), the radio head unit, and air conditioner controls. On the floor console is an ash tray with power point, gear shifter, emergency brake handle, and adjustable armrest.

On the roof, between the small sunvisors with vanity mirrors, is a pair of map lights for the driver and passenger. If the car is equipped with a sunroof, there is a rotary dial to adjust the sunroof.

In the back, the seats are comfortable. However, there is next to no leg room. Because the wheelbase is so short, the back seats are pushed forward. Tall people will be uncomfortable in the back. Keep this in mind when shopping for a vehicle.

GLS, GLI, and GLX receive power windows, with one touch up and down features for the driver and passenger (on driver side control panel). There is a window lock switch too. Power locks is standard on all models, with a standard flip out remote too.

Door handle pulls are nice looking and easy to reach. The doors make a nice solid sound when closing them, and inspire confidence in the rigidity of the car.

The interior is a very nice place to be in. You can choose leather, velour, or cloth, all of which come in black, gray, or beige.

<b>~~~Engines~~~</b>

The base model engine is a <b>2.0L</b>, 8 valve gasoline engine. It peaks out at <b>115 hp</b>, with <b>122 lb.ft. torque</b>. This engine is economical and sufficient for moving the car. You won't win any races or fling off on-ramps into traffic, but it gets the job done.

Next up is the turbo diesel, called the <b>TDI</b> (Turbo Direct Inject). As the only sedan offered in the US right now with diesel, VW did an excellent job. It is 1.9L, churning out a low <b>90 hp</b>, but spunky <b>155 lb.ft. torque</b>! The highest point to this model is its fuel economy. This sedan frequently sees mileage in the 40-50 miles per gallon range. Highway drivers will see huge savings coming in, getting 500-700 miles per tank. Check out www.tdiclub.com for specific information on this engine.

Then comes the battle of the high performance engines. There is a 1.8L gasoline engine with a turbocharger on it called the <b>1.8T</b>, producing <b>180 hp</b> and <b>173 lb.ft. torque</b> at a remarkably low 1950 RPM. The engine, shared with Audi, has five valves per cylinder, making a total of 20 valves. The engine suffers from very little turbo lag, which is very good for smooth driving.

Finally comes the one-of-a-kind <b>VR6</b> engine developed by Volkswagen several years ago. Engineers wanted to fit a V6 engine into the Jetta/GTI engine bay, but it was too small. Engineers decreased the angle between the two banks of cylinders to 15 degrees, making it possible to fit six cylinders under the hood. The result? The 24v VR6 engine producing <b>200 hp</b> and <b>195 lb.ft. torque</b>. It features a dual-stage variable intake manifold and variable valve timing. Both the GLX and GLI receive this engine, the GLX with a 5 speed automatic, and the GLI with a 6 speed manual.

<b>~~~Transmissions~~~</b>

I only have experience with the 5 speed automatic Tiptronic transmission. This transmission is very smooth shifting, and can have a "sport" mode where you can choose when you want it to shift. Though it is a nice feature, I found it more as a gimmick feature that I hardly ever use. The transmission usually does a good job finding the right gear. Sometimes I wish it would shift a bit earlier, as in closer to 2000 RPM. The transmission is a bit slow to shift at redline, but is adequate. My 24v VR6 mated to a 5 speed automatic transmission does 0-60 in about 7 seconds.

I have not tried the manual transmissions or the 4 speed automatics. I imagine they are up to par with the 5 speed Tiptronic transmission. The GLI gets a 6 speed, close ratio manual transmission geared more toward sports. I have heard good things about this transmission, and would expect it to be nice.

<b>~~~Performance~~~</b>

My Jetta is a GLX model equipped with the VR6 engine. The VR6 is very capable, with lots of torque all over the rev range. The engine pulls really strongly all the way up to the 6500 RPM redline. Where the engine really begins to open up is starting at 3000 RPM, where you begin to get pushed back in your seat. The VR6 hums a throaty growl at higher RPMs, which always puts a smile on my face as I pass someone or merge into traffic.

Though I haven't spent much time with the 1.8t, 2.0, or TDI, I can speak through things I have heard.

The 1.8t is very capable too, with very little turbo lag. The engine pulls strongly to the 6500 RPM redline, and the turbocharger is not very loud - it only sends out a faint whistle. When it is very hot outside and the engine is at idle with the A/C running, I have heard the engine loses some of its spunkiness. However, as soon as you get the RPMs a little higher, the turbo spools up, and you're back.

The 2.0, I have heard, is an economical engine that won't get you where you need to go faster than the 1.8t or VR6. It scoots around with adequate power.

The TDI is extremely fuel efficient. I heard the torque keeps the car going really well at highway speeds, without the need to shift going up the slightest grades.

Schedule test drives with all these engines to see which one will suit your needs the best.

<b>~~~Braking~~~</b>

All Jettas receive four disc brakes with an Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS) as standard equipment. The discs up front are vented and completely fill up a 15" wheel. The rears are solid, and very small, but keep this sedan under control.

The brake feel is excellent. Braking is very linear, and the pedal feel is nice. I have not experienced brake fade or warped rotors at all. The braking distance is excellent; Edmunds rated the 1.8t as stopping from 60-0 mph in a mere 122 ft. That number should inspire confidence in the driver.

However, when you fit four mid-sized people in the car, braking efficiency decreases rapidly. The driver can feel the extra strain on the brakes in the pedal. It takes a lot more effort to slow or stop the sedan when it is fully loaded.

The ABS works very well. It has engaged several times under hard braking in dry and wet conditions. The pedal pulsates quickly and you hear a faint noise from the engine compartment. The sedan halts quickly to keep you from wrecking.

<b>~~~Stability Control (ESP)~~~</b>

Now available on all Jettas is the Electronic Stability Control. This is an excellent safety feature. The system consists of sensors that detect the movement of the car, and compares that to where you have the steering wheel pointed and how much gas you are giving the car. If the car begins to leave the intended course, based on how you are steering, the system automatically applies brakes to the appropriate wheel to keep you on course.

The system was developed by Mercedes-Benz several years ago, and has made its way into Volkswagen's line-up. ESP is an option on the GL and GLS models, and standard on GLX and GLI models.

<b>~~~Safety~~~</b>

All Jettas come standard with dual front airbags, front torso airbags, and front and rear head curtain airbags. The front seats receive seatbelt pretensioners, which tighten the seat belt and loosen all slack in the event of an airbag deploying. Jettas have daytime running lights (DRL). All five passengers receive a headrest of their own.

Crash test results have been good for this car. It is a solid, rigid little car that inspires confidence in the driver.

<b>~~~Security~~~</b>

All Jettas have alarms, Engine Immobilizers, and stereo theft prevention. These factors make it difficult to steal the vehicle or even break in without setting the alarm.

<b>~~~Features~~~</b>

Standard on all models is power mirrors. A little knob adjusts the outside mirrors, which are also heated. The sunroof is controlled by a dial on the ceiling, which allows it to tilt up or down, and slide back and forth. The air conditioner features a dust and pollen filter, with controls on airflow and temperature. All Jettas have rear defrosters, operated by a small button under the vents.

Optional is ASR, a type of traction control that limits wheel spin from the front wheels. You can step up to ESP, which includes ASR, for around $200-$300. You can get five-stage heated seats also.

Leather seating is an option too. Colors come in gray, beige, and black. Included in the package is leather covered seats, steering wheel, emergency brake lever, and doors. The leather is of a nice quality that seems to be very durable.

I really like all the small details the engineers added. For instance, the fuel cap is notched so you can rest it on the fuel door. There is a metal guard piece on the trunk liner that looks nice. They threw in a <b>full size spare tire</b> (no doughnuts anymore!). The headlight knob is lighted all the time so you can see it when it's too dark. Also, when you turn the car off, the radio stays on until you pull the key out. When you pull the key out, all the interior lights turn on to help you see. The car remembers if you left the radio on when you turned the car off, and if you did it turns it on when you start the car. You can even listen to the radio when the car is off and the key is not in the ignition! Excellent details in my opinion.

The floor mats button to the floor so they don't move around, which I think is a great idea (why didn't anyone think of that before?). The armrest between the front seats can be folded up, and can be lowered at several different angles. VW really did sweat the details.

The GLX model, however, receives most of the goodies.

<b>~~~GLX Specific Features~~~</b>

Raintronic - the windshield wipers have a rain sensor that senses how much rain is falling. The system automatically adjusts how fast the wipers run to adequately clean the windshield. If it stops raining, the system automatically turns the windshield wipers off. Through my experiences, this system works really well and makes it tons easier to drive while it's raining.

Multi-function Trip Computer - found between the speedometer and tachometer, displays fuel economy, average speed, trip time, and trip mileage. It also features a thermometer. It displays all sorts of warnings too, completely written out in a nice font.

Auto-Dimming rearview mirror - this feature automatically dims the rear view mirror if a bright source of light comes from behind the car. It can be switched off.

Climatronic - is an automatic climate control system. You set the temperature and push Auto, and it automatically keeps the temperature at the specified setting. This is my favorite feature of the car. It works very well and is very easy to use.

Wood trim - genuine wood trims is found on the dash, shifter, and doors. It looks really nice, in my opinion.

Auto dip down right mirror - when the car is shifted into reverse, the right outside mirror tips down to get a view of the curb.

Driver and front passenger 8-way power seats with 3 memory functions - the seats move in eight directions, and you can link a specific key to each memory setting. The memory settings save your seat position and mirror settings.

Rear sunshade - GLX throws in a manual rear sunshade to cover the rear windshield.

Fog lamps - halogen foglamps are very nice to have for foggy or rainy conditions.

Extra ambient lighting - there are two red LEDs that are in the bottom of the rear-view mirror. They point downward and provide a subtle source of red light that matches the rest of the interior. They light up the the general center console area and cupholders if anything is there.

<b>~~~Comfort~~~</b>

The seats are very comfortable. I can spend long hours in this car if needed. Side bolstering is adequate, not too supportive and not flat. The GLI receives sport seats, which hug you a little more. Overall, the Jetta is a very comfortable car, except for the small rear.

The seats are height adjustable with a small crank handle. The seats recline with a knob (many complain about it), it has adjustable lumbar support (with a knob), and you can slide it back and forth. GLX throws in power seats, which powers everything except lumbar support.

The dash has a soft touch which is very pleasing to the finger. All materials feel very high grade and upscale, like something found in the cousin Audi A4.

<b>~~~Sound~~~</b>

My car came equipped with the 200 watt Monsoon system which includes eight speakers, two in each door, that sound pretty good. I pretty much like the system a whole lot, but certain singers' voices seem to overpower the speakers. I do, however, love the radio controls on the steering wheel (only GLX models).

<b>~~~Trunk Space~~~</b>

The trunk is very large. The rear seats fold down so you can fit a lot of things in the trunk. The trunk is operated either by sticking the key in or pressing the trunk button on the remote. At the base of the trunk, between the trunk space and bumper, is a metal guard that looks really nice and protects the car.

<b>~~~Squeaks/Rattles~~~</b>

Something that seems out of place for this car is the rattles. Randomly here and there I hear small rattles or squeaks that just aren't consistent with the excellent build quality of the car. I don't know why there are so many at so few miles. Perhaps it is because there are so many trim pieces that rub together? I will take it to the dealer to fix under the warranty.

<b>~~~Problems~~~</b>

I do not like the sun visors. They are too small, and seem a bit flimsy. They do, however, have nice vanity mirrors on the opposite side.

The cup holders, when retracted, hang down over the radio display so you can't see the screen - bad design in my opinion.

I have gone to the dealer under warranty to fix peddly problems. VWs won't be nearly reliable as, say, a Honda, but it seems like it is very well built. At 9000 miles my check engine light came on, which turned out to be a faulty knock sensor. Before it was replaced, the light turned off. Only time will tell!

The only things that have gone wrong that I've gotten replaced: new windshield wiper blade, window regulator failed (plauged 1999-2002 models, 2003 models are not prone to the problem), and peddly things (rattles, squeaks).

<b>~~~Personal Experiences~~~</b>

I absolutely love this car. It feels so luxurious, and I especially like how the engineers spent so much time sweating the details. It seems like just about every annoyance in a car has been addressed in the design of the Jetta.

I love to take the car for a night cruise with the sunroof open and seat heaters on. At night, everything is back-lit in blue, and all needles and buttons are red. It makes the cabin look really high-tech and nice.

<b>~~~Extra~~~</b>

You can find a wealth of information about Jettas on http://www.vwvortex.com . Check out the forums there to ask a specific question: http://forums.vwvortex.com/zeroforum?id=4 .

Over all, I think the Jetta is a very nice sedan. Although it is small, it is sporty, agile, and rigid. I really like the features found on my GLX and the awesome VR6 engine. Schedule a test drive and give this sedan a look!
