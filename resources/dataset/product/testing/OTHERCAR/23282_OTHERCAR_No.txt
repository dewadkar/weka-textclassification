            What an immense disappointment this car has been. Owned it since Nov 98, here's a partial list of problems:
1. Faulty trip odometer, to replace the entire odometer assembly had to be removed and reset with nasty sticker on dash saying so (elected not to have done)
2. Tires went out at 26,000 miles. Not covered by warranty.
3. Driver and passenger seats make an incessant squeeking noise, that still occurs after several lubrications.
4. Drivers side lock failed at 28,000, had to climb out of passenger side until fixed. Not covered by warranty.
5. Very loud wind noise on drivers side windshield - not covered by warranty.
6. Power steering pump failed at 31,000 miles.
7. Windows rarely stay put, have to constantly roll up about a quarter inch to not hear excessive wind noise. Not covered under warranty.
8. Had to replace spark plug cables. 
9. While driving on the Interstate car mysteriously shuts down, check engine light illuminates, car &quot;hiccups&quot;, luckily I have a manual shift and the car restarts itself. This has happened (5) times since I've owned the car, have taken it in 3 times with no success. Dealer performed a basic tune-up (not even a full tune-up) replaced spark plugs (31,000 miles) charged me $100.00. 
10. Not related to the car, but the dealer Rosen Hyundai in Racine, Wisconsin every time car brought in on warranty or other I have never been given a loaner vehicle, though I've asked everytime. It takes a week or more to get an appointment, and the overall attitude of the maintenance department is very arrogant. A dealer in Milwuakee, Arrow Hyundai has been much more helpful.

other than that an OK car.
Next car is a Honda, not as pretty, but at least I can avoid the dealership till I want a new car. (well actually I want a new car now)

cheers,
