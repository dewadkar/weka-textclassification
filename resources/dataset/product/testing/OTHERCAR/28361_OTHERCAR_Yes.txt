            This car has got to be the the best <b>somewhat affordable</b> car in the world that <i>few</i> can afford (next to the Lamborghini and Ferrari, and what not).

<b>Exterior</b>
Every 10 years, Benz changes the look of their car.  This time, it has most definitely changed for the better.  The curves and stylish looks defines this car as a "pimphatic" icon.  The curves make the car much easier to wash than its old "boxy" design (cuz you know you're always washing this car).  And if you don't think the curves look good, just look on the positive side - it helps the movement and aerodynamics of the car because the wind glides right over it (a possibility, maybe?  :))

<b>Interior</b>
The interior consists of a good leather that isn't wrapped too tight that it hurts, but isn't too loose that it moves all over the place. Basically, the leather is perfect and is comfortable for long or short rides (even better if you get the even softer optional leather).  The wood brings out the luxury in the car and a suggestion:  If you want a more sporty/stylish look, go for the matching wood steering wheel and wooden shiftknob.  That makes the car look even more "pimphatic".  The interior also consists of a soft fabric which matches with the car.  Basically, the car's interior is <i>all good</i>!

<b>Handling</b>
Mercedes, known for its quality craftsmanship in cars, has made this even better than its precedents.  This car has an awesome feature called TouchShift, similar to Lexus's E-Shift, in which you can switch the from automatic to a 4-speed stick without knowing stick and simply tapping your shiftknob to the left or right (to downshift and upshift).  Around turns and curves, this car handles very well, not pushing its passengers to one side of the car or another.  The car's pickup is incredible, even in automatic transmission (even quicker when using TouchShift).  Want to make a turn then get right along with traffic?  Use this car...  This car's handling is incredible and factors into its smooth and comfortable ride.

<b>Features</b>
The features of this car are too many to list.  This car is basically, a <i>robot</i>.  There is nothing this car can't do.  

<i>Navigation/GPS</i>
It's GPS (Global Positioning System) is very handy when you are driving and don't want to flood the pockets with maps.  Simply enter your destination and it will guide you there.  Want to find a place to eat?  Enter the name of the restraunt or even the type of food you want to eat, and you'll be there in no time.  GPS will prove to be a very effective tool in the near future for all cars.

<i>Music</i>
The amazing Bose quality speakers deliver the sound to every point in the car.  These speakers provide for any type of music.  Everything (Navigation, Phone (optional), and Radio) are all operated through a jog-dial, buttons, and a LCD screen.  This is very handy because you do not have a cluttered and confusing interface.  There are many features in the sound options, such as: ambience (small, medium, large), driver optimized, speech, and other ways of delivering sound.  One con to this car is that, for the $80G or some you pay, they don't include a CD player.

<i>Additional Features</i>
ESP - Electronic Stability Protection - this is like traction and a response system to prevent your car from colliding when forced to make a sudden stop.

TouchShift - described up-top

In-dash LCD - In the speedometer area is a small LCD screen that describes many different things depending on what window is selected.  Malfunction?  It will tell you what it is.  Gas?  It will tell you how much you have left.  Navigation?  Want to keep your eyes on the road while getting to your destination?  Simply look down a bit and you'll be guided.

Steering wheel buttons - To keep the driver focused on the road and not buttons throughout the car, buttons are conveniently placed on the steering wheel for easy accessibility.

Windowshade - Too much sun?  Simply raise a shade with a press of a button.

Automatic windows - Most cars only have automatic windows for the driver side (and sometimes even the passenger), but this car has it for every window.

There are so many options to list about this car, that I would never finish.  I'm sure you can visit: http://www.mbusa.com to find all that detailed information.

<b>Conclusion</b>
In conclusion, this car is probably not worth its large amount of money, but is a definite fun thing to drive and use.  This car is the best car I have ever driven and I know that the next car I get, I will take all Benz's standards for granted.

I highly recommend this car for those who can afford it!

<b>CD Player</b>
Well, I finally decided to go and get a CD player, which should be a standard in <i>this</i> car (read above)!  Anyway, the CD player is excellent, despite the fact that it is in the trunk, unlike Lexus's convenient in-dash 6 CD Changer (same thing, just better placed).  

<i>Electronic Difficulties - Due to CD Player?</i>
Also, after installing it, I have experienced a few more electronic difficulties.  Sometimes, when I start the car, the Navi LCD will not come on, despite pressing many buttons (DISP OFF, PWR, almost all)...sometimes the buttons will act, but you can't see what you are doing.  If you have also had this problem, please feel free to post any comments!
