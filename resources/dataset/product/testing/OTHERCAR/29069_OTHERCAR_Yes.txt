            I have had my Jetta for 15 months now, and could not be happier with my investment.  I was a loyal GM consumer until I went to buy my last car, and realized I did not the looks of anything they make anymore.  I do not like cab forward designs, and would see squares in a body vice arcs.  Guess that is caught my attention with the Jetta.  It is built very sturdy.  It reminds me of a 1960's Chevrolet as far as the engineering.  A couple of examples would be the pinned, bar stock trunk hinges, the full frame underneath(no uni-body), and the steel door hinges.  I love the tight steering of the car, and the suspension seems to be balanced very well between stiffness and ride.  The engine has plenty of power for a daily driver, and as an added bonus gets nearly 50mpg(diesel).  It's not a Cadillac nor a Corvette, but most of us are looking for something in the middle anyway.  That is where the Jetta shines, in my opinion, by offering a little from both worlds for a reasonable price.  The extras, heated-height adjustable seats, heated windshield wiper nozzles, and heated mirrors add a nice touch too.  The trunk is very roomy, and the interior is also for the size of the car.  In my experience, four average sized adults have no problem sitting comfortably.  It isn't a Caprice on the inside, but then again it isn't a full size car.
