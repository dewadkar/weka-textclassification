            The first time I saw my future husband's 300ZX, I fell in love (with the car!)  I've been amazed, as time has passed, at how many people stare at
this 300ZX.  It is a 1996, and has literally never been in the shop for repairs.  I am very tall and have plenty of leg and head room.  The only thing that is inconvenient is &quot;2 seats&quot;.  Sometimes I'd like more room, but that's what snazzy little cars are all about!  (Of course, you could get the 2+2 for extra room).  It is a dream to drive.  You zip in and out of traffic and have lots of power to get it done.  Parking is a breeze.  Even though it's a little sports car, it is comfortable as can be.  It's a different world when you get inside and close the doors--comfy, luxurious, and FAST...all in the same sexy little car! <br><br>
