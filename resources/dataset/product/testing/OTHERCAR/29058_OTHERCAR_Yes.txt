               Probably one of the best purchases I ever made was my 1992 Chevy Corsica back in 1995. It looks like just another normal car with 32,000 miles at the time. 65,000 miles and over 5 years later, the car has been in the shop for nothing but tires, brakes, and one alternator. The car has been almost absolutely flawless and I recommend it to anyone. The only complaint that I have is that the paint is chipping but a few paint chips on a 1992 is common. I got PW,PL,PB, and automatic transmission are the options in my white Corsica. 
    The car since I got it has smooth acceleration with a giving suspension that makes any ride quiet and comfortable with enough room for 4-5 people and a lot of luggage space in the trunk. The car has absolutely been a dream and it something that needs to be drivin to be fully appreciated.<br><br>
