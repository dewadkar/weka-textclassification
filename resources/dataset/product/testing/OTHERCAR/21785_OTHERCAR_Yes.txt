            I figured I might as well write an opinion about my most expensive asset, my car. I bought this car, with help from my parents, on August of 1997. Buying the car was an ordeal. Especially from Honda World in Orange County. The salesman was rude, and the finance officer was a plain jackass. I'm sure we could've gotten a better deal, but we ended up buying it anyways.

My car has been plagued with bad luck from the get go. The second day out of the lot, my hood and windshield was pegged by a metal object on the freeway. Oh well, so I got touch up paint and left it at that. One month later, the passenger side window is broken, so I got it fixed under warranty. Then as I'm going up the on-ramp, my transmission skips gears and hangs in neutral for half a second. While in for routine maintenance, they tell me I have a busted CV boot, so they fix it, also under warranty. However, that has been the last of my troubles. Luckily all my troubles ended in the the short warranty period. I don't remember exactly how long it was, but I remember feeling that it was a bit short.

My only big problem with this car is that the police seem to think that every Asian teen or twenty something driving a Civic is a <i>riceboy</i>. I'm sure all of you know what I mean. I've had instances where the CHP officer was pacing me for 5 miles before I got off on my exit. I won't even talk about how many idiots have tried to goad me into racing, or how many of them I actually raced a beat, only because there are too many of them to remember anymore. :~) Yes, there are numerous Civics on the road, but there are good reasons for that. The Civic is reliabe, handles really well, even with cheap balding tires, and saves you gas money.

After four years and 75,000 miles, I can confidently say that Honda's Civic is a well built car. This car isn't the fastest, the sportiest, the cheapest, or the strongest, but it is reliable, dependable, economical in terms of gas, and plain fun to drive.
