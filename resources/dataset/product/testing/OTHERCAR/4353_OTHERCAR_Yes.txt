            Based on the well established European Ford mondeo, the mystique shares almost every feature from the carried over mid sized sedan. This heritage gives the mystique tamed european manners on the roads. The handling is agile, responsive, and slightly touchy, it drives really well. It's suspension is firm and taught and allows minnimal roll while cornering. The mystique and contour was designed to fill the gap between the compact Ford escort and the much larger Taurus. Sadly ford did a really lousy job of advertising it's European descent and instead portrayed it as a large escort. On my Mystique I purchased the 24v DOHC V-6 which comes in handy on the interstate or overtaking cars on those pesky two-lane country roads. But the Mystique also has it's drawbacks. The buttons on the steering column are not lit, leaving you fumbling for vital controls in the middle of the night (Cruise Control.) Ford took alot of cost saving cuts on lots of minor details. The Alarm sytem is almost worthless, although the ignition key has an imbedded chip in it which is thte only key that allows it to start, wwhich leaves me wondering if making copies is going to be a big problem? Also the Terrible styling of the mystique, and contour with it's oversized headlights make many people want to pass it up without even driving it. Ford recently announced that it will terminate the mystique and contour because of plummiting sales and the introduction of the focus which they hope will fill that elusive gap. If you are looking for space you should consider looking at a larger car because both of the rear seats are really cramped. The mystique makes a good commuter car but don't expect to much more out of it.  <br><br>
