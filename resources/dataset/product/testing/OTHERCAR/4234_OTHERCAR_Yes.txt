            !!UPDATE!! I've had this car for over 6 months now, I've put 8500 trouble free miles on it.  They haven't been the easiest miles one could put on a car, yet this car is just like it was when I took delivery in December 01.  I haven't been back to the dealer yet, and I'm getting incredible mileage with this car.  This is officially the best car I've ever owned and I don't see myself getting anything else in the near future unless it's another Aztek.  Anyway the whole point of this update is to let you know that as of July 02, GM has announced $3,000 off the Aztek or %0 for 60 months, which is an incredible deal on a vehicle which in my mind is one of the best in GM's fleet.  If you are even remotely interested in this car, or are even just a little curious, head down to your local Pontiac dealer and give it a drive, you won't be disappointed. !!UPDATE!!


If I had to rate the 02' Aztek on a scale based from 1 to 10 I'd have to rate it a 9.5.  This vehicle is the best vehicle I've ever owned or driven.  That's a fairly bold statement, I've driven many different types of vehicles, yet not one vehicle has fulfilled my needs so well.  I wanted a luxury car, something that had a nice ride and at the same time was very quiet, but I didn't want something that drove and handled like a truck.  Unfortunately the Aztek wasn't that easy for me to find, not because it wasn't there, but because I didn't see it.

The 2001 Aztek is often referred to as the Pontiac Edsel and I have to admit that I was one of the 1st to suggest this when I saw one.  I really didn't like the styling; I was put off by it and never really considered it as a vehicle that I could live with.  Last year I wanted a new car, I was getting older and I was growing accustomed to luxurious amenities provided to me by my girlfriends 2001 Aurora.  I have to admit that jealousy was sinking in everytime I drove her vehicle.  My current car was a 96' Chevrolet Camaro Z28, one of the loudest most uncomfortable cars on the road.  Next thing I new I was looking for a new vehicle.  I figured why not I deserve it, it's a great time to buy.

The next 4 months were absolute torture as I test drove, researched, haggled, looked at, studied different rebates and incentives, and just plain over analyzed every vehicle I considered.  I wanted something that was luxurious and quiet first and foremost, I wanted it to handle like a car, I wanted to be able to throw my mountainbike in the back and go riding whenever I please, and last but not least I wanted it to be able to tow a small boat.  Here are some of the vehicles that I initially looked at, Isuzu Rodeo, Oldsmobile Bravada, Chevy Trailblazer, Ford Escape, Mazda Tribute, Saturn VUE, Ford Explorer, Isuzu Axiom, Saturn VUE, Toyota highlander, and finally last but far from the least the Pontiac Aztek.

At first glance the Isuzu Rodeo was the best pick, it had more power, more torque, more towing capacity, a better warranty, 0% financing, and was one of the cheapest I was looking at(gas mileage wasn't great).  I found a silver one I liked at a local dealer and took it for a test drive, I was really impressed overall and was ready to talk pricing.  This Rodeo wasn't very luxurious, by the way, and the lowest price I could get them down to was $22,500 and all that was included was a tape deck, cruise, power windows and locks and the V6.  Well I told the dealer that I'd have to think about it and I walked away thinking you know that interior seemed kinda cheap.  Anyway, I had plenty of time to check out the competition, so I did. 

Next up the 2002 Oldsmobile Bravada, this was also an awesome truck, but that's what it drove like, and that's what kind of mileage it got.  Other than that it was a very nice vehicle that overall had a nice ride, a great warranty, awesome towing capability, very quiet inside, and the styling was very attractive (to me).  Only 3 things had me shying away from the Bravada, lack of incentives, overall $30k and up price, and the gas mileage was pretty poor.

Next up the 2002 Chevy Trailblazer.  Unfortunately this vehicle was ruled out very early on, it's pretty much the same thing as the Bravada, except the Bravada was a better deal in just about every category.  Although I could've walked away with a Trailblazer for about $5,000 less than a Bravada, the warranty, features, and style more than made up for the price difference.

Next up Ford Escape/Mazda Tribute.  When I headed to the dealership to check them out I was thinking this is it, I found the vehicle I was looking for!  On paper the Escape/Tribute were perfect and I even like the way they looked.  Price wise they were very respectable and mileage was also fairly decent.  I went to the dealership telling them that I wanted to order an Escape custom to my liking.  (They only had 2 on the lot and neither was what I was wanting)  They basically told me that ordering an Escape was impossible and that I would have to find one of my liking through a dealership search.  I told them that's fine, lets give that a shot.  They found an Escape around 60 miles away and offered to pick it up for me for a mere fee of $480.  I told them "well I don't know that I'm even interested yet, I haven't even test driven one".  They did have a fairly loaded XLT on the lot, so we went for a test drive.  The dealership let me take it for around 6 miles 2 of which were on the highway.  Overall I really enjoyed the driving experience, the only thing that really bothered me was a rather large amount of wind noise while driving down the highway.  I remember thinking it's not that bad, overall I liked this vehicle and was ready to negotiate a price.  The dealership would not negotiate below MSRP, and furthermore would not tell me where I could locate the Vehicle I really wanted.  They told me that I'd have to pay MSRP plus the $480.  I told them that was a little steep and I walked away.  I was pretty bent out of shape over their attitude during negotiations, so I decided it would be a while before I went back.  Then I researched the Escape some more, I found out that they were recalled 6 times in 4 months, I also found a forum that discusses nothing but problems with their escapes.  The frequent mechanical and electrical problems that were spoke of eventually turned me off from the Escape.  Oh ya and when I walked away I thought, "boy that interior seemed cheap".

Now on to the Saturn VUE, I really liked this vehicle, it was really nice looking and pretty well quipped for the price and achieved fairly good gas mileage.  Now off to the dealership!  "I'm sorry sir, we have no idea when we'll be getting any in, and currently we have no incentives available" the manager said.  I was really hoping that this vehicle would be ready and have some kind of incentives when I was ready to buy.  The "undentable" body panels and the overall package were really nice, I really wanted to drive one, but alas I was out of luck.  Plus the towing rate was fairly low and I had my doubts about it's ability to tow a small boat.

Next up the Isuzu Axiom, I liked this vehicle also, it was much nicer than the Rodeo, and it had more horsepower, yet it sacrificed nothing in mileage.  What it did sacrifice was the price, at $26,000 starting I was a little weary on how much I was getting for my money.  Also when I drove it I noticed it to have a decidedly tight and bumpy ride.  After considering the poor gas mileage, ride quality, limited cargo capacity, and a fairly steep price, I was back where I started.

Now my last pick of the litter, and probably the Aztek's best competitor, the Toyota Highlander.  This was by far the best vehicle of the previous listed.  It did everything I wanted it to do, it was quiet, powerful, had towing capabilities, plenty or room for cargo and passengers, lots of luxurious amenities, drove alot like a car, and it had the reputation of a Toyota.  Oh ya and one other thing it had, a $28,000 asking price!  I couldn't believe that I was getting so little for my money.  Essentially this was an enlarged Camry wagon, that was around $4,000 more than a comparably equipped Camry.  The price almost took it out of my equasion, but I thought well I'll see how far I could get the dealership down.  I headed to the local Toyota dealership, they had 5 or so in stock.  I looked at the price, they wanted $1000 over MSRP!  I was completely shocked and dismayed, and they had no incentive offers either!  I talked to a salesman and he assured me that they sell at that price.  I looked at Edmunds TMV pricing it was also at MSRP!  The Highlander was now completely off the list.

Now to move on to the winner of my little competition.  Like I said earlier, I never really considered the Aztek when I was looking for a car.  I saw it sitting in the local Pontiac lot with nothing but grey cladding and a sad look of "no one wants me", but one day when I was researching it's competitors, it popped up on the list of competition.  I thought well I could never drive this, but hey lets see what it offers.  

Looking through the different specs of the vehicle I was completely shocked at what all was offered for such a meager amount of money.  The Tek had more cargo room than any of the vehicles that I previously mentioned, yet it was smaller and got quite a bit better gas mileage than all of them.  I went on down the list, only to find it had more standard options, and more optional features than all of the other vehicles I've looked at.  I was intrigued, I thought "wow they've really packaged this thing nicely for the price".  Then I saw the picture and thought "well all I have to do is test drive it and see what it's like then".  Although the first thing I was going to do was read reviews of people who have driven it.  

I started with www.motortrend.com and read their entire article.  They also didn't agree with the styling, but other than that they really liked the vehicle.  Overall they were fairly impressed with the performance of the vehicle.  Acceleration times were above average, and handling was also above average for it's class.  I then proceeded to www.caranddriver.com  where I read again about the styling, but then they went on to say they liked it.  They stated that the Tek was "Lexus" quiet and rattle free.  "The body was rigid and tight, free from rattles and sqeaks."  They also said the ride quality was very good, and the Tek makes you feel it's more expensive than it is.  These types of reviews gave me enough courage to take one of the "no one wants me" vehicles for a test drive.

My girlfriend at first site of the Tek on the lot stated "no way!".  I consoled her and told her we have to get past the styling and give it a shot.  After some heavy coaxing she was ready to try it out.  We talked to a very nice salesman who was willing to help and was absolutely ecstatic to get the keys to a base model white Aztek.  I told him that the vehicle we were driving didn't meet my immediate criteria, but he assured me that we could find one that did, and that this one was the demo they'd been using for test drives.  Looking around the vehicle I was getting more used to the overall appearance, as was my rather more stubborn girlfriend.  I think the thing that really impressed us overall was the quality and appearance of the interior, not to mention the amazing cargo space and overall comfort of the seats.

Now on to the drive.  We started the little Tek that apparently had been sitting so long the battery was near dead, but it seemed to be ok so we proceeded on our drive.  I was really impressed with how quiet and smooth the engine was, while idling I could barely hear it running, nor could I feel it.  Driving down the road it was almost exactly like driving a front wheel drive car, just a little higher with a little more body roll.  We approached 60mph on a 2 lane highway and I noticed almost no wind or road noise, I was very impressed.  The Tek seemed fairly powerful and accelerated adequately.  Please don't get me wrong the Tek is no sports car, but it certainly will take just about any truck based SUV sold.  Overall, the Tek had a pretty strong finish on my list, it drove the best, did the most, cost the least, got the best gas mileage, had more luxury options than all the others, had the best interior, was the most comfortable...... wait a minute, everything was better!  This is the vehicle I'm looking for!  Alright where do I sign the papers!  

Unfortunately, I couldn't get past the looks, and my dealership experience was less than poor.  Depressed and ready to give up, I went home with my tail between my legs, and my heart in my stomach.

A few weeks went by, and the incentives started to fade away, low APR rates and big rebates were extended, but my chances of finding what I wanted were dwindling.  Then one day I was reading an issue of Auto Week at the grocery store.  They were talking about new models and changes for the 2002 model year.  Flipping through the pages I found what looked like a completely different vehicle.  It was still an Aztek, but it had all the goods plus two.  The styling was improved, and the price was dropped on average by about $2,000!  I was completely enthralled, I called a different Pontiac dealer here in Dallas, one that I knew would give me a better experience.  They told me that they were expecting some 2002 Azteks in by December 01' but weren't sure what the models and the options might be.  I asked them if I could order one and if it would be in before the January APR cutoff date.  They said I could try, so I made it my goal to get everything squared away and ready to get my new Aztek.

The dealership I used is known for being fair and having excellent customer service.  If you are wondering which one I used it was Sewell Pontiac, Oldsmobile, GMC, and Cadillac here in Dallas.  I went to Edmunds TMV and got the invoice price of the Tek I wanted with all my options.  I then presented this invoice price to the dealer and agreed to pay $250 over it.  I figured this was a fair price since they weren't really having to do too much for me.  I then ordered my beautiful black Aztek with tons of options.  I got the 1SC option package with the towing package.  Those were pretty much my only options, but trust me that's twice as much as I was going to get in anything else.  Those 2 packages alone included power everything, cruise, keyless entry, Onstar, dual zone climate control, rear air compressor, cargo tray, auto lights and wipers, power driver's seat, steering wheel audio controls and too much else to possibly list.  My total came to $22,467 plus TT+L, about the same as the Rodeo that came with nothing and to top it off I got 4 years at 1.9%.

Ok I know that was really long, but I had to give you the full effect.  Now if you give this car a chance, take it for a test drive, compare it with others in it's class, you'll see, It's simply the best out there!
