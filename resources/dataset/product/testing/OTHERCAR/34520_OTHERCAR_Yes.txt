            I bought my Chevy Venture in June of 2002 at about 68,000 miles.  It now has over 72,000 so I cannot speak from long term experience.  I bought it mainly because I got a good deal on it, it looked good, and I liked the seating configuration.  It is roomy up front and doesn&#146t feel too bad in the second row either.  The third row is a little cramped.  My particular van has split bench seats in the second and third row.  The back of the 2nd and 3rd row seats can be laid flat or the whole seat can be flipped up on its end to provide storage space.    My bicycle fits nicely into the middle section with the seats tilted up.  The 2nd and 3rd row seats can also be removed.   The engine is powerful and will keep up well on the interstate with little effort.  The engine noise is minimal but there is some road noise with the General tires that are on it. There are many automatic features on the Venture which you may or may not like.  For instance when you put it in drive all the doors automatically lock.  They all open when you turn off the ignition.  The headlights come on automatically and can sense when it is dark outside.  The interior lights seem to know when you need them and automatically come on when you enter the car up until the time you start it and also come on when you turn the motor off.   Another feature is a delayed lock.  If the door is open and you use the power door lock it waits for about five seconds before locking just to make sure you didn&#146t leave the keys in the car.  I wouldn&#146t say that it drives like a car because  it sits higher than a car and feels more bulky, but the vehicle is easy to maneuver and shouldn&#146t be a problem for car owners making the switch to a van.

Here are some of the negative things about the van.  The van sways and bounces a little almost to the point of making you feel car sick.  The ride, at least on my van, is a little rough.  I do not know the source.  It could be tires or something else.    I have had several other problems under the hood.  When I bought the van I noticed that there were some oil leaks and that there was no water in the radiator recovery tank.  The tire store mechanic that I used said it had some oil leaks but didn&#146t seemed concerned about the empty recovery tank.  The day after I bought the van we headed up to  Pennsylvania on vacation where I noticed that the water in the recovery tank kept going away.  I had it checked out when I got home and found the van had a lower intake manifold gasket leak.  The repair cost me $755 and the  Chevy mechanic said it had been leaking for quite a while both externally and internally (coolant was in the oil).  They replaced the manifold gasket, valve cover gaskets, and did an oil change.  About two weeks later I started noticing coolant under the car and took it back to the dealer.  They found that the water pump was bad and replaced it for another $234.    Also on vacation I started hearing a clicking sound and an occasional knocking sound in the motor which would go away after the motor warmed up.   It is very faint since the repairs so I&#146m hoping the clean oil has taken care of it.   Further reading and research on this van and the 3.4 V6 motor (especially from www.minivanreview.com) enlightened me that the intake manifold gasket has been a problem on this motor around 40-60 thousand miles as well as the click in the motor.  Also we would get a little vibration on the trip at times, almost like a rough road or a tire out of balance.  I still don&#146t know what that is.  Water leaks onto the floor of the driver&#146s side.  I suspect some kind of rain leak since the AC appears to be draining okay.  The  motor in this van is packed in so that the back valve cover and spark plugs are under the extended window and dash.  Expect larger than normal labor charges on tune ups and anything else involving the part of the engine under the dash.   The plastic accessories can be easily broken.  A lid on a little storage space in the back broke just from leaning on it.  It will cost about $50 to replace.  Also one  of the headlight lens is very hazy and will probably need to be replaced.

If I had to do it over again I would not get the van knowing what I know now.  I take some comfort in that the initial cost was relatively low and even with repairs I think I paid less than what I would have paid for equivalent imports.  When everything is working it can be fun to drive and convenient for hauling cargo.  Read the minivan magazine website and Consumer Reports for further insight, comments, and problems that others have had.   I would highly recommend that anyone looking at the Chevy Venture, Olds Silhouette, or Pontiac Montana  have it thoroughly checked out by a dealer with special attention given to the engine intake manifold gaskets.  Check the oil for a milkshake like substance (coolant in the oil), listen for a tick or knock, look in the radiator and overflow tank and see if you can see coolant.  Check to see if there is a dirt-like substance around the radiator cap.  This may indicate someone has been dumping stop leak additives in the radiator.  Check the floor mats for water and thoroughly check all power equipment.  I  had a visual inspection done  by a tire dealership and he obviously missed some things.    Also buy from a reputable dealer and try to get a warranty.   I trust this is helpful.

Here is a follow up on the van at 100,000 miles.

My 97 short version Venture just passed 100K on a 2000+ mile round trip from FL to PA and the van performed very well. Yes I had the gasket problem about 30,000 miles ago but I got it fixed and moved on. The gasket and a water pump have been the only major expenses that I have had since I have owned it. I've found the much criticized 3.4 at least quick and powerful and it kept up with traffic well both in the mountains and on flat land. The electronics, transmission, and accessories are still working well and the ride is acceptable, though I do get some bounce and sway and a good amount of road noise. The water on the floor turned out to be a missing L shaped drain attachment from the external AC drainage tube. New tires helped smooth out the ride. I did have some starting problems and had to get the battery replaced twice (1st AC Delco battery went bad in about a week). Since then though it has been a good starter, even in the cold north. I still like the roominess and the different seat configurations. We had 3 adults, a 16 year old daughter, a dog, and lots of luggage on this last trip. It will be interesting to see how these older vans with 100K+ hold up. I honestly don't know if I can still enthusiastically endorse these vans but mine has turned out to be fairly reliable and I know several other owners who are quite happy with theirs. Consumers Report has upgraded the 97 short version to average reliability and has taken it off the "used cars to avoid" list. I feel extremely blessed so far. Be sure and keep up the the maintenance.
