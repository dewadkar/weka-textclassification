            Saw this Olympus D520 on clearance at Office Depot about a month ago and couldn't pass up such a good deal.  The D520 is a 2 mega pixel digital with X3 optical zoom and has received excellent reviews around the net.  Got this baby home and read the manual for a good 10 minutes and I was ready to make digital photo history.  It came with a 16 MB smartmedia card which holds about 30 high resolution pics.  Simple point and shoot with wide angle and telephone controls on top of the camera next to shutter release button (very convenient).  Open the front cover to turn on the camera and the lens extends out ready for use.  Probably shot about 100 pics with and without flash that day.  Battery life was better than expected as the original batteries (2 AA's) are still working after 300 shots!!! 

Very impressed with the camera and features.  The D520 has the cool X3 optical zoom which provides a good quality pic.  Other cool features are the panoramic mode (to be used only with Olympus smartmedia and included software), macro mode for those close up shots, and the 2 in 1 feature to place two photos on the same frame (for the before and after shot).  Overall quality of photos were good at 5x7 print size but tends to become grainy at larger sizes.  More than adequate quality for emailing photos and website pics.

Less impressive was the delay between flash photos.  Seems like a long waiting time for the flash to charge (~5 - 8 seconds?).  Found out also that the brand of smartmedia card may effect the camera use also.  Went out and bought a 128MB Samsung card and formatted in the camera as instructed.  Whenever I removed the card and then reinserted later, I would get a card error message.  However, this didn't seem to effect taking more shots or any loss of data.  Read on the net later that others had similar probs but no loss of pictures noted.  

Overall, this is a great starter digital camera with features that can develop along with you and your digital skill...gotta love it!!!
