            Having a 1990 Infiniti M30 as my first car at the age of 16, I must say that I am extremely spoiled.  I got this car from my dad's secretary, who was hesitant to sell it to us because of the car being ten years old.  For the price she was offering, slightly under Blue Book value, it was a deal that my dad and I knew we couldn't afford to pass up.  What do I love about this vehicle?  Heh, what's not to love?  The handling and power of the engine make this car extremely fun to drive.  That combined with smooth ride make this car what it is, a true luxury sports car.  The only problem I have had (honestly, the only problem) is that occasionally two of my speakers crackle.  But when they work, the individually amplified Bose speakers and sound system deliver high quality sound from classical to alternative.  The only problem I feel now is that I have adopted a new driving standard: once an Infiniti, always an Infiniti.  That could be tough standard to hold!  It's a shame that Infiniti only made the M30 for three years.<br><br>
