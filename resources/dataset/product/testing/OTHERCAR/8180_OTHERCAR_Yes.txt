            When I was looking for a new car, I wanted something really nice, but didn't want to have to pay a fortune.  I ended up getting an Audi A4 1.8T, manual transmission with Sports and Celebration packages.  Here's some comparisons I made while shopping..

<b>Audi vs. Volvo S60</b>: Audi was faster, cheaper and had better handling.

Audi vs. BMW 325: Audi was much cheaper, and -almost- as nice of a drive.  Pay attention: the BMW did drive slightly better and have better acceleration, but it wasn't enough for me to justify the extra $7000 or so to buy a similarly-equipped 325.

FWD vs. Quattro:  I didn't like the four-wheel drive Quattro version.  Although it stuck to the road extremely well, it felt sluggish.

4 cylinder vs. V6 engine:  I preferred the feel of the 1.8T engine.  Although it feels under-powered starting out, as soon as the RPM gage hits 2000 the 1.8T really takes off.  The V6 engine has more even power, but didn't seem to have as much "punch".
