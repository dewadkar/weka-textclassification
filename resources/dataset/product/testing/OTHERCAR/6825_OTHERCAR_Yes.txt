                I took a road trip to New York with a bunch of friends of mine, and the car we eventually decided to use was the Subaru Impreza.  Why?

   A. Our other choices were a 15 year old truck that shot flames from the tailpipe, My Jeep, and a minivan

   B.  The Subaru is a reliable, fun car.

    The Subaru I'm reviewing is a 4 door sedan with AWD.  I really like this car, it's a great one to have around.  It easily gets 30+ MPG highway driving and high 20's city.  It has a little bit of pep, but not a whole lot.  It's very safe to drive, because it's so very reliable (they've had it for 2 years and they had to change a headlight once) and it's got ABS and All Wheel Drive.  I love AWD, you CAN'T lose traction, it seems. (course, this means you can't do a burn out either....)  It's quiet, and roomy in front and back.  There are no squeaks from the body and the engine is almost silent.  It has power everything, and the stereo system is very competent, although it's nothing to write home about.  It was a great car to make a longtrip in, because it's so fun to drive and it's very comfortable.  It's no exactly SPORTY per se, but it hugs the road great and had no trouble blowing the doors off some stupid guy who cut us off on the highway in a Cherokee.  My Escort can still beat it though....
   
     All in all, Subarus as a rule are a little more expensive both used and new, but they're almost always worth it.  This car has been a rock solid performer, and is comfortable and reliable enough to be a primary car for anyone.  <br><br>
