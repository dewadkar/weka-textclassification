            First off, if you have 12,000-20,000 to buy on a sports car, GO OUT RIGHT NOW AND BUY THIS CAR!!  I AM SERIOUS!  This is a perfect blend of style, speed, handling, sportiness, and BARGAIN!!

In 1992, Porsche unvieled the 968 line, the evolved for of the 944 series. 
This car is downright beautiful, but still didn't sell well.  Enthusiast never really liked the fact that it had a 4 cylinder engine, and never gave it a chance.  However, this is the most powerful 4 cylinder ever made, and can rack up 200+ horsepower, and get this car running over 150mph.  

This is also one of the best handling cars ever produced by Porsche.  The weight distribution is 50/50, so the car is a technical masterpiece.  It is not uncommon to see this car win autocrosses with its superb turning abilities.  It's also a head turner, and an attention getter.  

This car is probably the best deal in sports cars.  You can own an 8 year old Porsche in great condition for about 15,000.  

The only negative I can think of is trunk space.  But then again, you wouldn't buy this car to haul things anyway, you want it because of its great looks, and because it's an affordable PORSCHE!!  THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE!!<br><br>
