            I love my Sony Digital Camera.  The only problem was when I decided to print my pictures.  I started with the printing program that came along with the camera.  It wasn't that difficult to use, I also went to Sam's Club to buy Kodak glossy ink jet paper (which does make a great difference), but the pictures still came out blurry.  The picture quality is great when you are sending them over the e-mail, or adding to a web site, but I have had my camera for 3 months now, I have gone through another printing program and I still have the same picture quality.  

The best thing I can recommend at this point is to really shop around and go to the Sony web page for more information.  

The next thing I can recommend is if you have just bought one of the Sony cameras with the 3x5 disk, is that if you are going to an event which requires you change out disks in a hurry, like a wedding etc., format your discs before the event starts.  
I went to a wedding, taking picture after picture, was about to take a picture of &quot;the kiss&quot; and I ran out of disk space.  I hurried and tried to get the next disk into the camera, and I would have had enough time, but the disk wasn't formatted, and I missed the kiss!  

The camera has been very handy though, and I can't wait to take it on more vacations and weddings.<br><br>
