            Honestly I bought this car because it was cute, it was affordable, it was almost new and it had a decent sound system.  I still remember blasting &quot;No scrubs&quot; when I went for the first test drive in it, and my mom had to drive because I couldn't drive stick.  I HAD to have a standard.  I get too bored with automatics. This car has an okay shifter, but its kind of difficult at first.  Kind of unsmooth.  Also I hate how you have to floor it to get any kind of quick pickup and its LOUD!  Well its definitely not a sports or luxury car.  Hey, you get what you pay for. Okay lets see i love the interior.  I love the seats.  Firm and ergonomic.  I love the smooth look of the front panel and tiny steering wheel.  Whats weird is alot of things about this car are tiny: the engine, the tires, the overall look of the car...yet the backseat and the trunk are roomy and spacious.  I am always mesmerized by how they distributed the space and the dimensions in that tiny car and came up with an interior as big as a normal car.  The engine is only four cylinder, which is sucky if you ask me.  Like I said, this is no sports car.  If you want a sports car get a sports car.  Bottom line...its cute, reliable, and you can afford it even if you make minimum wage.    <br><br>
