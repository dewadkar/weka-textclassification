            I purchased a 1996 Mercury Sable GS in December of 1998.  I LOVE this car!  It is a very handsome automobile.  And it has all the wonderful luxury options of an extremely expensive automobile, without the expensive price tag of one.  The car rides like a dream.  Purchasing it used, I paid around half the price of a brand new Sable.  I have owned the car for over a year now, and have had no problems what-so-ever.  When I can bear to part with my wonderful Sable sometime down the road, my next purchase will definitely be another Mercury Sable.  <br><br>
