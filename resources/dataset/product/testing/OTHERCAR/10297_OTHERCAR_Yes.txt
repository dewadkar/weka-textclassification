            This camera was a gift from a friend who knew I needed a digital camera to do a small project for him.

It's definitely NOT a professional grade or serious hobbyist's model, but for those "look what the kids are doing" candids, it's a good deal.

My four year old takes pretty good pictures with it (one out every four shots is usable) and she is learning to love photography at an early age.

It has only built in memory and you have to use a USB cable to transfer photos.

It holds about 65 photos and also records short "flip-book" quality videos with no sound.  Its infinite focus lens does a fair job of getting a clear image, but some shots, especially lower light, will be blurry.

The main drawback for us is that the unit powers itself off in 60 seconds.  If you are waiting for a shot, invariably you hear the "beep-beep" of the camera going to sleep right before the event you awaited.  Take "throwaway" shots every 45 seconds or so to keep it awake.

The auto-off would not be such a big deal except the camera sets itself back to default on shutdown.  If you have set the flash and the exposure settings, they're gone with a "beep-beep".

Also the mode and select buttons beep every time you press them.  Not ideal for a quiet environment.
