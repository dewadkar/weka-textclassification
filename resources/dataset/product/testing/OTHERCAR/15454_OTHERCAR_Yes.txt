            I have owned this camera for about 6 months now, and have enjoyed every minute of its use.  It features a 16X precision digital zoom, 1.3 Mega Pixels, 1280 X 960 Image size, an Audio-Video out plug and cable for viewing live or saved data on any television equipped with the usual a-v inputs.  The general battery life is up to 2 hours with the supplied NP-F330 battery pack.  Supplied accessories include the power cord for the battery charger, a-v connecting cable, shoulder strap, and stringed lens cap. Having the lens cap attached to the camera by a string has saved me many times from loosing the cap - especially when I am out doors and shooting action pictures.  The biggest reason for me to have bought this camera was for saving single pictures or movies on a 2HD 1.44MB diskette! I can save about 28-35 pictures on each diskette, or one movie with audio in length of about 1.5 minutes.  I highly recommend this camera, especially for the individual purchasing a digital camera for the first time!<br><br>
