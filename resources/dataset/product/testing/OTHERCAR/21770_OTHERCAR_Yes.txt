            The Good:

The Honda Civic is what all cars should aspire to be. It's affordable and is still attractive enough to be seen in public. It comes with enough standard equipment to be comfortable, if not luxurious. I especially appreciate the adjustable steering wheel. The seating has a lot of flexibility, which is great for the shorter people on Earth (ie., 4'11''). The 'cockpit' is well laid out and user friendly. The cup holders are a great plus. The ride is smooth and comfortable. The body has a solid, heavy feel. I've already been over 60,000 miles in two years and everything is still groovy (knock on wood). I hear they have a great re-sale value, but I hope to not have to find that out any time soon. The only services I've needed on the car are oil changes/tune ups, recalls (all minor), and one tire change.

The Bad:
The only real down side to the Civic is the glass. In rain (or even just damp weather) the windows and windshield fog up more than with any other car I've owned (which is a fair number). The defogger/defrost works well, but must stay on to be effective. This makes it a little uncomfortable in really cold weather when you'd rather have heat on you than on the windshield. Another point: the standard line does not include a light for the trunk, which can be really annoying. If you're a larger person, you might find it a bit difficult to fit in. The seats are very adjustable, but remember that it is a 'compact' car. All in all, the 'bads' are pretty minor.<br><br>
