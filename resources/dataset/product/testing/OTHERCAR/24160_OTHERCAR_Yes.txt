                 I was in the market for a car recently since my poor 1988 Oldsmobile seemed to be on it's last leg.  I'm not particularly knowledgeable when it comes to cars, but I knew what I wanted - a car that was good looking, dependable, and on the relatively cheap side.  I was not in the market for a BRAND new car, but while searching the internet for cars, the Hyundai Elantra GLS caught my eye.  I suppose the price is what I noticed first.  But when I started researching this car, it started sounding better and better, so I had to go for a test drive and see for myself.  
     The Hyundai Elantra GLS comes with many good standard features - driver's and front passenger airbags and side-impact airbags, air conditioning, power windows and door locks, driver's multi-adjustable seat with lumbar support, childproof rear door locks, am/fm cassette, etc.  It also has a 60/40 split fold-down rear seatback, which has already proven quite useful.  This car's standard drivetrain is manual (5-speed), but you will have no trouble finding it in Automatic (I can't drive 5-speed).  The EPA mileage estimates are 24 city/33 highway for both automatic and manual (14.5 gallon fuel capacity).
     The Elantra comes with a 5 year/60,000 mile bumper to bumper and 10 year/100,000 mile powertrain warranty, and 5 year unlimited miles 24 hr. roadside assistance.  
     Now I'll tell you about my experience with this car.  I absolutely love it!  It could possibly be the fact that I've never owned a brand new car, but I am thrilled.  I got an optional package with mine that included cruise control, keyless remote entry with alarm, and an anti-lock braking system w/ traction control.  There are many other optional features you can choose from, which I didn't get because I felt I didn't need them.  The car is very sleek and attractive, and comes in 9 colors (mine is Chianti Red).  I love the roomy feeling inside even though it's a compact car.  It drives very nicely, although it feels like it could probably use a little more power (engine is 4cylinder 2.0L).  I've discovered that the resale value for this car is not very good, but I intend to have this car for a very long time, so it doesn't concern me.  The price I paid for this car was $14,100 approx., but I also got a $1500 rebate.  Keep an eye out for the special rebates and percentage rates, they come out every so often.  
     All in all, I felt I got a great car at a great price, and I look forward to driving my Hyundai Elantra for years to come.
