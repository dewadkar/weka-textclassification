            Having owned many Porsches the ultimate is obviously the 911tt. This car makes you feel good every time you see it. The unmistakable sound makes your senses go wild. You can drive it tame or unleash the whirlwind! It still remains the fastest production car from 0-60 on the road, the turbo S is a tenth of a second faster, but few were made. This car is wonderfully stable at high speeds and it sticks to the road like glue in the rain. There are very few drivers who challenge at red lights and most who do have no reason. Corvette ZR1s, Vipers and strangely a few Mustang owners find out quickly that turbos are not to be tangled with. Having said that, the Porsche cost considerably more and you get a great deal more. I have had my turbo beyond 180 mph and I never felt unsafe. Having owned a Corvette I can tell you I would not even get close to that point. I do not mean to insult or demean Vette owners, they are truly an American icon. I can promise you that the money spent on a turbo is worth it. I look forward to driving it every chance I have. Mechanically it is perfect no problems at all. Gas mileage is weak if you have a heavy foot, but why are you buying one in the first place. The digital sound system is great and everything is power on the car. It is truly an incredible performance car, one that I am fortunate to drive.
Lastly, the car is appreciating. Currently as of 4-00, they are selling from 108,000-114,000 depending on mileage, color, options and condition.
They are the last of a breed and do not be surprised if the new 2001 turbo has the same performance specs. <br><br>
