            We bought our Intrepid new.  It developed a power steering issue within the first couple months and needed to be repaired, but have not had a problem since.

The car (with the 3.5 liter &quot;Sport&quot; engine) is very peppy and the interior is very comfortable, but a little noisy.  The trim is mostly plastic so if that is bothersome, you my look elsewhere because everything in the cabin is plastic - with a little fabric here-and-there.

Not too many rattles or shakes at all yet.  We've had a minor problem with the driver's seat being a little &quot;lose&quot; to which the dealer responded, &quot;Oh, that's the way it's designed&quot; - whatever, not too big a deal.

Gas mileage is good - mid-twenties to lower thirties on highway.  Lots of space in the trunk and inside cabin - very good sized car for families.  We fit two car seats and one adult in the back seat (a little tight for the adult, but not really that bad).  Leg room in the back is very good with just adequate head-room.

The styling is very nice and the paint job seems to be holding up very well to the standard wear-and-tear of children.  Very satisfied and don't regret purchasing at all.<br><br>
