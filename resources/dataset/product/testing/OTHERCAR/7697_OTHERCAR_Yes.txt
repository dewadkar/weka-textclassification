            After having owned several Ford SUV's since 1993, I decided that it was time for a change. Since 1996, I have owned a V8 Explorer, a 1997 Expedition, and a 1998 Expedition. The 96 Explorer had an ongoing rattle in the front end on hard right turns. Despite repeated trips in to the shop, the problem never got resolved. The dealer realized what a problem this was and worked out a trade on a 1997 Expedition. That, too, was a problem vehicle. Almost from Day 1, it produced a drive line vibration that could be felt throughout the entire vehicle. This occurred at speeds from 62 to 70 mph. This required many trips to the shop with about 45 days of use lost. The dealer and I negotiated a trade for a 98 Expedition. It wasn't neccesarily a buy back but may have been more to my advantage. The 98 was just alright and my wife wasn't terribly comfortable in the seats. 
It was then that I decided that since I had been interested in the Tahoe since it came out in 1995 that I would get one. I do not regret this decision. The Tahoe has not been perfect but with the couple of problems I've had I'm still happy with it. The first problem I had started at about 12,000 miles. The car intermittently would blow the engine management control fuse. This required three trips in to the shop. One trip in was on the back of a tow truck and the last trip in had the car down for almost two weeks. The dealer was excellent and stuck with it until they found the problem. The problem turned out to be overheated wires in the fuel pump that would rub together when they got hot and short the fuse. What helped besides the dealer's determination was that they provided me with a loaner vehicle. This was well appreciated since I didn't even by the car from them. Should I get another Tahoe, which is highly likely, I will buy from that dealer.
The second problem I had was that the front brake rotors warped at about 21,000 miles which required that they be machined. This was done under warranty. I elected to have the brake pads replaced at my expense although they had approximately 50% remaining.
At the same time, I experienced a problem with a clunk from the driveline  on moderate acceleration. This, also, was repaired under warranty. The dealer installed a new type of fluid in the transfer case to eliminate the slip yoke from binding up.
While the 1999 and earlier Tahoe may not have the technical advances like multi point fuel injection and rear disc brakes like the Expedition, they are more powerful, smoother, and get better gas mileage. The Vortec engine runs stronger, more smoothly, and more quietly than the Ford Triton V8. The year 2000 model Tahoe is equipped with multi-point fuel injection, four wheel disc brakes, and five link coil sprung rear suspension putting it more on a par with the Expedition. 
The Tahoe also seems to handle more nimbly than the Expedition. It also does not exhibit the body roll that the Expedition did on moderately hard turns.
The four speed overdrive automatic in the Tahoe shifts better and smoother than the Expedition's transmission. The Expedition seemed to drag between gears.
