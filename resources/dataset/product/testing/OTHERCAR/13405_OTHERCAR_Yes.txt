            I bought the 96 Blazer 4 Dr 4WD LT (the top of the line model) when it was brand new.  It seemed like a good buy, a few thousand less than its competitors and more or less the same features.

In the test drive before the purchase, it performed well (as most test drives do).  After the purchase, in actual driving conditions it performed not so well.  The Vortec V6, while producing 195hp did not seem up to snuff, especially on inclined roads (if you've ever been in San Francisco, you know what I mean) and seemed very heavy and sluggish.  Steering and handling performance were also sluggish and did not seem very responsive, even for an SUV.  Braking distance is also quite long even with ABS.  In fact, I have received recall notices for the Blazer at least twice because of braking problems.  The 4-speed automatic transmission, while good for city driving, is not well suited for the sluggish V6 on the highway unless going past legal speed limits.  It is especially noticeable when driving on highways with some incline.  The 5-speed manual would be a better choice but is not available on the LT model and only available on the LS 2 Dr base model.

On the plus side, it has an all leather interior including the steering wheel, a nice 6 speaker stereo with in dash CD player, power seats, power windows, power locks, power mirrors.  The A/C does its job adequately although not in extremely hot weather like in Las Vegas.  There is an overhead console that displays the outside temp (Fahrenheit and Celsius) as well as a digital compass while holding your sunglasses and other small items at the same time.  Neat feature.  There is ample room for 4 adults and adequate room for 5.  It would be nice to have rear headrests though.  Trunk space is quite good and can store enough for most needs.

Overall, it is a good ride but the handling, engine power and braking might be too sluggish and unresponsive to some.  There is a V8 option in later models and I'd highly suggest spending more for that option as well as opting for the 5-speed manual rather than the 4-speed automatic if possible.<br><br>
