            The 4-Runner is a great vehicle.  I own a 1995, and am looking forward to purchasing the 2000 later this year.  With over 50,000 miles, this vehicle has never needed service other than routine maintenance.

I bought a 4-Runner because of the renovation work I was doing on my home (my Celica wasn't big enough to bring home 4x8 sheets of drywall).  The back cargo bed is roomy, and can easily be made even bigger by folding down the back seats.  

When I made the purchase, I test drove several other vehicles, including a Jeep Grand Cherokee, but liked the handling and feel of the 4-Runner best (and the 1999 model I test drove last year handles better, and gives a smoother ride than my 1995).  I've never been disappointed with the handling of this vehicle, and rarely feel like it is going to tip over, despite the height.  Although a bit heavy (5000+ lbs curb weight), the extra weight combined with 4WD means this truck can go just about anywhere without getting stuck, and that under normal driving conditions, it is hard to roll, despite its 9&quot; clearance.  The weight, however, does contribute to mediocre gas mileage, despite a somewhat underpowered 6-cylinder engine (the '99 model I test drove gets better gas mileage despite having an engine with improved HP).

The rear door on the older models was also unique, as the window retracts down into the door which then folds down (unlike most SUVs where the rear door folds up).  This is a great feature for the vertically challenged, but something that Toyota had changed on the 1999 model I test drove last year.  And if you are vertically challenged, running boards will be a must, as this is one of the taller vehicles on the market.

The worst thing about the '95 model was that the Anti-Lock brakes were front wheel only, and the ABS system disengaged when you went into 4WD (the '99 model that I test drove had 4WD and 4-wheel ABS, so this is no longer a problem). As a result of 2-wheel ABS in the '95 model, you are 
forced to pick between traction and braking in icy conditions.  Because of this choice, I slid my 4-Runner into a vehicle stuck on an ice covered road when I tried to brake.  No one was injured and my 4-runner sustained a lot less damage than the Buick that I hit.

The other drawback to the 4-runner is its towing capacity; it is capable of towing, but only limited weight, so if you regularly tow a boat or camper, you should look at the specs real carefully before you make a decision.

Net, if you are looking for a tough, rugged, dependable vehicle then you should look at a 4-runner.
