            Mazda has always been about technology.  The Rotary RX cars of the 70's and 80's are proof.  They continue this theme with the Mazda Millenia S. What does the &quot;S&quot; stand for?  Who knows, maybe supercharged ,or sport or sporty or maybe silky. Drive the Millenia S, and it may stand for SOLD !

The Millenia S is a great car. It's not perfect, but it is very very good.
I'm not sure what separates a luxury car from a NEAR luxury car, but the Millenia seems pretty luxurious to me.

I was privileged enough to have the &quot;Millenium Edition&quot; Millenia which includes things like a 6-disc, in dash CD changer, driving lights, suede upholstery, 17 inch chrome wheels, and climate control.  Belive me - that is only a fraction of the standard features.

Inside the Millenia feels, looks and smells like a luxury car.  Seats are comfortable and yet retain a sporty feel.  Gauges are big and easy to read. Switchgear placement is OK, Nissan and Mazda both put the cruise control on/off switch on the dash while others mount it on the steering wheel with the other cruise functions.  It's not bad, just different. All the buttons and switches have a quality feel to them. A nice touch is the dual defrost/defog buttons.  There is a single button to press if your front or rear window is foggy - kinda cool. The automatic tilt steering wheel is really nice.  As soon as you remove the key from the ignition, the steering wheel tilts up for you so as to ease the getting in and out process.  Upon re-entry the steering wheel automatically moves back to the driving position (however you had it set). The stereo sounds good, but lacks bass, I had to turn the bass all the way up to achieve what I thought was normal. Speaking of the stereo, a 6 disc CD changer is always nice, but it's even nicer if you can load all 6 CD's from the drivers seat. I don't know where they all go, but it works. Rear seats are fine for adults unless you're 6 feet tall or over, then it's a bit crowded. Also, the rear seats do not fold down like most cars in it's class - there is a pass through compartment. Cup holders (we all love cup holders)are a little awkward to use.  The center console/armrest is big and will easily hold 7 CD's, a wallet and sunglasses.

Under the hood of the Millenia S is the much raved about 2.3L Miller Cycle V-6. The simplest way to describe the Miller Cycle engine is to say that it gives as much or more power (210hp) than a larger V-6, while still maintaining decent fuel economy (Mazda says 20 city 28 highway).  This is achieved by shortening the compression stroke which gives the engine a low compression ratio, yet a high expansion ratio. Enough science - it's just plain fast.  The engine and the car's straight line performance reminded me of the Pontiac/Buick supercharged V-6's, only a lot smoother. And I mean smooth. Smoother than a Dairy Queen cone on a hot July Saturday. The automatic shifts up and down without any jerking or harshness. 

Handling is predictable, but perhaps a little soft.  Compared to the Camry, the Millenia's handling is downright sporty. The car seems as if it where purpose built for road trips. I don't think I can say &quot;smooth and quiet&quot; enough.

Overall the Mazda Millenia looks great and has the performance to match.  With &quot;S&quot; model you get a lot of features as standard equipment, but expect to pay close to $30K.  However a Camry XLE with a V-6 and leather will also bring you close to $30,000  and you will not get 17 inch wheels, climate control, driving lights, or a 6 CD changer.  It's all about value.

Plus, when driving a Millenia, no one will ever mistake you for a tourist in a rental car... unlike some other Japanese 4-door imports.<br><br>
