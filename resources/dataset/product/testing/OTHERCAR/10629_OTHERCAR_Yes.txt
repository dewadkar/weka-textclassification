            We purchased a Daewoo Leganza in August 2000 and so far I love it. The interior is beautiful. Daewoo makes it possible to have the interior of a luxury car for the price of an economy car. The ride is not as smooth as a more expensive auto but better then some that I have been in. We also own a Saturn SL2 and this is by far a better quality automobile. The MPG on our car is anywhere from 22 to 26. This is both in town and freeway driving. 
The only problem we have noticed so far is that when the engine is cold, it takes a few minutes for it to shift gears. I'm hoping that this is not a problem that gets progressively worse. It seems to take a little longer every time, however, the weather keeps getting colder and colder. We didn't have any of these problems in the summer and I do think its just the cold engine causing it. I'm not too concerned because we were able to purchase a bumper to bumper 5 year or 75,000 mile warranty at the time of purchase.
The interior, unlike the Saturn, seats four comfortably with plenty of leg space in back.
To this day I would highly recommend the Leganza as an economical vehicle with alot of style for the price.<br><br>
