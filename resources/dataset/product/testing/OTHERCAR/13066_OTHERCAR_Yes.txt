            I was looking for an SUV and reluctant to spend over $35,000 so I decided on the Trooper.  It has been a little over 8 months and overall I am very pleased with it.  It performs well and hasn't had any major issues except for the muffler.  I have had it replaced 3 times since buying it earlier this year and the dealer doesn't have an explanation for the noise it makes.  Other than that I have been very pleased with it's performance and would seriously consider buying another one as my next SUV.  
I first came from a small car and moving up to an SUV was great. I really liked the great visibility that you get with the Trooper - you really can see everything when riding in it.  And the ground clearance is awesome too! I used to get stuck in snow with my other car and now I just put it in 4 wheel drive and I plow right through it! Truly great control! My Trooper has optional 4 wheel drive which is wonderful for heavy snow or heavy rain - much nicer than all time 4 wheel drive in my opinion since I don't compromise the gas mileage when I don't need to use 4 wheel drive. I would encourage anyone interested in an SUV to consider the Trooper!
