            Who would have though such a big car could be fun to drive?  My mom purchased her 1999 GLS and has since put on 30k problem free miles.

The engine is very responsive in the GLS. The 3.5 +200 hp engine is based on the northstar two cylinders less - the &quot;baby&quot; star.  While not a car to pull up next to a Camaro and start reving, the Intrigue will still provide much joy when acceleration is needed... or wanted.

Handling and ride are superb.  It takes no effort to move the wheel, and the car gives you a great feel of total control over it.  The ride is very smooth, while stil being sporty.

My mom opted for the works: Leather, 8 speaker BOSE stereo.  The bose system is great, and will handle your musical craving.  Only true audiphiles would demand more pricey aftermarket systems.

The power controlled leather seats can be positioned many ways to your liking.  They're big and comfy, and the back seat is roomy and comfy for adults as well!  The trunk is plenty big for anything as well.

All in all, i'd say this is a great car for adults who want an amazing handling, luxury/performance sedan that'll get the job done.
