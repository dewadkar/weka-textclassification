            It actually saddens me to write this.  A few years ago I traded my CRX in for a new ACURA Integra.  Thinking I was going to be getting the car of my dreams.  Don't get me wrong, the Integra is a good car, but it doesn't warm my heart the way my CRX did.  I actually plan to purchase another CRX soon.

This car has so many great things about it, I'm not sure where to start.  First off you can fit it anywhere!  I was always amazed how many spots this thing would fit in.  You can also fit just about anything in it.  The trunk opens like a clam shell and with the help of a bungee cord you are all set to move just about anything.  It's small and takes little time to warm up or cool down as far as A/C and heat go.  It is a two-seater so you won't be taking any large families on cross country trips with this car.  I had good visibility in it and few blind spots.  You sit low to the ground and I had a good amount of headroom, and that's a rare thing with Japanese cars and being 6ft tall.  Fuel mileage was a dream, always over 30mpg even when I drove it hard in city.  The only things I had to replace were tires, clutch, timing belt, brake pads, and muffler, and hood.  It had over 160,000 miles when I turned it in.

The downsides were few.  Two seats, I was never asked to drive on Friday night.  No power windows or mirrors.  And it didn't feel like I had a lot to protect me in an accident.  I actually put this to the test when I rear ended a car on the freeway.  I hit a stopped car probably about 35 - 40 mph.  The entire front of the car absorbed the impact and crumpled the hood.  I walked away wondering how the only thing wrong with my car was a mangled hood.  Being as light as it is, did pose a problem with snow.  Instead of sinking in and getting traction it wanted to pretend it was a sled.  

All in all it was the best damn car I ever owned and I look forward to the day I own another.<br><br>
