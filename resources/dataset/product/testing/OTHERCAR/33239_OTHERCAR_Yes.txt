            <p>Unfortunately, I only got to drive this car for one week, due to financing problems, however, I did drive over 500 miles in this car.  My initial opinion was that the car was out of my league, in both price and handling, but the test drive was enough to convince me.&lt;/p&gt;
<p>The steering was smooth and responsive.  The break petal didn't take too much pressure to slow down (a pet peeve of mine).  The car definitely had the guts to get up to speed quickly, even when going up hill.  The car itself was a large enough size that I felt quite comfortable even among the larger vehicles on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
<p>The interior was wonderful.  The seats could have been a bit more comfortable, but it was acceptable.  Plenty of head room.  My son could easily get in and out of the back seat.  The controls were okay, except for the climate controls, which I found myself having to bend to get to while driving.  The stereo system was excellent and well positioned in the car.  I got great sound off of it, and I really enjoyed the Speed Volume Control feature, that increased the volume based on the speed of the car.&lt;/p&gt;
<p>The car handles pretty well.  Doesn't take the curves all that well, but at low speeds it handles great.  It has daytime running lamps, which I appreciate, as I often drive at dawn and dusk.  The dash lighting was great was well, being quite easy on the eyes.&lt;/p&gt; 
<p>The last point I want to bring up is gas mileage.  I got about 29 MPG, which I thought was pretty decent.  I believe this car has a 12.5 gallon tank.  It's definitely better than the gas mileage I get in the Hyundai I now drive.
