            This is somewhat a belated review.  However, it could be usefull for some of you that are considering a purchase of a used Intrigue.  

Background:

Purchased my 1998 intrigue, slightly used (1 yr. w/ 14k) from CarMax - for $16K.  Black, with most of the extra's (leather, sunroof, power, bose stereo, etc.)  I was looking for a 4door sedan, with a sporty feel, but had to be under $20K.  I like the looks of the intrigue.  I've had it for over a year, and have about 33K on it now.


Good Things:

- I'm an engineer, and I have pet peves about how car's interiors are designed.  Of cars that I have owned, or rented, this ranks top notch for interior design (i.e. dash, cupholders, arm rest, buttons, etc.)  Quality of everything might be lacking - but it looks good.
- Similarly, I feel like I made a steal, and got almost the feel of a $30K lexus, for 1/2 price - with leather seats, sunroof, etc.
- 6 cyl/200hp performs nice and smooth - it has power for 99% of your driving needs.  
- Cruise control - makes me happy
- CD/Stereo - above average ability and sound.
- 30K warranty came in handy (see below)

Bad Things:

- Some factory defects were annoying at first.  These included:  defective steering column, a/c fan noise, door trim, and faulty temp. probe.  However, these were all repaired under warranty - and no longer are a problem.  When they were happening - the car felt cheap..
- There is some cheapness of interior materials - esp. compared to higher end cars.  
- Road noise higher than desired.
- H/AC controls are confusing


Conclusion:

So far I am pleased.  As long as it can hold up for a few years - I feel that I made a great buy.  For driving experience, it holds up with a new Accord I had previously (which cost $6k more).  I'm not sure what will happen to the value of the car - with the ousting of the Old's line.  But, that may make this car even more of a bargain.
