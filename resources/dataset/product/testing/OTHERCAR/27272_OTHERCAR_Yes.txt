            Flying Firebirds.  This car can only be seen in my garage.  Mine has a 350 with No-fuel injection becuase it  has a 440 holley carb on it with straight pipes.  But this is little things.  Now if you want the fast one you have to pay 25,000 just to get the car, and then if you are not satisfied with the handling and the comfort, them you would like to get Lingenfelter add on which would cost yo another 40,000 dollars. But im sure this car would be well worth it.  Now mine has candy apple red paint with charcole interior, it also has the 350 with a 4sp manual tranny.  This car has a lot of balls in it and would definatlly leave the stock camaros and mustangs in the dust<br><br>
