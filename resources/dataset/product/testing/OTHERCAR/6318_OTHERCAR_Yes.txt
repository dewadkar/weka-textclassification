            first let me say how much i love the dodge avenger es,it's a 1996 and i can honestly say it's the only car i've driven for three years and still love driving it!!!!!! the only thing that went wrong on it was the a/c unit went bad and the front bushings, both under warranty.
the car gets around thirty miles to the gallon on the highway,and twenty six in the city,it has good pickup and very comfortable,i can drive it for hours,do opt for the leather power six way seat , i am six one and dont push the seat all the way back, the cd stereo sound great and the sunroof is a nice touch.it also has the home link system, which controls you garage door and home lighting,the es model has a 2.5 mitsubishi v/6 do not buy the dodge motor in the standard model,unless you dont care about keeping it for long, or getting on the highway.it's sporty fun to drive and a good buy,buying it used that is,22.500 is too much for that type of car,but used it's a steal!!!!!     yes i am forced to sell it ,i have a company car now,,,,,uugh an astro van.
if anyone is interested in buying a shiny red well kept 96 with 53000 on it and in  the boston area,feel free to call 781-209-8700  <br><br>
