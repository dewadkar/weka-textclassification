            So far I've had my '99 Cougar for three months, and I have to say that it's been a pleasant experience for the most part.  We needed a car with an automatic transmission so my wife would drive it.  After looking around at what was available in my price range, we decided that the Cougar was good fit.  It definitely has great looks.  If you like to be noticed, you should get this car, it definitely turns heads.  The interior is equally pleasing to the eye, and the seats are very comfortable.  The car handles very well, and also seems very solid with no rattles or squeaks.  The factory installed radio sounds really good.  

As for complaints, I have a couple.  The back seats are extremely tight.  I don't fit in them for one thing.  I'm 5'10&quot; tall, and my head hits the roof in the back.  My kids tell me that they're comfortable, but they haven't grown that much yet.  I'm sure it'll be a different story in two or three years.  The other complaint is acceleration.  This car just doesn't seem to accelerate as fast as I'd expect it to.  Granted, I have the automatic transmission, but it still can be a dog at times.  I've heard that some Cougars have that problem and there's a fix for it, so I'm taking mine in to be checked.

This car is currently my daily driver.  And since I'm alone most of the time, it fits its purpose well.  If only the back seat was larger for those times that I drive people to lunch.  Maybe they'll start driving now!<br><br>
