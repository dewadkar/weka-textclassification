            This is my second opinion on this car.  I am trying to write better ones.  I was new here when I wrote the first one, so I am starting from scratch.

This car, I had no problems with, just that it rated a 21 on the insurance safety scale which made my insurance sky high.  My loan was for $16,500 for this car, the cheapest one I could get my hands on at the time believe it or not, and I felt the price was up there.  There was no cassette or anything, but I had to get rid of the car I was trading in.

I never experienced any engine problems or any problems at all.  Although the car had no accessories with it, but it looked nice, and it was brand new.  It wasn't bad comfort wise and although it had no cassette or CD in it, the sound system wasn't bad.  The heating and air controls are easy to get to and operate.

This car shares it structure inside and out with the Toyota Corolla.  Actually, Toyota and General motors are in joint operation with each other.  I was kind of shocked when I read that because I thought they were competitors, but instead, they are both created in the same factory.

Now, I had the regular coupe, but the LSi is the one with the cassette, power door locks, power mirrors, power windows, and a 60/40 folding rear seat.  I didn't have the folding rear seat which I wish I would have had.
The regular Prizm coupe didn't have any of these things.  I had to crank down the window, crank it back up, reach over and unlock the passenger door, reach over and lock it.  Nothing would fit in my trunk because I couldn't fold down my seat, and my mirrors had to be adjusted manually. I wish I would have gotten the LSi, but I was so car illiterate, that I didn't know they existed.

Anyway, the car is a 1.8-liter, 120 horsepower, 4 cylinder engine, 4 valves per cylinder, and dual overhead cams.  The engine acts just like a big one.  This car can really go.  Tap on the gas peddle and you are gone gone gone.  That is what I liked so much about it was that you could tap the gas and you would go.  That car would run off the fumes when I was out of gas.

The car weighs 64 pounds less that the previous 1.8 liter, uses a serpentine belt for accessories, excellent throttle response because it is tuned to supply its pulling power at low engine speeds.
Mileage is very good too.

Now, in the winter time when the car gets cold, for the first few miles, the transmission will whine, but not a loud one.  That would be the loudest thing I would hear on that car, and that really wasn't too loud.

The exhaust emissions are improved from past models too.  The exhaust manifold sits closer to the catalytic converter which reduces emissions, and it meets California emission standards.  The car is 174.3 inches, sets on a 97 inch wheelbase.  It has dual front airbags, 3 point safety belts for all passengers, including a center belt in the back seat.  Although it has these safety specs, that still doesn't change the minds of the insurance companies on safety.  

I recommend this car to those who drive safely.  I would hate to hear of a person getting in a wreck in this car and being killed.  I don't know how many there have been, but State Farm told me that it is very easy for those cars to be totaled and those inside being injured severely.
