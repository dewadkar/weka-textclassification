            I made a mistake.  I went to europe and allowed myself to drive &quot;their cars&quot;.  Since I came back I am suddenly dissatisfied with &quot;our cars&quot;  As my english friend mentioned, &quot;we use to laugh at american movies where you see the actors constantly shifting the steering wheel back and forth while driving.  Then I drove one of &quot;your&quot; cars and realized it wasn't just bad acting&quot;.  Because of this experience, I became obcessed with a car that &quot;handles&quot;.  I found it, the Miata.  At a much more affordable price then comparable sports cars, the Miata is a hot little dream.  Make note: steering is so tight, you do not want to be fumbling around for stuff on your passenger seat.  Unintentional 5 lane changes will likely ensue.  This car is an absolute handling dream.  Responsive, quick off the mark (not that I would ever drive like that of course).  If you drive one your most immidiate priority in life will become searching your memory for the best &quot;twisty road&quot; you remember driving.  The upgraded engine for the '94 and newer models is the iceing on the proverbial cake.  Ok so the downside, you will want to take it on a road trip...how long can you vacation with luggage the size of an overnight case?  Although the space in the car is minimal, you will forget this factor in short order.  With the top down, wind in your hair and the unmistakable looks of envey you get from other motorists, you will have a simple desire to calculate how many miles you can pull off with what you have readily available in your bank account for gas.  Even on that consideration, a little will take you a long way.  For what you save on the value for money of the car and the gas expense, skip the overnight bag and buy what you need when you get there.  This is mid life crisis incarnate.  One thing to remember though, you actually have to drive this one.  Floating on the usual 9 to 5 commute won't due.....but then that is its charm. <br><br>
