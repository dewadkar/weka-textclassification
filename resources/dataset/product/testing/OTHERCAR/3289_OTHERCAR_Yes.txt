            This car has everything and more to make your driving experience an enjoyable one. I was in market for a new vehicle about 14 months ago and fell in love with this Mazda. I owned a 1989 323 mazda for a few years before the engine died after 130,000 miles. I did not want to spend $2000-$3000 for a rebuilt or new engine so I had to retire that baby. 

While shopping for a new car, I tried to keep an open mind. I thought about the Nissan Maxima, Honda Accord, Toyota Camry or the Mazda Millenia.  I thought about the Mazda 929, but quickly found out that they no longer made that car but it was replaced and upgraded to the millenia. After shopping for several weeks/months, I narrowed the search down to the Maxima and the Millenia due to the features I was looking for and how much I was willing to spend.

I rented a new 1998 Maxima for seven days so I could get a feel for the car and the features. It was the upper end of the Maxima. It ran like a charm and the pick-up on this car was great. Once my foot hit the acceleration it was ready to take off with a quickness. This vehicle costs somewhere in the ~$20,000's and has quite a few features that are standard.

I only test drove the Millenia a few times and talked to a lot of people about this car. I found that it had a many features that was standard on this car. A few of the features are sunroof, abs brakes, lower back lumbar support, fog lights, leather seats, power this power that (windows, mirror, seats). To upgrade the vehicle with what they called seasonal package was not that expensive and offered many things. The seasonal package included, heated seats, extra traction control for tires in snow and rain (TCS), the engine and battery is prepared and ready to endure the cold cold weather, just to name a few. The test drives were very pleasant and the car sounds like it's not even on. I live in the land of pot holes, Philadelphia, so not feeling those bumps and thumps was important to my next car purchase. This car drove like a champ over the bumps and it won my heart for that.

I liked the unique style of the car, inside and out. I felt and feel that the car stands out from the rest. It is a eye catcher and has the look and style of class written all over it. The features make you feel the luxury and thoughtfulness they put into creating this car. I also went with this car because it seems like everybody, or at least a great deal of people drive the Maxima and the Millenia is not seen crowding the roads. When you see a Maxima you don't even think twice but when you see a Millenia you turn you head and smile. 

The cons of this car is the single car holder on the arm rest. The passenger has to hold their cup in hand. The leg room in the rear is much to be desired. Besides those few things, I love my car and would purchase it again and again without question.

Just a little note about the service department. I had to take the car in for service because my michelin right tire kept losing air pressure. I took it to firestone and they could not find anything but at the Mazda dealership service department they found it had a nail in it. They took the car at the last minute in the morning and fixed it all up for me in no time flat and even washed and cleaned the car for me all at no charge. A few days later I received a questionaire from the main office because they got word that I took the car in for service. They wanted to make sure everything was working and running fine with my car. The service office also called the next day and asked how everything was going with the car and that also was a pleasant gesture. I was treated well and was very happy with the service and I love my vehicle. I would recommend taking the car for a spin.
