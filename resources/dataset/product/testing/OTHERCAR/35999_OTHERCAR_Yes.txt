            This is the car that I've been rolling in for a few years now and I'm telling you that it is one sweet SUV.  My dad originally bought it for $8,000 and I am buying it off him for $4,000.

Personally, mine is black (with tinted windows) and it's a stick shift.  It's got a the manual version is nice (personally the only way I'd want a car) and only a little stiff.  I did burn out a clutch, but that's probably just my driving.

This is not a fancy SUV and it is not a fake SUV (like a RAV4), it's just a solid SUV that can be used for whatever you need it.

I really enjoy the design of the 1992, which is similar to the 1998-2000 model and not as boxy as the earlier ones or as curvy as the new ones.

It is true that the Montero did not score well in rollover tests, since it has a narrow wheel base.  However, I take turns quite fast and have been in very windy conditions and have had no actual problems.  I would just recommend not pushing these limits.

There have been very few engine problems and no exterior problems, except some rust and a little paint chiping.

Overall, it runs like a dream.  It has about 115,000 miles and I'm still planning on taking it with me from Maine to NY.

I would definately recommend this vehicle.
