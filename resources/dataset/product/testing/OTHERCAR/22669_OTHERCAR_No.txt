            I purchased a '98 Grand Am GT in February of '98 and have been miffed ever since. Rattles, squeaks, and noises of all sorts are the mainstay of the plastic interior. This is one big complaint. I have always prided myself on taking good care of my car. One week after I bought the car, the dash assembly popped out of its place and would not stay put. Back to the dealer, where it was "fixed." Nope. One more week later, back again. "Fixed." Nope. (Get the picture??) This year, when I had decided enough was enough and having already filed complaints with Pontiac and the Attorney General's office, I decided to roll up the ol' sleaves and try to fix it myself. When I pulled the assembly from its housing, I discovered that the whole male fixture had broken off in the female fixture and that the female fixture had been "fixed" in the past by putting some sort of epoxy on the sides to try to make the dash "stick" to the female side. Lousy job.... Figured it was probably broken at the factory and never discovered. The whole dash doesn't really fit, and the slot where my VIN number is located is buckled due to the poor finish. Built on Monday??? Probably.

Mechanically, I have been happy with a few exceptions. The car overheated in downtown Houston traffic once, and the problem was a blown fan fuse. No prob to fix. The "Check Engine" light came on for awhile at about 40,000 miles, and had me worried for awhile, but it went off. No prob, right??? Unless you count the constant worry. It would be nice to trust my car, ya know?????

My biggest complaint is that I am stuck with a car I no longer enjoy because it is worth a little more than half what I owe on it, even after 2 1/2 years of payments. Sad. When the '99 body style came out, the wholesale value of the older body style went spiraling downward. I know this is a problem with most American models, but it stinks to know that if I want to trade it away, I will have to come up with the GNP of a small country in order to do so. Most dealers tell you to just "grin and bear it," but it's hard to do when you have to put up with it daily. My fiancee purchased a Honda Civic, and has had no problems with it. 

The Car Itself
------------------------------------------------------------
'98 Grand Am GT, 2.4-liter 4-cylinder ("Quad4")
Black exterior, tan cloth interior
All available options except: moonroof, steering wheel audio controls


Engine and Ride
------------------------------------------------------------
The Quad4 does fine for everyday driving and even on longer trips, getting about 31 MPG on the highway.  It does, however, fall into the typical 4-cylinder performance category: great off the line, little to no midrange.  I have always felt that the Quad4 could have benefitted from a turbo.
Shifting is a little harsh, and got worse after 50,000 miles.  Even after I serviced the tranny, it still was a little rough for my tastes.
The car has the GT package, which is a little stiffer than the top-selling SE package.  On the highway, it does great on all but the roughest pavement.  In the city, it gets tiring...


Interior
-----------------------------------------------------------
Getting away from my comments on the poor quality, the interior layout is functional and very ergo-friendly.  Pontiac does a good job at finding the largest buttons for every control, especially the audio system.
The "all-in-one" turn lever, cruise control, high-beam indicator stick is a notorious GM fault, and they should get away from it or make it smaller than the Redwood tree it is now.
The seats are OK for daily driving, but have worn down a bit.  I have driven the car to Pennsylvania from Texas on a few occasions, and I haven't been in Lincoln-type luxury, but they are adequate for 4-5 hour laps.
The rear seat are cramped, and don't have much lumbar support at all.  Put the kids back here...


Overall
------------------------------------------------------------
Besides my rantings concerning the poor build quality, I will have to say that the car itself has served me well mechanically for the 3 1/2 years I have driven it.  The alternator gave out at 70,000, which was followed by the (gulp) computer itself.  At 60,000 miles, I had to replace the rear brake assembly due to a leak that I never knew about.  Other than that, a fan fuse was all I had to do.

UPDATE--- Car was traded in for the '99 Grand Prix GTP (See "Moving up to Prix").  I know it will make someone a good little second car or will make some hot-headed little high-schooler happy for a few years.  Just don't touch the dash...
