            Well, at first I saw this car as a little compact car that drives like a ball of tinfoil. I was goin for at first a muscle or speed car like a firebird or camaro that was used but the dealer convinced me to sit down in the cavalier. I drove it around and was totally suprised on how the z24 drives. It is a little car but with alot of power under the hood. Thats what I wanted mainly when I was looking for a car, POWER! Ever since I bought the car, I have loved driving it every minute. Getting this car also saved me a pretty penny from the camaro or firebird. Plus this car is much safer to drive in nasty michigan winters. I havent had any problems with it yet....great sound system inside, tires are great, roomy in front and sort of in back, lots of trunk space. I like everything about the car, so if you dont got too much to spend on a new car, this is a great one! Good as a first new car or a car bought by parents for their kids. If you have a large build, i wouldnt recommend this to you, or if you have too many kids. It's good for everyone else!<br><br>
