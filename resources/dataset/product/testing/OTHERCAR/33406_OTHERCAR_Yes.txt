            The New Jetta GLS is a perfect car for someone who wants to buy their first car. The 4 cylinder engine is not very powerful in automatic transmission, but if you decide on manual it will be quite adequate. In my opinion though, its much better to spend the extra 1-2k to upgrade to the v6 engine in the GLS V6. The V6 engine is one of the best engines out there for a compact car and I highly recommend it if you can afford it.

The overall style of this car is fantastic. Its looks so stylish that you will be getting more comments about your car than anything else. And do not be deceived by the small appearance of the trunk, its HUGE. I can fit 2 golf bags in there with room to spare. MUCH MUCH bigger than the old Jetta.

The car handles very tight, but unfortunately it is not as fun to drive as the older model. But in exchange for the fun, its a much safer car. Also the mileage isnt as good as it says. But its definately not as bad as others.

The manual transmission is the nicest you can get in this price range. Its so soft and easy to shift, the clutch is like a dream. The wheel is tight and very responsive. I found that if you go above 80 mph the wind noise becomes very very loud, but otherwise the noise is very quite.

In the interior, its very nicely laid out. The cup holder is right in place, even though it does cover the radio. You can get an optional dealer installed CD player (1 in the front/6 in trunk) which also works very well.

This car isnt for everyone though. If I had a big family that would always be riding in this car, I wouldnt suggest buying it. Maybe the Passat, but because the back doesnt have much leg room at all, its proves quite uncomfortable for long rides.

The New Jetta is the most solid car in its price range. Its a very good deal and if you can afford the V6, you will be in driving heaven.
