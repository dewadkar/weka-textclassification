            I bought the 1995 Dodge Neon in May of 1994. It was my first new car and a significant upgrade from my previous car, a 1982 overhauled Toyota Celica. I was still in college and my father co-signed the loan, and insisted that we buy American so my choices were thus limited. Between a Geo Metro and a Dodge Neon, I'd still choose the Neon--even 6 years later.

I have the base model 4-door with a manual transmission. The advertisements that Dodge was running at the time for the Neon gave the car a little personality. &quot;Hi!&quot; the car said and most of my friends seem to think that the car matched my personality quite well. 

I have found the engine to be quite peppy, which is important for someone with a lead foot. When I bought the car, statistics gave the engine time as zero to 60 in 8 seconds, which seems pretty accurate. The inside of the car is on the spartan side, with a back bench that feels like it belongs in a park and manual windows and door locks that I am forever reminding passengers to push. The front seats fit my 6'7&quot; husband comfortably, which scores major points for the Neon, although backseat passengers sitting behind him tend to lose feeling to their feet. I've had no problems with the heat or A/C and I tell anyone complaining about my driving about the airbags in both the driver's and passenger's sides.

Although I have had problems with the car, few of them were out of line with normal maintenance expectations. My biggest complaints about the car had to do with a broken speedometer (the fault for that lies with some bad transmission fluid added by Jiffy Lube) and a leaky sunroof, the latter of which I knew would be a problem when I bought the car but was easily fixed with some apoxy and a wee bit of effort.

I've put over 85,000 miles on the car, traveling from coast to coast and logging lots of in between miles in every type of road and weather condition. The car has definitely taken a beating, but it seems to be like a Timex watch: it just needs a little oil change and some antifreeze and it's good to go. It's the perfect car for someone still in school or just starting out in life, although I am getting ready to upgrade to something a little more advanced.
