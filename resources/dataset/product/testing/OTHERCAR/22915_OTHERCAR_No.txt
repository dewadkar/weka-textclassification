            I bought this as a new vehicle for safety reasons.  I knew that Volvo had a great track record for building some of the safest cars on the road.  For economic reasons, I opted for this low-end model over the expensive 850s that were being offered.
I really do like the ergonomics.  Although not very adjustable, the seats are very comfortable.  This comfort, along with the comfort of having a safe vehicle, make driving the car a great pleasure.
What I don't like about the car, is the high cost of maintenance and repairs.  In particular, not only are the parts priced outrageously, but the wasteful practices of the dealers' shops really take the consumer for a ride.  I recently had my wife take the car to the dealer for new brake shoes at 40,000 miles.  I was told that the rotors also had to be replaced, bringing the cost of the job to over $500.  After making the mistake of trusting the shop, I ended up with only 2 rotors replaced that could easily have been resurfaced instead.  I later found out that Volvo has a policy to never refurbish rotors, as is commonly done once or twice per rotor.  The policy is designed to sell more costly new parts instead of being economical and environmentally friendly.
As if this $500 rip off weren't bad enough, the brakes on the car began to screech with each use after the brake job.  Two more visits to the dealer were necessary before the conclusion was reached that the $640 &quot;brake booster&quot; had managed to expire at the same time the brake job was done.  This was considered to be &quot;coincidence&quot; by the shop and a cost that I would have to bear if I wanted my $500 brake job to sound any good.
The type of person that should by this, or any, Volvo, is someone who has plenty of money in the bank just waiting to pay for auto maintenance.  It should be someone who doesn't blink when told that a quick tune-up ended up costing thousands because the thing-a-ma-bobber and the whatcha-ma-callit decided to call it quits.<br><br>
