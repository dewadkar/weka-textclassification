            I just recently bought a black Honda civic ex 2 door coupe. I just wanted to say I absoloutely love this car. It worth every penny. I added some options such as a rear spoiler, alloy wheels, gold package, mud flaps, wind deflector and security system and I got to say this is one hot looking car. I turn heads where ever I go. Most of my friends cant believe its a civic. They all say it looks like an Acura Integra and technically I think its on the same platform but a hell of alot cheaper than an Acura. The handling, room, comfort, everything about this car is great. I always think of reason to go out just so I can drive. I would highly reccomend this car to college students because its very sporty and practical. Its also a great little car for newlyweds. I'm glad I bought this car and did not lease it because I think I will have this car for a long time.  <br><br>
