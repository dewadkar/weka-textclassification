            This car is a good car if you are not going to be too mad if you get beat off the line at stop lights.  It has great performance and great handling but it does lack in top speed.  But take heart in the fact that you can hold the curves at a much higher speed.  This car can turn with the best of them.  Also it has a cool sound to it, sounds kinda like a race car but it has nothing to really back it up.  
The enigine is a good solid engine, but it lacks power.  
The model I have is the standard everything no luxurys at all, and I get by just fine without them so I would recomend this car if you are looking for a first car or if you just want a basic car that will run faithfully.<br><br>
