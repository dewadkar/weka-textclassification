            It's quite simple.  This car brings a smile to my face everyday.  Subtle, yet sporty elegance grace the outward appearance of this car.  The engine needs a little more &quot;umph,&quot; but it still gives a comfortable and sporty ride.  Rumor has it that the 2002 model will have a V6. If so, I'm excited.

This is the type of car that you hold on to more than a couple of years.  It's reliable, witty, and very confident going down the road.  If you are  looking for a car between $20,000-$25,000, give this one a hard look.  Camry's, Accord's, Malibu's, and Taurus', have overshadowed some great alternatives, like the G20.  This is a deep shame.  Unlike the rest, the G20 offers the &quot;cherry on top&quot; of the sundae when it comes to driving excitement.  You want a family car with pizazz, here you go.  You want a car to accomodate just yourself, here you go.  

We nearly lost the Infiniti G20 in the late '90's due to lack of sales.  It came back from the dead as a fine tuned piece of art.  I hope it's hear to stay for a long, long, time.<br><br>
