            The Canon G3 is my first digital camera that I bought after extensive research and comparing features. www.dpreviews.com is a source that I would recommend to everyone who wants to buy a digital camera.
What I love about the G3 is the quality of the pictures. Landscapes, people, architecture...you get great pictures that are sharp but not too sharp. Everything still looks nice and natural. You probably know the problem of taking pictures in big churches. They are usually blurry and too dark. Not with the G3. The quality is spectacular. I love night pictures and firework pictures a lot. So I played with the settings of the G3 and produces awesome pictures.
The display that is movable in any direction is a feature that I never want to miss. Initially I took all pictures in auto-mode but soon I realized that you have more options in the P mode available and that you need the manual settings for taking good night shots. The G3 give you all the flexibility you need for that.
The video feature is neat and useful for a camera of this size.
When you hold the camera in your hand, you have full control over all buttons. The battery life is just spectacular. Don't waste any money on an extra battery.
A friend of mine made letter size enlargements which are still sharp and detailed and serve as great pictures on the wall.

The downside of the G3 is the autofocus. In very low light situations indoors, it is slow and the G3 is likely to produce blurry picture. The trick is to wait until the autofocus is finished and then take the picture without moving the camera at all. In these situations it is not a snapshot camera. Even though I have the red eye reduction turned on, every now and then I see red eyes in the pictures. Also the flash is sometimes too bright, especially when the objects are close. The colors are then slightly off. The software that comes with it is ok but I would recommend Adobe Photoshop Album to organize the pictures.
