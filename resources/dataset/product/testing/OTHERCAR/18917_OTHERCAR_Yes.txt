            In sept of 2000 i purchased a like new 1993 Cadillac Allante.....20,000 miles for $30,000.00. The care is very responsive with the 295hp V8 northstar engine. It is roomey and comfortable. It was in showroom condition except to a small ding n a from aluminum bumper strip. I took it to the local body shop expecting to pay well over $100.00. I was told it would be $55 for the part and $15 to install it. When i got the bill it was only $48.00 total. I took it to a shop to check it out before i purchased it. I was told it would cost the same to make any repairs to
this car as it would to my 1999 seville since it is the same basic northstar engine. Body parts can be very expensive so make sure you have good insurance. While the bumper strip was only $48.00 a new front bumber is over $2,500.00.
the ride is very good for a convertibe. The convertible top can be taken down and put back up in less than 10 seconds.
The best thing when buying an allante is to buy the best one on the market that you can find. 
It was the car i had always wanted. It ran 65,000 to 85,000 when new and at $30,000 now is a fantastic deal compared to a new cadillac with the same engine.
I love the looks of the car.....the excelleration and handling. It is the most fun car i have driven since 1970 when i started driving.
If you buy this car figure to spend money on repairs because it is still a GM car.<br><br>
