            The 1992 Geo Metro XFi is the mileage king, heck, it even beats the mileage of the brand new Metros which now come with a 4 cylinder engine.

I bought this car for the low cost, high mileage and hatchback space. My mileage checks from work covered my car payments, all my gas costs (including personal driving) and I still had some money left over, so it was like having a free car. Now that I've long paid it off I get to pocket the mileage checks for my next car purchase.

At 157K this car still gets an average of 47mpg for me! Although it's no cargo hauler I've stuffed at least a half dozen big trash bags filled with yard trash in the back (with the seat down) with no problems, I'm always surprised how much stuff I can get into this little car. the low-end torque with the 5-speed give the tiny engine a little bit of guts although don't expect to get up highway hills quickly.

Maintenance is cheap and easy, I changed oil myself often (which has probably kept the car in good shape), got the timing belt changed at 100K as a precaution, clutch changed also. All told a great purchase for me since it saved me big bucks in car costs.

The heater fan gave out on me a year ago (didn't get it fixed) and had problems with the door handle mechanism since it got hit by a car while parked. Also the exhaust pipe rusted through in front of the muffler (got someone to weld it back together). Engine computer died at 155K, got that replaced with a used one.

Overall I got my money's worth out of this car and co-workers can't believe I still get about 50mpg on the highway.<br><br>
