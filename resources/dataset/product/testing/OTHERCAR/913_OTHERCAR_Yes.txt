            I recently test drove the 6 cylinder version of this beautifully styled, well appointed new entry into the American luxury/sports sedan market.  I was extremely impressed.  As a current owner of a Nissan Maxima, aggressive styling, power, and options were definitely on my mind.  From the time I sat down in the body hugging leather seats and turned on the amazingly quiet engine, I felt connected.  I have never driven a car under 35K that connects the driver to the car and road as well as the LS does.  I can just imagine what the 8 cylinder feels like.

Finally someone has created a sports sedan with a stick.  I may have to drive clients around and act mature from 9-5, but when the weekend hits and the sunroof opens, I want to feel connected to my car.  With a German transmission and gearbox and a stick I swear was designed with me in mind, this car definitely rocks my boat.  210 horsepower, the best design I have ever seen an American company come up with and a sticker under 35K.  You can guarantee I will be an owner in Y2K!!!<br><br>
