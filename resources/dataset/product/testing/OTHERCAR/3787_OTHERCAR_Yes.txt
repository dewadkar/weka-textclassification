            The first thing that I thought when I saw this fancy sports car was, what kind of car is that!  I have not seen a more sleek and stylish car than the BMW M3.  This car is filled with everything a good sports car needs.  You can purchase this car in either a coupe (hard top), or a convertible, and let everything loose as you cruise down the road.  The M3 is also a very safe car.  It is equipped with front side air bags and 4-wheel antilock brakes.  You should not have to worry about getting hurt in this car.

The M3 has raw power when on the road.  With a 240 horsepower engine, you don�t have to worry about anyone racing against you.  They know that you will just blow them off the road with the M3.  What I love most about the BMW M3 is all of the comfortable room it offers.  The front seats are adjustable, but no one will ask you to move up because there is plenty of room in the back.  The adjustable sport seats offer maximum comfort.  I could sleep in this car and never complain about it.

The BMW M3 is a very quiet car also.  While driving the M3, you do not hear any annoying outside noises that are a pain in most cars when you are trying to enjoy the ride.  The engine is quiet also, so you don�t have to worry about hearing a loud engine either.  The M3 is tiptronic. This means that the transmission can be automatic or manual stick shift.  For those of you who believe that every sports car needs a stick shift, you got it in the M3 if you want.  

Since there are five seats in the BMW M3, it can fit your family or a bunch of your friends.  I recommend this car for anyone.  If you feel the desire for a need for speed or if you are trying to impress some of the ladies, this is definitely the car.  The only downside to this wonderful car is the price.  Although it is not super high, it is a little more expensive than a normal car.  Well, the BMW M3 is not normal, it�s in a class by itself.<br><br>
