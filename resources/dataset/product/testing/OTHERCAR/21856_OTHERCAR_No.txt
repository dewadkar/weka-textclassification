            I�ve read good things about Subarus, and enjoyed driving the Outback. But this review is not about the car, so much as my attempt to buy one from a specific dealership, namely Carlsen Subaru, at 480 Veterans Boulevard in Redwood City, California, 94063. Specifically, it's about this dealer's sleaze-ball sales tactics and horribly rude sales force and owners. Let me state up front that I would NEVER recommend buying from this dealership. If you want to know why, read on.

This is about a clear, but subtle, case of bait-and-switch sales. On July 21, I drove into the Carlsen Subaru dealership and had a look around. I asked to see �Legacy Outbacks with about 50,000 miles on them.� Alan Vincent, a �sales representative,� showed me exactly two cars: a 1996 Subaru Legacy Outback and a 1997 car of the same model.  I like the clean looks of the 1996 Subaru, with 59,000 miles, on it, and asked him �how much?�

Mr Vincent said there was a �big credit union sale this weekend� and the price had been drastically cut. He produced a sheet of paper from his pocket, looked down the list, which I could almost read over his shoulder, with car descriptions and prices written in large, block letters. He found the car, and said: �$12,995. Thirteen thousand. We lowered it from 14,999 for this weekend. The automatic in the 96 has the 2.5 Liter engine. The others had the 2.2. The 2.5 is a much better engine. Would you like to start it up?� I said yes, and he looked on the SAME piece of paper at the SAME car description, to get the key number, and went to get the key. He brought the key back to me immediately and there was no doubt he and I were looking at and talking about exactly the same car.

I spent a half hour inspecting the car exhaustively � crawling under it, lifting the hood, checking the fluids, listening to the engine at all RPMs, inspecting the tire tread, and so on. 13 grand looked like a good price for this car in this shape.

At the end of my inspection, Mr Vincent asked how I like the car. I asked again: �You said it was $13,000, right?�

�Just for this weekend!� he said.

�In that case, I�ll come back with my wife and baby girl in the morning,� and we did.

Wife, daughter and daddy all trundled back down to the dealer. I showed my wife the car and out came Mr Vincent. �You said $13,000, right?� My first question.

�That�s right,� he said.

�We�d like to drive it.�

�Fine.� He took out that piece of paper, got the key number and off he went for the key.

So the three of us took the car for a long test drive, through town, up into the hills, on the freeway. We were gone a solid hour, including the time to park the car in the shade and go over every inch with a fine tooth comb for rust, dents, wrinkles or more. We quickly fell in love with the car. It was stable and responsive, cornered and accelerated quickly, and was quieter than I expected. My wife admired how clean it was and my two-year-old girl was singing along to the children's tape strategically left in the cassette deck (it hadn�t been there the night before and I had to be the last one to start the car  that night, since it was closing time when I left. But didn�t I mention my baby girl to the salesman�?). By the time we returned to the dealer, we already considered the car part of our family and we had made the difficult decision to offer a little below the 13 thousand asking price. 

Mr Vincent went into the office to �check if he had that much room� in the price. When he returned, he said �We must have been talking about a different car. There�s a Legacy over there that�s $13,000, but this car is $13,995. I�ve got 13,100 into this car, and I couldn�t go below $13,995.�

It was an obvious lie. He figured he had me hooked on the car and what�s a thousand bucks, anyway? I began to fume.

�You told me repeatedly that this car was 13 thousand,� I complained. �You looked right at this car on your sheet and told me. And I never once asked you about or looked at a Legacy.�

He became almost instantly belligerent. �I made a mistake. There�s nothing I can do about it. Haven�t you ever made a mistake?�

�Yes,� I said. �And usually I�ve had to pay for my mistakes.�

�Well there�s nothing I can do,� he huffed. And then he took the key I tossed to him and walked off.

My daughter refused to come out of the back seat. �This car! This car!� she was yelling, as she bounced in her child seat. My wife and I just groaned.

The final straw was calling the owner after I got home. His name was Mr Feechese (he refused to give me the actual spelling of his name, so that�s probably not quite right.) He must have been expecting my call. &quot;I have a feeling I already know who this is. It�s about the 96 Outback, right?�

�That�s right. My wife and I are pretty upset.� I was, although I managed to stay calm on the phone.

�I already know who this is, and what it's about, and it's absolutely ridiculous. And I�m not really interested if you want to know the truth.&quot; When I asked him simply to listen to what I had to say, he laughed: &quot;I really don't care what you have to say, and I'm not interested in listening to you any further.&quot; And then he hung up.

If there�s something I learned from this experience, it�s that Subaru dealers, at least the rude, belligerent, dishonest, misleading, and shifty dealers and owners at Carlsen Subaru, are exactly like the creepy stereotype car dealers you always hear and read about. They lived up to my very low expectations in every way, and are exactly why every everyone hates going to car lots.

I wish there was some way to hold them accountable for the behavior, but there�s probably only one: anyone considering a purchase at Carlsen Subaru, should avoid this dealership like the good old fashioned sleezy rip-off that it is. My advice? Shop online instead.
