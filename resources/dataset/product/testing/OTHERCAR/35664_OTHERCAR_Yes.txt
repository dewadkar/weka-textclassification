            2003 Accord Coupe v6 EX-L

This is my second Honda. It was a no-brainer to buy this car, my 1990 Honda Coupe Ex is still running fine. This time around, I was considering entry-level BMW&#146s, Nissan, and possibly the Infinity G35 Coupe, but my previous experience with Honda was the ultimate deciding factor. Perhaps it is not fair to compare Honda with near-luxury cars, but I believe this Honda gives them a run for the money. I&#146ve been a passenger in BMWs and Mercedes, and I can&#146t say that I was ever impressed by the &#145feel&#146 of the suspension system. I&#146ve always liked the way Honda &#145feels&#146 on the road, solid and firm. It&#146s a bias that is going to be hard for me to overcome anytime in the near future.

When people look or step into my car, they ask &#147what kind of car is this&#148? They seem to be confused by the leather seats and the handling/performance of my car. I think Honda should try putting hood ornaments on their higher end cars, as long as they don't change the price.

I&#146ve never been one to emphasize the exterior of a car, but many have commented on the styling alone. The selling point for me is how the car feels and drives, and long-term reliability. I have a friend who test-drove several BMW&#146s and she says none of them are as nice as my Honda&#146s interior. An added bonus with this car is performance, which is excellent! ALL have commented, if not been completely blown away, by the acceleration. Acceleration figures are just as good as the entry-level BMWs. (Though the total driving experience is not directly comparable to a high-end sports car). There is enough power in this car to break all stereotypes of Honda being a &#145practical&#146 car. And the braking will stop you on a dime. Some have commented on my Honda being a &#145fun&#146 car.
 
Cabin noise is fairly low, and the engine is quiet at crusing speeds. It is easy to get into trouble if you are in a hurry; I now know what it feels like to see other cars in the rear-view mirror appear to &#147stand still&#148 when passing. 

Dash mounted CD-changer, steering wheel mounted audio and dual-climate controls are a big plus. User functionality of the climate control system is flawless, there is no guessing as to what buttons to push. (Some BMW models have '1'&#146s and '0'&#146s for On or Off, a bit comical in my mind) Backlighting of the drivers&#146 console is excellent, as is the interior lighting which is bright enough to comfortably read any size print on a map or note. 

But the gas mileage is that of a v6, drive it on the fast side, and gasoline gets a bit expensive as compared to a typical 4-cylinder. 

Though the car is too new to have a history, I expect the same reliability as my old Honda. Honda, as a company is doing very well, and it is easy to see why. They make quality products.
