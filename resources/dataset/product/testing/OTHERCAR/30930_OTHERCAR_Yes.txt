            I  purchased my Sebring in late &quot;96 used after seeing a few on the road.  Yes, the svelt blonde i saw driving one did sway my mind a bit. *S*  After test driving the one i purchased i knew it was a  car i had to have during my &quot;mid life crisis&quot;.  Cherry red, black topped convertible!!  How much more studly can i get? *laugh*  The model I bought was the JX. It had the V6 auto with power windows door locks and keyless entry, standard AM/FM/Cass radio.  The top with the JX model is the vinyl version but it felt sturdy and tight.  I'll try and list the pro and cons of the car below:

1. Body
PROS:
Sleek, handsome looking car.  Gets waves and seconds looks throughout town.  Nice looking paint job.  Adequate trunk space. Wide wheel base for nice cornering.

CONS:
No rain gutters on a drop top. This prohibits open windows (even slightly)during any kind of rain.  This dripping also caused a short in the electrical mirror switch.  The engine compartment is quite full of STUFF and the battery has to be changed from the drivers side wheel well. During one period of heavy downpour (I live in Seattle), water leaked into the rear wheel wells on both sides due to the inadequate size of the drain holes in said wheel wells, causing my back seat floor boards to flood. (fixed holes and replace carpet under warranty).

2. Interior
PROS:
Roomy front and back seat. (I'm 6'4&quot; large frame) Comfortable in long trips.  Convenient controls and factory sound system was above average in my opinion.  Six way adjustable drivers seat very nice to have.  The levers to unlock the top for putting it down hold the top securely and tight.  Have had to this day, No water leaks. (other than the open windows)  Very LOW outside noise for a convertible.  And last but not least, the sound of the rain on a drop top is very soothing. *S*  The driving view, even for someone as tall as I am, is very good.

CONS:
Although i didn't have near the electrical problems that some had, i had to bring back the car for replacement of the heater control know 3 times.  This was a source of MAJOR frustration for me.  

3.  Drive Train
PROS:
The V6 is a snappy little motor with plenty of power and speed when you need it.  Oil fills and fluid level checks are easy to see and easy to get to.  Transmission has been without problems as are the other components of the drive train.

CONS:

Due to the small engine compartment and various and sundry emissions control garbage the battery had to be placed in the front of the drivers side wheel well and accessed from there.

4.  Overall

I love this car and would HIGHLY recommend this car to anyone.  You just can't beat driving this car on a warm summer day, top down, wind blowing through your hair, which by the way is minimal.  IF you have the money, look into the JXI version of this car.  It offers a few more amenities and one version comes with a combo automatic/manual transmission.  For those sports car enthusiasts, this gives you the  option to &quot;tap shift&quot; the car manually.
