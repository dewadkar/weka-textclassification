            I recently purchased this camera after my husband did research and picked out 3 of the best cameras.  Then it was my turn to find the best deal.  I picked the Toshiba PDR-M5 and I'm glad I did!  The quality is great.  I put some of my pictures on the Internet for my family to see and they are just amazed at how well they turned out.  I have not had one picture to have red eye, and they are all clear and crisp.  This camera allows you to change the quality of the pictures in order for you to fit more in the memory at one time.  Even the lowest resolution still takes good pictures.

The software is very easy to use.  With only 3 or 4 clicks, you can upload your pictures to your hard drive and you have the option of deleting them off your camera, or leaving them on.  You can change the look or the size of the picture as well.  If it came out to dark, you can brighten it.  You can change the colors as well as some other things too.
