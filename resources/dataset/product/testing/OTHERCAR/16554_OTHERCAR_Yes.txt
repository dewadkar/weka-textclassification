            We have a 1996 Safari, that we bought new in 1996.  It now has 120,000 miles on it, and it has been great.  We have had no major problems with it, it runs great, is reliable, fairly good on gas mileage (25 hwy; 19 city) and is roomy for the family.  The only problem was the knobs on the temperature controls.  They broke three times and we had to replace them, the first two were under warranty, the last set we bought (about $3 apiece), and those have lasted over a year.

The seat is in the very back comes out fairly easily, but is somewhat harder to get back in.  Even with the seat in, and moved forward, there is a huge amount of room.  

The built in car seats have been very convenient, and they are not in the way with not in use.  The back three doors are functional and easy to use.

The difficulty with this van is trying to work under the hood.  The plugs are difficult to get to, you first have to remove the front wheels.  Changing the oil is easy however.  There have been no problems with the transmission.  We did have to replace the tensioner pulley which was fairly easy to do.  The check engine light used to come on all the time, but since the pulley was replaced, it has not been a problem.  The windshield wipers do not do a wonderful job of cleaning the windshield without rain.  It is almost as if they are not snug enough against the windshield.

Overall, though even with the above minor problems, this is a great van, and we will likely trade it on a new Safari when it is time.<br><br>
