This camera was our first digital camera purchase.  We've had it for about a year and a half and have taken over 2000 snapshots with it.  We have been extremely happy with it--and that's what matters to us.  Recently, we had to replace it, and had a wide array of cameras to choose from.  We knew better this time what features mattered, what we liked, etc.  We looked at a lot of cameras, and what did we buy?  Another Kodak.  In the end, it didn't matter what all the camera experts said--for sheer ease of use and good solid picture-taking, the Kodak stands head and shoulders above the rest.

I'll leave all the technical details to other camera experts.  If you want to know what a standard user thinks of using this thing day to day?  Read on!  Pictures are crisp, camera is easy to use.  We also like that the camera came with a good pack of accessories like the battery recharger and the USB cord.  The latter makes transferring photos extremely fast, which really conserves batteries.  With a lot of other digital cameras we considered, we were going to have to turn around and spend even more $$ --sometimes a LOT of money--on accessories just to make it practical to use.

The camera stores around 18 images, though sometimes more (if you choose to buy a bigger memory card, picture storage will go up proportionately).  The screen allows you to instantly see and evaluate the shots you've taken.  A simple-to-use icon menu makes it easy to review and/or delete photos on the fly.  It's significantly easier to use and understand the menu than other brands we looked at.  When we want to see our photos on the "big screen," or mail them out, it's simple to just plug the camera into the laptop.  We transfer the camera's contents via Windows Explorer, and then open and edit the images in Paint Shop Pro.  That's not the only way to do it, of course, but that works for us.

Another nice feature is the lens cap.  It's attached to the camera on a cord, so you don't lose it.  It fits snugly, but pops off if you grab the camera in too much of a hurry to pull it off yourself.  When the lens moves forward (as it does when the camera turns on) the cord draws tight and the lens cap pops off).  Yet it's snug enough that it doesn't fall off otherwise.  It's a nifty little trick.

I can't stress this enough:  <b>use the USB connector. Do so, and you can discount any comment anyone has written about this camera being "slow."</b>  We lost our connector for a few weeks and were using the standard transfer procedure.  It felt like torture after being used the zippy transfer via USB.

The small annoying thing about this camera is that the review window is lined up perfectly with my nose when I use the viewfinder.  Every time I take a photo, I leave a noseprint on the screen.  Also, you need to be conscious of the focus feature.  We've a had a few  pictures that came out a little fuzzy because we focused and then waited for the shot--and moved the camera.  Our fault, but good to be aware of.  

Also, 1.3 megapixels is adequate for most things, but there were a few times when we wanted to print photos and a higher pixel image would have been better.  These days, you can get more megapixels for the money.  But if you're taking basic photos, this'll do it for you.

Here's a comment on digital cameras in general, in case you're debating whether you'd use one enough to justify its purchase:  I never thought we'd get much use of one, and thought my husband was impulsive when we bought it.  But we use it EVERY day.  I've never before felt free to snap off a dozen or more photos in an attempt to get that perfect shot--but now I do.  We can just delete the ones that didn't work.  And when you're dealing with things like baby milestones, you want to be able to take tons of pictures.   It's nice, also, to be able to send distant grandparents a new photo every single day.  No scanning.  No developing.  No running out of film.  We use it much much more than I ever expected.

MORE THAN ONE YEAR LATER:

It can take a lot of abuse.  We've thrown the thing in the diaper bag or stuffed it in luggage numerous times, never with a bag or covering.  We finally had a service problem with it, and had to replace it because the store preferred to do and exchange rather than a repair.  The store no longer carries the DC-240 (maybe they don't make it anymore?) so we had to replace it, but we replaced it with a camera as close to this as possible.  I'm not ready to say the problem indicates a reliability issue, because we took over 2000+ snaps with it and dished out tons of abuse.

This camera is just a little larger than our regular 35 mm camera, and that's a plus.  If it were bulkier, we might be less willing to throw it in the diaper bag and take it with us.

The little rubber plug that fits into the USB port and protects it from dirt, etc when not in use?  It has broken off.  The little rubber connector just wasn't strong enough to hold up to daily removal and replacement.  This is a flaw, but a small one.  A family which used their camera less might never run into this.  

Had I know how much we were going to use it, I would have gladly shelled out for a camera that was a little nicer (more megapixels).  But honestly, we've been exceeding happy with this one.  It's a good little mid-price digital camera.
