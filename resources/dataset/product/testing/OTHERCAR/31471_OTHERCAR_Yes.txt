            This was the first car I ever purchased. It runs very well, especially on the highway. It has electronic features such as power windows and locks, as well as cruise control. The display is digital. The driver seat is also powered. The back seat is spacious and comfortable for tall passengers, no matter how far back the fronts seats are placed. The back seat pulls down for access into the trunk and for transporting longer items which wouldn't normally fit into a trunk. It survived a trip to Florida from Massachusetts in the summer without any trouble. Being only 5'2&quot;, I thought I might have trouble seeing over the dashboard, but the seats were adjustable enough to allow for comfort while driving without being too close to the steering wheel, which could pose more problems in an accident.The automatic button for the driver window allows the driver to push the button once while driving to lower the window completely in order to avoid the distraction of the driver not having both hands on the steering wheel for a longer period of time. The only reasone I have had to bring it into the body shop for a major problem was to have the oxygen filter changed. I have had the car now for 2 years.<br><br>
