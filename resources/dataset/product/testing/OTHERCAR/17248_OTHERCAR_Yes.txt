            My wife got a 1999 Dodge Intrepid as a company car, so we didn't spend our cold hard cash to get it.  Thus, I don't feel biased one way or the other towards it.

Overall, I give it a &quot;B&quot; grade.  Here's a breakdown on my thoughts:

STYLING: A nice looking car and probably one of its best features. It's much better looking than the vanilla put out by the likes of other car companies.  My wife certainly gets a lot of people asking her how she likes it while she's at a stoplight or in a parking lot.

POWER/HANDLING: Very good acceleration, handles well on turns, great brakes.

SOUNDS: This is a very quiet car, I can barely hear the engine unless I floor it.

AESTHETICS:  The gauges are the ugliest ever...white circles. Very odd. I'm sure you can get a model with gauges that don't stand out like this.  The AC/Temp control are very easy to use, very responsive and aesthetically pleasing. The factory stereo (radio/cassette) is decent, but my wife couldn't figure out how to program it. It isn't all that inherent to operate, but it sounds good.  Good cup holder up front, but kind of in the way when you want to rest your arm on the center console/arm rest.

GAS: Because my wife's company pays for gas too, I haven't worried about gas milage, but it seems to get about 350 miles per tank. Not the best, but not bad for a big car.

ROOMINESS: Lots of room here. The Intrepid is a very wide car. Lots of room in the back seat, and a good sized trunk.

WHAT'S MISSING:  You can't fold down the back seat for accessing the trunk or putting longer things in the trunk.

PROBLEMS: As with most American cars I've driven (rentals, company cars, friends, parents), the electrical system has some problems. This car always has either a window or side mirror that does not work.  I hate it.  My '92 4Runner has power everything and has never had such problems.

The biggest problem with this car, however, is its significant blind spots.  The trunk is high compared to the front end of the car, which makes seeing things behind you a little harder than with most cars, but the the traditional blind spots (each side of the rear window, left and behind the driver and even each side of the windshield) are impressive.  The &quot;beam&quot; that runs down the left side of the windshield is particularly dangerous.  If you test drive one of these puppies, definitely take note of where you can't see.  I've never driven a car with such blind spots.

There you have it.  I wouldn't have bought the car myself, but it's certainly comfy and nice to drive.<br><br>
