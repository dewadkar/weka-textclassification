            The MX-700 and the MX-2700 are the best digital cameras for my money. They are small and light and even fit in your top shirt pocket. They give great results with the highest resolution. The flash memory card makes it trivial to transfer images to a notebook or a desktop computer. The aluminium case is durable and makes the camera very light weight. The only things that could be improved are a brighter flash and an optical zoom lense - which should come soon with new technology.<br><br>
