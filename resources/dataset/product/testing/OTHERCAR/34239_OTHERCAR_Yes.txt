            Test drove the 2000 celica as I already have a 1990 and loved it. Had trouble fitting in the Celica with a sunroof so took a Solara for a test drive and fell for it.

I drive 100 miles round trip each day to work and the Solara handles so well on the freeways and in the Colorado Snow. Really like the new gadgets, like the rear view mirror that dims the glare of the SUV's, the triple garage door opener so you don't have to carry the remote as it is built into the roof, the auto temp control which doesn't kick on in the winter till the car is warm enough to warm you up and not freeze you out. big trunk, ergonomics are great but all Toyotas are that way. The V6 gets you in and out of jams and the anti slip drive is good on snow. The in dash 6 CD changer makes it nice to cruse and listen to good music,  Car gets about 25 MPG so not bad for someone with a heavy foot. Forgot to get the 6 speed as I would had to wait for three months and miss my manual shift.

Wish they had more colors as I wanted blue but settled for red.   Not the car for the drive 5 miles per day but wonderful for someone who is traveling a distance and who likes a car that handles very well.<br><br>
