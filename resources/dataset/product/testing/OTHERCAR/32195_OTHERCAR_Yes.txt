            I bought a new Chevy Cavalier for several reasons. First and foremost was to lower my monthly payment. Second was due to the fact I was driving my Jeep Wrangler over 65 miles a day and not getting very good gas mileage. Last but not least was that my Jeep had 100,000 miles on it and I knew major repairs were not far away. Probably the thing that most impressed me was the quality of the sales department and their willingness to work to get my payments lowered. I fully expected to drive away in a Metro with no options but was surprised that with some fancy financial work, instead I drove away in a much better car.Chevy should be commended on their sales work. Secondly, the fit and finish of the car is outstanding and much improved over years gone by. I have owned Camaros, Chevelles, and a Corvette and I am not disappointed in this car. Overall on a scale of 1-10 I would rate my experience buying this car as an 8.<br><br>
