            My mother bought a �98 SL2 in August of �97. Last March I was driving her car to pick my husband up from work, when a woman ran a red light doing about 50 mph. I saw he coming and I put the peddle to the floor. Well, the car doesn't have good pick up being only a 4 cylinder. The woman hit the back end of the car, broke the rear axel, caved in the left rear fender, smashed the driver door and left back seat door. Thanks to the seat belt I was not seriously hurt, my 1 � year old, at the time, was in the back seat in his car seat in the middle. He was totally untouched!! Well, this August my husband and I went out and bought �99 SL2. I love this car, now my son is 2 � and I have a 2 month old also. I feel so safe driving with them in the car now, knowing all the safety features. The price wasn't that bad at all, I love the fact that I can have the same safety features as a Volvo without the high price. My father worked for General Motors, and before he passed away he said the Saturn where going to be the best affordable cars around. I have to agree with him. I recommend this car highly, this is great family car.<br><br>
