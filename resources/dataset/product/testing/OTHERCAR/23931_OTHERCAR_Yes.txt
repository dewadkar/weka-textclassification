            The Mercedes SLK has been one of my favorite vehicles for a long time. I have been both the driver and passenger of the SLK230 and the new SLK320. If you are looking for a real sports car, you should take a look at the Honda S2000 of the M Roadster. The Mercedes SLK is a sport all-season roadster. Holding down the little red switch turns the little coupe into a topless cruiser. The handling of the SLK is very good for normal driving and even for some harder driving. But, it just lacks the properties of a real sports car. Foremost: speed. The SLK230's 0-60 has been clocked anywhere from 6.9sec all the way to 8.2 sec. To me it feels somewhere in between. In place of the sports car properties, the SLK owner gets lots of comfort features. The seats are firm, and provide good support, on long trips this is very important. Heated seats have always been an option, along with Digital StarTAC's. The car also comes with a standard Bose stereo. Which sounds good even with the top down, which is rare. The newer SLK320 sports a 3.2 liter V6, new rims and a slightly different front and rear skirts. Xenon(HID) headlights are now also an option on the SLK320. The added power of the 320 is great. It easily brings the car's 0-60 into the mid to upper 6 second range, and of course give the car a better sound. This car will not allow you to race someone is a BMW M3 or AUDI S4, but it will get you 10 as many people looking at you. It all depends what you want. I have always liked the feeling of Mercedes. I am pretty young but have been lucky enough to get to drive all of them at one time or another. The SLK is a great but, but if you have the extra bucks in your wallet. Don't forget to take a look at the CLK, you may like it better.<br><br>
