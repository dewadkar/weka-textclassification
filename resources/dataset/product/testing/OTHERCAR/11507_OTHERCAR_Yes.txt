            The Maxima was the first car I topped the 140mph barrier in a couple of years ago. At the time I was very impressed that it could get to that speed. 

Well, the time came to evaluate the new 20th Anniversary SE Maxima since my brother decided he just had to have a brand new car, and settled on this one. 

Being the habitual speeder that I am, I was determined to take the Maxima out and see just what it could do and drive it in ways that my more sensible brother wouldn't dare.

Let us start with the most important thing in a car, and go down in levels of importance.

<b>Acceleration</b>
How fast can it get up and go? Can I smoke cars at the Red Light ? That kind of childish nonsense is still very important to me at the advanced age of 28.
If quarter mile speeds is what you're looking for, go elsewhere. The Maxima is a SLOTH at speeds below 60. In fact, it takes just to long to get to 60. He claimed it went from 0-60 in about 8.3 seconds. After stomping on the gas over and over from a dead stop, I believe this figure to be accurate.
0-60 is only a marginal concern to me. What I find more important is, what does it have after 60? After 80? After 100?
After 60 the Maxima began to impress me, and impress me A LOT.
Why? It kept right on going, no <i>"I think I can, I think I can"</i> hesitation, it appeared to take as long to get from 60-120 as it did from 0-60. No lag, no slowing down of the speedometer needle, it just kept sweeping up until about 115, then it slowed a little as it hit the 125 mark. SADLY, I ran into to much traffic to see if I could again push a Maxima to 140. Blame the jerk doing only 70 in the high speed lane for not moving out of the way as I flashed the headlights from about a half mile away for stopping this experiment I was conducting in the interests of informing you. Get off the road you pest in your Green Grand Marquis. A few safety notes: Never pass cars on the right at over 110, you just don't know if they'll see you and decide to move out of your way, and instead move into your way, and then, you'll have one hell of a wreck. And, you'll be at fault, and that's never a good thing, as there is no one to sue then.

Faster low end acceleration can be gained by turning off the overdrive, a little button on the gear shift lever. The dealer did mention not to drive around at high speeds to much with the OD off. But with the overdrive off, you can stomp on the gas and spin those big expensive tires mounted on the 17 inch rims this car comes with. I take great pride knowing my driving will result in my brother having to buy new tires one or two weeks sooner than he should.

Despite the low end power leaving so much to be desired, the high end performance of the Maxima make up for the lack of 0-60 times. 

<b>Handling</b>
Going hand in hand with high speed highway driving is handling. I suppose the big tires help out a lot, but the suspension is most excellent. The Maxima sports a better suspension system than most American cars with the exception of the Corvette. Taking highway turns at 125 and hitting bumps in those turns should result in at the very least a bit of tire squeak or maybe even a loose feeling. Nope, not a bit of either. The Maxima is SOLID. You can throw the Maxima into turns at normal speeds and not expect it to break free. Being front wheel drive, powering out of the turn is a breeze, and impressive if you keep the RPMs up in the power range. 

<b>POWER</b>
It is a very nice 227hp, but does take till 6400 RPM to get all those horses up and galloping. Red line is just a bit beyond this.

<b>Cruising Speed.</b>
80mph, situated at 12 O'Clock high on the speedometer leads to 3000 RPMs. To me, that seems like a high rate to be running the engine, but it is so smooth.

<b>VOLUME!</b>
This car is to quiet. It doesn't sound mean. It doesn't roar, it doesn't once shout out that it means business. I think you need to drill a hole in a muffler or something so it can get some attitude.
The Maxima is so well insulated that you never hear much more than a gentle hum of the engine. Surprisingly, wind noise is almost nonexistent, even at speeds in the 120s.

<b>ROOM</b>
The interior of the Maxima is HUGE.
The first time I sat in the passenger seat, I felt left out of the riding experience, I was really far from the dash board, I had an enormous amount of leg room, I felt like I was on a couch.
The Back-seat, not much different. I even had a better arm rest in the back than the one in the front.

<b>Radio</b>
You can control it from the steering wheel. Nifty eh? That annoys me, one less thing to take my hands off the wheel and tempt fate. The speaker system is great, and even the positioning of them is well thought out. Back seat passengers do not have speakers located directly in the middle of behind their heads. They no longer have to be left out of every conversation because they can't hear the front seat people. 

<b>Cup holders</b>
Yep, they got that.

<b>Visibility</b>
(OK, so that's a bit more important than the aforementioned stuff)
Great. Big windows, no blind spots I found. And the view out the back was spacious. The little rear spoiler does not get in the way.

<b>SUNROOF</b>
Cool power sunroof. Everybody oooo and aaaaaa now. 

<b>Dual Airbags.</b>
Airbags are good, because not only are they claimed to save your life, they can cut and or burn you upon activation. These cuts, bruises and burns can add hundreds, and sometimes even thousands to a settlement.

Where's the Antenna?
There isn't one outside, it's integrated into the windshield or something. One less thing for the punks to snap off. 

All the other goodies:
Yes, its got cruise control, air conditioning, power everything, tilt wheel, you name it. 

<b>Gas Mileage.</b>
The 3.0 V6 gets around 20 in the city, and 27 on the highway. Most certainly lower when I drive it. But with gas costing only 1.23 a gallon out here, I don't care. 

<b>$$$$$$$$$$$$</b>
He bought this car cheap. $21,000. Amazing for what he got.

Finally, yes, there is plenty of room to stick a couple of bodies in the trunk.

Oh, and there are these weird little pictures of child seats on parts of the back seats. Apparently these are child seat anchors. I don't see why child seats need anchors, you don't sail with a child seat, and affixing an anchor to a child seat will probably result in a drowned kid, and that doesn't seem to be a good thing.
