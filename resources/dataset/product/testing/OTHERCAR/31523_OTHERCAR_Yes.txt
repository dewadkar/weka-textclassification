            I bought my Sentra new in 1987 as a stripped down car with 5-speed and a/c.  That's it.  I put in the radio.  Things didn't start out too good - incredibly bad experience buying the car then the trunk leaked and held water in the spare tire compartment and it would slosh up and get the rear seat carpet wet enough that some came off with a shop vac.  BUT...

Since those original problems, the car has been incredible.  Driven from Virginia to and from Colorado (painfully underpowered at altitude), down to Flordia and up to New Hampshire.  What can I say?  198,000 miles and nary a problem since the first year.  I change my own brakes, never had the rotors turned, change my own oil (synthetic).  I did have the gas pump changed twice (@ $100 each time), alternator once (@ $150), and radiator ($130 and I replaced it in 2 hours!!).  Maybe the worst part has been the muffler and exhaust pipe being changed 3 times, but I got Midas the first time and have paid $80 each time afterwards.  The car has been hit in the rear a couple of times, but still tracks fine.  Actually, the worst thing is the alignment.  Doesn't seem to hold it well in the front, but I just buy the low mileage tires at 4 for $80 every couple of years.  

So, my eopinion is this car will last and cost very little along the way.  Great if you're trying to conserve the cash for other fun things, like driving through blizzards to your favorite ski resort.  Heck, this car ROCKS in the snow!  It can't be stopped!

Oh yeah, it STILL gets 35 mpg, just like when I first bought it.<br><br>
