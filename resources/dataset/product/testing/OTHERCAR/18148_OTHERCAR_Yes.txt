            Let me start off by saying that I'm 18 years old, and this was the first car (van, if you prefer) I have ever driven, and it turned out pretty well for me.  It is my parents' car, and I like how when you're driving it, you can see all around you as opposed to in a car where you're fairly low on the road.  The model we have is a fully loaded GXE (I believe that's what it's called..) with leather seats, rear a/c controls, radio, etc.

<b>Interior</b>

The seats on this car, leather in our case, are incredible.  They have good lumbar support and the front buckets can be positioned in just about any way.  The two rear bucket seats are nice as well, but could use some more leg room.  The back bench seat could definitely use some space improvement, but it's nicely designed otherwise.  The seatbelts on the front seats are the automatic ones that run along a track.  Along with that auto-shoulder belt there is a lap belt you must strap on manually as well.  I always remember to use this as a driver, but many times when I have passengers they forget to put on the lap belt and I only notice about half way through the drive.  That is sort of scary, and I wish the whole belt was automatic, or it wasn't automatic as well.  I end up having to remind people to get the lap belt every time, which is sort of embarassing and makes me feel like a bus driver.

There are two cupholders up front which pop down from the side of the seat.  They are O.K. but could be bigger for extra value meal cups and that kind of thing (yes, I eat a lot of fast food, so sue me I work.. :P ) and support the typical can of pop nicely.  There are no cupholders for the two center buckets, that is a little annoying, and there could be some there for long trips where buckets are usually preferred.  In the back there are two cupholders on one side and one on the other, obviously to accomidate for the people who could potentially squeeze into the back bench.

There is a rear A/C and Radio control which is very neat.  For the radio you can control the seeking, speakers, memory stations, a few other things, and it has two headphone jacks.  Two sets of long-corded headphones thrown in with the car would have been nice as most headphones don't have that kind of extension to fit to two seats.  The speakers can be disabled so that kids in the back can listen to their music while (unfourtanately) the parents must sit in silence.  Two tuners could make this system innovative in that parents could listen to whatever makes them tick while kids go on about their own stations.  As well as the radio, the A/C system can provide heat or A/C as to your preference with the option of having the air come out the four top vents located on the left side of the rear in the van, or the two vents on the bottom.  I found the bottom vents were good after skiing and that sort of thing for warming up the feet.

The stereo system itself is fairly decent, and has sufficient bass to satisfy my needs.  My only gripe with it is that you can only turn the volume up to a certain level in the rear that is set in the front when adjusted.  We did not have the CD player installed, whether or not it was an option I cannot remember, but the casette worked nicely as far as I remember.  The big issue comes with the A/C and Heating and how the engine deals with it.  The heating is pretty good itself, yet it takes a while to warm up in the winter and I find myself giving the car extra taps on the gas to bring the engine temperature up.  However, when the air conditioning is on, I noticed a significant lack of pickup in the engine, especially when getting onto the highway at around 50 km/h.  It is because of this that I usually didn't use the air, and stuck with the windows down.  The windows are all automatic, the driver's is auto, meaning you touch the button and the driver's window goes down on its own.  I wish they'd have implemented this on all windows, as it is very convenient while trying to keep yourself concentrated on the road.

The sunroof that came with the GXE package is very nice as well.  It would have been nice should it close on its own such as the driver's window, but you have to hold the button with your hand which can be distracting sometimes while you're driving.  The sunroof is not too noisy, but it's not quiet at the same time.  I found most of the time I'd rather have it closed completely as the sun came in from up top and blinded me through the tops of my sunglasses, so I'd just have both driver and passenger windows down in the summer.

The seat configuration (i.e. moving the seats around) is fairly painless, you simply pull a latch and pull out the seat.  However, the seat itself is pretty heavy for some people so it might be wise to get someone to help you get them out (especially the rear bench) All of the seats can be removed if necessary, but we usually just removed one to take the family dog along for a trip or something along those lines.  The rear seat, when removed, offered a lot of space in the back for luggage, camping stuff, etc.  It's a very good car for hauling things around you wouldn't normally be carrying in a car.

<b>Exterior</b>

In its time, this van was something to be desired even by car owners.  Present day, it might not look that exciting but it still looks really nice compared to other vans or SUV's in my opinion, and wins hands-down against that Pontiac Aztek, yuck!

The rear hatch can be opened in two ways.  One, you can open the entire hatch all together, or you can choose to just open the glass.  I found this very useful when there was a lot of equipment stored in the back and you needed to get in top and reach for something.  The door handles are nicely designed, I like the horizontal opening ones, but they're not very common among cars & vans these days, so it's unique to have.  As I mentioned before, our van is equiped with auto seat belts in the front, and when you open the front doors, the seat belts slides forward along the track, allowing for fairly easy entry.

The headlights work fairly well, and the high beams as well.  I held a job out in the country over the summer of 2000, and needed to be there early in the morning before sunrise and after sunset, so I made use of the headlights a lot.  Sometimes I forgot that the high beams were on however, as they aren't as bright as I would expect.

<b>The Drive</b>

This van handles surprisingly better than what I had expected when I first drove it.  I imagined vans to be very slow and take long to pick up.  However, you can get this thing going when you want to!  When getting on the highway, you can really take off at times, and I surprise myself at times at how I can pass people.  I am a fairly agressive driver (inherited, I believe) so something that can handle well making quick turns and stops is essential.  Our vehicle is equipped with ABS, and works fantastic.  The winter of 2000/2001 was pretty icy, and I remember a couple times the ABS kept me from going into a slide.

I am by no means a car guy, so will not attempt to describe the engine specifications to you, but it handles gas fairly well.  I only rarely have to fill up, and even when I do it does not cost much.
