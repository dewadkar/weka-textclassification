            If you have been following my digital camera saga....I think it is finally over!  Here is a quick overview of what I have been through.  New to the digital photography world I spent some time in my local retailers trying in vein to find that perfect camera, easy to us, great photo quality, and relatively inexpensive, not too much to ask.  My first purchase was a Toshiba PDR-M60, outstanding photos but cheap casing (see my review on the PDR-M60).  I was afraid the Toshiba would break right after the warranty expired.  But what great photos!  I returned the Toshiba and purchased a Sony DSC-S30 (see my review of the DSC-S30).  The S30 has outstanding features and seemed to have a durable casing, however the picture quality was mediocre compared to the Toshiba.  I returned it and ordered a Sony DSC-S50 from an online retailer.  

I received the S50 yesterday and all I can say is WOW!  First impression, it has the same casing and features as the Sony DSC-S30 and is also able to record up to 60 sec. mpeg videos and has a higher resolution than the DSC-S30.  While I went from a $399 camera to a $600 camera I believe the DSC-S50 will be well worth the price.

So far the pictures I have taken are fantastic, comparable to the Toshiba PDR-M60, and the mpg videos are rather clear.  I am planning on using the camera quite extensively over the weekend and will fill you in next week as to my findings.  For now I have to say I am extremely happy with my new purchase.

As far as buying online...one opinion�.buyer beware!  I ordered the camera from a large online retailer &quot;thecamerazone.com&quot;, recommended by another review site.  They were advertising the camera for $489.  When I placed my order the sales agent informed me that I had to buy a special package with the camera which included an 8hr. battery and a camera case.  After my purchase of the Sony DSC-S30 I realized I needed an extra battery anyway, the one that came along with the camera just was not enough.  With the special package my price shot from $489 to $589.  Since the price of an upgraded battery at my local retailer was roughly $80.00 I thought this was not too bad of a deal and ordered the camera.  I eagerly awaited the arrival of my package.  Yesterday I got my delivery!  I opened the box and found the factory Sony box and a camera bag but no extra battery.  I contacted the company and they informed me that the battery in the factory Sony box was the battery included in their special package.  I questioned them on how the 2.5hr. factory battery be considered part of their special package?  They could not give me a clear answer; instead they decided to transfer me around from person to person.  They informed me that if I returned the camera I would be subject to a 10% restocking fee.  So at this point I am taking the issue up with my credit card company to see if they can escalate the issue.  All I really want back is the $69.97 they charged me for the extra battery they did not deliver!

Word to the wise; buy at your local retailer and save the online headache!

Look for an in-depth update on the DSC-S50 next week after I put it through it�s paces this weekend!
