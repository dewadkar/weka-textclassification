            We wanted the Audi or VW Passat, but we got a much better deal on the  SAAB 9-3. (We pay about $310 per month for a 39 month lease). We have owned the car for over 1 year so here are the things I Dislike:
1. Lack of Rear visibility
2. The door handles keep sticking (you need to pull VERY hard to open the door -- this just started happening). We talked with SAAB dealership and their reply was, &quot;Oh yeah, we have rec'd a lot of complaints about that.&quot;
3. I can't speak for other dearlers, but for our leased SAAB, we have to pay for upkeep. IT IS VERY UNCLEAR ON MY RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE UPKEEP OF THE CAR. The maintenance shop told me I MUST bring the car in at least annually for a $200 tune up. My opinion is why would I do that if I am just giving the car back to you at 39K miles. It seems as if the incentives are out of whack and I have the maintenance shop telling me I must have this done or they won't accept the car back and I have the dealer telling me the service is optional.
4. The alarm is already busted.
5. The Standard seats aren't that comfortable! No lumbar support.

Positives
1. I think we got a great deal on the car and it drives Very Nice.
2. Lots of room with the hatchback.
