            The new 360 Modena is certainly beautiful to look at and exciting to drive. 

However,  one should be cautious about certain shortcomings when it comes to buying and owning the vehicle. Anyone who has recently been in the market, knows about the long waiting list, approximately 2-3 years depending upon the dealer. Many dealers are capitalizing on the shortage of new vehicles by offering used 1999/2000 Modenas with sizable mark ups.

What they don't tell you is that the '99 cars with the F-1 transmission had many transmission
 glitches. I was in a dealership and visited their service garage and saw 3 Modenas with their engines out due to transmission fixes.

Model year 2000 Modenas are better in this regard because Ferrari changed to an updated engine management system in the middle of the year. But I've also heard that yet another problem or two with the F-1 gearbox was discovered and needs fixing.

So I guess it may not be that bad to wait the two years for a new car. You will be getting a better vehicle and will be saving money as well by not having to pay the huge mark ups. I think that any pleasure of owning the vehicle right now would be offset by the hassle of having mechanical problems needing extensive service. Who wants to go through the process of having the engine pulled from their brand new $180,000.00 sports car.

Furthermore,  I don't think I would ever think that my car was quite the same.
