            I own a Dodge Caravan.  I was told not to purchase this vehicle by people who had never owned one.  I did it any way and I am so glad.  I now have 180,000 miles on this van and still going strong.  I repaired the transmission at 120,000 miles and have no major problems since.  The interior and exterior are in excellent condition.  No paint problems that weren't brought on by people parked by me.  The cloth seats look almost new.  ENGINE!  Wow!  It drives like a dream.  The 3.3 V6 engine has a powerful take off.  It sounds like a new vehicle.  <br><br>
