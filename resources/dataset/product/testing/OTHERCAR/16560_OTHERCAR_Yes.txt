            My husband bought a 1991 Volkswagon Jetta used in 1996.  After five years, this car just keeps on going--we anticipate being able to keep it for another five years.

Any car requires regular maintenance (as well as a high ticket repair or two) once it reaches a certain age.  Since we have had the Jetta, we have had to have the exhaust, brakes, clutch, and battery replaced, as well as several smaller under-the-hood repairs.  Considering it is over ten years old, I do not consider any of these things to be unreasonable repairs.  The car has driven across country once and has had several other small trips put on it.  It has over 130K miles on it, and aside from regular oil changes and occasional additional maintenance, it is as sturdy and dependable as ever.

One item that we have had to replace several times is the exhaust pipe hanger.  It is more of an annoyance than anything else.  Because the hangers for this model and year are rubber rather than metal, they tend to break frequently (i.e. about once every 18 months), causing the exhaust to rattle loudly, especially during acceleration.  It is not dangerous for this to happen, but it is highly annoying to listen to the muffler rattle while driving down the road.  The cost for replacement is very minor--about $10 for the part and $20 for installation.  Aside from that, the car is one that we have been very happy with, and we will most likely buy another Volkswagon when we do finally retire this one.
