            For 8 years, we have had a 1986 Chevrolet Nova, which is the same as a Toyota Corolla (that year, they started making the models in collaboration). I wrote this epinion (for the Corolla) back when Chevy Nova/Prizm was not listed. Now that it is listed, I will include it here.

The car has been extremely reliable considering it's low cost and low maintenance.  As long as the car was garaged, it never had any trouble
starting. Also, for a 13 year old car, it continues to drive well with no transmission problems.

Driving the car in Colorado, it was only a slight problem in the  mountains and deep snow. But then again, driving a 1986 four cylinder is not the smartest idea.

I would strongly recommend the car for anyone buying a first car,
or for someone who wants an reliable car for a low price. And, of
course, I would not recommend the car to someone doing a lot of  snow driving.

Corollas aren't too expensive to begin, but furthermore, they are
a great investment since they hardly depreciate. I think over the
last 6 years or so, my car has only depreciated about $1000!

Good luck!<br><br>
