            I love my Saturn.  I bought a 1998 Saturn SL1 and have not regreted it once.  Ever since I saw the commercials on TV about the no haggling sales people at Saturn I wanted to look at them.  My husband and I went to the dealership to look and we were greeted by the nicest sales people.  We test drove a car and fell in love.  I bought a stick shift and it's very easy to drive smooth shifting into gears.  They didn't have the color car we wanted with all the features we wanted so the salesman who sold us the car found one in Los Angeles and personally drove up there to get it for us and drove it back to San Diego so I could have it the next day.  My car is now two years old and I still love it!  It still drives very good shifts very smooth and I haven't had anything go wrong with the car.  We drive it from San Diego to Las Vegas about every 4 months and every time the car preforms perfect.  It gets GREAT gas mileage.  I really can't think of anything I hate about the car.  I think anyone should buy this car.  It's  good car for first time new car buyers.<br><br>
