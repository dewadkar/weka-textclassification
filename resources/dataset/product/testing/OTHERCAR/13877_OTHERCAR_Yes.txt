            It's going on two years since I purchased my Hyundai Excel Hatchback and I have to admit, it hasn't been a terrific experience yet I like the little car.

Right off the bat, I noticed the rear defroster didn't work at all.  Since it was summer time when I got the car, I didn't bother getting it fixed until halfway through the winter of 1998 when I was so totally frustrated with not being able to see out the back window.  To add insult to injury, even after being fixed it still didn't work all that well.  And it's been that way to this day.  The rear window just doesn't want to stay clear no matter how long the rear defroster is left on.

Outside of this annoyance, my Hyundai Excel isn't really a bad car.  It does get around 25 to 30 miles to the gallon depending on which octane gas is used.  There is some vibration when driving above 65 miles per hour, but I never speed.  No sir.

The Hyundai Excel is a decent car at a decent price.  Be careful when choosing it though as some cars are in worse condition than others, but that goes for all used cars.<br><br>
