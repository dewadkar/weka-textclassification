            2003 GMC Sierra 1500 4x4 Extended Cab Short Bed SLT

I bought this truck to replace a 2001 Toyota Tacoma DoubleCab V6.  The Toyota was a great combination of interior room, enough truck bed for me, mileage, and utility.  

Once I started commuting over an hour each way every day, I quickly learned that I was missing many creature comforts that would be nice with that much time spent in the car, as well as I began to develop some tailbone pain, I think due to the hard flat seats on the Toyota.

I began the search for a new vehicle and was torn between an SUV and a truck.  I decided that I would kick myself later if I didn't have a truck bed when I needed one.  Then I made a list of trucks that would have comfortable seats.  This included the Sierra, Silverado, Ram, F150, and the Dakota.

I did some preliminary hunting on line at carpoint.com and carsdirect.com, and compared the new versions of each with 1999-2001 models.  

I liked the F150 CrewCab for the same reasons I liked the Tacoma DoubleCab, but the look of the truck is tired and everyone has them.  

I liked the Ram's heavy duty look but after sitting in one at the dealer I felt the seats, even leather, were not up to the standard I felt I needed.

I checked out the Silverado and really liked what it had to offer.  I decided to look for a used one because I HATE the new 2003 front ends on them.  Once I dug up the details on the 2003 models I felt that there were enough cool new features to look at buying a new one, but instead of a Chevy I would look at the GMC, which had also undergone a minor facelift for 2003 but its much nicer looking than the Silverado.

So that was it, a new 2003 Sierra.  The 1500 Extended Cab is plenty of room for me.  With the SLT package the super comfy front leather seats and a host of creature comforts are included.  I was set.  

The options I got are:
SLT package
Z71 package
5.3L engine
Full feature front seats
6 Disc Changer & Bose stereo
Fender flares
Tow package
Fun exterior mirrors
Camper wiring harness (didn't really want it)
Trailering selection for different shifting (didn't really want it)
Carbon Metallic exterior
Dark Pewter interior

<b>Exterior:</b>
The color is beautiful.  Its almost black, and people seem to love it.  This was the one option I let my wife choose.  Its very nice.  The new front end is less stylish, in my opinion than the last version, but the change is minimal and it still looks nice.  I like the fact that the package came with daytime running lights and fog lights, something you have to pay for in other trucks.

The heated rear view mirrors have many nice conveniences.  The driver side auto-dims at night to reduce glare (and the interior rear view, so it WOULD be nice it the passenger side one did too, but it does not).  They also have a small light underneath that shines when the remote unlock is pressed.  Nice for safety and convenience.  One or both mirrors can also be set to angle down when you go into reverse, allowing you to view the curb or parking spot lines.  Finally, you can magically fold both mirrors in at the touch of a button for tight parking spots and garages like mine!

I am disappointed that the "off-road" package comes with such wimpy tires.  My TRD Tacoma had very cool BFG Long Trail's.  These Firestone's look like something off an Oldsmobile.  Also, I think GMC's wheels are terribly ugly.  But all that can and will be changed eventually.

Otherwise on the exterior there is nothing bad or good...very nice looking truck overall.

<b>Interior:</b>
The seats are heaven.  Just what I needed.  I have had no back pain since I started commuting in this baby.  Both seats are 6 way power adjustable, well heated (3 levels and back or no back), have armrests, lumbar and side bolster support and nice cushy leather.  

The back seat is vinyl, but looks like leather and who cares anyway, noone is ever back there.  The seat folds up to reveal plenty of storage underneath.  

The center console is very nice.  With the seat package it goes all the way up to the dashboard and includes 2 nice cupholders and a couple of differently sizes storage areas, two storage pockets toward the front, two 12v sources, a non-slide coated console lid for dropping things on while you drive, and a relatively well sized console interior.  Under the console is the Bose 5 1/4" subwoofer, which is hidden.  On the back of the console is an adjustable A/C duct for each back seat rider, fold up cupholder, and a small storage pocket.

The stereo is a 6 disc in dash changer.  Quite nice I must say.  With 4 Bose speakers and 2 tweeters, and the sub, it really, REALLY sounds good.  Much better than any factory car system I have heard.  Very well balanced from highs to lows.  My only gripe is the small subwoofer.  I would have liked to see them place a 6.5" or 8" in there just to round it out nicer.  I mean, if you are going to put a sub in there, do it up right!  I have the bass turned up to 9 and its great.  Could be a bit punchier though.  Like I said though, the stereo sounds really great.  It plays CDR's with no problems and has all the controls you need on the steering wheel, which rules!

The dash is well laid out, all the controls within easy reach.  The tranny handle is kind of in the way of the stereo and AC but not enough to be a big deal.  There are all the normal gauges and a driver info center which has about 20 settings for the truck and tons of mileage/MPG/trip/ type functions.  It even has a timer.  Why?  Who knows but it takes me 72 minutes to get to work sometimes!  The settings are great...tell it how to respond when you lock and unlock with the remote (horn, lights), if the mirrors should tilt in reverse, when to lock and unlock the doors, if the headlights should stay on upon exit, when to adjust the seat for you...on and on.

The memory feature is great.  Based on if remote 1 or 2 unlocks the doors it will set your seat position, radio stations, AC temp and rear view mirror positions.  Or you can press the 1 or 2 when in park.  Also you can have a seat exit position for when you turn the key off so its easier to exit.

The dual zone AC is super, since my wife is always cold, and I am not.  The controls take a few trips to get used to, but it works very well.  My only feeling is that when I am in there alone, if I adjust my temp, I feel the need to adjust the passenger one as well as I don't want that hot/cold air to effect mine!  

The truck rides so smooth...the engine is so quiet I can barely hear it, and the tranny shifts without much of a trace.  It really is a pleasure to drive.  I have been getting close to 18mpg to work and back which is about 3/5 freeway and 2/5 in town driving (44 miles one way) and am at 16.2mpg overall and climbing.  Keep in mind I am consciously trying to go easy on the gas most of the time.  Once its broken in I think i'll average over 17mpg full time.  Pretty good. It also has 4 wheel disc brakes, a nice standard feature for a big heavy vehicle.  

<b>Conclusion:</b>
As you can tell i really like this truck.  It has many creature comforts and is way beyond all my past vehicles in style, comfort, convenience, and utility.  

By the way I bought through Carsdirect.com for $100 under invoice   a GM $2000 rebate, placing it at about $30,400 before tax, etc.  Retail was over $37,000.  Carsdirect was an EXCELLENT buying experience.  I highly recommend it.
