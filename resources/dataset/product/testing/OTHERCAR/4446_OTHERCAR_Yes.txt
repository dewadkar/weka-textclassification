            I'm Gonna keep this short and sweet people.  

If you are looking for an elegant, well appointed coupe, the Acura CL is hard to beat.

This car drives just as well as the day I drove it off the dealers lot.  The 6 cylinder engine is every bit as smooth and powerful as day one. And the transmission shifts with the very same smooth, crisp linearity as well. I just can't believe how refined, and reliable this car has been. Until this car, I did not quite get the whole Honda loyalty thing, but I do now.

The car has also worn very well as far as interior appointments go. The seats are still comfortable, and really ideal for long driving. If you are looking for a roomy interior, this car does really well as far as a 2 door goes. If you like 4 door room however, stick with 4 doors. 

I've had this car for 5 years now, and it has given me no trouble at all. NONE! I have had this car in for oil changes and a new battery, and that's it. And by the way, the local Acura dealer has been amazing in service. I've owned a few of the high bill German autos, and they do not compare in overall reliabilty or ultimate service. Period. 

I'm not excessively hard on cars, but I believe they should be driven, and my CL has seen an average of 15,000 miles per year, so it is driven well. With 200 horsepower on tap, this car can be FUN to drive, but what it does best is pamper you in your travels. It has done this for me for 5 years, and I honestly expect it to do so for another 5.
