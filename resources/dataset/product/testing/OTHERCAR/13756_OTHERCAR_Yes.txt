            I started looking for a larger car after we got our second German Shepherd.  With two large dogs to transport I needed enough space to transport them and their stuff.  So after a lot of research on safety issues I started test driving different vehicles.  I tried several SUV&#146s and a couple of different vans.  I had owned a Mountaineer in the past and wasn't really satisfied with it.  I was really impressed with the Caravan.  You sit high enough that you can see what is going on around you but you don&#146t feel like you need a ladder to climb in.  I really like the duel sliding doors and the removable seats. However if you remove a seat make sure you have someone there to help you, I could release it but was not strong enough to remove the seat by myself.  With the large sliding doors I can easily get my dog crates in and out.  Also with the zone controls for the heat I can set the temp cooler in the back for the dogs.  What really impressed me though was the mileage with combined city and highway I&#146m averaging 22 mpg.  I was afraid with the size of the van the mileage would not be nearly that good.  I was pleased with the handling of the van on ice and snow people around me were slipping and sliding and the van maneuvered like a champ.  It did take a little more stopping time but that is to be expected on ice.  This is the first vehicle that my husband and I have owned that we both like.  The only thing I would recommend is to get mud flaps for it as it does throw the road gunk on itself.
