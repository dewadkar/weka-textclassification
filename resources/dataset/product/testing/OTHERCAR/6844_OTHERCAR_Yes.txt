            I recently began the search for the classic "family sedan", and started shopping. The contenders, you certainly know them: Camry, Accord, Mazda 626 and VW Passat.

We test drove them all within a week, and I'm pleased to report the the Mazda 626 was a very pleasurable drive, certainly keeping pace with its more popular and well-known competitors.

I've always liked the looks of the Mazda 626. The body style is classy, even, dare-I-say Jaguar-esque? Perhaps that's going too far for a "family sedan", but nonetheless, the 626 always turns my head, and gives me an impression of elegance. 

The interior of the 626 is certainly comfortable, but a little less refined. This is mostly from the materials quality, which don't give off the luxury feeling that the exterior exudes. But what do you expect? After all, this car can be had for less than $20k.

Though not posh, the 626's interior certainly has everything you really need. A nice, comfortable drivers seat with firm, comfy back support. A good-looking, well laid out dash that is available with fake wood trim. All the options that you need, and then some. How about leather seats? A moon roof? etc. etc. You can have it all on your 626, and it will be cheaper than the others.

Yes, the Mazda has a swing feature for its air vents. Some people love it, but I found it kind of strange and a little distracting. Neither a positive or a negative for the car.

The one drawback of the 626's design for me was the height of the back seat. The car feels a little lower than some of the competition, esp. the Passat. Since kids are hopefully in our future, I imagined myself sticking my upper body in the back to get a little one in and out of a car seat. It felt a little tight, and I practiced this move in all the cars we drove. Minor drawback, but worth consideration in our case.

The 626 drives and handles well. However, the 4 cylinder 626 is definitely underpowered and you will feel it when you try to enter the highway. The groan of the engine can be annoying, but the car is certainly functional. On the other hand, the v6 engine performed admirably. Both cars, however, gave off a good bit of engine and road noise. This is the category where they fall behind the ultra-quiet Camry, and semi-quiet Accord. This was the ultimate factor that eliminated the 626 from our prospect list. I've driven a Plymouth Neon for 7 years and want to stop the noise! 

However, every car will give road and wind noise to a degree. Better soundproofing on the 626 would really improve this car.

Overall, the 626 is a viable competitor in the family sedan arena. With a little more sound control, this car could be a real winner, and a substantial value.  

---------------------------------
P.S. In case you're wondering, we ended up NOT buying an Accord or Camry either. The car of choice was an Acura 3.2 TL. It's a more expensive ride, and it falls into the near-luxury category, but boy is it quiet : )
