            The car being reviewed here is a 2003 Toyota Camry XLE V6.  The Camry really needs no introduction, on and off for the last 6 odd years it has been the best selling car in America, and still in the top 10 for poorer Canada.  A mid-size car that is almost ideally suited to being a family car, the Camry's biggest fault is that it doesn't offer much driver entertainment.  Still, the Camry has an amazing reputation for reliability, as can be seen in the countless pre-1990 Camrys driving around.  Toyota really finishes their cars much better than other automakers, and its very obvious in its cars today.  The paint job shimmers and shines well beyond anything in its class, as does the exterior fit and finish.  The interior too, is constructed of great-looking plastics that at times resemble rough leather.  My only complaint here is that in our older 1997 XLE V6 Camry and previous Lexuses (Lexi?) Toyota used an excellent quality plastic for the upper portion of the dash and doors, which they don't use anymore.  Anyways, in terms of quality and reliability, you can't go wrong.  
     The new 4-cylinder on the Camry is much improved: smoother, with more power at all RPMs.  I have the V6, so let me tell you a little bit about that.  You can find the specs anywhere, but let me point a couple of details out.  Although this is an incredibly smooth engine (smoother than Accord's V6, and MUCH smoother than Nissan's 3.5 VQ V6), they have a better version of it that they're not using.  There's a new 3.3L version of this engine used in the new Sienna and RX330, which is not only bigger and more powerful (with no loss in fuel economy), but also has variable valve timing which has a significant impact on drivability.  The VVTi engines also used active liquid-filled engine mounts that make it smoother still.  At this point, Toyota should have at least the VVTi engine, if not a new, more powerful one, since all its competitors are now at 240 hp or more.  And since this Camry is heavier and bigger, its also slower.  It no longer has the power to weight ratio to get it to 60 mph in 7.7 seconds like the last Camry.  It now takes around 8.4 seconds, and the difference is VERY noticeable.  If you're not the takeoff type, then you won't mind a nearly-silent and smooth engine that this car has.
     The suspension on this Camry is well done for the type of market they wanted to go after.  Very, very smooth.  It absorbs bumps of all sizes without letting you feel or hear (well, this is partly the tires) them.  Somehow, Toyota manages to get the geometry right such that these cars can actually handle well.  Now, it won't feel like it, because the car has a fair amount of body roll, and the soft, compliant suspension can feel floaty during sporty manouvres, but on the skidpad these cars actually pull high g's.  For example, the cushy Lexus LS430 pulls 0.87 g, the same as BMW's M3 (punishing ride) and MORE than the M5.  Well, Toyota has the highest R&D budget of any automaker.  It shows. 
      The cabin is spacious and comfortable, both front and rear.  Toyota managed to increase the height without making it look weird like the Echo (and to some extent, the Focus, Matrix etc.).  There is little wind noise even at 175 km/h, at which speed the V6 just starts ripping.  I know the last generation model had a top speed of around 141 mph, i dunno about this one.  Basically, decked out in leather and faux wood (why can't they use the real thing?) it looks suitably luxorious.  I've had people mistake my silver one for a Lexus (obviously they weren't car enthusiasts, but still!).  
      Overall, the Camry is a great car, if a bit expensive.  But if you can afford it, you should get it.
