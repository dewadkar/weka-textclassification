            My 1993 Dodge Intrepid was my very first BRAND NEW car!  I was so excited.  When I drove it off of the car dealer's lot, it had a mere 14 miles on it.  My excitement very soon turned to disappointment and dismay.  <br><br>Since I purchased my Intrepid in 1993 it has been to dealer for repairs 17 times!  Yes, that's right -- 17 times!  Six of those 17 times, my car had to be towed in to the dealer.  Fortunately, I purchased the extended warranty that covered my car for 7 years or 100,000 miles.  Below is a list of some of the major items that needed repaired:<br><br>1.  Transmission -- this had to be replaced at 30,000 miles<br>2.  Brakes - the dealer installed 3 whole sets of brakes within the first 6 months<br>3.  Computer - the main computer chip that runs the whole system went out<br>4.  Tie rod ends - Fortunately these did not break when I was actually driving <br>5.  Cooling system - the car frequently overheated leaving me stranded<br>6.  Paint - the paint is peeling off the &quot;C-panels&quot; <br><br>I chose the Intrepid not only  because of the sleek style and the comfortable interior, but the long-standing reliability of Dodge products. Also, at that time the rebates, etc. they were offering were very economically appealing.  I shopped around and decided I was getting the most for my money with the Intrepid.<br><br>I really loved driving this car.  It rode so smooth.  The interior is so roomy and comfortable.  I liked the large trunk and some of the &quot;little&quot; extras, like the interior lighting system.<br><br>What I hated about this car is all the repairs it needed. Obviously, I got a lemon.  Although, other Intrepid owners were experiencing the same problems that I had.<br><br>I would not recommend this vehicle to someone who drives long distances because it is too unreliable.  Never again will I buy a first year model.<br><br><br><br><br>
