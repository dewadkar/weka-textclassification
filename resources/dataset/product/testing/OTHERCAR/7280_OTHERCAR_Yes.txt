            This is my second Olympus digital camera.  My last one was a sub 1 megapixel model.  I had two complaints with it - what I saw through the view finder was not reflective of what I captured (much wider angle capture) and the colors were a bit cold.  However, it did provide sharp pictures.

The 460Z is a good camera that provides many features - many useful, some not (e.g. various color balance options depending on ambient light). The 3X optical zoom is great and the view finder is fairly reflective of what is captured.  The color rendition is also good.

In terms of battery consumption, I got a lot of mileage out of the lithium batteries (disposable) that were included.  I have not had enough experience to comment on alkalines.

I have not actually downloaded pictures directly from the camera as I have opted to use a USB smartmedia card reader which is very fast.

The most annoying feature of the camera is that it is nearly impossible to take action shots because 1) there is a significant delay between when the shutter button is pressed and when the picture is captured, and 2) one has no control over the shutter speed.

With this 1.3 megapixel camera, I have found that enlargements to 8x10 are good.  However, with the rate at which these cameras drop in price, I would consider getting the Olympus D-490 Zoom (2.1 megapixel) which now does not cost a lot more.

All in all, though this camera offers many useful options, good quality images, at a reasonable price.
