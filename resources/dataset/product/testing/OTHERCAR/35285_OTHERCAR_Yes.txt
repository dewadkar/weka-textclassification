            Well, here is my review on the 1996 Mitsubishi Galant S Model sedan.

It's good I am writing this now and not a couple years ago at this time.  

My wife and I bought a silver Galant almost two years from today's date.  We were just looking for a four door car and my wife was familiar with the Galant since her parents had one and she learned to drive on it.  

We purchased the car at a big name dealership and rushed the decision quite a bit.  For the first month, it sat at the dealership after they finally found the problem in the transmission and replaced it with another transmission.

It had 60k miles on it when we bought it ... upper 60's.

It has been a fairly good car for us.  However, I did have trouble with the belts.  The belts kept coming off so I went out and bought all new belts and put them on, but it still did it.  Well, it was only a couple weeks later that I discovered the problem was the crankshaft pulley.  The pulley was wobbling and then broke off altogether.  This as well as an oxygen sensor had to be replaced.  So this experience as well as the other experience with the transmission.

The features are nice and work well: a/c, cruise, etc.

The car is actually pretty roomy for both the front and back seat and you can put quite a bit in the trunk as well.

I have had a car that was worse mechanically but I also have one that is better.

It would be a mediocre buy, but definitely have it checked out before purchasing.
