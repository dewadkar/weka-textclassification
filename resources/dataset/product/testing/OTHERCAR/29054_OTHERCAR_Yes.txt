            If you are willing to shell out the 80,000 for the Porsche you probably shouldn�t worry about the maintenance costs but they are something else.  Just to give you an idea of some of the problems I�ve run into with a car a friend lent to me.

-The tires only last 12,000 miles and finding replacements is a big problem.  On the Carrerra I had, the tires on the back wheels were worn down and also got nails stuck in them before I replaced them at 11,000 miles.  This was because the tires are wider than normal car tires so pick up more stuff on the rode.  Then find replacement tires for the Porche was a disaster.   The tires were Pirelli�s that had sold out in every place in north America so what I had to do was change all four tires on the car at cost of a thousand dollars.

-also I have had some problems with the sun roof on the car.  When open it would let out a whirring sound.  It took two visit�s to Barrier Motors (the snooty Porsche dealership in Seattle) to get it fixed and by that time there was a problem with door lock. 

Now those problems aside the car is amazing�. It is like riding a horse with it�s own personality
