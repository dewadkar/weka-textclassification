              I purchased a 99 cougar in September of 99.  I have had a number of unnecessary problems.  Within the first six months the paint started chipping, so I purchased touch-up paint at the dealership.  Then the felt on the dash started peeling off so they had to replace the felt.  Instrument cluster lenses cracked.  The dealership ordered a new cluster which took nine months because it was on back order.  When they replaced it the miles were wrong, the rpm tach was wrong, trip odometer was not accurate, all worked fine before replacing it.  
  After having 48,000 miles on the car the sunroof's track had to be replaced ($1800).  Getting it to the dealership was a problem because the starter no longer worked.  When I brought it there they also told me that there was a recall on the brakes, they would lock up anytime.  
  With the experience that I've had I do not recommend this vehicle to anyone.  <br><br>
