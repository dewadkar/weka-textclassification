            The idea of a small camera that you can carry in your pocket is very cool. The fact that you can attach it to your computer and edit the pictures is very cool. The fact that you can email your pictures to others is very cool.

All these concepts are great the this product is an example how concept is different from reality. The marketing idea is great. It's cheap and it holds many pictures. The main problem here is the quality. The camera simply doesn't take good pictures. It needs VERY good lighting, and I mean California sunlight calibur lighting. Sometimes that's not even good enough. If lighting is not the problem, it's the quality. The resolution is very low, even the special "XVGA" resolution is just terrible. The pictures all look washed out with the colors looking all messed up and pixelated. Granted it comes with software so you can adjust the sharpness and lighting, but no amount of editing will make the pictures look good and it's really not your job to compensate for the lack of picture quality. 

Don't even bother with movie mode, it's just downright pathetic. Not only does the video resemble the still picture quality, the frame rate is nowhere near smooth enough to watch. 

Last thing, when you take a picture, there is this annoying beep that occurs when you successfully take a picture. I have yet figured out how to turn this off and the instructions don't say anything about it. The last thing you want while taking pictures during a wedding or graduation ceremony is a beep after every picture.
