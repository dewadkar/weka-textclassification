            My wife and I purchased this camera because we had a baby on the way, and knew we'd be taking lots of pictures.  We had professional pictures done by a photographer, but our friends and family think the pictures we've made with this camera (had pics printed by Shutterfly.com) were superior.  My wife took pictures at her sister's wedding, and her sister is now ordering all her prints from what we took, not what the wedding photographer took.  Many of my friends are looking into getting this camera now, its done everything we've wanted and more.  It has 2x optical zoom, and 4x digital.  I use a 96Mb CF card in mine, which will get around 158 pictures with the normal settings.  The 1600x1200 is enough for 8x10 prints (which we've done).  Its also rather rugged, it been thrown into bags, and dropped on the floor, with no problems.  I recommend getting the rechargeable battery, as it does eat them rather quickly when using the view screen.  For the best quality pics, a stand would be nice also.<br><br>
