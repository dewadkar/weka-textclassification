            I have been driving my RAV4 for 3 years. About 6 month ago, a Suburban (a large SUV) hit me broadside on the passenger side. I was wearing my seat and shoulder belts. I received only a few scratches from broken window glass.  Witnesses to the accident were surprised that I was not hurt and that the vehicle did not roll over.  What I saying is that it is a safe SUV. 
I am a small person and bought it because I sat higher in the RAV4, and felt I had better visibility in traffic.  It has a very tight turning radius, making it easy to park.  I average 29 mpg in mixed city/highway driving. 
One thing that I do not like about the RAV4, and other Toyota cars, is the seat comfort. There is none. The seats are hard, this is especially troubling on long trips. After about 1 hour, sitting is unbearable.   
Another issue with the 2 door model I drive, is that there is a large blind spot on the driver's side from the roof column.  
I would recommend a cruise control for distance driving to avoid foot cramp.
