               Several years ago I purchased my first Nissan Hardbody pickup. It was a used 1986 model with 173k miles on it. I bought it from the company I was working for at the time and it had been serviced on a regular basis. I kept this truck for two years and never had to put a drop of oil in it other than regular oil and filter changes. When I sold the truck I had 260k miles on it with very few minor problems.
   I have since purchased another used Nissan pickup with high mileage and have had the same results. Great gas mileage, no oil burning and easy maintenance. What a great truck! The only real problems I had with either truck is with the electric fuel pump. The original factory fuel pumps are prone to failure and are powered through a relay that can also cause problems. In both cases I replaced the OEM pump with a second source pump and experienced no further problems.
   Want a great used truck with low maintenance and potential for long life find yourself a Nissan that you can verify has been well maintained and you will make yourself a happy camper!<br><br>
