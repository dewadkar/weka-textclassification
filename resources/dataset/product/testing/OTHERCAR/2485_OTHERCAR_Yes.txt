            I am a college student that owns a 1995 Hyundai Elantra, and what I have to say about this car is that it is the ideal car for a college student to own.  (especially one who attends school in states such as Florida where owning a car is essential.  The principal reason why i purchased this car was because of how economical it was. It costs less than $5000, and did not look like it did.


  Upon owning the car there were a few things that i discovered.  for one this car has good gas mileage.  My Elantra is a five speed standard and averages out about 350 miles on a full tank.  A full tank being about 8-10 gallons of gas.  Another thing that i have discovered about this car is its reliability.

  I have driven this car from Florida to New York and New York to Florida three times and it is still in perfect running shape despite the fact that is has 100,000+ miles on it. 

 I strongly recommend this car to anyone who is looking for an affordable car the looks good and does not require you to buy a gas station along with it.<br><br>
