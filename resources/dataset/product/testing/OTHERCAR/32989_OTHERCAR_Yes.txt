            I simply can�t say enough about the 2001 GMC Yukon.  I owned a 1999 GMC Yukon, and the differences between the two are enormous.  To the 2001 Yukon�s credit, as good of a car as the 1999 Yukon was, the 2001 is about a hundred times better.  GMC did a great job of improving the 1999 Yukon�s weaknesses into a SUV that I consider to be the best on the road.
First, I felt that the 1999 Yukon�s sound system was a little shaky: the speakers would often rattle and easily get �blown out.�  In the 2001 Yukon, it seems as if there is a custom sound system in my car- the sound is great and the speakers are durable.  
Second, the 1999 Yukon was big, but didn�t have the comfort I look for in an SUV.  The 2001 Yukon is both spacious and the seats are perfect for long road trips.  I can easily fit 5 of my biggest friends in it comfortably for hours on the road.  Another perk about the interior, it has all the space and technology to install DVD players, flat screen TV�s, and navigational systems.  In our day and age, I feel this is a must, especially if you�re traveling with young children who need to be entertained.  The last thing I noticed about the inside was the spacious cargo room.  Without cramming luggage, it is easy to fit up to 5 large sized bags in the back.
Aside for the luxury inside and sleek design outside, it packs some power in the engine.  This beast seems to be able to tow anything.  I own a boat, and the 2001 GMC Yukon can tow it fully loaded, without affecting it�s handling and controls.  It�s nice to be able to enjoy a weekend on the lake even on the car trips to and from it!
With all the good things about the 2001 GMC Yukon, I think it�d be hard to not buy it.  All of it�s advantages will set you ahead of the other SUV�s out on the road.  Personally, it was one of my best investments as a car owner.
