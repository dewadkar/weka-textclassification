            My husband and I look at quite a few trucks before deciding on the 2000 Chevy extended cab truck.  It is rugged enough for &quot;mountain driving&quot; but comfortable for driving around town.  It pulls our 26ft travel trailer with ease in up 8% grades with no problem.  These are just a few of the reasons my husband loves the truck.

On the other hand, I like appreciate the finer things in life such as the wonderful CD player and sound system that it was equipped with.  Also, the air conditioner helps a lot.  The extra room that the extended cab and third door allow for the kids is great and is much more comfortable than the older models.  There is finally some &quot;leg space&quot; for them which creates a nicer ride all around.

We bought the vehicle for several reasons.  The extra door on the passenger side of the extended cab and the extra leg space for the kids was a big part of the decision.  Also, the power that this Chevy puts out pulling our travel trailer was the deciding factor and we are very glad that we bought this truck.  It is truly a Great Truck!<br><br>
