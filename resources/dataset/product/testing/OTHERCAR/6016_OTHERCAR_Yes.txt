            With our first child on the way, we decided that more space was in order. Since we are Volvo fanatics (this is our third since 1982), the choice wasn't what car, but which Volvo. We purchased this used in 1998 for $27,000 instead of the V70's and before the V40 was available (which was too small anyway.) We wanted minivan space and utility without having to drive a minivan. We thought of an SUV, but found that a similar interior space required a rather large SUV and priced it out of our range. We were also not thrilled at the crash performance of most small to mid-size SUV's.
There is much to love about this wagon. The seats are probably the best in the world. Very supportive, large and comfortable, heated and fully power adjustable with memory. The driving position is very car-like and visiblity is great. I feel the engine is the best one ever put out by Volvo. Yes this is a bold statement. I have driven almost every version of engine Volvo has made. Yes, the 5 cylinder turbo is more powerful, yes the 4 cylinder 2.3l is probably more durable. The nest closest would be the light pressure 5 cylinder available on most V70's now. But this in-line 6 cylinder engine is silky smooth, comparable to the BMW 2.8 inline 6. It has great take-off power from a standstill and will wind smoothly all the way to redline.  Highway power for acceleration and passing is great. The downside is that you will find yourself on the highway doing 80 and not realize it. But that is the sign of a great car. When you do not feel you are going as fast as your are. OK, enough about the engine.
Seating is generous. The rear is great on headroom, but a little tight on legroom for larger adults. 5 adults would be crowded. The rear seat does split 60/40 (really more like 66/33) allow some longer cargo to easily be tucked away in the back. The rear hatch opens tall enough for this 6'3&quot; man to stand under (which saves a Lot on the headache department!) It also works great as a tailgate area as the hatch opens to cover the rear opening entirely so you can sit on the tailgate with the hatch open while it is raining and not get wet (a minor point, but it does come in handy.)
Styling is definitely Volvo, but I think very classy and subtle. You will have no issues selling this car (if you could ever part with it.)
Transmission is very smooth with standard winter/power/economy shift programming.  Winter mode starts the car in a higher gear under bad weather conditions. With the rear-wheel drive of the car it is necessary, and works like a charm.
Rear storage is ample, can accommodate a third child seat, and is very accessible for large square or bulky items. The loading height is comfortable and completely flat.
Overall drive quality is great. This wagon was meant to be driven on long highway trips (having taken this from Baltimore to Boston and back over 10 times I can vouch for that.) It is a pleasure on long distance trips.)

OK, OK.  Now the bad news. I can be honest and say there are a few. Fuel mileage is not the greatest. I get get about 17 city and 22 Highway (on really long trips), but the 21 gallon gas tank does help the range (but filling it lately has required a home-equity loan.) Styling for the interior, though it may be called classic, has changed very little from the 1989 760 that it replaced. If you are a Volvo fan, you will feel right at home, but for others it may seem too subdued. Over 60% of the wagons had a charcoal interior (like mine) and it gets HOT in the sun and summertime. The A/C is adequate to get the cabin back to normal, but it is something to consider. Repair and maintenance are going to be more expensive than average, but that may be simply due to the Volvo brand than anything else. In 20,000 miles I have had it in for oil and lube and that is it. Lastly, some of the dash control are mounted below and to the side of the steering wheel. They are almost impossible to see without moving you head around the wheel, but are easy to access (once you learn where they are it is easy to activate the switches from memory). 

To drive, this wagon is VERY car-like. It has a great turning radius (better than most Front wheel drive cars) and is easy to parallel park. The wheelbase makes for a very comfortable drive. European influence is present in tight steering, firm suspension and a highway attitude of this car. You will forget you are in a wagon.

Who should buy this? Well, if you are looking for a luxury car, but need the extra space. You travel a lot of long trips and want to get there in style and comfort. You have kids and need a grocery getter that you can take to soccer meets, swim meets and still go to town in. Lastly, and by no means least. If you want to put your family in a vehicle that they can survive a disasterous crash in, this is the one. After watching crash tests from SUV's, minivans and Outbacks, I could not be more secure about the choice I made to put my wife and daughter in. I will be happy with this wagon until my daughter is out of school. It was a great choice.<br><br>
