            I bought this vehicle after talking to a freind who owned at the time a 93 saturn wagon. He drove from pittsbutgh to new york city in it on almost a weekly basis. In his words he &quot;USED&quot; his saturn quite well meaning he took care of normal maintenace but never babied it. Well as i was deciding to look at a saturn wagon i asked him about how much he had invested in his. In 5 years he has changed oil every 3/3,000 religiously and put (1) set of brakes on. I asked him the miles he had on it and we both looked. He had 136,000 on it at the time! That made me decide that saturn made a good vehicle.

I loved the no pressure way they sell cars. I had to ask for everything. No push sales. No salesperson nagging, No trips to see the manager, no bull what so ever. I bought this car in under 1 hour total! Total satisfaction.

The car drives very nice. Tracks well and doesn't seem like its going to fall apart when you are doing 65 mph on the interstate. The &quot;WORST&quot; gas milage i have ever got was 31 mpg! Mu only complaint is a minor one. I'm not a small person at 6'3&quot; but i still manage to fit in there and i can drive for a few hours before being to cramped. But anything short of a pickuptruck is too small for taller drivers anyways!

I highly recomend this vehicle to anyone who wants dependability/great service/no hassle and reasonable priced auto!<br><br>
