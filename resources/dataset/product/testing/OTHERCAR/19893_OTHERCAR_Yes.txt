            I bought my Montero Sport LS last week, and have had a great time since I got it.  Everyone at the Mistubishi dealer was very kind, and it did not take very long.  The car is an LS version, which includes power everything, AM FM CD player, folding rear seats, all time four wheel drive.

The vehicle sounds great driving down the road.  The noises of the road can barely be heard inside.  It handles nicely also.  It has a somewhat "Trucky" feel over bumps, but it surprised me how sturdy the vehicle felt.  I have yet to drive the vehicle in snowy conditions, but it has handled great in the rain.  No slipping, no skidding.

The sounds system in the vehicle is pretty nice, it has a 6 speaker system CD player, which can still be heard clearly when turned up loud.

The seats in the back fold down and provide a very large space for cargo.  It can easily hold many bikes in the back, with some room to spare.  The back door opens up, making loading and unloading very easy.

It also came with a full size spare tire, fully tinted rear windows, side step beams, a cargo rack on the roof, and many more features.

All in all, I would say this is a great vehicle for the sporty type of person, who wants a car to last them for a while.  I would also recommend the vehicle to college students... it is very safe and very reliable.  It came with a 6 year 100000 mile warranty on all parts, and 6 year/100000 mile roadside assistance.

(The Model says 2002, but its really a 2003!)
