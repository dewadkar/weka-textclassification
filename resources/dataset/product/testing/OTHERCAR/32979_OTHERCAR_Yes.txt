            My mother bought a new 1997 Toyota Camry shortly before I got my driver's license in 1996.  She was going to give me her Ford Taurus, so she needed a new car for herself.  At first, she debated about getting another Taurus, but she decided against it because she didn't like the current body style.  She wanted something that looked more low-key and refined.  Also, safety and reliability were of utmost importance to her.  She did a lot of research on various makes and models, and finally decided on the Toyota Camry, since it ranked the best in its class at the time.

I haven't had too many opportunities to drive this car.  Because of my terrible driving record, my mother's insurance company decided they won't cover any kind of damage to the Camry caused by my driving.  However, the few times I did get to drive it were a pleasure.  It had, and still has, a very smooth, gentile ride.  The engine is quiet; sometimes you forget the car is on when it is in park.  

There were a few small problems with this car.  The driver's door lock would stick, and have to be unlocked manually.  This problem was fixed, however.  Also, every time after the car is serviced, (regular maintenance) the Toyota mechanics almost always forget to put a cap back on the car, and the engine makes a slight ticking sound.  This happened many times, so now my mother always reminds them when she drops the car off, and it hasn't happened since.  One other annoyance is the alarm system.  It would have cost $200 more to get the remote for the dealer-installed alarm, so my mother opted against it, thinking it was unnecessary.  So, in order to &quot;disarm&quot; the alarm, you need to turn the key in the ignition within 15 seconds of opening the car door or the alarm will go off.  To stop it, you need to push a little button underneath the steering column.  After putting up with this for several years, my mother has decided that on her next car, she will spend the extra cash to get the remote.

Aside from the few minor setbacks, my mom has never regretted buying her Camry.  She loves driving it, feels safe in it, and hopes to keep it (conditions permitting) until it is 10 years old.  The car isn't a head-turner, it is more for those looking for a refined vehicle that will blend in and look good doing it.  I would recommend it to just about anyone, whether you want a safe family car, or a dependable car for commuting to work or school.  However, if you're looking for extreme styling, you won't find it here.<br><br>
