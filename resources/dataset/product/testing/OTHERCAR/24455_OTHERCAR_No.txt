            I did a lot of research before buying the No. 1 rated digital camera from E-opinions.com. This is my first digital camera and initially I was very pleased with my purchase. As expected, the picture quality was immaculate, with great color and clarity. Another plus is Sony's Lithium battery power system, which has to be the most superior on the market. This was a big deciding factor for me. Most other manufacturers still use those wretched AA batteries.

Too bad Sony had to be so cheap supplying only a 4MB memory stick. Using high end imaging it takes no more than 3 pictures. This is where Sony have you caught because you can only buy the memory stick from them. However, the memory stick itself is amazingly small and compact, and with a non-erase safety switch, it can be used to store all of your pictures for a very long time.

The real downer for me though was the lack of an optical viewfinder. It's not so bad indoors but outside in the bright sun it's practically impossible to get a clear view of the LCD screen, even when using the brightness control. I guess Sony realized this was a problem because later models (DSC-S70 and S75) now have the viewfinder. I'm still very happy with the Sony product but the missing viewfinder was something I just couldn't tolerate so the camera is now back in its original carton and on the way to the store for an upgrade to the Sony DSC-S75.
