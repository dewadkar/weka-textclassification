            This car is definitely one you fall in love with immediately. I have had mine almost three years, and the car has convinced friends of mine that they really need their own convertible.
But the best part of my car isn't the wonderful feeling of the wind through my hair, the fun of looking up at the stars or feeling the warmth of the sun.  It's that the car can be hit by a Tahoe and survive.
I was pulling out of a gas station on the way to Myrtle Beach (on I-95 in North Carolina). I looked right and left and didn't see anything, but the intersection was a bad one. Unfortunately, as I turned left, and Tahoe came barrelling over the hill and hit the front of my car (around my front left tire). The car turned around 180 degrees, and the hood ripped off. But neither I nor my passenger were injured at all. No whiplash, no bruises from being turned around.  We were a little sore the next day, but that's all. The hood tore off, but it folded over to the side so it wouldn't hurt anyone in the car. The engine was busted and most of the front of my car had to be replaced, but now you can't even tell any work was done.
Any time you can be hit by a Tahoe, going about 40 mph, and walk away without a scratch, you have to thank your car.
My complaints are that the roof tends to become &quot;untucked&quot; -- it sticks out over my windows. And, I have had problems with needing a special filter so the oil doesn't leak back where it's not supposed to be.
But other than that, the car has been great.<br><br>
