            Just recently, a friend of mine - who knew of my interest in another digital camera - called me to inform that he and his wife had two for sale.  His wife's was a 3-m.pixel Kodak model, and his was the 3.3 Olympus C3000 unit.  The former was selling for $140, and the latter for $150. I really knew nothing much, about either of these cameras, but was swayed to the Olympus C3000 on the strength of my very satisfied experience with the digital camera that we already owned - an Olympus D-340R. This camera had served us quite well, but it was only a 1.3 megapixel model, and I had been itching for something with more power of resolution.  

I walked away with the camera with nothing more than just the unit itself (no manual, no lens cap, no software, no remote, no batteries, adapter or USB cable)- and the assurance that all was functioning properly with it.  The first thing that I did, after buying and installing batteries, was to take a picture of one of my daughters.  I then placed the 64Meg SmartMedia card into my floppy disk adapter, and drew the photo into my CPU.  Without any toying around with the photo I immediately proceeded to print the photo out, and I was floored by the output.  My printer is an HP DeskJet 940c, and I was only using regular printer paper.  That photo was printed to the full sheet, and what was rendered was nothing short of amazing.  The colors & clarity were astounding, and I can only imagine what it would have looked like on premium photo paper. Being much more than satisfied with this, my next step was to download the manual.  It was then that I REALLY found out about the host of features & capabilities that are incorporated into this fine piece of equipment.  

If I just HAD to chose one thing about this camera that I felt was somewhat of a drawback, it would be the time that it takes to get a shot off.  'Set' shots are no problem, but action shots are somewhat of another story.  There seems to be such a lag between the time of button depression, and the time the shot is actually registered (or read - I guess the term is), that the object of aim has left the path of focus before being captured.  

This camera serves MY needs exceedingly well, and I (knowing what I know now about this gem) would not have had a problem paying three times as much as I did for it. IT IS TRULY A GREAT BUY.
