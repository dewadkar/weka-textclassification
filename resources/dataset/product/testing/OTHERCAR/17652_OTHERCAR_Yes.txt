            I own a 1987 Volvo 760 Turbo and brought it to Bahrain with me.  After the extensive heat some parts gave out.  So I decided to look for a newer Volvo.  On the way to pick up a used car report on a 1995 850 my wife received a call to look at a 1996 850 T-5  I reluctantly did and fell in love.  We test drove it, had it checked out and made an offer.  
The salesman (it was a Toyota exec&#146s car&#133Hmmmm a Toyota rep driving a Volvo?  Good choice!) started high and we got him down to 3K Dinar (about 8500).  We have driven it around and wished we were in a European country so we could take it on trips (Bahrain is only 15 miles wide by about 35 miles long and we can&#146t drive off it.)

I am waiting for the CD holder for the changer to hear the quality 8-speaker system.  This car is a European made car with different specs here for the heat.  

We love the Turbo, you need it to compete with the Arab drivers here.  We also love the safety features: driver&#146s air bag, dual SIPS (no passenger air bag, I guess Arabs don&#146t think much about the passenger) and it feels like a tank.  I also like that Volvo started using glass sun roofs instead of the old metal ones.  I like to let the sun in.

Overall, a great car we expect to have for many years!
