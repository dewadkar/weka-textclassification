            I have a 2002 Toyota Corolla S and have put 1,500 miles on it so far.  I love this car!  Don't let the auto writers tell you the car is stodgy looking; in Impulse Red Pearl (see sample picture on this site) with fancy wheel covers the car is very attractive.  It's fun to drive, and the black interior with red stitching on the steering wheel and shifter is nice-looking. 

The ergonomics are great.  Everything is where it's supposed to be.   The cup holders could be better placed, though.  Any drink item will block your access to the radio controls.   Seat comfort can be a subjective thing, but I could use front seats that are a tad more supportive/firm. 
I've taken two long trips (500 miles round trip) and had a bit of a backache for one leg of those trips.  As for quietness, it's reasonably quiet inside.  It doesn't ride like a Cadillac but it does a good job nonetheless.

Another problem is finding a 5-speed model, esp. in the southeastern U.S.  I lucked out when the dealer located one en route from the factory to the distribution point.  

Overall, I'm very happy.  A Corolla is a good investment as far as cars go.  It will be reliable, has good resale value and is a joy to drive.
