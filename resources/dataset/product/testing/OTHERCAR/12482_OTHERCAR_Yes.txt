            When I was in the market for a new car, I wanted something with good looks and performance. But my morning freeway commute also made reliability and looks very important. I had settled on a Volvo, and admitted that I would have to give up good looks and performance.  Halfway through signing the papers for my boxy, ugly (but safe, reliable) Volvo s70, the manager was watching the delivery of an s40 to the showroom.  Interrupting the salesman, I walked over and examined the s40. Can this sleek, sporty looking car be a Volvo, I thought to myself.

One test drive later I was signing papers for the s40. Test driving it was a dream. Great handling, and 0-60 in under 8 seconds. The turbo was great for passing,and a tight turning radius made maneuvering easy, even fun. The seats are comforable, very comfortable and the factory stereo was surprisingly good. The most interesting thing about the s40, looking at one, is that it  has the look of both a sports car and a luxury sedan. The only complaint (a minor one really) was the tight footspace for backseat passengers. 

Highly recomended for someone looking for Volvo reputation, without traditional Volvo looks.
