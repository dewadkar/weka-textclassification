            I like the 2000 Dodge Neon. I find it very nice inside and comfortable to drive. It handles very well, and the factory air it very cold. I did find that it kind of lacks acceleration from a stand still, yet it can quickly reach high end mph well. I noticed engine noise at around 60-75 mph, but quiets down above or below that. The breaks on this car is great, and I found it hard at first to get used to them. I like the power steering also. It turns very well with no effort needed. Trunk space is good, yet the door tends to fall on you when it is up and car is on a slight incline. I have already had the gas tank filler port break off inside the body to where I have to reach inside the body to grab it to fill up on gas. It does idle kind of rough for a car with low miles(22,000)but overall I think I made a great choice so far.I found out that if you the trunk lid springs forward one hole on the bracket, it will keep the trunk from falling.
