            My parents recently purchased the 2001 Saturn SL2. At first glance, it's a gorgeous car. It's very smooth looking on the exterior. When you look at the interior it also looks spectacular, I especially enjoyed the c.d. player, which has a great sound quality. There are controls for all the windows in the front seat, which is great for parents with smaller children. However, when driving it's somewhat uncomfortable. In order to feel more comfortable, I have to push the seat back as far as it will go, leaving no room for any passengers riding in the back seats. But, since I'm a new driver, this car is great when it comes to parking and fitting into tight spaces. It's very easy to control. One other problem, very loud and squeaky windshield wipers!
