            This car is truly a masterpiece of design and technology, blended with a touch of practicality and drivability rarely seen in a car of this calibre. While the car is a blend of race-inspired technology, the NSX can be used for running about town with the manners of a Civic, show up at the opera with the etiquette of a 3.5RL or driven with the spirit of the race track inspired Type R. Probably its' most unlikeable quality is all the gawkers and questions you have to answer about it in the shopping centre parking lot!

Unfortunately, the NSX never caught on with the right crowds and has been underrated and undersold in a world dominated by Porsches and Corvettes. For the true drivers in the world, the boy racers that can hardly wait to hear the wail of titanium rod spinning at 7 grand, this mid-engined, alloy bodied beauty is, dollar for dollar, the bargain of the nineties.  <br><br>
