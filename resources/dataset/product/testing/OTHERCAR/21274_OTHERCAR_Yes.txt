            This was a great car, til I totaled it.  

It has a spacious interior, excellent sound system, automatic transmission, passenger-side airbags, trunk space, and a really nice look... it says &quot;I'm successful...&quot; but doesn't have the &quot;I'm successful and better than you&quot; look of the Lexus. In a way, the Camry is like the Lexus's overshadowed little sister. 

Anyway, the car can be a little pricy, but hey, splurge. It's better than plunging into a wall in a Geo. 

That's right. From now on, I'm driving in a tank.   

Okay, so, anyway, my right tire blows sending me hurling on the 91 freeway into the center divider(you know how dangerous blown tires are? if I had been near a drop off, I probably wouldn't be here now. Someone needs to look into this.... ) where I bounce off, spin around, and stop traffic like a naked woman (but an attractive one. not like, a deuce bigalow trainee). Good ol' Los Angeles drivers...some even offered to let me use their cellphones...I guess they were hoping to stick around till the news crews came. It is Hollywood, you know.   Oh, and I advise you to drive with a child carseat in the back, even if you don't have kids.... people are more likely to stop and help if they think there's a kid bleeding to death in the car...use this opportunity to ask for money. Anyway, the car was totaled, but I emerged (after kicking the door open) without a scratch (okay, I had a bump on my head)... 

Thank god the front of the car is so long, because the airbags didn't deploy.   Thank God I was wearing a seat belt, because the windows cracked. Thank God no one was in the backseat, or they'd have hair glittering in the sun with the specks of broken glass in their tresses.  

Yeah. I'm glad God gave me a second chance.  I'm gonna go write my submission for Chicken Soup for the Soul now.
