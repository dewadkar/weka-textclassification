            The sleek lines, the sexy note of the exhaust, the speedometer that goes to 150mph.  That's what I first noticed about the Avenger.  When I put the pedal down during the test drive I was impressed with it's precise handling, and when the old lady pulled out in front of me I was blown away by the anti-lock brakes.  You actually CAN steer away from a collision with them.  I had to buy it.

70,000 miles later here is my report.  New tires, 30,000 miles.  New battery 35,000.  Transmission lock up, 45,000.  Another new battery, 48,000.  New Computer, 50,000(solved the battery problem).  Transmission and oil leak, 68,000.

Thank God for extended warranties, which paid for everything but the tires.  I'm a little disappointed with it's acceleration, but I would not consider it slow by any means.  Decent handling in snow and ice, but you should consider good snow tires if you live in the north.  Gas mileage has stayed around 20 city and 30 highway, and insurance rates have been very reasonable.

My Avenger (now my wife's) is a 96 ES, totally loaded.  I highly recommend an extended warranty with no deductible and a bug screen if your area has love bugs.  I bought one of those breathable car covers from Mopar for it, but stopped using it after a month because I'm pretty lazy.  If you get leather, Zymoil Leather Treatment works very well keeping everything soft and new looking.  Another must have is the premium sound system.

If you're looking for a good looking, great handling, almost fast car, the Dodge Avenger is worth a serious look.<br><br>
