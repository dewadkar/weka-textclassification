            I purchased my 1990 VW Cabriolet in 1996.  I was a little leary about buying a car that was so &quot;old&quot;, especially considering the car I got rid of was newer. But, I had always wanted this car, and I was going to have it. I ended up getting a little red one with a white top and white CLOTH seats (BIG MISTAKE)! I absolutely fell in love with this car.  The attention that befalls you while touring around town is amazing. This car, despite it's small stature, is like a TANK! Of course, it runs like a semi, is slow as a dog (91 HP), and engine is LOUD! But that's what makes this car so endearing. It's hard to explain to someone who has never owned an older VW, but it gets under your skin, evokes a passion within! It's tiny inside, not for those taller folks, unless you plan on keeping the top down. The layout inside is basic and the radio and speaker quality are sub-par. However, throw in a Blaupunkt CD player, some 6x9's in the front doors (ya, you heard me...6x9's...I don't need no stinkin' leg room!) and a box in the truck and you've got yourself a small system that can be heard while driving 80 on the freeway, with the top down. And the way it handles, it's a blast to drive. I never had many repair problems and most of the money I put into it was fine tuning the car and making it better. I owned that car for 2 years (getting weepy) and finally had to trade it in for a &quot;mommy&quot; car. Now, after writing this, and being without it for almost a year and a half, I miss it so much. How often does a car do that to you? :*(<br><br>
