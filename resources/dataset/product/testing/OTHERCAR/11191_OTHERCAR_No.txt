                 Below is our response to our many problems in getting adequate service and especially parts from Mazda and the repairs of such a poorly built vehicle. It is very obvious to us the standards at Mazda have changed significantly since we are on our second MPV. Trying the normal channels of going through the dealer,zone manager ect. of getting any relief (money for repairs)is a lost art through Mazda.
We understand general replacement of lighter items such as batteries,brakes, starters ect. but our problems with this particular vehicle our outrageous. The power of eopinions in this case hopefully will help all of you in making your choice.  

     Reviewers read below our letter to the CEO of MazdaUSA and make your own decision. Keep in mind that old saying, "If I had only listened back then I would not be here now!"

Re: 1995 Mazda MPV 
December 4, 2001

Dear CEO Hughes,

     In 1996 my wife and I purchased a 1995 MPV Mazda.  This was the second Mazda MPV we had purchased since 1989.  It is with great frustration that we feel compelled to write you this letter about the problems we have had to deal with over the past few years regarding our 1995 Mazda MPV.

     This first problem occurred when the hydraulic lifters started �chattering�. We were advised by Mazda service, �Sunflower Mazda� located in Olathe, Kansas that all the lifters needed replaced because the original lifters manufactured had oil journals that were too small.  We had the work done about three years ago and now the noise has returned. 
Repair cost about $800.00

     The second problem occurred when a bolt inside the timing belt cover backed out of the engine block shredding the timing belt. As a result we had the vehicle towed to �Sunflower Mazda�.  We were advised the two timing belt tension pulleys had bad bearings and needed replaced.  We paid for the work.  The water pump failed a week later.
Repair cost about $800.00 without water pump.

     The third problem occurred this fall when the bearing failed inside the air conditioner clutch housing.  As of this date we have not repaired this item. 
Estimated repair cost $1300.00

     The forth problem is that the bearing on the left rear spindle of this vehicle failed. As I write this letter a mechanic at �Laird Noller� in Kansas City Kansas is trying to pound out the failed bearing.  We now have to replace the spindle because the bearing cannot be removed at this point.  Repair cost?  Before axle replacement $143.00 plus parts�Now $700-$800 with rear axle and new backing plate. 

******************************************************
Reviewers note: Backing plate cannot be found in inventory of parts warehouse so our vehicle was out of service for an additional week, by the way that backing plate also cost $140.00 additional. 
*******************************************************

     We tried to get this repaired at �Sunflower Mazda� back in August.  The service adviser told us he was waiting on �special order tools� to repair it. I had placed several calls over the past few months to see if the �special tools� had arrived yet but we finally gave up on �Sunflower Mazda� and contacted �Laird Noller Mazda.� We had been very satisfied with the service at �Sunflower�.
****************************************************
Reviewers note: The service adviser at "Laird Noller" told us no "special tools" where needed to extract the bearings out of the housing. The mechanic that worked on this vehicle advised us the bearings where unusually wide in design and where just a little harder to remove. So much for dealer knowledge of the product?
********************************************************

     Mr. Hughes, this vehicle has 81,000 miles on it and is 6 years old. My wife and I understand that nothing last forever including vehicle warranties. We have maintained this vehicle as specified in the owners� manual to the letter.  

     Unfortunately in this case it seems every bearing is failing on this vehicle. I tried having the service representative at �Sunflower� contact the local Zone Manager for some type of relief in these situations but all I got was��The vehicle is out of warranty�. 

     We were very happy with the first Mazda MPV we purchased back in 1990. (Alternator failing at 72,000 but understand nothing in the power train failed). 

   Mr. Hughes we have had a nightmare with our second MPV. The bearings and lifters on your vehicles produce by Mazda should be designed to last a great deal longer than they have on this one. (spindle bearings started failing at 70,000).
****************************************************
Reviewers note: We were told by "Sunflower" no dealer in the metro area had tools to fix it. We trusted the dealer so we did not try to call other dealers. After driving this vehicle several months with noise increasing from the rear end we elected to call "Laird Noller". Guess who does our service now?
********************************************************
     Our radiator failed in November of 2001, we would consider this a normal wear and tear item, however the radiator was not leaking at a joint or core, the leak occurred where the manufacturer�s numbers were stamped. 

     The service and availability of parts and tools to repair the Mazda vehicles your company produces should be obtainable within a reasonable period of time. In this case they have not. Our need to have a quality and dependable vehicle has not been met by the Mazda Motor Corporation.

      It is very obvious to us the standards have changed in the quality control standards at Mazda Motor Corporation.  As the CEO of Mazda we thought you would like to know we will no longer be recommending or purchasing any type of vehicle that is produced by the Mazda Motor Corporation. 

We thank you for taking the time to read this letter.

*******************************************************
Reviewers please note:

Considering the safety factor with the failure of the rear spindle bearings on this vehicle we will be filing a complaint with the federal highway safety commission or whoever conducts vehicle recalls. 

I am also seriously considering changing this vehicle into a BBQ smoker like the guy did with the "Pontiac Fiero" a few years back. If you do not think I am serious keep watching the news. If you have any experience in designing smokers out of a minivan let me know?
