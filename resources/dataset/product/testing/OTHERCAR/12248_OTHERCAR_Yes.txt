            Mitsubishi Galant ES-V6 (1999)

Mitsubishi created an all-new car for 1999.  The old model always lacked the V-6 engine American consumers desired (available in both Honda Accord and Toyota Camry).  The new, sharper-looking Galant offers smooth and refined 4-cylinder and V-6 engines.  The new 4-cylinder has dual counter-balancer shafts making it very smooth.  &quot;NVH&quot; (Noise, Vibration, and Harshness) levels compare favorably to rival 4-cylinder engines.  The four has plenty of oomph around town and lacks somewhat only in passing power at highway speeds.  The new 3.0 liter V-6 engine is powerful and lends a sporty edge to this 4-door family sedan. The only available transmission in the USA is an electronically-controlled 4-speed automatic.  The sharp new styling makes it virtual clone of the BMW 3-series, which is a good thing indeed.

What makes this car in mid-level &quot;ES&quot; and &quot;ES-V6&quot; versions is features-per-dollar.  1999 prices were $17,000 for the base DS, $18,000 for the ES and $20,000 for the ES-V6.  No other car available has this level of style, comfort, power, and amenities at these price levels.  2000 model-year prices are only slightly higher.  The fully-loaded LS takes a big jump in price up to $24,250 while the boy-racer GTZ model was $24,350.  At these higher price points, the LS and GTZ compare more closely with rivals Accord and Camry, each of which is destined to hold higher resale value than the Galant.

Note that Mitsubishi touts the ES-V6 Galant's selection by Car and Driver magazine as &quot;Best Family Sedan Under $20K&quot;.  However, and this is an important point, Accord and Camry barely miss this price cap when equipped with a V-6 engine.  While a 4-cylinder Accord or Camry is judged inferior overall to a V-6 Galant, the V-6 versions of those rivals cost only $1,500 more for the Honda and $2,500 more for the Toyota.  Had the test been for &quot;Best Family Sedan Under $22.5K&quot;, the result almost certainly would have been different.  Now, an extra $2,500 in retail price works out to an additional $50 per month for a 5-year car loan.  How you evaluate the trade-off is up to you.  Personally, I am content to pocket the extra $50 a month and drive what I consider to be the better-looking, sportier car.

PROS:
Sharp-looking, good-handling and relatively quiet with a powerful engine and a &quot;smart&quot; computer-controlled transmission.

CONS:
The biggest concern is the air-conditioning, which is only barely adequate.  People living in Florida and the desert SouthWest beware!  I had the opportunity to speak with a group of Mitsubishi engineers from Illinois, California and Japan about this issue.  It seems that the one and only A/C system was designed to avoid dragging down the less powerful 4-cylinder engine.  To save costs, the same small-capacity A/C system was grafted onto the larger V-6 engine.  The engineers I spoke with seemed concerned about this decision in light of the complaints they were hearing about the new car.

Also, Mitsubishi seems to have a problem with warping brake rotors on many of it's cars and the Galant is no exception.  Fortunately, repairs are handled under warranty with no questions - my guess is that they are very used to hearing this complaint by now ('95-'99 Eclipses had this repair frequently).

Lastly, early-model 1999 Galants all shipped with defective, low-strength plastic interior door handles.  Mitsubishi is aware of the problem and has been replacing broken door handles under warranty with a unit made from a tougher plastic.
 
BOTTOM LINE:  Superior to any other car available AT THIS PRICE POINT in this class.  The ES and ES-V6 are the biggest bang-for-the-buck around. If price is less of consideration, test drive Accord and Camry and then buy whichever one suits you the best.  Resale values probably make the Honda or Toyota even more attractive under a lease agreement.

TIP:
Buy near the end of the month when dealers and salesmen are anxious to meet quotas.  Price negotiations are much improved compared to the beginning of the month.  Also, consider an on-line car-buying service with professional negotiators that can find the rock-bottom lowest price in your area for the car you want.<br><br>
