            I bought a 2002 Chevrolet Avalanche. For the reason of having twin boys on the way. The room on the inside is great
and has seated three grown adults, comfortably in the back seat. My problem with this truck is that on the commercial it appears to be very easy to change from the pickup to an SUV. It is not as easy as the commercial says it is.
The back seat is split. Where the driver side rear has the two seats together, while the passenger side has the single seat. Therefore it either takes two people to change out the truck to bed combo, or several trips around your vehicle. I will say that I am a farmer, so I use the truck part quite often. It gets annoying having to change that part out. Another negative to this is also the bed cover.
It is in three different sections. Which means climbing up in the bed to take each piece out. Then comes storage. Where to put those three pieces. If you are using the bed, they will not fit it there, especially if you have something big enough you have to lay down the back seats.
So there is another trip, into the house, then back out to the house. Remember though it does look nice and I personally love the inside room for passengers. For use as a truck it is a lot of work. So before purchasing one, remember what you use of your vehicle is going to be.
