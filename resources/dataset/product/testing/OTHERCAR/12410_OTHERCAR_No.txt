            We bought the 2002 VW Passat wagon in the fall of 2001.  At the time, there weren't many wagons on the market, and we didn't want an SUV, so we bought this car.  Out of the box, it's very nice (see pros above).  However, we've had to take this car in at least 5 times in the last two years (2 recalls and 3 other problems), which is unacceptable in my book.  Also, we have a poor dealership service department (Maund VW in Austin) and that has made getting it fixed even more of a hassle, even if under warranty.  They are understaffed and slow to repair, they never call to update on status, they frequently do not have loaners available, and last time we took the car in they removed a hub cap and then denied it later, claiming it came in that way (which we had no way to prove otherwise).

Problems we have had:

1.  Recall for potential fire hazard due to lack of protection of the fuel lines
2.  Recall for defective ignition coils.  Our car has 4 but they would only replace the one when it failed.  So now we are potentially facing 3 more trips to the repair shop each time the others fail.  
3.  Leak in the steering fluid line - caused a horrible grinding sound when turning.
4.  A heat shield bracket broke off under the car and was hanging down and almost scraping the ground.
5.  A/C stopped working and would blow hot air for 10-15 minutes at a time.  For this problem, we had to take it to be fixed multiple times because the dealership claimed they could not reproduce the problem.  The dealership also told me that the A/C might blow hot air from time to time - this was a "feature" designed not to overtax the engine.  I cannot believe this is true - if the engine cannot support the A/C and the rest of the car at highway speeds, this is a serious design problem.

I really do like the car in general, and I believe that much of my frustration with it stems from the poor dealership service I am getting.  However, Maund is the only VW dealer in Austin and so they have a captive market.  If any VW execs are reading this, please reconsider your dealer relationship with Maund at your next earliest opportunity.   Since I've started having problems with that dealership, I'm surprised at the number of other people I've talked to who also have had problems with them.

Now that other manufacturers are building wagons again, I will never go back to VW.  I'm sad about it, and maybe we just got a lemon.  But a car is too big of an investment to gamble.  Honda, please please please make the Accord wagon again!
