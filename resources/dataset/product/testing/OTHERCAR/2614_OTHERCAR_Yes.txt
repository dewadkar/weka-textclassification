            I bought my 99 sherwood green maxima se in August 99, and love it so far.  Back then it was an easy choice between the 99 model and the 2000 model: there was a $5000 discount from the factory that made my 99 about $6000 less than a similarly equiped 2000 model!! Wow I said.
Anyway, this car really is quick and responsive (I got the 5-speed), I have a feeling the auto isn't quite as quick.  Obviously it's not as fast as a Mustang GT, but it'll keep up with or beat a Mustang V6 or a regular Camaro!  The interior is roomy, I love the leather seats (not too supportive in tight corners, though), and the automatic climate control works great.  BTW, the shifter knob SUCKS!  You'll want to go buy a Momo knob.  Ask your dealer about a strut tower bar, it makes the steering much more predictable in long, sweeping turns, and only costs about $75.
This is a family car that has the makings for a wicked street racer... it would just cost a few extra grand.  For a nominal amount anyone can make it sportier: strut tower bar, rear anti-sway bar, Eibach sport springs, K&amp;N Filtercharger intake, but don't go too far with it... it's a family car, remember?<br><br>
