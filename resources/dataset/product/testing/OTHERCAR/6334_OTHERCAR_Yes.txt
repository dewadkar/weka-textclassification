            Well 1998 was the first year of the Sienna and we (my wife and I) decided to buy it.  Seemed like a nice car, needed the space for my kids, sports.....anyways.....the first year model was fine but the only problem we've had with it is  the brakes.  The brakes wear incredibly easy and we had to replace the brake pads more often than we should have.  We finally took it to a good brake place and they said that the hydraulics on the brakes were broken, they were fixed, and the brakes returned back to "normal."  The brakes even after they were fixed were pretty good but the van doesn't stop as easily as some other cars.  Occasionally when you hit the brakes hard, it makes this grinding sound.  After the hydraulics were replaced, I believe that solved the problem.  The buttons on the radio became loose after too much use.  The doors get stuck sometimes.  The bucket seats are hard to put back in once taken out.  Those are about the only problems with the van.  It's a great car with great reliability.  It hasn't broken down, haven't had any problems at all but I believe that defines most of Toyota built cars.  I am glad that I got this car and I think that it will last and I will keep it a long time.  I didn't use the word "luxury" anywhere in here because I don't think that minivans can be luxurious.  It's the extra added things on cars to make them luxurious and about the only thing a Sienna would qualify for in that category is the power door.  Otherwise, everything's normal and the way it should be.  I don't need an extremely luxurious car to carry around my children.  I recommend it completely and enjoy........
