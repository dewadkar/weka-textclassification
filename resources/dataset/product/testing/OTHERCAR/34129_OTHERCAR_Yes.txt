            I bought my gold 240SX new in 1995, for what I still consider to be a great price.  Since then, every time I get into the car, I still get a little thrill.  I love the low seating with my butt close to the ground, the looks from other drivers  the car still gets even after over six years, and the knowledge that it will start right up, every time I turn the key (even at 102,000 miles).

As the car gets older, I know I'll have to begin putting some money into it.  The struts need to be replaced, because on cold days the front end hits the ground at bumps.  The timing chains (yep, there are two) will probably need to be replaced, and I'm not sure about the clutch.  After doing some research on these parts, unless you've got some illicit source for parts, it's going to cost some money.  But I can't complain - I've had plenty of trouble-free years.

I do not have any issues with rust, but 240SX brakes are notorious.  The original front rotors tend to warp, and I had to replace them.  But when they work, they work great.  The car handles very well, even with 15-inch tires (I have the base model, not the SE, which came with 16-inch wheels).  The engine runs smoothly, albeit a bit noisily, acceleration is still good, and gas mileage averages around 24 to 25 miles per gallon (city).  Also, with rear-wheel drive, you have the standard handling issues in wet and icy conditions.  But here in Atlanta, that's not a really big concern for me.

We are thinking of a family soon, so I expect to have the car only another two to three years.  By that time, I will probably have over 140,000 miles on the car, and the history of the car says they will be reliable (and fun!) miles.  So anyone who is looking at buying this car used (since they stopped making them after the 98 model year), you have my whole-hearted recommendation and support.
