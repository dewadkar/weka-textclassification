            We have a 1995 Dodge Caravan which has the old, boxy body style. We bought it in August of 1995 and got a great deal because the new body style 1996s were on the lot already and nobody wanted the old style.. except those wanting to save money, like me!!!

I went from a 4-door sedan to the minivan and absolutely love it!! There is a lot of room for up to 7 people and it is very easy to load 'em up and move 'em out! I never realized how cramped we were in the car until I got the minivan.

We have been driving the Caravan as our primary form of transportation for nearly 5 years and have had no problems mechanically. The only maintenance we've had done are routine - oil changes, tires and brakes. We have been cross-country with it and I never worried about whether or not we were going to break down at the side of the road. With three kids and a husband who travels quite a bit, I need reliable transportation and, with the Dodge Caravan, I have it.

I get about 20 mpg, but this is not too bad considering that I have a V-6 and the size of the vehicle. I only have the sliding door on one side and admit I would prefer the new body style with the sliding doors on both sides, but I would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for roomy, reliable transportation.<br><br>
