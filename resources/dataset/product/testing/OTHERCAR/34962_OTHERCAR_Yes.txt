                 First off, I would like to state for the record that this is the first Pontiac I've ever bought. So whatever bias might be expected from a loyal Pontiac follower will not be found here.
     In a nutshell, this car is plain great! I fell in love with the style of this car while surfing the internet (and stumbling across the Pontiac homepage - www.pontiac.com). And when the time came to purchase a new vehicle, there was no dispute in my mind that I was going to get a 4-door Pontiac Grand Prix GTP. And that's exactly what I got - silver, fully loaded to the brim, including a Bose Sound System and some other nice little gadgets, and with a set of chrome wheels. I love this car.
     The engine - a supercharged Series II 3800 from GM. This engine's been around for a while now, which makes it all that much better because of the amount of work General Motors has done on this engine. They really get the most out of this 3.8litre V-6 - a base of 200 hp, and the supercharger boosts it up to 240 hp, along with a healthy 280lb.ft of torque. The 3800 is hot of the block to begin with, and the supercharger keeps up the power all the way into the seriously high revs. 
     The chassis is really matched quite well to the engine - together, along with the seamless 4-speed automatic transmission, they pack quite a punch. The car holds up really well in turns, has a very solid feel to it driving at most any speed, and due to the traction control and ABS systems holds its own in the snow as well. 
     Pretty much, anyone who can shell a good $28,000 into this nice, nice car will be rewarded quite well. Anyone from high schoolers (like my son) to old war veterans (like my father) can drive this car and have a good time. Really, really recommended to anyone who likes a bit of speed in their life.<br><br>
