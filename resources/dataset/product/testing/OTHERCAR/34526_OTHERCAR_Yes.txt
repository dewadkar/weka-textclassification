            I bought this camera about ten months ago and have used it for everything from taking pictures for my internet auction business to taking pictures of friends and sites while traveling. While I was in California, I even used my friend's CompactFlash card in my camera so I could have more storage. I have also noticed that my pictures are usually of as good a quality and color/contrast/hue as his - even though he paid much more for his camera. I also recently did a promotional photoshoot with both my camera and my friend's Pentax 1000 (a manual 35mmm camera). The pictures taken with my camera were better! And we could tell as we took the pictures, which ones we wanted to keep - and make minor adjustments as we went along. We waited weeks and paid alot of money to get the regular pictures developed and then did not we have anything new or better than the ones we had taken and already used from my camera. 

At home, I leave my cable connected to the computer and downloading pictures is as easy as hooking up my camera and opening and closing the shutter, then selecting where I want the pictures to be saved. It does take a while on the best quality of pictures, but I can receive an item and have it up for auction for minutes. Ditto for sending friends all the newest pictures of me and the events that I have attended. 

When I bought this I was just starting my company and was on a tight budget. I was considering a cheaper camera from Vivitar, but after looking at several magazine comparisons of the pictures, I decided that the additional money that I paid for this camera was well worth it. It is by far the best deal in it's class. It is a great combination of good quality and a wide range of features at a low price. I actually purchased mine refurbished from Egghead/Surplus Direct Auctions for a slightly lower price but have not had any problems with it whatsoever. The only caveat is that it is not made for very close photography of small items (such as jewelry), but I usually use my scanner for that.
