            Let me blunt about this product upfront: it was a grave disappointment.  I know I&#146m in the minority here, and given the excellent reviews of this product elsewhere it is possible that the particular unit I bought had some problem that affected its optical quality.  Attempts to get Olympus to address this met with stonewalling - which is enough reason to not recommend this camera to a buyer (and as an Olympus user for more than 20 years, this poor customer service was a great disappointment to me).  Anyway, with that caveat, here&#146s the review.  Read the other reviews here and draw your own conclusions.

Had the Olympus Camedia 3020 Zoom been my first venture into digital photography, I would probably never have realized the problems associated with it.  However, luckily (or not) for me, last year I bought a much cheaper Hewlett-Packard, the HP Photosmart 315 ($250 after rebate).  Before I launch into my critique of the Olympus, a description of its cheaper and (in many ways) much better competitor is in order.  I know the comparison is apples and oranges because one camera is a point-and-shoot and the other a more serious piece of equipment; but the comparison does put things into perspective nonetheless.

The HP 315 is a mid-range, no frills point-and-shoot, with a 2.1 Megapixel resolution.  It&#146s basic in that it is entirely automatic, doesn&#146t allow you to mess with aperture or shutter speed, and certainly doesn&#146t have any of the advanced settings offered by the Olympus 3020 Zoom (such as black and white, white balance control etc).  In other words, it&#146s not for anyone wanting creativity and control.  However, it&#146s a dream to use all the way through the process (from actually taking photos to downloading and viewing the images).  What&#146s more, it takes wonderful pictures at three resolution settings.  The lowest resolution is adequate for most snapshot needs; the second level is excellent (giving clear, full-screen images on a PC), and I rarely use the third - though it&#146s clear that the any pictures taken on this highest setting could be blown up to large size without loss of resolution.

More praise for the HP: it&#146s CONVENIENT in every respect.  Resolution changing is one-touch, and the menu system is simple and logical.  Furthermore, downloading couldn&#146t be easier: you connect to your PC with the USB cable provided, open the camera and the software automatically recognizes the camera and prompts you for download.  Before you do this, you can view the images and rotate them if necessary, then select a folder to download them into (the software remembers where you sent the last batch and offers you that as a default), and off you go.  It also gives you the option to delete the photos from the camera after they&#146ve been downloaded.  Finally, the photo viewing software that comes with the HP 315 is ACDSee, which is outstanding and very easy to use.  All this for $250, a year ago; much cheaper now.

But the Olympus Camedia C-3020 Zoom is almost twice as expensive (I paid $445, plus another $25 for a 32 Meg storage card), is 3.2 MP and in many other ways is much fancier, so it must be much better, right?  Wrong.  Yes, it has many more features than the HP, but then it&#146s supposed to be more like an SLR than the humble little HP point-and-shoot.  Most of the problems I list below are, admittedly, simply convenience-related, although this drawback in itself is enough to suggest that you seek another piece of equipment.

However, I was astonished to find in a side-by-side test with the HP 315 that the C-3020 actually takes WORSE photos, and does so with larger file sizes.  I snapped a series of photos with each camera, at the same time, from exactly the same locations and in exactly the same conditions; with flash and without.  These included inside and outside photos, as well as an experiment in which I took pictures of books in a bookcase (the print is a good test of a lens&#146 optical quality). 

I tested the lowest resolution on each camera, and also compared the HP&#146s second resolution level with the Olympus&#146 second (HQ, high quality) setting.  The resolution on the Olympus was in all cases inferior, and it dealt consistently poorly with many exposures in its fully automatic mode (both inside and outside photos frequently came out darker or less even than on the HP).  Yes, you can of course compensate for this on the Olympus by utilizing the camera&#146s option for manual control, but this is cumbersome to do every time and would certainly be a trial and error process.  When you&#146re trying to get easy photos without much fiddling around in a standard, non-creative situation, you&#146d like the automatic mode to be able to do this with no fuss.  It doesn&#146t.

Then I compared the HP - still at its second-level resolution - with the 3020's THIRD level (SHQ); note that the latter generates file sizes that are between one and two million bytes.  Amazingly, the point-and-shoot STILL performed better, with markedly superior resolution (and at file sizes less than a quarter of those generated by the Olympus).

Given the poor image quality, it may be pointless to list other problems with this camera, but here they are anyway.  The optical zoom (3x) on the Olympus is of course much superior to the max 2.5 digital zoom on the HP; the latter provides lousy resolution at its maximum setting and is essentially unusable as a result.  But the Olympus zoom has the annoying feature that - on any setting except the most wide-angle (the camera default) - the viewfinder image is shifted from the image that the camera actually captures.  This means that, in any mode except wide angle, you have to compose a photo using the LCD screen, which is a very fast way to drain batteries.

The menus on the Olympus are complicated, though you get used to them with practice.  However, there is no one-touch feature for resolution control, so if you want to switch from snapshot to HQ (or better) mode this involves a several-step process (again, with the HP 315 you can do this with a single button).  The highest quality setting on the Olympus gives you a TIFF file, which is all very well, but it&#146s so enormous (millions of bytes) that storage and manipulation become a major issue.  And again, the second and third resolution levels (HQ and SHQ) are inferior to the HQ setting of the HP 315, yet the file sizes it produces are larger.

The manual for the Olympus is not great in terms of its ease of use.  To begin with, the camera comes with a series of brief printed manuals, and if you want the detailed instructions for anything you have to read a pdf file.  Personally, I find this really annoying; I&#146d much rather have a complete and compact manual in hand (yes, you can print the pdf file, but it&#146s not the same).  For some reason, the idiots who write these things have an aversion to the use of an index, which means that you can&#146t easily find specific topics and must instead wade through the paperwork.

The software (Camedia) that comes with the 3020 is miserable in comparison to HP&#146s.  Unlike the HP, the Olympus software doesn&#146t automatically recognize the camera and prompt for downloading; in fact I couldn&#146t get the Camedia program to download at all -it kept telling me it couldn&#146t connect to the camera -  and I had instead to transfer files using Windows Explorer.  There is no option to preview and rotate images prior to download, and no option to automatically delete images from the camera&#146s memory card afterwards (again, all standard with the HP when connected via Windows 2000).  Not only that, but a really annoying feature of this camera is that, once you&#146ve downloaded and deleted a batch of images, it starts the next batch with the same file numbers.  This means that you can&#146t download consecutive batches of images into the same directory without manually renumbering every one in the second set.  This is a very basic and extremely aggravating deficiency.  In contrast, the HP 315 keeps track of numbering and starts file names for any new images with the next number in the sequence.  Simple and logical, right?  Why on earth Olympus couldn&#146t figure this one out is beyond me.

Once you have the images on your PC, the Camedia software&#146s display mode is vastly inferior to that of ACDSee.  It doesn&#146t allow one to easily move through photos (this can be done very easily in ACDSee with the mouse wheel) or to show full-screen images (again, a simple touch of the mouse wheel with ACDSee).

So all in all, I have serious buyer&#146s remorse.  This is all the more disappointing given that I have liked Olympus products in the past; I have two 20 year-old OM1 SLRs that still work well and take great photos, and also have a nice little Olympus point-and-shoot 35 mm.  I was prepared to suffer the inconveniences in the 3020's design on the assumption that I&#146d be getting better quality photos (or at least images that were comparable to those of my little old HP).  But I can&#146t even approach this without going to image quality settings that produce huge files - and even then the optical quality of the lens remains visibly inferior to that of the cheaper Hewlett Packard.  So essentially I paid $200 extra for manual controls, and even though I will often have to mess around with these to compensate for the camera&#146s deficiencies in automatic mode, I&#146ll still get lousy results.

In summary - and IF my experience was representative, which it may not have been - this is a camera to avoid.  If you really don&#146t need shutter speed control and other creative features, and instead want just a good quality digital that will be easy to use and give great results, go with a point and shoot.  I don&#146t even know if the HP 315 is still available, but if it is, grab one.  And if you want more than this, look elsewhere - if you&#146re going to spend $500 on a digital camera, there has to be something out there that&#146s better than this.
