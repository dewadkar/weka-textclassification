            The PT Cruiser is, in my opinion, one of the coolest looking cars out there. Chrysler deserves some applause for producing such a unique car at a price many car buyers can afford. (For my husband and I, it is our first new car.)

First of all, it's a really cute car. The unique retro style is very cool, and reminds you of a different era. Ours is silver, no frills, and, to me, it still stands out. The dashboard is neat, too, with the controls and displays matching the overall look. 

So far, it has also been very reliable. The only work we need to have done is the fuel seal, because of the recall. (While that may turn some people off, at least they <i> admitted </i> there's a problem...) 

What still blows me away about the PT Cruiser is the room inside. It can be parked in a compact space, but you can fit an amazing amount of stuff in it. For the longest time, when I'd get out of the car, I was under the impression it was a long way down, like in an SUV or truck. ^^ It's very open, and can carry just about anything.

My husband thinks it handles pretty well, and really enjoys driving it. (As for me, I like being seen in it. ^~) Though I've heard complaints about how long it takes to reach 60, and problems with wind noise, I don't notice. It's really a pretty quiet car. 

Also, since I must research everything to death before a purchase, we got a good price on our car. After looking around, I found a good (reputable!) dealership that offered our car about $1000 below sticker price. Even so, this is a really affordable car. Definitely worth the money, and then some!

Basically, I love our PT Cruiser. We've had it since around Christmas, and it still hasn't lost its novelty. It's a fantastic, unique car, and really fun!
