            There is an SUV out there that is the top of it's class. The Lexus LX 470 is a luxury family car. It is a perfect car for a family trip since it is so roomy. It has a great warranty and is known for its amazing safety. There are many options and it is very reliable. What else could you expect from a Lexus? It is an all terrain vehicle. The only problem with it is that it gets crummy gas mileage. It is very expensive, but it is worth every cent you put into it. So, if you want an SUV and you've got the money there is only one choice for you. This choice is the Lexus LX 470.<br><br>
