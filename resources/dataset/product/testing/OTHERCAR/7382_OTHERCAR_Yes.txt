            Like SAAB, the Subaru's parent company also makes aircraft. That might explain why they, alone in the volume production car world, still make their cars with boxer engines. This is only one way in which the Subaru differs from the run of the mill Japanese mid size car, and vive la difference too.

Most epinions reviewers are talking about the white hot WRX STi turbo model. Not me. I am reviewing the basic poverty pack GX, the cheapest car in the range. 

So, what did I get for my little amount of money? 

Rather a lot. The GX comes equipped with 5 speed manual, dual range, constant 4WD, ABS 4 wheel disc brakes, Michelin tyres, front and rear fog lights and a pretty good 2.0 litre 4 cylinder engine. Inside I get a six speaker single cd sound system, tacho, cloth seats, cruise control, power windows, power mirrors, front map lights, fade out interior lights, remote central locking and immobiliser and one cup holder (the forester has cup holders everywhere). What I didn't get was aircon; I had to pay extra for that option tick box. 

Style
Other reviewers, it seems, find the styling controversial, love it or hate it. You couldn't call it svelte. It's definitely not Italian design school. It's like my mum's Staffordshire bull terrier, chunky, ugly, but loveable anyway. I've grown to not dislike it and I prefer it to the previous model, how you view it is your choice. If nothing else it's functional, 4 wheels under a box, and it looks better in the metalflake silver flesh than it did in the brochure. I find the fore/aft roof rack mounting rails a boon. Fitted with a pair of Rola racks (the Sube option racks are a tad too unrefined for my taste) I use them to cart around hang gliders. The racks and mounts give no discernable wind noise at any speed, which is unusual. The weight of several gliders doesn�t trouble them  at all.

The office
Seated in the height adjustable driver's seat (works well) behind the tilt adjustable wheel, it's easy to get comfortable. Everything is in reach and visibility is good in all directions. The mirrors give a good view behind. In the last three months I've spent 10,000 kilometres in these seats sometimes up to 1000 Kms in a day. They get a thumbs up for good firm support. Most Japanese cars have the pedals a bit too close together, and here the Impreza doesn't disappoint. With my size 10 boots on I will catch my left foot under the clutch pedal every time if I rest it on the footrest, and snag my right boot under the brake pedal if I don't pay attention (that�s given me the odd fright I can tell you). Driven barefoot, which I prefer anyway, the pedal spacing and heights are just right. The controls' layout position and feel is typical Japanese, functional and solid. The variable intermittent 2 speed wipers/washer and rear washer/wiper are on the left stalk. Lights, headlamp dimmer and indicators are on the right stalk. This is opposite to the usual Euro layout, the only thing about the Sube that is more Japanese than European. The tacho and speedo dials are proper round 270 degree instruments and easy to read at a glance. The minor dials are 120 degree needles and similarly easy to read. The wheel is a good thickness for grip and the handbrake and gear lever fall easily to hand. When it comes to space, the hatch is more like a station wagon. Remove the luggage blind and fold down the rear seats and you have a pretty good load area. The rear seats seem OK, I haven't ever sat in them but passengers haven't complained.

Motor and drivetrain
The 4 cylinder 92Kw 184 Nm 16 valve MPinjected engine drives all four wheels via a five speed dual range gearbox. There is no centre diff locking, nor is it needed. The Oz spec engine will run on our 91RON unleaded fuel but is smoother on the 96-98RON premium unleaded. On paper the engine seems a little underpowered in the class. On the road it pulls strongly from under 1000 rpm to 3500 rpm where it picks up its skirts a bit. However, running it out to the 6200 redline doesn't produce startling acceleration. It isn't a slug, but it's not a firecracker either. It is very smooth at all revs, very tractable at all revs and retains only a hint of the flat four chaff cutter engine beat reminiscent of the old VW beetle. The five speed is notchy in all gears, which I don't mind, and the close shift pattern makes for finger tip gear changes. If it bothers you this notchiness can be reduced by refilling the transmission with a lower viscosity oil. Reverse is difficult to engage, baulks every time and needs force. It's easier if the car is nudged forward in 1st then snicked into reverse. Shifting when cruising laid back, where you are using low rev gear changes, the box is very smooth,. It is hard to know what use Subaru intended for the dual range. The low low gear is almost, but not quite, real 4WD stuff, but the car is clearly not intended for any off road work. It would perhaps be useful for steep driveways? Subaru's engine service intervals seem way too long apart for me. If I were keeping this car for the long haul I would double the number of engine oil changes at least. The long change intervals are to keep down running costs I suppose, but that would be false economy in the longer run. While we are talking about economy, I get around 500Km from a 40litre tank when cruising, and around 400 in town. This is about what Subaru claim and is good for a 2litre car of this mass. The shape must be more aerodynamic than it looks to be. 

Chassis and dynamics
Subaru are among the top dogs in the Rallysport world, and it shows right here. The Impreza chassis is a definite "best of breed". While the chassis itself is wonderfully rigid, the GX has a softer suspension setting than the up market sportier versions. This equates to a softer (read better) ride while retaining excellent roadholding. On anything like a smooth tarmac the car has only moderate road noise intrusion into the cabin. The handling and roadholding are close to superb, thanks in part to the AWD system. The handling is neutral at any legal road speed (and a long way beyond). Mid corner bumps/potholes don't faze the car at all. It is a 1st class long distance tourer (although the cruise control could be improved). The power steering is nicely done, not overboosted at all and the car has a very reasonable turning circle. Road feedback through the wheel is good too.
On gravel roads, where I spend a fair bit of my time, this car is without peer. Stable as a rock and absolutely free of scuttle shake over stutter bumps or holes. Ball bearing gravel can be driven over at speeds that would leave other cars swapping ends in your dust. This is thanks in full to the AWD system, the only way to go in these conditions. The Subaru's simple constant 4WD system makes competitors part time or "on demand" systems look like a joke, and don't even think of trying to keep up with the Sube in a front wheel drive vehicle. While we're on the dirt roads, it would be a good time to mention the ABS brakes. Unusually, they work very well in the dirt. Most ABS brakes do not cope at all well with gravel road conditions. The 4 disc brake system is very powerful and has nicely weighted progressive pedal feel. No complaints at all here. Also, while we are on the dirt, I should mention that the frameless windows do not leak a skerrick of dust into the cabin, and neither does the hatch back. And, after 10,000 Km, not a hint of a rattle or squeak. Very good mister Subaru. Oh, and the round headlights, which draw such style criticism, work very well both high and low beam. High beam performance is a combination of good close in spread coupled with bright light a long way out in front. Low beam has a sharp cutoff point and good light pattern spread. I would rather swap the useless (to me) standard fitment fog lights for a set of decent driving lights. Out here, dodging kangaroos (and other wildlife and domestic stock) at night is no joke. The standard lights are very good but achieve their good light distance in part by chopping the beam top low to the road. They could use a little bit of assistance.

At home
No doubt this car is in its element as a distance eater on any road surface. But at the same time the  large doors making entry and exit easy, the light yet positive clutch, good gearbox ,  good steering and unobtrusive motor make the car no chore to live with in town. If traffic jams are more your daily bind you could try the 4 speed auto box option. The hatch has a nice low loading lip, and keeps off the rain when you are unloading the grocery bags. As a shopping trolley or work/school taxi the Sube is as good as any, until, that is, it rains. Or snows. Or sleets. Because, when that happens the Sube is better than all others at anything like it�s price. You would have to be a long way beyond the twilight zone  to get into strife in almost any road conditions. 

To sum up
If you think I sound impressed, you would be right. This car is very safe, and more than capably fulfils its transportation role. Most of all, especially on a gravel road driving this car can be more fun than you should have while fully clothed. From my long association with many different Subaru vehicles, I know that it won�t rust out, and the engine and drive train will last seemingly forever.
So why only four stars? 
Well, the five star car hasn't been built yet, even though this one's close. Among my few gripes; the seat belt fixed stalk is about 50mm too low down beside the centre console, which makes buckling up a fiddle (although, on the plus side all 3 rear seat belts are triple point retractables). The battery is too small, how hard would it have been to fit a decent sized battery Subaru? There's plenty of room under the bonnet to do so. The pedals are too close together for a booted foot. The "point and shoot" central locking key is too fat to fit in my fob pocket. The stepping motor cruise control 'hunts' a bit around the set points and should be better  (in fairness this may be an adjustment). My major gripe is that an aircon system is not standard. Sure, this shaves 2 grand off the ask on a base model car, but it isn't possible to demist the windscreen any other way. This is a major safety factor to my way of thinking. And if you live in a hot climate, as I do, then the steeply raked windscreen focusing the sun on to an acre of dark plastic dashboard is like a three bar electric furnace in your face. Aircon is an option I knew I�d need and it works well. Climate control aircon is an option  too, but more expensive of course.  
 All in all, a minor list of gripes.
