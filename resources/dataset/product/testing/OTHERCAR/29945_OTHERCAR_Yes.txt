            We bought a Plymouth Voyager minivan new in '92, and kept it until an unfortunate accident ended its driving life in March, 2000. My wife loved the car, and used it to haul our Golden Retrievers to many dog shows. After the insurance settlement, we did a lot of reading and comparing, to see which of the current crop of minivans would serve as a replacement.
The Voyager had a few problems over the years. Most were minor and easily fixed, but the two most serious defects were the paint, which comes off in sheets once the clearcoat wears out, and the transmission, which went out at 60,000 miles, fortunately while the car was still under warranty. These problems were very typical for these vehicles, well documented on the internet and in various publications.
Still, these vans make the best use of interior space of any we have seen, allowing us to haul two or three dogs, plus their crates, plus a lot of equipment, after removing the rear seat and one of the quad seats. That's why the Daimler/Chrysler line of minivans are the main vehicle one sees in parking lots where dog shows are held.
This vehicle is far superior to our former van. It has the 3.8 liter V-6, which has only recently been available. The rear side vent windows are operable from the driver's seat. The driver's side sliding door is a HUGE improvement. I always wondered why vans didn't have these in the past.
Driving this van is a total pleasure. It is extremely comfortable, and has power to spare for hard traveling. It was a pretty good buy, too. We got it from one of the large national rental car chains, a 2000 SE model for $19,850, with only 9000 miles on it. Thank goodness, it didn't smell as if anyone had ever smoked in it! I hate to pay  $20,000 for ANY motor vehicle, but this one is a great value. I think any family would be well served by one of these great vans.
