            Since the day I learned to drive, I have been crazy about cars.  I have 3 brothers, but being the only girl, somehow my dad's obsession about cars rubbed off on me instead of the boys.  My dad was not one to play favorites with auto makers - if he liked it - he bought it.  From the time I turned 16 until now at age 30 - I have had over 23 different cars.  For the first few years, they were all used.  But at 20, my husband and I purchased our first new car - a Ford Thunderbird.  I was hooked.  Every year we bought a new Thunderbird, until 1998 when they quit making them.

We looked at Monte Carlos then, but decided on a Ford Explorer, because we had kids.  In 1999, I was ready for my car back.  We argued over what it would be, and I loved the look of the Monte Carlos.  Finally, I got him to the dealership to test drive one.  There were about 10 on the lot - many colors to choose from.  But I have always been one for the most gadgets.  The one that caught my eye was a black Z34 with everything.  Leather, cd, power sunroof - I loved it.  We drove home that day with our new car.  For the first month I was quite happy.  But then the smell started.  Literally - &quot;THE SMELL&quot;.  I called the dealership, told them that my car had a rancid smell.  They found a body seam leak.  My car was in the garage for 4 days - when it was returned - so was the smell.  I called the dealership, GM, and anyone else who would listen.  The leak was repaired, but the smell had made its way into every fiber of the interior.  I was furious.  The car was only months old and no one wanted to ride in it.  

To make a long story short, I again drive a Ford.  

It's a shame.  I liked the car, but GM's service sucks!!

Sorry Monte Carlo Fans!!<br><br>
