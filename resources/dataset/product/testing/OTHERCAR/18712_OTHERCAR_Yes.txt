            This review is for an Auto-trans. 1988 Legend Coupe.  At the time this review is being written, the car is close to 15 years old with 150,000 miles.  Most oil change places I visit are in disbelief that they are working on a car this old.

<b>Engine & drivetrain</b>
This has been a relatively problem free car.  The V6 3.2L engine runs as smoothly as it did the first year.  After all, this is a honda engine.  The 160 horsepower is merely adequate since there has been substantial increases to today's model cars but it can still reach 0-60 in just under 8 seconds.

The automatic transmission sometimes likes to hunt between 3rd and 4rth at inopportune times.  I typically like to shift between these gears myself.  This is not a big problem.  If I could choose, I'd want a manual instead but I've heard that the clutch on these models are susceptible to fairly quick wear.

<b>Interior appointments</b>
This car has far better visibility than any of the newer Acuras because when this model was released it was marketed for its small and unobtrusive window pillars and frameless windows.  Because of the age of this vehicle (and the fact that it has frameless windows), wind noise tends to seep in through the passenger-side window when travelling at speeds above 65 mph.

I own the non-L model so I don't have a leather interior.  The interior has aged well but the dashboard does have a slight 80's look though not nearly as bad as other cars from this era.

The analog guages are simple and purposeful.  No clutter here and the night time lighting is soft on the eyes.

The stereo has a 7-band equalizer.  These things were more popular in the 80's and personally, I don't think they accomplish much.  They take a substantial part of the center console where I would prefer to install an in-dash CD-player.

<b>Exterior</b>
The exterior has aged a little less gracefully.  In my opinion, it's the long-lipped bumpers.
On this car, rust has been a problem where I live.  Newer cars have galvanized bodies before paint is applied.

<b>Maintenance</b>
I don't get collision insurance on this vehicle.  If we ever trash it, I'll go out and buy a new car.  Maintenance on this vehicle has been very inexpensive due to infrequent visits to garages.  We'll probably keep this car until it can no longer move.  Unfortunately, that may be a very long time and with the amount of rust growing on this car annually, it probably won't look too great by then.
