            Back in June I completed an epinion on the Dodge Intrepid.  Spending a week driving across Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Iowa, I had covered some 1200 miles in the Dodge.  As I limped away from the car, clutching a hefty Chiropractic bill from a wrenched back due to a most uncomfortable ride, I knew then and there that a Dodge would not be in my future.  At least it wouldn't be a consideration until the manufacturer decided to provide lumbar support in the seats.

This August, I had the good fortune to do the week long drive across the great Midwest once again, this time in the 2001 Chevrolet Impala.  Not only is this an incredibly comfortable car, I found that it was able to with stand punishment beyond expectation as the Midwest temperatures have soared in the 100's these past two weeks.  When the air conditioning in my 1996 Ford Taurus took a nose dive due to the extreme temperatures, this Chevrolet Impala took the punishment and asked for more!

THE INTERIOR:

Let me tell you what I really loved about this car.  The interior design is one of the best I have seen in a full size American made automobile in a long time.  This car's interior reminds me of my old 1969 Chevrolet Impala - for those of you who are too young to remember, this was a time when the American car was a dream machine.  Big, roomy, and comfy, the American car of the past was made to practically live in!  

Chevrolet gave great attention to detail in this interior design.  The front and back seats are all equipped with lumbar support.  This translates into one heck of a comfy ride.  Taking a spin for eight hours on the freeway isn't necessarily a picnic, but at least in this car, you won't feel like you need to call 911 to pry you out of the front driver's seat.

The driver's seat is equipped with dual controls for maximum comfort in adjustment.  Not only is there a control for forward and backward movement, there is adjustments for the back part of the seat, and controls to adjust the height of the seat.  I have a problem with my legs falling asleep on long car rides, so I like to adjust the seat upward, closer to the ceiling, in order to give my legs that extra room to stretch.  I also think this maximizes circulation to the legs from the hip and tail bone (where you need it most).

The front and back seats can easily fit five adults (although Chevrolet claims six), I just can't imagine three people sitting in the front seat.  However, I can imagine five adults sitting comfortably in this car for several hours at a time.

The cruise control is with in easy reach, right on the steering wheel.  This is a one touch operation that doesn't require a degree in automotive engineering to set.  Just drive to the speed you desire, press the "set cruise" button and you are ready to roll!  A second button is clearly marked "resume" so you can get right back at the speed you desire after braking.

The car stereo is within easy reach of the driver's seat.  Controls are simple to use, with one touch control to find the station you want, adjust the volume, or make changes in bass, treble, or front and back speakers without having to pull out the owner's manual to figure it out.

The air conditioning is simple to adjust and quite powerful.  The entire interior of the car cools down with the air conditioning on, not just the front seat.  I don't like it when people in the back seat are suffering from the heat, or the folks in the front seat have to freeze in order to cool down the back.  Apparently, the folks at Chevrolet don't like this either!

The rear defogger control is easy to find, right next to the air conditioning controls.  The defogger gets down to business in short order, no need to wait around for visibility in the back window on this car.

The exterior rearview mirrors are incredibly easy to adjust.  The electric control lever is conveniently located above the electric window controls on the driver's side.  The control panel is clearly marked and provides one touch operation to get the view desired.

I love the keyless entry on this car.  I noticed it is quite powerful and delivery of the lock/unlock or trunk open command can be done from quite a far distance.  The keyless entry pad has extra large buttons with the commands clearly written.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure this one out!

THE EXTERIOR:

The 2001 model isn't much of a change from the 2000 design.  This is a nice looking car.  Well curved and pleasing to the eye, this car has the look of a nice family sedan.  The doors provide ample room for getting in and out.  The back seat is easy to access with no problem getting packages in and out.  The height from seat to ceiling is comfortable and roomy, even for larger and taller folks.  

The tail lights are extra large and no doubt easy to view for those behind you.  The headlights are automatically on when you start the car.  I think this is a great feature, as having the headlights on, even in the day time is a wise idea, especially when driving hilly or curvy roads.

This car is equipped with a 3.4 liter, V6 engine.  The Impala has excellent pick up.  I noticed even driving at 65 mph, this car feels like it is just getting warmed up.  The Impala screams to go faster.  I found myself pushing past 75 mph several times, hence the cruise control is a good idea, least you get a speeding ticket!

I would have to say the only down side to this car was that I didn't like the way it took curves when going down hill.  It is definitely wise to slow down when taking sharp curves with this car.

This car has the following as standard equipment:
Air Conditioning, Driver Air Bag, Passenger Air Bag, Anti-Theft Vehicle, Rear Defogger, Power Locks, Power Mirrors, Power Steering, Power Windows, AM/FM Radio, Cassette, Anti-Theft Radio, Tilt Steering, and Automatic Transmission.  

The Impala has a fuel economy of 21 mpg in the city and 32 mpg on the highway.  Given the size of the car and the engine, this is exceptional gas mileage!  Chevrolet offers a standard 3 year or 36,000 mile warranty with 72 months or 100,000 miles on body rust.  

If this Impala is as dependable as the Impala's made in the 1960's and 1970's, this car could well be in your driveway for years to come!  Happy trails!
