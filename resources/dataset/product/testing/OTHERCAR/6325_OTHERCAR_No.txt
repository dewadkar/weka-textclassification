            Three years ago we decided we were ready for a commitment.  We had the marriage...we had the children...we had the dog and the cat...it was time for THE MINIVAN!

So we did what every single person does...we read every review and went from dealer to dealer (like hitting the singles bars looking for &quot;Mr. Right&quot;).  Then I fell in love at first drive.  The Toyota Sienna....and we married her immediately.

We loved the power.  Unlike most minivans, it doesn't take 5 minutes for it to register that you've hit the accelerator and want to go.  And two doors!  Oh goody!  But we didn't stop there...leather interior, sunroof, gold package, we did the works.

It was a good relationship, until the day my son tried to open the door, and couldn't.  Wasn't locked, and couldn't be opened.  Well, this isn't right.  A trip to the dealer (and an overnight vacation at the dealers) allowed our door to open again (we also told him about our squeaky dashboard...and he said that was a common complaint), but it was a shortlived fix.  Soon we had to tug-tug-tug-tug on the door before it would open.  Back the dealer we would go...and bring home a minivan that we had to tug-tug-tug the door to open.  But it didn't stop there...that would be too easy.  Now it had to make it so that the door wouldn't stay open unless you slowly and forcefully pushed it back and held it open...pretty impossible for a 3 year old boy to do, especially on a hill, and especially when his head gets in the way of the door that won't stay open smashing its way closed.  My son thought the car was trying to eat him!

Now, besides the squeaky dashboard, we also noticed a distinct grinding and squealing everytime we stopped.  I was worried, since previous relationships I had been burned this way.  Usually that noise made me suspect bad brake pads, and I learned that when a partner suspects her vehicle of bad brakes, she's usually correct.  So I had the car checked out.  The investigator came back and told me that my brakes were just fine, but they always sound like that.  Really! I had never heard that noice before!  The grinding continued, making me worry enough to return the car to be investigated once again.  Again I was assured that this was normal.  Normal to squeek and grind?  I began to wonder if there was something funny going on between my car and the investigator.

So now I had a door that wouldn't work, a squeak in the dashboard, and brakes that sounded like they were grinding the rotors.  I tried to work out our relationship...after all, it's only a door, right?  We have to expect glitches in our relationships and be willing to work through them.  We tried 2 1/2 years of counseling with our dealer, but we weren't finding a solution.

Then there was the time we actually had adult company over and we all wanted to go out to the same place at the same time in the same vehicle.  I spoke with pride and glee, &quot;Lets take our minivan!  The passenger door doesn't work, but there's one just like it on the other side!&quot;  So into my vehicle we piled!  Two adults in the front, two small children in the middle, and two adults in the back.  Little did we know that those back seats were for looks and not <b>actually</b> meant to carry real live adults.  Every pothole...every speed bump....every intersection...BAM would bottom out the back. BAM..BUMP...
Lets just say that the backseat passengers didn't eat much for dinner and seemed to have a body image problem for quite a while.  I had a talk with my Sienna the next day...I told her that I thought she was being rude, but she never felt the need to change and told me that she would never feel comfortable riding two real live average sized adults in the back.

So lets talk about the children in the back.  One attractive feature to me was the dual control system...how lovely to be able to control the back and the front separately!  Until the day I was driving with my child in the back, the weather had gone from pretty cold to pretty darn warm...and I went to turn the rear air on for my son.  Whoops!  It was still on &quot;heat&quot; from earlier that morning.  Umm...now we have a problem. The control to turn it to air conditioning is ... back... there...somewhere...and I can't seem to reach them from my front seat without completely twisting my body around (difficult to do while on the freeway!).  So I began to wonder...could I really and truly be the first person who ever wanted to be able to change the temperature from the front??  My son remained a little warmer than he would have preferred to be that day.

Ok...so I was having a problem with her not really letting me in, couldn't adjust the rear air while driving, and she had a problem with my friends.  But then there was the day we went television shopping.  I know couples often have trouble when choosing big items like televisions...but she made it very difficult.  Here I am, all proud of my purchase and about to share it with her, and I open up the back....and there is about 3&quot; of space in which to put my television.  I'll be honest...about half of me wanted to take them back seats out and leave them in the parking lot.  After all, nobody older than 5 can ride in them anyways, right!  But I didn't want to litter in the parking lot, so instead I travelled all the way home, removed the backseats, and returned to the store (some hour or so later) to get my television.

I tried for this relationship, I really did!  And I was loyal!
  ......until!!

One day I was talking to a friend of mine about  minivans and happened to mention that my eyes were straying.  I said that recently I began to fantasize about other vehicles...and admitted that I even was thinking about test driving another vehicle.  I lowered my head in shame and admitted to her that my lovely Sienna whom I had fallen in love with 3 years ago, was beginning to not look as good to me.  She assured me that it's normal to look at other vehicles....and then began to tell me about one that sounded too good to be true.  We talked in a shadowed room about the Odyssey....a minivan with doors that work!  I told my friend that I still have strong feelings for my van...and why.  Every benifit that my minivan gave me, this Odyssey vehicle seemed to have also.  But it also does tricks....like if you purchase something spontaneously, you can fold the back seat so that it's completely hidden!  Really!?  And it holds real adults??  And the middle bucket seats can slide together to make a bench if you want it to??  I thought she was lying.

But one dark night, my husband and I crept down to a Honda dealer to have a look.

That night we agreed to a divorce...and put money down on an Odyssey.  And we have been happy ever since.  I know that it takes a lot of courage to admit when you made a mistake and to leave a relationship like that, and we are better people for it.  Our Odyssey treats us the way we think we deserve to be treated, and we are currently living happily ever after.<br><br>
