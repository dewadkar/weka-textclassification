            <b>FIRST IMPRESSION:</b>
Pretty sharp... I grew attached to the looks of the previous version of the GTI.  I remember watching a Volkswagen (VW) GTI commercial which featured Speed Racer and his sidekicks, racing his enemies and blowing 'em away in their VW GTI VR6.  It was awesome.  The new style of GTIs will take some getting used to.  The rear portion of the vehicle doesn't really catch much attention, but the front definitely shows a smooth ride with a flare for excitement.  The GTI VR6 edition boasts the ever-so-popular VR6 engine that pushes out some hefty figures and carries it from 0 to 60 in less than 7 seconds.  I had to take it for a spin!

<b>FIT &amp; FINISH:</b>
Bravo for VW with their excellent choice of material for its interior.  The dash looks and feels like the ones you'll find in more expensive European vehicles.  The body molding is also very well put together with the gaps between each panel hardly noticeable.  The steering wheel is leather-wrapped, the front seats are very supportive, and the instrument panel and stereo glows with its blue back-lighting and the instrument needles contrast in ravishing red.  This car just screams, &quot;buy me!&quot;

I own a 1999 VW Passat, so hopping into the GTI felt very much the same in that the layout and design was alike.  The key is unique.  It is center-cut and is housed by the remote-keyless entry unit.  You press a button and the key flips out kind of like a switch-blade.  Pretty cool.  The GTI VR6 also has 16&quot; alloy wheels with 205/55 performance tires.  

<b>PERFORMANCE:</b>
Driving the GTI VR6 was like being treated out to fine desert.  The 5-speed transmission was fairly responsive and first gear transitioned smoothly into second even after 30 MPH.  I took it for all it was worth and brought it to a steady 70 MPH in 4th gear.  Nice.  The stock, stiffer than normal suspension was fit for the type of car (fast &amp; sporty) and would probably not be suited for people searching for a Lincoln Towncar-type ride.  I'm sure that upgrading the GTI with some Eibach struts and suspension would make this car handle even better.  Cornering was just a joy.  Braking was even solid and once you start driving the GTI for a long period of time, you and the car become ONE.  Now that's a definition of a good car.

<b>ENGINE TYPES:</b>
The GTI comes in three types of models: <b>GLS</b>, <b>GLS 1.8T</b>, and <b>GLX</b>.  The GLS comes with the 4-cylinder, 2.0 liter engine that pushes out 115 horsepower with the ratio of torque enabling it to accelerate and climb very well.  The GLS 1.8T houses the 4-cylinder, 20 valve, 1.8 liter turbo engine that gives it 150 horsepower.  This engine was first introduced for VW in the 1999 Passat GLS.  The GLX comes with the very famous VR6 engine.  It is a 6-cylinder engine with a very sharp 15 degree V angle that gives it the special name and the unique power.  This engine produces 174 horsepower which is very well used.  This engine is strongly recommended.  

<b>PRACTICALITY:</b>
The GTI is a 2-door hatchback.  It's a perfect car for two people wanting to take a road-trip.  The hatchback is more than useful in transporting various equipment (golf clubs, skis, snowboards, etc.), bags (suitcases, backpacks, etc.), or a load of books and a basket of laundry...(college students, especially).  The seats are very supportive and prevents you from sliding side-to-side.  The Monsoon stereo system sounds great for stock.  It's powered by a separate amp and the face greets you with a pleasant dot-matrix display.  The 8-speakers are quite nice, as well.

<b>WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE BAD ABOUT THE GTI?</b>
Well, it's pretty hard to say, but there are a few things.  Besides how beautifully it accelerates, handles the road, and comes with so many features, it has its downfalls.  The size of the GTI is not suitable for large people in the back seat.  It's quite cramped.  Talking about seats, the front seat backs are a pain to adjust.  It's great that you can fine-tune it, but if you're planning on reclining to snooze for a few minutes at a rest stop, forget it.  You'll probably end up straining your wrists from trying to turn the dial in order to recline the seats a degree or two.  Another trait that may hinder some from buying this car is the insurance rates, especially with the GLX model.  Let's just say that it's bad enough to make you look at other options when considering buying the GTI (especially when you're under 21).  But by far, the thing that bothers me most about the GTI, or should I say Volkswagen for that matter, is the warranty they offer.  They offer one of the worst bumper-to-bumper warranties in the business: a mediocre 2 year/24,000 mile warranty.  Although, they offer the 10 year/100,000 mile powertrain warranty and the 12 year/unlimited mileage rust/corrosion warranty, the short bumper-to-bumper warranty makes you raise your eyebrow.  It seems like they just threw in the 2 year/unlimited mileage roadside assistance to cover it up.  In any case, the car sells for itself.  

<b>SUMMARY:</b>
Volkswagen is coming back strong in the US.  The VW engineers probably spent countless nights burning the midnight oil and it shows in the GTI VR6.  I recommend this car to anyone who shares a passion for fine automobiles.  This car really defines the term of <i>reading the road</i> and as mentioned earlier, the car grows on you the more you drive it.  For the way it performs, it's definitely worth the money.  You can pick up a GLX model for around $22,500 (+/- $1,000).  You'll be amazed.  I strongly urge you to go to the nearest VW dealership to test drive this bad boy.  

With the recent introduction of the new Beetle, the newly designed Passat, the ever-so-popular Jetta, and the fun-loving GTI, VW has built a strong reputation as being the company that advertises: <b>DRIVERS WANTED</b>.    <br><br>
