            I purchased this camera about 6 months ago so that I could supplement my auction descriptions and to shoot photos of 3 dimensional items that I could not run through the scanner. It came highly rated to me through an auction e-mail newsletter that I subscribe to - what a smart decision I made on it's purchase.

Price was definately a factor and this camera was among the lower price range with high positive feedback from other users. The ability of being able to view the pictures immediately instead of waiting for the PC download appealed to me and was the 2nd factor in consideration.

It is extremely easy to use and I was able to begin immediately (I admit that I am not one who is big on reading the instruction manual from cover to cover).

This camera features red-eye reduction, a self-timer, 3 different picture qualities, auto-focus or manual focus options, multi-photo preview, slide show. The photo processing software is easy to use as well, giving you the ability to make some changes but not all, to the original photo quality. Camera to PC download time is fairly efficient.

Boy, does this thing eat batteries! Thank goodness the HP Photo Smart C-30 comes with an AC adapter - Thanks HP!

One thing that I do find irritating is the size and depth inset of the various buttons...while I don't have really large fingers, I do find that the small size and indentation of the buttons on the camera body make it difficult to select what you want.
