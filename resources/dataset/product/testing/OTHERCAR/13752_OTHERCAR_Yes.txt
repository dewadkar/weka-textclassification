            I'm a digicam newby, so I have no basis for comparison, but I love this camera!  One salesperson at BestBuy said the pictures would have a red tinge to them, but the color quality looks perfect to me.  I don't know barrel distortion or the other technical aspects from a hole in the head.  I only know what I can see, and what I see is just superb.  If anything, the picutures are too colorful and sharp.  I'm kind of used to the fuzzy analog-ness of a regular camera.  But if I want that look, I just add it in PhotoShop!  

The one thing that did take me by surprise was the wait time between pictures.  It seems dramatic because the LCD turns off for a second, but in reality it's no worse than the cycle time for the flash on a regular camera, and this camera has a three-shot burst mode that helps eliminate that problem if you're shooting fast-moving subjects (like our three-year-old).  

The movie function is really great, too.  Movie length is only limited by the memory available.  We're about to have our second baby and we just learned the hospital won't allow camcorders anymore. But they don't care about cameras!!!!  

Memory sticks are great; price is not much higher than other media if you shop around (try Dell), and Memory Stick Pro can go up to 1 gig!  

Lastly, this camera takes 2 x AA batteries.  Everyone seems to have their own philosophy on batteries, but I think AA is best.  They're cheap and readily available.  Battery life has been excellent, even with the LCD on all the time.

I haven't used the accompanying software much yet.  Image Mixer will likely be handy tho.  I can make personalized CDs with pix and movies for friends and family.

I bought a SanDisk ImageMate for dumping the pix into my computer.  It's cheap (less than $20) and works like a charm.  Highly recommended.

I have an old camcorder from Sony and it just keeps going and going.  This is made in Japan and feels very high-quality. I expect it to last as long. 

It's really a great camera!
