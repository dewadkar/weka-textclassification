            This Jeep is so sweet.  It's basically a Grand Cherokee before they had Grand Cherokees.  Leather, power everything, abs, 4wd, part and full time.  But there are some drawbacks, if you're a young guy like me.  The main thing is that it has a towing package.  This sounds good, but that means the power steering is overasisted, so if you've driven a Grand Cherokee, don't expect to be able to tork this thing around the same way.  Also, if you buy it used, expect it to have been used to tow things.  So look for those problems.  For instance scorched brakes, and i even had a broken flywheel.  It's an American car, so there'll probably be a few oil leaks, make sure and get that checked out too.  It comes with a Jensen six speaker stereo system, so you'll be able to hear the stereo over the powerful inline 6 cyl. 190hp engine.  I just drove it in the snow the first time the other day, and it was great. Just don't try it without the 4wd engaged.  Overall though, I bought this car for long road trips from MD to VT, which i frequently take to snowboard, and it's great for that.  Comfortable, roomy, everything a Grand Cherokee is these days, but for cheaper.  I love it. <br><br>
