            The new Jetta is  a driver's car. I spent over a month researching the next vehicle I would purchase. I looked at the Jetta last, and to my supprise, i saved the best for last. I settled on the GLS model with a manual shift transmission. I also opted for the winter package which includes heated seats! The other options included on the vehicle were leather, alloy rims, sun roof, CD player and power everything. The car is a dream to drive. However, the only downside is that on the highway the car tends to run at a higher rpm than I would like. A small price to pay for such a great and fun driving experience. Finally, the warranties! The Jetta has a protection plus powertrain plan that provides 10 years or 100,000 miles of protection, whichever comes first. I did find a large difference in price when shopping at different Volkswagon dealers-so do your homework. I bought my new Jetta for $2200.00 below invoice and I am very satisfied...Good luck -Driver's wanted!! <br><br>
