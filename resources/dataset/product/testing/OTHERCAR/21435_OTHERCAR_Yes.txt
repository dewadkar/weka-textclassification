            When our 1996 Ford Taurus had reached 110,00o miles, we decided that it was time to get a new car.  Not wanted to spend a ton of money, we looked at Hyundai.  Being a bit skeptical of the Hyundai name I was pleasantly surprised when I started reading reviews.
  The Elantra is a great ride.  I was concerned because we were moving from a 6 cylinder to a 4.  There really is not too much of a difference.  The Elantra is extremely quiet even when cruising down the highway.  We have no problems hearing the kids in the back seat.  All of the controls are easy to get at.  The standard factory stereo with tape deck sounds great.
  Another thing I was impressed with was the size of the trunk.  I expected a small trunk.  We went away the weekend after we bought the car and had no problem packing everything for a family of 4.
  I have only one complaint when it comes to the Elantra.  The flip down sun visor does not work very well when you turn it to block your side window.  It points up and doesn't do a good job blocking the sun.  Also the rear leg room can be a bit tight if you have kids in car seats.  The kids find it far to easy to push on the front seats with their feet.
  The car comes with a 10 year/100K mile warranty.  It also comes with free roadside assistance for 5 years.  You can't beat that!
  Overall I am very happy with our Hyundai.  I expect that we'll be purchasing another one sometime in the future.
