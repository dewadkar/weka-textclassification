            I only wanted to spend $300-350 for a digital camera.  I wanted 1.0+ megapixel and Optical Zoom, so my choices were limited.  The A50 is a great LITTLE camera...literally &quot;pocket size&quot;.  During my research, many people did not like to shutter delay when taking pictures, however, if you READ the manual, you will have no problems.

One problem I see (for people taking a lot of pictures) is the lack of USB support.  The bundled software is good, but only uses a serial connection.  For picture happy people, I would recommend a card reader with this camera.

Outside picture quality is excellent.  Indoor picture quality is good but limited due to a smallish flash.

Finally, picture taking in AUTO mode is easy, but be prepared to wade through many menus for MANUAL settings.<br><br>
