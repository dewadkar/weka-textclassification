             My rrspect for nissan is large. I have always enjoyed their vehicles.However I think they took a while to get things right. The 87 truck I bought seemed to be a nice little truck.It held it's value very well and had just gotten a head gasket replaced and some work had been done on the valves when I bought it.96,000 miles.
  I bought it from a Nissan dealership and owned it for 2 years. In that time I replaced all four shocks(normal) the exhaust (normal) tires (normal). Basic items that it needed.The only problem is when you pay 8,000 for a vehicle you would hope that it would run for a bit before you have to do all this to it.It was under 100,000 miles and all this came at once within a couple months of owning it.That sucked. The worst thing about this truck was not that the transmission went out after a year and had I not taken it out and put it in would have cost close to $2000.No. The worst thing about this truck is the engine.The 2.4L Z@$ engine is a horrid little 4cyl. It never ran right.It always had a bouncy idle. Like I had said,the head gasket and valves had been redone at 96k.The power was ok.Replacement parts...high cost and difficult to find. Keep in mind you need 8 wires and plugs on this 4 cyl.
 I traded the truck off at 133,000 right after I had put the transmission in it. That dealership sold it for 5,000 bucks to a kid who called me up after buying it saying how it needed a valve job and head gasket and he wondered if I had known about it. That made me greatful to have dumped it.
