            I have had the RX300 for 18 months. Unfortunately, there are still another 18 months left on the lease. It is a fully loaded version: integrated phone; upgraded stereo; etc.

This is without a doubt one of the more annoying vehicles I have owned. When I hear it described as a &quot;luxury vehicle&quot; I can only wonder if the reviewer has ever driven a car that really lives up to that designation.

I was attracted by the styling, with I still believe is first rate. However, let's face it, this is a four wheel drive Camry. While it is a fine utilitarian auto (my wife is on her second one and loves it), it is by no stretch in the luxury, or even &quot;upscale&quot; class.

This suv has any number of serious design flaws and poor ergonomics. That there was a lot of cost cutting is obvious after a brief break in period. The wind and road noise are atrocious. Mysterious squeaks come and go. Brake squeal sets in after only a few months.

As an example of the cost cutting debacles: there is only one switch for the heated front seats. Your options are to heat either the driver's seat, or both the driver and passenger seats. What happens when your wife is the passenger and chronically cold. Well, either you are a gentleman and turn on her seat heater while you roast uncomfortably; or, you suffer the consequences of being ungentlemanly.

There are at least a dozen other instances of cheapness and poor construction that spoil what the exterior promises: a stylish, sporty, fun suv.<br><br>
