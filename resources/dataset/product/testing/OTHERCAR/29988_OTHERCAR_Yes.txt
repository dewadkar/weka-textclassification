            Let me start this review by saying that I may be slightly biased in my views about the Spyder because I have been wanting one for so long.  I've been researching and test driving this car for about 3 years.  When I bought this car, I traded in my old 1994 Plymouth Laser.  While a Plymouth automobile, it had a Mitsubishi motor and had similar qualities to the Eclipse of that year.  Excluding normal maintenance, the Laser lasted me for 5 years with only one serious trip to the repair shop (brakes & rotors).  With this in mind, I felt comfortable about the reliability of these kind of cars.

<b>Overview</b>

The Spyder that I own is a 2002 GT with the Premium Options package.  I went with the silver color.  The seats are black leather with a black convertible top.  The sound system is an Infinity with 4-disk in-dash CD changer and cassette.

<b>4-Cylinder v/s V6</b>

I've test driven the 4-cylinder a few times and doesnt even come close to the power that the V6 has.  For me, the additional price was worth this extra power.

I opted for the automatic instead of the manual transmission.  I frequently drive on long trips, so the cruise control is a must.  The automatic has the SportTronic shifter.  This allows you to manually shift the car as if it were a manual transmission.  I havent really cared for this feature because the car will still downshift by itself.  To me this feature does not make much sense.

<b>Power everything</b>

Everything in this car is power.  It has power windows and power seats.  Unlock the convertible top and push one button to put the top down and roll down all of the windows.  One peculiar thing about the convertible top is that when you put the top back up it doesnt automatically roll up the windows.

One problem that I have recently have is that when the temperature outside gets below freezing, I often have problems rolling down my window.  For some reason, it freezes shut.  This happens even if there is no ice on the car.  It is a little inconvenient when you want to run through the drive through in the morning to grab a cup of coffee on the way in to work.

<b>Leg room</b>

This isnt a practical car for a family.  Only small children will fit in the back seat.  I'm still a bachelor, so, besides my girlfriend, I dont have any other family members to get in the car.

There isnt much trunk space in this car.  You will be able to fit a small suitcase or a couple of gym bags.  It is still big enough to fit groceries.

<b>Sound System</b>

As mentioned earlier, the Spyder has an Infinity sound system with a 4-disk in-dash CD changer and cassette.  The display for the radio is in the middle of the dash.  This was a little hard to get used to at first but has been convenient because you dont have to take your eyes too far from the road to see the clock, cd track, or radion station number.

The sound quality of this system is very good.  When you test drive, be sure to bring a CD along with you.  Listening to the radio is not a good example of the quality of this system.

<b>Driving</b>

The Spyder has a very smooth ride.  For a convertible, there is very little road noise.  With the top down, there wasnt as much wind as I had anticipated.  The car is slightly larger than my old Laser, so I'm still getting used to lining it up correctly when I pull into parking spaces and parallel parking.  The turning circle is slightly larger.

<b>Summary</b>

In all, this is an awesome car.  I have been very pleased with my purchase.  I highly recommend it to someone who wants a fun car to drive.
