            Of all the LH cars, this is the best. It is the cheapest, and the most conservatively styled. Since it is a Dodge, the interior is very different from its Chrysler counterparts. If you like the Chrysler 300M, look at the Intrepid R/T. They have the same engine and many of the same options. 

The base 2.7 liter engine is large enough for this car, giving in 200 horsepower. That's not a huge amount of power, but this car isn't underpowered either. And, how many people are going to drag race with an Intrepid?

For a family, this car is a good value, and has many of the basics. A/C, radio, and the options found on the Chrysler versions. The wheelbase is huge, and gives the car great interior volume. The headroom in front and back is great, and the car just feels cavernous. In the version I was in, there was no cigarette lighter, just a power outlet. This enables you to use the outlet for a CD player, but not to smoke. The back seat is a little to vertical, but the space is very large. The styling looks weird, but not as weird as the Concorde. Dodge is known as the budget, sporty division of Chrysler, and the Intrepid lives up to this.

The front seats are very supportive. Their lower back support keeps you in the seat, and they are still comfortable. This really helps going around turns, and is just nicer than sliding all over the seat. The steering and handling are supportive; not superior, and not terrible. 

But, these cars are very similar, its a good idea to look at all of them before you decide to buy one. Most of the components are the same; it's the price and looks that really play a big role in your choice.
