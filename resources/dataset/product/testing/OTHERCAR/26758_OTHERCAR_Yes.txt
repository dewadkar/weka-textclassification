            I looked and tried several of the top brand named models of cameras in price ranges from several hundred dollars to over a thousand. The Olympus D-360L performed as well or better than some of the higher priced models.
It is very user friendly,easy to follow instruction book,software included.You do not have to be a camera expert to get the great results this camera delivers.I photograph items that I put on my auction site and the results were better than using my scanner.It takes less time and expense as you do not have to buy film,have it developed and then run the hard copy through the scanner.With this camera,you take your picture and view it right away on the viewer, if the picture is not what you want, trash it and take another.
I could go on and on,however, I highly recommend that if you are interested in a digital camera, you look this one over first.
