            1997 Mazda Protege 4 dr LX

My wife owned a 1992 Mazda protege and it was a decent car.(Other than the hubcaps kept on falling off) But overall it was a good car. When the new 1997 came out, she was ecstatic! I went car shopping with her and she decided on a beautiful black protege with tan interior. We bought the car brand new (17 miles) and here's my take on it:

Amenities:

The 1997 Protege 4 dr LX comes with Power windows (Auto down on driver's window), Cruise control, Power locks with multiple or single door lock feature,(quick turn unlocks driver side only, hold key and all doors unlock), a rather nice-sounding factory system with AM/FM cassette and CD player. 6X9 coaxials in the rear and 6 1/2s in the front. Steering tilt, 2 cupholders, rear window defrost, ABS, Dual aribags, Overdrive feature, Folding rear seat for trunk access, trunk light, tire spare storage, center storage console with armrest. Everything is placed nicely and easily accessible/understandable.

Ride/Comfort:

I definitely have to commend this car's ride comfort. I was very pleased with the quietness and smoothness of the Protege's ride. At highway speeds it sails with no vibration and virtually no highway or wind noise. Absorbs bumps and potholes with almost no notice of them. Seats are very comfortable as well. Supports lower lumbar and head rests are well placed. Everyone always compliments this car's comfort and quiet ride. Two thumbs up!

Performance:

The Protege LX is equipped with a 16 valve 4 cylinder 1.5 liter DOHC engine. Automatic transmission. Only 92 hp, but comes with optional 122hp ES model (my wife drives VERY slow so she was not concerned with horsepower) Acceleration is rather poor. Takes approximately 9 seconds from 0-60. Ugh! Won't do over 110 mph downhill! The Protege obviously sacrifices performance for comfort. The car body tends to lean dramatically in hard cornering, the tires tend to roll and squeal as well. (185/65/14) Braking is average. This should suit less aggressive drivers just fine. It performs as it was designed to perform. 

Space:

The Protege is a well thought out car and provides plenty of room to get comfortable. I'm 6'1 and have more than enough room. Ample leg space, head room etc. Adults can fit comfortably in the rear seat as well with room for seat adjustments. Trunk space is deep but narrow. Baby strollers and such fit nicely. 

Durability: 

The panels of the protege are pretty solid you don't have to worry about getting too close with the car wash wand or anything. Everything is still solid inside and out. No rattling, humming, whizzing or buzzing noises. Car is well put together. 

Reliability: 

Now here is where I have some serious issues. Like I said we bought the car with only 17 miles on it. At 24,000 the car started smoking. Between 24,000 and 42,000 miles we took it to the dealer for an increasingly worsening smoking problem on 7 separate occasions. Every time we took it to them they said they couldn't find anything wrong. Finally at about 47,000 miles the car throws a rod and the engine is ruined. Despite the 50,000 mile warranty, Mazda refused to replace the engine. They demanded oil change receipts which I didn't have. I do most of the oil changes myself and the rest we had done at Econo Lube and Tune which had undergone new management and disposed of their archives. The dealer wanted $4000 to install another engine so we got a used engine with 28,000 miles on it (purchased and installed) for $1200. I am not impressed in the least with this particular car's reliability. I had routine oil changes and everything, this engine had absolutely no reason to go out. What car starts smoking at 24,000 miles anyway?!! I think we got a lemon because I know Mazda makes good cars that last. 

I would possibly still recommend this car because of Mazda's reputation and my wife's last Mazda was a good car. My recommendation is riding on these two facts alone! I think we just got the bad end of the deal this time around. Good luck with yours! :-)
