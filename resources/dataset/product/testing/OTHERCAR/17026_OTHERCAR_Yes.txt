            I have been driving Barney (my purple Durango) since November 1997.
I originally looked at the Durango as a big square BOX, but boy once in it and once you drive it, lookout your are really in for more room inside than you could ever dreamed possible.  Eight of us went to Atlantic City in Barney comfortably and without body cramps.

I loved the color that Dodge selected. It is bright, sharp and a clean cutting Sport Utility Vehicle.  Its handling ability is far superior to the Ford Explorer. I use to have one of them.  You can take your Durango on the beach and in 4 x 4 it handles beautifully like silk on sand. 

Why would you want another Sport Utility Vehicle vehicle sitting in your driveway when you can have the top of the line.  See it, drive it take it home.<br><br>
