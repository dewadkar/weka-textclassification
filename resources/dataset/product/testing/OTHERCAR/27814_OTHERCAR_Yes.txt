            I bought the PowerShot S100 as a Christmas present for myself because I loved its size, stylish looks and features. I also wanted a camera that would take good close-up shots, and the S100 has a macro feature (range of 4 inches to 22 inches). It also has an infinity mode so you can shoot landscapes and distant objects.

The default resolution setting is 1600x1200. If you change to a lower resolution (640x480), the image quality settings are saved when the power is turned off.

You can also adjust the exposure compensation as well as set the white balance -- helpful when you're shooting in a place with fluorescent lighting or in a cloudy setting.

What I don't like about the PowerShot S100 is the battery life. I took the camera to a cousin's wedding, and the fully charged lithium battery died after about four hours. If you don't carry a spare battery or the recharger, you will be out of luck.

I've had quite a few prints made from the PowerShot S100, from different online sites. Most of the pictures have turned out really well. If you shoot at the 1600x1200 resolution, you can have prints made up to 8x10 or possibly bigger with no loss of quality.
