            212,453.9 miles, YES. You did not read it wrong.
I own a 1986, 740 Turbo Wagon, with over 200,000 miles on it.  

She(my baby) has gotten my family to Florida, New Hampshire, Ohio, and many other places in the United States as well as Prince Edward Island, Canada.
I belive that she might be on her last leg, but still she gives me what I ask for and more. 
Even after she hit her big 200 she still gives me many memories. Midnight drives to the beach, weekend trips to P.A. and day trips to the Amusement Park, my baby has taken me every where.  She might not like the hills, and she does not like the cold, but she takes care of me and my daughter.  I try my best to keep her healthy, but at her age, many things are going wrong.  Her turbo is original, and it does not act like a spring chickens, but i do not hear her complain.  Her cluth is getting sensitive and it seems to bother her, but that too is as old as she.  Her gas gage forgets how much gas you have, but with her tripodometer to back you up we live with the forgetfulness.  She seems to be getting slower, so I try to keep her out of traffic.  But with age these things are expected.
My baby will take me where I want to go, and until that last gasp for gas I will not pass up the chance to take her somewhere. (if she dies on the way, that is what AAA is for.)
