            Look at my sample pictures.

Here are samples of my first shot with new C-750.

(1.4MB. look at the focus and blur around the object. I focused to number 32 that is in a circle in the picture. isn't it really great?)



---------------

First of all, 

I'm really impressed by this camera.

10x optical zoom + 4MP.

I know it's not easy with this body size.

If you visit a store, and you will see many cameras say "12 X zoom or 16X  "digital" zoom.

Trust me. you will love only optical zoom, and you will hate the digital zoom.

so, 10x zoom, it will bring you a pleasure to take pictures.

without 10x zooming, you have to move out from your seat to take your daughter's pictures in her school concert.

and 750 says it's 4MP.

but I really don't believe it. because it looks like a 5MP.

it creates that much high quality pictures with big resolution.

I was so impressed.

If you use tri-pod, you will get much sharper images.

So, we can easily infer C-5050 can bring better images with 5Mp than this C-750. 

However, I have a plan to buy a digital SLR camera someday around 1 year later. that's why I bought this camera instead of C5050. 

but I really can hear that C5050 says "how dare you!" whenever I take a picture with this cam. C750 is that much closed to C5050 for the quality, and has better functions such as 10X Optical Zoom (digital : 40X zoom), long run Movie Clip + Audio support, and so on for more fun!

 


Problems

Now, we can talk about some problems with this camera.

1. when you take a shot in a place that is little bit dark "without Flash", it will be very hard to catch a moment. you will see many blur objects.

with flash, of cause perfect.

it's about exposure. 

and it's common with all digital cameras.

2. when you take a picture with your hand, it will be so sensitive. so I recommend you to have a tri-pod.

3. short battery life. but you can use regular AA. so doesn't matter that much.

Or you can buy and use Lithium battery packs. it's 20-30 times longer than regular AA alcarline-batteries.

4. Thick. because of the lens. but if you love 10x zoom, you have to forgive them.

5. digital view finder.

I really hate this. but I had no choice.

I don't use this. I only use the LCD monitor.

6. still the lens cap problem. it has been a problem from C720. it's not tight. 

7. memory card. you only use xD memory cards.

C5050 uses xD, compact Flash, and smart media card all together at once. that's why I love it. but C750, we only use xD.



Even though all these problems,

this camera is really nice. actually more than great to me for some reasons.

1. really great colors.

I checked all brands' samples. this is the top.

2. really low noise level.

I checked all brands' samples. this is the top also.

3. 10X optical Zoom.

I compared with all brands, also it was the top for this feature.

4. resolution : 3200x2400 (max) / same as C5050

5. Super Macro : from 1". I tested it. it worked even shorter.

so, it's very simple to decide to choose a digi-cam.

If you want both of quality and fun -&gt; C750.

If you are hunting down only for the quality with mid-budget -&gt; C5050.

Very simple.

I highly recommend two of them.

C750 is $599.99 in B&H right now.

C5050 is $629.95 in B&H.
