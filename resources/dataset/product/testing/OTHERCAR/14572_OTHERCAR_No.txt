            Ok
I purchased this camera when it first came out and paid $600 for it.  I was so excited because I love using graphic programs and I wanted to do a lot of touching up etc.   I was so devastated when I was taking pictures :(  the quality was TERRIBLE, out of focus, blurry and the resolution was the worse I had ever seen.  It was great that you coul use a floppy disk and what was even greater is that it would hold between 20-30 pictures, unfortunately, they didn't look all that great.
You could get one high resolution BMP but thats it, ONLY ONE and still it was horrible quality.  It took a long time to process each picture too so that wasnt great either.

It has a type of mini movie option but it wasn't any good either, when you tried to take pictures from it, they were too dark.

I absolutely hate this product and would not recommend it to anyone.  BE WARNED!!
