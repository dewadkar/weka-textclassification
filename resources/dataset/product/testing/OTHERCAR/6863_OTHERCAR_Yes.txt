            If the first three weeks of owning a vehicle is indicative of the next couple of years, then this was a great decision.   This little car drives like a much larger one.  I enjoy driver smaller cars, but like the comfort of the larger ones.  This car gives you a bit of both.  The model that I purchased has quite a few little &quot;extras&quot; that make a small car seem much more deluxe.  It has a cd player, power sunroof, power windows, cruise control and dual airbags.  The driver's seat is quite comfortable with a lumbar support feature that makes longer drives  more bearable.  The price was quite reasonable, about the same as you would pay for a Saturn or a Corolla.  The biggest selling point for me was that the car felt sturdier and handled better than the others that I tested. The feature that it didn't have and that I would have liked, is the keyless entry. It is quite a bit of car for a nice price.<br><br>
