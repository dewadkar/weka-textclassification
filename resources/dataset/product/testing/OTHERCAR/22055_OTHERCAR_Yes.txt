            Some time back it became evident that I was no longer going to be able to have free access to the office (digital) camera anytime I wanted it.  I had made the mistake of showing co-workers how easy it was to take a picture on the digital camera. 

Having already discovered the joys of having a digital camera and having experienced how such a thing could help me in my eBay endeavors, I decided I needed one of my very own.  I began comparison shopping and reading product review boards online.

It was easy to narrow down the choices.  I liked the office camera, but wanted one which would show more detail in pictures and take better pictures indoors in less light.  I also did not want to spend a magnificent amount, lest the minute I brought it home newer technology emerge that was twice as good for half the cost.

I decided it would be best to get a camera that had software for both Mac and Windows computers.  This narrowed down the choices considerably. There were only a few of those to consider in the under $500 range.

It didn't take long reading product review boards to find that the Kodak DC215 was immensely popular.  I tried using &quot;lowest price online&quot; type search engines to find the best price.  I found some spectacular deals, but each time I found one, this camera was &quot;temporarily out of stock&quot;, &quot;out of stock&quot;, or &quot;on backorder&quot;.  Either it was hard to for retailers to get, or in high demand.  After deciding that this was the one to buy, I couldn't find it except at places where the price was very high.

I eventually located a good price, and it was in stock. I got a better buy than I had hoped for. Rather than get the Kodak DC215 in gold/silver color, I opted for the Kodak DC215 Zoom (Millenium).  It came with 8 mb memory, as well as a SanDisk (card reader).  It also came with some great software and not just &quot;camera&quot; software. We were happy to get Adobe  PageMill and some other programs in this package.  It comes with cables and all that is needed, more or less.  I don't need the cables - the SanDisk card reader is a great little contraption and makes it so easy and fast to put the pictures on the computer.

My beloved Kodak DC215 Zoom does a great job.  I actually took the time to read the manual and it was very clear about how to do everything, step by step by step. (Well, okay, I didn't read ALL the manual, but most of it, anyway.)  I followed the directions, and wow! it worked! First time!
No screwdrivers, special adapters, or valium needed.  

This is a great camera - perfect for my use and for my family's use.  The pictures are easy to take. I have never had a zoom feature on any previous camera, and I love it.  The pictures are so clear, very, very colorful and bright, and there is excellent detail. Combine this with a good printer and some Kodak printer paper and that's it. Made in the shade.

While it's not a camera for professionals, it's a good camera for the family. I don't see why we would need anything fancier or more expensive - the pictures are more than satisfactory.

Best of all, it comes in colors. We chose purple ice.  *Some* of us feel that's the most important feature. *G*<br><br>
