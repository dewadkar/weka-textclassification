            To avoid any confusion I would like to begin by stating that i'm no driver ladies and gents. My feet didn't touch the pedals of this car at any time during my "MOTHERS" test drive. This review is solemnly written in a passenger perspective. Let the helpfuls and somewhat helpfuls rain down on me, if that is what you wish. Just a little warning to all the gear-heads out there. And now, on with the review.

First Impressions/Exterior: Upon first laying eyes on it, It is hard to not give a double take to the Mini Coopers exterior charms. It swept my mom off her feet too. The minute you enter the somewhat small cabin it becomes apparent that this Cooper is no econo-box. The quality is impressive from the time you close the door, the shut very solid giving you that secure feeling of a luxury car.

Interior: My gripes are few when it comes to the cooper&#146s interior. The bucketed leather seats where comfortable and cuddled around my torso. While short lived, my time in the driver&#146s seat was enjoyed. All the control both climate and audio were easy to identify after a short time, while I wasn't exactly accustomed to the toggle switch like style. A warning to anyone taller than say....6ft. 4in.  this car wasn't build with you in mind. As its name states, the mini cooper is fairly tight in terms of head room and leg room. Even so, the Cooper should fit most people&#146s frames easily with little discomfort. Cup holders were generally in well thought-out places yet the two in the glove compartment ended up being a chore for my long knees. I must mention the addition of sun roofs to our mini cooper. I highly recommend that if you are to get one option, this it your best bet. The increase of light entering the cabin easily double once the sun roof is opened. And what could be better than one sun roof, how about two. Yes folk, with the sun roof package, you get a total of two sun roofs, one in the front, and one in the rear. The extra sunlight makes sitting in the back less of a drag as it used to be in say a Chevy Caviler 1996. On one final note, the interior plastics left something to be desired. The door panels inside are made of nearly all plastic which was an immediate turnoff for my both me and my mother.

Engine/Performance: The Coopers engine is a 1.6 liter transverse 4 cyl. with a max output of 115 bhp @ 5000 rpms. These entire figures translated into a top speed of 125 with a 0-60 time of 8.5 seconds. Not half bad for such a Mini car!

Ride/Handling: as if I need say this again, I DID NOT DRIVE THIS CAR. Even so I was able to obtain plenty of info on the Coopers ride and Handling through my mothers joy rides. In her opinion, the Coopers ride is "quick and snappy, it reminded me of my old Honda civic. The steering is very responsive. I really like this little car."
I think I can sum all that up to point and shoot handling, almost go-kart-like. The ride isn't perfect per se. There are times in rough terrain and driving up hill that the ride can become a bit choppy. Thankfully, the Coopers ride high is fairly higher than most cars in its class so living in rural areas isn&#146t too big a hassle.

Ergonomics: This was more than likely a large part in the choice of the Mini Cooper for my mother. Being a full time commuter, good ergonomics is a must for my mother. The mini cooper proves to impress with 24 city mpg and 33 highway mpg. The Cooper has a fuel tank capacity of 13.2 Gallons. This translates into 317 total city miles and 436 highway miles. 

Options: I added this section to my review to help you understand the price and benefits of the options we got on our model. We started with the base model as apposed to the Turbocharged Cooper S. We also include profile leather upholstery at $1250 which comes as no surprise. We also requested the sun roof package which I stated before. This included two electrically controlled roofs with mesh tinting. This package came at a small price of $800. Finally, we through in the sport seat package at my request (although it cost me) at an easy $270.

For only $19,295 the Cooper has much to be proud of. Its got looks, comfort, and performance to boot.

While it may not be my car exactly, the cooper is one of the best choice in autos my family has made to date.
