            I live in Easter Europe - Lithuania. We a have a very cold winter, lot's of rainy summer days, muddy autumns and springs. If You live in the country with such conditions, I think You should consider buying a hyundai!
I bought Sonata last year in the autumn. I liked the price (better car for less money), the design (though not every one likes it front end design) and the luxury. I never thought about bad road conditions when it starts to rain and to snow, but when it did I had the best car for that.
Due to good suspension and traction control the car has a perfect handling when braking on muddy surface and making sudden maneuvres. You always know how it will behave on ice or snow and ride it very much like an expencive luxury car. Maybe the suspension could be a little stiffer and higher. At night the lights are very effective and anti-gof lights are somewhat almost perfect. 
HIVEC(Hyundai Integrated Vehicle Electronic Control) Auto Transmission 
is very clever when you get on slippery part of road. Auto transmission doesn't have a winter option - it should detect winter conditions automatically. And it really does. 
I also never had problems of something freezed in it or to it. Doors, windows work perfect even in -20C.

The winter is comming and I know that it'll be easy for me with my Sonata! <br><br>
