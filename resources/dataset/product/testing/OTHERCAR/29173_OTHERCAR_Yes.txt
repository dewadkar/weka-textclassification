            I recently purchased the Outback LL bean 3 liter model. The interior features are fantastic, from electric seat adjustments, lumbar controls, to seat warmers. The radio had a built in antenna, CD changer. The car runs great and has excellent acceleration. In addition it has great gas mileage for the size of its engine I usually get between 20-23 mpg. My major recommendation would be to make sure you get your tires rotated every 5000 miles, I failed to do this and had tire wear and needed realignment. One of my favorite parts about owning this Subaru is the all wheel drive. We have a young child and so are very careful when driving in bad weather. This car will drive through a terrible rain storm and we don't even feel it, the tires really grip to the road for a very safe feeling. Haven't taken it up to the snow yet but plan to soon. the trunk of this car is very spacious being a wagon. There is a lovely cover to pull over for privacy, and cargo net which I use all the time when grocery shopping. The middle seat in the rear also has a shoulder seat belt. This means that three passengers can be buckled up safely in the back seat. overall I feel this wagon is an excellent family car. I do recommend leather interior for the simple reason of avoiding stains. The car is comfortable for long trips, rides smooth and has plenty of headroom. It took me only a test drive to sell me that this was a great family vehicle that will last for many years.
