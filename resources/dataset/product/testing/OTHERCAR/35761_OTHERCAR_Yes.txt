            This is the third Honda Accord I have owned. My previous model years were a 1986 LX-i (136,000 miles), 1995 EX (still own it at 100,000 miles) and now this 2003 LX.

The interior of the 2003 is the first thing I noticed was finally changed. It has a much sleeker design and more simplified. The radio is mainly controlled by a master dial. This dial controls the power and volume. A CD player comes standard in the LX model. There are now smaller dials that control the temperature and fan speed. The radio display is larger than previous years and much easier to read.

Steering: An adjustable/Telescoping steering wheel comes standard. The telescoping is a big addition for shorter people that may have troubles with the seat/steering wheel placement. The rack and pinion steering is much tighter and allows for tighter and smoother turns.

Power Interior: Power windows come standard with auto up and down for the driver. Power mirrors are also a standard feature although the knob to adjust the mirrors seems a bit flimsy. The power locks is also part of the LX package with keyless entry. The keyless entry is built into the key itself and is not a separate piece (much more convenient). The windows can also be controlled by the outside. Once you stick the key in the door, you turn and hold the key and all of the windows go either up or down, depending on their position. Cruise control is a well received feature in the LX model.

Exterior Design: At first glance, the changes will strike you: Its exterior is sleek, aggressive and well designed. The headlamps are more rounded. The trunk is a bit higher and the nose drops down a bit farther. The design somewhat resembles the new Nissan Altimas, but not as squared off in the trunk area.

Ride: Extremely quite, tight and smooth. The ride resembled a Passat but much less in price. Overall a very European ride.

Fuel: Regular Unleaded! There is no need for Premium. So far the gas mileage has lived up to what the sticker claims. I am averaging 26 MPG city.

Safety: The LX comes standard with Driver and passenger airbags. You can add the optional side impact airbags. On the rear deck are child safety seat hooks, no need to make your own. ABS front disc brakes are standard with drum brakes in the rear. You have the option of getting rear ABS disc brakes as well. The trunk, besides having the rear seat fold down, has a safety release switch inside.

For the ultimate combination of performance and value, the Accord LX Sedan should be at the top of everyone's list. Standard features are a remote entry system with power window controls, air conditioning, power windows, cruise control, mirrors and door locks, and an AM/FM/CD audio system. Also available are side airbags. 

I am very happy with this car. You get a lot of car for the money. For those considering an Altima, I think you will find the Honda to be more solid. The Nissans tend to sound tinny.
