            I recently did a 24 hour test drive with a 2003 and I wish I hadn't... now I want one and the vehicles in my price range just don't measure up!

I'm not a auto expert like some of the other reviewers so I'll just give you my opinion as a 40 year old woman, 5'7" who currently drives a 2001 Pontiac Sunfire.

I immediately fell in love with the look of it.  Trendy, hip, cool lines.  When I opened the door, I think that's when the lust began...  

You sit up very high but not like you're driving a huge pickup.  It's a comfortable, good view of the road seating height.  It's a comfortable manageable size, I didn't get that "bus driver" feeling that I've had in larger SUV's. I tried several less expensive SUV type vehicles and they didn't compare to the seating (Aztek, Tracker, Vibe).  The leather seats were very comfortable and adjusted in a bunch of different positions.  If you can't find a comfortable position in these seats, then you need to see a doctor  :-)  The radio and CD controls were all on the steering wheel and very easy to manipulate, it even has a mute button - handy for when someone is talking on the phone or you go through a drive-thru! There were plug ins in the front and rear, which was great.  Climate controls for both sides was an added bonus - I'm always cold, my husband is always hot but we were both "just right" for this trip.   Storage was great!!!  There were storage elements for everyone and everything.  My favorite was that I could store my purse under the center console - ladies know all about the problems that purse storage can bring!  Everyone in the back seat had plenty of room as well.  We had the 3rd seat down and there was more than enough storage for anything I've ever lugged home.  If you moved the second seats around you could probably handle most furniture!

It drove and handled like a dream.  It was very easy to park and was manageable to manuever around parking lots and small side streets.  It wasn't quite as powerful on the hills as I would have thought but it had all the power you would need in average road conditions.  A very quiet ride and it didn't feel like a wind tunnel when you opened any of the windows.  I did think the gas mileage could have been better, the sticker said 18/24 but I think it was much less than that on the in town mileage.

Overall, I thought this was a great vehicle.  $32,000 is a little out of my price range but if I ever make better money, this is the type of vehicle I want!  If you get one - lucky you!!!
