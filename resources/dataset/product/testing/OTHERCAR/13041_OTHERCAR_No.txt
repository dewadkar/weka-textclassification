            This car sucks.

We purchased it used from a dealership after falling in love with its sleek design and contemporary features. Unfortunately, the sleek design soon faded after the hubcaps turned from pearly silver to a rusted matte brown, and the cherry red paint on the car started chipping. 

The contemporary features did nothing for the car since they never worked.  I especially enjoyed the nifty little cruise control that invariably came on at 35MPH........ and refused to turn off (yes, that WAS me on the highway, not grandma). Even the cupholders and cigarette-lighter became feisty and refused to work within one month of owning the car. 

The car was equipped with steering wheel radio controls. Allegedly, one could use their fingers to press a button on the steering wheel to control the radio.  That would have been nice, if it had worked for me.  Turning the volume UP would turn the radio OFF, turning the radio OFF would do absolutely nothing... and the list continues.

The car was also equipped with HUD (Heads-Up-Display) that displayed the car's speed on the windshield.  We never used it since the dim/bright feature for the digital display stopped being functional. Kinda blinding at night, ya know.

I can at least say that the car was reliable: it reliably stalled in second gear when making a right hand curve going 20MPH or less; it reliably locked me IN the car in freezing temperatures; and it reliably refused to start in colder temperatures.

When we finally gave the car up for adoption, the undercarriage was literally held together with duct tape, twist-ties and plastic handcuffs.  

Ultimately, I learned to NEVER buy a Pontiac again.  Now, where's the review site for the danged dealership? I have a few choice words for them.....<br><br>
