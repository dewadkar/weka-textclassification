            I recently purchased my 2nd Maxima (I also own a '95 SE which I gave to my wife), and I couldn't be happier. The car is unbelievable. I gave in to the enthusiast side of me, and went with the 5-speed. It is just awesome. With the 5-speed though, there are definitely some adjustments to make. First off, the engine is almost too quiet for it's own good. The clutch gives virtually no engine feedback to the driver, so it's almost impossible to tell how many RPM's the engine's at without looking at the tach, or turning down the radio and listening. Not overly annoying, but certainly something to get used to. Second, is that the warm idle speed is set too low (650RPM) for the manual tranny. It's very easy to stall at a traffic light or on a hill if you don't give it enough gas. The dealer told me that the idle speed can't be adjusted (there appears to be loc-tite on the idle adjustment screw). Again, no biggie, just something to get used to.

But the positives FAR outweigh the minor issues I have. The car just wants to go. The 5-speed definitely gets more out of this engine than the automatic does. The true thrust is above 3500RPM. It just seems effortless for the car at this part of the power band, it's that refined. 

Handling is also noticeably better on my 2k SE. I opted for the 17&quot; wheel package, and am thinking of ordering a Stillen FSTB. Road feel is incredible, though it might seem harsh for some. For those people I suggest opting for the GLE. 

Inside, other than a lack of wood trim, I'd swear it was an Infiniti or Lexus. The leather is very nice. Everything is laid out sensibly, as my other one is. I opted for the Bose Stereo package. I got it at invoice ($600), and I've heard just about as many arguments for the Bose as against. With the additional powered sub on the rear deck, it is a big step up from the Premium system. For $600, you can probably build an add-on system that would rival the Bose, but not much better. My advice would be to save yourself the hassle of purchasing and installing additional stereo stuff and go with the Bose.

Exterior-wise, I really like the new design. Like the 4th-gen Maxima, it's love it or hate it, but at least it's different. Unlike Camry and Accord, which hasn't changed in 10 years it seems. I like the fact that it stands out from the crowd. And I like the smoked taillights of the SE. And of course, the rear spoiler makes the look of the whole car. I think the last 2 generations of Maximas were designed to have the spoiler on them. The ones that don't have them look like there's something missing from the car.

Overall, it's a great car. I went with the Sherwood Green. I also think the Grey Lustre looks great too. Black works too, if you like to torture yourself keeping it clean (My '95 is Black - never again). I'd also like to recommend Zaino Bros polish. It is simply the best stuff out there. You can only get it online at www.zainobros.com. Check it out. <br><br>
