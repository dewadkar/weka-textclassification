            First of all, I agree with most of the opinions already written.  The MC3 does not take the GREATEST pictures nor is it a very good video camera (as a matter of fact, it is in no way a substitute for a video cameras), and it is a middle of the road mp3 player.  HOWEVER, the fact that this cool little device does all three of these functions makes up for the lack of perfect performance.

First the pictures...
  I have tried taking pictures inside and outside with the mc3 and it is difficult to take high quality pictures with no zoom or auto-focus.  However, I knew this before I bought the product and so should you.  You are limited with the features and I just work around it.  I step closer to my pictures and I limit them to the day time.  Once they are on the computer, they are great to email to friends or morph and play with.

Next the video...
  At the high quality video setting, I was quite surprised at the smooth video play.  Sure I can't video my sister's soccer game with the mc3, but it is perfect to pass around to the kids after a game to say hi or do a cheer.  It is great for creating little messages that should be sent through email.  The high quality setting does suck that memory, but if you use it for a couple of little clips, you can then save them on your computer and free up the space on the flash memory.

Finally the music...
  If there is one feature that performs more like similar products on the market, it is the mp3 player.  The screen has an equalizer and allows for adjusting the sound quality.  The song quality is great with the ear phones however the quality drops when played through the mono speaker... but then again, how often do you want to listen to music through a little speaker.  It was made to be a portable player, not a boom box.

Overall, if you realize the limitations to this product and are ok with them, you will love this product.  One ideal usage for it would be a day at a theme park.  Think of it, you save a disk full of music.  Throughout the day you listen to your music while you wait in line.  You can also take funny pictures with your friends and even get a video clip of you going down that big hill on the roller coaster.  Then, you can put them all into a slide show on the computer and watch a multimedia review of your day.  I have had a lot of fun with the mc3 and for the price of a good mp3 player, I got the digital pictures and videos as a bonus basically.  If you want a fun toy for summer and beyond, this is it.  However if you want a quality digital camera, go elsewhere.
