            I bought this car because well, the old one was paid off and I had the money and decided it was about time. I looked at a ton of different makes and models and almost wound up with a used Corvette instead. In the end though, I really felt comfortable in the Sebring, and have never regretted the decision.

Its engine runs smooth and quiet, it has power and speed. I really like the steering control, it stays stable at high speeds and has just the right amount of resistance to keep you from overcorrecting or not being able to turn sharply. I honestly think that that is something overlooked in most cars today; The amount of play and control in the wheel.

It's also - and here's the part that grabbed my real attention, economical and safe. It's definitely one of the safest cars on the road, despite that it's a convertible.

I think that this year's line of Chryslers in general, and specifically the Sebring, have placed Chrysler back on the good boy list of car manufacturers. I have heard good things about most of their cars this year, and can say first hand that the Sebring has certainly impressed me.<br><br>
