            I must say that I have preferred General Motors' vehicles all my life, and the six months that I spent with my 1999 GMC Sonoma only confirmed that.  In June 1999 I purchased the truck simply because it was the cheapest new vehicle on the lot, or in the city for that matter.  It was the most basic model, the SL, with no options at all - 2-door, 4-cylinder 2.2Liter, 5-speed manual transmission.  The truck had a firm yet smooth ride quality, and was surprisingly quick and agile in city driving, having acceleration equal to a friend's 4.0 Liter Ford Ranger.  However, the traction was greatly reduced in the rain or snow.

     Over the 6 months that I owned that truck, it went through more punishment than any vehicle should be required to take.  The fuel economy was good under hard driving conditions, yet the vehicle was fun to drive and could off road with the big boys.  In December of '99, hazardous Wisconsin weather and a patch of glare ice caused me to slide the truck sideways, drivers-door-first, into a concrete light pole.  The pole broke apart, and the truck was pretty much totaled, but I walked away without a scratch on me.  Even with the driver's side door in the frame, the truck started and ran well.  I would reccomend the GMC Sonoma to anyone looking for a reliable, well built truck on a small budget.<br><br>
