            When you read these camera reviews, make sure you properly compare any one model with digicams in general.

All digicams take a few seconds to start up (anywhere from 3,4 seconds to 10 seconds or so.) This model takes about 5 seconds (www.imaging-resource.com measures all cameras for this.)

All digicams have a delay from when you push the shutter button to when the picture is taken. The delay in this camera is average to better-than-average, especially if you pre-focus first (just like a SLR.)

Many digicams have relatively 'slow' lenses with maximum apertures of f3 and above especially when zoomed. The Casio QV-2000 has a pretty fast lens, which means that your shots will be less blurry in moderate to poor lighting conditions w/o flash (I hate using flash so this is important to me.) The Canon lens in this unit has been very favorably reviewed by most major digicam web sites.

Color is very good as well, and manual white balance means you can adjust for lighting conditions (if you don't know what white balance is then leave it on auto- the Casio does a pretty good job at adjusting this.) This camera is very easy to use for an first-timer, but has a lot of manual settings if you are more experienced (aperture and shutter priority modes, etc.)

5 x 7 prints on my HP inkjet are excellent, and even 8 x 10's are much better than I expected.

All digicams take extra time to store images to card after a picture is taken. The Casio has an excellent buffer that allows pretty fast shooting in 'continuous' mode (just set it on continuous permanently as there is no penalty for doing so.)

All digicams devour power. Some (like the Canon models) come with proprietary rechargeable batteries. This is a nice feature, but if you want to buy a spare pack it will cost you. OTOH, the Casio uses AA sized batteries, and NiMH rechargeables can be had for very cheap. Around $25 for a charger and 4 batteries, another 10 dollars for another set of batteries.

I don't know the exact power consumption of this camera, but I can shoot all day with my 128 MB memory card and still not have ran down a set of batteries.

Others have mentioned reliability problems, I can only say that my camera has functioned perfectly since day 1. The body is plastic but has been very solid (I only knock it down 1 on durability because there are some protruding parts that could be knocked off if you're really rough on it.)

In summary, this is an excellent camera if you can still find it on EBay or closeout somewhere.
