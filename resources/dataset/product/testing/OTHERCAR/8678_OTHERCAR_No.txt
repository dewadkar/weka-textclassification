            I have owned and driven Mercedes cars for over 20 years because of the consistent and excellent fit and finish Mercedes has always offered - until now.  My 2001 ML320 at 5000 miles on the clock has already suffered failures on the power windows, ABS system and auto-lock system.  The front and rear plastic "bumpers" look like they are ready to fall off at any moment.  Mercedes Service tells me  "That's the way they all fit."  The rear door has a poor fit and rattles excessively on all but the smoothest road surfaces.  The ride is excellent but the details of my ML320 is just not up to (what used to be)Mercedes standards.
