            My 1999 Toyota Camry is a car for the open road. I rack up serious highway miles every week, and that's why I bought the Camry. With the solid Toyota engineering and construction, I wouldn't be surprised to repeat the 325,000 miles I put on my old Corolla in 10 years. (We sold it to a friend who still drives it.)

But it's not just the Toyota quality that makes the Camry a highway car. At highway speed, it sails over bumps or rough road with just a sound or two - you really don't feel it. But on local roads at slower speeds, every pavement crack reverberates with the car rumbling like a drum.

As for handling, on any road the car leans on curves, rocks side-to-side on rutted asphalt, and noses down when braking. In other words, it hugs the road; good if you like that.

Power is great even with the 4-cylinder engine. Just switch off the overdrive either to merge onto the highway, or to accelerate fast when you're already at cruising speed. (I wonder how many people ever do this?)
This way the engine keeps revving because otherwise it tries to downshift ASAP. I can easily pass other traffic going uphill. 

Handling is fairly loose - more typical of the older American cars than what most imports have offered in recent years.

Perhaps the tight suspension is what makes the car handle so well even with four adults on board.

The ABS brakes take some getting used to.  They kick in whenever I brake hard, or even when braking steadily from 30 or 40 mph to stop or turn into a driveway. 

Interior noise level is so quiet, when idling it's easy to forget the car is running, and people speaking outside can hardly be heard thru the window glass. Even at highway speed, the engine is barely audible.

I have no doubt this Camry will be around for a lot of miles.<br><br>
