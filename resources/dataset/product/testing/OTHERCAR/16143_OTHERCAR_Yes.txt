            I'm in love with my Jeep Grand Cherokee!  I've never driven anything quite like it before.  I used to have a BMW, I believe a 97 just normal Beemer, when I decided in November of last year it was time for a good old change.  I went to a lot of local Dealerships and not only was Jeep the best priced but the salespeople were making my experience only better.

With many great features like CD, Cassette, FM/AM radio with 10 different set stations, Air Conditioning, Cruise Control, Leather interior, great color selection, lots of cargo space, and soon to be add-ons for my Jeep, this was a no brainer.  Jeep Grand Cherokee is the car for everyone!

I would recommend the Jeep Grand Cherokee to anyone that wants a Larger Motor Vehicle, but doesn't want to spend their life savings on Gas (much like what is necessary when purchasing a Navigator or Expedition).  This is the car for anyone!!!
