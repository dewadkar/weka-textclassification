                 This is the best product that Acura has ever put out.  I've had three Acura's (Legend '90, Legend '93, &amp; TL '00), and they've all been wonderful.  However, this car outperforms all of them.  After test-driving all cars in the &quot;near-luxury&quot; segment, this car came out the hands down winner.  It has a great blend of performance and luxury at a relatively cheap price.  

     Before buying this car, we looked the Maxima, I30, ES300, Audi A4 and BMW 328.  It has more luxury features than the Maxima.  It handles better and feels more solid than the I30.  It was cheaper than a comparably equipped ES300, and it has much more room than the 328 and A4.

     Performance is definitely this car's strong point.  It has incredible acceleration with it's 225 hp engine.  It handles curves extremely well.  I drive in the hills of Pittsburgh, and this car gives the driver complete control.  It also has front-wheel drive, which performs wonderfully in the snow.

     This car offers people an assortment of standard luxury items that are mindboggling given the price.  Xenon lamps, Bose Stereo w/ in-dash CD-Tape decks, Traction control, Heated Seats, Home-link transmitter, and sunroof rank up at the top of the list.  I was surprised that they were giving all this under $30K.

     While the luxury items in this car are plenty, you can see where Acura has cut corners.  The leather is nice, but definitely a grade below the Audi's, Benz's, and BMW's out there.  The wood trim is not quite as bad as the trim commonly found in American sedans, but it won't be mistaken for the cars mentioned above.  There's no memory seats either (which should be present in this class.)   However, when it's all said and done, these are nitpicky details that are easily overlooked.  It's important to keep in mind that you will be paying significantly less than the any comparably equiped near-luxury sedan also.

     Some might find the exterior and interior styling of this sedan to be a bland.  I find the interior to be cozy and simple.  Everything is right where you expect and would want it to be.  There really aren't many bells &amp; whistles, but it all makes sense.  I happen to like the exterior styling, but will be the first to admit that it's not going to start a revolution.

     In the end, this is the perfect car out there for anyone that wants a powerful and luxurious sedan.  It sits four comfortably, and space for five is adequate.  The trunk is large enough to please most people.  An added bonus is that it has more prestige and &quot;cool appeal&quot; than your Accord, Camry, and Maxima.  You also get standard Acura/Honda quality.  Most importantly, it's a fun car to drive.  Definitely the best value Acura has to offer.<br><br>
