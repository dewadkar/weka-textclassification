            i take a lot of pictures. but i hate the idea of developing. so i have rolls and rolls of undeveloped film in my room. i guess on one of those rainy days i will go develop the film. when the idea of digital cameras came out i immediately jumped on the band wagon. just think you can &quot;develop&quot; your pictures with out paying the developing charges. 
my old digital camera was a canon a5. it was tiny and very precise. but i wanted a professional camera so i purchased the kodak dc280. it was advertised as a professional camera. the kodak took magnificent pictures but the pictures i wanted to take, the up close with the portrait feature 8 inches to 1.6 inches, did not come out. everything came out blurry. i tried and tried. it would not come out. i even called kodak customer service. i was on hold the first time for about 15 minutes, that was at 10 am. then i tried again at 3 pm forget about it. i was on hold for 30 minutes and did not get through. i returned it after the first day. 

the battery life: it takes 4 aa batteries. this camera sucks akaline. the four kodak photo life batteries lasted about 2 hours. they were terrible. the ac adaptor is optional so you have to buy it. i recommend it.

picture capacity: 245 on standard and 32 on high resolution

usb connection: very fast. use it up to 10x faster than serial port

picture quality: beautiful. if you take regular pics. it works well. but up close (for what i need) terrible.

easy to use
two mega pixel resolution
