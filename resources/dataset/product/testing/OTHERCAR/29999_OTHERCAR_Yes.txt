            In an attempt to lure more young buyers to their mark, M-B offers the 2002 C 230 Coupe.  Starting at just under $26k, the new MB can be found on the lots at stickers well under $29k.  I took a quick test drive as soon as one hit the showroom. 

The C coupe looks pretty nice from the front, stylish and aggressive.  The double oval headlights and the grill look similar to the higher priced C sedans, but a closer look shows the sporty coupe has a more aggresive rake.  The lineage to the CLK is noticeable in the side view, and the tall tail end accentuates its sporty intention.  The tall tail is combined with a smaller wheel arch that looks odd in photos, but this isn't as noticeable in person.  The tail end treatment is easier on the eyes if you look at it from an angle instead of straight on.  

I drove the six speed manual, which has short, positive throws that seem a little notchy.  The feel is pretty similar to Audi's manual, and better than Nissan, though not as good as Honda or BMW.  The C Coupe acclerates effortlessly, but without much rush.  
Handling is what you might expect of a rear wheel driven German car, with a somewhat heavy feel from the steering wheel but good feedback from the road.  The car also rides pretty well over bumpy roads, and highway cruising at 75mph is quiet for a 4 banger.  
The overall feel of the car is refined and civilized, perhaps too tame for the ricer X crowd.

I was really impressed with the interior, it feels well made and the atmosphere feels luxurious without a single piece of wood paneling.  I'd be much happier if the large speedo was a tachometer; instead, the tacho is squeezed to the left, and shaped so that it fits within the half oval window portion of the steering wheel.  

No time to judge the sound system on this ride, although the controls look complex, and the faceplate has to be flipped up to insert tapes.  CD is a $6~700 option, and only the M-B unit is supposed to work with the preinstalled optical link.

The hatchback configuration will be useful, and with the seats down, cargo space becomes pretty impressive.  Even with the seats up, cargo space equals that of a 3 series. The back seat is a little hard to get into for taller occupants, but once inside it's fairly roomy and comfortable.   

The M-B lists from $25k up.  The base configuration includes Brake Assist, 6 Air bags and two side curtains,
dual zone climate control, 16 inch alloy wheels, a sport suspension package, Electronic Stability Program and solid M-B feel.  It does not include power seats, moonroof, CD or leather.  (Please check M-B's website for more details).  To some, that might sound like too much for too little.  After driving the car, it sounded too good to be true.

The C coupe will be a logical alternative for anyone looking for a sporty car that can carry four people in style.  For just a little more than a fully optioned Celica or RSX, you can impress friends and neighbors with the Tri-Star badge.  You can also walk into your M-B dealer for service and enjoy the same lounge used by the S-Class owners.  (But be prepared for the high service charge.) And best of all, it's a solid car that's not only sporty, but safe. 

I came away impressed by the new C Coupe, and considering the price, it is pretty high on my shopping list.  Updates will follow.
