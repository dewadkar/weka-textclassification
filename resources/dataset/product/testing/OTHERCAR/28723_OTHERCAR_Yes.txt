            I have gone through several lower resolution cameras and have come to realize that you get what you pay for.  This camera ran me $179 and it has been well worth the price.  At 2 megapixels, it offers great resolution unless you require some serious size.  One thing that is annoying is that the default resolution is too high.  If you open the camera a snap a quick picture, it will be at 1600x1200.  This is really too large for most monitors and the files are somewhat large.  Not to mention that you will only be able to save 16 pictures on the standard 8mb card that is included.  A more reasonable resolution would be 1024x768 or even 800x600 and would give you space for dozens of pictures.  You can always change the resolution before you take the picture, but that eliminates the advantage of the camera's almost immediate readiness.  Overall, this is a minor issue.  Pictures are crisp and clear.  An advantage for me is the macro setting which lets you get as close a 9"-12" from the subject for close ups (ideal for small items).  The colors are very accurate and the flash usually adds the correct amount of light.  The movie setting is quite nice and let's you capture about 20 seconds of near real time movement.  The software included loaded like a breeze, which had been a big problem on the lower end cameras.  It has some very slick features including the best panoramic setting I have seen. It "stitches" together individual pictures into a long picture and does a great job overlapping them without the common blur or lines showing up.  The USB connection is very fast in downloading the pictures and never takes more than a few seconds for a completely filled card.  The built in screen is easy to read and clear.  The on-screen controls are a little difficult to get used to even though they are advertised as very simple.  A few pictures and you should get the hang of it though.  So far the batteries have held up well and I still have a full charge after at least 100 pictures and several short movies.  I would recommend this camera highly, but would suggest a larger smartcard if you plan on taking more than 16 large pictures at a time.  All-in-all I am extremely satisfied!
