            For a long time I loved the ability to scan pictures and edit them or use them in digital documents.  From adding myself to family events I wasn't actually at to supporting my graphics art and web page design efforts.  The main problem was film, having to scan the pictures, did the shot come out right, etc.  Well the digital cameras are finally at a point to pretty much do away with my film based cameras.  This camera has the has so many features packed into a small, easy to carry case.  

First off the main thing I was looking for was picture quality.  This camera take great pictures.  The color and clarity of the pictures are excellent.  Secondly I was looking for portability.  The camera is extremelly light weight and can even fit your pants pockets (for the most part).

The next most important feature to me was the optical zoom.  I currently use a Sony DSC-F55 which is a great camera but it lacks an optical zoom.  I used it at a friends wedding and really could have used a zoom.  It does have a digital zoom but that simply reduces resolution.  You can achieve the same thing with a photo editor.  The DSC-F505V however has a 5X optical zoom and a 10X digital zoom.  The digital zoom has definetly improved over the F55.  No real comparison.  The zoom is a must for those events like school plays or sporting events.  I looked at a couple of other CyberShots that have a 3X optical and the 5X optical is as low as I wanted to go.  I could still use a larger optical zoom but this will work great in most cases.  Sony does make a 2X add on lens which I will probably purchase a ways down the road.

Another nice feature is the USB interface.  Explorer treats the camera as a removable drive allowing you to open the picture in a photo editor directly from the Memory Stick or easily copy to a folder on your hard drive.  Makes picture management extremely simple.  The Memory Stick is a great media especially with the other equipment that sony is developing to use it.  The 8MB Stick that comes with it is almost worthless if you plan to take high-res pictures (4 pics per stick). Luckily there is a 64Mb stick that I will be purchasing before I go on vacation.

I have read through the manual (which could go into a little more detail on some of the features) and have a good idea about all of the features but haven't had a chance to test all of them out. 

The ability to switch between manual and auto focus is nice when zoomed all the way in or when shooting in low light situations.  The white balance is easy to use and makes a big difference in overall picture quality.

My wife is plagued by red eye disease which is greatly reduce by the anti-red eye setting.  The twilight and twilight+ features keep people from looking washed out in flash pictures.  The aperture priority mode and shutter speed priority mode give you a good deal of control over you environment.  Also the landscape mode and panfocus mode assist in those situations where the focal distance varies greatly.

The movie mode is great for sending video greetings etc via email. Last Christmas we used this feature on the DSC-F55 to email all of our friends and family a merry Christmas greeting.  I can't wait to do it this year because Sony improved the video capture capabilities over that of the F55.  

There are several other modes that are useful as well.  The email mode makes it easy to take high res pictures and send them via email with no conversion.  It actually takes a high-res picture and a low-res email size picture at the same time.  Again the USB makes this nice and easy because I can attach the low-res picture to the email directly from the camera without downloading it to the hard drive first.  This really cam in handy when a friend asked me to take some pictures of his new house so he could share them with his family via email.

I haven't used the uncompressed TIFF mode, Text Mode (not sure if I ever will) and voice mode.  Voice mode looks neat.  It records a high-res picture and up to 40 seconds of comments in an mpg format with a low-res version of the still picture.  I imagine I will use this on my upcoming vacation.<br><br>
