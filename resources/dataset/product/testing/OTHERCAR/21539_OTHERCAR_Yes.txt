            This camera was given to me as a gift after graduation from high school (because I broke my first one - an Olympus D460). I began to use it profusely, taking pictures of everything - from people to places, shooting mini video clips of random acts of the unordinary. I spent the first three months with it in China, taking probably over a thousand pictures with it. I didn't feel uncomfortable with whipping out my camera because it was simple as turning it on (2 seconds), focusing (1 second), and clicking (snap), and turning it off (1/2 second). Painless. simple. easy. No fuss with sliding open the camera, no waiting for anything to load.

I brought it with me up to the mountains and also into the nightclubs. The many options that the S200 has (lighting, environment adjustments, and special effects) made it possible to make scenes anywhere look fantastic. My favorite trick was to adjust the lighting exposure up, holding the camera still, and taking unbelievably beautiful shots of the skyline in Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjing. They turned out to look like those pictures you see on those panoramic posters of city skylines at night. 

While the S200 was great as a scenery and object camera, I put it to the test as a "social" camera in college. The size of it made it convenient for me to just simply slide it in my pocket so that I always had my hands open to hug my friends and meet new people. Whenever there was a moment that EVERYONE wish they had their camera, I ususally had mine right there with me. I've caught my friends drenched in mud, being chaotic out on an icerink, singing a surprise happy birthday song (video), and carting each other down our dorm hallway really fast in a supermarket shopping cart (video...and, what can i say? freshmen year hehe) In addition, I really like the digital telezoom for those moments where I like to play paparazzi.  Another good thing about this specific camera is the aesthetic design. It is such a people magnet (which can be very helpful at times). They go Oooh and Ahh, and I'm not too worried about handing it over to them for a quick look because the casing and build is so durable - that even if they did drop it (a small height on carpet) it wouldn't fatally explode into pieces.

Lastly, some technical analysis. The picture quality of the S200 is comparable to those of other cameras that have even higher resolution. Yes, the images are extremely sharp and the colors are marvelously rich. I bought a 128 mb memory card (I definitely recommend this) so that I would never run out of pictures in a middle of an exotic vacation or massive party. In daylight, it can take hundreds of shots. With flash, I'd imagine around 60-100 (which is enough to capture all my friends in their... silliness). It easily connects to the computer with a USB port and I believe with windows XP, you can directly copy the pictures from the camera (it will detect it automatically) to your folder. The locking option inside the camera is a little tedious. Works in both automatic and manual mode. The quickviewing screen is sharp and FAST. I don't have to wait for images to load up when I want to review them again. 

I am super excited for my next semester and the trips that I'll be taking next year (San Diego, Bahamas, Thailand). Once you buy this camera, especially if you're a photo-maniac like I am, you'll want to carry it anywhere and everywhere.
