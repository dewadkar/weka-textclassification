            I work in the line of wholesale jewelry.

We sell to jewelry stores across the United States and a few other countries around the world.

I have met a great number of these stores when I travel to conventions. At these shows there are always lots on new pieces of jewelry and lots of bargains that these stores don't get year round. So in between shows, I would fax and mail pictures of &quot;specials&quot; to keep our business up.Well, the faxed pictures weren't very clear and mailing pictures took way too long for some of the stores to receive.

Then, one day, I was talking to a customer and he told me about this
SONY MVC-FD73 DIGITAL STILL CAMERA.  He told me how wonderful this camera was for e-mailing pictures.

Well, We bought this camera last year on line at Worldwide Direct.
(www.BUYDIG.COM) They had the lowest price of $438.00 plus $29.95 shipping &amp; handling.

For this $467.95 I got:
*SONY MVC-FD73 DIGITAL STILL CAMERA
*Battery charger
*NP-F330 Lithium ion battery pack

*Power Cord
*Lens Cap
*And a Shoulder Strap

Great Features of This Camera:

Our SONY MVC-FD73 is and excellent camera all the way around. It is very easy to use-some one is always coming into my office to use it! All of the pictures we take- photo's of people and places or even fine and intricate detailed pieces of jewelry-All come out very crisp and clear.  It's also very easy to send them out over the internet and what I especially like, is that I get a quick response!  This camera is very lightweight and also travels easily.

I'm sure any household or business would be more then satisfied with this camera!

I Highly Recommend this SONY MVC-FD73 DIGITAL STILL CAMERA!!
