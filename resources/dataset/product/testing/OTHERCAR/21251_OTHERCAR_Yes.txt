            Toyota has once again continued its dominance with the Camry.  The Camry has always been a great car, and still is.  Packed with loads of features, this car has shown consumers that tradition continues.  A very comfortable car as usual; spacious for the driver and the passenger.  Trunk has plenty of space for consumers and the ride is very quiet.  Passengers can hardly notice that the engine's on when the car is still.  The handling is superb for a passenger car, while the safety features allow the driver and passengers to ride with confidence.  If your family is planning to purchase a dependable passenger car, the Camry would be the one to buy.<br><br>
