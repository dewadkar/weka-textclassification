            I bought this car because I needed a vehicle I could drive the wheels off of.  I owned a sports car that was killing me with maintenance costs and I wanted to park it.  Once I bought the Kia Sephia LS, I parked my sports car but didn't have to trade it in, because the Kia was so affordable.

The Kia is synonomous with other small cars.  I looked at Saturns, Mazdas, and Hondas.  They were all too expensive.  If one is looking at the 18k price range, they ought to buy a Ford Taurus.  Much more car for the money.  However, if you want a new car for 13k or lower, the Kia Sephia is alone.

First, the Kia does not feel like an econo job.  The interior of the LS model is way above the comfort level of comparable Toyotas.  For example, where Toyota gives you vinyl, the Kia gives you cloth seats and carpet.

Second, I was concerned about the engineering of the vehicle.  However, I knew the 1.8L 4 cylinder engine was a proven motor.  3 years later and 90k miles I've had no problems with the engine or drivetrain.

Service is always key with any hard driven vehicle and I make sure my car gets regular oil/lube maintenance and checkups.  My brakes started wearing out at 45k.  I had them changed out at reasonable cost.  Also, I put the best tires on the Kia when they needed changing.  Don't buy the cheapest tires you can get.  Buy the best.  I bought Goodyears.  But Michelin or equivalent tires will give your car good feet.

Bottom line is that this is a durable little car that will give you good value if you maintain it.
