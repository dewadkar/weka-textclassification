            I am a young businessman who has been in the working world for no more then 2-3 years.  As I a making decent money now I decided to treat myself to a good vehicle.  I traded in my Japanese Toyota Tacoma for the American Silverado full size vehicle.  I feel that it was a great trade.  Everyone knows of the standards that the Japanese auto makers have set for reliability and durability.  Well I felt that Detroit finally caught up to our Pacific neighbors and thus took the plunge again with an American vehicle.

The full-size truck in itself was quite a luxury.  I liked having the room and the relative power that my V6 provided.  I felt that the Silverado looked incredibly snazzy and fell in love with its looks.  Chevrolet did a nice job of accomidating the ruggedness that a truck may be supposed to model with a sense of luxury with the nice seats and cozy feel of the interior.  I was very happy with my selection.

The one thing that I regret is not waiting for the one that I really wanted.  I liked the Silverado model so well that I wanted to pay a little more for the deluxe package.  I really wanted a V8 engine and the LS package.  Since they didn't have that model available and the wallet was light I settled for the quite satisfactory vehicle that I got.  My only suggestion to a prospective buyer is to wait for the one you want and then go after it.

The bottom line is that the Silverado in this year or the later models since are all great.  If you want to pay a little bit more the best, go with the Silverado truck.<br><br>
