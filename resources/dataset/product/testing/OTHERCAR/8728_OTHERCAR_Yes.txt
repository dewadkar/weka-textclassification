            I've owned this camera for about six months now - quite long considering the rate technology advances, and my buying habits.  I've been into photography for the last ten years, and currently own four Single Lens Reflex cameras (SLRs) which I use for my side business.  When I looked for digital cameras, I was really looking for a mixed bag.  I didn't want an all-pro camera that will put me into the poor house, and compromise portability/spontaneity. I also didn't want a simple point-and-shoot which wouldn't give me complete control over the exposure if I chose to.  The Epson does both admirably.  There are three different exposure modes from full-auto, to program mode (aperture/shutter priority), to complete manual.  This should please the professional photographer's needs, as well as the point-and-shooter.

Drilling down to some details.  First off, I need to correct the information as posted on this website - this camera is able to produce 2.1 million pixels, and *not* the 2.9 as posted.  The camera is able to capture, and export exposure information such as shutter speed, aperture, flash, resolution, etc.  The camera has the capability to take audio recordings as well, for making voice notes on a particular photo.  The CCD sensitivity is user selectable from ISO 100, 200 and 400. There is a flash hotshoe for you to attach an external flash. There is a Solar assisted LCD so you can turn off the backlighting and use the sunlight to light up the display.  You can take time-interval photography.  In the box, they include USB, PC and Mac serial cables, software, four NiMh batteries with charger, and a step-up ring.  The step-up ring is a big plus if you plan on using filters.  This ring will step up the threading from 43mm to 49mm allowing the use of normally available polarizers, filters, etc.  Ergonomically, this camera feels quite beefy - solid grip, and a firm feel.  My only regret is that you would need a larger bag to accommodate the dimensions of the camera - a sacrafice I was more than willing to make.

This digital camera gives alot of bang for the buck with a few things worth noting.  It comes with an 8MB card, but it can accommodate the new CF Type II cards such as IBM's Microdrive 340MB.  Flash photography with this camera sometimes casts a bluish tint to the photo - softwares such as Adobe's Photoshop can fix that. This camera takes great outdoor photos, and good indoor shots.  It can take quite a number of photos before the batteries go out. Built-in diopter adjustment so you don't have to take your glasses off.

I picked mine up for $646 through an etailer - well worth the price.  If you are looking for a digital camera that does a bit more than just taking pictures, take a serious look at the 850Z.

***Update***
I've seen this camera selling for $799 these days, and at this price, it has entered a whole new category.  My purchasing price, was $150 less, and I've learned that I had picked it up during their intro price.  At eight hundred bucks, you near some of the pro-level digitals such as the Nikon 990 which sells close to its model number - $999. If you can buy this for what I bought it for - its a great buy, otherwise start shopping around.  Another thing I want to add is that the software running the camera is a little buggy somtimes. You'd think it was powered by Windows or something, as you need to power-cycle the camera when it happens.<br><br>
