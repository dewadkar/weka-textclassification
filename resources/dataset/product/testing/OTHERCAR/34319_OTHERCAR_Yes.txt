            The Acura 3.2 tl is one of the finest examples of &quot;bang for your buck&quot; for the new century.  The Acura comes pretty much loaded, with only a few options to choose from.  The car handles like it's on rails, and the very adequate engine pulls strong all the way up to redline.  The brakes are crisp and exact, and the feel through the steering wheel gives just the right amount of feedback to the driver.  The inside of the tl has all of the options that you would find in a luxury car, including a navigation system that is pretty easy to use.  The radio is awesome, and the leather seats are very comfortable; even on very long trips.  This is one car, under 30k that will give those expensive bmw, mercedes, and audi's a real run for the money. If your going to buy a car this year, either spend a little more, or save a lot and get into the Acura 3.2 TL.<br><br>
