            The Olympus D490z is loaded with features found in higher priced models. It has panoramic (available with the software), nigh shots, zoom, movie, date, and 2.1 megapixel. With 2.1 megapixel, the pictures can be enlarged to 8 x 10. The panoramic needs to have the Olympus smartmedia.
I like this camera. It's not as easy to use as the Polaroid 640, but it has many more features and better quality pictures if you wish to enlarge them. The two things I do not like are; when you close the lens cover, you have to be careful not to hit the lens, and many of the pictures are out-of-focus if the subject moves even a little.
Most of my pictures turn out better if I don't use the flash, even inside. I get more detailed background and the background is much lighter. I am still experimenting with the many features, but if you learn only a few things at a time it is not that hard to use.
I use a flashpath sandisk for smartmedia to load the pictures onto my computer. That gives the option of deleting as I load, and renaming the pictures.
The battery that came with the camera is still at full power, even though I have taken over 100 pictures. The camera is small enough to take with you everywhere. I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys taking pictures.<br><br>
