            I can honestly admit that I am no professional photographer, but living in Hawai'i, this camera has been golden to me.  It has provided me with images that I will cherish forever (or as long as they remain on my computer).  Please forgive me if I do not use technical camera jargon.  

<b>Just look at the picture quality</b>
With the 4 megapixel resolution, this camera takes great pictures.  Pictures are sharp, great and even brighter than other digital camera images.  Indeed, I must admit that I do have a slightly shaky hand, and as a result, there have been some blurred images.  For the most part, the pictures do come out crisp, and even for those with shaky hands, there is a sports mode option, which allows you to take pictures at high speeds.  

<b>Different settings for different situations</b>
Something I admire about the LS443 is the different settings you can use to take pictures with.  The settings are Auto, landscape, sport, night and a close-up mode help to take the perfect picture in the perfect situation.  To be honest, I don&#146t ever use any other mode than Auto, but it is nice having the options available &#150 just in case you&#146re ever inclined to use them.  I feel the Auto mode takes the best pictures anyways.  

<b>Zoom Zoom Zoom</b>
The 10x total zoom (3x optical and 3.3x digital) really helps to take pictures that are far away.  The 1.8 inch LCD screen both visible outdoors and indoors also enhances the zoom.  Although Kodak claims you can view the LCD screen both indoors and out, it sometimes is hard to view it when you&#146re outdoors as sunlight does tend to glare off the screen, making it difficult to see the pictures on the LCD screen.  When reviewing pictures, you can magnify the pictures up to 4 times.  The camera also utilizes Schneider-Kreuznach Variogon lens, which apparently is used in professional photography.  Needless to say, you&#146re working with a very high tech camera, which is amazingly simple to use.  

<b>Taking Video?</b>
The camera also features a video mode, which I have used once.  For a digital camera, the video quality was amazingly good, but was of course, taken in 400x600 mode.  Indeed, it still is a decent size for a camera.  Sound is recorded through a microphone on the top of the camera, and sound quality overall is pretty good.  Video is treated like a photo and can be &#147shared&#148 from you camera to your computer through the camera dock.  I don&#146t recommend purchasing this camera if you&#146re looking to take good video clips, however.  If you want a camera that can take both video and pictures, the LS443 is a good pick; but if you&#146re looking for something that can take good videos, invest your time in a camcorder.  

<b>Menu Options</b>
The camera also has different menu options where you can set your own color contrast, take pictures in sephia mode or even set you camera to take in long time exposure mode.  These features are more for the advanced user.  Fortunately for us somewhat technically inclined folks, everything is automatic and sets itself for you unless you change the settings.  In other words, it&#146s great because the camera knows what the best mode is for you when you&#146re taking your pictures.  

<b>Camera Docking</b>
The LS443 comes with a camera dock, AC adapter and USB line.  I find the dock easy to use especially since you just press a button and all your pictures are transferred to your computer.  While the camera is transferring the pictures, it also recharges the battery and erases the pictures off your camera&#146s internal memory of 16mbs.  The picture transfer is somewhat fast, although if you use larger memory cards, it might take some time for all your pictures to be transferred (considering each picture is about 1 mb large).  The dock is also stylish (as well as the camera) and compact for easy portability. 

<b>Battery</b>
The LS443&#146s battery lasts for quite a long time.  With daily use, I have used my camera for about 7 consecutive days without charging.  Indeed, when I did need the charge the camera is did so pretty quickly.  Specifications show that the battery will last for about 300 charges.  And of course, like I said, you can charge your battery by placing it on the camera dock.  I haven&#146t charged the battery from zero so I wouldn&#146t know how long it would take to charge completely.  The most I have had to charge it has been 4 hours. 

<B>Internal Memory/Memory Cards</b>
This camera&#146s internal memory is 16mbs, which really isn&#146t anything.  The size of a picture taken by the LS443 is a little over 1 mb, so you can imagine how little pictures your camera can hold.  I think without any memory cards, the LS443 can hold 12 pictures or about 30 seconds of video.  I have a 128 Memory card which increases the memory by 10 fold.  I can hold about 112 pictures or 10 minutes of video.  Unfortunately, despite the necessity of having this card, it can be quite expensive.  This Kodak camera only uses the Multimedia card, which costs more than the other types of cards.  

<b>Style and other features</b>
I would say this camera is extremely stylish and is great for users who are advanced or amateur photographers.  It has everything needed for your photographic needs and more.  It does not come with a camera bag or any sort of case, so buyer beware that one will need to buy accessories to keep the camera safe.  

<b>Price</b>
The price of the camera is slightly expensive.  Buy it on sale &#150 Dell usually has random sales on peripherals and sometimes free shipping.  Stay tuned to their website to find a good deal.  I got my camera for 15% off and free shipping this past December.  You can find Dell Deals at dealcatcher.com (along with other deals for other online merchants such as Amazon.com and Buy.com).  

<b>Final Word</b>
Buy it and try it.  If you don&#146t like it, return it.  Stores such as Circuit City let you try things for 30 days and allow you to return products with original packaging for no restocking fees or additional charges.  It&#146s a great camera with great style and features.  Takes brilliant pictures and is clearly a top of the line camera.  Good luck.
