            I used to work in the digital imaging field, but now am a school teacher.  Photography has always been a hobby and worked in photography and digital imaging for many years.

I worked with advertising, architects and artists using both conventional and digital imaging.  I always hated the digital part of the field as it was so expensive cumbersome, time consuming and unreliable.  I always felt you got a better image, quicker and cheaper with a 35mm camera than you got with a scan or digital cameras.

I love taking pictures so when I became a school teacher I was spending a fortune on school events, documentation of science experiments and day to day happenings in the classroom.  I found photography a excellent way of recording events.  Eventually, I was given a Kodak Digital Science as a part of a Science grant.  

Wow, it was cool except for three problems.  One the quality was not all that great.  Two the camera didn't hold very many pictures and Three the memory cards were mega expensive.  I didn't really use it all that much.

This last summer I was leaving for Europe, I decided to buy another digital camera.  I wanted to take it on the trip, and I wanted an easier cheaper method of taking pictures in the classroom.

After a great deal of research I decided that a Mavica FD-91 was the best camera for MY NEEDS.

I wanted a camera that took very good quality pictures (not great, that's what my Canon EOS 35mm that I still carry is for).  I wanted it to use a cheap way of storing memory.  Floppy disks are convenient and I pay between $.10 and free a piece (after rebate).  It holds plenty of pics.  I didn't not want cumbersome cables that I will lose or have to reach the back of my computer to download.  It is loaded with plenty of features.

The FD-91 is not without flaws but has been fantastic.  I was able to travel and take 400 pictures in Europe.  Since it was stored on a floppy, universal and easy to use, I was able to stop at internet cafes all along the trip and post the pictures so my fiends at home could see them.

For the classroom it has been fantastic.  My kids love it and use it all the time.  We post web pages and take pictures of different events.

What I don't like:  1.  It is a little bigger than I would prefer, but quality is good and zoom is great.  2.  Not so great with flash pictures but not terrible either.
