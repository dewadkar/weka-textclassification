            My '96 Hyundai Elantra is my second Hyundai, that's how much I like the cars. It's fun to drive, has a great turning radius, very quiet operation and a smooth ride. My best friend drives a Mitsubishi Eclipse, and she says my car rides better than hers! She says it rides like a much bigger car.
My Elantra is responsive, easy to maintain, and very reliable. The warranty on Hyundai's can't be beat!
The price makes it very easy for average income people to own a new car that has a reputation for reliability.<br><br>
