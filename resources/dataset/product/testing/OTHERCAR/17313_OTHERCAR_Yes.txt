            Luxury sedans are quite the talk in the automotive world lately.  With these large and roomy cars becoming more sportier and faster, sport sedans may be the best term for them.  The Lexus LS 430 is a new improved version of the popular LS 400 while the 2000 Mercedes S500 is completely new since Mercedes throughout its flagship S-class sedan and started from scratch.  This review will do a comparison between these two vehicles which will provide insight on how they compare in various aspects.


<b>INTERIOR</b>

Since these cars are so luxurious, the interior is a fun subject to talk about.  First, the LS 430 which claims packs more gadjets and gizmos than James Bond's briefcase.  Let us begin.  Some of the following features of the LS 430 only come with the Ultra Luxury Package which will bump up the price, but, in my opinion, is a necessity if you opt to buy the LS 430.  One of the coolest features of the LS 430 is a cruise control system which has a 630-scanning-point, laser based guidance device which adjusts the set speed of the car in relation to cars around it.  Wow!  Pretty cool huh?  Well, let's move along.  Wonderful cooling and heating systems packed with, get this, a massage system.  A DVD navigation screen is also available for the LS 430.

Well, now that you've read what the LS 430 has in its interior, you probably think that nothing can compare with it.  You may be right, but the S500 interior isn't too shabby either.  The S500 has wonderful features for the front seats, and they do not forget about the rear seats in any way.  The rear seats have their own heating, cooling, and lumb bar controls with 4 rear air vents.  The car also comes with great navigation and audio systems.  While the S500 interior is absolutely amazing with nothing to complain about especially considering the rear seat accomadations, the LS 430 wins in this category.

<b>Winner: Lexus LS 430</b>


<b>Driving</b>

This category will examine the automobile's power, handling, and overall driving experience.  The Lexus LS 430 has a DOHC V-8 engine which pumps out 290 horsepower and 320 ft./lbs of torque.  The car can go 0-60 MPH in about 6.6 seconds.  Not too bad for a big sedan eh?  The LS 430 has a wider wheel base than the previous LS 400 which allows better handling, however, road tests tend to show the S500 has better handling.  The S500 has a SOHC V-8 engine which produces 302 horsepower and 339 ft./lbs of torque.  Zooming 0-60 in about 6.5 seconds, it slightly beats out the LS 430.  Both vehicles come in 5 speed automatic transmissions.  While the cars are very similar in power and handling, the Mercedes S500 barely edged out the LS 430.

<b>Winner: Mercedes S500</b>


<b>Appearance</b>

While I have always admired the appearance and style of the LS 400, the LS 430 is not that great looking in my opinion.  The front of the vehicle has had a complete make over, and it lost alot in my view.  The Mercedes S500 is stunning in all aspects in the appearance category.  The car looks extremely classy, luxurious, and sporty.  The AMG 18 inch wheels look tremendous as well.  Both these cars look great, but the clear winner in my opinion is the Mercedes S500.

<b>Winner: Mercedes S500</b>


The cost of these cars are very different with the S500 exceeding the LS 430 by a great amount.  The LS 430 ranges from $55,000 to $65,000 while the S500 ranges from $77,000 to $93,000.  Because of the price issue I'd definitely go with the Lexus LS 430 over the Mercedes S500.  Although the S500 has more power and other features, you are definitely going to pay for it.  My advice, save your money and go with the Lexus LS 430.<br><br>
