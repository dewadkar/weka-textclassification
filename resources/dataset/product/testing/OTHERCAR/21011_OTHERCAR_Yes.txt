            I leased about six months ago a RAV4. This followed 13 glorious years in a Toyota 1/2 ton pickup. My complete satisfaction with the pickup guaranteed that I would buy another Toyota, but I surprised myself by opting for the RAV4. I leased it because I liked the deal and the idea of turning it over after three years (I still have the pickup as well). I picked it because of its sporty look, its ride and the fact that there seem to be so few of them on the road. I rarely see another one but when I do I find that I can't take my eyes off of it. Anyway, the buckets in front are very comfortable. All controls are easy to reach and manipulate. The back seat is not big and I would not want to ride in it for a long trip but I hauled three teenagers in it last week and heard no complaints. The ride is wonderful - much better than expected. I drove 10 hours straight and found that I felt little of the fatigue one gets from that kind of trip. If you have a couple of kids or have to haul a lot of stuff it may not be the SUV for you, but I was able to fit my touring bike and travel bags in the rear with no problem. I am very pleased with my choice...the color (pearl white), moon roof, and styling make it the kind of vehicle with which you can go 4-wheeling or impress a classy date. You might have a tough time towing anything with the 4 cylinder, though.<br><br>
