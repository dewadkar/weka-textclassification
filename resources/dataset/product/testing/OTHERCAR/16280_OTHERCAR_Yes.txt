            A couple weeks back, I went to my local Suzuki dealership and test drove the new 2002 Suzuki Aerio SX sedan and Aerio SX "fastback". When the salesman brought the sedan up to the front, I was excited to be trying a good looking, Japanese-made, inexpensive car.

When I opened the driver's door, it felt solid and light, not bulky or anything. When I sat down, the chair was supportive and not too hard or not too soft. There were also knobs on the side to adjust the seating position.

The orange-glowing digital gauges are easy to read and surprisingly, not hard to find in your line-of-sight. Its mainly because the speedometer is displayed in HUGE numbers and the tachometer is also an easy-to-view bar.

The standard Clarion AM/FM/CD/cassette stereo is ok for normal use but when you want to blast your favourite song while cruising, its hard to get any bass out of the 6 speakers. Still, the stereo is very clear and does not distort at high volumes like most other OE systems.

For the driving part of the test, I was very surprised when I noticed the Aerios cornering/handling abilities. It was quick, responsive, and agile. You could make u-turns without having to heavily cranking the wheel and the small turning radius makes it easy to stay in your lane while turning. The suspension setup is ideal for city driving but when you push the car at high speeds into turns, theres not a touch of body roll. The Aerio has a very solid chassis accompanied with comfort and performanced tuned suspension.

Most importantly, the Aerio's engine. During idle, it was extremely quiet and sounded very smooth. (Not to say the 2003 Toyota Corolla is bad, but the Corolla's 1.8L VVT-i engine is very loud! It also idles somewhat rough). While driving the Aerio, there was plenty of power to get you moving from a stop. With 135lb-ft of torque produced at a numbing 3000RPM, theres tons of power. On the highway, theres still enough horsepower, 141, to make quick lane changes or passes. One of my personal favourite tests, is to cruise at about 60KM/h and shift back into second gear. When I downshifted and mashed the gas pedal into the floor, there was still a huge amount of power left to rocket me to 107KM/h even before I could look at the speedometer. The 2.0L distributorless and steel timing chained Aerio engine is definately the best trait of the car.

The materials and construction of the car is well above average and certainly above other cars in it's class. I'd say if you're looking for a small sedan or "fastback", which is essentially a hatchback, the Aerio should be you're first choice. The value is uncomparable! I loved it so much, my Aerio SX fastback is coming in a few weeks :)
