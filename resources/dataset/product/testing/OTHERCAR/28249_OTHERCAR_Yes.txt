            It's coming up on 2 years since I bought my 1999 Dodge Durango, and I am still thrilled to death that I bought it.  In 2 just under 2 years, I have put 23,000 miles on it, and have not had any major problems with it.  The only minor problem I encountered was with the lock on the rear door (it wouldn't lock or unlock from the key fob, or from the power lock switches), and it was promptly fixed at no cost to me.  I have moved large pieces of furniture in my durango, loaded it up with my son's friends, and taken it off roading, and I have never been disappointed.

Through rain, snow, and dirt, my Durango just &quot;keeps on trucking.&quot;  I loaded it up with every option except the towing package, and I love driving my &quot;luxury&quot; truck.  I test drove every SUV on the market in 1999, and I fell in love with the Durango.  I get a little nervous with my fiance' driving it (because when she drives things tend to hit whatever she is in), but she feels comfortable driving it.

The only drawback to the Durango is its gas mileage (like all suv's), in fact with my 5.3 liter v-8, I only average about 13.5 mpg, but its all worth it to drive a truck I love.

AT THIS POINT, I WOULD DEFINATELY RECOMMEND PURCHASING A USED 1999 DODGE DURANGO, AS I HAVE HAD ONLY 1 VERY MINOR PROBLEM IN 2 YEARS.<br><br>
