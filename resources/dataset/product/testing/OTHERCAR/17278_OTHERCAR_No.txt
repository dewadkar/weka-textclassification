            Recently I purchased a new Honda Accord LX coupe. I admit that I was a little reluctant at the purchase, but my significant other was quite impressed with the automobile and thus, I relented. Now believe me, Honda is certainly on my list as a great automaker because I've driven Hondas in the past and found that they outperform and outlast their major competitors. However, in particular, the new Accord coupe has left me a little disappointed. Here's why:

<b> Styling and Features </b>

At first glance, the Honda Accord coupe lacks the graceful styling and visual light-weightedness of the earlier Accord coupe models. Honda has added significant bulk to the sheet metal and has, as a result, produced a car that is too large and too bulky to be a sports coupe. Even with alloys and a spoiler the Accord lacks exciting styling, and as a performer the car suffers due to its heavy weight (significantly over 3000 lbs.). In addition, the interior of the car is strictly business as usual. Honda has added virtually nothing to the interior of the coupe that is different from the sedan. Whatever happened to Honda styling that produced the 1992 Prelude or the wonderfully erotic Acura NSX? It seems as though Honda has forgotten its passion for exuberance. The dash has neither luxury nor sportiness. Everything is rendered in cheap-looking plastic and the seats are a little too firm to be comfortable in town and too tight to be comfortable on the road. One good feature, however, is the optional 6-Disc CD changer, which offers great sound and the convenience of in-dash placement.

Other positives of the interior are the abundant storage boxes located in the center console and a glove compartment that actually has room! I have more than enough room to store driving glasses, CD's, cups, and whatever else I like. Furthermore, the front interior lights, which are mounted near the rearview mirror and flexibly adjustable,  are great for checking a bank statement or roadmap in the dark. One other thing I enjoy about the Accord is the great A/C, which swiftly cools the car even on days when it has been parked in the summer sun. I have never driven any car that had an air system quite as good as the Accord's.

Space inside is great and leg room isn't compromised on the road. Four adults can comfortably fit in the cab, though adding a fifth in the rear seat can be a bit more than just tight. Trunk space is great for a coupe and headroom in the back is ample.

<b> Mechanics and Driving </b>

The Accord is not so agile as it used to be. My new Accord, which is equipped with an automatic transmission and a 150bhp inline-4, is too sluggish for in-city driving. I had wanted a 5-speed, but the lady asked for the auto. With the air on, quick starts in the Accord are nearly impossible. The engine quickly reaches 4000rpm without even barely getting the car going. The accelerator feels a little light on the feet and the car shows its weight and bulk when rounding corners. The automatic transmission works great with the V-6, but the extra $4000 for the engine upgrade was a little more than I was willing to pay. Visibility out of the rear window can be a little poor because of the high rear brow Honda has engineered for the car. Steering is too quick and the car doesn't respond to the driver as it should. Perhaps the lack of driving pleasure that I get from the Accord is the most disappointing element of the car, when considering that Honda has such a reputation for fun, quick automobiles.

Nonetheless, in daily driving and on the road the car fares well. I consistently get better-than-expected gas mileage (21 in town/31 highway). I have had no problems with the car and can expect that the car will run for 200,000+ miles as most Hondas do. However, I won't keep the car that long because the cost doesn't warrant itself. I'm still too young for an old man's coupe. *
