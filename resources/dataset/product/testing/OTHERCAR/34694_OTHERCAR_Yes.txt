            After deciding to get an SUV for a higher vantage point while driving, we began to consider several possibilites. We looked at several SUVs including MB ML320, Toyota 4runner, Lexus RX300, Volvo XC90, and finally the X5. Our first priorities were performance and safety.  Having owned a BMW 528i for about 5 years, we were aware of the safety features and performance capabilities of BMWs.  However, we were also aware of the small issues that plague BMWs from time to time(ie, electrical issues such as door locks that refuse to open at times, warning lights that were overly sensitive, etc).  So, off we went to look at the SUVs listed above.  The MB had an even worse reliability record and the driving experience was not impressive.  The Lexus had great reliability record but we thought that it was too boring overall.  The Volvo was a first year model and we were worried about all the kinks not yet being worked out.  In addition, there was also a waiting list for it due to limited supply.  The 4Runner had a great V8 engine but the controls and dash were too plasticky and the price came close to a luxury vehicle after putting together a package that we wanted.  The steering feel of the Toyotal was also not as good at the X5.  We felt that the X5 offered the best blend of performance and safety in an SUV. We ended up with a 3.0i with premium package, Xenon lights, automatic, and rear climate package. The 3 liter engine provides good acceleration and is easier on the gas than the bigger engines. The fit and finish of the vehicle is top-notch and the dash is typical BMW in terms of gauges, controls for the HVAC and stereo. The factory stereo comes with a single CD player located behind a wood panel and the sound is adequate. A 6 CD changer is an available, albeit expensive, option. The only other option we got in our vehicle was the auto dimmer for the mirrors, which works very well by the way. The seating is comfortable for up to 5 people. Cargo space is small for an SUV when the rear seats are up but adequate when they are flattened. Road noise is very minimal and the ride is smooth. The handling is top-notch and equivalent to a BMW sedan. The maintainence program for the X5 has now been improved too. It now provides for free routine servicing for the first 4 years or 50,000 miles(which is an increase from 3 years in previous years' models). This also includes brake pads if yours should wear out during this time period. 
In terms of value for your money, I suppose you could do better with one of the other SUVs. However, if you value your driving experience, you should look at the X5. It provides BMW performance in a taller, larger package.
