            I have been the proud owner of a 1996 Dodge Avenger ES for about 10 days now. Just long enough for the newness of it to wear off and to be able to give a fair review.

First off, I was nearly floored that the ENTIRE car was manufactured in a Mitsubishi plant in Kentucky (I think). There isn't a sticker on the car that says Dodge anywhere except perhaps the VIN tag.

The car is a real kick in the pants to drive,primarily due to the 163 hp, 170 bhp, 24 valve V6 engine. It is quick from a dead stop and really stretches out on the highway.  I will admit I wish it were a little more responsive. I find myself holding it in second around town more often than I should to keep it in its power band.

The car handles like it is on rails, this is attributed to its wide stance and nearly zero hood-line (it reminds me of the 300ZX by the slope). Further adding to it is the 16 inch wheels covered by super sticky 205/55/16 Goodyear Eagles and an independent 4-wheel double-wish-boned suspension. As for weight distribution, It is fantastic! The car is a little rough around some of the poorer more traveled streets in town but on the highway it really holds the road great. 

Make no mistake about it this is a big car designed to look smaller than it really is. This is evidenced in the gas mileage which I have seen hovering around 19 mpg city/highway combo.

The interior is graced by all the standard options we have become accustomed to and many options we like. The 6 way power seat is a nice touch but they didn't seem to get it right. I have been working that damn thing for 10 days now and have yet to find a position I am really comfortable in!  I am average height and size and I find the car to have plenty of space. My two children have no problem getting in and out of the back seat with their school gear in the morning and they tell me it is a great back there.

Overall, if you are a member of the thirty-something crowd who wants a good looking, comfortable, sports-car-like ride and performance without breaking the bank or compromising your childrens comfort and safety, then this is deffinitley a good marriage of the prior.<br><br>
