            Firstly, let me start off by saying, I initially was interested in the Audi A6 2.7t Quattro.  In my humble opinion the best damn SPORT SEDAN out there.  Now this was before I test-drove and eventually bought a VW PASSAT GLS V6 with 4motion. This car is amazing.

My girlfriend and I researched a number of cars; this car was to be my first car purchased here in New York.  Her emphasis was on safety and mine on looks and performance.  You could say she was my "voice of reasoning".  Which I must admit in the end saved me $10,000.  Because after driving that A6 2.7T QUATTRO, I was ready to sell my kidney and other donor parts to have it.  She had to drag me out of the dealership, and put me on in a rehab clinic, I was addicted to that A6 2.7T Quattro.

Well after recovering, I began reflecting on my previous car a VW GOLF GTI, a true �pocket rocket�.  Needless to say I have always liked Europe based VW vehicles. But I wasn't too impressed with what was coming to the US, carrying the VW tag. I began looking at the competition, and there were some good stiff challengers out there.  It seems nearly all new sedans are bit mechanically the same.  

However, this is far from the truth once you get to know an German built car e.g. AUDI (luxury line of VW).  After reading a few hundred reviews I seemed to end back to VW.  So I decided before auctioning my organs lets take a look at this Passat.

One general observation, in the US Asian car manufactures always had an edge on German cars when comparing interior design and ergonomics for passengers.  However, all drivers knew a German car is built with driver in mind only.  It seems someone at VW was listening and watching because the new Passat blends the perfect chemistry of driver convenience and passenger comfort it a beautiful package called the PASSAT.

The build quality is truly luxury.  One look at this cars interior and you would swear your looking at an AUDI.  The new Passat seems to be based on a stretched out Audi A4.  If you're like me and believe the AUDI A6 2.7t Quattro is a beautiful car, but your financial situation cannot handle the expense of an AUDI, then have no fear the PASSAT is here and ready to be had at your closest VW dealership.

The 4-motion systems AWD, is basically the same as the Quattro and gives the driver an assurance, wherever you point this car that is the line it is going to take.  For you performance types, the �triptronic� is a gem.  This system gives you the best of both worlds AUTO for everyday driving and semi-manual for performance handling through those winding roads.  I am still breaking my car in as I brought it 11/30/01 with 2-miles on the odometer.  I can't wait until I reach 1000miles and truly open up the engine.

My car specs are as follows:
GLS V6 4MOTION with triptronic
INDIGO BLUE w/beige leather
Leather Package, Homelink, Monsoon CD-Changer, and dealer ALLOYS for $600.
