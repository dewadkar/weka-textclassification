            I went looking for an affordable car with a low interest loan, and I found my best option was a Saturn. The car is spacious, comfortable to ride in, and easy to drive. Best of all, it is easy on the pocketbook. My friends cannot believe the gas mileage I get. It is so good that they think I am lying!! We are a family of three with a large Labrador Retriever, and we find that there is lots of room for us. If you need a lot of trunk space though, you will be disappointed. Overall, I love my 2000 Saturn. I can't wait for the Saturn Picnic!<br><br>
