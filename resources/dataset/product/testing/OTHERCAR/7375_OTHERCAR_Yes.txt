            I never set out to test drive a Subaru and certainly not to actually purchase one, but that's precisely what ended up happening. I was out test driving a Mustang when I passed a Subaru dealership and wondered if they offered anything interesting aside from their popular wagons. I stopped and after a quick glance around the lot, decided the WRX was the only thing worth looking into for me. If you go to a Subaru dealership to test drive a car; be prepared for company as they do not allow you to go alone. I had to put up with a rather uptight salesman who very nearly ended my interest in the WRX. I never got to really test it's boundaries as I was busy being careful and trying to get used to the rather notchy shifts which are easily forgivable once you understand what this ride is about.
I left there feeling that I had been denied a true exposure to the WRX like a good date that got cut off short. Two weeks later I was out test driving Nissans, both the 2002 Maxima and Altima - both great cars by the way. I was really interested in the Altima, but it felt loose and unpredictable next to the precision of the Maxima. I left thinking, I had found my car and I would be in a Maxima within the week. Nearby was a different Subaru dealership and I did not know that test-driving with a salesman was a Subaru standard. I thought I'd get a solo ride with a WRX as I had time to kill and was still interested in learning a bit more. Again I was accompanied, but this time by a very different type of salesman, whereas the first one had me go easy, this one said things like, "Take this corner as hard as you dare." or "Come on, open this thing up!ï¿½ I did as told believe me and experienced a car that accelerated like mad yet refused to screech around corners taken at highway speeds. 
Now don't forget, I had test driven the Mustang (260 HP) and the Maxima (255) so I wasn't comparing the WRX to slouches. It made those two look like family sedans in the area of handling and although it couldn't beat either one off the line, I would rather be in a WRX on a race track any day. Why? It handles like nothing I have ever driven: four-wheel drive + turbo = glued to the road, glued to your seat. This car was made to lay waste to the competition and go where you tell it and get there before anybody else.
I bought one that day and I think anybody looking for a performance car should do the same unless you want to spend an extra $10,000 for some refinements. The WRX does not exactly seep excitement in the appearance department, the model I went with had 17" tires (very expensive option) and ground effects. Even with these, my best friend just sort of looked at it, looked at me and shook his head. He was not impressed at all. Then I had him drive it, and then I had to pry his hands off of the Momo racing wheel and bodily remove him. He had gotten that stupid grin that comes when you experience something you need to live fully (or at least think you do at the time).
The WRX simply put is a blast to drive, if cars have character - this one is the life of the party. It seems to just yell at cars in front of it and pray for sharp slippery corners to prove it's worth to you. I would recommend this car for anyone, it's not just fast - it's safe too. Side impact airbags will come out of the grippy cloth seats to assist the front bags in a collision. Though with the handling characteristics of this car along with standard all wheel drive and unbelievable brakes equipped with ABS, nobody may ever know this. Subaru has also updated the body to use a circular type of frame support, which is stronger and more rigid to aid further in handling and reducing body roll.
Okay, so I just praised the car I bought - biased right? Wrong, I am the pickiest driver you shall ever meet and here comes the bad stuff. The WRX's shifter simply put feels like a toy among the high tech cockpit. Although, you will quickly adapt to putting the shifter to its task of launching the car from a standstill, it stands as the most blaring quirk of this near perfect car. It does not make any sense to me that Subaru would do such a terrible thing to a sports car as having a notchy shifter more at home on a dead headed semi. The other obvious issue, I mentioned earlier is styling - the car looks common. I guess this isn't so bad though because if this car looked like it performed, you would draw a lot of attention from the boys in blue.
My only other issue is the body strength, the hood and trunk seem very weak when opened and closed. The aluminum hood in particular seems fragile to the point of worrying about denting it when closing it down. This is of course one of the reasons the car is such a rocket as it weighs a hair over 3000 pounds, a really light car by today's standards.
So the WRX does not have the refinement of the Maxima or the get up of the Mustang, but for me it falls perfectly in between. It is a category it populates solely, high performance and safety at an affordable price and a car you don't see every tenth vehicle on the streets. If you want a car that spares the leather and wood for sheer speed and handling - the WRX should be on your list of vehicles to test drive. If there's one thing I can suggest to someone buying a new car, it is to test drive anything you are remotely interested in as it is a huge investment. I never would have believed I would buy a Subaru but the second test-drive sold me and I am very happy because of it. So take the time and drive every possible candidate because you never know when that stupid grin will come.
