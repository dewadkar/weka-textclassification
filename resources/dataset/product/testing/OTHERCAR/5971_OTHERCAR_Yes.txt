            The Honda Del Sol made from 1993 to 1997 is by far one of the greatest cars ever made in my humble opinion. The Del Sol is a small sporty convertible with the known reliability of a Honda. In over four years of ownership I have never had a mechanical failure. Top off the low maintenance cost with the fact that it will get over 30mpg and you will see it is a very economical little sports car.

The Targa top gives you the benefits of a hard top, less wind noise and top maintenance, and the joys of a convertible. Pop two levers and one person can easily store the 24lb aluminum targa top in the massive trunk, flip the switch for the automatic rear window and let your hair fly in the breeze. 

The Del Sol while not a Ferrari is a very good handling car, it will corner better than many cars that cost twice as much. It also has very good power and acceleration. One of the biggest advantages to the Del Sol over its competitors like the Mazda Miata and the Toyota MR2 is the room it has. The interior provides ample space for even large folks like me. I am 6'3&quot; tall and 275lbs. and I do not even put the seat all the way back when driving. The Trunk is also very large and will hold copious amounts of luggage for those long road trips to the beach.
