            I just sold my black on black Beatle and I am torn between relief and regret. I love having the cash and in many ways I loved the car, but there were one or two annoyances that just wouldn't go away. 

I decided to test drive the Beetle because of its extraordinary styling. To my eye, it was the first design in years that didn't look like every other car on the road. 

I bought the Beetle because it was huge on the inside but relatively small on the outside. At 6' 4&quot;, I have spent most of my drive-time with seat backs cranked into a semi-recumbent position. 

Not so with the Bug. It's got headroom, with four or five inches to spare. Outside, it's small enough to zip in and out of impossible-to-find parking spaces in the California beach town I call home. 

I drove the Bug for 18,000 miles in 28 months. It was a pleasure to drive around town and delivered exceptional performance on L.A. freeways. OK, so where's my beef? 

In half a dozen services calls, mostly for the routine maintenance included in the price of the car, the VW dealer was unable to fix a balky hatchback release and an annoying source of AM radio static. Loaner Bugs and other VWs delivered flawless tunes, mine never did. 

These are small things, and I don't want to make them sound bigger than they are. But I continue to be amazed that the dealer was unable to fix them. If he had, I would be inclined to buy another VW at some point down the road. Since he didn't, I am currently disinclined to do so. 

What's the lifetime value of a car buyer? I don't know, but it's probably worth more than a door latch. <br><br>
