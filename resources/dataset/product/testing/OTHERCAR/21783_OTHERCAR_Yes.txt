            I recently purchased a 1997 Honda Civic ex 2 door.  After looking at several different cars, I decided that this was the car for me.  The main reason is the price, gas mileage and reliability.  I was able to purchase this car with only 25,000 miles, no body damage at all, virtually in perfect condition and was still able to pay less than $14,000.  

The best thing about my civic is that it's an automatic and it has cup holders.  Those were actually two very important features for my decision to buy.  I commute to work and needed an automatic for sitting in traffic.  I also drink mocha's or juice in the morning and I love having cup holders!  The car also has a sunroof, cruise control, power windows and mirrors, and air conditioning.  

There is so much that you can do to these cars.  I plan to get the windows tinted, add rims and tires, add fog lights, springs and several other accessories.  There are too many out there to list.  But they sure look good once you're done with them.  

This car has a pretty smooth feel to it.  Corners pretty well and has a bit of pep since it has a v-tech engine.

I would recommend this car to anyone who wants to get good gas mileage and has a budget of under $15k.  <br><br>
