            People will tell you that you get what you pay for when you buy this camera. That is not true. With this camera, you get less than you pay for.

I read all the reviews before buying this, but thought that I didn't need high resolution or high quality for the work I was doing. This camera was so bad that I had to return it, and could not make any use of it at all.

I have been doing digital imaging for 7 years now. I had digital cameras way back when they took 1 minute to take the picture, and you had to stand motionless while it took the picture. The pictures were blurry, and the colors bled. Resolution would be 320x200 at best.

The ePhoto Smile is worse than those old cameras. I would prefer a black and white camera. This camera creates images that are 320x200 and then scales them up to 640x480. That's right! The width is increased by a factor of 2, and the height is increased by a factor of 2.4! No effort is made by their special software to smooth the pixels or blend them at all. You see large blocks for each pixel. I would have preferred if the images where sent over as 320x200 instead of the weird manipulation they do.
If you have ever seen a JPEG image at 1% compression, where it is all blocks, well this camera is worse than that.

It is hard to understand what is contained in the pictures. The software stinks.

The nice thing is that the camera is small and looks attractive.

The camera is not worth the $59 I paid for it. Maybe for $10. I would not give this camera to anyone. It would be an insult. 

This is not even a kid's camera. This would most likely hurt anyone's eyes after looking at the images for too long.

Read the other reviews. It is probably the only digital camera I have seen with bad reviews. 

I will never buy an AGFA camera again after having put out such an atrocious product. <br><br>
