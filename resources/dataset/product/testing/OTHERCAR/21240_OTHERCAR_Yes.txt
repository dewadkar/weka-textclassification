            My mother used to have this '87 Camry.  It was the greatest car.  It lasted forever.  It was in perfect condition when we sold it in '95.  Eight years of fine service.  It had a really smooth ride and almost never needed service.  And from what I've heard, they've improved it greatly.  My best friends family only owns Camrys.  His father just bought a '99 model, his mother has the '95 model, his sister took their old '92 model, and he just got his license and will be using the first Camry they got ('88 model which is still running fine).  They love it, and I loved my mom's.  My brother borrowed that car for about a year, and he really runs cars into the ground, but this one with stood his wrath.  Anyway, it's a great car, and for a great price.<br><br>
