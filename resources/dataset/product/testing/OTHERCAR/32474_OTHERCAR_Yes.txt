            In early 1999, my mother was looking for a new car.  At first she was looking at the SUV's.  Then she came across a new 1998 Chrysler Concorde LXI.  She fell in love with it.  It is a very beautiful car.  It is black with gray interior.

It has sleek styling.  It holds to the road well.  It is bucket seats in the front and a bench seat in the back.  The back seat has a middle that folds down to get into the trunk.  The seats are leather.  It has a cd player and a tape player.  The sound system is an Infiniti sound system.  That sounds better than the Bose that was in another car that she had!!  It has power steering, brakes, power windows, power mirrors and even the seat is power!!    There is also a remote control door lock and unlock with the trunk button.  It has cruise, tilt, and digital read out.  

There is a direction panel in the center of the roof of the car.  It tells you which direction you are going in, how many miles to a tank of gas left, the temperature outside, and other things also.  There are little cubbys to place things in the middle below the cd player.  It has handles above the doors for holding on to.  They are above all of  the passenger doors.  There are also safety child door locks on the back seats.

It has a lot of room in the trunk.  It is one of the largest trunks that I have ever seen on a car.   The Concorde is a very long car.  It is kind of difficult to park if you are not used to driving it. Also the "nose" of the car is very low.  It scrapes in my uncle's drive way.  There is now way around it.  I have tried going in straight and at an angle.  It is just because the nose of the car is very low.  
    
This car drives really well.  It hangs on to the road.  For as long as the car is, it holds a curve really well.   I like the Chrysler Concorde, it has been a very nice car.  This car is loaded with all kinds of options.  Since she bought the Chrysler Concorde LXI, it also came with a video tape of the car.  This explained all of the options and how to use everything.  This car has everything, except for auto piolet!  It is loaded.

There is a lot of room between the front seat and back seat.  Even if someone had the front seat all the way back there is plenty of leg room for adults in the back seat. She has not had any problems out of this car.

Thank you for reading and have a good night!!
