            If you're looking for a luxury car, or aiming to transport a large family, this isn't your car.  However, if what you need is transportation that is reasonably priced, reliable and a definite step up from those cars that seem like they are put together with bubble gum, try a Protege.

I have had two of these cars, my first one of the old 323s, before the Protege model came out.  I bought my current 1995 Protege used 2 years ago.  It is a comfortable car with a smooth ride and has given me no significant problems. One of my favorite features is the cruise control (not included on all models) and the electric windows.  I also like how you can unlock all the doors by leaving your key in the driver's side lock a little longer than usual, and how you can lock the whole car from the passenger's side.

The upholstery is comfortable.  The factory-installed radio works well altho it seems a little temperamental when I try to play tapes and sometimes plays them in fast motion.

All this said, keep in mind that the Protege is a small car.  5 adult people can get in it, but won't be all that happy there for long periods.  Also, you can't transport anything very big -- the hatchback comes up and the back seats fold down, all right, but there is a frame which severely limits the size of what you can get back there.<br><br>
