            I bought this camera for the price - under $100.00; this is another example of you get what you pay for.

What do I like about the camera -
1)  Its easy to use, point and click.
2)  It has a built in flash, and knows when to use it.
3)  Its not too bad on batteries, they seem to last for quite awhile.
4)  Good, easy to load and easy to use software comes with it.
5)  Picture quality is OK, not REAL good but not real bad.

What I dislike about the camera -
1)  There is no viewer that allows you to see (immediately) what your picture looks like.
2)  It uses a bit of a non-standard type of memory that they call NexFlash or FlashStik.  Its available only in two sizes, 2 meg and 4 meg.  Its not overly expensive which is good, and it is easy to change out, but its not real common.

It has two resolutions, 640X480 and 320X240, it does 24 bit which means (in high resolution) it can decern up to 16.7 million colors.  It downloads to your computer via a serial port, which is NOT the quickest way to do it.

If all you have is $100.00 to spend on a camera and you want one that will do 90% of what most people use a digital camera for (sending pictures over the web), this will be a great camera for you.  If you can stand to wait a bit and save a bit more money, get a better camera for $50 to $100 dollars more.  Go for one that has a LCD display so you can immediately cancel pictures you don't like and one that accepts one of the more standard memory types so you can get 16 meg, 32 meg or bigger storage for the camera.<br><br>
