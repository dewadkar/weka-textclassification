            We bought our Dodge Caravan new in 1995.  It came with no bells or whistles or power locks.  We couldn't afford anything but the most basic model back then, so that's what we bought.  Up to that point, we had had a little two-door Cavalier, but as our kids were growing up and we were becoming acquainted with the fine art of carpooling, we decided it was time to join the rest of suburbia and buy a minivan.

Why the Caravan?  We studied the market very carefully.  We read <i>Consumer Reports</i>, and talked to all of our friends who owned minivans or SUVs (which was quite literally, <i>all</i> of our friends. The Caravan was routinely the most highly recommended.  And frankly, I liked the way it looked.  I favor its boxy, square look (as opposed to the egg-shape of other vans).  

Like I said, our van has no splashy extras.  It's two bucket seats in the front, and bench seats in the back and middle.  Nor is it a Grand Caravan, which means our minivan is about the length of a mid-sized car (an SUV could eat our van for lunch).  The only extra we got with the car was the stereo.  The lot model that we drove home had only an AM-FM radio.  We wanted a tape player, which was thrown in for free.  Oh, and we put a luggage rack on the top, which has been somewhat useful, but we probably didn't really need it.

We've had the car for five years.  Beyond the general maintenance and two car accidents, the car has not (knock on wood) had any real trouble.  As for the accidents, neither was out fault.  Once, someone blew a stop sign and hit the right back end of the car.  I was the one driving, and thankfully the van handles so nicely!  I was able to avoid hitting a tree and other traffic because of the smooth steering.  The second accident, we were waiting for a car to pull out of a parking spot in a full lot, and an SUV backed right into our driver's side door.  There is a plastic bumper-like strip that runs along the side of the van.  That was smashed and fell off.  The door was slightly dented but relatively undamaged considering the force of the hit (why people hit the gas so hard when backing out of space in a tight parking lot is beyond me).  

When we bought the minivan, I did not know how to drive, so I learned how to drive in the Caravan.  This is a great vehicle for the novice driver.  You sit up high, you know exactly where your back end is (and your front end, too, for that matter), and, as I said before, the Caravan is about the same length as a mid-sized car, so it isn't as bulky to drive as one may think.  For a new driver, it helped having a better scope of the road.  It was very easy to learn to drive on the Caravan.  We plan to teach our newly-minted 16-year-old to drive the Caravan as well, rather than our new car.  

What I don't like about the car: while the seats do come out, they are heavy and bulky and difficult for one person to do.  My husband can take out the middle seat alone, but no way I could.  And even he needs help with the back seat.  

Someday we do plan to trade in the Caravan.  One thing I will do differently is get bucket seats for the middle row.  The bench seats are getting uncomfortable for the kids as they get older, and they are definitely uncomfortable for adults.  

But we most likely will get another Caravan.  We've been very happy with this one.
