            I bought the Dakota SLT new in early 97, and now have 40k virtually trouble-free miles.  The only problem was the radio tape deck quit working after 6 months--the dealer installed a new one with no hassles.   The size is perfect, big enough to do the job, yet small enough to ease into tight parking spaces.  The ride, even with 4-wheel drive is outstanding.  This is our preferred vehicle for taking trips.  If I stay around 65 to 70 MPH, I can get 17 to 18 MPG...quite good for V8/4WD.  At 3000 miles, the oil is only about 1/2 pint low--I use only Pennzoil synthetic 10w/30.  I use 87 octane, and have no pings, etc.  I pulled a couple of the plugs this fall, and they are still like new.  The truck is still tight with no squeaks/rattles.  We have had a lot of snow this past month, and I am amazed at how well this truck handles it--I have to be careful to allow good stopping distance.  I really cannot think of any negatives with the possible exception of Dodge perhaps putting in higher gears in the differentials.  The 318 v8 is more than strong enough to handle a higher axle ratio, thus giving even better gas mileage.  I would recommend this truck to anyone.<br><br>
