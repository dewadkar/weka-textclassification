            At least not that I've seen.  And this was the car that I signed papers on.  Yes, papers were signed--before I changed my mind.

And you can do that, you know.  You are not responsible until that car is driven off the lot.  Like, all the way out the driveway; even if you are halfway out of the driveway, (which is about how it was with me)that deal is not done!    So, remember after you sign and you are walking to put key in ignition (That long walk) you can still change your mind!

Poor Mazda.  This is one of the most handsome cars in the compact class with sharper outside styling than anyone else.  It's also one of the roomiest in both front and back.  It's also one of the least advertised.  A year ago, I had no idea that there was any such car called a Mazda Protege, until I read Consumer Reports and how they felt that it was their best compact car, even if least popular among new car sales.

And this is exactly the dilemma:  Why is a car that Consumer Reports calls #1 not at the top of the new cars being  actually bought?

The reason is that Mazda refuses to do the same sort of promotion and advertising that Toyota and Honda relentlessly do.  The Mazda Protege is essentially a Japanese import that is put together with the same quality (I found) that  Toyota and Honda do.  But, Mazda's parent company Lincoln-Mercury, which are subsidiaries of Ford, actually---has decided to promote other cars.

This shows in the brochure for the Mazda Protege, which I thought misrepresented the Protege as frivolous, unsubstantial, teenybopper, and non-serious.  Things that I didn't find were true about the Protege.  And yet my Lincoln-Mercury dealer didn't even have a Protege on the lot and was very surprised that anyone would come in inquiring about one!

So, in the end, I was concerned about driving something that wasn't that popular and that I didn't see much of around.  I don't know how Consumer Reports is coming up with reliability statistics if not enough people have bought this car to have real-life experiences with it.

There were little things that bothered me that probably wouldn't bother anyone else.  I am absolutely obsessed with interiors and the fact that the Protege's door handles were of a silver (that silver gets hot in the sun!) Instead of matching the layout and fabric of the rest of the fit and finish, bothered me.  The fact that the dashboard was of a different color or shade than the radio and controls, plus the steering wheel was not of a uniform texture. Picky, picky, picky.  Still, I think that when everything of the interior fit and finish matches, is the same color and texture; it spells quality and adds to the plushness.  And interior comfort, coziness and quality is my thing!  As opposed to outside styling.

The car also seemed loud upon acceleration, then again, anything seems loud to me.

The handling was absolutely great, this could be a Honda if you didn't know otherwise.

I don't know anything about the Protege's safety record other than I certainly &quot;felt&quot; absolutely safe.  And that's how I judge safety, do I actually &quot;feel&quot; safe in the car? Not necessarily what do the safety statistics show.  Sometimes all that one can interpret from safety statistics is that there are a lot of bad drivers out there.  These statistics aren't always representative of the car's actual safety, just all the &quot;unsafe&quot; drivers!

I think it was the roominess which made me feel like it was a much larger car, that made me feel safe.  Did I mention the seat height adjustment which is unusual on a compact car?

Mazda Protege does have a cult following, and there are many on epinions who write favorable things about Protege.  I would encourage those fans to try to write to Mazda to do more advertising and promotion so that more people would know about this car and the actual sales of Protege would go up.
