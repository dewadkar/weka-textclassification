            This car is simply incredible. With 200 or 268 hp, it has the power anyone could ever want. I mean, that's how much power a lot of trucks have! But all this power doesn't mean it will have to be loud. The S80 is the quietest car I have ever driven in. You can't hear almost any outside noise, the shocks keep you from barely feeling bumps in the road. And it has an incredible dolby stereo system where even with the cheapest configurations it surrounds you with incredible sound. Starting at about 30,000 dollars this is not the cheapest car out there, but it is worth every penny. I would reccomend buying this vehicle to any driver, it has something for everybody in it, and then some.<br><br>
