            No one really *wants* to own a mini-van do they? I certainly didn't but, with 3 kids all moving into the soccer/basketball/band years... the choice wasn't really mine. We looked at a lot of mini-vans before settling on this one. Feature wise, this thing is very nice. Velour seats, dual A/C, overhead console, Infinity sound system, tilt steering wheel, driver's side airbag, and a bunch of cupholders. This is a mixed bag though. The engine is rather smooth running, features a chain instead of a timing belt to ease maintenance requirements, comfortable seating for 7 adults, and the rear door hinges at the top for ease of cargo loading.

Sounds good so far doesn't it? Where it falls short is a combination of things. The transmission is a class action lawsuit that didn't happen but should've. It's awful. Expect to replace it about once every 100k miles at about $1k per. Most items on the engine are easy to maintain. The water pump is about a 20 minute job. OTOH, replacing the back 3 spark plugs is a bit of a nightmare, not Aerostar bad but not too far behind. Fuel mileage isn't as good as it should be, it averages around 16 mpg in town. 

The fact that it's a front wheel drive based on a car chassis gives it a nice ride. It's long wheelbase smooths it out over choppy roads. Unfortunately, it also limits the tow capacity to 3500 pounds and gives it a large turning radius.

As mentioned, the rear seats can be removed to give it a nice cargo capacity. It's not a one person job though, the seats are pretty heavy and unbalanced. Fit and finish as well as quality of materials are an odd mix of good to pretty bad. The dash pad and dash trim are all fairly well fit as are the door panels and such. The overhead console and headliner scream cheap and cheesy. I guess some things had to be done to keep the price reasonable. 

Overall it's as good as anything else out there for minivans. Styling is subjective but I find the styling to be good not great but then, aside from the Honda, none of them are. Given my rather low expectations I'm happy with this van as it's pretty much exceeded them in almost all areas.
