            I wanted a small, easy to use camera to replace the 35mm point-and-shoot I usually carry in my jacket while on ski trips. The S100 has some great features for skiing: 1) The size. Fits easily in an inside jacket pocket. 2) The movie option. Ok, the resolution is pretty poor and you can't zoom but it's fun to get somebody blasting out of a chute -- 15 seconds of video is fine for this. It doesn't replace a video camera, but a few clips along with still pictures is great. Audio is good enough to catch skier comments as they pass by. Also, unlike with a bulky video camera, people don't know that you're "filming". 3) The "stitch" option to take panoramic pictures. I was impressed by both the S110's sliding window and the PC software that combined the images to create a single panoramic image. 4) Haven't wiped out yet, but the camera seems rugged enough to take some jostling. 5) Video output to hook up to the TV in the condo -- most cameras have this. 6) The LCD is bright enough to see on a bright day. 

Other cameras in this price range may have these features. I tried a Kodak DX3215 for a day and found it to be a good camera, but lacking in most of the areas above. 

The S100 negatives are the price, a 2X optical zoom instead of a 3X, and the included 8MB flash (you will probably want at least 32MB). 

I find that I am often disappointed with technology, but this is one of the few electronic items I own that I would immediately purchase again if it were stolen/lost/broken.
