            I bought this vehicle because I was looking for a world class sports car.  I have previously owned Porsches (3), Jags, and a wide assortment of other sports cars, so I felt I had a good basis for comparison.  I considered all the current Porsche models and the new Vipers when I was making my decision.  After examining the alternatives it seemed obvious that the Corvette offered by far the best value.  The cars acceleration and top speed are fantastic.  In every aspect the car is a delight.  Ride, handling, and braking exceed those of any sports car I have ever owned.  Fuel mileage is amazing (26-30 mpg at 65-75mph).  I would highly recommend the active handling option, as it makes the car nearly idiot proof.  This is the first truly high performance vehicle I have ever owned that has the reliability and comfort features to be a daily driver.  I would recommend this car to anyone.  With the proper options I think it would fill the bill for anyone interested in a high performance sports car.<br><br>
