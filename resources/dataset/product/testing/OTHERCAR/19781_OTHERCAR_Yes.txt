            I am financing a sequoia green, 2-dr 1996 VW Golf CL (1.8 L) with manual transmission, power locks, power sunroof, alarm, standard stereo(cassette) and no airbags. Presently, I am in my last year of financing and relatively satisfied. The car runs well, fun to drive, good on gas, very solid and sturdy on the highway and offers good handling and control especially in winter driving conditions.

Aside from the usual wear and tear maintenance:

1. I've had to replace bulbs and fuses a couple of times.
2. My sunroof leaked a bit during the first year but was covered under warranty.
3. I had to replace my battery after about 3yrs.
4. My alignment has never been good - always drives to the left. I had the tires checked but later was told it is a common vw problem for years!?!?
5. My side molding fell off and had to buy a totally new one because the old wouldn't stick on right even with two-sided tape!?!
6. The only biggie until now is recently I've been told to replace my downpipe which is connected to the catalytic converter. Usually, this part would cost dearly but because my car falls under a certain mileage limit, I was told I fell under a goodwill clause that dealerships have in place for unfortunates as myself. Therefore, I will only pay the labour charge.

My only complaint really is (if you can put up with the type of problems which I've listed above) how different dealerships treat you. Some are very helpful and courteous(like the one I am presently dealing with) but many of them are rude, arrogant and difficult to cooperate with. When my molding fell off, I went to the dealership where I bought the car and where I did most of my servicing, I was told to buy two sided tape which never worked out, then I was told to buy a new mold altogether. When I picked up the mold, it was a drizzly rainy day, I asked whether they could of stuck it on for me indoors...they replied by saying they would have to charge me $5.00?!?!?!At that point, I walked out and never returned to that dealership!!Give me a break, I've purchased a car from you, I've done all my oil changes and servicing from and you are going to charge me five bucks for a what is called a courteous favour!?!?

To conclude, relatively good car - but bad customer service!
