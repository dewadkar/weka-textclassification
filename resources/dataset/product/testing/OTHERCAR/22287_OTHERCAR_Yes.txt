              We bought this van because our U.S.-made van was falling apart rapidly. We liked minivans, and wanted to keep short-wheelbase. We have 2 school-age kids, both with friends and sports involvement. In other words, we haul a lot of people/stuff around. We care about safety and reliability...

What we love:

*Dual AC (an option)

*Back windows that roll down!

*Slide-by-side and disappearing &quot;magic seat&quot; that converts to tailgate seat (perfect for watching sports practices)

*Comfort, support from seats

*Visibility - best of any car we tested. This was, for us, the determining factor in buying the car. The other stuff was just extra...

*Drives like a car. Nimble and agile. Easy to park.

*Beautiful, stylish car (well, for a minivan). Interior is elegant.

What we hate:

*Cheap, small drawer under passenger seat.

*Sunglass holder, garage-door opener holder. We MIGHT use garage-door holder on vacation. Otherwise, it didn't look like it would stand up to the heavy use it would get being opened as much as I come in/out of garage. Sunglass holder just caused rattle and made me wonder when they'd fall through and hit the floor!

*Wind noise past 45 mph (this is more annoyance than hate). The super-duper stereo generally makes it so you don't notice... We had this checked. There is no water leak.

  Minivan is great. Drives like a car. It's very quiet and seems well screwed-together. I had read that it is underpowered, but have not had a problem so far (but live where it is relatively flat). I do turn overdrive off when I am merging into traffic. That is only compensation I make for the so-called &quot;underpowered&quot; engine that reviewers have complain about. (We did buy an extended warranty in case they are right!) It's responsive and fun to drive, in my opinion. It fits our needs beautifully. Can recommend it highly to anybody. This minivan makes me think I may well be driving minivans even when kids are out of house. LOVE this one.
