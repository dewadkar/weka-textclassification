            I recently leased a 200 C230 Kompressor and simply cannot say enough about it.
Where to begin????
Well first of all, there's the price.  I was able to get my hands on a limited edition C230 which included the sport package as well as many other upgrades for free.  The total price of the car was under $35,000.
The interior is nothing short of Mercedes.  It�s simple, elegant, and very comfortable.  The white dials on the speedometer and other instruments only add to the sporty feel of the car.  The Sport package gives you 2-tone grey/black seats and steering wheel.  It also includes a sporty 2-tone leather trimmed shift knob with the �Mercedes Sport� emblem right on top so everyone can see.
The performance is wonderful.  Don�t misunderstand, this is not a powerhouse in which to race a Corvette LT1, or a Mustang Saleen.  However, the supercharged 4 cylinder gives you plenty of pull both off the start and at highway speeds.  The Mercedes also gives you the option of driving in automatic, or in 4-speed manual.  The manual is a bit quirky, but once you get the hang of it, it�s tons of fun.
Styling is very close to the AMG C43, which makes this car a real head-turner.  Also, Mercedes has seen fit to place the word �Kompressor� on the back of the car, opposite the �C230�.  This, along with the larger wheels and the �Sport� badging that come with the sport package make this car look like the marvel of German engineering that it is.
This is my first �new� car, and my first Benz.  I have to admit that driving a car like this makes me feel like a million bucks.  I know it�s not the most expensive Mercedes out there, but who cares.  I now get to sit behind a soft, leathery wheel with the majestic 3-point star staring me in the face.
It�s true what they say, own one and you�ll know.  Nuff said.
