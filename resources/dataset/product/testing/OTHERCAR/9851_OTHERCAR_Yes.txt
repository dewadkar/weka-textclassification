            I was in the market looking for a new car to replace my wife's 95 Neon. I  test drove six different brands of cars, and for curiosity I decided to test the Nubira 2000. I am a little difficult to convince by salespeople because I have been working for about 30 years in the automotive enviroment including Chrysler, Fiat, Mazda and GM, in the manufacturing sector and I know how they explain to the potential customer the characteristics of their products. So, I decided for my self in a road test.
When I tested this Nubira I was tremendously impresed about its smooth drive, its equipment, and efficient powertrain. Then I made my decision and I bought the car.
Two weeks later my wife and I went on holidays and drove about 3000 kilometers and it confirmed my decision of purchasing the Nubira, to be the right one.
Because of my job, I have owned and driven at least 20 different brands: American, European and Japanese. This is the best in its range: full of equipment, it doesn't have to envy anything from a BMW 328, VW Jetta, Lexus or even Audi except the brand name.<br><br>
