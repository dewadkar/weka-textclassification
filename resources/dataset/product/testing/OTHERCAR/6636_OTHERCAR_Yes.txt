            After having driven two Toyotas, one a Corolla and the other a Tercel, I decided that I would stick with Toyota unless something knocked me over with its greatness.

I thought that nothing would beat out a new Camry or Corolla, but what did I know?  I had come across VW's website (www.vw.com) one day, and the look of the car caught my eye.  The newest body styling has made the Jetta (along with the other VW lineup) more than easy on the eyes.

But, could this car REALLY beat out a Toyota?  Well, I didn't think so, but I took a test drive nonetheless.  I must say that I was very impressed.  The car handled like a dream!  Everything is very easy to find, and there are plenty of toys to play with, even in the basic models.

I chose to purchase a GL 2.0L manual because this car is peppy enough to not need a V-6, and the manual transmission gives me better gas mileage.  Sticker says 26 City, 31 Highway, but I've found that with both highway and city driving I'm averaging about 28 miles a gallon.  Not bad, especially with the 40 mile round-trip commute I have to work.

Other features include:

SAFETY - Safety SHOULD be a top priority for any car buyer.  VW does not let you down.  The Jetta has dual front airbags, duel front side airbags, three-point seatbelts for the back seats and three head rests.  Thus, the person stuck in the middle does not risk only having that dreaded lap belt.  The dash is lit in blue to help with night driving, and daytime running lights are also standard.  ABS brakes round out the safety features, and I've already had to test those out on more than one occasion...  

SOUND - While nowhere near as important as safety, sound does play a major role in the car.  Whether you frequent AM talk shows or listen to CD's the Jetta's Monsoon sound system is going to suit your needs.  Eight speakers help to create a smooth system, and the base is not bad at all.  You can opt for a CD changer, but a CD player does not come standard.  That is the only drawback I've noticed about the Jetta.  

DRIVE - As opposed to my Toyotas, the Jetta handles the road in a much smoother fashion.  Cornering is about equal to my old cars which means that you will have a terrific time if you like to drive on those curvy country roads.  All in all, this is a fun car to drive.

COMFORT - I chose the leather seats with the heated front seats because comfort is very important to me.  The GLS offers lumbar support, but my model does not.  As it is, I haven't found it lacking.  My 6'2 boyfriend fits into the car easily, but the back seat does not offer too much leg room.  

STYLE - I don't see VW changing the style of the car in the near future.  These models have become extremely popular.  I opted for the mudguards and front hood cover.  Tinted windows can round out the entire package.

PRICE - The Jetta comes with almost everything standard, thus is higher price.  However, when you add on the same features to the Toyota the prices come out very comparable.  

I am very pleased with my car.  The dealership experience was typical, however I had done all of my research on the internet, so I ended up getting the car at a couple hundred over invoice.  Not bad for a model as popular as the midlevel Jetta.  I recommend research invoice prices and test driving different models.  Hopefully, you will have as good of an experience as I had!<br><br>
