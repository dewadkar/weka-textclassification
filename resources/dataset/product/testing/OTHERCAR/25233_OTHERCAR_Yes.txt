            The firms Hewlett-Packard and Pentax have agreed upon joint manufacturing of digital cameras. Taking into account richest experience of Pentax in production of cameras and the usual high opinion about its production is necessary to mark it as a very good step. One from the first products of their joint activity is this 2.2 megapixels camera. On appearance this camera very much reminds traditional film camera - both on a size, and on controls. But it is only external visibility, because between digital and film cameras exist very many differences.

This camera is very interesting just on the design. Furthermore, it is the good manual for learning to principles of photography, both on digital, and on classical cameras. For the photographer, if he wants to realize, that he does during shooting, it is important simultaneously to see object and parameters of shooting. Therefore it is very pleasant, that the information about parameters of shooting is visible in the viewfinder. Certainly, it is possible to use information on LCD screen and to use just it as by viewfinder, as is done in most of digital cameras. 

A matrix here, apparently, not so sensitive, because a range of sensitivity is from 25 up to 400 ISO. Normal it is considered 100 ISO, and if to take into account, that up to this significance there is many more gradation, the actual sensitivity of the camera somewhere 50 units. The snapshots show that in shadows noise at the camera rather large. But at all quality of shoots is very fine. I didn't find any considerable defects.

It is necessary to mark that though optics unchangeable, the possibilities to increase a range of a modification of a focal length are rather great. The thread under light filters �49 allows easily to apply accessories of many manufacturers (including, and to video cameras). As at many digital cameras, the modification of a focal length is carried out the electromotor. Sharpness is setting too through the electric drive with the help of mini-joystick on a backboard. A manual focussing is discrete - 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.5, 3.0, 10 meters and infinity. The significances of a distance are mapped on LCD screen. It here is made turning, that very conveniently and allows it to use it as the viewfinder. 

Now about connection to the computer and other devices. It can be connected through port USB and, as the camera is rather big, it is not required any special cables, it is quite connected standard (same, as are connected, say, printer and scanner). The data transfer through infrared port is stipulated. Transfer from the camera on the camera, on the printer and on the computer here is possible. In the menu it is possible to set only two formats - 1600�1200 and 800�600, format TIFF or JPEG.

The switch of the menu has four positions: shooting, view, operations with the shooted frames and connection with the computer. The latter is necessary only for through USB. The flash is lifted above camera. Is present also standard plug with one central contact for connection of external flashes. The controls of the camera are rather convenient. 

On a backboard is located LCD screen with three buttons from above and three from below. Upper is menu, display, microphone (the camera has a possibility to note the sound comments to frames), lower is contextually are depended that is mapped a screen of the menu. Near is a wheel of choice of modes: record, view, work with frames, computer and mini-joystick for navigation on the menu. The inscriptions on the menu can be given in three languages and are located outside of a screen. There are options - white balance, automatic, daylight, lamps, fluorescent lamps and 5500�. Possible choice ISO is 25, 50, 100, 200, 400. There is a possibility of slide-show. The search of shooted frames is made by date of and on a category.

The camera feeds from four elements ��, it is desirable to use accumulators. It is necessary to mark that it has a short battery life. The voltage of external power supply unit is 9 (but not 6) volt. If to connect to the external plug 6 volts, the camera will not be to work.
