            When the car was my sister-in-law's, I loved it. I loved it so much that when she traded it in for a new Camry, me and hubby went to the car dealer and bought the Corolla that she traded in. When I bought it, it had over 150,000 miles on it and it ran bad because she didn't take good care of it. Hubby put in a new gas filter, air filter and oil filter and it purred like a kitten. It was perfect. It just needed a little TLC. We gave it that and it has never given me ANY trouble at all. It's even been in a few wrecks in its lifetime. Like Timex, it takes a licking and keeps on ticking. It is one of the best cars for gas mileage and sharp turns. There isn't much I don't like about this car, except that the backseat has little leg room for adults. It's perfect for kids though. We have driven it back home to Louisiana several times in it and it has never left us on the side of the road. If you want a good car, get a Toyota. If you take care of it, it'll go forever. Mine has over 183,000 miles now and it will go 183,000 more miles!<br><br>
