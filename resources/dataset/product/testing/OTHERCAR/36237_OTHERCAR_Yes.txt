                 I purchased a 1991 Mitsubishi Galant VR-4 in January of 2000 and love it.  I fell in love with it the first time I saw it.  After I drove it there was no question in my mind that I should buy it.

     The engine is extremely powerful, especially for a four-cylinder.  It uses the same 195 horsepower, 2.0 Liter, Dual Overhead Cam, turbo charged and intercooled engine that is used in the Mitsubishi Eclipse of the same era.  This engine is designed to rev to high rpms.  The turbo doesn't seem to have any effect until you get over 3000 rpms, but when it does kick in you know it.

     The handling of this car is great in all weather conditions and speeds.  This is made possible of what Mitsubishi calls Active-Four Technology, which includes full time all-wheel drive, four-wheel steering, four-wheel independent suspension and an ABS system with sensors on all four wheels.  The four-wheel steering, which improves high speed cornering, is only active at speeds above 30 mph.

    Overall I feel that this car is great for everyone, from the most casual driver to most hardcore enthusiast.  The enthusiasts will also appreciate the fact that it is a limited edition model.  Only 2000 were brought into the United States in 1991.  This car is one of the best blends of style and performance that I have seen in quite a long time.<br><br>
