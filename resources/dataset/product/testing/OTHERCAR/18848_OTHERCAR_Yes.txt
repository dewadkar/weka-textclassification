            I live in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, where it snows a lot and commuting to work sometimes means traveling over 50 miles.  I took a job about 60 miles away because of the great pay, but I needed to have a dependable, fast vehicle, that was good in snow and ice, and not bad on gas.  My other concern was, of course, looks and comfort.  
What can I say I love the sporty-looking vehicles.  I looked at various Chrysler/Dodge products, but they were just too darn expensive, so I decided to give good 'ole Chevy products a try. I went to a local dealership.......and then I saw it--a beautiful white Monte Carlo with white color-coordinated rims and a spoiler on the trunk.  I looked at that car, thought, &quot;Now, there's a sharp car&quot;, and asked to test drive it.  
After test driving it and scanning all it's safety features (anti-lock breaks, driver and passenger air bags, etc.), I decided to test out it's performance.  It stopped practically on a dime, and never fish-tailed on icey roads like my former rear-wheel drive cars.  The seats were comfy and it had a great sound system in it.  The price was right too, so I bought it and have enjoyed it's dependability ever since.  I've yet to have to bring it to a shop for anything more than maintenance.  I have over 100,000 miles on it, it's easy to park, easy to drive, very responsive, attractive, has huge trunk area and roomy interior (for a two-door model),and handles beautifully!<br><br>
