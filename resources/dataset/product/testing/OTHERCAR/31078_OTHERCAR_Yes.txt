            The Toyato Tundra is a sweet truck, it has so many positive aspects to it, including its excellent reliability, and the fact that it can TAKE A BEATING! TRhis car is really nice off road and it should be the number one truck in America. It is ten times as good as the Ranger and is 20 times as good as the Ram. I love this Truck also because it is a Toyato, and Toyatos have alwsys been one of my favorite cars because of there reliabilty, and the way they treat you as customers.


They are very costumer friendly and treat you very well. When it comes to haviong problems with the cra they are very urgent to fix it, and get the job done fast.

The Tundra is great and I recommend it to anyone.<br><br>
