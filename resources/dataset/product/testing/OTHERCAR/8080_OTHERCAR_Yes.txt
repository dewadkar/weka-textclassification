            We have always purchased GMC vehicles.  We upgraded from a car to a van for more passenger room.  This van seats 8 people with plenty of room left over.  I love this van for many reasons.  One being the safety features.  It is taller than most vans and when you are driving you sit up above the rest of the cars on the road.  This makes me feel safer because I have a better view of what is up ahead of me. Also, I feel that if I was to get in an accident, I would be safer because the cars would crash into the lower part of the van, not directly into the passengers.  Also it has a very smooth ride, not bumpy like some vans I've been in.  You get a lot for your money.  All of the passenger seats are removable.  This gives you great flexibility in hauling all kinds of things.  We can fit our kids and their friends, plus all there stuff in the van with no problem.  We took our three kids and drove to Arizona from California.  It was a wonderful experience, thanks to the Safari Van.  I would recommend this vehicle to anyone who wants a luxury car in a van.  It gets good gas mileage, has all the latest features, and wonderful colors to choose from.  I recommend it very highly.<br><br>
