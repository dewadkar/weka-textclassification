            One year ago last month my wife and I traded in our 87 Legend (paid $22,500) for the 99 T.L. priced at $27,950. We really liked our 87 so when the 99 T.L.'s came out, we took it for a test ride and were blown away. The handling and ride of the T.L. is outstanding, and acceleration is first rate; far superior to our 87 Legend. Fit and finish is excellent and the body integrity is good except for one serious flaw. I think wind noise at highway speed is excessive and seems to come from the outside mirrors. The seats are very comfortable and fully adjustable. The car comes with automatic transmission that can be shifted manually if you prefer. During the test drive it was fun to use but has not been used by either of us since. The dash looks great especially at night with very easy to read gauges in red and white. The problem is, reading the odometer and outside temperature readout during brite sunlight. They are white and at times is hard to impossible to read. If it were green there would not be a problem. There is plenty of power but unfortunately premium is needed for fuel. We average about 21 - 22 mpg. The car comes only one way, fully loaded. The Bose stereo is outstanding. The only options were a two thousand dollar global tracking system and a six disc changer in the trunk. We did get the six disc changer and I have one complaint with it. You can random play only the disc you are listening to. Ideally, it would be nice to random play all six discs at the same time.  Dollar for dollar I don't know what beats the T.L. With a few tweaks here and there, Acura can make a great car outstanding.  <br><br>
