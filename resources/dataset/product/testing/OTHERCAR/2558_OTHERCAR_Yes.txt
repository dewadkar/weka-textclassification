            I have owned an Extended 4 Dr Montana for 2 years now. It is great on the highway for ride and gas mileage (26mpg). It has had only minor problems thus far. The original OEM tires are not the best, but they are okay. Stopping distances are too long, but the handling is nimble with good engine performance to add. Unfortunately, there is noticeable torque steer during hard acceleration that takes some getting used to. The integrated child seat is the best! It is easy to use, safe and does not make the kids seem confined. One noticeable complaint is interior cabin noise is louder than some competitors. Also, the cabin air filter is rather pricey to replace -- $65 for parts. Suggested to be replaced annually.
