            Purchased a 1999 Sahara Edition (top of the line) Wrangler brand new.   Was purchased as an off-road/snow capable general purpose vehicle.  Never got to test the off road capabilities due to constant mechanical problems.  4 years later I am selling it while it still runs...

It's loud on the highway, but what do you expect from an off-road vehicle?

Within 500 miles the automatic transmission had a complete failure and was replaced under warrantee.

Within 2000 miles the instrument cluster became intermittent with all gauges dropping to 0.  Fixed under warrantee.  Dealer said "They all do that, the connector falls off the back."

While under warrantee the Sahara was back to the dealer 3 times for loud popping noises from the rear differential which they could not explain. (I know it's the limited slip clutch packs sticking.)  Each "attempt" at a fix is limited to changing the differential fluid.

Hard top leaked water on seats from the first day it was off the lot.  Took 3.5 years and complaining about it during every dealer visit (15-20) to get the top sealed.  Needless to say I have never attempted to switch the soft top on.

Steering box failed with excessive slop in system at 28K.

Rear axle seal failed at 30K.

Oil pressure sender failed at 40K.

The plastic oil filler cap has an internal ratchet that broke.  Very weak internal design.  No way to add oil to the car until it was removed by smashing it apart to get at the internals.

All joints require lubrication with a grease gun every 30K miles (vs. most modern cars using sealed joints).

Draining the transmission for a fluid change requires dropping the pan vs. just having a drain bolt like other cars/trucks.  Pan uses a cork gasket that the dealer wanted $45 for!  Cork gasket on a 1999 vehicle???

Many of the exterior fasteners have rusted (in California!) to the degree that I have replaced them with stainless hardware.

Very poor dealer support.  On two occasions the dealer parts rep could not even find the parts I was trying to buy.  Some parts are in the computerized catalog, others in a printed catalog!  Huge dealership has a single counter person that also services the phone while trying to wait on customers.

Dealer could not duplicate a key in 4 tries.  I finally had to take the improperly cut blanks and re-cut them myself.

While researching the oil sensor problem on the net I discovered that many of these problems are not unique to my Wrangler.  Many people have had the same problems, sometimes multiple times.  This indicates poorly designed or built parts that Chrysler/Jeep just keep selling to replace the units out in the field when they fail.
