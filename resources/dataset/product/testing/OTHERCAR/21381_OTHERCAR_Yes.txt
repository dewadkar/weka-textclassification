             We had a Ford Aerostar Van that had depreciated in value $10,000 in one year. We were shocked &amp; disgusted. We had bought the van thinking that when we would trade it in after a few years, we would have a good down payment. We could tell this was not to be.We owed so much more than the  van was worth.
     We were finally able to get out of the van with a brand new Toyota Camry. I can't tell you how much I love this car. This is the fourth new car I've owned &amp; is by far my favorite. It is such a good looking car &amp; drives like a dream. It is so quiet inside that car when you're driving &amp; is always a smooth ride. We have the deluxe model with the moon roof, CD player &amp; leather seats.It is so well made &amp; I know the reputation that Toyota has. I owned a used Corolla one time &amp; that car never gave me a bit of trouble. I will drive this car for many years. I truly enjoy it &amp; feel so proud to own something this nice. After my divorce, I had a very old used car that wasn't at all dependable. I think that may be why I appreciate &amp; love this car all the more.
       Even my husband, who is a Ford man likes this car a lot. He always wants to buy American, but he is sold on the car.He knows it is very dependable and will not lose all of it's value. You see so many Camry's on the road and after driving one it is evident why.
