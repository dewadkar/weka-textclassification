            Why did I buy this vehicle?:

 Beauty- My Champaign colored Audi 100 is clearly the classiest looking car I have seen. For those that don't know what the champagne color looks like, it has a luminescence that none of the other manufactures can match. This car, this color, turns heads everywhere. The Audi 100 has a classic styling that still looks current. The interior is roomy and comfortable. The instrument controls are large enough so that they can be happily accessed by my wife who has long finger nails. The amber instrument lights add to cockpit feel of the interior. It handles with intensity and insolent skill. The car is very nicely balanced in a neutral way on winding country roads, or dodging those who seem to have no idea what they are doing on the road. The unique Audi five cylinder engine provides both good fuel economy (I�d say about 26 mpg) and great acceleration. But with that great acceleration, there needs to be good brakes, which it has. It likes to cruise happily somewhat north of the speed limit. Durability and reliability have been outstanding on this car with 160,000 miles. For all the people who think they need a SUV in the winter, this quattro model will track its way through anything winter can serve up! 

What do I love and hate about this vehicle?:

I really love the beauty of the car and consequently hate side by side parking because I�m always worried about someone dinging the car. I also don't like the fact that many of Audi's parts are unique to Audi cars and consequently quite expensive. I also like the fact that Audi put the battery under the back seat where it is protected from the elements. So it still looks like new but more importantly seems to last forever! I still have the original battery. 

What is it like to drive this vehicle?:

My vehicle is an automatic and is geared well for both around town driving as well as highway cruising. The stirring is tight and has a typical European feel. The ride is firm and also extraordinarily comfortable. I am able to ride around town not thinking about my safety because I trust this car, not that I trust the others on the road, but I trust this car and it's safety. Its ride is luxurious and enjoyable. 

Who should and shouldn't buy this car?:

Anyone who doesn't want to buy a brand new car that is going to be very expensive should buy this car. This car is great and pretty reliable.
