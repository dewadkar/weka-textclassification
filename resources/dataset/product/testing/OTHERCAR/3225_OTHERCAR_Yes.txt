            When I test drove this car, I really took the car to it's limits and thoroughly enjoyed myself doing so.  I did need some tips on utilizing the Touch Shift mechanism to downshift.  Having previously owned a bmw 328i sp pack manual, i realized that the c230 K was not as quick and didn't handle as well but it was more luxurious, spacious, and stylish. So was it fast enough for me? yes, it was.  And with the Special Edition, it had everything I was looking for in a car and with the upcoming 2001, I was getting an awesome deal to drive home a Benz.  I just couldn't say no.  I especially liked the carbon trim, dual tone seating, Merecedes Benz door sills, sport package features, ESP, BAS, folding seats, sunroof.  The only thing I added was a trunk CD changer.  

It was a great deal for entry-level luxury cars with a sporty spirit.  plus it's trustworthy german engineering.  I prefered it over comparable acura, audi, and bmw.

Downsides:  I miss having a manual.  the esp kicks in a little too quickly for my driving spirit, i wish the sp package mechanics were a little sportier(shocks, tires, suspension); a little more power especially below 2500 rpm, Steering should be R&amp;P.

Some people might mind the engine volume but it doesn't bother me.  I enjoy the sound it makes when you push the car.  Some prefer the new 2001 C.  Yes, but can you get me a comparable car for 32k?  I think not.

Otherwise, it's a majestic car with a dynamic personality.  Great car overall for the price.  Finally something the wife and I can both enjoy.<br><br>
