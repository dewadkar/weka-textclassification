            I worked my butt off in high school and so far my first half of college so that I could purchase a car, not lease, or pay off in installments.  I went searching this past summer and was at my local VW dealer.  I fell in love with this car the moment I got in.  When you drive a VW you DRIVE a VW.  For those who like to have power under the hood there's nothing like a Jetta.  The pick-up is great.  I've found myself driving for no reason other that to drive.  The handling is superb.  Going around corners is very smooth and the engine is un-Godly quiet even in 5th gear doing 85mph. It was very affordable as well I got mine for $12k.  Depending on the dealership you purchase it from the warranty is basically the same.  For mine since it was fresh off a 2 year corporate leas ei had the original warranty extended (4 years after I purchased it or 24,000 miles).  The warranty includes free roadside assistance (they will tow you to the nearest-regardless of distance-VW dealership and perform the repairs).  The repairs are covered in the typical 'bumper to bumper' deal.  Here's something to know though.  You will NOT get this if you buy a VW from a NON-VW dealership.  So if you're seriously looking into a VW then stick to the VW dealerships.  It has in many ways changed my lifestyle.  It's not the &quot;I'm better than everyone&quot;--because I'm not.  Rather it's more like &quot;This is cool&quot;.  I'd have to agree with a fellow reviewer in saying owning and driving a Jetta makes me feel cooler.<br><br>
