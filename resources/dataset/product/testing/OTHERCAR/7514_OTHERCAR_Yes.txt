            We bought our Stratus new back in '96 and have not regretted that purchase in the least.  We wanted an 4 door that was both fun to drive and economical.  We needed 4 doors cuz we were starting our family, we now have 2 children and this car is still big enough for long trips with all aboard.  Our Stratus now has 72,000 miles on it and very few problems have been encountered.  On the highway we get about 32 to 35 MPG and 25 to 28 in city traffic.  (This beats our other car, a smaller and more cramped Golf) One reason for such good mileage is a 5 speed manual transmission, which we prefer over automatics.  Without the manual tranny, I wouldn't recommend the 4 cylinder engine, go with the 6.

A big criticism of this car by some is it's supposedly harsh ride.  I prefer to call it &quot;sporty&quot;.  The car rides rougher than say a Camry, because it's tuned to handle the road.  I can honestly say this car, on a twisty road is a blast to run through the gears with, the more so when you know your not driving some gas-sucking V8 (or 6).

Finally, I'm 6'3&quot;, and am very comfortable in the front seats, in the rear we have 2 kid seats right now, and have occasionally put an adult back there as well, wouldn't recommend it for a long haul, but the back is quite roomy.  Highly recommend this car to anyone looking for a roomy, fun to drive and fairly economical ride.    <br><br>
