            My husband and I just bought a used sable wagon this weekend, so we haven't driven it too long.  But I read all the reviews on this site when we were still looking at it, and they helped a great deal!  Thanks!

The one we bought has just under 100k miles on it, but it still drives great, and is a wonderful upgrade from the car we owned before.  My parents have a '95 or '96 Taurus and even with hard over-mountain driving, they've gotten over 200k out of it and it's still going, so we're expecting to hang onto this one for a while...especially because we live in the flat, flat heartland!

The seats are really comfortable, even when riding for a long time.  The stereo system is great - we blasted U2 and were certainly not disappointed.  My only complaint about that is that when plugging our CD player adapter into the cigarette lighter, we can't have the console all the way open.  Our drinks sat at a funny tilt.  We're looking for the CD changer for which the vehicle is equipped, though, so that should solve that problem.  Not interested in getting it from the dealer from whom we bought the car - anyone know where we might find it cheaper than the several hundred dollars (equipment and installation) they quoted us?

Also love the A/C and how responsive it is.  Amazed by the smooth ride, even at its age, mileage, and higher speeds.  I don't like driving big cars, but this one doesn't feel as long as it is when I'm driving.  It handles nicely, and feels heavy enough to be safe while not driving like a boat.

We love the size of the cargo area, and how the second seat backs fold down individually.  It's certainly a feature we will use a lot.

The gas mileage is fantastic.  Since we bought it, we've put about 250 miles on it, and we're only at half a tank.  This was a huge consideration for me, since I don't want to buy gas all the time.
