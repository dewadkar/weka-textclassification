            I am a Computer Arts major who needed a versatile camera.  After extensive research and comparison I decided on the Nikon Coolpix 800.  This camera can do it all for a very small price!.  The features that made me decide on the Coolpix 800 were:
 1) its capabilities.  The capability that I found most impressive (especially for my personal needs) is the Multi-shot mode.  This camera can take up to 30 frames per second.  I have actually created videos using the VGA and Ultra HS modes.  This camera shoots with such precision that I was able to just put the shots together and, with no effort of my own, create flawless video!  
2)  This camera is capable of shooting images that print out with amazing quality up to 11&quot; x 14&quot;.  When downloaded to the computer, the shots come out at approximately 22&quot;x17&quot; at 72dpi.  I have been able to manipulate the images to an amazing 300dpi 20&quot;x25&quot;.  These images have also printed with amazing quality! 
3) There are an incredible amount of other features  on this amazing camera.  You must check it out for yourself.

I had already owned an Olympus D340R and a Kodak DC260 which are no comparison to this Nikon.  I also considered purchasing the Kodak DC290 or the Nikon Coolpix 750 or 900.  However, the Coolpix 800 has more capabilities than all but the Coolpix 900.  My reason for not going with the Coolpix 900 was that for about $200 less, I was getting a camera with almost all the same features! 

THIS CAMERA IS A DEFINITE GREAT DEAL!!!<br><br>
