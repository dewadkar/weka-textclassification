            The digital dream is the ideal first digital camera. I am currently a 
student and wanted a cheap and cheerful camera that i could get great 
pictures on. When i found the digital dream i was amazed at the price! 

With all the possible features it includes i thought it was to good to be true. Well i found out that its a pretty good camera. I found a few slight problems that i have described below but on the whole i couldnt really moan for the price i paid. You get what you pay for.

<b>Features</b>

Photos (1600x1280 interpolated)
Movies (with sound)
Sound Only
Webcam ability
LCD Display (1.5")
8mb Internal Memory
Expandable Memory via Smartmedia card.
Case - included
Strap - included

I have found that the quality of prints from this camera have been very good. Putting the pictures on the highest resolution meant that i could only take about 20 with the internal memory. Therefore i added a 64mb memory card into it and i was able to hold at least 100 photos. I also 
increased the movie capacity to around 7-8 minutes. As well as giving me plenty of time to record sounds.

I have yet to try it as a pc webcam so cannot really tell you much there. 

I have found the LCD display very useful even though it is quite small. You cannot see detail to easily on it, but you can get the just of what you have taken.

It is also very lightweight and small even with the batteries.

<b>Problems</b>

I have found this camera to have a few problems, these include:

Battery Life 

This camera is a battery killer! I eats 4 x AAA batteries fast. I reccommend for any digital camera that you get rechargable ones or there is no point of getting one. The meter that tells you the battery life sometimes lies, and it will turn it self off saying 'battery low', which i have found annoying.

Taking Pictures
I have found that it is an acquired touch to take a picture on this camera. The button is rather hard to take one with, but it took me an hour or two to master it. This is annoying for people takin pictures of you or others though as they find it hard. This may just be a defect on my model.

The shutter lag is ok. There is a bleep to tell you the picture has been taken but i would wait a few seconds before moving the camera because i have done so and recorded blurry pics!

Apart from that its good!

Lastly i would just like to say the cheapest place that i found was Ebuyer.com, with Amazon.com closely behind.

I hope you found this helpful
