            My 1998 BMW 328i Sedan has the optional &quot;sport package&quot; that included larger wheels, different suspension, and sport seats.  It is a 5-speed manual transmission.  It replaced my 1994 Acura Integra GS-R Sedan.   I wanted something fast and sporty that I could have fun with.  I didn't need a lot of room.

The car has been a blast to drive.  I can say that each time I get behind the wheel, I can count on my BMW to bring a smile to my face.  It hasn't paid me back with the reliability of a Honda or Toyota, but it will run circles around most of the competition.

I drive my car on the track with the BMW Club of America.  The car will perform flawlessly when flogged around the track weekend after weekend.  I think it loves to run hard.

It is very good on gas!  I can average over 30 mpg on the highway, while a combined city trip will average 24-25 mpg.  Amazing for the power.

The downside is reliability.  The car needs constant attention.  Small electrical things are always creeping up... make sure you have a warranty.

Overall, the joy of driving has outweighed any reliability issues.  My next car will be a BMW.  No other manufacturer can come close to the feeling!

PROS: Handling, Braking, Acceleration, Stability on the Freeway, Safety, Smoothness of the engine, Visibility outside the windows.

CONS: Reliability (fuel sending unit, transmission), Squeaks (doors, clutch), Lack of rear seat room, Price.<br><br>
