            Originally, my husband and I bought a 1995 Lumina.  It was a wonderful car until the transmission went out.  It had over 90,000 miles on it, so I wasn't really that surprised when it went out.  I even partly blamed it on my husband because he never had the transmission serviced.  So, when we decided to trade cars, we wanted a newer Lumina.  We bought a 1998.  We have had the car for a little over a year now.  It has 47,000 miles on it.  

At 42,000 miles the transmission went out.  Naturally, it was no longer under warranty, but no transmission should go out at only 42,000 miles.  We called GM to try to get some assistance in having it replaced.  NO SUCH LUCK!  Luckily, the dealer we bought the car from felt differently.  They helped us by paying for all parts.  We only had to pay labor.  We got a new transmission put in for around $700.00, which is still not cheap, but it beats $1500.00.

At 46,000 miles the alternator went out.  We spent close to $200.00 putting a new alternator on.  We have had to have the brakes done three times in the past year.  One of the door locks quit working.  The hooks that hold the sun visors on have both broke.  You can pop them back into place, but they always fall out again.  Now, we have noticed that the air conditioner does not blow cold air when you are sitting for more than a minute or so.

We are very disappointed with this car.  We hope that others are not having as much trouble as we are.  We did not expect GM to replace anything for free, but one would think a car with only 47,000 miles on it should not have this many problems.  So a little assistance would have been nice.  Every time I get in the car to go anywhere I,m afraid of what will happen next.  As soon as we can afford to, we will definitely be trading this car in.   <br><br>
