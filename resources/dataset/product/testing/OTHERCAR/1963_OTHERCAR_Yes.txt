            My family has owned a 2000 Maxima SE for a little over a month now. The car is extremely fun to drive, and transmits everything its four wheels are doing, even in snow.  The Maxima has extremely good acceleration, and handles like some sports cars. Driving this car makes you feel in charge of the road. You point the car and it goes their without question. Driving in the snow was really amazing,the few times the car did slide around, controlling the slide was easy as pie. Also the styling is out of this world. Nissan took a major chance making the Maxima look different than all the other family sedans and it paid off. This car is obvious from any angle, and is definitely a head turner. The leather interior also looks great, and the front seats are extremely comfortable. And to top it off the Bose sound system is top notch, but does lack the subwoofer of the I30.
  The bad side of the car is that the suspension may be too stiff for a family car, as almost all bumps can be felt by passengers. Also, the backseat can fit four people, but anyone too big shouldn't sit in back for too long, because it is slightly cramped. 
  The 2000 Nissan Maxima SE is an excellent sports sedan, and leaves all competition back in the dust<br><br>
