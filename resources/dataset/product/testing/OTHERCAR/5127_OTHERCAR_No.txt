                 With the 3.5 L engine and handling package (wider tires, etc.) this car was a thrill when you put the accelerator to the floor.  However, that was when it was running.  It left us stranded by the side of the road 4 times--the first with only 6,000 miles.  Ruined two family vacations and left my wife broken down on the freeway at night.  Problems with fuel system, cooling, engine block, air conditioning, front end and steering components, transmission and very many more minor problems.  Chrysler response to complaints was, "Tough luck, buddy".  With repairs and depreciation, this car cost me over $5,000 per year to own!
