            I bought this vehicle strictly because of its look, I thought it was a nice, girl car.  Stupid reason, yes, but it really has paid off.  I've had the brand new 1999 Chevy Cavalier since May of 99, and it has just ran beautifully the entire time.  The only thing I hate about the vehicle is that it promotes &quot;non-smoking&quot; which means that it has no ashtray, and no lighter.  So that stinks, but its ideal for people that don't smoke.  The back of the car is pretty roomy, and fits a car seat well.  The radio is great, the heat kicks in quickly, and you have to drive a long way before filling up the gas tank.  This winter we had many frozen roads, but my car locks never froze up once.  The car is front-wheel drive, and I drove it in all the snow that we have just had, and it drove wonderfully.  The anti-lock brakes you kind of have to be careful with on the ice, (of course) but other than the sliding that it sometimes does on the ice (not stopping right away because of it) its a great car.  It drives extremely smooth.  The model that I got doesn't have power windows or power locks, but that's fine, because the car pays off in other areas.  I would suggest this car to anyone really, its got the commodities for a teenager all the way up to an adult.  And this was my first car after driving my parent's Chevy Corsica and Saturn before.  This is by far, a wonderful choice for a car.<br><br>
