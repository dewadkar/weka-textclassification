            I have owned my 1999 3.2 TL since Sept 1999, and I believe it's the best car available for the money.  I paid MSRP for it but got free floor mats and mud guards.  

My main criteria for buying a car was finding one that I could fit in (I'm 6'6"), that had enough comfort features to make a 42-mile one-way commute comfortable, without breaking the bank on gasoline bills.  The TL fits on all counts, although I admit that it took a while to find a comfortable seat position where my head does not scrape the roof.

These are the things I like...

* Great visibility in all directions.  NO blind spots, even in the rearview mirrors, when properly adjusted!

* Rearview mirror can be set to "auto-dim" when the headlights of the cars behind you are too bright.

* VERY quiet ride!  I can go 80 mph (it feels like 55), and still carry on a conversation in a normal voice.  Almost no wind noise whatsoever.

* Engine compartment is still showroom-clean, even after 44K miles!

* Interior still had that "new car" smell for almost a year and a half! 

* The high-end torque curve is incredible.  I've had it up to 105 mph, and still felt it pulling away.

* There is no need for fog-lights with the xenon headlights.  Why include something you don't need?


...and these are the things I wish were different...

* A little more headroom would be nice.

* There is an inordinate amount of nose-dive when you brake heavily.

* During the daylight there is glare on the dashboard controls that prevents you from reading the odometer.

* The rear seat does not fold down.  Only a small pass-thru is provided.

I don't use the SportShift much at all, although it does provide more instant acceleration when you manually downshift in SportShift mode than in regular Automatic mode.  I also did not get the Navigation system - couldn't justify an extra $2,000 for that toy, when I can always go to MapsOnUs.com and get perfect directions if I need them  :)

I hope my comments help somebody.  It is a wonderful car, and I would definitely buy it again (although if I had a preference, I'd go for the 2000 model year, where you add a little more low-end torque, a 5-speed trans, and side-impact airbags for only $420 more on the MSRP).

<b>UPDATE #1</b>:  Just took it to have it serviced after 44K miles.  First service needed other than oil changes.  Got a glowing review from the mechanic - all was clean, original brake pads still had 70% left (after 44K miles!), rotors look fine, no metal shavings in transmission pan.  Still rides like a new car.  

<b>UPDATE #2</b>:  Car got another glowing review at 68K miles from the mechanic.  Only thing needing replacement was the brake pads.  Can you imagine...68K miles out of a single set of brake pads?  Amazing.  The Michelin tires are probably next, but you have to expect that after 72K miles.  I did get a recall notice from Acura in the mail yesterday - ignition switch needs replacing and they will pay for it - although I've not noticed any problems with mine.  

<b>UPDATE #3</b>:  Still a good car but the EGR valve needed replacement at 72K miles.  This was covered by a recall.  A couple other things to note.  1.  The aforementioned Michelins needed replacing at 78K miles.  78K miles was great, I thought, so I replaced them with the same tires (actually the upgraded version).  2.  A rattle started coming from the interior near the sunroof at around 90K miles.  Not a real problem, and the sunroof doesn't leak, but it's enough to be annoying on occasion.  3.  A couple small cracks in the driver's side seat leather now, about ï¿½ inch long.  Possibly my fault from not treating the leather with leather creme like I should.  4.  I had the timing belt replaced at 102K miles (preventive maintenance).  The mechanic that worked on the car (local ASE certified guy with a home-based business) said that my Acura was one of the easiest cars to work on, extremely well engineered, and he was in fact looking to purchase one himself.  I told him he couldn't have mine!
