            We brought our Expo in 1994 when it was 1 year old with about 18K miles on it.  It has been our main car ever since, though we have brought a larger chrysler minivan for longer trips and heavy duty hauling.  The Expo has better gas mileage (~24/34) so we mostly use it for in town driving.

The Expo I've been told is officially a Sports Wagon but it largely defies simple classification.  It has 3 rows of seats, though the last row is somewhat cramped for adults.  The middle and last row of seats can be folded flat for huge cargo storage.  Our Expo has air condition, power everything, roof rack and rear cargo cover.  Even with the back seats up there is still enough room for a reasonable amount of shopping.

Overall the car has been a real trooper, surviving a few minor dings and now has 75K on the clock.  
However recently we have had some major problems.  About 4 months ago the distributor system failed completely and it took 3 weeks to locate a replacement part.  In all about a $600 repair.  This unfortunately however created some other engine problems.  As the engine wasn't firing properly it has resulted in premature valve burn out and who knows what else.  As of now the car is not running and will require about $2000 to get it going again.

I don't think this case is normal but given the rareity of this car you have to be very aware that getting parts can be a real problem.  When we first got it I had a tough time even getting air filters.

More info on Expo line
Between 1986~1992 these cars used to be sold as the Dodge Vista Wagons.  The styling was similar but more boxy.  Even these Vista Wagons are highly sought after.  One feature the Vista Wagons had that the Expo doesn't was on demand 4DW which can come in handy if your hauling say, 190 bricks inside the car (BTW doing so can result in popping a seal on your shock absorbers).

There were a couple different Expo models.  The smaller was a 3 door hatchback that is cute as all get out.  It has a passenger sliding door and rear tail gate.  It can seat 4/5.  We almost got one of these but the larger Expo 4 door appealed more.  The 3 door model had a base 1.6L 4 cyl engine.  The LRV and LRV All-Wheel-Drive, sportier versions, had a 2.4L 4 cyl that was substantially more powerful and an absolute must if you get the automatic.  I test drove all the models and the LRV ADW was the most fun by far.

The smaller 3 door versions were also sold as the Dodge Colt and Eagle Summit and are all identical except for trim.  This is useful to know as it means you can get servicing through a Dodge dealership if need be.

The larger 4 Door Expo wagon (our car) only came with the 2.4L 4 cyl that gives the car a lot of power for its size.  This engine is also the same engine that Dodge used in the base model 4 cyl Caravans and early Dodge Stratus cars of the same era.  Again useful to know for servicing.

In 1994 the car got airbags but I think the last model year was 1995.

We really love this car but are probably going to get rid of it as in its current state the repairs are rapidly approaching more than the car's value.  The nearest equivalent cars we have found in today's (2001) market are the Mazda MPV and the Ford Focus Wagon.  Each has its pros and cons but neither offers everything the Expo has.
