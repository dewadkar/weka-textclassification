            After being involved in a major accident where my beloved car was smashed straight into the junk yard, i quickly entered the market for new car.  However, I was very limited to the amount of money that I could spend. (under $6000).  I felt it was pretty useless to spend my time looking for a $5-6000 car that could actually replace the one that i had.

But never the less i searched and searched for a car within my price range, and for something that would actually look nice for a couple of years at least.  thats when I came across my 1990 Mercury Cougar Bostonian.  I couldn't believe it.  For $5000 I got my car with a white ragtop, moonroof, premium sound, and a chromed strip down the side.  It had no rust that i could see, and only 52,000 miles.  

Since getting my Cougar nearly 6 months ago, I have noticed that there are many qualities about the car that I have grown to feel strongly about.  

The things I do like about my car, is the fact that although I have the smaller of the 2 engines in the car, it still doesn't come close to lacking speed even at highway speeds merging is no problem.  Also, the seats are some of the most comfortable seats I have ever had the pleasure of sitting on.  Even while in the back seat one can be perfectly comfortable with the spacious leg room and padded plush cushons.

the parts of the car that I don't like is the drive.  Unfortunatly, this car, bieng rear wheel drive,  is incredible hard to control in the rain and snow.  Countless times I've nearly lost the car doing less than 20 mph on snow.  Also, I HATE the seatbelts.  On my particular model, the seatbelts are electrical and move from the front to the back of the window making it so that the person never has to play with the shoulder strap while getting in or out of the car.  However, with the shoulder strap on, nearly everyone that has been in my car has forgotten to put their lap belt on.

Obverall I really am happy with my car considering how much I paid for it. I would reccommend it to anyone who needs a different car but only has limited funds to spend.<br><br>
