            Our family purchased this car new in 1991, the first year the Bravadas were available.  First thing that I love:  I've driven several SUV models since then, the Chevy Blazer, Jeep Cherokee, and Kia model, and none of them rides as nicely as the Bravada.  The next thing I love is that this car has really *knock wood* been mostly trouble-free.  The only major repair we've had to undertake so far has been to replace the brake drums (and honestly, I'm not sure that was even required - it may have been a greedy mechanic), although I never noticed a problem with the brakes while driving.  It has over 103000 miles on it now and still runs very well.  

This truck handles very well, the turning radius is incredibly small, allowing for great manuverability.  There is a slight bit of roll on sharp corners, but nothing like some of the other trucks I've driven.  It gets about 20 mpg still (that's all city driving and usually without running A/C) which I think is respectable for an SUV.  

I would highly recommend this car to anyone interested in SUVs.  At least test-drive it.  The leather interior may seem like unnecessary luxury, but we have a baby who's spilled milk and juice several times on the seats and it's a heck of a lot easier to clean off leather than off fabric :)  I love sitting up high when I drive, and I love being able to tote large items (like the dog, or a bicycle) while still managing to carry my family in the car as well.
