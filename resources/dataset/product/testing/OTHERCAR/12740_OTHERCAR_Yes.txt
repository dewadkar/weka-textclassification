            I have 3 children and a service dog and knew I had to have a minivan.
 So I went shopping for one and test drove new and used alike and found a plum purple 1995 Nissan Quest GXE for a great price and it is a fully loaded vehicle.So easy to drive, feels like driving a car and I feel safe in it with the  features it has, and I love the sun roof! I think it is great to have a minivan with a sports car feel to it. I would have loved to bought a new Nissan Quest but money is a little tight so this one is just as good to me I have had it 7 months now and have nothing but oil changes done to it. Not one problem so far and its 5 years old the only thing I didn't like was the cup holders folded out of the passenger seat only held cans so I bought a minivan console for between the two front seats. The back has plenty and even back seat air control. All the seats fold down for loading things and very easy to remove. I have nothing to say bad about the vehicle. So check it out for yourself!
