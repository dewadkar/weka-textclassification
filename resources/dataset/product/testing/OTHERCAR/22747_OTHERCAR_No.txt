            I own a '97 Dodge 3500,4wd,drw with a cummins. I've used this truck for several long trips. I maintain this vehicle on a regular basis. Returning home with this vehicle from a 300 mile trip in Sept. the engine suddenly died. I coasted off to the side of the road. I opened the hood and found nothing unusual. I checked the oil level and found it to be empty. I then looked under the truck and saw oil dripping from the chassis front to rear. In fact 2.5 gals. worth. I called a wrecker from a cell phone. Well, 2 months later I get my truck back with a reconditioned engine. At least it quit dripping oil. This was my first Dodge(I'm 46)and I bought this truck just for that diesel(which cost an extra 4400.00) I thought I would'nt be buying another truck for some time. One would think that one should get more than 25,000 miles on any engine with out any major problems. The truck is going up for sale this summer when Chevy releases its new Izuzu diesel. Sorry Dodge, but I think you suck.<br><br>
