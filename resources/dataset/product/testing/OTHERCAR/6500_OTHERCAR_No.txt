            Overall design is somewhat lacking desire.  The best feature of the design is the lens cover, which automatically opens and closes.
There are two quality settings for pictures, which I liked.
This camera does have 8mb on board memory, which is good, and uses compact flash for upgrading memory.  The thing that is awkward about the slot for compact flash is the removal button is on the bottom of the camera.  To most people this probably does not matter, but I use a card read/writer and so I am constantly taking the card out.  It seems that I am fumbling around trying to get the card out.
I am a seller on online auctions, and getting close up pictures are very important.  The macro option button on this camera is not that easy to get to.  You have to go the menu option then turn on the macro, and then when you are done using the macro, you have to go back the menu option and turn it off again.  I think you have to push button 4 or 5 times just to use this feature.   What a pain.
In general the menu pages are a bit of a hassle.  There are 3 or 4 different menu pages on this camera.  Sometimes I forget where one or another menu options is located.
The worst thing about this camera is the lag time.  It is so slow!  I click the shutter button and two seconds later the picture is taken.  By then my dog is out of range, and I have a picture of his butt.  Not what I was looking for.
The camera is lightweight and I hear some people like that feature, but I did not.  It seemed like I was holding a toy and not a quality digital camera.
My pictures I did developed at 8X10 turned out great.  The color and quality is great, however I do not intend on keeping this camera.
