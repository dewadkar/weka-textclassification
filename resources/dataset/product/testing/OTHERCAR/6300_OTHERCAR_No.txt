            I purchased my FIRST new car! a  HOT-LOOKIN' 1996BRAND NEW  B L A C K Dodge Avenger HOT HOT HOT!! 4CYL MOVED LIKE A 6... 5 SPEED EASY TO MANEUVER- it cornered really well 16&quot; aluminum rims and claw-like tires... made the 1\2 hr each way to work FLY. 
It was all well and fine. For a month. First the paint began to flick off. The dealer told me it was something that I did. Took them to the state (Lemon Law) they opted to pay for HALF) Second, the Ignition system went. Covered under warrantee. Seat coverings pulled apart at the seams. (warrantee) Windshield wipers broke.(warrantee) Rough, Hard ride_warantee- replaced parts of the suspension FOUR times. Head gasket Leak  @ 40,000 miles (my private mechanic told me that there must be a recall- he had seen four- one girl told him she wouldn't be upset if her car disappeared)Ball Joint\gasket cover-52,000 miles (even though there was a recall....they said NOT covered I payed for pass side - the drivers' side going also) Cruise control shuts off by itself.(not covered - couldn't prove it- though when I picked it up after leaving to be checked -only has 8 miles on it) Numerous times brought in for foul odor.Never fixed. Windshield whistled at different speeds.... Rear  chassis creaked and chirped CONSTANTLY. THE WORST part of all of this was that my &quot;friendly Dodge dealer&quot; was anything but....after he got the $$ that is.Your dealer may (I hope ) be better than mine..... 
  
Well, I Got rid of the blasted thing a month ago. 
I drive a Honda now.
Good Luck to you if you buy one....I think You're going to need it. 
PS: My husband's Dodge Ram 4x4 That has had many problems as well.
