              When I purchased this truck new in 1992 I was looking for something more reliable and economical than my older American made 3/4 ton I was replacing.  A small new truck looked far more appealing than an older larger truck for the same price.  For $9000Can. I purchased what was to be the most reliable vehicle I had ever owned.
  The truck was as basic as you could by it.  The seat was a cheap bench that was uncomfortable for longer trips,  and the only thing that could remotely be considered an option were the &quot;racing stripes&quot; that the dealership had installed to make a plain truck sell a little quicker.  The upside to not having power steering, power brakes, air conditioning etc., was not having these things to break down.  
  The only trouble the truck ever had was a direct result of my own stupidity.  While driving down the highway during -30deg. weather at 110km/hour, the crank-case breather froze off causing a pressure build up within the engine.  This caused a small rubber plug on the back of the tappet cover to blow out and subsequently drained the oil from the engine.  I noticed  when the low oil pressure light flashed and shut it down immediately causing no damage to the engine.  Now at this point I had owned the truck for 4.5 years and had actually forgot about the warranty still being effective.(I had never had to think about it before!).  After towing it to my fathers garage for a look, I phoned the Mazda dealer to see what they could do.  They notified me that the warranty was still effective and they would send their tow truck out ASAP to retrieve it!  They then phoned me before noon the next day to apoligise for the &quot;problem&quot; and to tell me that my truck was finished already.  When I went to pick up the truck, they had cleaned all the oil from the engine and the under side of the truck and informed me that there was no charge!  Not like Ford; $100 deductible, $100 warranty transfer fee if you bought it used, yada yada!  Just free, and sorry for the break down! (Kramer Mazda in Calgary Alberta, if your interested).
  I owned this truck for a total of 6 years and 147,000km.  I bought it for $9000, sold it for $6000, had 3 out of four original tires on it when I sold it(1 blow out, the rest were still 40%), and it still had the original brakes(40%).  It was truly cheap to own.
  SIDE NOTES:
  The fuel injection makes a small tick tick noise that is easily confused with valve clatter.
  Timing belt should have been changed at 90km. (The check engine light comes on at about 80000km to let you know this is coming, only you can't know what it means without taking it to the dealer and paying them 50 dollars to tell you, and to reset it.)  That is defineately a stupid feature!
