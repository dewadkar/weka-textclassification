            In buying a car, the modern consumer has more information and high-tech assistance than you can shake a stick at. Unfortunately, in spite of all the banners, search engines, information bases and internet auto locators, the mere act of deciding on which model to buy is harder than ever. Enter the Jetta.
The hype around the Jetta has evolved more by word-of-mouth than by advertising, this is usually (and certainly in this case is) an indication that the car may actually be worth it's asking price (15k - 24k). I found out first hand, that there are many who believe just that.
I decided to shop for several cars: the Accord, Camry, Jetta, Passat,  Maxima, and Hyundai Sonata. Fresh out of a horrible relationship with a Chrysler, I had already ruled-out any "American-Engineered" car. Some may dispute my grouping of these vehicles in the same class, but I used some simple rules based on what I need in a car: Reasonable Price, Leather Interior, V-6 Model, Excellent Fuel Efficiency, Reliability. I test drove each and weighed the performance of each opposed to their price and the Jetta won (Second place was the Hyundai which lost due to unknown reliability).
Next step was actually buying the vehicle which may very well be the most difficult step of the process. Once, someone purchased a Jetta that I was test driving, sight unseen! Next, I found myself in a bidding war! Madness! The dealerships were selling these things faster than I could believe... And for STICKER PRICE!! After much searching and haggling, I finally brought home a shiny new Jetta, and began learning the true nature of the car.
First of all, The car is a pleasure to drive. The stance is similar to that of much more expensive cars. The amenities are un-rivaled: full-size spare, clever interior lighting, ingenious cup-holders, multi-adjustable power moon-roof, flexible control of the power accessories (you can open or close the windows and the moon-roof with a twist of the key in the door), interior lock-able everything (trunk, glove-compartment, fold-down seats), theft deterrent system, and a handy owner's manual. Everything just works so well! 
Then there's the let-downs: persons over 6-feet tall cannot ride comfortably in the back seat, the engine is a little under-powered, the cool two-toned interior shows dirt and dust in no time. So it isn't pure perfection. Ah, but it was so close! 
The bottom line is this: The Jetta is not a performance sedan, or a luxury sedan. It is a good compact car that will last you a long time, and give you the illusion of being pampered (as long as you're sitting in the front seat). I recommend this car to any persons, or young families (ie. with young children) who are considering a bottom of the line Accord or Camry 'cause you get way more for your money. Any person looking at high-end Sentras (they're out there), Corollas, or Altimas, may also consider the Jetta; For a bit more money you sure get a lot more car.

*** ONE YEAR UPDATE ***

As of this month (06/2001) I've had the Jetta for one year. 
I have logged about 20,000 miles and the car is still going strong! I still recommend this car highly, although I wish I had gotten the 1.8T.

I have been washing it weekly with pure water (no soap), and waxing every month with Meguiar's Cleaner Wax and Turtle Wax Paste. The car is still almost perfect. For cleaning the dash area I use Mother's protectant, heavily applied every two weeks. I use Meguiar's Gold Class Leather Conditioner for the Leather seats, steering wheel wrap, and brake handle applied every two weeks as well. For the tires, I use the Turtle Wax Wet Look product weekly. 

Accessories that I've found useful:

*CD player (personal). I've got the Monsoon Sound System which is good enough for me, but won't shake the earth bass-wise. I use my personal CD player plugged into the tape deck to play CDs (rather than buying the 6 disk changer). The personal CD player has a bass-boost pre-amp that gives me plenty of extra bass when I need it.

*Front-End Cover. This is essential, I got the one from VW.

*California Car Duster. Dust your car every morning with this, it really works. You can use it on the interioe but keep it away from the clear plastic dash lens.\

Hope this was helpful...
