            This is the truck that completely changed my opinions on SUVs. Before i thought they were large, cumbersome, and had no place on the road. In comes the 2000 Dodge Durango. Wow, this car...err, i mean truck, is pretty nice. The truck is easy to manuever and has more get-go than any other SUV on the market. So thats what 300 ft-lbs of torque feel like :).

Living in southern florida, we had already decided 4wd would just be a waste of money and make gas mileage even worse. We got the 2wd 5.2L v8, with every option available. The interior is great, very luxurious (this is a truck??). The triple-layer sound deadening makes the ride absolutely quiet, while on the outside the huge v8 gives a very mean growl (yeah, baby!). And this truck isnt all bark, theres more than plenty bite. Did I mention the 300 ft-lbs of torque? I still havent unleashed the beast, but in somewhat spirited runs, it becomes obvious this thing can move!

For those of you who need the extra space, but dont want to leave behind the tire-spinning performance of a sports car, this is the truck. While I havent tested all out acceleration, as the truck is still new and needs time to be broken in, a friend of mine has the same setup as I, and when he punches it, WOW! He is able to get the tires spinning and keep em spinning until hes had enough :). And off the line acceleration may very well put you back in your seat.

This is a truck??
