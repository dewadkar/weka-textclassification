            Up until a few months ago I owned a 1998 Lexus GS300.  When I sold it, the car had 73000 miles and ran like a dream.

First off, let me say that the GS300 is superior.  A person who has driven one will know it in a second.
But, the GS300 is twice the price and expensive to maintain.  My 60k checkup cost 1,400 alone.

The monthly payment for the Sonata is about $250 less than my old payment.  But I wasn't about to sacrifice comfort and styling for a couple of hundred dollars.  For me to purchase the Sonata, it had to be an exceptional value, and it is.

The seats are fairly comfortable, but stiff.  The backseat is just a tad bit cramped for someone standing 5'11".  But overall, I have yet to find more bang for the buck.
I would not have believed that I could spend 11,500 for a 1 year old car and love it.

The ride is quiet, the engine has enough pep to get me on the freeway.  Honestly, the car rides a bit better than my parent's Camry.  
I am impressed with the finish of the seats and doors.  Everything is tight, I can hear no rattles.  

I bought the car at Hertz Sales.  A year ago I was dead-set against buying a rental.  But Hertz has very stringent requirements that cars must meet before they are sold on the lot.  I got all the service records, 4.99% financing,  there was no pressure, plus a 1yr warranty from Hertz.  This is on top of the remaining Hyundai warranty.

IF YOU BUY USED - be aware that the 10yr 100k mile warranty is not transferable.  You will get the standard 6yr, 60k mile warranty.

The car is of good quality, but combined with the price it's an unbeatable deal.
