            The 2000 Volvo S40 is a car for people that love to drive around in style and watch people turn their heads and look.  The S40 is amongst the safest cars ever made.  It has 4 wheel anti-lock disc brakes, daytime running lights and rear fog lights.  The Volvo is also equipped with a Side Impact Protection System or (SIPS).  This system protects the front 2 passengers with airbags at both the chest and head level in the event of a side impact.  
	The S40 is a 4 door Sedan made for passengers and safety.  The S40 goes for around 23,000, which is an amazing price for the car. 
	The S40 is equipped with a 4 cylinder, 1.9 Liter, and a 160 Horsepower Engine.  This car is also very fast and gets off the line fast.  The S40 is also equipped with a turbo gas engine that puts more kick in the car.  If you got the need for speed than this car will satisfy your needs.
	The S40 gets 21 miles per gallon in the city and 28 miles per gallon on the high way.  This car will not burn a hole in your wallet and is very reliable.  This car also seats 5 people and has an amazing 13 cu ft cargo capacity.
	I think that this car is one of the most reliable and safest cars on the market.  This car is one of the best cars on the market and all people should test drive it before they think about driving another car.
