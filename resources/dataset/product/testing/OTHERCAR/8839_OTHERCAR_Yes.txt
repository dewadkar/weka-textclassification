            I had recently purchased a 2000 Honda Accord EX w/ leather, after my 1988 Accord was in a recent car crash.  I considered the Camry as well, but the Camry just didn't have enough features, power, and the price was way to high.  My Accord runs like a dream, it's smooth, and acts like a typical Honda.  This is My 4th Honda That i have owned.  And the Accord is by far the best.  The 4 cyl. is very fuel efficient, and powerful.  You wouldn't think that you're driving a 4 cyl. car.  The price was very reasonable as well (compared to the highly expensive Camry).  The Accord is very comfortable as well as practical, and the list of standard features is amazing.  The seats are soooo comfortable.  MY old Accord didn't face any problems for 12 years, so i didn't want to go to any other car company besides Honda.  And in my opinion the car looks really cool.  Granted that I'm only a teenager, but this car looks awesome.  I am very pleased with the Accord. <br><br>
