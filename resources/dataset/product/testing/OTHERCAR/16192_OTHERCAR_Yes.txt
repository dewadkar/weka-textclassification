            I bought this vehicle because I have a family of 4, and we are a sports playing family.  We had a Jeep Cherokee, but wanted a minivan.  We went car shopping, and found that the Sienna reached far above the other competition.  It yielded GREAT crash tests results, and my wife loved the look of it.  Upon numerous test drives with that and other vehicles, we found that the Sienna was right for us.  It handles great, has wonderful features, and has enough cupholders to keep a whole troop of kids happy.  I love everything about it.  It is considered a minivan, but is quite large, and seats 7.  Our family loves the access to the seats, which can be easily removed when needed for additional space.  I love everything about this vehicle, and having spent numerous weeks trying every one similar to it, I know this one is the best.  I would recommend this vehicle to anyone with a family, or who needs the space in a car, not a truck.  The drive is smooth, with good handling and acceleration.<br><br>
