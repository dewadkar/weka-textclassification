            After many years, many miles, and many dollars spent in repairs, I finally found it time to retire the <i>87 Nissan Pulsar</i> that had gotten me through college and working.  I didn't feel safe in it any more, and with trips and business obligations on the horizon, I decided it was time to buy a reliable, sturdy vehicle to meet my needs.  As we are on a budget, I figured I was looking for a recent model year with low mileage.

     I travel about 40-60 miles per day in mixed highway/city traffic.  We planned to use this vehicle for traveling, so I was seeking an automatic with cruise control.  My wife and I live on top a steep hill that becomes treacherous in the ice and snow, and I occasionally go offroad, so I was looking for a 4 wheel drive vehicle.  Finally, I am a volunteer firefighter/EMT in my community, so I was looking for ample cargo room to carry passengers and gear.

     As I sensed the final death knells of my Pulsar, I needed to move quickly to secure future transportation.  In the previous weeks I did some extensive internet research and talking to owners, and narrowed the field to 3 vehicles:  a <i>Dodge Durango</i>, a <i>Ford Explorer</i>, or a <i>Jeep</i>.  I have driven <i>Durangos</i> twice on extended trips, and liked the roominess and the power of the V8, but felt it was a bit more than I needed, was the most expensive, and had the worst gas mileage of the three.  I test-drove a <i>99 Explorer</i> from a CARMAX.  The vehicle I drove had low mileage, but had a noticeable tire/suspension unevenness, and lacked the pickup and handling of my final choice, a <i>99 Jeep Cherokee Sport</i> in chili pepper red.

<b>Comfort and Cargo:</b>  The Jeep I purchased has cloth seats.  The front seats offer good support and adjust easily.  Excellent field of view.  Power side mirrors.  Leg room is excellent, as is headroom.  Plenty of room for two adults in the rear.  Fold-down rear seat.  Temporary spare mounted upright, driver's side behind passenger seat.  I keep a large sportsbag of gear and a full EMT kit, plus jumper cables and antifreeze, which takes up about 1/3 of the area behind the seat.

 <b>Safety:</b>  ABS brakes, driver and passenger airbags.  Brakes provide a smooth, confident, comfortable stop.  

<b>Controls and Dash:</b> Good, logical layout of controls with no hunting.  Night displays are bright and readable.  Auto-down driver window is very convenient.  Gauges include fuel, speed, tach, oil, temp, and voltage.  There is a combined digital odometer and trip counter.  Cigarette lighter plus a dedicated voltage outlet.  Glove box is a little on the small side.  2 map lights.  Lighted vanity mirrors.  Alarm sounds if you remove keys and leave headlights on.  If headlights are turned off after key is removed from ignition, they will remain lit for approximately 15 seconds.  

<b> Sound System:</b>  Nice rear speaker placement, angled forward from the rear roof.  A decent factory stereo-cassette that I will probably replace in the near future for a CD receiver, possibly a CD/Cassette receiver.  May also replace rear speakers for something with a little more bass response.  

<b>Environmental System:</b>  Fast cooling and heating.  Easy to use 3-knob system.   Defroster on side mirrors.  Rear wiper.  Two-speed front wipers plus adjustable delay.  

<b>Engine:</b>  Inline 4.0 liter V6.  Good, clean layout of the engine.  Outstanding pickup and response with smooth idle.  20 Gallon gas tank.  I have been using mid-grade, and with mixed highway/city driving (about 1/3, 2/3), am getting 14-15 MPG. Pure highway is an outstanding 18-19 MPG. Most of my experience is with 4 cylinder cars, and I am still &quot;getting used to&quot; this more powerful engine with a heartier appetite for fuel, but for a 6 cylinder, it seems to be getting excellent mileage and running very smoothly.

<b>Drivetrain:</b> 2WD, Part-time 4WD HI and LO, Automatic with overdrive. I have noticed that every once in awhile at idle, the 4WD shifting lever slips back a hair and begins to rattle.  A gentle push forward remedies this problem.  The manual advises that you can shift into 4WD at &quot;any legal speed&quot;, but my friend and fellow Jeep owner recommended shifting at about 10 MPH.  

<b>Suspension:</b>  This is one of the few things I was a little disappointed with in the Jeep.  Average road driving feels just a little rougher than I would expect.  At higher speeds, this evens out considerably.  Offroad feels great, almost as if the vehicle prefers to be there.  

<b>Exterior:</b>  This is a used vehicle, so there were a few nicks and scrapes here and there.  However, I have noticed an unusually high number of chips along the high edge of the driver's side door.  This is too high to be bumping into other vehicles, and while I don't know the previous owner's habits or circumstances, it seems like the edge has not worn well.  I will have to get this touched up before it begins to rust.  Also, there is a heavy, flexible cover under the engine to catch fluid runoff.  Several of these plastic snaps or cover grommets were broken or missing, but enough remain to secure it firmly.

<b>Handling, Road, Dry:</b>  Smooth, responsive control.  Good, precise feeling to steering and brakes.  Plenty of peppy acceleration power.

<b>Handling, Road, Wet:</b>  Very stable with no slippage or skidding.  

<b>Handling, Offroad, Dry:</b>  The offroad test I used is a 1.5 mile steep-grade, winding gravel road running behind a landfill.  I drove it one way in 2WD, and the other way in 4WD HI.  4WD HI had good control, even on a steep, banking climb.  Excellent traction control, and more than enough power to pull the heavy grade.  

<b>Handling, Extended Road Trip:</b> Okay, here's a demo for you.  My wife and I loaded up the Jeep for our anniversary vacation.  We left from Baltimore on a Wednesday night and took 95/New Jersey Turnpike to New York City.  This was my first chance to really test the cruise control.  Ride was smooth and comfortable all the way.  Plenty of room for our baggage.  Once in the city, the Jeep sat in a garage until Friday morning.  We hoped to escape the Big Apple before the noontime rush, but as luck would have it, our travel route was detoured and we spent the next hour in heavy traffic on unfamiliar and unfriendly streets.  The Jeep, however, was a trooper, and got us through like a champ.  It handled easily between lanes, and took potholes in stride.  Once we found the entrance du jour for the Lincoln tunnel, we headed down the Garden Staate Parkway to Atlantic City, and Down Ocean Drive to Cape May.  All these highway miles demonstrated the outstanding highway gas mileage of the Jeep.  It engine never got too hot, and the ride was very smooth.  For the last leg on Sunday, we hopped the ferry over to Cape Lewis, and took the 404 to the Bay Bridge back home.  All told, we put about 525 miles on the Jeep, and it took them in stride.  

<b>Options:</b>  My vehicle includes the following features/options:  Cloth seats, power windows, power locks, keyless entry w/ panic, factory stereo/cassette.  In the near future, I will probably add an alarm and possibly some fog lights.

<b>Warranty:</b>  I purchased the vehicle with 21K miles.  The standard warranty runs to 3 Years/36K.  For about $920, I took an extended warranty out to 5 years/75K miles.  I asked my friends about the regular maintenance on their Cherokee Sports.  They both told me the only thing they wear quickly are brakes, but I know they are both HARD on their brakes anyway.
