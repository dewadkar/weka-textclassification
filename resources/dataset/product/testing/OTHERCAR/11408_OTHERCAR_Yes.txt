            The toyota 4 runner gets two thumbs up by me.  It is the perfect family car, the perfect single car, and the perfect adventure car.  It is all in all the best sports utility vehicle on the market.  The great things about toyotas are that they are dependable, they never quit.  The engines are built to last.  The 4 runner can come in many different models.  It can range from $29,000 all the way to the top of the line $40,000.  This car is perfect for the family types that needs to cart kids to and from places.  But, on the weekends you can take this truck and see the world like you have never seen it before.  The 4x4 gives you the opportunity to go camping, hiking, or fishing.  Or it can simply get you to the golf course.  Whatever you needs maybe, buying a 4 runner could ultimately be the best decision you could ever make.<br><br>
