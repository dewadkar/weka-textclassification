            Any foreign enthusiast would agree that the manufacturers at Honda, by far, destroy all competition in the market of new and especially used vehicles. Honda has gained a remarkable reputation in the industry and will remain to have one for a very, very long time. Honda Cars are the lowest depreciation vehicles in their class and delivers outstanding performance, reliability, and overall appearance.

Honda has never been a company that has settles for the minimum standard for their vehicle. With a new safety system for rear riding children installed in the new '2000 models, Honda has the appearance of becoming one of the safest cars in the market as well.

With the new '2000 SI, VTEC technology explodes in their 4-cyclinder engine to produce one of the most responsive systems in the market. Forget about horsepower/torque/max speed, producing the response time this vehicle has is an engineer's dream. When I drove a '2000 Civic, currently being a Sentra owner, I was absolutely amazed at the performance this vehicle delivers. Also being in the business of aftermarket upgrading for increased performance, modifications to this vehicle are vast with some of the greatest results. Even for the average vehicle owner, this car will deliver all your expectations, 100 times fold.

The look of the Civic gives it a more aggressive appearance then those in its class. Built for longevity, no consumer can ever go wrong purchasing any year Civic. If you have the means to spurge a bit, definitely buy a new '2000 Civic. If you�re more conservative, purchase any year used Civic (I prefer between '93 and '98). Overall maintenance on used Civics are very small and inexpensive. Maybe not as inexpensive as any American made vehicle, but still affordable.

The only downside to the Civic is Cabin Room. Unfortunately, most vehicles in the compact/sub-compact class usually lack in this area. Even though it may have limited cabin space, it is still very comfortable for those 12+ hours cruises on the highway.

Any consumer that is in the market of an affordable, reliable vehicle considers a Honda Civic. It�s well worth the time and money for the experience this car will give you.
