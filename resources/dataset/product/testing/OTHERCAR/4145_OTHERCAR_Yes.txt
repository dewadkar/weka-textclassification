            I just love this car.  My husband and I bought one new off of the lot last year and have used this car quite abit.  It is very durable an yet very attractive.

We chose the ZR2 because it was much more sporty, alot better suited for the kind of driving we do in Colorado.  Even though it has a more "outdoorsy" look it still has a nice ride.  It steers wonderfully and can turn on a dime.  We haven't had any problems with winter driving with this vehicle.  

The one complaint that I have about this car is the seats.  They just don't seem to be comfortable for long trips.  Also the car is on the small side for an SUV, especially if you choose the 2 door like we did.  That makes getting into the back seat almost impossible for an adult, definetely not a car to take for driving business clients around.  

We are currently looking to sell our SR2 Blazer because we recently purchased an Avalanche, our "new" favorite car.  Sadly we have found that the Blazer doesn't hold their value nearly as well as other SUVs like the Suburban.  This is another point of the car that I'm not real pleased with.  

Besides those few things that I mentioned I have been pleased with our Blazer.  It is very easy to drive and makes you confident that you can handle any weather while traveling in it.  I would recommend the Blazer, especially the ZR2 for anyone that is shopping for a smaller size SUV, but still wants a good durable car with comfort.  The gas mileage sure beats a Suburban and its still easy on the eyes.  Just don't get this car if you have a large family or long legs because with either you will feel cramped!!
