            The Cadillac Seville is a very impressive car. There are some features that will impress you even before you start it. Everything is powered. Even the headrests! They move up and down with the flip of a switch next to the other seat controls. It has a built-in memory to save seating arrangements for drivers. 
The interior is very nice. There is leather everywhere and the seats are comfortable. The back is a little small for three adults. I had trouble finding my seatbelt with two other adults back there. In fact I didn't use it because the trip was only about five minutes long and I couldn't get to it after about two. The display is very bright, but not blinding to your eyes bright, its just very noticeable. The moving hands are in red, and the rest is white. There is a digital speedometer and an analog, so you can pick which is easier to read. 
This Seville is about two years old (in fact the owners are trading it in for a Deville DTS next year) so I didn't see any OnStar controls. 
The Seville had the Northstar V-8, which is super-powerful. This car really moves. I found that the engine stayed quiet, even when you accelerated fairly hard. The rest of the cabin was quiet and there was very little wind noise. I didn't think that the handling was bad, but it wasn't surprisingly great. The handling was very good though. The car glides over the pot holes. Instead of having a big bump, you feel the car ever-so-slightly lower a little and the come back up after clearing the hole. It felt like gliding over the bump. I think that some people may just not want to feel the bump, but I thought that the Seville handled these bumps and holes very well. 
Overall, I really liked this car. I think that it may get a bad wrap because it is a Cadillac, but it is a sport-sedan. The new Deville is also equipped with the Northstar V-8 and a heads-up night vision display. There is also a new Catera coming out soon, with design resembling the Evoq.
I would also look at this car because it should be a little cheaper and similar in performance. But, I would also look at the Lincoln LS and the Infiniti I30. The LS comes with a V-8 and is much cheaper, and the I30 has a very nice V-6.
