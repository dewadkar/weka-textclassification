            After having hauled my 89' Honda Accord away (the car from hell and no indictment of Honda, just a lemon), I decided to rent a car for a while as I made up my mind to my next car purchase.  I came out of the car rental agency with a 2003 Nissan Sentra GE.  What a dream!
<p>
<b>I'm not a "car" person</b> and don't use my car much as I work at home (thank you Jesus!), but I do need reliable transportation.
<p> I'm the sole care giver of my 91 year old Mom and reliability is a must with me.  Your worse nightmare is having  medical emergencies and not being able to get to the ER because your car decides to play tricks with you. 

<p>For a month or so, while I drove that beautiful Sentra rental, I carefully researched the reviews from several web sites (including, of course, Epinions, my favorite!)

<p>The sights were plentiful and informative: http://www.edmunds.com and http://www.carbuyingtips.com to name just a few.

<p>All my roads kept pointing me to Nissan Sentra. The more I drove the rental, the more focused I became on Sentra.
<p>Then, (after much prayer), I went to http://www.Carmax.com and was taken in with their approach to selling cars (which had been a nightmare to me up to then !).
<p>
<b>I'LL GET TO THE REVIEW ON THE SENTRA IN A MOMENT FOLKS!</b>
<p>At Carmax.Com, gone was the intimidation, the pressure, the constant "cat and mouse" game at which you know you are losing.  Just help in helping you choose the car YOU WANT!
<p>I got on their web site and found 15 Nissan Sentras across their other lots. The one I finally found (in Georgia) had only 2,800 miles on it, no defects, and positively a dream.  A 2002 Sentra GXE.

<p>Sure it was going to cost me $150.00 to have transfered down to Miami but it would be deducted from the sale price if I bought the car and after having checked out all 15 Sentras and their car history at http://www.Carfax.com  (a must folks if you're going to buy a used or new car), it seemed to be the best choice.  

This was not easy as there were plenty of other just as great conditioned cars.
<p>Their salesperson, Mr. Alberto Maradiago was the most helpful, courteous, and informative salesman I have run into in a long time and I encourage all local Miami, Fla. to head towards the International Mall and look him up (although, Carmax probably has a whole lot of other just as nice salespersons).  
<p><b>2002 Nissan Sentra GXE 4D Sedan;</b>
 Silver colored, 2,800 miles. A/C super cold and a must in Miami. Power Steering, locks, mirrors, and windows.  The best sounding am/fm CD systems imaginable (front and back amps.)  Cruise Control (which I'll never use I know) and rear defroster.  1.8L engine 4 cylinders, 2WD.  
<p>In short, a lot more car than what I needed and a No Haggle Price of $12,998.
<p><b>NOW THE REVIEW FOLKS!</b>
<p>
<b>ON HANDLING</b>, great for city or school driving. Smooth hardly can tell the motor is running.  Great manuevering space and comes to a smooth non-jerking stop when brakes applied.
<p>
<b>ON INTERIOR</b> has a lot of really cool extra features.  Several extra compartments to keep all the stuff I'll never use.  Special compartments for glasses; CD's, writing pads, tissue boxes, etc.  More compartments on the spacious dashboard and other compartments in the rear seats.
<p>
<b>SEATING</b>, honestly, for just my Mom and myself and a frequent guest rider, ample leg and head room.  One word however, it fits five, but comfortably only four.  The rear center seat is not for long journeys.  But if you have few passengers, no problem!
<p>
<b>Trunk space</b>for my needs just great.  I have my Mom's wheelchair and I can easily lift it up in the trunk if not in the rear seat.  I can pull out and push in cargo with the fold down seats and not have to pull up and let drop down if you know what I mean.  With a fractured shoulder with 4 screws and two rods in it, this is a must for me personally.
<p>
<b>The Exterior Style</b> - I find just as attractive as the Honda Accord and definitely moreso than the Toyota. At least, that's my opinion.             
<p>
I do hope this review helps some of you out there make a very important decision.  I'm not a techie person at all but I can tell you what I like and what I don't like.
<p>

<b>The Nissan Sentra may not be for everyone</b> but being the third largest selling Japanese car in the world and the most profitable automotive company in Japan...it deserves a drive and a review.  Be Blessed in your car buying experience in whatever you decide!
