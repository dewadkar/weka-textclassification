            Last winter I traded in an unreliable 1994 Suburban for a 2000 Tahoe to take advantage of rebates from a GM card and the loyal GM customer discount offered to previous GM owners.  Knowing what I now know, I would have gladly not used the discounts and purchased a 2000 Ford Expedition instead.

Since it's purchase in January of 2000, I have taken it in for servicing five times for the following reasons:

1.) The engine has a constant knock that the GM mechanics can not fix. Passengers in my car have joked that it has a diesel engine.
2.) The transmission shifts hard and makes very loud noises at startup.
3.) I have been told by GM mechanics that the frequent &quot;cold knock&quot; at startup that lasts for 5 seconds before the engine stalls is normal.
4.) The fuel gauge is a joke.  Better get immediately to the pump when it reads 1/2 full.
5.) The heater is about as good as the fuel gauge.  You can fry eggs with the highest setting and make ice cubes with one click away from the highest setting.
6.) I have not had to use the 4 wheel drive often, but a few times it has made an extremely loud high-pitched grinding noise when a snow-covered roads when in 4WD.
7.) It has been nearly impossible for me to have a seatbelt that was torn when I bought the truck replaced.  

Other than the constant engine knock (which gets extremely annoying) and sometimes rough transmission, the car is extremely comfortable to ride in.  It has a great turning radius that makes it feel much smaller than it is.  However, at the price paid for this car, I would expect it to have a smooth engine and transmission.  I would not like to own it after the warranty expires.  I would only recommend this car to a person who would like to get to know their GM dealer very well; for all others, buy an Expedition.<br><br>
