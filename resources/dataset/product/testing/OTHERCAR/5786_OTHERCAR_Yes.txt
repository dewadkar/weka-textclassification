            I paid $410 for this camera about 2 weeks ago at Buy.com (I used a $20 off coupon that I found on the 'net for that site).  The camera takes great pictures in outdoor light, and reasonably good pictures indoors in  low light situations.  It has a 3x optical zoom, which is better than most other brands in this price class which offer only 2x for the most part.  Another plus is that this camera can use standard AA alkaline batteries in a pinch.  It comes with a set of non-rechargeable Lithium Ion batteries which last longer, but cost alot more to replace.  I recommend getting the Kodak rapid charger/NiMh AA batteries combo for about $40 instead after you have used up the batteries that come with the camera.  
Now for the &quot;buts&quot;: I have found that the flash tends to overpower some close up shots while not providing enough light for subject matter more than a few feet away.  Also annoying is the location of the camera's LCD screen, which is right under the viewfinder.  I suppose its ok if you look through the viewfinder with your right eye, (your face will be to the left of the camera body) but if you use your left eye like me, then you will be constantly leaving &quot;nose&quot; prints on the screen.  I seems like every time I use this thing I have to keep wiping the screen off.  Also disappointing is the smallish 8meg memory card that comes with the camera.  Its simply too small, holding only 16 shots at the default picture quality/compression setting.  You will definitely need to order a 32mb card, which I also got at buy.com for $55.  Then you can take 64 pictures on a card.  Last but not least, this thing only comes with a serial cable to hook up to your computer, which is too slow.  USB is a much faster connection and is available now on many other brands in the price class.  I can't understand why Olympus chose not to include it here.  My advice here is to get the $40 Sandisk USB smartcard reader and forget the serial connection altogether. 
Lastly, the entire case is made with somewhat flimsy plastic, and I question how long the flip open door hiding the memory card will last before it breaks off. I feel like I have to handle it with kid gloves everytime I open it.  Ditto goes for the door that holds the batteries in place.       <br><br>
