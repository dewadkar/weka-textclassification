            My van must have missed Q.C. None of the other reviews sound like this.

The van handles very nicely, although it is a little underpowered with the 4 cylinder engine especially when loaded or going through mountains. It is fine on flat terrain as long as you give yourself a sizable hole in the traffic. It will not accelerate like a sports car. It maneuvers easily and you know exactly where the rear of the van is.  It is nice to drive for long distances and sitting higher increases the visibility as well as makes the leg cramping less. The interior is roomy although the third seat is not for people with long legs. I like being able to take out seats and haul around large objects on occasion. It takes two people to put the seats back in again, but one can get them out. Gas mileage is about the same as for a sedan. The front seat cup holders block the climate controls if you have cups there, but the rest is well laid out. I like the rear wiper and the second sliding door and all the room in the van to stash stuff or people.

There were several new vehicle glitches.  The weather stripping around the doors leaked and we had wind noise and the A/C hissed because of a leaking expansion valve and o-ring.  The parking brake stopped engaging about 30,000 miles. These were fixed at service intervals by the dealer.

The fold back side mirror broke off in cold weather when I adjusted it with one finger the first winter.  I'm not superwoman strong. It was not covered even though the van was less than a year old. Be careful as the plastic is brittle in cold weather

This particular van began to have major problems once it passed 36,000 and the warranty expired. To date, it has been in the shop 16 times costing almost $5,000 and that does not include tires and oil changes.  Most of the problems were with parts not even stocked in the shop. 

The horn stopped working and the airbag light stayed on. The clock spring was defective. Chrysler put out a recall of the clock spring about a year later. 

The engine head had an air bubble in the metal and had to be replaced. The defect did not show up until a thorough non-dealer mechanic did an oil change and noticed that the head gasket seemed to be leaking.  How that part every slipped through Q.C. is beyond me.  It was a very visible flaw. Chrysler did eventually reimburse us for the part, but not the labor. The repair requires disassembly of most everything under the hood. At the same time, the mechanic noticed the water pump going and replaced that. Since everything had to be drained and taken apart, I also got new transmission fluid, new coolant and new belts whether I needed them then or not.

The purge solenoid needed to be replaced.

The front caliper on the brakes got stuck shut an dug up the rotor and the rotors and brake pads had to be replaced.  The rear wheel cylinders leaked brake fluid all over the shoes and drums and that had to be cleaned up and fixed.  It was amazing that the brakes worked so well with all that going on at the same time last winter in snow and ice.

Spark plugs and wires needed to be replaced a little earlier than suggested by the service menu.

The service engine light has been coming on for the past three months with the code of faulty purge solenoid. The dealer replaced it 3 times. He finally got tired of seeing me and replaced the PCM (powertrain control module) which is, I think, the van's "computer". 

 The intermittent windshield wipers quit sometimes.  The dealer replaced the switch, but it still quits and now they do not know which part to throw at it next. They thought maybe it needed a $1000 part. I am still flipping the switch rather than having it repaired.

We contacted Chrysler about all the repairs and they said, "Too bad. It's out of warranty."  To keep the company from going broke, I'd make a short warranty too if I thought I'd have to cover so many repairs.  I thought maybe mine just missed Q.C. and was unusually high in repairs (a lemon?), but by their response, I would guess than it happens more than you'd think from. The research we did before buying this van and the mechanics we talked to told us it was supposed to be dependable.  This one is dependable as repair income for the dealer.

I bought a new vehicle to avoid the repairs that come with an older used model and I am so disappointed. The problems are not design or engineering ones but all quality control.
