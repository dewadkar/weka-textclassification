                 I own a 1991 Honda Accord LX with an automatic transmission, and I would definitely recommend it to everyone.  
     
The biggest plus of this car is its incredible reliability. Mine has 250k miles on it, and it is still going strong with no problems.  The gas mileage is also very good.  In the city, it gets about 20 mpg.  I could not have designed the interior better myself.  Every switch, button, dial, etc. is exactly where it should be.  The seats are comfortable, and there is lots of leg room, especially for a smaller model car.  Visibility is great.   

The car is very nimble and has wonderful maneuverability.  Acceleration is good for city driving.  It takes a while to get up to speed on the highway.  Braking is very good as well, even though they are not anti-lock brakes.    
     
There are only two minor things that I do not like about this car.  Number one is that there is really no good place to put a garage door opener without it sliding around and falling in the floor.  Number two is that there is no arm rest between the front seats.  Of course, both of these are more inconvenient than problematic.
