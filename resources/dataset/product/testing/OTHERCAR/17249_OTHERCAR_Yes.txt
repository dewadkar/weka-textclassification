            OK, this is not a typical car review.  I have a company car, it is a 99 Dodge Intrepid.  I did not order it, someone else did, and I inherited it with about 3,000 miles on it.

But you know what?  I like it.  I like it a lot.  After 10 months it has 30,000 miles on it.  My miles have each been trouble free, and it still rides like a new car.  This is one of the first cars I have had that did not come with the front end hopelessly out of line, necessitating an immediate alignment or rapid replacement of the front tires.

As one can see, I drive a lot.  My company uses only American cars, so a typical complaint is about too-soft seats, which lead to back pain after a long time.  Not so with this one.  The seats are firm, and remain comfortable after hours at highway speeds.  Almost as good as a Passat (are you listening, Daimler-Chrysler?)

You know what else is remarkable?  This car has the best AM reception of ANY car I know, great for the over 40 group who are tired of music and need their dose of talk radio (Don't give me a hard time; this keeps me awake on the road, and there are no repeats.

What would I change?  I would add lumbar support, better A/C, a more sensitive remote trunk lid gizmo (this one is frankly terrible!).

But overall, it is excellent, comfortable, reliable transportation.  I get 30.5 mpg highway, 24 city on regular gas.  And it doesn't look too much like a total old man-mobile (take that, Buick LeSabre!)<br><br>
