            When my husband returned from overseas last year, we looked for a reliable used car for him.  We came upon this Integra.  It was the best purchase we ever made.

This car has so many positive attributes that it is hard to list them all.  The exterior paint is high quality.  After 10 years, the fading was extremely minimal.  It is a great looking vehicle overall.  The inside interior is very durable as well.  

This little car has lots of power.  The automatic still has enough kick to accelerate past other vehicles if needed on the freeway which is a plus on California's roads.  The tape deck/stereo has an awesome sound quality.

The trunk is roomier than many larger vehicles.  The hatchback allows for a WIDE opening and the back seats fold down individually allowing LARGE items to fit.  It is almost like a mini truck!  We fit two 50' rolls of chain link in the back of ours!  

This car is a gem all over.  It has high mileage, but runs great.  We haven't had any problems with it at all.  Its our little energizer bunny car.  10 years old and it just keeps going and going!
