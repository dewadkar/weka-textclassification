            Well here I go, after going to several dealerships looking for a new car, I decided to go back to home to Toyota.  The Celica GT is the car I decided on and I must say I'm glad I did. I opted to save a little and picked up the Celica GT (Fully loaded) with a few extras for around $23k my car came with 17 inch 215 45 tires (wow what a difference in handling!) and the 140 hp 2 cam 16 valve engine.(More than adequate power for zipping around town). Car is a blast to drive, handling is awesome and close ratio 5 speed transmission delivers the power you need.. Car comes with a wealth of standard features (Get yours loaded if you can swing it) 6 spker JBL CD/cassette sound system is great and ergonomics for the car are placed exactly where you need them. Sporty and Sleek looks just add to this little car's appeal. On the con side, the car may be uncomfortable for those 6 ft and over (I'm about 5'9") and cupholder could have been placed in a more convenient location (on center console interferes with shifting). Rear seats are not that great either (unless your 3 feet tall)they do however fold down to reveal a very roomy hatch. With the aero tail in the back, visibility is not that great, but who cares the car looks sooo much cooler with than without it LOL. Lastly, you've got the most important feature of all...TOYOTA QUALITY. I've owned 4 diffrent ones over the past 16 years and none of them have ever dissappointed me. Overall, I would recommend you test drive both the GT and the GTS (Kinda wish I had bought the GTS) and decide for yourself.  I test drove the 2002 beetle turbo S and the Mini Cooper S (Loved them both but still don't trust the euro-trash auto electronics technology, too unreliable.....Happy Motoring !! :)
