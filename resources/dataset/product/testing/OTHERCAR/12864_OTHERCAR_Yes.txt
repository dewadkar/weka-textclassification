            First off, let me set the record straight about this vehicle, since other opinions here are inaccurate.  The J30 <i>does</i> make use of the Nissan 300ZX powerplant, but thanks to a more restrictive intake and exhaust setup (and slightly retarded engine timing compared to the Z), it produces only 210hp --not 222.

Next, there <i>were</i> important changes to the vehicle over the model years, some of which bear more significance to the potential purchaser than others.  First and most importantly is the change made to the timing belt in the 1994 model year (the J30 is the only Infiniti to use a timing belt --the rest use a timing chain, which requires no maintenance or inspections at all).

Not a widely known fact, the timing belt in a 1993 J30 must be changed every 60,000 miles (just like the one in a 300ZX).  However, improvements to the design of the timing belt guides (and to the belt itself) resulted in a better unit in the 1994 model year (and thereafter).  The timing belt in a 1994 Infiniti J30 need only be changed every 90,000 miles.  This is a significant factor when it comes to purchasing a used vehicle, as replacing a timing belt is far from cheap.

Next, heated seats became standard equipment in 1995 (I think it was '95), and the tail lights were redesigned for 1996, resulting in a cleaner look. There were other minor changes, but most are far too technical to go into here.

Now for my opinion...

I <i>LOVE</i> this car.  I tend to go for cars with charachter, and the J simply oozes charachter.  It looks like something Jag might have built (in fact it was inspired by Jaguars from the past), and it has the mechanical guts of one of the world's finest (and most reliable) sports cars.  Especially in Touring trim (i.e. &quot;J30t&quot;), it handles extremely well, given its not inconsiderable mass.  Oh, and like the Z, it's rear-wheel drive! :-)

Inside, this is a very intimate car.  Each seating position is like its own little world.  The driver feels very much a &quot;part of the machine&quot;, and the front passenger has his or her own little private world.  You sit low in this car, just like in a Jag, and this only adds to the intimacy and sportiness of the overall J30 experience.  I love the clean and elegant design of the dash and doors (notice the integrated interior door handles), as well as the design of the console and shifter.  Sporty and elegant at the same time. This car is &quot;timeless and just right&quot;, in my humble opinion.

The J is not without it's shortcomings, however.  My #1 pet peeve is it's tiny trunk.  That sexy, curved rear end comes at the expense of trunk space.  Also, the rear seats are very comfortable, but legroom and headroom is not exactly abundant back there.  Of course, it also uses Premium fuel (92 octane or higher), which costs more.  However, you won't find yourself spending much money on the car otherwise; J30s are historically extremely reliable cars.

If you need a roomy family car, forget the J, and check out the I30 instead.  It's MUCH bigger inside.  On the other hand, if you occasionally need to put people in the back seat (or if you have young children --as opposed to a pair of 6'4&quot; basketball-wielding sons), the J might be perfect for you.

At any rate, the J is a love-it or hate-it design.  Some people love it, and others hate it.  Interestingly, people who like the looks of Jaguars, tend to also love the look of the J.  ...I happen to love it. :-)\

Now if only Infiniti had offered the 300ZX's twin-turbo engine and a 5-speed manual transmission as an option package...  *wink!*

C ya!

PS.  I am thinking about picking up a '94 J30t myself.  No kidding!  :-)<br><br>
