            NOVEMBER 17, 2000 UPDATE

Well, it's 20,000 miles and a year since I bought the truck. It has been a good purchase. I have been to the dealer for regular service (oil change every 4-5000 miles, one tire rotation) and my average cost per visit is around $23. The seat adjusting lever on the drivers side seat broke and the dealer replaced it when I took it in for an oil change. It was fully covered under the warranty.

I still enjoy driving the truck and, with gas prices way up, I am feeling pretty smart with the 2.2 liter engine choice. My only dislikes have to do with choices I made when I got the truck. I decided not to put a bed-liner in and the truck bed is scratched up. I will put one in after the first of the year, but I wish that I'd bought the truck with a liner. Other than a small &quot;ding&quot; in the windshield, that little red truck is doing fine.

If you are considering buying an S-10, I'd recommend that you consider the 2.2 liter engine. It is reliable and does get excellent gas mileage; better than 20 mpg all the time. If you get an automatic transmission you might find that you are under-powered and the mpg will drop.

ORIGINAL REVIEW

I've been driving an ancient Ford Courier that I won in a card game for almost two years. It was dying a slow and increasingly expensive death and it was clear that it was time for a new pickup. I drive my pickup to the office during the week, pull a drift boat around or take it to my duck club on the weekends, haul wood for the house and our trash to the dump from time to time. My wife and I will go cut the Christmas tree and haul it home this week. My needs aren't for a big truck and two wheel drive is fine.

Don't get me wrong, a full sized truck with four-wheel drive and a big V-8 would be nice, but a trip to cars.com suggested that I wasn't going there this year. My insurance rates and the cost of operation also suggest that a look at a smaller truck was in order. I found a new, 1999 Chevy S-10 that has met all my criteria and, so far (2500 miles), I'm quite satisfied.

I remembered all the negative stuff about bad rear main seals in earlier opposed engine configurations and really hadn't ridden in or driven an S-10 for six or seven years. I was pleasantly surprised when I found the right dealer (Lithia Chevrolet in Redding, CA) and they pointed me towards their trucks. 

I drove one full size Chevy that I liked, but after &quot;running the numbers&quot;, it was clear that my thoughts about the affordability of the S-10 were correct. I drove one S-10 that I was not particularly impressed with, that was real inexpensive, but didn't get me very excited. Then I found the red 1999 S-10/ LS that I bought, and that was clearly what I wanted. Bottom line, $13,000 &quot;out the door&quot;.

The truck has the tried and true Chevy 4 cyl 2.2 liter L4 power plant, rated at 29 mpg hwy, 23 mpg in town. It has a 5 speed manual transmission that is very adequate and lets the small engine perform well. It is not the hottest car at the light but performs well and handles mountain roads very admirably. My wife and I made a trip to &quot;the coast&quot;, around 150 miles one way, lots of ups and downs with the mountain tops in excess of 3,000 feet. No problem. The electronic fuel injection works great at these significant altitude changes. The abs system performed well the one time that I had to &quot;climb on the binders&quot;. The truck stopped surprisingly quickly, and in a straight line, just like it's designed to.

The truck came with &quot;sport wheels&quot; and Uniroyal Tiger Paws that give the rig a very stable feel and, on that trip to the coast, delivered a sure and comfortable ride for any vehicle, particularly nice for a small pickup. We have lots of pot holes and worse on our &quot;Country Roads&quot; and the tires and suspension handle them well. The truck is, also, very easy to park. What seems to be very close steering ratio gets the truck in and out of tight spots in town and is doing ï¿½yeoman's duty&quot; during the holiday season in the mall parking lots.

The interior is nicely finished with velour seats, a very nice dash display and a &quot;kick ass&quot; sound system with cd player. The seats themselves are very comfortable with functional, adjustable lumbar support. The cab is quiet and very little road noise is evident while driving. 

The cab has adequate seating for two with an option for a third person, but that would be tight. This is a standard cab. There is very little storage room behind the seats. I can get my duck hunting togs and paraphernalia behind the drivers seat, but the boots go in the bed. A &quot;topper&quot; of some sort is in my near future as space is at a premium in this nice, but small, truck.

I hope that I'm still happy with the truck next year at this time. As I mentioned above, the truck cost me around $13,000. It listed, with the wheels, interior and stereo, a little over $16,000. There was a $2,000 rebate plus around $1,800 in dealer incentives that brought the actual price way down. I applied the rebate to the down payment and added a $500 check and financed $12,500 for the truck. I can live with that.

I know that you know this, but... Look for the rebates and the dealer incentives because these can dramatically impact the price of the vehicle. And don't be afraid to ask the sales staff or the manager for this information. We got a very slick sales pitch from another dealership in Chico and they couldn't, or wouldn't, come close to the deal we got at Lithia Motors in Redding.

If you're in the market for a very reasonably priced truck and you can get by with something the size of an S-10, give it a look. Check all the e sources for reviews and prices and then check them out. I think that I'm lucky to have an honest, reliable dealership here that was willing to listen to me. I hope that I continue to be happy with them, too. The S-10 that I bought is very nice, and it's very red. 

And maybe next year I can get that gold Silverado...naah!!

March 20, 2000 UPDATE

Well, it's still running strong and with gas at $2 a gallon, I'm feeling pretty smug about that 2.2 liter four banger. If I drive at less than 75 (freeway speed limit here is 70) I get pretty close to the advertised 29 mph. But, if I push it the mileage drops way off and I've been as low as 19 mpg on some trips.

I have been in for two factory scheduled services, at 3,500 and 6,500 miles, $23 and $46, as advertised. They rotated the tires this time. I am happy with the truck's performance.

Lithia Motors of Redding, CA, is my dealer. I was left &quot;cooling my heels&quot; for a half an hour or so while some billing paperwork was generated on my second visit. I was crabby about that. Other than that, no problems.

The truck cab is small. I need to get a topper/camper shell and, also, a bed liner. Some trips to the dump, helping two daughters move into new houses and hauling some stock feed have nicked the paint in the truck bed. It happens.

I like my S-10 and consider it a good purchase.
