            I bought my 1999 1.8 GLS second hand with just under 10,000 miles on it, and in two years I've added another 20,000 miles. The only time this car has let me down was when I stupidly left the hazard warning lights on all night. The only reason why I'm going to sell it soon is that I'm moving to a country where we drive on the correct side of the road.

The Tiptronic transmission gives you the best of both worlds of manual and automatic. I have a couple of monor reservations, though. Coming from a manual car it took a little while to get used to the up/down lever action (why don't they put buttons on the steering wheel). Also, living in sometimes snowy Massachusetts, it would be great if the car could move off in 2nd or even 3rd (to lessen the chance of wheel spin) but the gearbox can't do that.

Some say the 1.8 turbo-charged engine is underpowered. However, if you drive the car at high revs (and get the turbo working) there's plenty of power. My car will cruise effortlessly at 100MPH if I let it (the first accessory I bought was a radar detector...) and returns close to 30MPG (and these are undersized American gallons!) on long runs at speed. (The model I was tempted to buy above this is not the 6 cylinder 2.5; if I had had the extra it would have been the 4Motion - an Audi A6 Quattro but with a more pleasing body shape for far fewer dollars.) 

The trunk is roomy - we took a road trip with our toddler and everything fitted in there! (Other parents will know what space eaters kids' stuff can be!)

VW parts are very expensive. I strongly recommend getting an extended warranty, as just one major component failure will more than pay for the cost (that is, if you can't get the dealer to throw in the extended warranty for nothing as part of your bargaining). 

Service costs are made higher by VW recommended practice of replacing brake disks with brake pads - I had one VW dealer do this to me with the front brake pads without letting me see the disks (they'd been mysteriously thrown away when I asked to see them). When another VW dealer tried to do the same with the back brakes, warning me of vibration and noise if I didn't replace the disks with the pads, I asked to see the disks myself and saw they were perfectly serviceable. (It helps that I did almost everything on my own cars, including VWs, for many years when I was broke). There's been no sign of any problems since, not surprisingly.
