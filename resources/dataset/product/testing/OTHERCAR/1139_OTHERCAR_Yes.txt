            I purchased my new 2000 Dodge Neon ES in January, 2000.  I was drawn to it immediately by its color (Patriot Blue Pearlcoat), and its extensive list of factory options (unusual for this model).  The color, incidentally, was a 'late-availability' choice, but is absolutely worth it -- very unique and brilliant!  My car, with a sticker of $17,040, has every feature available except for the ABS/traction control group.  You see, I wanted it ALL if I was going to own this car.  What can I say, but this was somewhat of an emotional purchase, based on my LOVE of its style and unique characteristics that set it apart from the rest in the segment.

I was able to test drive the vehicle for over 1/2 hour, and the dealer was nice enough to let me go it alone to evaluate it.  I was very impressed.  I must say the 2000 models are really a radical step forward from the previous generation (1994-99) Neons.  These cars can now effectively compete against Japanese and Korean manufacturers, whereas before, this was highly questionable.  The previous generation?  Three words -- noise, vibration, and harshness.  Not to mention build quality and reliability was also a bit questionable.  As the years progressed, over 100 changes were made to components, and things improved.  My 2000 model is the best evidence yet that things have not only improved, but dramatically so.  On to the review...

Take a look at a 2000 model Neon.  The style, in my opinion, is excellent.  Completely clear projector headlamps, a nice (but still fake) chrome bar in the center, and integrated foglamps make it seem as though there is a pronounced grin coming from the front end.  All of the now-frameless doors shut with a wonderful quality feel -- not even a hint of shudder, clunk, or tinny feel to it.  Cab-forward design (wheels towards the corners) add a truly panoramic view to driving, and also aid in the ergonomic interior characteristics, which, by the way, were developed by virtual reality.  There is ample space for people in the rear, and the trunk is also very large for a car this size.  And the whole presentation ends with tail lamps that are reminiscent of Nissan's new Maxima (but the Neon was the first one to bring in the trend!).

Performance -- also excellent.  Punch it, and you're off in a flash.  Downshifting to 1st while in 2nd or 3rd gear requires your foot to be almost 3/4 down on the pedal, but it works.  

Features -- white-faced gauges, seat-back map mesh pockets, and 4-Disc in-dash CD changer round out the list.  Hard to find in other similarly equipped cars in the same price range.

Driving Experience -- A generally quiet ride, which is something to be said for a Neon.  Ride quality is also excellent, especially with the 15&quot; rims, not too firm, not too soft.  Again, the panoramic views and cab-forward design are truly unique.

Price -- When you consider the fact that there is always some sort of rebate available (usually $1,000 or above), there is a definite value here.  $17,000 for my Neon is expensive -- but most owners will not need all the options.  However, the ES/LX group is the way to go... better seats, bigger tires, and many other acoutrements make it well worth the extra $.

Who should buy?  Who shouldn't?  People that want a car that is FUN, CUTE, and EXCITING should get it.  Those who want to keep their car for over 5 years or want ULTRA dependability should go get the Honda, Acura, Toyota, or Nissan they've always wanted.

My car has over 5,000 miles on it and I do have a few niggles:

-  When starting the car after it's been sitting for a while, there is a noise coming from somewhere under the hood for the first second after its started.  Almost like a grinding, but it's not coming from the starter.  Possible that it's just the sudden jump in the engine that's causing the mount to make a little noise.
-  There is a water leak in my right rear carpet coming from what I believe to be underneath the car.  I'm having this looked into.  A hint that there was a miss somewhere on the assembly line on something underneath.
-  The automatic transmission's torque converter.  This is where the car passes 40mph in 3rd gear and reduces the rpm speed.  You feel a slight bump when it engages, which is normal.  What's not nice is driving 45-50 mph and going up a hill and feeling as though the rpms can't keep up with the speed of the car.  It's almost as if the computer can't decide whether the torque converter should disengage or re-engage.  There is supposedly a PCM reprogram available.  I'm also having this looked into.
-  The moonroof squeaks a little just before it closes.  Needs a little more lube and I'm sure it'll be fine.

Still, all in all, I am very pleased with my car, and plan to keep it for at least 3-4 years.  Soon the tiny niggles above will be worked out with my first service appointment, and I'll be even more happy.<br><br>
