            I bought my Murano new this past April in CT.  I've owned many cars in my life from sporty to utility.  This has been one of the worst experiences.  But to put it in perspective.  If I had paid about $14,999 for this vehicle, it would be fantastic!!! If I paid $24,999, it would still be a good buy.  But for $34,999, in the price range of Acura, Mitsubishi, and Volvo, I EXPECT more.  

Having said that, my main gripe is the quality of materials and workmanship.  I have had door rattles that the dealer cannot get rid of.  I'm taking it in for the 3rd time.  For some reason, the Nissan folks did not include body side moulding either, so I've already received many dings.  They also require you to spend extra for the cheesy plastic sill cover on the rear hatchback. 

There is also significant torque steering that occurs when you accelerate quickly.  If you took your hands off the wheel, you would lose control.

The CVT transmission is not for everybody.  It's taken me about 6 months to get used to it.  And even now, I can't say that it's a good thing.  Maybe it's because I'm used to the control I have had over shift points with both automatics and manuals in my 25+ years of driving that makes it more difficult to get used to.  But I'm not so sure.

The automatic climate control system needs more design work.  It does unexpected things and doesn't really keep the car comfortable in hot or cold conditions.  I opted to manually override and set it myself.

The 18" wheels look cool, but the low profile makes them subject to bottoming out (when the tire and wheel touch) easily on small bumps.  One day, I can see me cracking a wheel on a chuck hole.

The air intake scoop is on the underside of the engine compartment.  That is the worst place to put the thing.  Imagine going through a low water crossing and having the engine quit due to strangulation.  Can you imagine being in the mud?  It's definitely a street toy.  Dry street toy.

I also can't get comfortable in the car.  I have the leather seats and am 6' tall.  I'm either too high and can't see traffic lights when at a stop or I'm laid too far back and have to stretch to reach the steering wheel.  Not sure what body size the thing was designed for.

There are some good things.  The engine is fast.  I beat a Subaru WRX from a standing stop the other day.  Don't tell the cops...  ;-)  The Bose sound system does rock.  No need to upgrade that part.  It goes really fast on the highway and is a smooth ride.

If you do want one of these, go for the GPS navigation and the suspension control systems.  You'll be glad you did.  Given the weight of the vehicle, it does tend to roll a lot.  And the instrument cluster is really designed for the navigation system.  Buttons seem under used for the entertainment-only option.

When I took my test ride, what made me buy it was the interior design, roominess, and the fast and smooth powertrain.  I should have known that it takes about 1000 miles in the car before you really know if you want it.  But by then it's too late.  Suggest you ask the dealer to let you take one for the weekend before buying.
