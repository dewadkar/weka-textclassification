            This car is dangerous...not dangerous in the sense that 60 Minutes is going to show up at the manufacturer with hidden camera tape, but dangerous in the sense of what it does to a normally rational male adult. Read on...

Our Golf III was a funky emerald green with tan interior, and it sat quite incognito, disguised as a family economy car...until you got behind the wheel.  I couldn't help myself...every shift was at redline...ever corner was at the limit of adhesion...the car begged to be scooted around like a racecar.

Steering was razor sharp (until I wore the tires to shreds) and on center feel was great (even AFTER I shredded aforementioned tires).  Volkswagon offers a four cylinder inline or a VR6, which is a funky, fifteen degree V that places the pistons for all six cylinders under a single head.  My pockets weren't deep enough for the VR6, but the four would pull strong all the way to the top of the tachometer.  On trips, I pulled a LOT of miles in the 5000 rpm range (don't ask.  it's really moving.) and still managed to stay above 30 MPG.  I remember someone asked me what kind of milage I might get at the speed limit, but I really couldn't tell you...:)

The five speed transmission was a joy to shift - anyone who buys the automatic is in denial of man's innate desire to control.  A good three-two downshift was theraputic for me.

Build quality was fine - there was very little wind noise, especially for such an upright car.  The sunroof sealed well, and all door panels fit closely.  The car did have a propensity to blow tail light bulbs...might have been a fluke, but I replaced them both at least four times in 50,000 miles.  Fortunately they're dirt cheap and easily accessed.

The interior held up well with heavy use (two children in car seats).  The sound system was of average quality.  Two bolts under the front seat managed to work themselves loose and provide for a unique rocking sensation under hard braking.  It was near the end of our tenure with the car, so I never bothered to fix it.  My previous-generation Jetta suffered with the same affliction.  The only other gripe was cupholders that would only accept 12 oz cans, and then only half empty because they had to be angled back 45 degrees to be inserted.

The lease arrangement at the time we leased the VW allowed for free maintenance (oil changes, etc) for the first year or 12,000 miles...about a hundred bucks worth of work.  Not enough to swing you one way or the other, but a nice bonus, if you have the time to sit at the dealer.
