            To be honest, I don't currently own a Tiburon... I used to sell them. Working at a Hyundai dealership, this WAS and IS the car I'd own were I buying a small, stylish, superb handling machine. I fell in love with Tiburon the moment I saw it, and upon sitting inside... well, were I a bit smaller... this would be my car.

The car hugs the corners... accelerates nicely... the one I drove (every chance I got) had a surprisingly strong sound system... and for a small to average sized man or woman... would be considered comfortable.

The reason (for me at least) that Tiburon stands head and shoulders above the other small &amp; sexy market is that Hyundai warranty. In 1999 they introduced the 6 year/60,000 bumper to bumper and 6 year/100,000 mile power train warranty. I had heard negative things about Hyundai prior to agreeing to work with a friend at the dealership where he was a manager. This warranty was one of the things that helped me agree. I felt (and still feel) that there is something to a company that is willing to stand behind their product. 

Yes sir... let me dump about 50 lbs. and I'll strongly consider Tiburon as my next vehicle.<br><br>
