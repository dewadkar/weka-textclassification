            I wanted to get a Honda Accord as my first car when I turned 16, but I made the mistake of NOT GETTING ONE.  Therefore, my car was plagued with problems.  When I graduated from high school, I was able to get a new car.  I knew right away what I wanted.  With a price range that didn't include Lexus, BMW, etc., my choice was a brand new Honda Accord.  I love this car.

My Accord LX is a 4 cylinder model, since the V6 is a little pricey.  Unfortunately, the dealership didn't have any 5-speed Accord coupes when I was looking, and being the impatient person that I am, I went with the (still-powerful)automatic.  The first feature of this car is the looks.  The sporty Accord coupe is one of the best looking cars on the market (in my opinion) for under $30,000.  The 2.3L, 150-horsepower VTEC 4-cylinder is also one of the most powerful 4's you can get.  The gas mileage is incredible.  On a sub-$20 fill-up, I easily get over 400 miles.  On my road trip to Baltimore/DC I averaged well over 30 mpg.

Speaking of that trip, it was a definite test of comfortability and space.  Three teenage guys driving over 2000 miles in less than a week is no picnic, but the spaciousness and comfort of my Accord made it tolerable to say the least.  To give an idea of the spaciousness of the back seat, my friends would fight over who DIDN'T have shotgun rather than who did because they enjoyed the extra room of the backseat for lounging/sleeping.  The car had absolutely no problems making the trip, but that is to be expected of any brand new vehicle.

Moving on, the interior of the car has a great design.  The air conditioner and radio controls are easily accessible and everything is in a perfect position.  There are cupholders and storage compartments in both the front and rear of the cockpit.  The trunk is spacious and has a fold-down back seat and an emergency release on the inside.  The six speaker stereo CD player is plenty loud right from the factory and sounds great.

As of yet, I haven't put any aftermarket parts in my car, but I am considering it just to boost the horsepower a little (not that it doesn't already have plenty...). I also want to buy some Honda alloy wheels since the car came with wheels covers.  Overall, this is a great car.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants the sport/luxury car feel on a budget.  Honda makes some of the best automobiles on the road, and I will be sticking with them for quite a while.
