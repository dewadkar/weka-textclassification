            I bought this vehicle because it was reasonably priced and looked good. I enjoy driving it, it handles very well. Everything works great.  I love the entire look and design of it as well.  Just about anybody should buy this vehicle it is very reliable and easy to drive, plus fun.  So far I have put about 13,000 miles on it since I bought it and all I have had to do was to go in and get the oil changed.  If you enjoy sound systems or just making vehicles look just their peak, the S-10 is for you, it is one of the easiest and most popular vehicles to put sound systems in.  They also look very good because they ride just a little lower than other trucks so overall it's just a sweet ride!<br><br>
