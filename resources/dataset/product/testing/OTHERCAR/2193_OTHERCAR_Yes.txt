            I just got a loaded 2004 Appearance Package.  This package get rid of the exterior body chrome and makes those parts (i.e., grill cowl, license frame, bumper inserts) monochromatic with the body paint color, plus it replaces the non-chrome grill vertical "teeth" with chrome and adds the chrome wheel (in lieu of the aluminum alloy).  This makes the car look so much better - it has a classic European look instead of Detroit "tacky".

Performance has been exceptional.  It's <b>NOT</b> a race car, but that isn't why I bought it.  No, it won't beat a Mustang Cobra in a stoplight drag race, but again that's not why I bought it.  With 280 HP, it has more than enough power for quick acceleration when needed.  In fact, at a stoplight I was able to easily dust a BMW 530 and I was able to pull away from a BMW 540i on the highway.

The ride is smooth and firm without being harsh (there's no marshmallow ride in this Lincoln)!  Great for tall drivers (I'm 6'5" and I still have 2 inches of headroom WITH the power moonroof), and plenty of legroom.

HID lights are fantastic (I don't know how I've gotten by without them before).  The navigation system and THX sound system is superb.

The only negatives I'd have to offer is there's no good place to put a cell phone (other than in one of the cup holders), there's no integrated Bluetooth (for the cell phone), and the door pocket is too small for a collapsible umbrella.

I'm enjoying it immensely.
