<TEXT>
            I just purchased a 1994 Isuzu LS with 70,000 miles on it.  I was in need of a new-used ride as my 1988 Camry (<a href='/auto-review-7566-3CD7FDE-37A7BE5A-bd2'>http://www.epinions.com/auto-review-7566-3CD7FDE-37A7BE5A-bd2</a>), was at the point where I either needed to invest a couple of grand in it and ride it into the ground or sell it while it had some value left in it.

I had the rare opportunity to pick up the Trooper from its original owner who I know personally to be someone who takes great care of their cars.  The price was right and with ski season right around the corner, I made the move.

I am definitely an advocate of fuel efficiency and environmental awareness, so I do struggle with driving a car that gets an average of 15 mpg.  However, outside of the poor gas mileage, I thoroughly enjoy the Trooper.

<b>The Ride</b>
You are not going to mistake riding in the Trooper for riding in a BMW, let alone a Camry.  However, I notice little difference between it and the 4Runner or Cherokee.  Where there is a difference is in the exposure to wind and in cornering.  The ride took about 2 weeks to get used to after 4 years in a Camry.  Heavy winds have plenty of flank to plow into and until I became fully comfortable with the performance of the car, I tensed up in extreme conditions.

One complaint with the ride is that you can't do the fine inching up and back when parallel parking that you can in most sedans.  The Trooper tends to lurch forward in 6 inch increments making tight spots difficult.  Outside of trying to park, however, this is not a problem.

<b>Tipping??</b>
The Trooper got a BAD rap a couple years ago when it was reported that they were more likely to tip when performing radical, high speed turning.  While, I would not recommend cornering like you were in Porsche, it would take some serious, concerted effort to lift this car on to 2 wheels.

The previous owner related to me a story about swerving quickly to avoid an accident on the freeway and feeling the car lift slightly and that keeps me cautious.  Additionally, the guy who installed the stereo informed me that he just switched to a 4Runner because he has a new baby and was worried about the possibility, regardless of how miniscule, of tipping.  Personally, I have never heard of a Trooper actually tipping.  I DO NOT worry about tipping and can honestly say that were I to ever have the misfortune to tip over in a car, I would like to do it in a car as solid as the Trooper.

<b>The Engine</b>
The acceleration is not quick unless you floor it.  The 6 cylinder, 3.2 liter, 190 horsepower engine is big and strong but not quick.  However, maintaining speed on an incline is easy.  I find the car to do its best driving at right around 65-70 mph.  Anything less and it feels as though the car is not working at its peak efficiency.  The car can easily go much faster than 70 but you'll be pressing down on the gas.

<b>4 Wheel Drive</b>
It is extremely easy to shift into 4 wheel drive.  No hubs to lock and unlock.  You need to change from a stop, but then it takes all of 10 seconds to shift and go.

<b>Interior</b>
The Trooper has by far the largest interior space of any standard size SUV.  It also sits up higher on the road.  You can see far ahead and the seats position you in a very natural position.  I highly recommend getting a model with the giant moon roof as it is easily twice the standard size.  I have cloth interior and it is very durable and tasteful.  The rear seating space is also much larger than the competition (4Runner, Explorer, Cherokee).

<b>Sound System</b>
The stock sound system of the Trooper is pretty weak.  I opted to throw in an amplifier, CD player and new speakers.  With the new system the sound is fantastic.  However, the distance between the front seats and the rear speakers is large.  Add in a fair amount of engine noise and you realize that it is a tough car to make into an Urban Boom Box, but for my tastes it worked out fine.

<b>Maintenance</b>
I have yet to do anything besides the alignment and oil changes.  I can report back as I hit 80,000 and 90,000 miles.  I imagine that services will not be cheap.  In talking with other Trooper owners I have heard remarkably little in the way of problems.  The consensus seems to be that these Isuzu truck engines are bullet proof and low maintenance.

<b>Overall</b>
As long as you are comfortable with the idea of an SUV, I do highly recommend the Trooper.  Compared to the other SUVs in its class, the Trooper offers more room, unique styling and a lower price.  It may fall a bit short in its handling, but not to any significant degree.<br><br>
