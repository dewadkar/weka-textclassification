            1993 was the first year of the Suburban's new body. If you are thinking about buying a used Suburban of this year and model, there are a few differences from the 1994s and up models.

I bought my 2500 new in 1993 and it is going on 120,000 miles. Six of my friends have since purchased one (1500 models). The interesting thing is that all of us are women. We think of it as a &quot;MomMobile&quot; and it being essential to our sanity. We also think our driving skills are better because the seat sits higher, giving us better road visibility.

I bought the 2500 model at my husband's request so &quot;we can tow the boat to Lake Tahoe&quot;, which we have never done. The 1993, 2500 model has a 454 engine and it is a gas hog. I get nine miles in the city and 11 freeway. In California, they oxygenate the fuel from Nov - Feb and my mileage has dropped as low as seven mpg. At that point I had it in for complete diagnostic tests, but everything checked out okay. Later models have more efficient engines, especially the 1500 model.

The 1993s have Captain front seats, where an armrest on each side of the seat folds down. The later models do not have a fold down armrest on the door side of the seats, instead a small one is molded in the door panel. For someone short like me (5'2&quot;), it is very, very comfortable to have both armrests. While sitting in a friend's Suburban, the door is too far away to rest my arm without leaning.

There are a few little things in almost all of the Suburbans that are annoying, especially in a vehicle so expensive. The interior compartment latches in particular are so cheap and malfunction too early on in the relationship. The cruise control is primitive, and the air-conditioning fan only has low, med and high. A medium low would be nice. The mirrors do not have a defroster and the rear defroster and I have had an ongoing debate on its potency. It has been checked out several times so the fault must be it is just too chinsy.

Having the rear barn doors is so wonderful, especially for women. Getting groceries out of the back would be major a bother if we had to lean over a tailgate. Visibility out of the rear barn doors is not an issue, there are no blind spots anywhere that I have noticed.

I wish I would have gotten a more fuel efficient engine in my Suburban, but overall, I wouldn't trade it for any other type of vehicle.  As long as I have kids living at home, I will have a MomMobile in my garage.<br><br>
