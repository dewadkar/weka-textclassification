            I bought my bright red Firebird on March 31,2003, it had 75,000 miles on it.  I've been obsessed with them since I was 2 years old, so I was thrilled to trade in my Saturn.  Although I wanted a V8, the V6 is pretty fast, could outrun my friend's V6's.  A week after I got, it stalled out on the way home.  The fuel guage indicated that I had 1 quarter tank left!  After a long walk, and spending $5 on a fuel tank, we filled her up and she ran like a dream again!  Apparently the fuel tanks are tapered, so the guage never gets an accurate reading, that got real old the third time it happened.  After my little incident I was still thrilled with the car, however, the alternator and the water pump both went out a few weeks later.  Both were repaired under warranty, then 2 pulleys on the fan belt broke(that was alot of fun).  Since this happened about a week after the warranty expired, it cost $275 to fix!  These problems were all probably due to age, the car runs great when it's working right.  It has T-Tops, power windows, mirrors, and locks.  It came with a cassette player, I'm replacing it but it's a quality one.  I recommend this car for someone with no kids or someone who can afford to have it just for fun.
