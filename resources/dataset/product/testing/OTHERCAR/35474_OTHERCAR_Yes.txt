            I live in a little town in Central Texas. Out here we don't have us a Best Buy or Circuit City. We've got Walmart and Harvey's Mowers. While Harvey thought about handling this fine Sony Camera, he eventually decided not to; which made obtaining it somewhat difficult.

I'm not really a cheapskate, (although there are those who would disagree), I do like value. After the trek to Austin to locate a store that had a selection of digital cameras I looked at all of they had at both Circuit City and at Best Buy. Since I've had Sony Camera Equipment before, and found it easy to use and had good experience with both cameras previously owned, I decided on yet another Sony. And, I picked the DSC 707 because it basically did the same things the more expensive camera did, but it cost less. And just to prove I'm not a cheapskate, I purchased 2 of the 128 mb memory sticks you'll need if you plan on taking more than 5 to 10 pictures per outing. I also bought an extra battery, just in case. The cameras I had before kinda went through batteries in 2 hours.

So, now I've had my new camera for about a year. I still use it plenty and I still like it. Which is a pretty good review from a country boy known to toss the products he don't like back at the people who sold them.

For those of you who not familiar with digital cameras, this one won't be any more difficult to learn to use. It's relatively simple to get the basic functions down. This camera will do some nifty things like: it has night vision that allows you to shoot odd colored photos in low light conditions. The zoom feature is pretty good, although you will likely experience some pixelization if you take really long distance photos. 

The things you won't like about this camera. The accessories are a bit expensive. Memory sticks run about $80 apiece and you'll need at least one. The camera comes with a 16 mb stick and that ain't enough to take pictures of your dogs first trip to the john. I also bought a memory stick reader that will allow you to download photos without hooking a cord to your camera. Another thing you won't like is the inadequate flash in low light at any distance. I don't think this problem is specific to this camera, but I still wish they would find a flash that did a better job. Beyond these minor problems, I think you'll be happy with your choice, if you select this camera.

I wish eopinions would allow us to post photos. I'd sure like to show you the greatest coon hunt of all time or the beauty of a Texas sunset. Alas, I guess there are just some things you'll have to experience for yourself. And if you're lucky enough to bring a Sony camera you'll be able to remember just how beautiful it was for a long long time.
