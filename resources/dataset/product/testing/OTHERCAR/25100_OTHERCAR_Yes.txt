            Chevy/GMC have a possible winner here. Nice power and comfort. This is a first model year so there are bound to be things that aren't right but easily and cheaply fixed maybe some one at Chevy will read this... YA Right!

Will start from the front and work are way back.

<b>Wind noise:</b>  I know it just doesn't seem possible to get an SUV with out some wind noise. They should put these things in wind tunnels with a decibel meter sitting on the drivers seat. At least give us a great stereo.

<b>Seats:</b> The seats are hard and after diving for 2 hours starts hurting your lower back.


<b>Speedometer:</b>  Why put 120 MPH on it when it will only do 108.. Don't tease me. Engine just revs up when you hit 108 or up the governor to 120 :)

<b>Steering:</b>   There seems to be about a quarter of an inch of play there where the car will not move either way.

<b>Cruise control:</b>  The controls are located on the turn signal stick, you have to take your hand off the steering wheel to set this. As to why they used confusing pictures there I don't know, the word CRUISE would be just fine. This should be moved to the steering wheel for safety and convenience.
                                  

<b>Stereo:</b>  Very weak. They should replace it with the Infinity 8 speaker system.

<b>Seat Belts:</b>    They have a tendency to go behind the seat when you take them off. So when you get back in you do a little dance to find the belt. Put a plastic guider their Chevy.

<b>Auto Unlocking:</b>    This could potentially lead to some law suits when ever you put the car in park all the doors unlock, that maybe fine in Mayberry but in LA, CA if you put it in park at a stop to get some thing off the floor or glove compartment next thing you know your a victim.

<b>Tailgate lock:</b>   Good luck to all you LS owners who have to unlock either of the doors to lock the back tailgate. For Christ sake put a lock switch back there like on the Suburban.

Just test drove GMC Envoy and they have a different control layout. Cruise Control and Stereo functions have been moved to the steering wheel as well as a much improved ride with the Air Suspension. If your going for the top model Trailblazer you may want to consider base model Envoy. The reason I mention the Envoy is because they are a shared platform 87% the same.
