            I love my 2000 Camry LE Sedan.  I have had it for about 6 months now and it is the best investment ever.

I paid around $18,000 for my new Camry and it was worth every penny.  This car is loaded, that is why I don't understand how they can not call this a luxury car.  I would much rather have this Camry than any Lexus (even tho they are made by Toyota), Mercedes, or Beemer.  This is my dream car.

I want to tell you about this gem of a car.  I bought the Graphite Grey Pearl and it has grey interior.  I love the color of my car because it is so sleek and sophisticated looking.  The only thing I  do not like is that because of the dark color it does show dirt faster, but my car is always parked in my garage and my darling boyfriend washes it for me.

The car is loaded with luxury items.  I have power windows, locks and seats.  I am a shorty and the seat moves right up for me.  It has a great sound system and a CD player.  I got the 6 CD changer as an upgrade so I can have lots of CD's in my car at once, I love music.  

The car drives great.  The tank is 18 gallons and I get about 23 mpg on the highway.  Much better than my last car.  

I recommend the Camry. It is a hot car and rides and drives nicely. There is lots of room.  My boyfriend is tall and he has plenty of leg room and so do our friends. 

I love this car.

Thanks
