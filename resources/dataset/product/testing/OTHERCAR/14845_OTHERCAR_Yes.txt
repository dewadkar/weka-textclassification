            If you are looking at the 2000 SUVs you really need to take a look at the Bravada.  It is one of only two SUVs that offer automatic dual lumbar support.  Jeep is the other one to offer it as an option.  Everything that you pay extra for on other SUVs is standard on the Bravada.  Jeep was our first choice until we looked at the Bravada.  For the price it is a much better SUV.  If you are worried about the roll over problem with SUVs...the Bravada not only has all wheel drive but it is built a little closer to the ground making it harder to roll over.  It would really be worth your time to check out the Bravada by Oldsmobile if you are looking for a new SUV.  It is almost like a luxury car in SUV form.<br><br>
