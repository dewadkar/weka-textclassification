            I researched five or six different vehicles before deciding on the CRV.  I had a wide selection (from VW Passat, Jetta, Honda Passport and Accord) but decided on the CRV because of it's rave reviews as one of the better SUVs on the road.  My wife was concerned about buying a &quot;truck&quot; because of the size issue, but when she drove the CRV she fell in love with it.  Or did she fall in love with the picnic table.  

Yes, a picnic table.  I have spoken to a number of people about the CRV and the one thing that stands above all other comments is how excited they were that the CRV had a picnic table.  I'm not sure how often we'll use it, but what a great marketing ploy by Honda.

I have to say the ride is great.  It doesn't absorb huge potholes or anything, but it can handle the midsize bumps.  Living in Chicago has its hazards.  I will be honest with you.  I don't have to drive to work.  I work in the City and can take the &quot;El&quot;, but I enjoy driving again.  My wife and I both owned Civics (great car, but no room), so it was time to expand.  I was leary about the passport and all the reviews I read at this site, but I am excited to drive again.  I have only owned the CRV for about a week, but am sure I'll be very satisfied with it and the service I received once again from Honda.  

I'll be taking a ride to Colorado in March.  I'll let you know how it goes...<br><br>
