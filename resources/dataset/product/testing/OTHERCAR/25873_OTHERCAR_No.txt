            I bought my used 1989 Cherokee Limited edition two and one half years ago from an older lady who was scared to drive what she felt was &quot;too much car&quot;. I was elated that the car was in great condition (body and engine)and had very low mileage, was comfortable enough, so I happily paid $10,000 for it. 

About a month later, things began to go wrong. I fully understand that when a vehicle gets to be around ten years old or so, one may expect to replace larger components i.e. exhaust etc.  However, the replacements and repairs for this vehicle were way outside the normal expectation, as my mechanics (Click and Clack of NPR's Car Talk) will attest to. I saw my mechanics at least once a month for things like a new pan hard rod, c.v. joints, radiator, brake lines, the inability to disengage four wheel drive due to transfer case issues, etc. etc. I only drove the car to school and back, 6 miles a day, and to my house in the mountains two hours away one weekend a month. 

Finally, last week while driving on the highway the engine caught fire and the entire car went up in flames. I got out and grabbed my backpack, but I was stunned at how quickly it was engulfed in fire. Since I had picked it up two weeks earlier from the shop, there was no explanation for what could have caused this. I realized after collecting my receipts from the past 30 months that repair for this automobile had exceeded $7000.00. Yup, that reads as seven thousand dollars. 

I would never recommend a Jeep Cherokee to anyone, and my friends who looked on incredulously for two years of ownership for this heap would concur. I have never been so happy to sever a relationship with anything before, and I am relieved to no longer have this albatross around my neck. I am on my bike now, a much more reliable source of transport than the Cherokee. Save yourself the headache...don't buy this car!
By the way, to clear myself of any potential scrutiny for how I drive or maintain a vehicle, I drove a Pontiac Fiero for 12 years, and it sold as a mint condition auto. <br><br>
