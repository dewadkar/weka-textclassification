            Most trucks aren't, you know. They're cars in disguise. They've got low, soft suspensions, as many doors as cylinders, and power to only half as many wheels.

The Tacoma 4x4 TRD V6 is all truck.

One hundred and ninety horsepower. 31 inch tires. 12 inches of clearance. 4 wheel drive. Low range. Stick shift. Locking rear differential. Stiff suspension. A full length bed. Skid plates. This is what a truck should be.

See, the wife and I own 44 acres of land in beautiful Northern Arizona. (There are pictures on our home page if you're really interested.) Besides being a couple of hours from Phoenix, it's fifteen miles from the nearest paved road, at the end of a narrow trail with steep, sharp mountain switchbacks. It's a drive we make regularly, and since we like to explore and camp all over our fair State, it's far from the worst we've encountered. We need a truck. Not a car. Not even a suburban assault vehicle. These aren't the suburbs, and we're not dropping the kids off at school. These are the boonies.

There simply wasn't any other choice. Toyota is the only company still making serious trucks for serious offroading. Oh sure, you can buy other four wheel drives, and other manufacturers offer off road packages, or you can have a truck customized. But you won't find the combination listed above in a stock vehicle. Certainly not with Toyota's famed quality.

And the Tacoma TRD lives up to its specs. On the street, it's plenty lively. The stiff suspension, 190 horse and 220 ft-lbs. of torque are technically meant for hauling heavy loads, but that doesn't mean you can't have a little fun with it. The V6 Tacoma is actually the only 2000 compact truck to make Edmund's list of sport trucks, which requires a sub 9 second 0-60. (For the truly insane, or those who want to tow big boats with their compact truck, Toyota Racing Development offers a supercharger that boosts the 3.4L engine to 260 horse.) But the dirt is where it really shines. Throwing the Tacoma into 4WD feels like letting a penned-up dog out to play. It positively scampers along, more sure-footed than some vehicles are on solid pavement. On a halfway decent dirt road, it's tempting to push the 50mph recommended limit for 4WD. It takes *steep* inclines without a complaint. When the going gets *really* rough, the low-range transfer case and a locking rear differential allow the Tacoma to crawl over or through just about anything. 

We've barged through washes, across ranch trails so rough that it's often better to just blaze your own, and through power line cuts. We go places usually reserved for dirt bikes, 4-wheelers, and Jeeps. But *we* do it with air conditioning and plenty of room for cargo. And we haven't gotten stuck yet. No doubt it will happen eventually, but it won't be the truck's fault.<br><br>
