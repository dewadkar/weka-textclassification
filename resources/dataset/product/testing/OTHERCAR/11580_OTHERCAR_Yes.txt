            WHY?

Since when did off-roading feel like a drive in the park.  First of all safety is a concern and safety is not a worry with the Rodeo.  The braking is amazing.  The new Isuzu Rodeo has disc brakes on rear and front tires.  Unlike other SUV's which only have disc brakes in the rear and drums in the front, the Rodeo provides great braking performances as can be seen by the tests performed by Car and Driver.  The suspension and shocks takes out all the elements of a rough ride in &quot;four-wheeling&quot;.  You can research the info for a Rodeo and see read all the garbage about coil suspensions, shocks.....blah blah blah, but you won't truly understand the smoothness all of that provides until you ride in a Rodeo.  The Rodeo allows the driver to be aggressive off-road while enjoying a comfortable ride on the road.  I have had experiences in my best friends 97 Jeep Cherokee, and his car is very harsh on the road.  Going over speed bumps is not a good experience..  I have also been in Ford Explorers which give such a smooth ride over bumps, but leave a bouncy and nauseating ride for the driver.  The Rodeo finds a balance between the two competitors.  I managed some off-road paths in the sierras of California (around Shaver and Huntington Lake) quite easily, and my friends were sleeping like bears during the winter as I drove back home on the road. The on the fly, one-touch button to convert to 4x4 allows easy access from road to off-road vehicle.  One of the Rodeo's
weaknesses is the power.  Even though I have a 99 Rodeo, 4x4, V6, LS package, the power is a bit lacking.  The initial punch of the gas feels moving, but don't be deceived because the acceleration is no Grand Cherokee or Xterra.  I think Isuzu needs to be introduced to a V8.  The interior room is very spacious.  I am 5'11&quot;, and my brohter who is 6'2&quot; can sit comfortably behind me with his knees barely touching the rear of my seat.  The displays are aesthetically pleasing, and everything is very convenient for the driver and the passengers.  Now, let's talk about money.  The Rodeo is a great car for a great price.  No other sport-utility vehicle by any company can compete with the price of a used Rodeo.  Continue reading to see what I write about buying used.  

WHERE AND HOW?
It is everyone's dream to buy a new car, but with the Rodeo your best bet is to buy used.  Unlike the 4Runners and Land Rovers, the resale value for the Rodeo is not as competive as Toyotas.  My Rodeo new would be around 25k MSRP, but mine was sub 20k after license, tax, registration, everything.  My Rodeo was sub 20k out of the door because it is a 1999 model.  Depending on how much you trust Isuzu, you should also consider the differences in warranty plans.  In 1999, Isuzu had yet to begin their 10 year 100,000 mile warrnty, so my car does not have such an impressive warranty.  If you want the warranty, buy a 2000+ Rodeo, but remember to buy used to save the thousands of dollars.  I had been on the search for a car for weeks, and your best bet is the newspapers.  I tried three different internet car search sites, and all of them did not help me one bit.  Try going to different dealerships, used and new, and check the papers and autobuy magazines weekly or daily if possible.  And remember to test drive.  If buying used, don't forget to check the &quot;title&quot; of the car.  Sometimes, there are some great deals, but the car may be under &quot;salvaged title&quot; or something.  Make sure the title is clean, or the car will not be worth it's value.  Usually, good dealerships only deal with cars under clean title.  

I hope I will be seeing more Rodeo's out there.  <br><br>
