            I wasn't sure I'd like the Saturn L200 when it pulled up to the rental car doorway.  I tend to like smaller cars, but detest small, cheap cars.  This car really grew on me the more I drove it.  Mileage is claimed to be 24 city and 32 highway.  My trip with mostly highway driving (75-80 mph) netted mid-30s.  Great for a car of this size.

Things I Liked
Overall my impression of the car was very positive.  There were several items that stood out.  The controls all worked with a very positive action and weren't sloppy or vague.  With the exception of the power window switches, they were all laid out in a logical arrangement that was easy to get used to.  I liked the ride also as it was firm without being overly harsh.  Handling was also acceptable for a car in this class, as were the brakes.  One of the nicest unexpected extras was the padded door arm rest.  Not padded like you would typically see in cars of this class, it has nice soft pad on the arm rest.  It really gave me a comfortable place to put my elbow for my 6 hour round trip.  Headrests were also unusually comfortable.  The single disc CD player/stereo was better than expected.  It wouldn't satisfy the "megawatt" crowd but it will kick out the bass as much as most parents would tolerate.  The CD player did better than average at handling a CD-R with some errors.  One nice touch is that while the door locks locked automatically when you put the car in gear, they unlock automatically when the key is removed.  Lastly, the fuel filler cover has a nice little hook to hang the cap tether on so that it won't hit on the paint and possibly get gas on the finish.

Things I Didn't Like
My primary gripe is the pedal placement.  Although I have fairly large feet (12 Wide), I kept kicking the brake pedal or the transmission tunnel when actuating the pedals.  In my dress shoes, I only had about a half-inch on each side of my foot when using the gas pedal.  This was especially noticeable, since when I moved my feet around and kicked the brake, it turned off the cruise control.  If I had work boots on, I don't know if I could have driven this vehicle.  Although the seats were fairly comfortable, the bottom cushion was a little too short and wouldn't tilt back to give the bottom of my thighs enough support.  Electric seats would have probably cured this complaint.  For being manual seats though, they had a good range of adjustment (foreward/backward, backrest tilt, up/down height, headrest height).  Getting into the car was a little trickier than you would expect.  The door sill was a little too high and made pulling your foot over it more of a chore than it should have been.  A front wheel drive, unibody car should be better than this.  The placement of the power window switches was strangely put in the center console by the shifter.  When the shifter was in park, all the switches were clearly visible.  However, when the car was in drive, it blocked the front, passenger side switch.  Three last little gripes.  First, the engine sound coming from the 2.2 liter four cylinder was boring at best.  It never got too loud or annoying, but it just sounded generic and uninspiring.  Second, the gas filler cover, although having a good design feature noted above, was the cheapest thing I've seen on a car in years.  It literally felt like it would break off in your hands with little provocation.  Last, the driver side grab handle on the door had some sharp edges that reduced comfort.  I don't think they would cut anyone but they should be trimmed or sanded just in case.

Test Drive Checklist
If you take this car out on a test drive, make sure you cover these things:

Take the biggest shoes/boots you're going to be driving with and make sure you can actuate all the pedals safely with them on.

Be sure that you can reach/find the window switches while keeping your eyes on the road.

Check any grab surfaces for sharp edges.  Make sure the dealer agrees to smooth out any sharp edges before taking delivery.

Get in & out comfortably?

Check the fuel filler cover.  Make sure the warranty covers replacing the cover if it breaks in the warranty period.  It wouldn't also hurt to note this as a negative to the dealer.  There's no excuse for something to be this flimsy on a modern car.
