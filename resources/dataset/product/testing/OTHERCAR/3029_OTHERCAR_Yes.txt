            The 1997 Oldsmobile Achieva is available in several trims. The one that I have experience with is the Acheiva SC with the 2.4 engine (4 cyl.).

The Achieva was never a huge sales success, with most sales going to rental agencies and other fleet services. This explains why the car is no longer being produced. The car had a relatively cheap (when new) price tag combined with the 2 and 4-door layouts, fairly roomy interior and pretty good pep for the small engines available.

The Achieva SC 2-door sedan makes up the sporty model. My feelings about the car are mixed. Mileage is in the high 20s and a tank will run you over 300 miles. The 2.4 4 cyl. engine has pep but it revs nearly to redline to get into it's good power band. I am 6' 3&quot; tall and weigh a good 280, so I'm not a small person and I can fit in the back seat in relative comfort. The driving position is good, with decent leg-room and enough headroom that I don't touch the roof (by about an inch). The bucket seats are supportive and the layout of the controls is pretty good. The stock radio is sufficient and the sound-system is good enough to support aftermarket decks.

The only really poor thing about the interior is the fact that it's kind of chincy. The interior is plasticky and is rather cheap looking and feeling. The covers over the seat belt mounts fall off which just one touch. There is no access to the spacious trunk from the back seat, which is quickly becoming a standard feature on automobiles in this class. The controls for the windshield wipers are on the &quot;right&quot; of the steering wheel, making it a bit odd for those of us with the usual left mounted control. Although, once you get used to it you're good to go.

The car is equipped with two features that drive me nuts. One is DRLs (Day Time Running Lamps) and the other is automatic locks. I don't like DRLs because I feel that I am intelligent enough to judge when to use my lights. It's a personal thing and lots of others like them so that point is kind of mute. The automatic locks drive me nuts. When you put the car in drive the locks automatically engage. They don't unlock until you shut the car off, so if you stop, put the car and park and try to get out you usually find yourself yanking on the door handle with no effect. We have owned this car for two years and have never gotten used to this.

The cheap feel continues under the car. The thing rides like a lumber-truck with it's 14 inch tires and once you poke your head under it you can see why. The metal used to form the suspension is almost as thick as a pop can and the entire undercarriage of the vehicle is very light. This is my main worry about the vehicle. Rust will very quickly eat away at the undercarriage, which will decrease the reliability of the vehicle. So far, the vehicle has resisted rust very well but I don't think it's a car that is going to last a really long time.

One other thing is lack of aftermarket support. It can be a challenge to find simple things like air cleaners, spark plugs and oil filters. Some other problems experienced with this particular automobile include a bad computer (replaced under warranty) and a few minor concerns like lights not working and such.

The owner's manual is rather sparse on critical information like how to change the spark plugs. When I did it I had to guess and just start taking the engine apart. Experience told me it was under the aluminum cover right at the top of the engine but somebody with less experience might not risked that measure.

The paint seems to be good and is pretty tough. Like I mentioned before, the trunk is spacious with a mini-spare hidden in a well. The looks of the automobile is sporty, with sleek lines, a clean front and a non-functional spoiler and other body moulding to make the car a bit sportier.

The cost of insurance of this vehicle is average with a minor hit for it being the &quot;sporty&quot; model. Other trims include a plain two-door and a four door model with available V6. For our 13,500 dollars we got A/C, Tape Deck, Power Locks, Crank Windows, Cruise, Tilt, Cloth Interior, Automatic, Rear Defrost, and some other goodies.

If your looking for a decent car for decent money with a good marque standing behind it I would say go for it. The car has been a reliable automobile with only one major problem (computer). Oldsmobile service is usually good and I would consider buying another Oldsmobile when this one finally outlives it's usefulness.<br><br>
