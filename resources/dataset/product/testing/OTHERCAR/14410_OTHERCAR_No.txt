            I didn't buy this truck.  I inherited it.  I do need a pickup and it is powerful enough, but it always has something wrong with it.  In defense of Chrysler/Dodge, this is a 1990 model with 120k miles, but it's also had a lot of work done to it.  Despite all new belts, everything cleaned, flushed, and fixed, within 4 hours of owning it, it developed a significant coolant leak (although I can't figure out where).  Within another week, the alternator died.  It also has a small transmission leak.  The major components all work well.  The engine, transmission, and 4WD are all healthy.

It drives well enough, is powerful, and has a great suspension (I loaded &gt;800 pounds into  the bed and it didn't lower at all.  This is no sissy compact truck; it is a working truck that just happens to be slightly small.  Due to its age and mileage, its current maintenance needs don't necessarily shine poorly for current Dodge trucks, but back in 1990, Dodge wasn't making the best vehicles around.<br><br>
