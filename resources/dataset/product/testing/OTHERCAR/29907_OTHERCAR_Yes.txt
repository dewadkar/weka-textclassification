            In October of the year 2000, I set out to purchase my first car.  I had $2500, and didn't want to go into debt.  I set out test-driving, and drove a 1993 Plymouth Sundance with mysterious ripples on the sides, a 1990 Nissan Sentra that seemed antiquated, the 1991 Nissan Sentra SE which had been redesigned since the previous model year, and I looked at a 1990 or 1991 Dodge Dynasty.  I never drove the Dynasty because the whole time I was looking at it I was worrying about the 1991 Sentra.  I was in love. 

I paid cash for the Sentra, from the first owner for whom it had also been a first car.  I bought an SE model, with 5-speed transmission, power mirrors, tilt wheel, AC, aftermarket CD/sound, alloy wheels, spoiler, and 162,200 miles.

<b>Engine/Transmission/Suspension/Gas Mileage</b>
The Sentra's 1.6 litre GA16DE engine is perfectly adequate for all around-town travel, and all level and downhill freeway travel.  However, I never could go faster than 65 up a steep freeway grade, and with the AC on it can be sluggish around town.  Fortunately, I had the manual transmission and could always rev to get the performance I wanted.  The engine sounded great right up to redline, which was at 6,750 rpm.  

The manual transmission shifted cleanly, and there's a handbrake if you need to take off uphill.  Without a handbrake that can be very difficult with a stick-shift.  

The suspension was pretty tight, and the car handled well.  I always felt in-control of the car.  Bumps and jolts could be pronounced on dirt roads

The Sentra always got pretty good gas mileage, and would've gotten better if I weren't a leadfoot. :)  It's hard to behave yourself with a light,rev-happy stick shift car.  Around town it averaged about 31-32 mpg, mixed driving got 33-34, highway averaged 37 mpg, and on one car trip I managed 42 mpg on one tank!!  As with any car, using the AC would cause the mileage to drop 1-2 mpg, so winter netted the best.  The Sentra uses regular fuel (minimum 85 octane) and at the time I owned it that was only 95ï¿½ a gallon, so it was VERY cheap to drive.  For one month I had a 60-mile each way commute, put more than 5000 miles on the car, with a full tank every other day it was still affordable.

<b>Interior, Comfort, Styling, Accessories</b>
The interior was quite well put together, especially compared to the 2002 Saturn SL and 2002 Ford Escort I've recently driven.  Yes, there was some hard plastic in the Sentra, but this IS an economy car.  However there were no sharp mold seams as with the Escort and SL, and the pieces fit together much more cleanly.  The interior was also intact after 9 years and 162,200 miles, which says a lot as to its quality.  It did, however, rattle a bit on dirt roads.

The front seats were quite comfortable, considering how long they'd been around, though on long trips backs and bums could become sore.  The back seat is uninhabitable by any creatures other than owls, children under 12, and amputees.  There's really NO legroom.

The styling of the Sentra was early-nineties econobox, but VERY reminiscent of the late-eighties to early-nineties BMW 3-series.  The paint on my car (black) had held up VERY well, surprisingly, and was only damaged due to rocks, scrapes etc., but was not peeling on its own accord.

The Sentra had a number of features that aren't always found on economy cars, even today.  Reclining front seats, power mirrors, a clock on the instrument panel, cupholders, trunk light, etc...  All worked and were very much appreciated.

<b>Reliability, Safety, Durability</b>
I owned my Sentra for one year, and 5 months.  In that time, I replaced the water pump at 182,000 miles, and one half-shaft axle because the CV boot was torn, at about 176,000 miles.  
Because the turn-signal switch on the steering wheel was old, the passenger-side high-beam never worked for me.  The headlight was fine, but no bright.  The subsequent owner replaced this part at a cost of $20.  Additionally, the center bulb (out of 3) on the instrument panel went out.  The two bulbs next to it worked and illuminated the panel just fine, so I left it that way.  This is the "character" I referred to.  Any car 10+ years old will have some weird little things broken that aren't worth the bother of fixing.   
In addition, the Blower Motor Resistor failed, causing the heater fan to only function on speed 4.  Not the end of the world, another $20 and 5 minutes-with-a-screwdriver fix.  Considering the age of the car and the mileage, I was plenty satisfied.  It never left me stranded, and the water pump gave about 2 months warning before I replaced it.  Altogether, I spent under $400 on repairs.

In the realm of safety equipment, the Sentra had seat belts, crumple zones, door reinforcements, and excellent bumpers, and I think that's about it.  Back in 1991 very very few cars had airbags, most of them Chryslers, and I don't believe the Sentra came with airbags until 1995.  I have personally tested out the bumpers, seatbelts and front crumple zones in the Sentra, and they work just fine.  

First was the rear bumper.  About 1-2 months after buying the Sentra, I was stopped at a stop sign (go figure) when rear-ended by a teenage boy looking straight backwards.  He was going 15-20 mph, and the only damage to the car was scratches on the bumper, the passenger-side sun visor fell out (easily popped back in) and the trunk latch had to be adjusted.   His car, a 1989 Hyundai Excel, was totaled with damage to the grille, bumper, headlights, hood, fender, etc.

Then, in February of 2002, at 186,000 miles, I was traveling downhill in a 45mph zone, going about 43 (clutch depressed, riding the brake) when an 85-year old man driving a Chrysler huge-boat-of-some-sort pulled out in front of me and stopped in my lane.  I could not change lanes, as there was a car next to me, and I was on the inside lane.  I slammed on the brakes and went into a skid, hitting his car in the rear drivers-side fender, wheel, and door.  I was going about 25-30 mph at impact.
My Sentra was totaled, but State Farm let me have it back for $50.  It needed a new bumper, driver's side fender, hood, and the radiator was bent but worked.  The frame was bent and needed to be pulled out as well.

My husband and I both had sore necks, but a few weeks of Vicuprofen and Soma (muscle relaxer) and we were all better.

I sold the Sentra to friends of mine, and $750 later, it is in good health and back on the road.  Fortunately they have friends in the auto business so they were able to fix it cheaper than I could've.  That was over a year ago, and I hear my Sentra is now past 200,000 miles.

In closing, thanks to my experience with my Sentra, I bought another Nissan, a 1994 Infiniti G20, another excellent car (but that's another Epinion, isn't it?).

I would like to tell anyone who doesn't know, that if your seatbelts on ANY Nissan or Infiniti stop functioning for ANY reason other than an accident, Nissan will fix them for FREE.  Take the car to the Infiniti dealership if you can though, because they will also WASH the car for you, FREE!!
