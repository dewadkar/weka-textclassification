            We bought the car on Jan 1, 1999 where we had nothing to do and wanted to look at cars. We were looking for a bigger car for our new addition in the family. We knew that we wanted a SUV but didn't know which one. I was familiar with the regular ones like CRV, Rav5, 4runner, etc. But haven't looked in the Benz and Lexus. We first went to the Benz dealer and it was closed. Too bad. 

Then we went next door to a lexus dealer and the rest is history. 

Since the car is gonna be driven by my wife most of the time I was gonna let her decide. The biggest reason she wanted to buy the rx300 was that it was lower. Lower than most the other SUV's. My wife is 5-4 and don't like to climb up and down into the car. She also thinks that this is by far the best looking one she has seen. 

In summary this is what we love about the car:

She loves:
1. easy to get in and out
2. not too big. Still have good visibility and easy to park
3. Tall enough to easily get the car seat in and out
4. Lots of room
5. comfortable sitting in the back. She used to hate sitting in the back of other people's SUV's. She thought that it was too bumpy.
6. CD changer system

she hates:
1. always getting gas. But no choice on that one.
2. not enough seats. (what if we have another kid?? We have 2 already)

He loves:
1. power
2. AWD
3. sound system
4. easy to drive outdoors
5. They wash your car for free anytime!!

He hates:
1. expensive maintenance
2. complex panel, control screen and buttons. Took a while to get used to. 
3. uneven arm rests in the driver seat<br><br>
