            I bought this vehicle because I was sick of looking for people to haul my stuff around when I moved.  When I first drove it I  had no idea I would be that high up. I had driven a car since I've had my licence. But i adjusted and onece that happened I was fine. I have the three door version which is nice but it cut backs on the seats. rather than having the foor seats (2 in the back) on the extended cab, the door takes the place of the seat. There is a storage area inside the door. However if your looking for storage this is not that great. Its difficult to slide anything under the seats but there are places on the back of the seats for things like maps, nothing large can really go in them. The glove compartment is about half the size of a car's. There is an arm rest that opens up which can hold CD's and various things. The ash tray (I don't smoke) is not large enought to stick a candy bar in. Don't get me wrong I like my truck. I hauld a fouton bed and a computer desk but the bed door would not close. If you going to haul stuff get some buggie cords. The area behing the seats is roomy to put things back there (like grociers and things) but cramped for a person. There are plenty of cup holders to go around. The Cd player and radio work well. If i could go back and do it all over again I would have gotton the truck but witha V-6 or higher engine. The 4 cylinder does not seem large enough when I drive around town or to pick up speed in a rush.  <br><br>
