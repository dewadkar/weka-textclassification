            Purchasing the 1998 Chevrolet Venture was the best vehicle decision we have made thus far.  We have 2 children full time and 5 occasionally so to travel anywhere without using a bus was impossible until we purchased the Chevrolet Venture.  We got the extended wheel base, automatic fourth door (a must in my opinion) and captain's chairs all around.  The vehicle also comes with rear temperature controls and audio too so that the kids can listen to something different then us on those long trips!  All of the seats fold down or are easily removed from the vehicle if you need extra transporting capabilities.  Oh, and of course, there are many cup holders so that everyone can have there own!

I look forward to upgrading to a 2000 Venture in the near future as I am interested in the TV/VCR combo to entertain people on those long trips.<br><br>
