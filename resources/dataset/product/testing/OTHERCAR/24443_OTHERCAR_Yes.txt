            Over the reviews have been good on here, but just read one that didn't recommend it.  Allow me to offer some clarification and my two cents.  If you are a very serious photographer so likes to adjust everything manually to your specifications, then maybe the cameras pre-programmed options won't give you the control you want.  Sure, I've done photography and developing like that myself... and does this camera satisfy me?  Yes, it does.  While it won't give you quite the control a professional photographer with a $2000 non-digital camera craves, let's face it, it does does a darn good job anyway.  You can read all its features elsewhere -- I won't bore you, but basically 2.1 megapixels is good enough for me.  It takes a good clear photo larger than my computer screen.  I don't even use that much resolution and would rarely need it up that high.  The controls on it are easy in an on-screen menu format, and anyone can use it.  The screen itself is nice... good clear, bright, 2" LCD that pivots to different positions.  Some digital cameras I've seen seem to have a lag on the screen... as in, you move the camera and it takes a few seconds for the screen's image to catch up with what you're pointing at.  That is not the case with this camera.  The movie mode works well on it too.... it won't take very long or full screen movies, but you can get little clips here and there with sound.  It's a fun little feature.  Comes with all sorts of options for flash, self-timer, photo effects (b/w, solarize, negative art, etc), and had no problem taking photos in low light in night mode (as long as you hold it still -- like any other camera it reduces the appature speed to take in more light).  It's a nice looking camera and the battery life is great... i've only had to charge it a few times and it always tells you how much running time you have left in its various modes.  The memory stick is a nice option too.  Easily upgradable, and 4MB will do for someone who just wants to take a few snapshots here and there.  You can get over 50 640x480 shots on a 4MB card, but significantly less of larger resolutions.  But using the usb cable it's quick and easy to load photos to your computer (creates a removable drive so you can just drag all photos over to another folder in your computer).  At any rate... it's a great little camera and fun to use.  For 95% of its audience it will do the job perfectly well for them.  The other 5% may be looking for a more expensive camera.  I got my camera for $300 on eBay, so at that price, it's a really great deal.  Check it out -- I feel that you will be pleased.
