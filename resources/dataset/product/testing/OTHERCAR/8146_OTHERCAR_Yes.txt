            I purchased the Polaroid PDC 300 a little over a year ago after looking at several higher priced cameras. I bought it based on price, ease of use, and based on the fact that it could store up to 64 images without my having to purchase extra memory for the camera(it has 8mgs of memory).

 Being a beginner I had a difficult time with the Photomax program..since there was no booklet explaining how to use it and there was no actual help available other than being told to use the &quot;Help&quot; file on the software. The website offered no real advice other than to use the help file..and tech support finally after several calls from myself and finally enlisting the aid of a very helpful Microsoft Tech support person was I able to pin the Polaroid person down to more specific help. It took 3 weeks from buying, to finally be able to enhance and print the photos I had shot. 
For general use it is a decent camera &amp; once you learn to use the software it is a cakewalk. It is good for taking pictures of my family to share with friends and family on the net. However for photographing things to put on E-bay it has not been the best choice. For shooting photo's of glass (which is not an easy thing at best)I have a difficult time getting detailed photos without alot of glare. This may be due to my inexperience, however my old 35mm seems to have no problem with this.

 I love being able to download directly to the computer, and I like not having to spend money and wait for developing photos..and having the opportunity to reshoot in many cases. The AC adapter is great to have since it eats batteries rather quickly, and curiously will only use Energizer batteries..Duracell will work..hmmm (faster if you preview every photo or use the flash every time). I also like being able to shoot photos directly from the computer and immediately decide whether it's a keeper. 

The only thing about the software I don't like (or maybe haven't figured out yet) is being unable to do much with the graininess of the photos. Other than that they seem to have come up with a pretty good product for beginners. Professionals probably would not be happy with it..but beginners will be delighted. <br><br>
