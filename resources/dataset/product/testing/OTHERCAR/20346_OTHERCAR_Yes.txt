                   I have to give merit to all points made in the past posts. The sunbird seems to be GM's fancier version of the K-cars. It's reliable, but nicer to look at and a better drive. 
  
I have 145000 Km's on my '91 and no major problems. I bought it used 2 years ago and the only things I've had to replace were the alternator and the cad. converter (Part of the exhaust), both of which would go in any used car. 

The engine is cramped to work in though, an oil change can even be difficult with the filter up behind the left wheel. The parts are very common and low-priced so it's not a big deal if something needs to be replaced. 

But for a small 2L 4 banger in a car this size it has some nice power. Over-all I have put about $1000 into regular maintenance and parts since I bought it, winter tires, tune-ups, etc.. 

I'd highly recommend this car for someone looking for a good used car without any major maintaining.  The ashtray is more of a decoration though, I prefer to use my window since I always miss that puny thing.<br><br>
