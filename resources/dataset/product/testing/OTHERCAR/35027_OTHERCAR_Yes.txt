            To my mind, a camera should be a tool, not a participant. I love this camera, because it does whatever you tell it to do, and doesn't frustrate you with a lot of "smart" features. I had a 35mm camera once with "autofocus"-- so-called "point-and-shoot," and it drove me crazy, because half the time, it didn't focus on what I actually wanted in the picture.

This camera gives the user total control of light, aperture and zoom. In addition, because there's no film involved, you can shoot day or night without having to worry about the speed of you film. And by the way, it takes great twilight and night pictures!

All the adjustments are two handed, so it's like liquid; you don't have to adjust and check, adjust and check, go back and adjust again, etc. It's a quicker way to what you want.

Now I'll admit that's a personal preference; it's like stick shift vs. automatic-- some people are passionate about one or the other. Some people love point-and-shoot. If you're one, then this probably isn't the camera for you.

The camera has 5 megapixel resolution, which means that you can print poster size reproductions of your shots, or crop tiny portions, enlarge then, and have them look really good. This is a photoshop type of camera, a camera for someone who likes to play with images.

There are a few drawbacks:

It takes almost a minute for the picture to store, so if you want to take photojournalistic shots, like athletes in action, hitting the shutter as fast as you can move your finger, this isn't the right camera. 

Also, as with just about any computer tool, you have to buy accessories. It comes with two alkaline batteries, which struck me as strange, because I didn't think that could be sufficient, but I thought "Hey, if the manufacture includes them...." I was right the first time. Fortunately, I already had some NiMH rechargeables, and they last for 60-70 shots. There's an adapter for indoor use as well, although I don't have one. You're going to want to buy an additional memory card too. I got the Viking 128 meg CF, and I like it.

Because of the high resolution, e-mailing or posting images takes a long time, and people who receive them will have a long wait on the download. Of course you can always print the image, and then scan it in, which is what I've done. Believe it or not, the scanned images from this camera actually look better than scanned actual photographs. This is probably because I've played with them, and gotten them to look good on screen before I've printed them. I've also used the highest quality photo-finish paper I could find.

I'm very happy with this camera. A camera is an individual thing, though. Before you buy, think through exactly what you want, and buy the camera that suits you. If you want outdoor nature shots and architectural shots at all times of day and night, portrait shots, and candid shots, and want to print them as album photos, and want to be able to crop, adjust color, and cut and paste, this is a great camera.
