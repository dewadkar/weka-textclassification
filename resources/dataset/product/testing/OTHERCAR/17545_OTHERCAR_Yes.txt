            I bought my 1991 Jeep Wrangler about two months ago as my first car. As testimony to how much I love driving the vehicle I have put over 2700 miles on it since I got it. The Wrangler had 87000 miles on it when I bought it, and everything on it was original factory equipment, from the sound system to the upholstery. It came with a hard top and a soft top, but the soft top was almost ten years old, thus I had to buy a new one. Canvas will not last for 10 years even under the best care so I bought a Supertop soft top with all the equipment for 450 dollars. I stored the hard top because I live in North Carolina where it would be a crime to not drive around without the top on, thus the soft top. 

Okay, now for the more nitty gritty stuff. I had to replace the muffler and tailpipe because the previous owner backed into a curb or something and destroyed them, but that wasn't a problem. The real problem was that the rear distributor went bad on me after driving about 1000 miles. The only reason I can think for this happening is that it was fairly worn and since I abused the Wrangler a fair amount the distributor fell apart. However, I could still drive the Jeep, it just made a ton of noise. Thus, if your Jeep is making a LOT of noise, as in you can just barely hear the engine and have to crank the stereo way up, and the noise sounds like it is coming from right below your seat, get ready for some expensive repairs. My best advice is to find a mechanic that will take it for a FREE test drive to see if he comes to some sort of definite conclusion. The repairs, if it is the rear distributor will cost about 1000 dollars.<br><br>
