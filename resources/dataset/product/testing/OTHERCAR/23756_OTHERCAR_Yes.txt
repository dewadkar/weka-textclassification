            Having owed a 1989 Dodge Cummins Diesel for about 8 years and being satisfied with the performance it gave, when we decided to buy a later model truck, the Dodge Cummins Diesel was our first choice.

Since my husband was not interested in an automatic transmission, it took several weeks to locate a used truck with the manual transmission he wanted.  We finally found a 1997 Dodge Pickup Truck with a 5.9L Intercooled Turbo Cummins Diesel Engine with a 5 Speed HD Manual Transmission and an extended cab.  With two grandsons, the extended cab was a plus for us, allowing room to take them with us on short vacations.

The truck came with the SLT Advantage Package which included power windows and door locks, speed control and tilt steering, light group and overhead console, along with other features which adds to the the appeal of the truck.

It also came with the Trailer Tow Group which includes a tachometer, Class IV trailer hitch receiver, HD flashers, adapter plug, along with the Heavy Duty Service Group - 136 Amp Alt/750 Amp Battery and HD Engine Cooling. 

The front seat has a 40/20/40 split reclining bench seat with deluxe cloth. I have had back surgery and find the ride is a very comfortable one. The driver and passenger seat tip and slide for rear seat access. The rear seat has deluxe cloth covering. The seat folds up to allow for extra cargo space.

We pull a 25-foot trailer, and though that is not a real large trailer, the diesel engine pulls it with ease even on the hills. 

We have had our truck for about three years and have never had it in the shop for repairs. We have an unheated garage and have never had a problem with the truck starting during the winter months.

We have no complaints about the mileage, it averages over 20 miles per gallon empty and we have gotten 16 plus miles per gallon pulling our trailer. 

On the negative side, our fuel gauge recently quit working. We have read that this is a common problem with the Dodge and they have yet to issue a recall for that. Although this has not been a problem with our truck, some owners with the manual transmission have had the nut in 5th gear to come off. 

We have been very happy with the Dodge Diesel and would recommend it to anyone who pulls a trailer or just enjoys having a good Diesel truck.<br><br>
