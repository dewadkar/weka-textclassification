                   We�ve all seen the commercials.  They come on during one of your favorite prime time shows, or when the game is on, always there to bother during the pause for station identification.  The commercial were you see Paul Hogan dressed in full crocodile Dundee gear, off-roading in a Subaru.  Although many of these commercials fail to grab our attention, Subaru will have no problem selling their new Impreza WRX.  This is because, Subaru (the Company which made Family off-roading possible) is finally bringing there Impreza WRX to our shores.  Now, I know what your all thinking, �We got all the sport we need in the Impreza RS�.  However, this Impreza is better in so many ways.

	Of the many body changes, the lights are the most radical.  The WRX comes with two �Dodge Neon� styled Xenon headlights.  And, as if that wasn�t enough light, the car comes equipped with two Xenon fog lights.  Other body changes include a longer and wider body and lowered ground clearance for better handling.  In addition, the WRX comes with 16-inch aluminum rims, wider tires and a cleverly mounted scoop on the hood (similar to one mounted on the RS).  To accompany this, the WRX comes with a totally remodeled cabin.  The new interior includes a completely redesigned instrument panel, a CD eight-speaker system, sport seats, and automatic tinted windows.  

	Under the hood, the American version comes equipped with 220 Bhp.  Although it may seem weak compared to the 276 Bhp offered in Japan, it is enough to push this sporty sedan from 0-60 in 6.87 seconds.  The WRX will first be available with a 5-Speed or automatic transmission (with the Sport Shift System available early 2002).  Also, included is the 4-wd available on most Subaru�s.   The 2002 model year will be available in February or March on American soil.  The price has not been decided, however the sedan will cost well under 31,000.  

	All of this said, this Subaru is a great sports sedan and is a great addition to the American car repertoire.  This is one car Subaru will not need Paul Hogan to sell.
