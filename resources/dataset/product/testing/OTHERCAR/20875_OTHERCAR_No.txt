            First off let me say that I didn't BUY this vehicle.  When my husband and I went to look at the PT Cruiser we were told that there was a long waiting list.  Frankly the salesman didn't even want to take our name and offer to give us a call when the cars came in.  Needless to say that was part of the turn off about this vehicle.

The fact is that I own one of the New VW Beetles and thought that a PT Cruiser for my husband would put us totally into the retro mode.  

Recently I was at the Circle Center Mall in Downtown Indianapolis and Chrysler had a PT Cruiser on display.  The doors were open so I went and sat down in the car.  

Let me say that with the possible exception of a Rolls Royce (which I've only dreamed of setting in), I have never sat on such fine leather/or imatation leather, as was in that car!  Wow!  The feel was finer than calfskin gloves.  

The control panel seemed to be in a nice arrangement, too.

The size of this vehicle reminds me of the two Mitsubishi Expos that I owned.  The interior is bigger than a car and smaller than a minivan or suv.  The down side to the size aspect is that it is still a four person car with minimal storage area which would equate to a trunk.

For the person who wants the oos and ahs over their car like I often get with my Bettle they maybe disappointed because this is not the most practical mainstay vehicle that the VW is.

I'm pleased to see the design expressions of Chrysler, but overall practicality even in showmanship is not working too great for them right now.  The average American consumer still wants a standard vehicle that gets great gas mileage and looks somewhat &quot;normal&quot; with four doors, a reasonable trunk and not excessive flash.

This car is for those who want some pizzaz in their life and don't mind dumping $20+k for all the bells and whistles that the dealer tags on.  

I wouldn't recommend this for a family, even the kids will get board with the funky style.<br><br>
