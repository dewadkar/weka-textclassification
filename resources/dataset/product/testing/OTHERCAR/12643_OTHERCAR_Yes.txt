            I purchased this camera as a supplement to my NIKON N80 SLR. I was pleasantly surprised with how good this camera was! It has so many features! It can make 360 degree pictures, go up to 2.1 Mega pixels, and can have an IBM Microdrive (read my review on the 340 MB version). The whole package is in such a small metal body - virtually indestructible. I dropped it from about arm's height accidentally and it kept on ticking! My only complaint is that its battery life is O.K. with a lithium battery. You really need the NB-5H rechargeable battery. Otherwise it's the best camera out there!
