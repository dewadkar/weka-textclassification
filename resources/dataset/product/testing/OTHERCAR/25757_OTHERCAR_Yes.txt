            This is by far the best Volkswagen car ever produced. The new VW Bug is: peppy, smooth, cute, and the best attention getter you can buy. The 2.0-liter gas powered engine produces great highway passing power and awesome mileage I can average about 32 miles per gallon on the highway. The front seats are extremely comfortable and the ride is smooth and quiet. It is a ride that you would expect from a $30,000 vehicle. Just this past week I had the chance to drive it in the snow and the front wheel drive works wonders. If youï¿½re in the market for a compact car that has good gas mileage, and you are looking for some attention this is the car to get. I highly recommend this car to anyone! NOW GO AND BUY IT! :O)<br><br>
