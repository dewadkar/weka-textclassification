            I recently purchased a 2002 Tacoma PreRunner Xtra Cab with the following options:  SR5, V6, Auto tranny, Sportside bed, Rhino bed liner, Power everything, Factory keyless entry and alarm, color-keyed in Impulse Pearl Red, etc, etc...  The best thing about this find was low mileage.  Only 8900!

I spent two full days driving vehicle after vehicle and they left me wanting more.  I finally drove a 02 Dodge Ram Quad Cab with the 4.7 V8 and found myself happy and almost signing the dotted line.  I decided to do a little more research and found that the resale value on those trucks was terrible.  Enter the Tacoma.  I have always loved Toyotas for the innovative designs (save the Tundra) and their reliability.  My old 83 Celica GTS is still running with 278,000 miles on it - WITH NO ENGINE WORK!!!  So why not give Toyota another shot?

I test drove the 4 door PreRunner and the XtraCab PreRunner.  I fell in love with both.  I decided for the Xtra cab over the 4 door because the 4 door had 29,000 miles on it.  There was only about $800 difference in both used models.  

EXTERIOR:
I have only seen 1 other Sportside Tacoma in the wild.  And one other on a lot.  When I saw this one, I knew I would have something a little different.  I like the color-keyed look over the chrome.  The sleek design tremendously cuts down on wind/road noise.  It is a very quite ride.  16" wheels provides a solid platform for your truck to perfrom on.  Definately opt for these.

DRIVABILITY:
The truck is a breeze to drive.  It handles like a dream and will turn on a dime.  Very responsive to changing road conditions and while the ride can be rough on a bad road, the Tacoma takes harshness out of it.  The 190 hp V6 could be a little stouter.  I am pleased with the acceleration and the cruise will keep you right at your desired speed hills or no.  The brakes on my truck are very touchy.  I traded my Jeep Grand with 161,500 miles and it felt sometimes like stopping a Mac truck in that ride.  

INTERIOR:
Very cozy cabin with all knobs and buttons within easy grasp.  I am 5'10 and the radio is a little far away but nothing too terrible.  Very easy to read guages white backing with an orange glow at night.  Single disc and cassette player also glows orange instead of the typical green.  Lots of neat little storage places and very well designed cup holders.  Important for commuters.  Comfortable seats allowing for plenty of front passenger leg room.  The case is not the same in the back.  Most adults will have to cross their legs over in the back unless the passenger seat is fairly forward and they sit behind them.  Rear sliding window and flip out back windows provide EXCELLENT circulation with very little wind noise.  Quite impressive.

CONCLUSION:
I recommend this truck 10 times over.  Be sure to shop around.  I also recommend you looking for this truck in a metropolitan area with several to choose from.  Drive them all.  Resale is high on these trucks so look for the best bargin you can.  I found a dealer willing to sell $150 over his purchase price and pay sales tax (not financed) because the truck had been on the lot for over 35 days.  Be patient!!  

You can't go wrong with Toyota and if you need a light truck to do light work and get you from point A to point B in style and safety, consider the Tacoma.  The title of this review says it all.

If you get one - email me!  I want to know how it came out for you!!






UPDATE:
ADDITIONAL CONCERNS:
The truck handles very well.  The steering is very tight with VERY little walking on the road.  No concerns at all with squeezing between a Semi and the concrete road construction retainer walls we all know so well.  You will notice a little bit of roll when corning in a tight curve at about 10-15 miles over the posted, suggested (yellow sign) speed limit.  But this is to be expected with big tires, 16" wheels, and ton of ground clearance.  With the auto transmission I am getting about 18-20 miles per gallon depending on my driving conditions.  I believe it has a 17.5 gallon tank... Last fill-up I squeezed 338 miles out my tank with about 2 gallons left.  The automatic transmission shifts VERY-VERY smooth.  I actually meant to include this before as I was quite impressed with it.  You will need to come to a full and COMPLETE stop before switching from reverse to drive or vice-versa.  This tranny is tight.  Not like some that will let you "switch directions" while still in a slight roll.
