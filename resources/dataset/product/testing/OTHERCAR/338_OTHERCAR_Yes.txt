            <b>The first time I saw an ad on television for the 2000 Xterra, I thought to myself, <i>"Wow... you gotta love that truck..."</i></b>

That television ad got me so hyped I could literally feel myself blasting through the forest, streaking down muddy roads spewing dirt and rocks every where, and ruthlessly driving over small furry creatures who happened across my path.  If I had that truck I could get to the top of that mountain... Sure I could!

I'd never seen anything like it before.  <i>(To use a few nifty industry review catch-phrases)</i> It had <b>aggressive styling</b>, <b>rugged good looks</b>, in short, it was an SUV like no other.

And the best part? It was available in deep forest green.

What better color for sneaking through the outback and driving through people's campsites?

<b>"You should get an SUV"</b>

A buddy of mine always said to me, <i>"You should get an SUV!"</i>

I always looked at him in disdain and shook my head, laughing.

To be honest, SUVs really did not appeal to me at all.  I mean, <b>really</b> didn't appeal to me.  I seriously thought <i>"Why would I need a redneck-mobile?"</i>  

I simply couldn't see the point.  To me, SUVs were in the same class as the 4-wheel hulks we have all seen driving the streets of any town.  You all know them.  The ones that have huge tires, sit 6 feet off the ground and have no real useful purpose at all?  Yeah, those ones.

<b>Ahh, but that commercial...</b>

That fateful day after witnessing the latest epic by Nissan, I really began to consider the SUV.  I could seriously see myself behind the wheel of one of these things.  That's when I began to contemplate the <i>"Other side."</i>

<b>So I went out and bought one</b>

Don't get me wrong.  It's not like I just leaped up off the couch and ran to my nearest Nissan retailer.  Yes, I did some research, and here's what I found out.

<b>**Brochure:</b>
Engine Type: 60-1/4 Fuel Injected V-6, Cast-iron block, aluminum heads.
Horsepower: 170hp @ 4800rpm.
Torque: 200lb-ft @ 2800rpm.
Transmission: 4-speed automatic

<b>Real Life:</b>
I seriously couldn't figure out why people were constantly complaining about the lack of *power with this vehicle.  I regularly leave the pack behind at stop lights, and can actually squeal the big 265/70SR15 tires from a standstill in drive as well as reverse.  On the highway the Xterra has absolutely no problems passing vehicles, though I must agree with another E-pinioner on the fact that it can be slow to respond when shifting into passing gear.

<i>(* In Canada, the 4-banger version was not available and the 6-cylinder was standard. Honestly, I couldn't fathom why Nissan would even bother offering this vehicle with a 4-cylinder engine.  Maybe that is the cause of all the no-power hooplah?)</i>

I don't know...  Maybe people are expecting to get a 9 second quarter mile out of this thing?  I didn't have any such notions, so personally, I wasn't disappointed in the power of this vehicle at all.  I mean, seriously, it's a truck.

<i>(Note: The Xterra is built on the Frontier pickup frame, and is essentially a truck with a cabin added)</i>

<b><i>(For the record, Standing quarter mile: 18.1 Sec/73.2mph)</i></b>

<b>**Brochure:</b>
Wheelbase: 104.3in./2649mm
Length: 178.0in./4521mm 
Width: 70.4in./1788mm
Height: 74.0in./1878mm
Ground clearance: 8.4in./213mm
Base curb weight: 4150lb
Suspension: <b>front:</b> Upper & lower control arms, coil springs, anti-roll bar/<b>rear:</b> live axle, leaf springs, anti-roll bar
Steering type: Recirculating ball, power assist
Brakes: <b>front:</b> Vented disc/<b>rear:</b> vented disc, ABS
Wheels: 15in. x 7.0in., cast aluminum

<b>Real Life:</b>
All in all, this truck is a great vehicle to drive.  At highway speeds, the ride is surprisingly quiet and comfortable. And though it has some roll through the corners, it feels quite secure and stable, as it is not too excessive.

<b>4WD</b>

Some have complained that the Xterra has a <i>"primitive"</i> 4WD system.  This is primarily due to the fact that the system will not shift into 4WD at speeds of over 25mph.

I mean, <b><i>come on</i></b>.

I don't know about you, but I've never had the overwhelming need to suddenly shift into 4WD while cruising at highway speeds.  I don't know, maybe it's just me, but for some reason I've never decided to do some "off roading" while on the way to grandma's house.

Personally, if you need to shift into 4WD at that speed, I wish you luck on your quick trip into the ditch. Maybe you can find out for all of us if these things roll as easily as safety inspectors say they do.

Here in The Great White North, the 4WD definitely comes in handy.  It pulls nicely through the deep snow, and road ice doesn't phase it at all. In my experience, the 4WD system is great, though sometimes the shifting mechanism tends to be a little sticky. In winter situations, it drives as if it's summer.

Goal achieved as far as I'm concerned.

<B>It's a big vehicle</b>

Due to it's size, strong winds tend to push the vehicle around at highway speeds, and the body tends to nosedive a little during extreme braking.

However, the nice thing about the size of this vehicle is that other drivers tend to respect you quite a bit more.  For instance, people tend to be intimidated by the large "bull bars" I had installed at the dealer. <i>(politically correct dealer name: "brush guard")</i>  This is a dealer option that I personally feel is quite necessary as it nicely rounds out the already "tough" look of this vehicle.

In all seriousness though, this vehicle is definitely not a car, and shouldn't be driven as such.  Most reviews I have seen judge this vehicle as if it should drive and respond like a car, and indeed, most recent SUV's are designed with that type of suspension and feel in mind.  however, I must re-iterate that this <b>is</b> a truck, and drives and responds as one.  Prospective buyers should keep this in mind when deciding whether to purchase the Xterra.

<b>**Brochure:</b>
Cargo capacity: 56 cu ft.
with rear seat folded: 65.6 cu ft.
Tow capacity: 5000 lb
Fuel capacity: 19.4 gal
EPA fuel economy: <b>city:</b> 15 mpg/<b>hwy:</b> 19 mpg
<i>(With regular fuel the vehicle definitely get this type of mileage, however, I tend to use premium gasoline which pulls an additional 40-45 miles out of each tank)</i>

<b>Real Life:</b>
There's definitely a lot of room inside this puppy.  I've gone on a number of extended trips, and no matter how much shopping you, (or your significant other as the case may be), tends to do along the way it never seems to get full. And this plethora of space doesn't extend strictly to your material possessions. The truck also has plenty of arm and leg room for driver and passengers.

<i>(I must say, unlike the brochures, I do not put a bicycle or anything of that nature inside.  I mean, if I'm busy driving a 4WD SUV, I'm really not likely to take my mountain bike off-roading.)</i>

<b>Other Stuff</b>

The interior is definitely not luxury and is quite spartan.  However, the no-nonsense layout gives the driver great access to all the important functions such as air conditioning and stereo. Everything is well within arm's reach.

The seats definitely feel overly supportive when initially purchased, however, over the year that I have owned the truck they have molded quite sufficiently to my butt, and they no longer feel as though they are too stiff.

<b>Stadium Seating?</b>

A unique feature of this vehicle is the rear "stadium" seating.  This results in the distinctive look of the Xterra with it's mid-roof bulge. Touted as a feature by Nissan, in reality, it is simply because the back seat is sitting smack-dab on top of the gas tank.  Nevertheless, all of the passengers I have had in the vehicle say they love it.  They appreciate being able to see the road over the driver's head, and I've heard nothing but compliments on the comfort of the seats themselves.

<b>Factory Options:</b>

<b><i>Standard:</i></b>
AM/FM CD 6 speaker stereo
Cruise Control
Air Conditioning
Tilt Steering
10 tie down hooks in order to fasten all of your gear

<b><i>My Dealer Installed Options:</i></b>

<b>My E-pinion?</b>

After owning this vehicle for well over a year, I would say that it has held up it's end of the bargain beautifully.  Unlike most automobile reviews you will read, this one is written after daily driving and long trips over an extended period of time rather than a simple weekend excursion or a "test drive" from the local dealership.

Overall, this vehicle has held up beautifully, and I still love it as much today as I did the day I drove it off the lot.  My big, lean, mean green machine is definitely here to stay.
