               We bought a new 1997 Neon because of the price. I couldn't decide on any specific type of new car that I really wanted so I chose economical and cheap.  I bought the Highline model with all the available options.  
   
   The options included a/c, cassette stero with premium sound speakers in 8 locations (can you imagine where 8 locations in such a tiny car might be?), rear defrost, and cruise control. There are not very many options to choose from on a compact car.

   The price including tax, tags, and title was $13,000.00.  The car itself served very well for a family of 4.  The trunk is huge.  Much roomier than any other compact car that I have seen.  The back seat is a good size, great for kids but adults I would only recommend short trips.  The car drives nice and smooth, a little noisy but hey, for the price you can't be to picky.  It is perky for having such a small engine and is great on gas.  

   I recently got rid of the Neon after 40,000 miles and never had a problem with it.  I was plesantly surprised by this vehicle and would recommend it to anyone on a tight budget looking for a reliable compact car.<br><br>
