            I bought this camera a year ago.  Back then, there were very few digital cameras under $100, and this was a decent deal at about $60 on sale.  Other cameras in its price range had resolutions of 320x240, or no flash, or some other features not as good.

This one takes 16 pictures at 640x480, has a flash, and a timer.  It connects to a computer via the serial port, or can output to NTSC video.  The software isn't great, but it gets the job done.

You cannot add memory to the camera, and there is only an optical viewfinder.  No LCD screen for a viewfinder or to review your pictures.  The batteries go fast, but all digital cameras seem to do that.  The camera carrying case is very tight on this, and makes it difficult to remove.  When removing it from the case, it is also very easy to squeeze the battery door and open it accidentally.

The best usage I can think of for this model is taking pictures of items to put on auction sites.  Scenic pictures need higher resolution, as do most things.  People at 25+ feet away are barely recognizable.

I would compare this to one of those disposable cameras.  It's cheap, and not as good as a real one.  But if you're looking for cheap, not so great digital pictures, this will work for you.

I would not recommend paying more than $40 for this model at this time.
