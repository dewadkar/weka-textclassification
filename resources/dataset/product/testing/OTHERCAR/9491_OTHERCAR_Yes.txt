            I have owned several Dodge vehicles.  Simply because I have always liked Dodge.  There is just one issue.  The transmission.  Every single Dodge that I have owned or know other people to own has had the transmission needing MAJOR work.  

But on the other hand the Dodge Ram is an awsome Truck.  When it first hit the dealers they sold like hotcakes.  The Ram revolutionized the way trucks were designed.  The Ram opens itself to a HUGE genre of people.  Everyone can own one.  It is sporty yet luxurious; rugged yet pretty smooth ride; different and liked; and a powerplant waiting to be switched on.  This truck is a vehicle to take notice.  It turn heads.  With so many options like a car with a truck at the same time you would think it is a raised El Camino of the 20th and 21st Century.  

I recommend this truck to just about anyone.<br><br>
