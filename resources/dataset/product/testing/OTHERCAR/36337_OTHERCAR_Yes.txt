            I purchased a brand new Celica in 1991 and I put 126,000 miles on it before I traded it in on a used 1994 Celica with 58,000 miles on it. 

I purchased these cars because they look good, they handle beautifully, and they are economical to drive. 

I discovered that with a set of winter treads on they could go through everything but snow so deep that the car would ride up over top of the snow and loose traction. I found that I could keep right up with most 4 wheel drives in winter due to the front wheel drive on my Toyota. 

I only had two problems with my 91 Celica: (1) The electric antenna quit working and I didn't replace it because I thought it was too expensive and (2) The radio shorted out at about 118,000 miles. 

I would not recommend this car for large individuals or people who have difficulty getting out of cars. I would also not recommend this car for large families unless they have a second car. 

If you want to have fun driving, this is the car for you.<br><br>
