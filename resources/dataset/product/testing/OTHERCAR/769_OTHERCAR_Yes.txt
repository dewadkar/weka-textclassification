            I got this camera because I am a bit of a shutter bug. Since film and developing are too expensive for me for the amount of photos I take, a high-quality digital camera was a necessity.
Look up the stats if you need to compare this camera to others, but I can save you some time. Instead, look at the price and see that this camera is extremely affordable and adaptable for enthusiasts and beyond.
When narrowing my choices I came down to this camera and the Sony FD-707. I chose this camera because it was smaller, the accessories are less than Sony accessories and the price was lower.  The Sony does have longer battery life, but I solved this by buying a couple extra rechargables.
Battery life is a little less than I would like, but compared to most cameras it is very good. Also, as the battery loses charge it takes longer to charge the flash, which can take about 3 seconds at times.
The flash is average for a fixed flash. A hot shoe is present which can help, and there is also a plug for accent lighting. Like I said, this camera is adaptable.
One small gripe I have about the flash is the sensor is placed about where I place my middle finger on my right hand. I have to be aware of this, because I ocassionaly block the sensor and get an inappropriate amount of flash.
One other thing I like about the camera is the 60 seconds of 30fps video and sound option. I wish you could shoot a length of video according the memory card you use, but 60 seconds is usually sufficient.
Overall I have been really happy with this camera, clicking off at least 400 photos a month for the last six months. This camera comes highly suggested from me, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for the quality of 5 megapixels without the budget for a $1000 camera.
