            Doesn't everyone want a digital camera!? I would think so. Think about walking down the street, seeing something interesting.. get your digital cam out and snap, your picture has been taken.

Now, to make that possible, you need a small camera, and the Canon Powershot S10 is a great candidate for that with its slick design.
I got the camera for regular camera use (birthdays, etc), but I thought it would be incredibly useful for pictures on my web site too.

The Canon Powershot S10 is an affordable model that is small and yet pack an earful of features. The LCD panel is of decent size and lets you browse pictures stored on the Compact Flash or allow you to take the picture without having to stick you eye next to the camera. Compact Flash is currently very affordable at about $20 and less for 8 meg cards online.

Unfortunately, the LCD drains the battery a lot so you will have to use it carefully.

Another sore point of this product is the trigger button. If you're used to an old style camera, you will have to press unusually long to make sure your picture is taken (2 to 3 seconds, not that much but substantial).

Pictures taken both during the day and at night yielded great quality. 

The coolest feature was to let the camera splice pictures together. This would be useful to photograph inanimate objects that usually are too big for conventional pictures. Using this feature, you can take the picture piece by piece and have the software put it all together at the end. Very clever.

Here's a a quick run down of this camera:

The Powershot S10 comes with one regular (non rechargaeble) lithium battery, a 8meg Compact Flash card, the USB cable to upload pictures to your desktop.

What's missing? a rechargeable battery with the power adapter, a case (this stuff is too expensive to carry around without a case)

Maximum resolution 1600x1200, 3X zoom (can be enhanced digitally).

After shopping around, I found the best deal at buydig.com where it was under $400. Would recommend for amateurs, but professionals might find this limiting.<br><br>
