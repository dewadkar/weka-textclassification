            Like the title states, I feel the Toyota Solara is much better than the new Honda Accord coupe.  I have a '99 SLE V6 that I picked up for $24,500.  Initially I test drove a Honda Accord Coupe, and had every intention of buying one.  But, I heard about the Solara, and decided to do a comparison test drive.  The rest is history.  Why, you might ask?  It is in the style of the vehicle.  I looked at the generic head piece of the Accord and really it did not do too much for me, although I loved the look of the rear.  With the Solara, I loved the looks, from the grills in the front to the sleek lines leading to an attractive rear.  In addition, the interior is much more tightly constructed than the Honda's, and the rear seats was comfortable enough to fall asleep in.  And as for the ride, it was a little too quiet.  I still sometimes do not know that I started the engine.  I have had the Solara now for half a year, and has offered me no problems what so ever.  It does eat a lot of gas, though.  I pay ~$34 a week, but I live in the Bay Area where high gas prices is the norm. In summary, the Accord coupe is a nice car, but the Solara offers much more.  <br><br>
