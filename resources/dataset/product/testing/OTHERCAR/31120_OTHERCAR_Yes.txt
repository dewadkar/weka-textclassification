            I read the comment cadream2 had on the 1994.  Read it if you haven't yet at <a href='/auto-review-2A76-1F79F666-397B8500-prod5'>http://www.epinions.com/auto-review-2A76-1F79F666-397B8500-prod5</a> .  That's pretty much how I feel.  I own a red jeep cherokee sport too.  Maybe it's something about the sport, but the seats are incredibly uncomfortable for all the passengers.  The front seat only lays partially back, so if you take any length of a trip, it's hard to rest.  The actual seat is shorter than many car seats and if you slouch at all, your bottom gets numb.  
Now the back seat has other problems.  The wheel wells make it very hard to get in and out of the car and shortens the length of the back seat, so really only 3 small children or 2 small children and an adult can fit in it and it isn't very comfortable for the adult.  Now, to the trunk, the spare tire takes up a lot of space.  However, there is still quite a lot of room.  And there is a cargo holder on the top that is useful.
Now, there are some good things about the jeep.  I've had no problems with it.  It doesn't get the greatest of gas mileage, though, but it's probably better than other SUVs.
To be fair, some good features of the jeep sport is the look and it seems to be built well.  I like the little holders on the ceiling for the car garage opener and your glasses and most of them have an area for your audio tapes to be stored.  
So, I guess I would suggest it for families who don't travel long distances a lot and who have no more than 2 young children.  It isn't a horrible car at all, just not much of a family car once the kids start growing up.<br><br>
