            I bought my little Tracker in the spring of '93 - late in the season, so they weren't being manufactured anymore, and the prices were dropping because the '94's were soon to be out.

I got all of the extra features - alloy wheels, power steering &amp; power brakes, adjustable steering wheel, etc. - except 4wd because on the lower end model, the 4wd was on the hub caps....and I knew I would NEVER use it if I had to do that.  I wanted to LOOK sporty....I didn't want to have to actually DO it. :)

I had been looking over different cars for about 15 months, and settled on the Tracker for several reasons.  I'm short, so I like to sit up high.  It was sporty-looking without the &quot;sportscar&quot; insurance costs.  And lastly, I read a really good review of it in Consumers Reports.

One of the things the review mentioned is that the Tracker (and its sister car, the Suzuki Sidekick) do NOT have the tippy/rollover problems that plagued the Suzuki Samarai.  Something it *didn't* mention that came out about a year later, was that there is a recall on the Rear Axle that affects both the '93 &amp; the '94.  

The seats are very comfortable, and since I put a lot of mileage on a car, I wanted something I'd enjoy driving.  The first week I owned it, I went on vacation and put over 1000 miles on it.  I've since put over 150,000 miles on it, and I've put it through hades, but I still love it. 

In '94 (barely a year after I bought it), it went through a Texas-sized hailstorm.  Golfball-size hail battered it for over half an hour.  Cracked the windshield, dented the hood &amp; front quarter panels, put little knicks in the paint all over.  It looked like somebody had taken a baseball bat to it.   

About 70k miles into it, I got busy and forgot to keep up my maintenance....the engine ran low of oil and I blew it out.  *cringe*  I know, I know.  Very expensive oil change.  

At that time, it was so new (about 3 years old) that Geo engines weren't available yet on the used market, and I couldn't afford a new one, so they ended up getting something similar and putting it in. It wasn't until much later (and a better mechanic) that I found out how much they jerry-rigged it to get it in there.

Since then I've had quite a few problems all stemming from the replacement engine, but the rest of the car has worked beautifully.  I had the clutch replaced at 150,000.  The transmission is still good.  All the interior gadgetry still works.  Because of this, I rated the reliability higher than my actual # of visits to my mechanic, because most of MY visits stem from something you won't experience.

At this point, I will probably drive it into the ground, and when it's so dead not even ET could bring it back, I'll go out in search of another car.  I might buy another Tracker....just not a '93.
