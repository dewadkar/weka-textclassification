            My father bought his 1996 Lexus ES300, fully loaded when it was new.  At the time, I thought it was a waste of money, which could be better used (in my view) buying stuff for me.  But I really can't complain anymore.  He has had this car now for four years, and when you drive it you notice the lack of glare from the sun, and just in general, lots of comfort.  There is plenty of room for up to five people with a large trunk for luggage, yet the car handles better than many other cars of that size.  With the small amount of maintenance and other costs he has needed to spend on the car, it has actually been worth all the money spent.  And he gets home from a long day on the road without being as tired as he would otherwise have been.  Although I personally prefer my sports car to his Lexus, I see that for him, the Lexus is the best car purchase he has made in years (and he has bought a lot of cars).<br><br>
