            Think back to 1995, IN a world of Ford Explorers and Jeep Grand Cherokees, did you ever imagine the emergence of today's Cadillac,Lincoln, Lexus,Infiniti, and Mercedes luxury sporty utility vehicles?  Mercedes brings AMG hammer power to the sport-utility class with its ML55 AMG.          The souls of this super-ute dwells in its engine. AMG starts 5.0 liter 24 valve V-8 from the SL500 and S500 and adds a forged-steel stroker crank that, in turn, adds nearly a third of an inch to the stroke, pumping displacement from 4966to 5439cc. The ML55's 5.4 liters V-8 makes 342 horsepower at 5500 rpm, 74 hp more than its ML430!!. AMG adds a larger cross sectionto the magnesium intake manifold to increase airflow, replaced the hollow-cast camshafts with even lighter modular ones, and increase the stiffness of the valve springs..<br><br>0-60 mph  6.8 seconds<br><br>Base Price:65,495<br><br><br><br><br>
