            I bought my 1995 2X4 because I really wanted a Jeep.  I wanted a new reliable car and I couldn't afford the 4X4 in the year I was looking at.  I really wish I could have!  I've owned it over a year and a half and so far I'm happy.  It gets me from point A to point B everytime.  I have had no problems although a small fender bender.  She held up very well!  The interior of my car although a 1995 looks dated.  I guess they finally updated the interior last year.  It's about time! The outside body has held up well, no rust to speak of.  The interior has held up very well too.  I'd say the only draw back owning the cherokee for me is the fact that I have to lift our small children in and out.  It's just too high for them to reach.  I guess that's the price you pay when you own a SUV.  The trunk is definately my favorite part.  There is no lip to lift groceries over, everything slides right in and out.  Also the seats fold down for larger loads.  It's a good family car and would be even better if mine had four wheel drive!<br><br>
