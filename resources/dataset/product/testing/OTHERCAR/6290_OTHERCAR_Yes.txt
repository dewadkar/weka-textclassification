            Let me say first of all, this is the best car I have ever owned. It has required less work and drives better than the others. Of course, the others were a 72 Plymouth, an 84 Pontiac and a 88 Ford Tempo. This car is head and shoulders above those.

I recently had to replace the water pump and that is the only major thing that has gone wrong with the vehicle since I bought it in the summer of 1998. The front tires tend to wear a bit and the suspension does squeak sometimes. Also the rubber lining around the doors is prone to falling off, and the doors often need a shot of wd-40. The car does have 82,000 miles on it however and it does get me where I want to go. I haven't driven it very far however, but it is a fairly reliable car and has never left me stranded. I hope to get another 20,000 miles out of it. 

For me, the Corsica has been a good car and a good investment. If you are looking for something to get around town, this car will do the job.<br><br>
