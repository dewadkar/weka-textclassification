            One of the features I was looking for in a digital camera was how to get the pictures to the computer.  I already had some bad luck with another camera, and found the serial cable method didn't work well.
This camera, the Toshiba PDR M4 has methods including the serial cable, USB, and the use of the Floppy disk drive.  With three computers, I can choose whatever method I want to upload and the camera came with all the cables too.
The manuals you get includes one for the software, and the other for the camera itself.  Very easy to read and understand, and even look up specific topics. 
I was blown away by the previewer, where the picture is very sharp, and you can choose the resolution/size as needed.  You can take color or black and white, and delete which pictures didn't turn out.
I've had as many as over 100 photos I can take with certain settings!  This easy to use camera comes with software that creates 'albums', and it includes the properties of each picture; such as the time and date the picture was take and the settings you took it with. This was a must-have for me since I am terrible at remembering the dates.
It is also nice to have the means to automatically take pictures with setting that make uploading faster.  
I cannot recommend this camera more.  I think it was worth every dime I spent, and as a first time mother, the pictures of my son have turned out great.  I also use this camera for business, for web design.
I'd give this camera more stars if they were available.<br><br>
