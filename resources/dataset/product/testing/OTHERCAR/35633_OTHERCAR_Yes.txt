            The Chevy Malibu is a beautiful car at a reasonable price.  The back seat has plenty of room for three people and also folds down to give you more trunk room. This is the perfect car for a mom with kids.  Its not too large and not to small. It does well on mileage.  I can go a whole week without filling the tank!  The storage bucket between the seats has enough room to hold a large stack of CD's, cassettes, etc.The cup holder also was a big help for me.  The glove compartment has got to be the largest I've seen in any car.  I love this car!  This isn't the car for people who drive on country roads or off the beaten path.  The undercarriage sits very low and has the tendency to drag if pulling out of very steep driveways or parking lots.<br><br>
