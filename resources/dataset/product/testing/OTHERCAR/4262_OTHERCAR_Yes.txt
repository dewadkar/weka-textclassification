            Ok, so maybe BMW's can be a little expensive for the average persons budget, but is it worth shelling out a few more dollars to buy it?

Yes!  Not only is BMW known for holding its price (resale value is high), it has an excellent warranty and any mechanical problems that do occur are minimal.  However, we repairs are needed they can be a little pricey if your not careful.

I bought my 1995 318i BMW 1 1/2 years ago and I love it.  I have had very few problems with it and it has been well worth the couple extra dollars I had to shell out for it.  It will be hard to ever go back to another maker if I had.<br><br>
