            I have had my 2002 T&C LXi for about 5 months now, so I will compare it to my 1999 Pontiac Montana which I no longer have.  

Looks:
Montana looks rugged;  T&C looks classier.  You decide.

Handling:
Montana has better handling, it is stiffer, but rides harder.  T&C has a lot of body roll, I get scared taking sharp turns at higher speeds, but it rides real smooth,  like a Lexus or Maxima.  

Creature Comforts:
I got the DVD, VCR, MP3 player.  However I got the &#147after-market&#148 version.  I can't tell you how disappointed I am.  The sound comes through your radio at station 88.9FM(varies), and I get so much static and outside noise that listening to a DVD movie is not worth it!  Lesson here is to get the factory installed version or forget it!!  This affects DVD, VCR, and MP3 playback, which are all mounted in the trunk; and it also wastes precious cargo space installed after-market.  Despite the sound, I do recommend you get the &#147factory installed&#148 version, because it is really cool to keep your kids happy while you cruise.

I had cloth seats in my Montana now I have the leather.  They were both comfortable, but if you have the extra money get the leather.

They both had removable 2nd and 3rd row seats, and the seats are equally as hard to remove from the van. You will break a sweat after removing one row.

Power sliding doors on the Montana have better control; hard to explain but T&C's door are too fussy; trust me.  Still, power doors are the way to go.

The power rear hatch is awesome, but that beeping sound is embarrassing while it opens or closes (unless you are a show-off, then its a good thing):)  This is a &#147must&#148 item for people with kids&#133..



Misc Features

The Montana had a better gas mileage and a larger gas tank. I used to visit the gas station once every two weeks. With the T&C I visit the gas station about once a week, because it has a smaller gas tank and worse gas mileage, this made me and my wife wish we had the Montana back.

Options to get:
Get the "factory installed" DVD &/or VCR (comes with headphones for split listening.)
Get the Power trunk and dual sliding doors
Get larger gas tank.

Make sure you get the power starter as well.  I start the car from inside my house and by the time I get to the car the temperature inside the van is just right!  And don't worry about someone jumping in the car while it's on because the doors remain locked and if you step on the brake without the key in the ignition it will shut off.  Also if you don't put the key in the ignition after 5mins it will shut off.

Listen, overall the T&C is a far superior vehicle, but it also cost $10,000 more.  If you don't have $37,000 for the T&C buy the Montana for $27,000.  The Montana is cool too, with many of the same features for less money.
