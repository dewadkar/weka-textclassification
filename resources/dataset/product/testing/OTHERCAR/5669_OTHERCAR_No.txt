<TEXT>
            I purchased the Canon S330 when it first became available in April of 2002. At that time there was no other digital camera offering the combination of the diminutive form factor, good image quality, and high zoom range that this camera possessed and although this camera is still a solid deal, there are smaller offerings from an array of digital camera manufacturers.

<b>Image Quality</b>
2 megapixels is considered low by todays standards but is still an amount capable of creating beautiful still photos. The automatic settings create a good picture but low light situations may create problems (which can mostly be enhanced and fixed with the included after-editing software.)

<b>Construction</b>
At first feel it is clear that this camera was built very durably but at the same time it is still relatively small and easy to transport. My camera has been dropped from a distance of 4 feet onto concrete floor and has gotten little more than a few scratches. The buttons all seem firm and are intuitively placed.

<b>Features</b>
The camera features an automatic mode, manual mode, panoramic mode, and film mode which takes low, medium, and high .avi films. The presentation screen is intuitive to use and a slide show can be easily presented on a t.v. using the included connecting cables. The camera also comes with software for importing and editing photos.

<b>Gripes</b> 
-The included 8mb compact flash card is too small unless you want to frequent your computer and import photos constantly.
-Large compared with todays standards.
-Included software is skimpy on any more-than-basic features.
