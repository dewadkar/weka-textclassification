            As the owner of a second 1998 Kia Sportage, the first was returned to the manufacturer because of an un-repairable electrical problem, I would not recommend this vehicle.

I will admit the Sportage is a nice looking vehicle which seems to appeal too many 20 and 30 something's out there. But, beware. The Sportage lacks power for any serious highway traveling, I have an automatic transmission and when it is cold you can actually hear the vehicle struggling through the gears. Gas mileage is pitiful for a 4 cylinder engine. Also trips to the repair shop have been too frequent compared to the Toyota that I once owner. 

Just imagine what the cost will be after the factory warranty expires then go drive a Toyota RAV 4 or a Honda CRV. Or even better save up some money for the new Nissan XTERRA.<br><br>
