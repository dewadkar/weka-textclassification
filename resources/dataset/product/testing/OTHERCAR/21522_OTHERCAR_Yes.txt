            I bought the Oregon Scientific 1.3 Megapixel camera just before a mission trip to Honduras and made everyone on the trip jealous.  Those without a digital camera wanted one like it and those with their own digital cameras were amazed at the price.

I found it at WalMart on clearance for $35.  I chose it because it was the only megapixel camera under $100 and all of the other cameras in my price range were offering no more than 680x460 sized photos (cheapo).  While I was amazed to find such a camera at a low price, I soon found the trade-off: Memory.  It is able to save only 5 full quality pictures in its built in memory, and that number would go down if the pictures were colorful.  You can change the resolution on the camera to store as many as 15 Low resolution Photos, but I bought a Megapixel camera to take Megapixel Photos.

I soon went back to Walmart and bought a 64MB Smartmedia Card for another $35 and slid it into the Camera.  WOW what a difference.  With a 64MB card the maximum number of High resolution Photos jumps from 5 to 240!  Freakin' worth it.

While I was on the Honduras trip I took about 100 pictures and most of them turned out fine.  Some of them turned out a little blurry because there is a 1 second delay from the time that the button is pushed to the time that the photo is taken.  Unlike everyone else with their expensive, power hungry, fancy cameras I never, over a period of 2 weeks and about 20 Pix per day, had to replace or recharge batteries(even now I am still using the same batteries).

The little thing even takes 60 sec video shots and stores them as Quick Time Files.  The quality is a little grainy, but remember the price and you can't beat that with a stick.

Rarely, when I turn the device on, the camera freezes up and won't work.  This only happens after the power button and never threatens the integrity of a Photograph.  The easy way to fix it is to open the battery cover and then close it again.

It does not have a digital display built in, which is another example of cost-cutting, but it does come with a little cable to hook it up to most TVs.  With this, you can take the camera back to a Hotel room and review or delete the photos taken.

These two small cost-cutting deficiencies aside, I really think that a camera this good at that price simply must not be ignored.  It works well, is easy to use, and it is very convenient and economical.  If I didn't already have one, I'd buy one.
