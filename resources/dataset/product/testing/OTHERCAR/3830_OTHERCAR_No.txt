            Realize aesthetics mean as much to me as reliability and practicality.  I really wanted to buy this car.  I'd seen it at the car show in Annaheim.  The tail lights were kind of cool, though a rip-off of the ones found on Volvo's cross-country wagon.  The hood was up at the time and probably for good reason.  Now that the car is out I see that the car has the oddest front grill/bumper I've ever seen.  I don't have a single friend who doesn't think it's downright ugly.  They couldn't leave the black bumper well enough alone.  In some misguided attempt to make the car more "agressive" looking, they have these two black prongs extending up from the front bumper and onto the hood.  It's just nasty looking.  The seat covers are hideous even on the upgraded EX model.  The bolstering is covered by cheap-to-the-touch vinyl and the seat panel has a tacky patterned cloth.  If that weren't enough, the gear shifter is neither between the seats or on the steering column.  It's on the dashboard, causing you to have to lean forward every time you want to shift.  The emergency brake will be cool to some and silly to others.  It too is integrated into the dash as this sort of lever not unlike that on a slot machine you find in Vegas.  And in the same way, you have to pull it towards you like you were going for the three cherries.  If you don't have good bicep muscles, pass on using the emergency brake.  By the way, if you do get this car, I recommend the black interior over the saddle.  While I prefer a lighter-colored interior, the saddle is this nasty looking orange-tan-brown pukey looking thing.  It's just nasty.  The black interior obscures the ugly pattern in the seat cover.  If you get a black exterior, then you won't notice the ugly moustache looking front bumper.  I just don't happen to care to own a black car, too funereal.  Now, if you go to WWW.CANADIANAUTOREVIEW.COM you will see that in Canada the car is offered with a nice color bumper, sans moustache, and nice leather seats are available.  That's not true in America.  Leather seats are not offered by Honda of America nor is a color bumper.  Why these nice touches were saved for Canada, but not available in the US just points up the short-sightedness of Honda of America.  After a year on the market, they'll get it and offer the color bumper and leather seats.  But I need a car now.  Sorry Honda, not this time around.  I really wanted you.  Oh let me end on a positive note, the stereo system is much improved from last year.  But having said that, as a tall person, the seating position which is complimented on in auto magazines is not as improved as they say.  Believe it or not the legroom and seating position is much better on the much smaller Acura RSX, a vehichle I test drove, which is not even an SUV. PS: I agree with one of the other reviewers who said while the center console tray is a nice touch, it's cheaply constructed and cheap looking.
