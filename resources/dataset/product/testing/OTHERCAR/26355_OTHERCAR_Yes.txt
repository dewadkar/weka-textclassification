            Purchased this digital camera about 2 months ago.  Couldn't be more happy.  For a beginner in digital camera's and their operation, this camera is simple to use and easy to understand.
Picture taking is very easy.  Mode selection is simple.  We've taken pictures of everything from hot air balloons to frogs with ease.
Zoom capacity is excellent for this midrange camera.  The quality of the pictures that the DSC-P71 produces is excellent.
One drawback is the size of the storage card that comes with the camera.  Comes with an 8mb stick of memory.  Not quite enough for one sitting if you use the camera in high quality mode.  We purchased a 128mb stick and you can fit about 100 high quality pictures on it.  Worth every penny if you can afford the upgrade.
Also has mpeg capacity.  Only drawback here is that there is no sound capability with this model camera.  Still, the quality of the mpeg's is outstanding.
Camera size is really handy.  Doesn't take up much room, while still have a decent sized LCD screen on the back.  LCD could be bigger, but works well.
All in all, this is an excellent camera for anyone looking to buy their first digital camera.
