            My best friend and I drove her <b>1995 Geo Metro</b> to our 20 year high school class reunion 5 years ago and really had a lot of people staring at us!  That was because of all of the people, prestigious or not, WE were the only ones driving up in a new car!

Now that the car is over five years old, guess what?  It STILL looks like a new car, drives like one, and the rate it is going it's going to STILL look like one five MORE years from now.

The <b>1995 Geo Metro Sedan</b> was the very first car that my best friend purchased brand new.  Over the years she had many cars but they were always used when she bought them.  Consequently they had many problems which required maintenance.  So, having a new car became a necessity to her as she was the taxi service for not only her mother but to her elderly grandmother.  

This car fits her to a T.  She is married, has no children, so she and her husband are usually the only passengers.

For most of the times that she and I have been in the car together, it's been without my children.  That's a good thing too because the back seat of this car isn't much of a back seat at all.  I managed to get into the back two times.  One of those times was for the high school reunion and another time was when we had to bring my youngest son to the hospital for stitches.  There really is not any room back there at all unless you have very small children.  With my oldest son in the front side passenger seat, there was barely enough room for my youngest on right behind him.

However, this car really has a remarkable pickup.  Because my best friend has a degenerative spinal disorder, I have often driven this car places with her as the passenger.  The 4 Cylinder, 1.3 Liter, 70 Horsepower Engine really has a remarkable pickup considering that it is a small engine at that.  Yet the car gets about 38 miles per gallon in the city, which really helps financially considering gas prices remain rather high. The car steers well and has a really small turning radius.

The air conditioning will freeze you out of the car literally and we've not had to wait for an extended period of time to have the heater kick in.  Even the AM/FM/Cassette player is really rather nice for a smaller, inexpensive car such as the Geo Metro.

If I have to point out a flaw to the car other than the cramped back seat, it would be this.  There are parts to the Geo Metro which have to be ordered from the manufacturer.  This includes some basic items such as windshield wipers.  I find this to be something that is going to cause more problems in the future should the car require major repairs.

Also, the resale value of the Geo Metro is really rather low too which I feel is not justified.  This is a really nice little car just like the 1995 Geo Prism which I reviewed earlier and I don't believe they deserve that type of negative devaluation.

I see my friend driving her little maroon Metro now for many years to come without problems, and because of the high quality of the performance of this car, I am happy to highly recommend it to all of you.<br><br>
