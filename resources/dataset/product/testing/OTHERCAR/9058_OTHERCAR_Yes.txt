            My uncle has had a bmw 325i for a couple of years and he loves it.  Since he ahs taken care of it, the car has stayed in great shape and rides like it did when he first bought it, nice and smooth.  The front seats are very comfy and spacious though the back seats are cramped.  In the summer the leather gets very hot and sticky though seeing as how he lives down south.  He has had a few engine problems though but those were probably do to reckless and careless driving.  Ever since he has had it I don't know when I have turned down a ride with him.  The 325i is a great car if you can afford it.  I would recommend it to people who like to drive fast and who like luxury cars.  I would also recommend it to a lawyer.<br><br>
