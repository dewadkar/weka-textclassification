            When I bought a digital camera I wanted a digital camera to carry in my pocket that I could
pull out and take a fast shot and quickly close back up again, and one that took quality
pictures. Some of the models that I tried at took as long as 12 seconds to open or close, but
this camera was the best of all. 

Many of the current crop of digital cameras are still in the &quot;Instamatic&quot; stage. Most of them
have very poor ergonomic designs. For example if you look through the view finder on many
DCs your nose will hit the LCD and smear skin oil or makeup on it; some models are OK for
right handed people but not left handers and viceversa. 

A lot of these cameras seem to be made for people with tiny hands; it's easy to cover up the
flash, light meter or IR opening. Add these shortcomings the mysteries of multifunction buttons
and you get a real user unfriendly product. The S10 address these problems quite well and is
very user friendly. 

In 6 months there will be a whole new generation of digital cameras. You will see a lot more
single lens reflex models and hopefully more useable features instead of gadgets for controls.
This means that most of the cameras sold today will be far outclassed (read obsolete) by this
time next year.
