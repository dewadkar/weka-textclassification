            I bought my Kia Sportage 4x4 new in 1999.  It is a 5peed 4X4 with a 2 speed transfer case.  Since then, I have put alot of miles on it doing the normal things like shopping, hauling kids, camping, canoeing, and off roading.  In all of these categories, the little four banger has pulled through very well.  
So far, I have only had to replace the Condenser cooling motor, get a front end alignment and basic maintenance.  It has been very useful and practical.  The two speed transfer case has proven to be a life saver at least two times for me, getting me over some icy hills (that some other 4X4's were sliding off of) prompting my father, a huge skeptic to comment, "Well, I guess this is a pretty good little car"... his neighbors had all slid of the road in their big American trucks.  As for the fit and finish of the car, it is put together well, all the controls are easy to reach and operate with the exception of the rear window wiper.  It is hidden behind the steering wheel and you have to feel around for it if you don't want to take your eyes off the road.  Gas mileage is fair, don't expect Hybrid mileage, it gets around 23-25 mpg depending on conditions.  There is enough power there for most driving needs.  If you want to go 0-60 in 5 seconds, get a sports car, not a Sportage.  
Overall, the car is great, small enough to go anywhere and big enough for most chores.  It does get a little cramped with four people in it, but it just fine for my wife, my son and myself.  It will haul groceries, sports equipment, bikes and even your mother in law.  Again, it does well off road and with the low price you pay for it, your stomach doesn't get in a knot each time you bottom out.
