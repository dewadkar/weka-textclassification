            The Volkswagen Golf GLS, 2002

Compact and Loaded to the Max.

Even if the size of this VW product puts it in the compact category, it still comes fully loaded with standard features and the price tag also comes with it.

You will have the choice of two different trims when shopping for a Golf. There is the GL trim, which has three doors, and the GLS trim, which has five doors.

The odd door of course is due to the fact that the Golf always comes in a hatchback design

The Golf is offered with a variety of engines, the one I test-drove was a GLS (5 doors) with a two liters engine under the hood.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The Volkswagen Golf GLS has a curb weight of 2820 pounds, with a wheelbase of 98.9 inches. It measures 163.3 inches long and 68.3 inches wide.

If you need extra interior space the hatchback design combine with the 60/40 split folding rear seat will add extra space when you need it.

The Golf I test-drove had a 2 liters engine under the hood, but you can also select from a 1.9-liter diesel engine that develops 90 horsepower or a 1.8 turbo charged motor that will develop 150 horsepower. Both engines are optional so you will have to pay extra for them.

THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR

The interior:

As soon as I opened the front door, I knew I was not going to like this interior. Not that there is any wrong with the design of it, it just that it was dark gray and since the exterior body paint was dark blue, it sure made for a
somber automobile.

Once behind the steering wheel, I proceeded to find a comfortable setting for the seat. From there you will have an excellent front and rear view, I do believe that the side view mirrors are a little too small and this can give you a much larger blind spot than you would whish for.

All the gauges are easy to see and the controls are within easy reach of the driver position.

The front leg and headroom is quite acceptable for the Golf which is a compact car after all, as for the rear seat the headroom is OK but the legroom is at a premium.

The Golf I test-drove was loaded with a long list of standard features: It came with air conditioning, power windows, power locks, power mirrors, tilt steering
wheel, cruise controls, AM/FM radio cassette and rear window defroster.

It also had the following optional features: Top quality leather seats, CD player, sunroof and alloy wheels.

The quality of the sound coming from the eight speakers was excellent, this is a pleasant surprise, for I have never too impressed with the quality of the sound in VW&#146s before.

Well I guess the only negative part aside from the small side view mirrors I can really find in the golf I drove, is the color selection for the interior.

The exterior:

I do not think that any car that is an hatchback could ever win a style contest and this goes for the Golf, it is not a beautiful automobile to look at, it is more of a practical car.

The golf does have lots of cargo space; it is rated a 18 cubic feet.

The selection of alloy wheel on the Golf I drove was very nice.

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

It was a good driving experience taking the Golf for a spin, I would much prefer the more powerful engine, more so if you plan to do a lot of highway driving. As for city driving it handles real well.
