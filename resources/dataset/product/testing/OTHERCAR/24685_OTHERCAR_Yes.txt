            We own a 2000 Venture LS (std length).  We took delivery of it in late April and have had no real problems.  The only thing that needed correction was the passenger door latch (sticking).  It was easy enough for me to adjust so I took care of it.  
We looked at the Honda, Ford, Dodge, and Toyota.  Most wanted too much money or had too many options built in, or you had pay too much and wait 2 months for it (Honda).
The Venture handles great, gets good MPG; we've gotten no less than 23 MPG and as high as 27 MPG so far.  The ride is quite thanks to good tires and a firm, but forgiving suspension.  The back end does want to sway somewhat in quick maneuvers, but recovers well. We haven't been on any extended trips yet, but are looking forward to a trip to Florida this December from Virginia.
Pros:	visibility, handling, MPG, feel (ergonomics), strong engine (3.4L V6) teamed with an equally good transmission, 20 Gal. Gas tank (25 on extended length), cargo room (w/ or w/o seats), handsome appearance.
Cons:	No all wheel disk brakes (good braking, but 4x disks would be best),  sturdy, but heavy seats (2 bench row seats (x4) range from 38 to 60 lbs. each).
A trick to learn about removing the bench type seats - slide them to their fullest rear position before unlatching them and tilting upward.  Make sure the driver and passenger front seats are moved forward somewhat.  This gives the bench seats plenty of room to stand making it easier for you to lift them outï¿½ big difference.
We were impressed enough about our purchase and product experience that we wrote a letter to the dealer and GM, something we've never done before, for any purchase.  We highly recommend the Venture to anyone who needs the cargo or people capacity and likes true value for their dollars spent.
