            My neighbor bought this digital camera recently, and I asked if I could play with it for a day or two so I could write a review on it.  My neighbor chose this camera because he thinks the coolpix stands out from this fixed lens class because the quality of the images, a lot of manual control, a really nice lens.

I am by no means a professional, but I have had my share of using digital cameras in the past and this one gets the job done with great results!  I don't have a superiorly keen eye for quality, but this camera seems to take very nice pictures.

My first impression of this camera was that is looked like a regular 35mm job.  The Coolpix 700 has a hard plastic body that is very durable. The fit and finish is very good and fits in your hand nicely with the hand grip on its right side. Camera is small and lite for easy travel, but isn't too small that handling becomes a problem.  The camera comes with a lens cap, but it falls off quite easily, I think a strap would be nice.  

The LCD is 1.8&quot; and works well at 30fsp.  The menus were very easy to use with its folder setups and it's up and down scroll buttons.  You can view up to 9 images at one time and zoom in on each picture to check quality.  Camera has 4 buttons on top for easy access to flash, picture compression, delete, self timer and distance. There is also 2 buttons on rear to shut monitor off and menu control.  Image quality is great with its 1/2-inch 2.11 megapixel lens. 

The colors came accurate and bright. You have 2 image size 1600x1200 and 640x480. 3 compression ratios 1/4 fine,1/8 normal and 1/16 basic. One thing I think is a must have is the uncompressed tiff format as compression can sometimes degrade a picture and if you do printouts of 8x10 you may need it. After useing for a little while, I did find some purple haze in high contrast areas as in most 1/2 in. 

If you are planing to do a lot of picture taking I would highly recommend to buy battery charger and NiMH batteries. Battery life in this camera is not as bad as some others. I got about one hour out of alkaline batteries with lcd on sometimes. Downloading to computer is slow with its serial port connection and if you use Tiff files, go for the USB, PLEASE!  If you're interested in a &quot;Middle-of-the-road&quot; digital camera, you may want to check into this one further.<br><br>
