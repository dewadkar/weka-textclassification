            I purchased this 2000 Nissan Pathfinder about 8 months ago.  It has been a huge headache and a terrible tragedy.  I tried out the 4x4 shortly after purchasing and shifting into 4 high was fine.  When actually stopping and shifting into 4 low (book say you can go up to I believe 20 or 30 MPH) the transmission or gearbox (maybe both) made a terrible grinding noise.  I didn't think I could get it out of 4 low and it was like it was in park even when stepping on the accelerator, wouldn't move (thought I was stranded).  After finally getting it back to 2wd (fighting with it for nearly 5 minutes) I went to the owner's manual immediately to make sure I was shifting correctly and I was.  I took it to the local Nissan dealership and was told the owner's manual was wrong and that I should stop completely and shift to neutral before going to low 4 as contrary to the owner's manual (sounds like I purcahsed a fossil from the 70's early 80's.  After arguing with the dealership I called the 800 number for Nissan and they confirmed I was correct and that I should go back and make them fix it although they claim at the the local dealership that it is ok.  Also the owners manual shows many inconsistencies, like infant carrier hooks that don't actually exist and the almost non-existent rear cup holder.

I purchased a new vehicle and have ended up with an overpriced (nice looking) piece of junk and the Nissan corporation is not willing to help or stand behind there products after may repeated calls.  They tell me to take it to another dealership (80 miles away).  I don't have time to Believe me this is the last Nissan that will be in my garage.  Also when I bought this, I purchased there extended (unextended) warranty so it will be unuseful beyond the normal unuseful warranty.  Stay away from this one!
