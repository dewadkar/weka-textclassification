            I began shopping for a small, economical little truck when I got a job in a town 20 miles away.  My '67 Chevy just sucked way too much gas to drive back and forth.  So, like everyone else shopping for a small Japanese truck, I shopped for the typical Toyota or Mazda 4x4.  But when I began shopping for these, the prices were outrageously high!  Even for a 1984 Toyota pickup that was beat up, they wanted $5000!  I was about to give up and get a small car when I saw this nice looking little Isuzu at my local car dealership.  
I never even thought about buying one of these, simply because they just aren't something you see everyday on the road.  I got a closer look at it, and it was pretty much still a brand new truck!  The interior was still like new in every way, and with the exception of a few minor scratches, the outside was pretty much flawless as well.  And to top it all off, there was only 60,000 miles on it!  I figured he couldn't want less than $10,000 for this nice little truck, but to my surprise, it was only $4,500!  
I can't reccomend a better little truck for the money!  I honestly don't have any big complaints about this truck.  The cab is spacious, with very comfortable seats, the 3.1 liter V6 engine has plenty of power, and runs incredibly strong!  The truck handles almost like a car, and is easy to drive in town, or offroad, or anywhere!  I honestly could not reccomend a better truck for the money!  Consider an Isuzu next time your looking for a small 4x4 pickup!<br><br>
