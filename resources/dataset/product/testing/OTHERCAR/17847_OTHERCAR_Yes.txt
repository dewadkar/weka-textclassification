            Recently a co-worker of mine leased a 2000 Chevy Blazer. I had the opportunity to ride in it on our way to work one day. Well on our way to work we got cut off by a guy who thought he was the shiznit cause he was talking on a cell phone and driving a BMW. Well that was a bad move on his part cause in a fit of road rage my co-worker rammed the back of his car causing the guy's rear bumper to fall off but we weren't done yet.
We kept ramming his car till he swerved into a wall. It was pretty funny.

Well the moral of this story is don't cut a person off if they are driving a Blazer cause the can run you off the road if they really wanted to. I wish I had a Blazer cause there have been many a time i could've used it to run some coloreds over.<br><br>
