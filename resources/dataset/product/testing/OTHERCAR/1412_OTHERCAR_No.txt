            My first new car experience was with a 1998 Plymouth Neon Highline. Two weeks after I bought it, there was a water leak that left an inch of ice on the floor of the back seat. They took it back and replaced the rear passenger window seal and the carpet. A couple months later, the trunk seal was sliding off. The next thing to go was the window liner on the driver's window. I took the car in several times for the same rocket-type noise and was told it was a &quot;normal Neon noise&quot;. This normal noise turned out to be a new engine and a fuel pump. This is all before it is even two years old. In February, they ordered me a new headliner because mine was falling down. The first week in March of this year, I found, yet again, an inch of ice on the floor in the back. You couldn't begin to ring any of the water out of the floor mats, but the trunk was dry. I got a call the next day and they said the leak was coming from my tail lights. Yup, OK. At this point, I have had enough. I called Chrysler's Corporate office twice looking for some sort of compensation for paying for a car I was never really allowed to drive. The second time I called, I spoke with a man who told me that if I was never going to buy one of their products again, why should he help me...I wrote a letter to the President of Chrysler, the Attorney General, and traded the car in. I lost $2000 on the trade-in and swear to never allow anyone I know get a lemon like the Neon. <br><br>
