            I bought the Lexus ES300 after shopping all of the foreign luxury cars in this class that liked (Infinity, Acura and BMW).  I ultimately decided on the Lexus because of the comfort, features, value, predictable reliability and SLEEK looks!  I am also convinced that the resale will be much better when I'm ready to trade it in about five years from now.  The black/charcoal 2-tone exterior and full Coach leather, sage colored interior was just the right combination to beat the competition for my money.  I also strongly considered the Acura 3.2, but for only $2,000 more, I went for the Lexus.

This vehicle is very quiet and the ride is smooth.  It's a real pleasure to drive.  The high intensity  headlights put out enough lighting to increase my feeling of safety when driving at night.

I would strongly recommend this car for the luxury car buyer that is looking to spend in the low 30's.  The resale, comfort and reliability makes this a great choice for the entry level luxury car buyer.  The only people that shouldn't buy this car are those that have very long legs and frequently haul 3 passengers in the back.  It would be cramped for those.                <br><br>
