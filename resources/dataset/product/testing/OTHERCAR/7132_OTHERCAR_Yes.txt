            The Chevy S10 is cute, sassy, &amp; fun to drive.   Being a small truck it's great for many of the things you need a truck for, but you can still get into a parking place with out difficulty. I bought my S10 because I needed a truck for hauling my art &amp; every thing else.  The Chevy S10 is easy on gas, it's compact in size, &amp; has great maneuverability.  It has all the advantage of a small car, but you can haul stuff.  It's a great auto for a female that doesn't want a big truck but still needs the advantage of a truck.  it's great for young people still in school, &amp; don't forget that young budding cowboy.  
What I love about it is the way it drives.  It drives quick &amp; sassy, turning with ease into the most difficult parking places or what ever.  It's ease of handling, it's smart looks, it's hauling ability's, &amp; the price isn't to bad either.  I got to keep my first born child.  Also at the price, you can afford it along with another car.  most people have two cars anyway.  I got mine with cloth seats which as all ladies know it doesn't burn or freeze you when your in a dress. The seats are very comfortable. 
The things I don't like about it are, you only have room for 2 or 3 people &amp; really 3's a crowd in the S10. So if you have children it's not the automobile for you. It is also light weight so you need to throw some big logs or a few big rocks in the back in the winter time when there's snow &amp; ice to help with the traction.  But my best friend has a big truck &amp; she has to do that too. Also if the road is really rough you can feel it.  But I don't feel that it is a miserably unbearable ride.  
The service at the chevy dealer is very good.  We needed a new battery &amp; they replaced it without a problem, &amp; they checked every thing to make sure that there wasn't another problem.  
Insurance on the S10 is very reasonable also.
For people who need a truck but can't or don't want to pay the incredibly high prices on a pickup truck now days, the Chevy S10 is a very good buy.  One of the best trucks in it's class.<br><br>
