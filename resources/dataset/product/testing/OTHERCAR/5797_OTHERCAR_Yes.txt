            I received this product as a gift last month.  Needless to say, this is a wonderful gift and I couldn't wait to start using it.  There are many advantages/disadvantages to digital photography like the ability to save only the good shots and limited development options.  However, this review will focus primarily on the pros and cons of this camera.

<b><i>The Good </i></b>
Ease of use: This camera is a great mix of functionality and ease of use.  It can be used quite effectively as a point and shoote but also has some of the bells and whistles of a pro's camera.  This camera is ready use right out of the box.
Picture Quality: Excellent.  Even at the medium setting (which allows 36 pictures for the included memory card) there is enough granularity for a 8X10 picture.  This level of quality is more than enough for the average user but there options that allow a lesser number of pictures at a lower quality or vice versa.
Zoom: This camera has a 3X optical zoom along with a 2X digital zoom.  I find the 3X zoom to be more than adequate for my use.  
LCD Display: I find this feature the most fascinating on any digital camera.  This model has brillant color and an on/off feature (which saves batteries).  I can take several photos with the LCD off and then review on the LCD where I can erase, zoom or save.
Lens: This digital camera's design includes a built in lens cover. Im sure this will be invaluable in keeping my lens scratch free.  

<b><i>The Bad </i></b>
Flash: On this model, you are required to manually flip up the flash.  I find this the most annoying feature because I never remember to do it.  I suppose I can't really blame Olympus for my forgetfulness but I would have prefered an auto open flash to be in the design.
Size: My other camera is a Canon Elph, so you could say I am spoiled when it comes to camera size.  Compared to other digitals, this model is pretty small but not small enough.  Easily will fit into purse but will never fit into your pocket.  
Lens: As mentioned above, this camera comes with a built in lens cover.  As a result you need push the cover slightly and allow the lens to retract before shutting it down.  A slight inconvienence only.
Cost: Its expensive and so are its accessories.  The camera itself is 400 dollars not to mention an extra memory card which is close to another hundred.  A USB port to attach to your pc which makes downloading pics much simplier is an additional few bucks.  And developing cost approx .50 cents per picture for 4x6.  Digital Photography is not for the poor!

All in all, I really like this camera.  If you like to take pictures, the advantages of digital can not be beat.  Of course, don't throw away your 35mm just yet - it comes in handy when you need something small or not so valuable to tote around with you.
