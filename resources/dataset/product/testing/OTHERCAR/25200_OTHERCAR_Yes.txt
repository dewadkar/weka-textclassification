            In looking for a new car, I have rented multiple compact cars.  Good if not great mileage was a major consideration.  The Mazda Protege' LX met all of the requirements I was looking for in a car. The mileage is great.  Better than I have ever achieved in a Cavalier.  The steering is easier than I have experienced in a Cavalier, as well.  The controls for windshield wipers &amp; headlights are within reach of the steering wheel.  They are easy to reach when driving, The instrument panel is easy to read during day &amp; night driving.  The climate control is also within reach and easy to decipher.  Seating is comfortable, even during long trips. Trunk space is generous and is accessible through the back seat.  The kids love that option.

Another way the car proves it's economy is in general maintenance.  It takes fewer than 3 quarts of oil to complete an oil change.  Being a four-cylinder, obviously it requires 4 spark plugs.  These may seem to be small savings, a four cylinder versus a 6 or 8 cylinder vehicle, but if you plan on keeping the car for a significant amount of time, these expenditures add up.  In addition, larger cylinder vehicles usually require at least 2 more quarts of oil (5 quarts per oil change), more spark plugs, the necessary spark plug wires (necessary during a tune up), and larger tires which add up to a significant amount of money as well.

There are only two vehicles that I have driven that received better gas mileage. One was a Mazda 929 and it may have had a larger gas tank.  The other, a Chevrolet Impala.  But for the price, I could not beat my Protege.
