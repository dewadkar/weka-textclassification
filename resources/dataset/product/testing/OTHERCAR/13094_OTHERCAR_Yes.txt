            	That's the perfect way to describe my soon-to-be husband's Honda Accord!  20000 miles so far and it runs like a charm. I say this because of the sole fact that I have driven it myself!

	This is a car that is not only sporty, but it also runs good and is a very reliable winter car. It doesn't fish-tail around the corners like those trans-ams and Camaros do.  Those cars are junk in the winner, but then again the drivers of those kinds of cars also seem reckless to begin with, so maybe it's not really the car.  The Honda Accord drives through the snow very efficiently.  The only way you'll slide in this car is if you're one of those careless folks who think its fine to race around a corner at top speed or one of those types who doesn't gradually come to a stop.  If you're a courteous, careful driver, then you'll really appreciate how this car handles. 

	This vehicle is not only sporty and reliable, but also very luxurious.  The seats are comfortable, the heat cranks, the A/C is wonderful to you on the hot summer days, the power windows never freeze and even the radio sounds great. This car is great on gas too.

	So if you're looking for an affordable car with some excellent features and reliability, then the Honda Accord Coupe is the car for you!
