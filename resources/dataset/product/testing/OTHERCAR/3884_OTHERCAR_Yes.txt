            This has to be one of the best minivans ever built for the price.  The comfort and sheer leg room are great for long trips or even trips to the parks with the kids. I love the feeling of sitting higher up than a car because i feel like more control over my surroundings. The dual sliding doors are great for getting the kids in fast and easy without much hassle. The minivan drives very smoothly and even has a little pickup when it's needed. A downfall for me would have to be the angle of the windshield. I am just use to the normal angle that most vehicles have so it was hard for me to adjust to. I would recommend this minivan most for families since it is great for trips but it can be perfect for just about any need.<br><br>
