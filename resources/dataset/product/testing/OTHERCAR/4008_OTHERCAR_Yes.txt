            I personally do not own a Saturn L series but have been working for a Saturn dealership for about two and a half years, and through experience of working on the cars and their parts, I have learned a lot about this model. The L series overall is reliable car, but since Saturn did rush the production of this car it does have a few minor glitches here and there. This car is not for people who seem to loose their patients easily, because like every new car line that brings out a new model, it will have several small problems. Generally these problems have ocurred in the cabin of the car. The drive train of the Saturn is very strong especially the V-6 engine. The styling of the car I feel is also original and, like the smaller S series, has the polymer body panels. I would also like to mention that these polymer panels are dent resistant, but not scratch resistant.<br><br>
