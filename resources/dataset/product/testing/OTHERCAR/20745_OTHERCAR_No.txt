            I bought a two door four wheel drive blazer 14 months ago.  I had such luck with my previous one (1986) that I decided to get another.  I currently drive 100 miles daily to and from work, and travel frequetly on the weekends with my family. (wife, dog - siberian husky, 5 month old boy)  
LIKES:
1. Sporty looking, very eye appealing.
2. Good engine VORTEC V 6, has pick up and strength.
3. Dependable, so far routine oil changes and new tires.
4. Agility, has the ability to maneuver in the big cities (Chicago,St.Louis,Indianapolis,Kansas City)
5. Good for individual owner or a couple.
6. Cost, very reasonable compared to it's competitors
7. Resale value is good

DISLIKES:
1. ROOM, not enough space for a growing family.  
2. Drive, it is a bumpy ride, not as smooth as it's competitors
3. Need easier access to the rear seats, anyone older than 29 will have some difficulty, especially bigger people.
4. Impossible to put a car seat in and out of the back seat.
4. The spare tire on the tail gate henders rear vision.
