            Background:

I purchased this 850 as my first car, and to this date it has been wonderful even though its mileage is now north of 150,000.  This car as with any other European car is not by any means perfect; however considering other cars from the Nordic region it is fairly well rounded.  My 850 has endured years of hard use, anything from carrying a carload of kids to school every morning (during highschool) at above legal speed limits to moving me to two different locations.  Your first car, especially the one you learned to drive, will always have roots with you; that is possibly why we still have it today.  The Volvo is not my main car today, we didn't trade it in on the Honda because the trade in value on these Swedes is ridiculously low, and so it was worth more to us just to keep it.

Overview:

     Yes, it's from a foreign land, so therefore the repair/maintenance costs will be higher than on your average Chevy.  But, you have to consider what the Volvo provides you with that American cars don't.  First, it has quality, something lacking in about every vehicle rolling off the assembly line in Detroit.  Secondly, the design is superior; remember the saying "form follows function"?   Well, the 850 has always put safety and practicality over style. Volvo has been successful with the "boxy but good" mentality because unlike cars with the swoopy rear rooflines (like the new S60 to make it look "coupe like") this car doesn't eat up rear headroom like in some many stylish, yet, impractical new cars.  Finally, and most importantly, SAFETY!  What good is the newest flashiest car on the market if you're dead or severely injured in a seemingly minor car accident? I saw it happen to many of my friends during high school and I was determined to buy a car that put a large emphasis on safety!

Repair Costs:

     There higher than average, but they are getting better.  Anybody who goes to buy a foreign car knows that parts and upkeep are going to be more expensive; the Volvo is no exception.

Snob Appeal:
     
     What I like about the Volvo is that it is not a snobby or flashy car.  It simply says that you have good sense and that you may be a bit worldlier than the average Joe.  What others think of you is relatively unimportant; you don't want people to judge you based on your car.

Practicality:

     The Swedes have always been practical and thoughtful in their designs.  The seats are the most comfortable I have ever sat in, period; and there is plenty of room in the cabin.  The trunk is generous with space and they (those crafty little Swedes) even put common sense items in like cargo tie-downs!  What this means is that you can drive with large items secured in your car and not have that loud "thump!" every time you accelerate and brake.  Memory seats are another nice touch with up to three preferences; other family members can drive it without having the inconvenience of finding the right seating position again.  Volvo also realizes that people like music, the sound system not only sounds good but is constructed with very durable speakers as well.  The engine, while not a barnstormer has more than adequate power for a family sedan.

<b>Safety:</b>

      Safety, by any means is Volvos' trademark.  For a car designed in 1993, the occupant protection systems are very advanced.  Here are some of those safety features:

-Automatically adjusting seatbelts with crash pretensioners (they reel in excess slack in a crash) and force limiters (limit the belts force on the occupant).

-Side Impact Protection System (SIPS).  

     The B-pillars are made of extremely thick metal that get wider as it gets closer to the base of the frame.  I once had the opportunity to see an 850 with its inner door cover off; the inside is all metal with beams.  Also, under the seats you will find these heavy steel pipes.  What I have been told they do is allow the seat to be pushed sideways into the SIPS box placed on the floor covered by the center console (in between the seats), effectively moving you more away from the door increasing the deceleration time, and therefore decreasing the force on your body.  The reason they need steel pipes to move the seat sideways is that if the seat didn't have them it could become "sandwiched" between the door and the center console, decreasing the width of the seat which would also "sandwich" you.  You will see that the doors themselves are free of any protruding objects that could impale you in such an accident.  The SIPS box is simply a metal box that allows the steel pipes to crash into it and let you move sideways, but at the same time it doesn't let you intrude or override the opposing seat.  

-Anti-Submarining Plates:

     Under the cushions of the seats and above the steel pipes you will feel these steel plates.  Volvo saw that in crash tests, the dummies were sliding under the seat belts, to fix this they needed to make a bottoming out point under the cushion, hence the steel plate.

-Knee Bolsters:

     The very bottom of the dash is where the knee bolsters are located.  Even though they appear to be hard plastic, given the right force they will buckle and cushion the knee in a frontal impact.  Need proof?  Go to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's web site (hwysafety.org) and check out the crash test results and photos, the 850 is a "best pick."


-Headrests:

     You know those little insubstantial stubs on top of the seats in some American cars?  Those are supposed to support your head in a car accident.  American manufacturers have made great strides in this area, but there is still room for improvement!  Volvo makes very large head restraints for all seating positions in their cars because they are what stand between you and a very serious neck injury!  Whenever you are in any car (Volvo or otherwise) always adjust your restraints properly, if you are in a major wreck you will thank yourself later.

-Dual Airbags:

     They are there for obvious reasons.

-Reinforced Roof:

     Some 850 owners complain of blind spots in their cars.  This is due to extra steel structure that is responsible for allowing the 850 to amass 6x its weight, that is nothing to sneeze at.  Your SUV driving friends will be jealous!

-Crumple Zones:

     Some areas of the car should crush, (The engine compartment, and trunk) others should not (the passenger compartment).  Volvo knows this and allows these structures that should collapse, do so in such a manner that the car ends up taking the crash energy, not you.

-Steel Reinforced Rear Seat Backs:

     Did you know that your luggage can actually kill you in a minor collision?  This is due to the fact that a single suitcase placed in the trunk can rip through the rear seats and enter the cabin with the force of a full-sized pick-up truck and strike passengers in the cabin.  That's what happens when you take a fifty-pound object and apply 40g's of force.  Volvo also found this out because they do real world crash tests in their safety laboratories.  So to prevent this from happening, they put metal plates in the back of the rear seats.

-Center Rear Child-Booster Seat:
 
     The center armrest in the rear opens into a booster seat for smaller children.  It is very convenient to have when you are taking kids somewhere and don?t want to have to mess with moving the booster seat from car to car.

-TRACS/ABS:

     This is a conjunction of Anti-lock Brakes and Traction Control to provide greater control and stability in adverse conditions.  Traction Control monitors each drive wheel for slippage via ABS wheel sensors; if slipping occurs during take-off the wheel is braked in the ABS mode, slowing the wheel to the point where it can regain traction.  ABS monitors all wheels on the car while braking and selectively pumps the brake of each wheel that locks-up.  This allows you to have maximum braking power while maintaining steering control.  I should also note that this is not one of the rudimentary systems you will find on some earlier American models, that kicks your foot off the brake every time the vehicle engages the ABS mode, it is rather sophisticated compared to other systems of the time.  

-Rear Fog Light:

     This feature lights up a lamp in the back of the car that is of the same intensity of the brake lights.  So the light won't be confused with your brakes, it is placed on only one side.  The Rear Fog Light allows other cars to see you in dense fog or other low-visibility situation.

*Note:  Side Impact airbags were available on 850s starting with the '95 model year.  It was the FIRST production car ever to have them!
 
Ride/Handling:

     The 850 doesn't have the best ride, it is rather rough on some roads, but it is tolerable.  Handling is excellent due to stiff shocks that don't promote body roll, squat or dive.  Road noise is average, it really depends on the kind of tires you have on the car.  The vehicle has a high belt line, which contributes to the tank-like feeling; the thick interior door panels also provide the same effect of solidity, isolation, and safety. 

Fit/Finish:

     As with all Volvos it is excellent.  Materials are not always top grade but they are put together well.  Wide panel gaps and cheap plastics are to a minimum.  

Value:

      Overall, the 850 is a great used car purchase because the resale value is so low.  Don't get me wrong 850s have their flaws and below I will list things to look out for when searching for any used 850/S70:

-Check and make sure the A/C system is working properly.  The evaporators often go and are an expensive fix.

-Check the color of the transmission fluid; it should be pinkish in color and shouldn't smell burnt.  If the fluid is dark/discolored move on!

-The Rear Main Seal is also another common maintenance item; have the car inspected for this before purchase.

-Make sure the previous owner has service records; a well cared for 850 will be good to you!

-NEVER EVER purchase any car, let alone a Volvo, without an inspection by a competent mechanic!  This doesn't mean that it will be problem free if the mechanic says its in good condition, but it can save you lots of $$$ down the road!

-Be religious about service!

Overall I love my car and I still drive it today when I get tired of feeling like a lemming in my Honda.  The car is more comfortable than just about any car I have ever sat in to this date.  Even though it has a ton of miles it is still a very reliable machine.  But, be forewarned, the 850 nor Volvos are for everyone; they are not as trouble free as Japanese models and they have their quirks.
