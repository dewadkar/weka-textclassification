            In the Fall of 1998 I bought a new 1999 Chevy Malibu.  It turned out to be one of my favorite cars.  I used it and abused it and it served me well.

My job required me to do quite a bit of driving and it was a pleasure in the Malibu.  In the two years I owned it, I put on just short of 100,000 miles.  That's a little less than 1000 miles a week so you know that I have a bit of experience with it.  As you might expect with that much mileage on a two year old car, I've also had experience with many cars.

Regrettably, it became a hood ornament for a full size Ford pickup that ran a red light, but that's another reason I loved this car.  I walked away from an accident that was extremely terrible with just some cracked ribs from the seatbelt and a scraped up knee where it hit the underside of the dash at impact.  

Here's the Breakdown:

<b>Cabin</b>

The first time in the car driving it off lot, I knew I would buy it.  The seats just felt right from the beginning.  I spend a lot of time in them, so this is very important.  The cabin is laid out well with everything easily at hand.  Radio controls are at easy reach.  There is a large storage bin under the armrest, which has storage space itself.  There is a cupholder built into the dash to the left of the steering wheel so you don't have to take your eyes off the road to find the handle on your travel mug.  There is adequate room in the back seat for extra travelers, but it also works well for my son in his carseat and amazing amounts of papers and Burger King containers.  There is also the interesting fact that the ignition is not on the steering column.  It is on the dash.  You can actually see it from your seat and don't have to look around the steering wheel to find it when you're not used to its placement when you first get the car.  If I didn't know better, I would think I was in a much higher priced car.

<b>Ride</b>

The Malibu's 3.1L Six provides enough power for whatever driving you want to (reasonably) do.  Merging into traffic is no problem and you can generally keep up with the big dogs with no problems.  The automatic transmission shifts smoothly and never seems to search for the right gear like on some of my previous vehicles.  Breaking also hits its mark.  Step on the pedal, and the car stops.  Quickly.  The only downfall of the ride is the steering.  I couldn't place it, but it just felt weak.  Grooves in the road can throw you back and forth a bit and sometimes bumps around corners seemed to throw me a little off track.  It wasn't much of a big deal, and I easily got used to it.  

<b>Durability</b>

This car only required regular maintenance while driving.  I did not have to bring it in once to be looked at for something other than routine stops.  Oil changes, tire rotations, and stuff like that were the only things needed.  My guess is that it would have kept going much longer if it wasn't for that big red truck.

<b>Trunk Space</b>

I had to mention trunk space.  For a car priced in this range, most that I saw had little econobox spots added to the back that they called a trunk.  This car had space and then some.  On one long trip to New York I was able to fit all of this into the trunk:  playpen, two adult suitcases, one baby suitcase, case of diapers, case of formula, stroller, backpack baby carrier, large picture in frame (gift), and two pairs of hiking boots.  The amazing part was that it fit easily.  No creative packing.

<b>Final Thought</b>
I liked this car.  I liked it a lot.  I actually missed it enough that when I was finally cut my insurance check by State Farm [Note:  avoid State Farm at all costs] I went out and bought a new 2000 model.
