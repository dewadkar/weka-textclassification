            The Toyota Celica is a <b>very</b> sexy sporty coupe that is also fun and practical to drive.  If you are considering a sports car but cannot afford a roadster like the Boxter or Corvette, the Celica is a good -- even better in some ways -- alternative.

According to car magazines the Celica is now in its 7th generation.  What this means to me is that it has had lots of refinements as well as improvements, and these show through when you drive it.  The transmission continues to be manual only, but it now feels more like you are driving a real sports car.  The 180-hp engine gives excellent acceleration.  Together with the improved transmission, I think the Celica is now no doubt the best sporty car to drive.  It's hard to describe in words the gratification here; you really have to drive the car yourself to see how well the powertrain works.

(Note: the less expensive GT comes with a less powerful engine.)

The Celica is a confident car on the road.  Steering is responsive and precise and makes you feel you are in total control, even at 100+.  The car handles nimbly on most road surfaces.  The ride is not only smooth but actually comfortable, an anomaly among sporty cars no doubt.  I wasn't bothered by the road noise, but those who are used to luxury sedans might be. Braking is also excellent, although I didn't get a chance to test it fully.

The inside of the Celica feels relative roomy for cars in this class.  As with other sports cars, don't expect to sit comfortably in the rear seats, but hey, you buy this car so you can drive it yourself, not sit in the back, right?  The rear seats can be folded down and used as practical cargo space.  But again, this is really a car to own so you can enjoy wild rides, not for picking up groceries.

The gauges are orange and, as with other Toyota vehicles, easy to read day or night.  The controls are reasonably placed and I have absolutely no complaints here.

I've heard that the Celica also boasts good fuel economy.  And it lives up to Toyota's reputation for quality: the car looks refined and everything is where it should be.  Online reports give this model high marks for reliability as well.

The Celica comes with seatbelts as well as front airbags, but once again, never drink and drive.

In summary, the Celica is a very fun vehicle to drive, and it handles both like a sports car and a small luxury car.  It's also stylish and you are guaranteed to get envious looks from other people.  If you are in the market for a sports coupe, you owe yourself to check out and test drive the Celica.  Once you do, I'm sure you'll fall in love with it.<br><br>
