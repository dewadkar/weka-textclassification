                The Honda CRV is a great car over all. It was based on the 4 wheel drive Civic produced only in Japan sadly. Making this car have a great engine. It also does pretty good MPG. We can usually do a 300 mile trip on a 12 gallon tank. The interior of the car is nice not very cramped as some would think from looking at the outside. It has a good sound system closely comparable to the Jeeps. It has 2 arm rests that you can push up to make a 3rd seat in the back. It has a great amount of cup holders which personally I can not get enough of. It revs nicely two but it is sometimes hard to pop in to 1st gear. Its also a speedy little car I find my self doing 50 down a road when I think I am doing 25. She is a pretty small SUV so you can go down cramped streets or fit in to a small parking space with room to spare making life a lot easier then with a Ford Excursion. The out side is a down fall it is not extremely good looking due to its sharp cut off at the back and mounted lights. If you want to spice up your Honda a great thing to buy would be a brush guard and fog lights. Another con of the Honda CRV is the cargo door it swings to the side not up like most cars making it annoying to use. Over all the Honda CRV is a great vehicle over all I highly recommend it.<br><br>
