            The S2000 was designed by Honda to be a cheap sports car that goes 0-60 mph in about 5 seconds. The S2000 produces 240 hp and 153 lbs of torque making this speedy Honda comparable to the BMW M roadster, but yet at an affordable price. It is pretty hard to find one these popular cars now though. They are being sold at about 10k over market value because of their popularity. They should run about 35k but they are being sold at 45k. This price will go down in the future when more S2000's are made. This car redlines at about 9000 rpm. The car not only runs great but looks great as well. It has a sporty design that seats two and also comes in a convertible. As with most Honda's the S2000 has a relatively small 2 liter engine. Because of the small engine the car has to reved pretty hard to produce its maximum power. Although the car does reach these high speeds quickly with its six speed gear box. This car is definitely for those who want a fast cheap sports car.<br><br>
