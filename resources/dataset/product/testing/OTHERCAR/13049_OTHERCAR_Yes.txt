            I bought my SE 2-door in March of 1999 for $6,900 from a Chevy dealer.  It had 42000 miles.

I now have over 98000 miles and this is my opinion of the car:
The thermostat needed replacing because the engine didn't warm up.  This was easily done myself with the help of a Haynes repair manual.  I replaced both front and rear brakes.  They weren't worn out but they squealed.  I got lifetime warranty pads and had my father-in-law help me put them on.  It was a simple process with the right tools.  The alternator went at 85000 miles. I got an alignment done and this cured a steering wheel shimmy. I replaced the coolant myself at 90000 miles for preventative maintenance.

The car rides very well, has good power from the 3.1 engine, and is quiet.  All the power accessories work perfectly except for the front power seat switch.  It handles well, and is comfortable on long drives.  The seats are getting a little worn but are still supportive. The transmission shifts very smoothly still.  The car feels like it will last at least another 50,000- 100,000 miles.

I feel like the car has been a good value and that the maintenance that has been done is minimal with minimal cost.  I get about 20mpg city and 30-32 highway.  

I would recommend this car to anyone on tight budget and who does a lot of highway driving.
