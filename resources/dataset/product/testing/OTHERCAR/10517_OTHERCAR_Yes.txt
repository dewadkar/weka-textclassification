            When looking for an automobile, I decided I wanted a 4 door sedan, but I wanted a luxury automobile too.  I narrowed my choices to the Infinity I30, the Lexus ES300, and the Acura 3.2TL.  After over a month of research, I decided to get the Acura TL.  The TL has all of the components that you would expect to find in a luxury car.  Leather seats, wood accent paneling, power sunroof, power....everything.  The home link system allows you to program the car so that you don't need to carry around all of those bulky clickers.  The trunk is huge and has a slide through opening which allows for longer items such as a fishing rod.  There is a cargo net to help secure more fragile items.  There is a Bose stereo system with CD and tape cassette players and there is even a storage area for your CDs.  Best of all, these are all STANDARD on the Acura TL.  That's a lot of bang for your buck.

There is really only one upgrade for this car and that is the on-board navigation system.  Besides buying the upgrade, you also have to subscribe to the service.  For some people this is a selling feature, but it is an individual preference.

Besides being so full of amenities, the car is beautiful to look at.  It's sleek design sets it apart from some of the other luxury sedans.  With it's great selection of exterior and interior colors, that was the hardest part of finishing the purchase.
