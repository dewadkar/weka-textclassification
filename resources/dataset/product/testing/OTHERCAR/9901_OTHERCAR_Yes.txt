            I Bought my Dodge Dakota Sport as a Demo car it had some scratches on it and I got it at about 27,000 Miles. I still own it and am currently trying to sell it it has 70,000 miles I haven't had one problem with it at all and it is still worth nearly what I bought it for. This is a great pickup for someone who doesn't want to spend the $34,000 for a big truck and yet it is still bigger than your small trucks. I pulled a small fishing boat down to Stockton Lake, MO from Kansas City, MO about a 3 hour trip I only had to fill up once I got 22 miles to the gallon. Not bad for a truck pulling a boat. It is also small enough that its not as hard to get around the city or in parking lots. I am only selling mine because I want to get a 2001 Car. I would own another Dakota in a heart beat. Test drive one and tell me what you think. <br><br>
