            Last year I was about to have our 3rd child and needed a vehicle that would fit three car seats comfortably in the seat behind the driver.  My children still required/needed car seats and I wasn't ready to alienate my oldest to the rear...plus I just don't throw that well.  The Montana provided an option to have three second row bucket seats that would fit three very different and all big-sized car seats.  That makes driving with my very young crew much more manageable.  

I was a very hard sell in regards to purchasing a minivan...I didn't like the ride or look of a minivan.  I test drove almost every model(nine months pregnant therefore extremely discriminating).  The Montana had the most of everything that I was looking for.  The drive itself was much tighter than many of the other minivans out there.  It corned well and didn't give you that &quot;floating&quot; effect.  It has a great deal of pick-up even when the air is on.  I live in Colorado and was impressed with its performance in the mountains and in the snow.  The safety features of the Montana were also reassuring.  The minivan has front and side airbags and all the doors including the rear are very solid.

The van I bought didn't have a whole lot of extras, though there was a power sliding side door I was not excited about at first.  The amount of force it takes to stop the door if one of the kids were caught somehow would most likely hurt them a great deal.  So far we haven't had to take that test.  The Montana gets about 18 City mpg and 24ish mpg on the highway.  Mechanically speaking in the past year there has been no problems.  The interior plastic is really cheap - both of the second row door guides popped out and now are a complete nuisance.

The space in the minivan is a big plus.  The seats are incredibly easy to maneuver and directions are clearly displayed and easy to understand.  The seats lock in position and are very sturdy as well as comfortable.  I like the space it provides even with all the kids buckled in and that's just the regular size Montana and not the extended version.  My husband is six foot four inches and is very comfortable in the driver's or passenger's seat.

All in all as a used-to-be minivan hater this was a great choice for my family.  The Montana is affordable, reliable, spacious and a decent ride.  If you really don't want to buy a minivan but it just makes too much sense to have one; then you'll probably like the Montana.  It's a sporty look with a somewhat car-like ride with all the convenience, comfort and gizmos a minivan should have.
