            <b>A 4-seat convertible with power everything for under $15k?</b>  
I didn't think it was possible either until I discovered the Cavalier Convertible. 

This car is a superb value for both the young and young at heart. Don't worry about the lack of a V-6 option, 150 horses is <i>plenty</i> of power for a car this size. Acceleration is strong, cornering good, and the CD player even automatically adjusts the volume to compensate for changes in engine noise. The back seats aren�t huge but fine for short trips. Raising and lowering the powered top couldn�t be easier.

It's good, but not perfect: Big, heavy doors will cause even the cautious owner to occasionally leave door marks on neighboring cars. The center console storage bin is 1/2" too small to hold a CD in its case, and the glovebox doesn't lock. GM engineered an impressive automatic top, but could only find space for one cupholder. Seats and steering wheel ergonomics could use improvement. Despite these design flaws, the car is a fantastic value and highly recommended.
