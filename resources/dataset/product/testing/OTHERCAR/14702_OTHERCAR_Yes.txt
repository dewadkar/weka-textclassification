            I was looking for a car I could trust to keep my new family safe from harms way. I found the security I was looking for in the 1999 Subaru Forester L. 

My wife and I looked at all the available vehicles in this class including the Honda CRV and the Toyota RAV4. We also drove 4 door sedans like the Honda Civic. Hands down the Subaru Forester was the car to buy. 

The Forester is the only SUV I know that handles like a car. When I want to pass or accelerate the car immediately responds and you need have no fear of roll over, this one is not top heavy. Believe me, on the test drive I tried to expose problems in the car. In an empty parking lot I really stood on the brakes to test emergency braking. The Forester stopped straight and true. In a local river bed the car was �sure footed� and climbed right out without a hitch. In the key test, for me, of roll and sway the Forester was stable and rock solid. 

I would recommend the Subaru Forester L to anyone looking for a vehicle they can trust and depend on in a wide variety of driving conditions.<br><br>
