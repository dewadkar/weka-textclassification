            What more can I say?  This is the best car I have ever owned.  It runs great and gets good gas mileage.  I can also get my daughter's car seat in relatively easily; it's much easier to put a car seat in my Breeze than it was to put it in my last car. My Breeze has comfy seats and lots of leg room.  Speaking of room, the back seats are good sized so the person who sits there doesn't have to dig their knees into the seat in front of them.  And the trunk....I can't believe how big it is.  I can actually fit all of my luggage in it when I go on a road trip.  It also has a great sound system.  The radio is easy to operate and sounds great!

Probably the best thing about my Breeze is the way it handles.  It has enough power to merge into traffic smoothly without getting run into.  That is very important to me.  I don't like cars who take 5 miles to get up enough speed to go with the flow of traffic on the freeway.  Thankfully my Breeze isn't like that.  And once I get going, my Breeze drives very smoothly...like driving on a cloud.  <br><br>
