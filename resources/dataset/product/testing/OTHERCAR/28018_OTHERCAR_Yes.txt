            I bought my Grand Am used with only 13,000 miles on it with the lease with option to buy plan.  I loved my car from day one!  It was red with 4 doors, a standard SE edition.  I noticed that when I bought the car there was a tapping on my foot when I hit the brakes.  My brother-in-law confirmed that it was warped rotors.  This didn't take too long to happen, maybe 2 weeks after I bought it.  I took it in to the shop and had the brakes and rotors changed.  Then I had to bring it in again in 6 months.  My mechanic ribbed me that I drove with my foot on the pedal, which is not accurate.  He changed the brakes again, with the rotors AGAIN, along with the calipers in the next 9 months!  This was becoming annoying.  I accepted the fact that my purty little car was hard on brakes. I had 2 problems when I went to the automatic car wash that has you get out while they run it through.  I was standing there watching my car being washed when one of the large brushes ripped off my driver door mirror.  They stopped the car wash and attended to my mirror.  The owner said that he dreaded Grand Am's coming into his business because he had to replace the mirrors at least once a week.  He said that Pontiac should recall the cars and change all of the mirrors.  He replaced mine at no cost.  A year later the other one was ripped off the passenger door.  Again, it had to be replaced.  Other than that the only time it was in the shop was when a cat climbed up into the engine one morning.  I started the car and heard a screeching noise and a thump.  Take heart, Cat lovers!  The kitty didn't die by some miracle.  It hobbled away and scampered off into the morning, leaving me with a broken serpentine belt.  At least it had 8 more lives to live and more serpentine belts to destroy.  But at least the cat lived.  Also, the back doors on both sides had issues with the vinyl padding coming away from the doors.  It didn't look too good.  My car was almost paid off when I was in an accident on the turnpike.  I hit a sheet of rain going 60 mph and I hydroplaned.  I thought I had control of the car but it started to spin out of control.  I don't know how fast I was going when I actually hit the median of the Turnpike but I hit it HARD!  It was the back drivers side that hit first.  Amazingly enough I was able to start the car back up (the engine shut off on impact) and drive it to the nearest exit ramp that was about a mile away).  I wasn't brave enough to get out and survey the damage when I hit the median because I was lucky enough to have lived hitting it that hard but I didn't want to test my luck by getting out and being splatted by a semi truck.  The rain came on so suddenly that it was difficult to see anyway.  So I drive up to the exit and I told my husband that the damage was going to be bad and to prepare himself.  When I got out and look I thought I was going to faint!  THE ENTIRE BACK OF MY CAR WAS GONE! I had no bumper, no tail lights, nothing!  It look like it was raped by some terrible metal eating monster!  Wires were hanging from every direction!  Turnpike workers pulled into the exit a little bit later and gave us the pieces to our car back.  I was stunned to see so much damage to the back end and realized that we were lucky to do a few 360's, hit a wall with a previous speed of 60 mph and walk away!  The rest of my car was in PERFECT shape, not a scratch on it.  Actually, the car drove pretty awesome from the accident site.  This just made my faith in Pontiac grow even more.  If I had been driving something else I might not be sitting here writing this review.  My next car will be another Grand Am or, if my husband has his way, I will have a GRAND PRIX!  Yippee!
