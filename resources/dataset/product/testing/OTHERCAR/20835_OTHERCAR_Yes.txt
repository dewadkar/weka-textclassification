            With the dawning of the 21st century at hand, car companies are seeking to diversify their selections.  And the environment-friendly vehicles lead the fad.  The Toyota Prius is one of them, as well as one of the best; so here we go...!

I talked my classmate into a test drive of his new prius; I was just aching to see, no, <b>experience</b>, the hybrid car from Toyota.  The engine switches from electric to gas as your driving, and the change is hardly noticeable.  The ride is quiet and the seats are comfortable.  And the usual Toyota cabin quality isn't sacrificed at all in this hybrid.  The mileage is also very attractive, around 40-42 mpg.

And for a gas/electric car, the Prius has a lot of seats!  It's a four-door, 2 in front, 3 in back, headroom monster!  The trunk is also adequate, fitting about 3-4 suitcases or two golf bags.  

The passenger experience is pleasant and relaxing.  There is hardly any body roll, and the ride is smooth and like I said before, very quiet.  The handling is fair, and compared to some nimble Honda's, stiff, but it doesn't really bother me at all.

For looks, I would say that the Prius is nice.  It doesn't really yell &quot;Look at me!!&quot; like the new bug yet it does stand out in the crowd.  Some people will notice you're driving the new Toyota Prius, efficient gas/electric... so this car will turn some heads.

Overall, the Toyota Prius is above the game.  It has great performance and, based on the Camry and Corolla, excellent predictable reliability.  The mileage is also impressive, and riding in the Prius is a dream.  So if you're on the market for an efficient, environment-saving small sedan, check out the Toyota Prius.  With all these features it's an all-around family car.<br><br>
