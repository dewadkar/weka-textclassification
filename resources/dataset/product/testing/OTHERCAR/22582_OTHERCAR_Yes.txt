            I have now owned two of these great cars and i have no complaints. They run strong and look great. The car gets plenty of attention and is really worth buying. Lots of performance out of any engine offered in this car, even the 3.1 V6 screams. Perfect summer car, t-tops, comfortable seats great handling and a powerful engine (that doesnt get the greatest mileage), a wonderful cruising car. Come winter time though I would advise having another car available, besides the fact that it is a high powered, rear wheel drive car, it also sits very low to the ground and in more than a few inches of snow i am afraid you would have trouble getting around.<br><br>
