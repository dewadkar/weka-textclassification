            Our 1999 Saturn SL2 has been an extremely reliable car for my four-member family. The car has been in Saturn's repair shop only twice since we purchased it in 1999. Once in 1999 it was in because of a hairline-crack on the engine head that was leaking oil. The car apparently left the factory that way, but after that manufacture defect was replaced all was solved. In Jan. '02 the car went in again to have a belt replaced due to normal wear and tear. Other than that the car has not been in the shop for anything more major than an oil change or a recommended tune-up.

Our Saturn has a manual transmission with a 16 valve, Quad 4 engine. Therefore, the car runs like a 6 cylinder but has the gas mileage of a 4 cylinder. The engine parts under the hood are not crowded together, making it easy for things to be replaced or repaired by the auto hobbyist or mechanic. The trunk has a lot of space and the rear seat backs drop down allowing for additional trunk room.

Having owned the car for three years now, there are a few cons that we have found with the car. First, people who are 5'10" and up will not have enough leg room, especially if they are riding as passengers either in the front or the back of the car. Second, if you opt not to have the Sony stereo installed in the car you will want to put a new stereo in the car because the factory installed stereo is not very good quality. Third, if you do your own oil changes make sure that you have jack stands for the car. The car is so low to the ground that it has to be jacked up in order to access the oil filter and plug underneath the car. Fourth, when traveling in the car with the windows up you can still hear quite a bit of road noise from the car driving. And fifth, the car barely holds any resale value so make sure to buy as many options as affordable at the onset of your purchase in order to maximize the car's resale value.

Overall, my family and I are very pleased with our Saturn. It has been a very dependable car for us. Saturn cars give you a lot of value for their cost.
