            The 4Runner's strong suit is its refinement.  Very quiet and smooth for a SUV.

The 4Runner's weakness is its gas mileage, especially in V6 trim.  This is compounded by its rather small gas tank.

Excellent: ergonomics, stereo, features (like the roll down rear glass and two-turns of the door key to unlock all the doors), superior resale value, styling, handling, dependability, visibility and turning radius (for an SUV).  BONUS:  Where I live, 4Runners are babe-magnets!

Weaknesses:  Gas mileage/useful range on a tank of gas, smaller than an Explorer, limited interior storage, very pricey for what you get.  Wish they'd get rid of the stupid antenna (mount it in the glass like the Camry).

I am constantly amazed at how well these things sell.  One of my sedan-friends asked me why I liked it so much so I pulled it up next to her car.  It had a shorter overall length which made parking a lot easier, the seating position gave me a command of the road.  And it had more useable interior room than her sedan.  (I didn't expound upon the babe-magnet virtues - some things are just not worth explaining.)

As far as mid-size SUVs go, this one is the best, if you can afford it.
