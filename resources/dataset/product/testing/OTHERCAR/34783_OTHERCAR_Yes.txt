            The Mitsubishi Montero 2000 is, while not the most innovative car, &quot;stylish&quot;, sleekly designed, sturdy and efficient. It doesn't have many features to hold above the heads of its competition but it is a solidly built, well focused 4-wheel drive vehicle.

<b>The Design and Interior</b>
The dashboard and controls are very easy to use and well placed. Knobs and buttons are marked with icons that make them easy to identify and they are all placed in accessible positions. There is a second gear shift next to the automatic stick allowing you to change from 2-wheel drive to 4-wheel drive when in neutral. There is also a nice sized glove compartment and the rear view mirror is equipped with a sensor for temperature and compass. 

There are three ceiling compartments in which you can store your sun glasses, credit cards and a remote control for the garage if you have one. The seats are of average comfort. There is a button that will move the seat back and forth, then there is one that will flatten it out nearly horizontal. The drivers seat features a lumbar cushion that will rise or deflate with the touch of a button.

Getting into the car you will most likely bump your head the first 50 times. The ceiling is a little low near the door. In the back, for added storage room, you can flatten or remove the back seats very easily.

There is a cd player but the speakers could be stronger and better placed. They sit in awkward spots and are not very powerful. 

<b>Performance</b>
Like most modern SUV's the Mitsubishi Montero is equipped with power steering and breaks with the ABS (automatic breaking system).  It is very smooth and controllable even at speeds excess of 90 mph and the cruise control, conveniently located near the right side of the steering wheel is easy to use and reliable.

One problem that it seems to have when its raining is hydroplaning. It seems to hydroplane more than normal and it appears to be more prone to toppling not only because of its structure but because the car manual says so.

The side view mirrors are nice and large giving you a great viewing advantage yet they sometimes seem to work like big Dumbo ears because they are flat and wide.  They seem to give an affect of wind breakers and the wind is loud whipping around them.

It is definitely a beautiful car but I don't see very many special things that would make it a must have or high recommendation. It seems more like a year 2000 rehash of what has already been done. Not bad but just not <i>bad</i>.<br><br>
