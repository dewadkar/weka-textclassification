            I bought my '95 Del Sol new and have owned it now for  over 6 years. I would purchase this car all over again. It is very reliable and has never given me any trouble. I have 97,000 miles on it now and the only repairs I've done are scheduled maintenance. One of the drawbacks though is it's hydroplaning. The car is very light and has an aluminum top. At the slightest amount of rain, it will hydroplane. I have tried 3 different sets of tires, even the ones with the big groove down the center (specially for rain) and nothing helps. I have just learned to adapt by braking early in wet conditions. Having no anti-lock brakes doesn't help either (I have the Si model). I would recommend this car to anyone and hope to get at least another 4 years use out of it before purchasing another Honda.
