            Where do I start?  

We found out we were having a baby.  "MUST GET FAMILY CAR... MUST GET FAMILY CAR.."  I was driving a 1987 Nissan Sentra (which I SHOULD have kept) and my husband drives a 1996 F-150 Pick-up.  Who lost their car?  Me, of course.

Anyway, on to the point... We went to the dealership (which is also part of the problem...) and to make a long story short we SETTLED, yes, settled, for the 2000 Malibu.  A friend of my husband had nothing but GREAT things to say.  His must be a SPECIAL model... a one in a million, if you will.  

Three days after we had it, the A/C doesn't work, the Engine is making horrible sounds (which still hasn't been repaired - if I could tell you to avoid dealerships, I'd steer you away from the one we went to) and every once in a while, like on the Thruway, or when I have the baby in the car.. it feels like it's uttering it's last breaths.  I'm so upset with this car, I haven't even NAMED it... and that's an atrocity in my family.

And room for 5??? What, lab rats?  Or circus clowns?  Small children?  My husband and I are glad that we finally figured out how to stop bumping elbows when we're in the front seat.. and we're not giants, or anything.  

The trunk is not as roomy as you are led to believe, but it looks big.  Try fitting just a regular stroller and your diaper bag in there recently?

The interior is easy enough to spot clean.  The radio is strange, but it has a lot of power to it.  The dials for A/C and heat and defrost are pretty easily accessible.  

I would say spend the few extra bucks for the Impala or the Lumina or whatever...  or else (shh! Don't tell my dad) buy foreign.  I hear the Altima's are REALLY nice.
