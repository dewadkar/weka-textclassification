            I saw all the hype for the Xterra and decided that I had to have one.  I went online and ordered the vehicle and within two weeks, I drove down from Dallas with my new Xterra SE.  It was a great feeling to finally be part of the &quot;new standard&quot; of SUV's, little did I know that it would not be so glamorous.  

The vehicle has a unique styling and design, that must be credited to it.  The build quality is great and you have a great feeling that the vehicle will last some time.  The seats are too soft for long trips. Comfort is not helped with the low seating position for the seats.  It feels like you are sitting on the floor with you feet forward.  The useless sunroof is a big disappointment.  In order to lift the pop-up sunroof, you must take off the cargo basket from the roof.  This still does not allow you to get much sunlight because of the stylish air dam in the front.  I dont quite understand why the vehicle optioned out for  a stereo upgrade of this nature.  There was no rear dynamics for the system.  I even took it through some mud to test out its capabilities.  That was sadly a BIG disappointment for me.  The vehicle got stuck in two inches of mud.  It took me an hour to pry it out of the mess.  The cause of this was the skinny tires that are on the vehicle.  That with the weight balance did not help the cause.  If you decide to go off-roading, I would HIGHLY recommend purchasing the 4WD option.  It is a must if you decide not to stay on paved road.  

My other problem has been fuel consumption.  If I decide to drive the vehicle rough, I will pay for it in the pocket.  I have average about 240 miles before the refill light comes on.  That is not a good thing when you are running around a lot.  It is not too much better on the highway.  The engine has 170hp, but at times it does not come easily on tap, you will have to squeeze the juice out of it.  

I do enjoy the truck in its styling.  I have even fixed it up with all the factory accessories and some after market stuff, such as a 12-speaker stereo system and brush guards.  I kept the &quot;factory&quot; look, but I could not use it as my personal vehicle.  Perhaps because I live in Texas, I did not get the truck respect.  I handed the vehicle off to my younger sister to take to college.  Its a big hit with her group.  If Gen-X wants a truck, I say to look elsewhere like I did, but if you want the SUV look the Xterra is something to think about.<br><br>
