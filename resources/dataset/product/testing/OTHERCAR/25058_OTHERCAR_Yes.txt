              I finally took the plunge last month into digital photography and am I pleased with my choice of equipment!
I had been borrowing a Sony Mavica for the last year from my work so I was familiar with what I DIDN'T want in a digital camera. After doing about three months of research I finally decided on the DC4800 out of all other 3+ megapixel cameras. Why?

  First, PRICE, PRICE, PRICE! The bottom line is this camera, when purchased the way I purchased it was simply the best deal out there (search www.pricegrabber.com or www.mysimon.com).

  Second, EASE OF USE. What good is a camera if you're constantly fiddling with the menu and missing great shots? KODAK has wisely placed frequently adjusted controls outside of the menu system where they operate just like a regular film camera, ie., under/over exposure adjustment, flash selection, f-stop adjustment, macro/infinity focus, self-timer and burst mode (this acts like a motor drive).

  Third, BUILD QUALITY. Most of the cameras I handled at the local superstore were quite flimsy feeling in my hands. I mean c'mon, you're plunking down a SIGNIFICANT amount of cash for an item that will be bumped and jostled about frequently and it better hold up, considering what you paid for it! This camera is SOLID and well laid out. The majority of the housing is METAL and where it is plastic it is HEAVY plastic. I won't name names here, but N***N and O*****S could improve their build quality, especially when their cameras are 200.00 more!!

  Fourth, FEATURES or the lack thereof! Who needs video capabilities, especially at the CHEESY resolutions provided on most cameras? I have a video camera for that! The menu system on this camera is very easy to navigate and use, CLEAR and CONCISE. The 3X OPTICAL zoom is tremendous(there is also a 2X digital zoom) and the WIDE-ANGLE capabilities of this camera are superb, equivalent to 28mm on a standard camera! I can get more of an overall view with this little gem than any other model I tried.
(Who needs a PANORAMA feature?)

Remember, extras add to the final cost, and most are "gimmicky" at best. Kodak also INCLUDES a rechargeable battery and AC adapter with the DC4800 something sadly missing from most models costing much more. The package I bought also included a 64 mb CF card AND an extra battery, must haves in my opinion!

   Fifth and final, PICTURE QUALITY. All I can say is WOW!!!!! There may be cameras out there in the same megapixel range that supposedly produce better pictures than the DC4800, but they are more expensive and harder to use. The DC4800 is very consistent in the pictures it produces and in my opinion is much more of an everyday camera than the others. There are settings for sharpness, color saturation, B/W with red and yellow filters plus the really cool Sepia setting! This camera makes beautiful print photos up to 11"x 14" that are indistinguishable from those taken with a standard 35mm. The feature set that KODAK has developed for the DC4800 gives you all the creative flexibility you could ever hope for along with being a terrific point-and-shooter! To all the detractors out there who are ready "throw in the towel" with this model I must say that you have not LEARNED the camera! The firmware upgrade is a MUST http://www.kodak.com/global/en/service/software/dc4800/navigation.shtml) and the the amount of tweaking you need to do for certain shots can be tedious if you're easily frustrated, The flash may be a little weak in some peoples' opinions, but but beyond 10-12 feet (which is what this camera's flash is rated for) you'd cook anything closer!! In my final summation this is the best camera for the money out there, get one for yourself!!!

PS.
Sam's Club has the Kodak dc4800EZ (#972336) for $479.95!!!
Buy.com sells this for $725.95.

The EZ package adds an extra lithium battery and upgrades the Compact Flash from 16mb to 64mb. Normally the Non-EZ package sells around $525-$599.

So you get the 3.1 Megapixel Camera, an extra battery (a $49.95 value), and an additional 48mb of compact flash memory (a $75 value).

But wait there is more...
Inside the box is a registration card, which includes a free lens adapter (a $25 value), when you register.
