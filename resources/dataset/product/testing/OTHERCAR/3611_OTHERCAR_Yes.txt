            This is a luxury SUV without the luxury price. After driving a Blazer loaned to us by a local dealer &amp; driving a Lexus RX300 we decided to have one last look at the Jimmy's. My husband &amp; I have always preferred the look of the Jimmy's over the Blazers. We noticed a brand new Envoy. The Envoy is basically a &quot;fancy&quot; Jimmy. And it is a nice step up &amp; not much increase in price for all the added features. 
This Envoy is Monterey Maroon Metallic with gold lettering &amp; causes you to notice it. Stepping in for the test drive we were immediately drawn to the 2 tone gray leather seats with Envoy stitched on the headrests. The warm toned wood trim on the shifter &amp; window controls is the perfect touch of elegance.After the test drive we decided right then, that if the Envoy was as &quot;cheap&quot; as the Blazer we were driving, we would get it instead. There is a current added incentive to buy the Envoy &amp; we also have the GM loyalty certificate &amp; it turned out to be cheaper than the Blazer &amp; have more options &amp; is high on luxury.

The 6 disc Bose Am/fm cassette is wonderful. But, the added bonus is the rear headjacks. These are for the rear passengers to take advantage of. They can listen to tape, cd or radio as long as the front passengers are not already. My kids can jam away on Toy Story tunes or Backstreet Boys &amp; we don't have to hear it! 

The additional features just keep piling up.

The on-board air compressor is handy for those &quot;emergency&quot; basketball inflations at the park or rafts for the pool. The electronic push button folding side mirrors are oh-so nice&amp; convenient for drive thru car washes!

I especially like the feature that raises or lowers your radio volume automatically when you accelerate or decelerate &amp; the radio controls on the steering wheel. My husband likes the concealed heavy duty towing hitch &amp; the push button Autotrac system for automatic 4x4 &amp; all wheel drive. 

The roof rack is included if you don't opt for a sunroof.
 
It has all the bells &amp; whistles...AC,PWR seats, rear defrost, rear wiper, cruise, steering wheel radio controls (you don't have to take your eyes off the road to change the station or volume), &amp; tinted windows.
The 4 dr, all wheel drive Envoy is recommended by me for families of up to 5. It has nice power due to its' Vortec V6 engine. This is a nice vehicle-period. Run to your nearest GMC dealer &amp; drive one, you will be hooked!
