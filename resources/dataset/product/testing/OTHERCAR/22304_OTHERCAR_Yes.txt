            OK, need to update you folks on some info on the MPV.  1st of all, my wife has received two, yes two, recall notices for the MPV.  One recall notice is for the Cruise Control.  Seems that there might be a problem where you go to dis-engage the Cruise Control and it doesn't.  Reports show that this has lead to the death of 5 people.  Also, my wife has had her MPV into the shop 6 times in the last 7 months for engine problems.  Each time, the garage found a problem but didn't fix the problem she was having (seems her check engine light would always come on).  The opinion below just beems about the MPV but now that the car has been on the road for a year now, seems the may not be as mechanically sound as I first thought.  Keep checking back to get updates.

***THE BELOW OPINION WAS WRITTEN ON JULY 17, 2000***
I feel that this is the Mini-van that doesn't feel like a mini-van.  My ex-wife and I bought our MPV in August 1999.  At the time we looked at the Mercury Villager/Nissan Quest, the Chrysler line of mini-vans as well as the Ford Winstar.  The MPV rode just as nice as the more expensive mini-vans but handled better.  To me it felt more like a car than a van.  The mini-van has very good sight lines and you can see around well.  Our (or I should now say her) model was the ES (top of the line) with leather interior, Power Moon roof (huge moon roof; second row of seats can actually enjoy it too!).  The second row of seats can either be set apart or slide together to form a bench seat.  Unlike the Mini-vans mentioned above, with the MPV you can actually take your third seat out keep it with you.  Well sort of, unlike most mini-vans, when you want to expand your cargo area, you simply fold the 3rd seat into the floor and take it with you.  This came in very handy on a road trip across the country.  We had Christmas presents and luggage in the back while we were on the road.  Once we got to where we were going, we unloaded, and folded the seat and could once again carry 7 people.  That would not of been possible with the Village/Quest.  The factory sound system is the best factory system I have every heard.  The 9 speakers fill up the cabinet area nicely.  The 6-disk IN DASH CD play is a nice touch too.

As for gas mileage, it is fair (comparable to most 6 cylinder mini-vans).  The engine in the 2000 model could use a little more get up and go.  I find it sluggish when passing a car on the interstate.  I do understand that Mazda could be putting a more powerful engine in the 2001 edition.  

I like this Mini-van so much that I can't wait until the Tribute (Mazda's new SUV) is released to see if it is as good as the MPV.  Would I buy another one?  Oh yes.<br><br>
