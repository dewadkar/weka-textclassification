            I bought a black 1999 Pontiac Grand Am coupe in August of 1998.  It was one of the very first cars off the assembly line from Lansing (I live in Michigan).  Since then, I have put 34,000 miles on it to date.  I originally bought the car due to its sporty and racy looks; I was impressed by the &quot;get up and go&quot; of the car, not to mention the really cool design that appealed to this woman driver!
  Here is the Goods about this car so far:  I love the handling, looks, ease-of-driving, and horsepower of this car!  It can really move when you want it to!  The interior is nicely arranged, with everything an easy reach for the driver. The stereo (I have the CD player w/EQ) cranks and so far I have not had any trouble w/skipping.  I particularly love the automatic locking of the doors whenever the car starts or when it moves forward.  The car's computer sensor system is wonderful--it even tells you when the tires are low, and when the oil needs to be changed (these are important features for us women!) The backseat is roomy enough for two passengers.
  The Bads:  I was quite disappointed with the tires on this car.  They are Goodyear GTs (sport wheels) and I found that the tread wore down quickly.  I have already had to replace the two front tires, and these tires are not cheap! Average cost is $160 per tire. Also my alternator died at 17,000 miles, and my battery had to be replaced at 33,000 miles. The backseat is hard to access due to the little room there is when the front seat is tilted forward.  The seat locking mechanisms are cheap and I had to have my driver's side lock replaced at 18,000 miles.  Overall, I still enjoy my Grand Am, but I do think there are some quality issues to be aware of.<br><br>
