            I cannot say enough nice things about this car.  Almost everyone in my family drives a Toyota, so it was only natural for my husband and I to buy one for ourselves.  We had a Honda Civic LX before our purchase, and we loved that car, but the miles were too high.  We went into the market for a new car as soon as I found out I was pregnant.  We really wanted a safe, reliable car to take our newborn home in.  What we wanted is surely what we got in this car and so much more!

I love the way this car handles the road.  Also, the ride is so smooth, I really love to ride in this car.  The only disadvantage this car has is the back seat space and the trunk space.  But other than that, this car is well worth the price tag!<br><br>
