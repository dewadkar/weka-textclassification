            I purchased my 1996 Lincoln in Oct 2000, as a second car to use for commuting back and forth to work and to business meetings. Since I have 3 kids, and my wife was against my getting a Mustang, the Lincoln was my choice. The 4.6 Liter Intech V-8 gets close to 25 MPG, and it packs a punch. The engine has 4 camshafts that produce quiet and reliable power. The dual exhaust is nicely tuned and the ride is relatively quiet, but the car could have been equipped with a beefier transmission. I've been told that Lincoln used the same front wheel drive transmission as the Ford Taurus, which is not a bad thing, but I feel that it limits this car's full horsepower potential. The Continental also comes equipped with an air ride self-adjusting suspension system
that has 3 settings (Plush, Normal, or Firm). I personally prefer the Firm setting, as the other settings seem to add a lot of bounce to the ride. This car does handle pretty well for a big car, and 0 to 60 acceleration can be done in under 8 seconds. The JBL stereo system is okay, but I would have preferred something a little more robust. The stereo settings of Jazz, Rock, Stadium, Concert Hall, etc. don't really do anything for me; an equalizer would have been a better choice. The instrument panel gauges are nicely illuminated and easy to see. The leather interior comfortably seats four adults, but can seat five if needed. There is ample truck room to fit any size luggage or a lot of groceries. The body styling is aero-dynamic and sleek, and is nicely complimented with the factory alloy wheels.
These cars originally sold for $41,000 in 1996, so anytime you can scoop one up for under $15,000, you've gotten a good buy. I can't comment on how expensive it is to maintain yet, as all of the routine maintenance has been done by the dealership at no cost. I have heard, however, that the air suspension is pretty expensive to replace. Other than that, this is a nice looking solid luxury car with the performance to back it up.
