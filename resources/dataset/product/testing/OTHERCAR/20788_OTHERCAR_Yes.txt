            I have a 93 S-10 Tahoe LT blazer. 4WD fully loaded. I love it!!! It is a rebuilder but it runs like a dream. It is very spacey and makes a good family vehicle. I handles very well on the road and is comfortable to ride in. The only problem I have found with the blazers are that they have transmission problems. Especially when they have overdrive in them. My blazer is on its 3 transmission so far.   I would recommend the blazer for people with children, I feel safer in it with my small children then I did in a small car.  I also like the toggle switch for the 4WD. It is much handier than the regular.  The blazer also offers many handy storage compartment for travelers. I highly recommend the chevy blazer s-10's.<br><br>
