            OK, I had wanted a digital camera for a long time.  So I found a web design job online that was for a computer company.  As payment for the work I did, they gave me a laptop.  Now, I have other computers, so I decided to sell it because I really wanted a digital camera.  So I sell my laptop online for $900.  Then, at my sister's going away party (she was moving to London), I decided to quickly run out and buy this camera so I could have pictures.  That was about a year and a half ago, and the camera cost me $959 exactly with tax!  I wish I would've done more research because...

<B>Picture Quality</B>

This is what I hate most about this camera.  The picture quality is not very good at all.  The pictures are mainly fine, but they are VERY grainy.  I usually only use the camera to take web pictures, but nothing serious.  I would be embarrased to use it for professional design, which is why I got it in the first place.

<B>Floppy Disk Storage</B>

Now, there are pros and cons to this.  I like that it is so easy to transfer my pictures using the floppy, but the cons are that it only provides 1.44MB of storage, while a memory card would provide 4-200MB, more MB means more pictures!!!  Also, a lot of computers do not even come with floppy drives anymore.  Look at the whole Apple Computer line, do you see ANY floppy's on those computers?  No.

<B>What Could've You Gotten?</B>

Well, I could've gotten more, but since this was a spur of a moment type thing, I don't really care.  It's just disappointing.  It's not a big deal.
