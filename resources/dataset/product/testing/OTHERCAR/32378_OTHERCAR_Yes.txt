            I purchased a pre owned '99 Navigator (1,700 miles) as a replacement for my aging '93 Suburban.  I really did not like the styling all that much.  I test drove the Lincoln, bought it, and I have never regretted this decision.  

I have driven Range Rovers (nice, but small- cramped driving position), Suburbans (great space, poor quality and reliability), but this Navigator it the greatest of them all. 
 
I did develop an engine knock early on, and the dealer replaced the engine.  I was happy with the service, but disappointed I had to pay the sales tax on the loan car. It was quite a sum, since a new engine had to be shipped in from the factory.  Took about three weeks! 
 
I can say the seat is not so great on my backside for long trips, which I take a lot of (30,000 miles per year+)- suburban was more comfortable with more cushy and support- Lincoln is harder.  Gas mileage is not great, and I hate buying premium, but that is the trade of for more power.  

Would opt for the rear bench instead of the buckets. Nevertheless, I could not think of driving anything else now.  It is truly a great truck. 

Superior power, ride, driving position, and gets lots of attention.  
I will trade it on another one within a year.<br><br>
