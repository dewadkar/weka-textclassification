            We purchased a silver Sebring LXi sedan with all available options four months ago. Overall, we have been incredibly happy with this car so far.

The 200-hp 2.7L V6 has plenty of power and sounds neat to boot. It is fun ripping up V6 Mustangs! The AutoStick transmission is a nice touch for holding gears, and shifts are firmer in the AutoStick mode. 

This car handles well, but you know when you have pushed it to its limits. The suspension yields a beatiful ride, but with slightly firmer tuning and lower profile, wider tires, this car would handle like it's on rails. You just have to keep in mind it is tuned for a more luxurious ride despite the Go-power under the hood.

The interior is roomy and comfortable. I have seen complaints about interior parts but ours seems to have top-notch assembly. The black leather interior looks inviting and doesn't get tiring on long trips. I do however think a car in this league should have automatic climate control (on the LXi) - the Accord EX has it! Also, the moonroof design is silly. It slides on top of the roof instead of inside, and is noisy above 35 mph. It makes for nice in town cruising but forget using it on the highway. Another minor gripe is that the radio reception is not as strong as it could be.

Over long trips the seats start to hurt my back and butt, but then again, I have only sat in one car which HASN'T hurt me on a long trip, and that is the Volvo 760...

Reliability has been flawless. We have had no problems with this car.
