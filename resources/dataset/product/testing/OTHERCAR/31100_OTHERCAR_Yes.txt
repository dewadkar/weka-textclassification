            I Love my Cherokee. It is the first truck I have ever owned and as a tiny woman (5-2)I can finally see everything that is going on around me. I sit up higher than cars, and on an equal level with other trucks now. I no longer must sit behind them all and have problems seeing anything.
My truck was purchased in order to pull a horse trailer so I could bring my two horses to shows. The towing package on this truck does the job. I wouldn't be able to rate it against any others, as I haven't tried any others, I just told the dealer thats what I wanted and I got it. It works perfectly.
This truck is the fastest and most powerful vehicle I have ever owned. It has a v8 and takes off if I just barely step on the gas, this took some getting used to after moving from a 1984 dodge aries station wagon that ran on three out of four cylinders. 
I also appreciate that I do not have to add oil to my truck every week.
I loved my station wagon, But my truck has as much carrying room, way more power and versatility, and can tow my horses around.
The truck does get poor gas mileage, somewhere around 15 I believe. Less when towing something, much less.
This is also an excellent vehicle for where we live, New England, we generally have much snow in the winter, and the full time four wheel drive makes everything easier for me to get around in when we have our storms.
I Love my truck<br><br>
