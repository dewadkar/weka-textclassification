                 I traded my 1994 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo V8 4x4 in for a 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4.0 IL6 4x2 and could not be happier. I drove several other popular SUV's before taking the plunge and I must say that the Jeep Grand Cherokee is the classiest of all others in the market. 

     The Jeep Grand Cherokee hands down is the most comfortable ride when compared to the Toyota 4Runner, Mitsubishi Montero Sport, Hyundai Santa Fe, Toyota Highlander(seems to be more like a mini-van than an SUV), Ford Explorer, Mazda Tribute, Chevrolet Trailblazer, Chevrolet Tahoe, the list goes on. Every vehicle listed above I test drove before returning to the best choice my Jeep Grand Cherokee. 
    
    The "F" package is recommended and I also chose to add leather to my Jeep although I was very impressed with the cloth interior, I think my dogs and soon to be born niece will get along much better with the easy to clean leather interior.
