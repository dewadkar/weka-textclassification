            Let me tell you about my experience with the supra. First of all let me start out by saying OH YEAH BABY! I'll admit, the car intimidated me A LOT when I first saw it. Sometimes (very seldom) I'd see one go down the freeway usually zipping by at around 95mph and sometimes I'd see it in the city with its beautifully bold body and sky scraping rear wing cross through the intersection. The supra was a very different car, but I figured it is just a car right? Oh was I wrong it is so much more! I couldn't get the car out of my mind I had to test drive it! Being as I was finally old enough to test one out, but of course they stopped production of them here in 98' so I was patient in waiting for one to come along used. (which by the way is only once in a blue moon!) Thankfully my blue moon finally arrived and oh was it worth the wait. Once I got behind the wheel of this super sexy powerhouse I was COMPLETELY sold. The sleek interior with all of the options, leather, CD, climate control, almost power everything!! (drool) and the even sleeker sexier exterior. Pounding out 320hp under the hood in a Twin Turbo engine. After the test drive I said to myself, &quot;This car is it!!&quot; Now I am a proud owner of a beautiful White 1995 Toyota Supra Twin Turbo with a sport roof (manually removable roof that fits secure in the trunk) It was the only year they made a Twin Turbo with a sport roof and it KICKS!! 

This car is so much fun to drive with it's screaming 320hp Twin Turbo, there is also a more laid back Single Turbo which still throws 220+ horses at you which is a little less pricey. The car handles like a dream! With a smooth but firm and responsive ride. Quite a bit of room in the front but the rear seats are pointless as hell (excuse me) it would have been so much more fun if it were a 2 seater. the only draw backs to the supra are as follows:
    
1.17mpg
2.You HAVE to use premium gas which is pricey 
3.There is virtually no room in the trunk, but this is hardly the car you take to the market that often!
4.$$$ This car is a price to pay not so much in the actual price since they would be used, (15,000-35,000)but in insurance and gas! $$$

If you have the money to spend, you like different, you like sporty, and you like power! Do yourself a HUGE favor and buy this car!! I did and I have no regrets . it is worth the price.<br><br>
