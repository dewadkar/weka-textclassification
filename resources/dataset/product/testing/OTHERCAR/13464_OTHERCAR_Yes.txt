            Put it in first rev it to the 8,500 RPM red line and drop the clutch.  The Type-R will spin it's tires incredibly.  Put nice sticky rubber on it, slip the clutch and feel it press you back into the seat like no other car twice it's price.  Just remember to keep close to that 8,500 RMP redline, and the horsepower and gearing will do the rest.  The Integra Type-R is an engineering master piece.  Built by Honda, the Type-R has been tuned and perfected right from the factory.  They reduced exhaust and intake restriction, added thicker sway bars, changed the gear ratios, even hand polished the intake valves, to name a few improvements over the GS-R.  By far the most fun car one can buy for less than a $100,000.  It's not for everyone. Actually it's for very few since Honda only imports a couple hundred each year.  Also, the lack of torque is a major set back of the 4 cylinder power plant.  Before the VTEC kicks in the car is almost tame.  Frequent downshifting is necessary to keep the engine in it's prime.  But that's why it's so fun.  When really driven the car is wickedly fast.  Get caught off guard and you have to wait for the RPMs to build.

The Type-R is magical in the hands of a skilled driver.  But straight lines are really only the beginning.  The car is tuned so perfectly it is a dream around corners.  The frame is stiff, the suspension is tuned to race car perfection, and the steering is quick and responsive.  A limited slip differential and the perfect suspension make the front wheel drive car handle perfectly neutrally.    

The car is a dream.  The most fun automobile on the market, with performance to match the likes or Porches and M3s.  Automatic drivers need not apply, it only comes in a 5 speed.  The seats are beautifully crafted buckets that keep you planted through every corner.  Fake carbon fiber,red stitching on seats and shifter, and a brushed aluminum TYPE-R badge round out the purposeful interior.  Everything is well placed and accessible, though it can feel a little &quot;sedanish.&quot;  No optional cruise control or sunroof either.  Stereo is nice, cup holders do tend to block access to it though.  But that's only if you can find something that will actually fit in them(12 oz soda can is about it)  This year, they come in colors too, but the Competition White is part of the escence of this car.  Pure, purposeful, clean.  Don't look for any seat heaters or other pointless amenities, this is a drivers car.  <br><br>
