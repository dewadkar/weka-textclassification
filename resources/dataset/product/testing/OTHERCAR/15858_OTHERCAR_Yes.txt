            Well,  I bought my 1993 Eagle Vision in June of 1999.  For years I had wanted a Dodge Intrepid and since the Vision is essentially the same line of car (just a model up), I took a look.

Specifically, I have the 1993 Eagle Vision TSi and the car came with every factory available option with the sole exception of the child safety seat.  Since I do not yet have a kid or a wife for that matter, this did not pose a problem.

The car handles well.  It should considering it has below average miles on it (66,000).  The ride is very smooth and the suspension always gets compliments from passengers.

The stereo is their factory CD player with the premium speakers and they do sound NICE!

My gripe though is one that MANY Eagle Vision owners have unfortunately had.  The air conditioning on this unit is FREQUENTLY unreliable.  In my case, it's pathetic.  I personally have seen the evaporator core go once this year and the seal went as well.  It's a known problem with this line and Chrysler upgrade the warranty because of it (too bad mine still ran out....7/70)

But the car IS fantastic.  The 3.5l engine easily proves itself when you need that extra umphh on the highway.  The traction control is a welcome option and the seats.......oh yes....the seats.....leather is nice....very nice.....now if they were only heated.....

All in all, this car is what I wanted, what I expected and then some.  Since the line is finished (bye bye eagle) and the new ones (intrepid) have a different chassis, the look will eventually get old.  But I still think it's one of the sharpest looking cars out there on the road.<br><br>
