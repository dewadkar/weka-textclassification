            I'll be the first to agree that the Corolla is not the fastest thing on four wheels but for basic get-you-there-and-back transportation it's the greatest! As a driving instructor I have recommended them to students as a first car. Try as they may the kids couldn't kill our Corolla. They put it up on curbs and once even in a ditch. Also, they run forever on a tank of gas. Another thing I liked about the Corolla was minimal blind spots. Very important, especially since the roadways are now so crowded and side visibility is crucial. I also liked that the drivers's seat lets you sit at a comfortable distance from the wheel and I never felt like I was sitting in a hole.(Very important for the vertically challenged). It's not the quietest ride in the world but it is certainly heads and tails above its' competitors. If you are very tall (or very wide) this is not the car for you. For the average size person I'd say give it a try. <br><br>
