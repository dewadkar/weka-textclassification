            I was looking to buy a newer vehicle than what I currently had (a 76 Chevy Blazer) so I did some research on the internet and decided to try out the Toyota. Friends I spoke to swore by Toyota so I thought I'd go test drive and wheel and deal. I contacted several car dealers and they had my price range and style. I found a sweet truck that was in great shape and after several hours of negotiating I purchased a used 1996 Toyota Tacoma in &quot;98&quot; with 36,000 miles on it. In two years I have put over 40,000 miles on this truck and had it in the shop once for a recall.

I had the truck one year and Toyota did a recall on the head-gaskets. Other than this one major repair, this truck is one of the best purchases I've ever made. The Tacoma 4X4, 5 speed, handles really well in the snow (of course knowing how to drive in snow and icy conditions helps) with some weight in the back. My Chevy was a larger vehicle and was full time four wheel drive and never gave me problems with sliding on the roads so I was leary of this smaller, lighter truck. I was not disappointed.

Open highway travel is wonderful. It is a very comfortable truck with a split bench seat, an arm rest, head rests on both seats and extra room in the back for a small person or extra luggage, etc...
It gets good gas mileage, it looks good, and all in all I highly recommend this truck to anyone who likes to drive trucks.<br><br>
