I own a 1996 two-door Chevy Cavalier onto which I have loaded 80,000 miles. It has driven from Texas to Michigan at least 5 times, hauled small U-Haul trailers behind it, and sat idle in a garage for over 8 months. It has absorbed the Texas heat and handled the northern ice. And with all the love and abuse it has taken, my Cavalier has never needed a �real� part repaired. I say �real� because I did have to introduce my Cav to a mechanic for the first time last week to have new brake pads installed and I have had to have the trunk lock repaired, but I don�t really consider these �real parts.�

Also on the positive side, Cavaliers are troopers and all-around vehicles. They are heavy enough to drive on ice and light enough so they don�t break your wallet every time you fill up on gas. (Currently it takes me $19 to fill a tank as gas is at $1.48 a gallon.) 

There are two drawbacks to the Cavalier, however, although they may have been rectified on later models: one, the ceiling is too low and two, the aforementioned trunk lock is fragile. As for the ceiling height, I once had a 6�4 Australian riding in the passenger�s seat, and we had to open the sunroof so the top of this head could fit inside the car. I am 5�8 and fit comfortably into the car, but anyone over this height will have difficulty-and probably a sore neck! As for the trunk lock, I have stopped using it all together. To put stuff in my trunk, I have resorted to accessing it through the fold-down back seat (another handy feature). If I tried to open the trunk through the lock, the trunk would either not shut again, or simply not open. I have had the trunk lock fixed three times and have basically given up on it.

All in all, the Cavalier is a good deal for your money. I bought my 96 model for $15,000 although it did have 9,000 miles on it to start. It comes with a three-year warranty or a 36,000 mile warranty on parts, whichever comes first, which is pretty standard. It has good pick-up and strength, excellent part endurance and, again, is good in all sorts of weather.  I feel confident in renting this vehicle to anyone under 6�0!
