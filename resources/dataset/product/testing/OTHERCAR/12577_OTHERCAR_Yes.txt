            If you want speed without the racecar, snag an Acura Integra with a V-TEC engine.  I personally have a 1996 GSR Accura Integra with a stickshift.  The stick allows you to take full control of the V-TEC engine, so I would recommend the stick if you are buying the car for the V-TEC.  The handling is decent, but not nearly as performing as its Honda Prelude counterpart. 

The legroom in the backseat is not good if you will be driving around a pair of 6 foot basketball players.  It's a little difficult to get in and out of the backseat, and the headroom is also a little low (but, it is a coupe).  

One interesting note:  the speaker system is very good.  I was adding an amplifier to the stereo, and was deciding whether or not to replace the speakers with a set of better quality.  The technician told me that the fairly expensive speakers I was going to use were lower quality than the factor Acura speakers.
