            I bought this Kodak camera a few weeks ago because my 35mm camera got broken.  I had always had 35mm camera's so I was a little wary about going to a digital camera.  However, when I looked at what I did with pictures, the digital camera made much more sense over traditional film.  I seemed to spend more time scanning physical photographs into my computer (for web-pages and what not) than I did actually looking at them. 

The biggest motivator for buying the camera when I did was that I was headed back to Alaska to visit my parents with my girlfriend and you kind of need a camera for that type of trip.  So far, the Kodak DC215 has not disappointed.  

The camera has 2 settings for quality, one I understand, and one I don't.  One setting is called quality.  It has the options for good, better, and best.  If I had to guess, I would say this is 16 bit, 24 bit, and 32 bit pictures.  I did the math on the file sizes and it seem to support this guess.  The other, more understandable selection is called resolution.  The camera can take either 640x480 or 1152x864.  

I take all my pictures in the best resolution and quality and a love them.  I bought a 32 MB flash card ($99) for the camera and have no problem with space.  I can take an amazing 113 pictures to the tiny little card in the best resolution.  It's great.  However, the 4 MB card they give with the camera is really next to useless, I think you can fit 13 pictures on it in the best quality mode.

The camera also has a 2x optical zoom.  When shopping for a camera is important to distinguish between digital and optical zoom.  Optical zoom is the zoom we are familiar with on traditional cameras.  That is to say, the lens actually moves to zoom in or out.  Digital zoom is actually what you would do in, say, Adobe PhotoShop.  The camera basically has the same pixels it would without the &quot;zoom&quot; but enlarges the pixels.  The 2x zoom on this camera is...useful, at best, but not much more.  I might prefer more zoom, but what is here is adequate.  

The camera isn't very &quot;programmable&quot; compared to my old Samsung 35mm.  However, it does have a self-portrait mode where you can set the timer and get in the shot yourself.  I consider this to be indispensable.  It also has a portrait mode for taking close-ups of people.  Yet, to the best of my knowledge, all this does is zoom in.  Yippee.  Elsewise, you can set the flash for auto, none, always, red-eye reduction, and auto red-eye reduction.

Of course, the best part of the camera is the color LCD screen on the back.  When you take a picture there is an option to have the picture pop up on the back for you to inspect.  This is great because it enables you to see if something is in the shot you didn't want.  Also, you can turn on a mode where the screen displays what the camera &quot;sees&quot; so you needn't use the view finder.

This brings up the camera's WORST point however...batteries.  This camera goes through batteries faster than NASCAR cars go through tires.  I make attempts to conserve batteries, not use the review mode, not use the active LCD screen much, not turn the camera on and off (it opens and closes the lens) and I will be lucky to shoot 50 pictures on one set of batteries.  I don't use alkaline batteries however, I actually use Rayovac Renewal batteries.  They are alkaline, but rechargeable.  Since they are alkaline they last a good long time, but can be recharged.  I would never use rechargables because they die WAY to fast in digital pieces.  And, at $3 per 4 AA batteries (the amount the camera takes) I would go broke using straight Alkalines.  

In summation, this camera is great and I have no regrets.  The picture quality is excellent, it isn't bulky, and you can take hundreds of pictures.  In the case of this camera however, the limit isn't &quot;film&quot; but batteries.  Yet, if you use Renewal batteries, (or better yet, the Rayovac Ultra Nickel batteries) it  should be no problem.  I would buy this camera again.<br><br>
