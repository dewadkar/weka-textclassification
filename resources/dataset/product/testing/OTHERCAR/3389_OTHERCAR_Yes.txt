            I've had my XK8 for almost 1 year now and I'm still in love with it.

About 3 yrs ago a friend of ours had purchased this car and the minute
I saw it I told my husband I wanted one.....he of course told me I
was crazy....and you know what...he's right.  

Last year I decided to treat myself to this sexy car and haven't had
a second thought since.

It rides beautifully for a sports car, very smooth and easy to handle.
The lines of this car are so absolutely sexy that even I look better in
it....

The wood grain interior is very classy looking and of course I got all the
bells and whistles with it too.....

The built in phone system, power everything, front &amp; rear radar detector
and of course the wind screen to keep my &quot;do&quot; from getting messed up while
I'm driving with the top down.

The service on this car has been minimal and the service department has
been very professional and accomodating.

It's expensive....don't get me wrong....between my payments, insurance
and registration it's just about the same as my mortgage payment...but
hey...you only live once...go for it<br><br>
