            I bought this camera on 6th of Jan, I never tried to use the flash until the 13th. It was not working. ONE MONTH LATER and I still do not have the camera! DO NOT SEND IN YOUR WARRANTY CARD UNTIL YOU KNOW EVERYTHING WORKS! The store you bought it from may not take it back! Sony has the worst Customer Service of any large company I have ever seen! 

They told me to drive my camera to Sacramento, Ca 130 miles away. Thats 520 miles for 4 one way trips! They told me that before go make sure to call to Sacramento to see if anyone is qualified to repair the camera!

If I knew the Customer Service was so Bad on this I would have NEVER bought this camera, no matter how good someone says it is!!

I sent them two complaint letters and sent them over night express hoping this would get me some help. That was 10 days ago and no response! I had to send two of the same letters to Sony as No-one was sure of the address to the Customer Service Departments Head office!! I have spent over $100.00 just on shipping the camera or paperwork concerning the camera!
