               <b>T</b>oyota's Celica has come a very long way since the first version which used to also carry the name 'Supra' as the up-scale trim line. The early versions could be considered, to many, as a  downscaled homage to the fastback Ford Mustang, however for for the 1998 model year the Celica has its own sporty identity with good performance to match. 

<i>Driving Impressions:</i>
  
<b>The 1998 Celica</b> has just what a sports car needs. Dramatic styling, and relatively good power delivery from its 2.2 liter twin cam 4-cylinder engine. It is also easy to exploit all the performance, with an all-independent <b>suspension,</b> sharp steering with a hint of understeer, and great handling, the Celica is an  enjoyably easy car to drive. The Celica is very comfortable while <b>cruising</b> at high speeds and tackles sharp corners with ease; remaining flat and neutral, yet it retains a comfortable ride. 
<b>Braking</b> is excellent, no fade, or shudder whatsoever, even with 30,000 miles on my tester. The 4-wheel disc brakes coupled with ABS makes for a very solid attribute from this car. 

  <b>Revs</b> are necessary with this Toyota made 16-valve, iron block, twin cam four cylinder, which was carried over from the previous Celica. The power output has risen considerably over the years, and at 130 horsepower this is relatively impressive for a 2.2 liter 4-cylinder produced between 1994-1998. Torque is fair, the Celica has 145 lb-ft @4,400 RPM. Its rev happy nature is due to its tuned dual phase intake system, in which different length inlet operates when the engine approaches 5,000 RPM.

 <b>Toyota</b> had already proven that it could produce an excellent handling car with strut suspension all around, and this layout is retained on the current Celica. The combination of the short rear overhang, and the weight of the engine mounted at the front results in a nose heavy car, but this does not affect handling whatsoever.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i> 

   The <b>interior</b> of the 1998 Celica is a little drab, however functional is probably the best way to describe the Celica's cabin. Lateral support offered from the cloth bucket seats and the driving position are superb combined with great outward vision. 
The Celica comes with supportive bucket seats, that are comfortable enough for long road trips, and offer adequate bolstering for aggressive driving. I personally did not think they were as comfortable as the Prelude's leather seating, but maybe they needed some additional time to get used to. The stock stereo system is fair, this system is no knock out system but does provide decent sounding tunes. The steering wheel is thick, and there is enough room for 2 adults up front, and two kids or small adults in the back.


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>       

 The <b>exterior</b> is a combination of very striking lines and curves. This is a very desirable coupe, and if you ask me, Hyundai used a little of this styling with their 1st generation Tiburon. The 1998 Celica GT comes with 15" five spoke alloys rims, spoiler, round headlamps, square tail lamps, and a very aggressive stance for a small 2 door coupe. The Celica GT comes in either a coupe or a convertible. The convertible is much more expensive and is quite rare.
    
 The <b>price</b> for a 1998 Celica GT Coupe is around $12,000. This is an excellent deal, and although you won't have the fastest car on the market, you will have one of the most reliable. The Cleica's 2.2 is as solid as a rock, as most owners will tell you. I do not own one of these cars so I can not comment personally, but this car has got rave reviews.

<i>Conclusion:</i>

While not the fastest car on the market, nor a car offering the most bang for your buck, the Celica is a competent sports coupe that is fun to drive. If you are looking for a reliable and handsome little sports coupe on the used market the 1998 Toyota Celica is worth a test drive.
