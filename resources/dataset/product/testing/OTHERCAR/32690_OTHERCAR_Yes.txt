            The lens, the anti-shake system, the plethora of adjustments the camera lets you make, the clear and simple controls, the superb picture quality - all this does not exist in another camera in this class and at this price right now.
So everything is fine? Well, not exactly. Forget about using the viewfinder in low light situations - it produces grainy, washed-out images. The cool thing though, is that on auto the camera recognizes when you are using the display monitor on the back and turns off the viewfinder. Then again, when you put your eye on the viewfinder, it turns off the display monitor automatically. 
Also are very cool thing is that you can shift the focus point all around the viewing area - this is a killer feature when it comes to people portraits! Also very cool is the non-motorized zoom, which you have to operate by hand. This is actually much more precise and quicker than the usual motor variant.
The camera will record images in a Minolta proprietary RAW format. You need to install the provided software to access the files. If you save such a RAW file in TIFF afterwards, it becomes a whopping 30 MB! 
The provided software is a bit on the simple side and I only use it to access the RAW files and convert them into a more common format. The controls are very basic and here Minolta should invest a little more in the future.
Bottom line: a great camera with some very minor annoyances which should by no means hold anybody back to buy this thing!
