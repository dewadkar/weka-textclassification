            It's rather hard to be unhappy about an excellent car like 2001 Audi S4. But in the near-luxury sports car market standards are set way too high by the likes of BMW and Mercedes-Benz.

I was thinking about ending my lease for a 2000 BMW 323 (its price held up very nicely so that wouldn't cost me any money) and was looking forward to getting a new BMW 330. The only problem was that I had to wait for a couple of months to get the car. So I decided to look around for an alternative. Audi S4 was a very logical choice, or so I thought. 

I came to the dealership one Saturday morning and started by looking at Audi A4 2.8. I checked the driver's seat and found out that I almost touch the roof, but it wasn't too bad. Most of the people would be very comfortable there. The back seat is a little bit cramped, pretty much like in BMW 3 Series, but I think the rear door is a little smaller, than in 3. After that I found a dealer and decided to take an S4 for a spin. Technical characteristics looked great - 250 HP turbocharged 2.7 liter engine, all-wheel drive. 

So I decided to start with the sound system test (I brought a CD with me). I don't know if the system was faulty or if it was supposed to be like that, but I hated it. The bass was woofing like crazy, no mid-range at all. I turned the bass down to the lowest level, but it still sucked. The dealer told me that it was supposed to be like that, but I think he was wrong :) 

I liked the steering. It was very direct and precise, very much like in BMW 330. It was also quite easy to turn the wheel at low speed, but it would become very firm at higher speed. I was surprised with somewhat loud engine noise, but it wasn't too bad. I loved the brakes, very firm and predictable. 

Now the bad: Like any turbo-charged car Audi S4 has turbo lag. For about a second there's very little pull when you floor it. It's even more annoying when you combine turbo with automatic transmission. But after a second or so the turbo kicks in and it pulls real hard! 

But what I really didn't like was the number of tiny little levers, buttons, etc. that are supposed to control the computer, radio and air conditioning. All those little buttons aren't marked very well and took me awhile to learn how to adjust the temperature. 

The seats are very strange. They're _very_ comfortable on the bottom, but the back feels like there's a plastic panel under the leather. Very strange feeling, but I suppose it makes you more alert while driving :) 

Now, Audi S4 is a very good car. But for this kind of money you can get a BMW 330 or Mercedes C320 and S4 just doesn't stand up to such competition.
