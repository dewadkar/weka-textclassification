            I received this digital masterpiece for Christmas, and have had it out of the box and in my pocket ever since!  This is camera and is loaded with features.  

The three different picture formats each have different quality settings, and with the ability to upgrade the memory stick your picture taking is endless.  Directly connecting the camera to the computer gives you the opportunity to email the pictures to your family, resize them, make holiday cards, build a website, or send it to a printer and develop away.

I especially like the style and look of this camera.  It is extremely lightweight and very sleek looking.  It doesn't seem flimsy at all, and I am never worried about any pieces breaking off. 

As far as features this has way too many to list.  But lets put it this way: Any picture you want to take, at any time, and any place, this camera has the functions to make that picture perfect.  This is great to capture memories, and with the LCD screen you can see if the picture you just took, might need to be shot real quick, before the moment is gone.  

The only gripes I have are the battery life.  After a few days of picture taking and resting, the batteries are reading to sit on the charger it comes with for 4 hours.  There are faster chargers for more money, and also an adapter.  Also, the flash when utilized takes awhile between pictures to refresh.  

I definitely recommend this camera, from a reputable company, well known in photography.  If you plan on getting a digital camera, make it this one.
