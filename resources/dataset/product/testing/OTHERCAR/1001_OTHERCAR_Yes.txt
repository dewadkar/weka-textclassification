            I recently sold my 17 year old Toyota Corolla and it was in mint condition.  I still did not have any squeaks or rattles anywhere inside or outside on that vehicle.

Needless to say I bought another Toyota product.  The XR Matrix in June 2003 (2004 model).

I hope this vehicle is mechanically sound as my previous Toyota.  I trust it will be given Toyota's reputation.

However, the fit and finish has deteriorated possibly since it is assembled in North America.  Who knows?

I agree with other reviews when they state the engine noise is a little loud.  On normal acceleration it is quite acceptable but only during moderate to hard acceleration does it become a problem.

Yes, the car could use more horsepower and more importantly more torque.  Since I'm a family man now, the horsepower and torque is sufficient for my needs. 

Now about that fit and finish problem.
Watch for:
-the driver's side of the dash being lower than the passenger side.  It doesn't line up with the "A" pillar in the corner near the front windshield (noticed this on most Matrixs),
-squeaks in the dash especially in the trim below and to the right of the radio (foam tape underneath repaired problem for now),
-discoloration and abrasions in plastic on dash and interior door panel (I don't believe this is a systemic problem-replaced with no problems), 
-storage bin door that flips down to open on the lower center console below the heating controls near the floor may fall off repeatedly (my car was fine),
-storage covers in the corners of the inside of the trunk do not clip closed at the tops (several other covers ordered still did not close at the top but the bottom and center clips hold it together - a few other Matrixs at the dealer didn't have this problem),
-driver's window rubber weatherstrip didn't fit properly at the bend/corner where the "A" pillar is near the exterior mirror (seen on many Matrixs-replaced weatherstrip and fine now),
-driver's side rear no draft window is not flush near the bottom where it meets the rear hatch glass that curves around the side of the car (seen on many Matrixs - not repaired feeling the factory seal is better),
-space between the rear bumper and the rear quarter panels behind the rear tires are not equal on both side of car (my car is fine),
-one clear protective 'dog leg' vinyl on exterior near the bottom of car to protect from stone chips had excessive air bubbles and was not affixed tightly (probably not a systemic problem - replaced by dealer).

P.S. purchase the optional trunk mat otherwise everything will slide on the hard plastic surface while driving.
