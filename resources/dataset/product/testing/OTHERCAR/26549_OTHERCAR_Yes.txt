            1996 Chevy S-10 Extended Cab
     I recently purchased a 1996 Chevy S-10. Let me just say in my own opinion they are not what I had expected .Don't get me run the truck runs great .It has it's good points and bad as well. For starter it's great on gas and does not use,burn, or leak oil. It's also pretty roomy for a truck and has quite a bit of power for a 4 cylinder.I change the oil frequently so have not had to take it to a garage .I can assume the parts are expensive though.Also it has a third door which helps to put things in the rear of the cab.
         On the flip side of things. The truck is very costly. As for winter driving it has no traction and is very light. This make's it very hard to control on slippery surface's, even in the rain.The jump seat in the rear I feel is not the safest for children. Also I would like to say the Anti- Lock brake system is trouble.You never know when it's going to come on and doesn't allow for quick stops.
            I owning one of these trucks would definitely not recommend one to a friend or anyone.
