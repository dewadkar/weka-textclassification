                 Never been dissappointed with Volvo. Though friends
have laughed at the boxy appearance Volvo has had,
the latest trends in volvo design have been to develop
a sleeker, more sporty feel.

Design

Currently Volvo is trying to appeal to the younger set,
and this car does convey a more youthful, energetic 
appearance.  The S60 is designed with sloping lines and
a truncated back, much like the shape of a classics
sports car.  The cockpit is driver-oriented with easy to 
reach controls and instruments. The rear seats can
accomodate three adults very comfortably. The S60 has
dual climate controls and a pollen filter system which
does wonders for my allergies.  Adjustable rear air vents
provide more air control for passengers. A more
sophisticated active carbon filter for serious 
allergy sufferers is an optional feature. 
The interior is a sea of comfort.  Convenience
abounds---there's a premium sound system, a personal
security system, and devices to adjust your mirrors
and seating. If you need extra storage, you've got the
60/40 rear folding back seat capacity. 

Performance, Safety

Exceptional. The S60s three engine choices include
a 2.4 liter tied to a five speed manual or automatic,
a 2.4T with a low-pressure turbo tied to a five-speed
automatic, and the T5 with a 2.3 liter, high-pressure
turbo engine tied to a five-speed manual or optional
automatic with manual shifting features.  There's 
a performance range to fulfill a wide variety of
driving desires.  The S60 encompasses a good deal
of active and passive safety features.  Active safety
features include 4-channel, antilock brakes, dual stage
air bags, side-impact air-bags, and inflatable 
head curtain for both front and rear passengers.
It's also got 4 wheel independents suspension. 

Environmental Concerns

The car meets ultra-low emissions standards and 
the cars are designed to meet plans for future
recycling. 


In short

This is a forward thinking, intelligent car and
Volvo has done an exceptional job. You would not
be unlucky to have this car and have the assuredness
of having the safest car in the world
