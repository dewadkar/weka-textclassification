            I bought my Grand Caravan SE 2 1/2 years ago with 44K miles on it. I purchased it based on reliability reports from Consumer Reports and it was in out budget.  Overall it has been a good van.  I would not say great! But good.  Luckily I did buy an extended warranty when I purchased the van. During this warranty period the Cooling Fan Relay failed, the Wiper Switch had to be replaced (wipers would just come on), and the tensioning pulley was causing belts to slide off.  The screws in the plastic cover on the tail gate had to be tightened every 500 miles, until finnaly I replaced them with much much larger ones.  A screw holding the plastic cover below the radio on, falls out regularly.  We have had one annoying problem that the dealer has not been able to fix.  Everytime you pull in or out of a driveway there is a creaking sound from the front suspension. At this point we are just living with it waiting for whatever is causing the noise to fail so we can have it replaced.  This is average according to Consumer Reports.  I would hate to see below or much below average!

Since purchasing the van I have put 120K miles on the van.  I enjoy driving it. The kids have lots of room. Mileage is OK. About 22 1/2 mpg with any kind of driving and the 3.0L engine. I have been told by several mechanics not to abuse the transmission on the 3.0L / 3 spd model. 

If you plan on taking the seats in and out routinely.  Start lifting weights!  I am young and strong and they are still a handful! The rollers help compared to older Caravans but you still have to lift them up and out.

This was my first purchase of an American auto company's vehicle in several years and with the many annoying little problems and noises will probably be the last.  If you are considering purchasing one. Have a mechanic check out the transmission completely and engine for motor oil leaks. Electrical problems have plagued Caravans in the past. So far I have been lucky but look for them too.<br><br>
