            While checking out the BMW station wagon I went to the next door Volvo dealership to have a quick look at the new 2001 Volvo Cross Country .... and was surprised my its aggressive and yet sporty looks, if one can refer to a wagon as sporty. The interior was extremely well done, interesting "baseball" glove stitching on the leather seats, similar to the Audi TT, but not as overdone as the Audi's.

I took the Volvo for a very extensive test drive, along highways and it traveled flawlessly, a touch of wind noise perhaps, but very minor, and only noticeable without the radio on. Then along snow covered gravel country roads, and it was an absolute charm to drive. I had total confidence in the AWD system. 

Seat comfort and visibility from the drivers seat are very important to me. I am 6'3" tall, and often find that seat cushions are not long enough in many vehicles to provide proper support, which was not the case here. The seats were very comfortable, nice side bolstering, good lumbar support, spacious seat cushion. I also found that the windshield went up high enough so that I did not have to squat down, as I have to in some cars, to avoid looking at the sun visors.

In the city it was easy to maneuver, good sight lines and mirrors. The extra few inches of height were not really noticeable, but then I normally drive a Jeep which is higher. For folks that are used to driving cars with the standard ride height this would be a nice improvement, without being as elevated as a SUV.

The interior seemed spacious, certainly smaller then a SUV or Van, but it is a station wagon and obviously cannot have the same load capacity.

Other folks here can provide the tech specs, I prefer to just comment on what appeals to me when I look for a vehicle to purchase, and I suspect most folks buy that way. 

I would certainly recommend test driving this Volvo if someone is interested in either moving down from the mass size and truck like ride of a large SUV, or prefers a smoother ride and handling then the mid-size SUV's  provide .... or wants to move up from a car to something with a bit more safety, space and wonderful styling.

The wife, who drives sports cars, and turned up her nose at the suggestion of looking at a station wagon, was very surprised at the superb outside styling, still not her kind of vehicle, but she certainly would have no problems with having one in the garage. She was impressed, and it certainly is not an old university professors car anymore.

Thank you for reading this.
