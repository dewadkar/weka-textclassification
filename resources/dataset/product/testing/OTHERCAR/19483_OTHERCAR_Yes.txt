            I recently purchased a new 2002 BMW 745il.  I spent a considerable amount of time researching this car versus the Mercedes S500 series and it was a close call.  If you look at the two cars line by line, the BMW wins on most counts.  The BMW has a bit more horsepower (325 vs. 302), less torque (330 vs 339), a shade faster acceleration (0-60 in 5.9 seconds vs. the Mercedes at 6.1), a smaller engine (4.4 vs. 4.9) and better MPG (18/26 vs. 16/23).

As far as comfort is concerned, I found the BMW's optional Luxury seating ($1,600 MSRP) to be more comfortable than the Mercedes, although Mercedes does offer upgraded seating that was not available when I purchased.  The Luxury seating package on the BMW offers ventilated and heated seats, with the added advantage of active massage for the long trips.  

Driving both cars was a pleasure.  I liked the Mercedes Steptronic transmission (standard) over the BMW, especially in rapid stops.  BMW does offer Steptronic on it's other models and will offer it on the 7 next year.  Evidently, the steptronic causes the vehicle to be subject to the "gas guzzler" tax, and they are working on fixing that.  

Both cars handle almost like sport cars, surprising for their size.  Both have a type of leveling technology for the hard turns and accelerate extremely well.  You won't find a better riding car in this class.

Now, let's discuss the much-covered I-Drive.  When I first started driving the car I must admit to being a bit confused by all the technology.  Mercedes seems to do a better job with the technology, although they offer far fewer features.  The I-Drive pretty much lets you do anything you could ever think of, and plenty more.  You control your telephone, phone book, inside climate, audio, GPS navigation, service schedules, and roadside assistance all from a little mouse-like device that interacts with the information screen.  The good news is that you can use it as little or as much as you need, and get used to it over time.  

The basic "driving" functions can all still be performed without the I-Drive.  Radio volume, station changes, song changes, telephone, and climate controls can all be accessed either on the steering wheel or the dash.  As I am learning the system, I am using the I-Drive more and more, especially when parked.  A nice feature is voice-recognition which can be used to change stations, songs, or call someone in your phone book.

I chose the 745li over the 745i.  The only real difference between the two is the length, most of which is in the back seat.  I am 6' tall and could fit with room to spare in the back with the front seat far back.  The difference in price is about $100 per month on a 36 month lease.

I would suggest using some of the internet sites for pricing the car before you decide to purchase.  I did and was able to substantially reduce my monthly payment from the original quote of $1200 to about $1000 on a 36 month lease with nothing down.  

Ask your salesperson about multiple security deposits as well.  BMW offers a programs whereby you put more than one security deposit down (up to 10 months worth) and the monthly lease payment is reduced accordingly.  In my case, the original lease payment was $1193.  I gave them a check for roughly $10,000 and they reduced the payment to $1004.  At the end of the lease, you get the security deposits back.  It works out to a roughly 12% return on your money, not bad in this market.

All in all, I made my decision based on price, features, and styling.  BMW won on price and features, and I'm still not sure which one wins on styling.  I imagine I will grow to love this new body style as much as I loved the old one, however I do wish they didn't change the back.
