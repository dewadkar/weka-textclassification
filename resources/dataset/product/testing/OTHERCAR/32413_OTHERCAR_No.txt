            Exactly one month ago, my Civic was broken into.  My Stereo was completely broken, and all of my CD's were stolen.  Thankfully, I have the electronic key in my CX.  I love the car, it's great to drive, and very compact-which also makes parking easy.  <br>I do however have one problem with this make.  There is no place to lock up valuables.  The trunk locks but you are able to pop the trunk from inside the car, and the glove compartment doesn't lock at all.  <br><br>Although I love this car, I have a problem with it since it was so easily broken into.  There is no way to protect anything, and I am now scared to leave the car in any unattended parking lot at night.  I've done research on the subject, and have found that Civics are the #1 most broken-into automobiles in the past couple of years.  I am now thinking of trading in the Civic for a less conspicuous car, even though I have been thoroughly satisfied with the car otherwise.  <br><br><br>
