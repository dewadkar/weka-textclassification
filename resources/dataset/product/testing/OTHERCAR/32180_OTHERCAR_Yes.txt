            I have owned a 1999 Cavalier for just over a year now. I wanted a two-door manual transmission that wasn't going to cost me an arm and a leg. But I have three kids, so one of my requirements was that there be 3 seatbelts in the back seat. 

I love the handling of my car, it can be powerful for highway driving, or take the slowness of rush hour just the same. Unlike some cars, mine has very comfortable seating for all riders. I've ridden in the backseat and still been comfortable. I may not be able to stretch out like I would in a mini-van, but I'm not too crunched either.

For long-distance travel, it has been great. Good gas mileage, smooth ride, and a good stereo system.

The only thing I would really change about the whole car would be to give it a slightly smoother shifting. The stick shift is not as smooth as the one in my husbands car (a '98 Acura Integra), you can actually feel it moving from one gear to the next. But I am not saying it is difficult to shift, it's not.

I've already been requested by my 14 year old that I hang on to it so she can have it when she turns 16. Well, she might get to drive it, but I think I'm going to keep it longer than that.<br><br>
