            I wanted a new compact car that was reasonably priced, yet fun to drive.  I've heard great things over the years about the high quality of Toyota cars, but had never driven one.  Decided this one looked interesting enough to take the plunge.....

I was impressed with the roominess of the interior.  I have long legs and a lot of compact cars come up short in that department.  I loved the look and the fact that the driver's seat was high and offered a better view of the road!  So far, so good!

Then, I took the road test....

The layout of the dashboard was distracting, to say the least.  I suppose one could get used to it, but it would take some time.  That didn't bother me as much as the fact that it seemed you could hear everything outside the car!  The wind.  The road.  Other cars.

As I was driving along, I noticed an odd sound coming from the back every time I hit even the smallest bump in the road.  Since the sales person was along for the ride, I figured it was time to quiz him.  At first he pretended not to know what I was talking about.  Finally, he said that he heard it too.  I asked if there was something in the trunk that could be making the racket.  He replied that yes, there was a box of items in the trunk, and they must be moving around.  Strange, don't you think?  When I returned to the dealership, I asked the sales person to open the trunk so I could see what was in the trunk.  He hemmed and hawed, but finally did.  The ONLY items in the trunk were the floor mats for the front seat!  So basically, it was just the car......

I was also concerned about the fact that I live in an area that has snow and ice every winter.  I questioned the sales person regarding traction, since it is a compact.  He replied that there were no problems with traction and that it ran great in snow and ice.  Later I found out that the car did not even come on the market until spring!

Overall, I was very disappointed with the car.  <br><br>
