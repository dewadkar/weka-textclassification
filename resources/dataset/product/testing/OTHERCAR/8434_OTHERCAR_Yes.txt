            In 1998, Lexus had perceived an image problem.  All its cars had a reputation of being nice, and uninspiring to drive.  It was fast replacing M-B as the car for well to do fiftysomething folks.  Having accomplished its initial goal, Lexus set its sights on BMW.  The original GS was offered as a 3liter model only, but it was deemed too heavy and underpowered to be a serious contender.  So Lexus went back to the drawing board, and this time, took more direct aim.

I drove a 1999 GS300, a 2000 GS300, and a 1998 GS400.  The 300's are good cars, but this opinion will concentrate on the 8-cylinder. 

Styling -
Generally, I like the looks of this car.  The bug-eyed headlamps and tail lamps are unique in any class( some call it odd.) and sets it apart in this luxury class.
The GS squats in a purposeful stance, its angled nose and blunt tail accentuating its nature.  The car looks best in black, then white.  Metallic colors don't work too well.  
The interior design is more conventional, with rich, soft leather and neatly arranged dash.  The white on black instrument cluster is easy on the eyes and immediately legible.  Power telescopic steering wheel and seats will allow you to find a comfortable driving position.  A car with this much power could use more lateral support for the driver, but all in all, not a bad seat.  The back seats are roomy and comfortable, but not where you want to be in this car.  

Driving-
If you want to buy the 300, never ask to drive the GS400.
Using the same 4.0 liter V8 as the LS, the GS motor is massaged to a 300hp output.  This 80 hp advantage over the 3 liter is quickly evident, as the car eagerly thrusts forward.  The acceleration is amazing, considering that Lexus transmission makes you launch the car in second gear.  The E-shift steering wheel controlled manu-matic is not intuitive, and I did not have enough time in the test drive to come to grips with it.   

The GS400 is more at home on the highway, stretching its long legs.  The occupants are shielded away from road and wind noise, and bumps are absorbed well.  The car is not nimble, but it has good manners.  You can say it is agile for a car of this size.  Lane changes are handled with ease.  I felt the suspension was a little too soft for this car, as dive under breaking and squat under acceleration were apparent.  Even with 17 inch low profile tires, the steering feels a little disconnected from the road.  

My biggest gripe is with the brakes. they do not measure up to the rest of the car. Its not so much stopping power as it is the lack of pedal feel.   Maybe the ABS needs a little work.  They felt best on the 300, and not surprisingly, worst on the 400 with 50,000 miles on the odo.  

Summary-
A new 300 is worthy of consideration, especially if negotiated to the $40k range.  that is, unless you have experienced the 400, with its addictive zoom.  If you can live with a used car, a three year old 400 may not be such a bad deal.
