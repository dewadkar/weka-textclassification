            I recently leased a Ford Escape, wanting a smaller and more fuel-efficient vehicle than an Explorer or other monster-SUV. Since the demise of the hatchback, it's been very difficult for a 30-something like me to find something sporty to drive and practical space-wise to carry the wife, friends, the loyal dog, and the occasional large piece of furniture.  Last weekend, I rented a Chrysler PT Cruiser as a possible candidate for my next car. Realizing that it was based on the Neon, I didn't expect great things from the car but I was very impressed at the get-go.

<b>Exterior/Interior</b>
A stylish exterior that echoes the Plymouth Prowler's hot-rod paddy wagon look wraps around the most practical interior I've ever seen - the rear hatch opens to a large trunk with a multi-configurable shelf that can even sub as a tailgate picnic table. Seats can fold and split - even the front passenger seat can fold flat to accommodate pass-through luggage.  The seats were great - you sit up very high - almost SUV like in either front or back seats. It would have been nice to have had more side bolstering for the drivers seat and the arm rest is too narrow to be comfortable. Add to that, a very stylish retro dash board with nice design cues and you have a great looking car that doesn't embarrass you with a station wagon feel.

In the streets of San Francisco and on the couple of gas station stops, the PT Cruiser got lots of stares and smiles.

<b>Engine/Economy</b>
On our drive from LA to San Francisco, again I was surprised to be impressed. The engine - obviously at its best as an urban driver - was fine and quiet on the highway. I locked it in at 80 on cruise control and had no problems. On the 101 and in San Francisco, I shifted to 3 which stopped the "hunt and peck" shifting of the transmission and it was fine. On occasion, I did think it was under-powered when passing, but overall, I thought the 4 cylinder engine was up to the task. The best part was that it only took 3 tanks of gas to drive back and forth the 800 mile journey.

<b>Overall</b>
I did find some of the interior to be of cheap plastic - particularly the overhead compass console which jiggled from the ceiling. The steering wheel seemed a little oversized as well. But overall, from a design point of view, there's very little wrong with the PT Cruiser - and for most people who *think* they need an SUV and are too cool for, say a Focus station wagon, this is your car... and this will be my next car!

Unfortunately, with the surprise success of the PT Cruiser, demand currently outstrips supply so local dealers in the LA area are charging $2K-$5K over sticker price. Otherwise, be prepared to wait at least 6 months if you place an order. 

I'm willing to wait to see if the 2002 or 2003 model year brings a more potent engine as well as improved front collision safety (The PT Cruiser fared poorly in the NHTSA front-end collision tests).
