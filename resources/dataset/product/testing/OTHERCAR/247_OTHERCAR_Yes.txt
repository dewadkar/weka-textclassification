            This is my first digital camera; I've had the G1 for a few months now, and it's given me some excellent pictures. My favorite thing about the camera is the battery. I took the G1 camping one weekend and took about 200 pictures; I also played them back several times on the same charge.

The G1 has several great features. The MPEG mode is handy for sending quick clips of my son to my Dad. The quality of these clips are so-so, but the immediacy is a good trade-off. The ability to zoom and pan around the picture on the camera is critical for deciding which shots to keep - you can quickly tell whether the subject is in-focus. I have a 128M card, which is more than enough if I delete the mistakes as I go. The hotshoe is nice, though I haven't bought an external flash yet. Baseband video out is great - we went to Disney, and then enjoyed the photos on our hotel TV that night.  

I only have a few nitpicks. The manual focus takes some getting used to; a focus ring would be better. The autofocus often selects the background over the subject, but I think this is due to my amateur status. Finally, you'll notice a definite purplish tint in some areas if you compose a scene with bright sunlight backlighting it. You can avoid this problem through careful composition - put the sun behind you, if possible.

Digital camera are to film cameras what word processors once were to typewriters. It's wonderful to have the power to shoot something 4-5 times, and save only the best shot.
