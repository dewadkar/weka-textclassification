            I have had my Dark Emerald Green 2000 Accord EX Coupe for just at a month now. I got the 4cyl engine with the five-speed transmission along with the gorgeous Ivory leather interior. This car is flat out gorgeous, it may not be the biggest eye catcher out there but in my eyes it is a very good design. 

While the four-cylinder engine may not have the power of the V6 it has more than enough power to get out of its own way. The shifter is one of the smoothest I have ever used; each shift is short and crisp. I let my wife drive the car before we purchased it and she has only been behind the wheel of a 5sp twice before in her life, would you like to know how many times she stalled it, zero, nada, none. It has to be one of the easiest cars to drive that I have ever been in.

The Accord is also dead quite on the streets even at 85+ highway speeds the motor is almost silent and there is almost no wind noise. We looked at many other similar cars like the Maxima, the Solara, the 626, and countless others but the Accord has to be the best value out there. All of my friends think it is a $30,000 car, they all about drop dead in shock when I tell them it was only $19,00.

I cannot comment on reliability yet but if it is anything like my last three Hondas it will rarely see the inside of a shop except for oil changes.

Only draw back I feel the Accord and Honda in general has is the warranty. Many of Hondas competitors have gone to a longer warranty term like a 5year/50k mile or even 10year/100k mile term. Lets face it we all know Hondas are very reliable so they don't need the extended warranty but it would be nice to have.
