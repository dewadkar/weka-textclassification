             The Mazda Protege LX handles well. It's a smooth and quiet ride. It has power locks and windows. It also has a child lock feature on the doors and windows. The sound system is very good. I also like the fact that there is a lever inside for both the gas tank and trunk. The car has excellent pick up and go.

 The only thing I don't like is that on the passenger side the window or door doesn't sound like it's sealed tightly. You can feel a bit of a breeze. Other than that I have no complaints.

 I bought this vehicle because I liked the way it handled and looked. It has cruise control which is a MUST for long trips!
 I wouldn't recommend the car for large families. It is an excellent car for small families!
 The car gets wonderful gas mileage which is a must in this day and age!!!!!<br><br>
