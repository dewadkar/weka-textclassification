            One of my buddies was given this car by his Aunt.  To say the least, it is a lemon.

I am writing this review assuming that all Eclipses are not as bad as this one.

First of all, Mitubishi is the mutt of the automobile industry, owned by one of the companies owned under the Chrysler Corp., and build out of a Ford factory, it took a long time to even figure out where to purchase the parts to fix it.  The back seat is rediculous.  I am 5 foot 7 inches, and I cannot sit comfortably in the rear seat.  I hit my head on even the tiniest of bumps.  The rear seat belts fold away for carrying five people, but the center is raised, making it even easier to end up with a headache.  Mitsubishi definitely should have considered making this car either a two seater sports car or a station wagon instead of trying to make it sit five.  A door handle was broken off in a theft attempt, and a replacement is $100 dollars.  The 2.0 liter non-turbo engine gets up and goes for a non-turbo 2.0 liter engine.  It is not awe-inspiring, nor is it preppy, but doggy does not come to mind when discribing the power.

The timing belt broke, sending the four pistons into eight of the valves.  Not pretty.  A reconditioned engine was under $1,000 though.  The starter appears as if to change it, you would have to pull the engine.  Mitsubishi did a good job of not cramming the biggest engine they could into a small compartment, and there is still a little bit of room to work on it.

If you plan on moving more than one friend around, this car is not recommended.  Assuming that his problems with the engine are purely because the car was abused, the 16 valve, DOHC engine puts out adequate power for a beginners car.<br><br>
