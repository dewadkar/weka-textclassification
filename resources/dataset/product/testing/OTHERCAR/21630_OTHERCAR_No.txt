            My parents bought my Gran Jeep Cherokee Laredo when I turned sixteen because it is big and safe.  I loved my car precisely because I felt completely secure in it.  I thought the car could do anything and go anywhere.  However, I would recommend leasing a Jeep.  After about three years of no problems at all the car's breaks had to be replaces.  Next, the driver's side door began to leak.  By 1999, the car was stalling and it was an automatic.  Granted I was not the most dilligent when it came to cleaning my car but I never was in an accident and I always brought it in for service and the car still fell apart so be warned.<br><br>
