            I began this journey about 6 months ago, reading everything I could get my hands on about the new 2003 Honda Accord.  From magazines to newspapers, my search for information and evaluations was unlimited in scope, ranging from the predictable (Motor Trend, Car & Driver) to the less obvious (Washington Post, Detroit Free Press, USA Today).  Of particular interest were the many reviews I read about the Accord on the Internet.

The end of my journey came this past week when I took delivery on a 2003 Honda Accord EX-L Sedan, 4 cylinder, 5-speed manual.  Interestingly, although I have been an avid test driver of cars for nearly 30 years, I decided on this car before ever having set foot inside it, based largely on the quality and quantity of reviews I was able to gather on the Internet.

I have not been disappointed.  The quality of materials, fit, finish, luxury and solid feel is impressive.  In the 15 years or so that my family has owned Honda vehicles (this is my third -- the first two being a 1992 Prelude SI and a 1995 Civic EX Sedan), the car has risen from economical boxshape to flowing luxo-sedan with all the amenities one would usually expect from a eurocruiser.

My only criticism is the handling, which I expected to be a little crisper and nailed down.  Instead, I find that it "floats" somewhat over bumps and undulations, much different from the experience in my 1995 Civic which handled such road imperfections with poise and elan.

Overall, though, there is very little to complain about.  The four cylinder engine winds smoothly and powerfully, the transmission shifts cleanly in a short, direct and linear fashion.  There is ample room for passengers, front and rear, the trunk is pleasantly large, and the stereo and ventilation controls make long-distance cruising a pleasure.
