            In the past, I've owned land yachts like Oldsmobiles, Cadilacs and Thunderbirds...big cars with power and all the whistles and bells you can imagine. After a while, these cars became money big pits. I wanted a simple car, a reliable car, a basic car...car. I've owned Chrysler - Plymouth cars in the past and I never had any problems with any of them. I have to admit, at first I was looking for a car that stood out in the crowd but from the outside, most of the cars looked like they came from the same mold. I was getting married and planning on staring a family, I needed a reliable car with alot of room and some visual appeal. My 1996 Breeze was the answer to my prayers.   When you first sit behind the wheel you take notice of the incredible view of the road in front of you. I have to admit it takes a little getting used to. I was used to seeing 6+ feet of hood in front of me.
Now I say &quot;Hey you can see the street in front of you&quot;.  The car handles great, Its wide footprint gives the Breeze great handling and stability.
The interior is nice and comfortable and all the controls within easy reach and the gauges are easy to view and it comes standard with dual airbags and child safety locks on the back doors.  The back seat also folds down to expand the trunk space.  I'll never forget the look on the deli clerks face when he saw me put an 8 foot party sandwich into my trunk. 
Like any car basic maintenance is important.  Outside of a tune-up and a few oil changes and gasoline, that's the only money I've spent over the past 4 years. I've put over 60,000 miles on my Breeze and it has been very reliable.  It's peppy little 4 cylinder is good on gas mileage with 23 miles per gallon in city driving. Everything under the hood is clearly marked with easy access to just about everything. It's my little Big car.<br><br>
