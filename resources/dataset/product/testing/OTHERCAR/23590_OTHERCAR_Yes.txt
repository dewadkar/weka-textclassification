DECEMBER UPDATE: After putting 2000 miles on this car, I am happy to say that this is one terrific car.  How many speeding tickets? Nada. But, that's only because I have been very lucky. The one thing that I did not anticipate with this car (since it is just a four door sedan) is the attention it gets. Everytime I pull up to a restaurant, the attendants seem to fight over who gets to  valet park the &quot;I S.&quot; One guy pulled up next to me and just started staring at the car, while he was driving. Some of the attention this car gets is due to the new styling, but it's also due to the car's good looks. I am sure some BMW owners will smirk. Well, if they want to race an I S, they'll have to catch up to one first (especially those pushing the 325 into the shop). 

Perhaps, I did not get into the details of why I think this car performs better than the 330 sedan in my original review? Well, as I mentioned, this car handles wonderfully. It takes sharp or wide turns at a constant speed without loss of control, the 17&quot; tires provide terrific traction, and somehow Lexus has produced a car that lets you feel the road without forsaking the ride one expects in a luxury sports sedan. The brakes feel firm and perform responsively (perhaps too well). The electronic power control enahnces speeding, I mean, passing when you want highly responsive shifting from the automatic. You could also use the manual shift on the steering wheel for direct control over shifting, although I think steering wheel shiting is a little awkward.

It seems that many of the know-it-all professional reviewers have insisted that the new sports sedan, the Lexus IS300, is aimed directly at the potential BMW 3-series buyer. If so, consider the IS300 an Instant Success (is that what IS stands for?). You will love driving this car!

First, the usual drill: the 3.0 liter engine is an in-line 6, twin cam, with four valves per cylinder and continuously Variable Valve Timing. The IS300 has 215 horses and is pretty torquey with 218 lb-ft of torque.  Sure, these specs are pretty impressive up against most of the BMW 3-series line for 2001, including the 325 (the old and outdated 328) and the 330, but what sets this car apart is its handling and sporty performance. With an M.S.R.P. at around $31,500, you cannot buy this much performance and handling in a refined sedan for $30,000 anywhere else. Although the IS300 is new, you need not worry about whether Lexus got this car right straight out the gate. They did. They packed it with the GS300 engine, gave it the reliability of rear wheel drive, and appear to have copied or borrowed other touches and add-ons right from the Germans. Even so, I do not consider this car a  knock-off or imitation, it has its own sporty look (not as choked up or boxy as the 325) and when you drive this car, you feel the road and enjoy the feel. 

What is this car really like to drive? Well, you can get the IS300 in automatic transmission with the manual shift (called E-shift by Lexus) on the steering wheel. I do not drive race cars so putting the manual shift on the steering wheel is an awkward experience for me. I would prefer the shift on the stick.

Inside the car, the interior has a retro look with analog tach. and meters. There is one analog reading that measures something like driving speed, but not driving speed. No one at Lexus could explain what it really measures and the owner's manual was equally evasive. This is symptomatic of the only flaw I have discovered with this car's design; too many gadgets requiring too many button pushes to do too many things. 

I suspect even James Bond would say &quot;give me a break!&quot; Hmm...well, maybe he wouldn't.  There are nice features in some of these gadgets. The standard sound system is good (not great - - and I am told that one should stay away from the Lexus sound system upgrade too), but the CD player is quite good. You can play 6 CDs without getting out of your car, and they did not rip out the tape player to give you the CD player.  You get both, which means your portable minidisk player will work in your car too, if you plug in an adapter. In addition, the the audio system has a few automated features that allow you to tune in new radio stations when driving from city to city with the push of a single button. There is also a single button traffic station feature too.

There is a single button, called &quot;snow,&quot; which puts the car immediately in second gear so you can obtain better traction for driving over snow. Right next to that button is a button called &quot;power,&quot; which provides &quot;better&quot; gear shifting at lower rpms to assist you in passing state troopers or other slow drivers on the interstate. This button definitely reduces your fuel efficiency (and this car is not great on fuel efficiency), but if you want to boost performance from shifting, I would recommend using the E-shift unless you find this awkward. Of course, at high speeds this should not be an issue anyway so I am unsure what the power button really does; very little that I can detect. There is also a button to push for enhanced traction control.

&quot;Keyless&quot; entry is standard. The remote buttons are on the key, however, so it is not exactly key-less. You need your key, but the key, itself, does not need to unlock the door using the keyhole. I draw attention to this distinction because putting the remote buttons on the key is a nice idea, but the buttons are small and unlocking all of the doors requires hitting the same button twice, but not too fast. In other words, I think the keyless entry key is a nice idea, but its implementation is rather awkward. Unlocking the trunk does not unlock the doors, not even the driver's door. Sometimes, the doors do not lock when turning the ignition or unlock when disengaging the key and yadda, yadda, yadda. I am sure you'll discover the glitches of keyless entry. Once you learn to adapt to the idiosyncracies of this system (which appears to be different from others I have had), I doubt that you will fret over the safety of your car. The security is solid, but it's also awkward.

Of course, this IS a Lexus so there are those touches of &quot;luxury.&quot; You can get all leather seats. (One car mag. was mistaken in its review, the seats ARE leather, but there is considerable debate over what fabric is interwoven in the leather. In fact, the leather is soft and very comfortable. The seats are heated). The sun rook, if you purchase that option, is fully automatic. The gear shift and floor pedals are retro silver (very sleek), the driver and front passenger seats adjust in any and every direction you could desire by pushing or pulling on a button. The back seats are roomy enough with a space for a child seat protector and two adults. This is a compact, however. The heating and air conditioning can be controlled by setting the desired temperature. The lights are autosensored so you never need worry about leaving your lights on again. And, of course, when you buy a Lexus, you get that Lexus service that really sets those dealerships apart from eveyone else!
