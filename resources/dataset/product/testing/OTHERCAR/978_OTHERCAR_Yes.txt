            I own a 2003 Matrix Base model manual trans. This review is very much performance oriented, at the end I'll give a review of modifications on this car.

HANDLING - The chasis of the car is very rigid, and the stock suspension is slightly stiffer than what one might expect. This is a plus for me, but bumpy ride for others. There are some body roll in the rear, which stiffer springs or anti roll bar will fix. The weight distribution on this car seems to be pretty balanced, slightly more to the front, which is good for FWD car. I've known some people who autocross this car and is able to get real competitive in the game. If you are looking for a chasis that has competition potential w/ cargo room, this is one.

SOUND PROOF - In my opinion, this car has a fair amount of wind/road noise when driving at freeway speed. Sound insulation is not engineered well. For this reason, the sound system does not work well, due to the noise. On Matrix owners forums, frequently people will spend 300 bucks to sound proof the whole car.  A possible reason for the bad sound insulation is the light weight of this car, 2500lbs is really light for car of this size, which is good for acceleration.

INTERIOR - Rear cargo area is covered by plastics that scratches easily. Even the bottom of the trunk is just plastic instead of carpet. Of course, you may spend $50 for a piece of rear carpet. I find the rear panels of my rear seats, trunk area to be scratched up beyond fixable quickly. The rest of the car is acceptable.

COCKPIT - I like the futuristic cockpit, the design of the air vents are excellant, because it will not trap dust and makes the car looks old. This is subjective anyway. Nothing fundamentally wrong with the cockpit.

Driving position - Ackward. The steering wheel seems to be too far forward. I can either get my arm comfortable while sacrificing leg comfort or vice versa. I am a 1.8 m 160lbs person. I think the seating is ideal for a 1.6-1.75m person.

Seats - The seats are comfortable to sit on for long distance driving. The cushioning is just right. However, it is no sports seat. Along with the ackward driving position, I get thrown off balance while driving aggressively. This is a major bummer for me. This car is designed with an sporty image, and yet the seats are not sports oriented. Aftermarket sports seats will cost alot of money.

ENGINE - I had 15000 miles of experience on this engine. This engine is louder than average from outside the car, but from inside, it is acceptable.  The louder engine does not imply a lower quality engine.  I know people who put 10PSI of turbo and runs it reliably. This is a major feat signifying the durability and quality of the engine. I trust this engine to be very reliable over many years, at least 200,000 miles.

ACCELERATION - is quite sufficient on a manual transmission matrix. It has more power engine than Honda Civic, but heavier and has bigger air resistant. So it won't  be faster than a Civic or Corolla, but quite comparable.

GAS MILEAGE - During the whole time, the gas consumption never went below 30mpg even with aggressive driving, and ranges up to 34mpg.


PERFORMANCE MODS
Having a good chasis, many manufacturers has made performance upgrades on the car.
Stage 0 - stock 130hp
Stage 1 - Cold Air intake(TRD, AEM, Cosmos) + Cat back exhaust(Magnaflow) 150hp
Stage 2 - UNICHIP or piggy back ECU 160hp
Stage 3 - TRD Supercharger(retain warranty) 180hp
          or
          Custom turbo 10psi, intercooled, 230hp or more

Tein has made coil overs for this car for competition quality handling.
