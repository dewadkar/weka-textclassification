            The Dodge Intrepid is the most comfortable car i have ever driven.The room and size of the car is not to big or to small. When i was looking to buy a newer car i looked at a lot of them. I saw the Intrepid in a used car lot and right then i knew it was the one. a sporty looking car with the size and feel of a luxury car. I feel protected in this car and it runs so quiet and so smooth. I will never own another car besides the Dodge Intrepid. Good gas mileage, low maintenance, and all the little gadgets we love in our cars. Any person with a family that want a car and not a mini van should consider this car. It seats five very comfortably. Mine also has a built in car seat, and air bags. The word Intrepid means &quot;fearless&quot; and that is exactly what this car is. Mine has a v6 engine and it moves quick for a v6. My husband was astonished when he saw how fast it could get into traffic and on the highways. I just cant say enough about this car. I love it. I think more people should consider it. <br><br>
