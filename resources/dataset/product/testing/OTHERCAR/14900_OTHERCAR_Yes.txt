            I replaced my old Mavica fd-5 with this one and ITS alot better than the old.  I love the quality in the pictures compared with the older one. I have friends that have bought the more expensive models but they all say the same thing, WISH I STAYED WITH THE FD-71 series. 

I use this camera for selling antiques online and its the easiest I have found for taking pictures.  No Cords to plug in No scsi cards needed. 
Easy to use   even my 72 year old mother uses it when she wants to take pictures in the garden, so ITS GOTTA BE EASY TO USE  Its basically a point and click camera with ZOOM.
