            The S110 is the best ultra compact digital camera you can buy.  You can't find one any smaller, so it wins hands down in that category.  It also takes great pictures; as good most other 2 MP cameras more than twice its size.  The size is what makes this camera so great.  You can put it a shirt or coat pocket and take it anywhere.  You don't get tired of lugging it around.  Because you have it with you, you will use it and enjoy it more.  Also, you won't be afraid to carry it because its built like a tank; you can't hurt it
It has limited manual controls (+ or - 2 on exposure and several white balance options) but probably more than enough for most people.  The files are only saved as JPEG files (although you can pick from 3 compression settings and 3 picture sizes) and a TIFF option would be nice.  But, this isn't a pro camera, and the pictures you will take with it probably do not need to be saved as TIFF. Most of us would only use the JPEG anyway to save space on the Compact Flash card.  It only comes with an 8 MG card but will take up to a 128 MG, which cost under $75 these days.  

It has only a 2X digital zoom which seemed adequate for the shots I have taken.  The S300 (about 1/2 inch larger) with 3X optical and 2.5 digital zoom might be a better investment if zoom is more important to you than smallest size.  The battery held up for several dozen outdoor shots, but if you are going to be taking a lot of flash pictures, an extra battery would be a good investment.

The included software is very good and easy to use.  The "stitching" program which lets you combine up to 7 pictures taken on the S110 into one very wide panorama is great.  The S110 has a special mode for taking the series of pictures you later combine.  

All in all, a great little camera for traveling, vacationing, parties, etc.,  which is what most of us need a camera for in the first place.
