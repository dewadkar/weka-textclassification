            I bought this camera for taking digital images for web design clients.  The convenience of a floppy disk eliminates the need for software or cable connections to view the pictures instantly on any computer.  

Although I hate to part with it for any length of time, I have lent out my FD-95 to many amateur friends and even a professional photographer; all had great things to say.  Novices enjoyed the ease of use while the professional loved the features that are found on high-end film cameras, including the manual focus.

The greatest thing about this camera is that you can &quot;grow&quot; into it.  You don't have to use all the features to take a picture, but you can learn as you gain experience and don't have to buy another &quot;higher quality&quot; camera.

The file sizes are impressively small for the quality the camera produces.  Even the video mode that can record up to 60 seconds offers superb resolution and sound quality.

The camera is a bit pricey compared to other cameras, but for the ease of use and quality that comes with it, it is more than worth it.

I HIGHLY recommend this camera to photographers of ALL levels, from Beginning to Pro.<br><br>
