            It was with a naive optimism that I gave in to the hype and bought the New Beetle when it came out in '98.  How I wish I'd listened to my father and bought a boring old Honda or Toyota instead.

My happiness with the car was all too short-lived, and it wasn't long before the dream became a nightmare.  What I've experienced since very early on is an endless series of problems, not only with the car, but with dealer service.  Headlights and blinkers work and don't work; get one changed, the other goes out.  Think about it:  How many Beetles have you seen on the road with one headlight out?  

Four radios fried so far, and it needs another as I write this.  Car dies out at highway speed in the left lane for no apparent reason?  Well, says dealer service, the ECM (Engine Control Module) - "the brain of the car" - died; no explanation, but we replaced it.  Major, major electrical problems are suggested.

Pickup is extremely spotty; poor shifting (automatic) at low speed and heavy drag when gas is let up both on local roads and highway.  It's no wonder VW shifted production back to Europe after '98.  The car is a lemon through and through, and if VW had any ethics at all, they'd issue a recall of the '98's.

Above all, the dealers make the experience horrendous.  They seem not to have learned the concept of customer service.  The salesman tries to pass off a model with options that weren't ordered, trying, of course, to charge extra for the unexpected additions.  Then, you find out that the comprehensive warranty you spent an extra 1500 bucks on isn't as comprehensive as the salesman represented ("Well," says the service manager in explaining why the customer has to pay for services despite the salesman's representation that "everything" would be covered by the super extended warranty, "that's Sales and this is Service.  They'll say anything to get a sale").

They take up to a week to work on the car, then the things they worked on break as you're driving it home from the garage.  I had to take my dealer to small-claims court to get back the money I paid them for my last set of botched repairs; they didn't so much as acknowledge the letters I sent detailing the problems I encountered after picking up the car.  Incompetent, unresponsive, lackadaisical service personnel and managers make for an infuriating experience.

If you buy this car, you're an idiot.  I'll be looking to dump mine as soon as it's paid off. 

Suckers Wanted.
