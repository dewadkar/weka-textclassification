            The Chevrolet Blazer provides a great mid-level sport utility experience.  The Blazer is priced competitively with the Ford Explorer and the Dodge Durango.  The thing that I like the best about the Blazer is that it provides roominess with a combination of affordability.  The front seating is arranged comfortably so that the controls are easily reached, but the dash isn't sitting on top of your lap.  The gauges are easy to read and the radio is easily managed while driving down the road.

The rear seating is equally up to the task.  Three can fit comfortably across the back row with ample knee room.  Child seats fit easily at all three locations.  Chevrolet provides a ratcheting three point seat belt for the outside seating that works great for car seats.  Just pull the belt out all the way, attach the clip into the safety latch, and then allow the belt to tighten up on the car seat.  At this point pull the belt tight and the procedure is complete.  The belt is locked into place until it is released from the safety latch.  This alleviates the hassle for the seat belt lock clip.  By the way, all Chevrolet truck products offer this feature!

The Blazer can be epuipped just as plain or plush as your budget will allow.  This makes this vehicle available to a large array of people.  Whether you want cloth or leather, or even a sunroof, Chevy Blazer offers it all.

The best thing that I like about the Blazer is the incentivized deals that comes from GMAC and General Motors, Inc.  If you are looking to purchase, then low interest rates and/or rebates are available for low monthly payments.  If like me, you want to lease your vehicles, then you will really like the Blazer.  GMAC regularly offers incentivized leases that offer low rates, high residuals, and sometimes rebates all on the same vehicle at the time of your purchase.

I recommend the Chevrolet Blazer.  It's roomy, smooth, powerful, and most of all.....  affordable!!  Happy Driving!!!<br><br>
