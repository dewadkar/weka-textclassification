            BMW has come up with a new categorization in this auto market of seemingly uncategorizable cars.  They call their entry into the SUV market a Sport Activity Vehicle (I call these car-like SUV&#146s).  Unlike a truck based SUV, X5 is more like an overgrown sedan on steroids.  And, as such, it has both the characteristics of an SUV and the popular BMW sport sedans.

This works for me, as I am a driver rather than a rider.  I like dancing through the curves and bashing the gas pedal on a straightaway.  You could, of course, do the same in a regular SUV but you would soon notice that you are riding alfresco in an emergency wheel chair.

With its stiff suspension, but not so stiff that it rides like a sports car, X5 is possibly the best handling SUV I have ever driven.  Its 50-50 weight ratio, and the fact that power is distributed electronicly among the front and rear wheels (62/38 I think) contribute to the fact that this SUV handles much like a sports sedan.

You can shine copper but its still not going to be worth as much as gold.  X5 can&#146t compete with sports cars, or even sport sedans.  It&#146s still a big car, so I wouldn&#146t buy it expecting zig zag performance around the curves. 

Moreover, its also not an off-roader.  With 99% SUV&#146s never getting off asphault, that is not a problem.  But to a buyer these two qualities should mean one thing &#150 X5 neither excels in being a sports sedan nor a heavy duty off-roader.

I wouldn&#146t buy an SUV unless I needed one.  And if I needed one, I wouldn&#146t buy one that handles like a truck.  So to me X5 is an alternative to uncontrollable unsafe SUVS, but can&#146t compare with, lets say, an M3.

Enough philosophy.  Traction Control, Dynamic Stability Control, Hill Descent Control, and a buncha other (Wife?) Controls are some of the goodies that come with this car.  Hill Descent Control is a gimmick that allows for smooth engine breaks that passionate drivers like me effusively perform on a manual tranny.  Most trucks and 18 wheelers need this kind of technology, and its nice to have on your SUV.  

I had the pleasure of driving the 3.0I, with automatic wipers and tinted glass standard.  The 225 HP engine was more than enough for an SUV, but I couldn&#146t help but yearn for more.  The two engines that this baby can have under the hood are things to bloviate about.  4.4L 8cyl with boasts 282 HP and a 3.0L 6cyl with 225 HP.

You aren&#146t going to win any drag races, but the 282HP is definitely going to keep you entertained when you gun it.  225HP I drove?  Well, it sucked, but its more than enough for an SUV.  The HP gain on the 4.4L X5 does not come cheap, unfortunately.  For starters, it&#146s a 10k in price difference.  That is a lot to pay for 60Hp, but the X5 does come with additional standard goodies like chrome wheels and some other useless jumbo.

In any event, if I were in the market for an SUV and had the financial resources for it, I would definitely opt for the 8 cyl X5.  It&#146s an SUV for a driver who simply needs to buy an SUV.  Hardly an alternative for your Sunday ride, but it&#146s the cr�me de la cr�me compared to other SUV&#146s.
