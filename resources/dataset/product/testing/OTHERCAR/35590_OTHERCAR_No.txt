             I only found out about this one after I wrecked my beloved mini-van so it's a rental for me. What do I like about this car?? The looks it's sporty, compact, easy to manuver. Also on the steering wheel there is a cute little feature that allows you to control the settings and volume on the radio/cdplayer. I like the sporty feel of it when I am driving it. Don't feel like I do in my mom-mobile. :-) 

What I don't like is the fuel efficency of it. I can drive 435 miles from where I live now to my parents home in the mini-van on one tank of gas. In the Suzuki Grand Vitara it took a tank and a half. Another down fall to the Vitara is that you feel nearly every bump in the road definately not a smooth ride. It's also not as roomy as I am used to. I would definately not recomend this for someone who has three kids like myself or for someone who travels alot from what I can see it is an affordable buy compared to other cars today. However the money you'd save on the cost would definately easily be spent in fuel costs. And let's face it with the cost of gas these days fuel efficiency is a must. 

Cost of rental 250.00 for about 3 weeks. (thank goodness the insurance picked up the rest.)
Cost of gas about 80.00 all together.
