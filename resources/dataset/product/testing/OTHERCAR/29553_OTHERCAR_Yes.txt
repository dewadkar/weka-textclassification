            The 4Runner Limited is a great all-around SUV, despite its higher-than-necessary price when purchased new from a dealer. 

<b>What I love about the 4Runner Limited:</b> The ride is great - no troubles handling curves, mountain roads, etc. at higher speeds. The seating is very comfortable and I especially love the heat warmers (a must in cold climates!) :)  The sound system is excellent and having a 6 CD changer is a nice perk. The 4Runner is low-maintenence and very reliable.

<b>What could be improved:</b> I initially found it awkward to get in and out of the car, although I eventually found a rhythm to it. The overall price was too high compared to similar vehicles from other manufacturers. The cupholders are one size only which is annoying when you have a large cup.
