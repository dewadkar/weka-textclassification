            I purchased my 1997 Grand Cherokee Laredo new in December 1996.  Options include Up Country Suspension, Towing Package, V8, AWD, and limited slip rear differential.  Early in its life, I used it extensively off-road and in heavy Vermont snow during ski trips.  The Laredo handled everything beautifully and made my wife and I feel safe in all conditions.  It now has 164,000 miles and is still going strong.

There is a key to trouble free Jeep ownership.  You must perform routine maintainence and in particular, change transmission, axle and engine oils regularly.  Jeeps are known for premature transmission failure but mine has been trouble free.  I changed trans fluid every 15K miles.  This is close to the recommended interval for severe duty.  I suspect you could let it go every 25K-30K but make sure it is done.  If you are buying used, look for maintenance records.

Another important area is the suspension bushings, sway bar end links, and track bars.  They tend to wear out between 75k-100k miles.  The symptoms include knocking sounds and increased body sway on crowned roads.  I replaced all of these components around 120k miles and it made a huge difference in ride and handling.  My 97 rides better than many newer Grand Cherokees with lower mileage.

Basically, if you take care of your Jeep, it will reward you with many trouble free miles.  If you don't, expect big bills after 100k miles.
