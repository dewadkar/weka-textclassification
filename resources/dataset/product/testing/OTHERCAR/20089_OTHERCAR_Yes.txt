            When looking into buying a used car, I really tried to do my homework.  I did research with Consumer Reports, Edmunds, Car and Driver, etc.  The last thing I wanted was to be unprepared when I stepped onto the used car lot.  As a young woman shopping for a car by herself, I didn't want a salesperson to stereotype me as a person who could be sold on a car with vanity mirrors, interior colors, and the &quot;cuteness&quot; quotient.

The research I'd done suggested that the Mazda Protege 1995 DX model I was looking at had an excellent reliability record, low defect percentage, and was a good value for the money.  A little scared, I made the Mazda my very first car.

Since the purchase over two years ago, I've been very pleased!  It runs well, is reliable, and definitely gets the job done.  There are a few things, however, that I wish I'd paid more attention to.  The cup holders (two in the front) are completely inadequate.  When I put my car in park, the gear shift smashes into the cup sitting in the holder, making a huge mess if you're not paying attention.  Also, the interior fabric (mine is a fairly light beige color) tends to stain easily.  Most people would say, &quot;Duh!  Of course a light fabric will stain easily!&quot;  But just keep in mind that the nature of the fabric makes it difficult to clean and keep clean.  Stains definitely don't lift right out.

Overall, I think the Mazda Protege is a great deal for the money and would be well suited for someone who wants a fairly small, reliable, basic car, and isn't terribly worried about having a bunch of fancy bells and whistles.  If you're looking for a luxury, look somewhere else.  <br><br>
