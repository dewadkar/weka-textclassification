               We bought a used 95 Kia Sportage in December of 98.   My wife got a job up in the foothills, and we needed a dependable vehicle to get her there. We decided she needed 4 wheel drive because it snowed in the winter. We went to a dealer who guaranteed to finance anyone.

    While I was in talking to the sales person about the finance program, my wife walked out front and right up to a Kia Sportage.  It had 21,000 miles on it and just happened to be in a group of vehicles reserved for the program. That was the vehicle she wanted, and that was the vehicle she got!  By March of '99, it had 48,000 miles on it, and other than oil changes and changing the coolant it had been problem free.

     We got a recall notice about the catalytic converter, and the dealer changed it at no charge.  We found it to be too light for driving on snow: it doesn't get good traction. However, putting a tool box and a floor jack in back took care of that.  Also, if you have teen age drivers in the house, the insurance goes through the roof. 

It handles nicely, gets great mileage, and is quiet.   <br><br>
