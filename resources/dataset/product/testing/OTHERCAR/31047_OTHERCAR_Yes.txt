            I bought this vehicle because its safety and crash statistics stood out above all other luxury cars, not to mention it's sleek, elegant body style.  The ride in this car is so smooth, you'll fall asleep if you're not careful because you don't think the car is moving.  It's also so quiet that you sometimes have to open the door to make sure you cranked it! :)  It's a very nic eride with good features--heated seats, woodgrain paneling, BOSE sound system (an excellent one).  The only thing that could be improved would be leg room...it's kind of cramped on the driver's side.<br><br>
