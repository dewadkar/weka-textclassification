            I originally was shopping for a 2001 Maxima, thinking that dealers would be eager to cut a good deal on those still unsold. I drove a 2001 SE with essentially all options (leather, auto climate control, etc.; sticker was north of $29k) and liked the car, but the dealers here didn't move as much on the price as I'd expected. So I decided that the money would be better spent on a new Maxima with fewer options selected. 

I chose a glacier-white/grey cloth SE with a sunroof, but avoided some of the pricier options like leather and the newly offered navigation system. But I gained the 3.5L 255 hp V6, and the power difference can be readily noticed. Also gained were xenon headlamps, a trip computer, slightly revised interior/dash, and other more subtle changes.

The car has a firm, but comfortable ride, and the overall quality is unmatched at a mid 20's price. Power is ample. I haven't seen an 'official' road test, but I suspect 0 - 60 mph, even with the automatic, is in the low-mid 6 second range. Highway speeds and passing are effortless. Handling, for a sedan, as excellent... just returned from an afternoon ride in the mountains.  

The only real decision that I debated was whether or not to opt for the Bose audio package. After side-by-side listening, I decided that it wasn't worth the extra $1100. Although the 6 disc in-dash changer was a tempting factor in its favor, the added bass was bloated and flabby. So unless thumping down the street is important to you, I suggest you save your $1100. The standard audio is still superior to most other factory systems, and really isn't much of a step back from the overpriced Bose.
