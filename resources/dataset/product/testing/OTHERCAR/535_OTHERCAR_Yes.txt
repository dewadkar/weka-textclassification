            Everything works and nothing rattles!

I purchased this car based primarily on price ($8303 plus tax from an internet-based seller) and length of its warranty. 

This car is ideal for city and suburban driving, and keeps up on the highway. While I live in the city and do some city driving, most of my mileage comes from long-distance escapes to the forest. Inasmuch as most professional reviewers rate the Accent as &quot;underpowered&quot; for inter-state speeds I was concerned about long distance driving. For me the performance of this car has proved more than adequate. The Accent is no V-8 of course, but it makes it to and maintains interstate speeds with no problem. The manual transmission shifts smoothly.

The Accent does have a bit of a small car ride, but I don't mind this.  

The 2000 Accent has a roomy interior. I am 6'2. Having rented many types of cars in the past few years, I have learned that the inside of a car seems to have no relationship to the exterior. (My head hits the ceiling in a Chevy Monte Carlo for example, and that car is a boat!) Unlike some bigger cars, the Accent has plenty of head room and deep leg room. More than enough room for me. 

Considering that this car is a &quot;no-frills&quot; base unit it has a lot to offer in details. The seats are comfortable, even at long distances. The car is ergonomically designed, has a decent standard am/fm cassette radio, the hatchback trunk is lined and has plenty of space. There is a fold down rear seat. The driver side seat has lumbar support!

The Accent sips gas. I'm getting 40-44 MPG!

On the down side, I don't like the small wheels (with narrow 13 inch tires). The car also rev's a little high at high speeds, enough to be noticeable, though not terribly so.

Oh yeah, it doesn't have imitation burled plastic wood on the dash board. (sigh!)
