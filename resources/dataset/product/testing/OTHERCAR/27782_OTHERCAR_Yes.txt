            I purchased the S100 before the S110 and S300 came out and back then it was the smallest 2.1Megapixel camera around. 

As touted by Canon's advertising this thing is the size of a credit card and about as thick as one and a half decks of playing cards. Nice and small, it can fit in your pocket so you won't mind carrying it around. 

It's constructed mostly of steel so it's pretty heavy for its size though. Of course that makes for greater sturdiness. The unusual thing is that the door for the CF card is made of plastic. Drop it on that corner and you could easily break the plastic door so be careful! 

The LCD on it is clear and I find it to be better than most I've seen. The menu system is simple but could be more intuitive. Buttons on this camera are fairly small but protrude out enough to be easily used. 

The image quality is great. I've found the 2.1MP resolution is ideal for almost all uses and the camera's auto settings adjust well to most environments. The 2X optical zoom is comparable to other cameras in this category but I've been spoiled on the 10X zoom on the old Sony Mavicas so it was a dissappointment for me. Still, it's a great point & click camera for novices. 

Drawbacks are few: The camera only supports CompactFlash type I cards, meaning you can't use IBM Microdrive cards. However, this is becoming irrelevant as CF Type I cards grow in size and drop in price. 

Another thing is the battery life. It really doesn't last as long as you'd like. Turning off the LCD display helps but that's one of the benefits of a digital camera so I like to keep it on. The camera does not accept standard size batteries (like AA or AAA) so I recommend you purchase at least one extra Lithium battery. Good thing Canon uses the same battery for the S110. 

The camera only has three image quality settings. There's 1600x1200 uncompressed, 1600x1200 compressed and then 640x480. There really should be a setting in between there like 1024x768 compressed. Canon should really fix with a firmware update. 

Unfortunately the camera kit does not come with a case so you'll have to go search for one yourself. When I purchased the camera the cases were very difficult to find. Canon's site lists the PSC-100 case which is nice and can hold an extra battery or CF card. However, I've found that there's another case from Canon which gives faster access to the camera. It's a black leather case that holds the camera so that it's standing up on it's side. It closes with a flap so it's simple to open and yank out the camera. I use it more than my PSC-100 case. 
 
Like almost all digital cameras nowadays it only comes with a small memory card, just enough for you to play with the camera to see that it works. Go buy yourself a bigger CF card with the camera. 

Overall, with the addition of a couple extra batteries and a larger CF card this camera is great for almost all uses. Highly recommended.
