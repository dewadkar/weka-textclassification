            Not too long ago, my wife got word that her grandmother had passed away, and we had to make a trip to Kentucky for the funeral. Since both our cars are over 100,000 miles and the price of two tickets over $1000 , we decided to rent a car and drive down there. My wife's search for rates led us to a 2001 Dodge Stratus for a decent rate.

The car we rented was dark blue. I thought it looked pretty good. The seats are comfortable, and all the controls are in good spots. The instrumentation is easy to read.

One of the big negatives I noticed is that the car has a huge blind spot on the driver's side. It's hard to see when you're changing lanes, almost impossible. Another thing I didn't like about the car is that the roof sticks out a little far. It's like having a cover over your eyes, and for some traffic lights you have to lean forward to watch see them when you're stopped right at the line. I only have one more simple complaint: the trip counter. It may seem silly, and it was a minor annoyance, but I like to use the trip counter to keep track of how far I've gone with a tank of gas. The digital trip counter/ odometer kept reverting to the odometer when I turned the car off. No big deal, but I would have liked it to stay on the trip counter instead of having to push the button every time I start the car.

All the little things I didn't like about the car aside, I can say I was impressed. The six cylinder engine was very responsive, and had no problem with the hills of West Virginia. I know my little Mazda would have struggled. I was able to maintain speed up the hills, even accelerate.

The steering was tight and responsive, and the brakes were steady. Combined with the engine, I would say this car handled very well, almost sporty. Though most of our drive was on the interstate system, it handled just as well in town.

I would say that the GM stereo system was pretty good.

Storage room was really good. Though we only took enough with us for a few days, coming back the trunk and back seat were crammed to capacity. I would say that we were able to fit a lot in the car.

I can't really say much about the car, since I only had it a week. I think if I was in the market for a car, I would give the Dodge Stratus consideration.
