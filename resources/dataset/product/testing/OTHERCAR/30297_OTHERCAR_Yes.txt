            I will skip over the feature lists and such for the Avalanche and focus on the outstanding and the mundane, and compare to the competition.

The Interior:

Basically, as far as I can tell, there are no differences between the Avalanche interior and that of the Silverado, Suburban, Tahoe, as well as the GMC counterparts. I bought mine with premium leather seating surfaces and all the extras, which really makes for a very luxurious cabin, though the heavy usage of plastic does tend to detract a little from the overall feel. In all fairness, I have been in a number of late model luxury sedans and felt pretty much the same way. Removing the fake leather texturing in the plastic and rubberizing it instead would look and feel much nicer, and also have some additional practicality as things like sunglasses, cel-phones, etc. wouldn't slide around in turns on a rubberized surface.

I would have preferred to see a standard Double-DIN sized radio, but I am sure that after so many years of both GM and Chrysler having these oddly sized radios, that idea just wouldn't fly with GM's management. Nonetheless, the CD Stereo though simple, has all the basic features one would expect, minus all that extra gimmickery found in aftermarket stereo front end units. The OnStar service came with the Driver Convenience package, and though I will not likely upgrade to the cellular phone service plan, it is nice that at the push of a button, I can reach a technician to help resolve engine problems should they arise, or get emergency services personnel on the scene quickly. 

To lower the midgate, one first needs to fold the rear seat bottoms up, and the rear seat backs down, which is basically easy, though I can't help but think that GMs engineers could have done a little better in dealing with the rear headrests as they do tend to make it a little bit more difficult to lower the seat backs with the front seats in their normal (for me, at 5'9" tall anyhow) position. Perhaps they could have devised some way for the headrests to fold forward and tuck under the seat when folded, but this is just me picking nits. A bigger complaint, and one I can see easily improved upon, is that when the midgate is folded, there isn't anything aside from the plastic armor of the rear seat bottoms (remember, they are folded up against the rear of the front seats) to prevent loads from hitting the front seats. Those this is functional, I can't help but imagine that a fold up panel on the midgate would have been more appropriate. However, this shortcoming just leaves room for a smart aftermarket products maker to fill the gap... literally!

While I am on this topic, I had a thought on how to dramatically improve the midgate functionality and make it easier to change too... I got the idea when reading about a GMC show truck with an extendable cargo bed. In this GMC concept, the tailgate, bed and sides all extended out (I assume electrically) to lengthen the bed. My idea turns that around and would have the bed extend in the same manner INTO the cabin after folding the seats. The obvious advantage would be that there is no chance of the cargo coming in contact with the door panels, seat backs, etc, short of overflowing the bed rails themselves. Are any GM engineers listening?

The Exterior:

Styling opinions aside, the Avalanche is really just a Suburban with a convertible cargo bed instead of a rear seat. It has a dramatically different persona on the exterior due to the aggressive and sharp edged creases of the body panels and the durable and practical plastic body armor along the lower quarters. My first thought when seeing a picture of the the Avalanche was that it looked tacky with all the plastic down there, but when I encountered one of these beasts in a parking lot, I immediately fell in love. It caught my attention out of the corner of my eye in a Home Depot parking lot (it's natural weekend roost I'd wager), and when I turned to see what was trying to get my attention, I was greeted with the most aggressive front end treatment I have seen on any vehicle short of a futuristic sci-fi film. Photos just don't do this machine any form of justice at all... It has to be encountered first hand for it's styling to be truly appreciated. 

Accessing the cargo area is a breeze, what with foot steps molded into the bumper ends and grab handles on the sides. Removing the three protective cargo panels is a very easy task, though stowing them in the included carrying bag is definately a chore! Maybe I just need to do it a couple dozen times to get it right. I like the lighting in the cargo bed, which also lights up the rather cavernous side storage compartments filling up what would otherwise be unused space between the outer body panels and the cargo bed itself. Speaking of that bed, it's complete with a rubber mat, 2" wide drainage paths and plastic bed liner sides. All combined, it is very durable, preventing dents and scratches in what normally would be a painted bed, and the rubber mat helps to keep cargo in place, though it is a terrible bear to try to push a large heavy cardboard box across the bed floor as the rubber mat does it's job almost too well! I also really like how the tailgate is lockable, and combined with the three caover panels makes for an exceptionally secure cargo area. I only have two real complaints regarding the bed and side cargo compartments. The first being the bed lights switch. It is located in the cabin, on the dash, to the left of the steering wheel. Once again, I can't help but imagine a more logical solution being switches that turn the lights on automatically when the tailgate is lowered (which should be over-ridable of course, when hauling items longer than 8'1"!) and when the side cargo compartments are opened. Would have been simple to do too... This is something that I expect to see done in future Avalanches, if for no other reason that it is so obvious and will undoubtedly will come up in many people's minds. Petty detail? Yes. Worth changing? Certainly! The other has to do with the locks for the tailgate and the side compartments which should have some sort of locking mechanism that locks and unlocks them along with the doors rather than each being individually locking. After having stowed all my emergency equipment and some other stuff in the side compartments, I go into them quite often, and it is a bit annoying to have to get out the key to unlock them.

Summary: 

The Avalanche truly is the best of both worlds. Those being the SUV and the Pickup Truck worlds. You can carry more than any SUV because you can open up the rear end for larger items, and compared to a full size 8' truck bed, you get all but the vertical capacity at the front end. The simplicity of being able to quickly fold the rear seats and drop the midgate for long, low items is amazing... Less than a minute to do. Taking out the rear window and removing the bed cover panels takes a couple minutes more, but only needs to be done for larger items. 

Aside from some very minor shortcomings or oversights, which quite easily were things the engineers tried to incorporate into the final vehicle but were shot down due to costs or something, I have to give the Chevy Avalanche 5 stars.
