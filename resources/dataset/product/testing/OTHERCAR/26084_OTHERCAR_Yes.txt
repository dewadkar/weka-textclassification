I recently (well a year ago) purchased my first new car. I was looking for an entry-level sedan and tried the following cars: NISSAN MAXIMA, TOYOTA CAMRY, HONDA CIVIC, the Saturn and (on a lark) the MAZDA PROTEGE. 

And to my surprise it was the Protege that carried the day. All the cars were pretty much alike...in a nutshell..

Nissan Maxima: Without anything interesting, and rude salesman. Pricey too.

Honda Civic: The nicest of all the cars, felt more luxxurious but ultimately was at least 2500 dollars more than any of the other cars.

Toyota Camry: Nice and reliable....but they couldn't come down in price enough.

The Saturn: GREAT warranty and service. Car sort of boxy. And because there's no bargaining involved, much more expensive than it deserves.

And then there's the Protege. Roomier than the Camry, it seemed to drive a little sportier. But in every other way it was compatible to the Camry (its closest competitor) and t was about a grand cheaper.

So give it a whirl. <br><br>
