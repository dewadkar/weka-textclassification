            I think the new design of the CTS is pretty nice. The car mechanically is awesome. The only mechanical problem I had during my test drive was that the engine should have had more power (especially from a company that has some of the most powerful 8�s and 6�s on the market). But what really impressed me was that GM�s design team loosened up and took some chances. The end product looked nothing like your typical automobile. After carefully looking at the car, I came across a few problems from a proportion stand point. The headlights are the same size (or about the same size) as the part in-between the grill and the headlight. The headlight and that "dead space" are competing because their very close to being the same size and since that�s one of the only parts of the car that is like that it makes the car lack a kind of rhythm. I think if the grill was elongate it will eliminate the tension and give the car a wider appearance. Also the tail lights are too big for the back of the car which makes the back look heavy especial from having the bumper line emphasizes the depth of the taillight also, the top of the bumper where it meets the taillight has a very steep angle which competes against the headlight�s bold line which creates a nice diagonal from the headlight to the top of the back end (from a profile stand point). Another problem I have is with the front fenders. There is too much fender from the top of the wheel to the hood. That needs to be lowered (which will get rid of the tall look it has now). Also shorten the front end a little more because of the same problem the headlight has. The wheel well cuts the fender in half, which gives it an odd competing look. Drag the headlight back and have it follow the contour of the wheel well. It will give the car a more aggressive look. On the inside I would get rid of the wood all together and use more modern materials. The car looks new and edgy you should use materials that echo that. I would also rework the middle console. It makes me feel to claustrophobic. And it stands out more then anything in the car. I think their needs to be more relationships between the outside of the car and the inside.
