            Takes good macro photos. But any shots with high contrast (ie, if there is a skyline) the photos turn out terrible. Some features were not documented in the manual and difficult to figure out. There is NO shock resistence. Dropped the camera from arms length (2 feet) to a carpeted floor and the camera froze up. 

When I called support for help, I was put on hold for 20 minutes (until I hung up) - a recording told me to send them email or visit their website. So I called the ordering department. They answered right away but refused to help me with support and put me back on hold and into the "infinite support loop".

The website said they would not honor the warranty. I assume because I was honest with them and told them I "dropped" the camera. I am very disappointed in their lack of confidence in their own products, terrible service and would caution anyone from purchasing their cameras or any other product for that matter. Try their support line before you buy and see for yourself.
