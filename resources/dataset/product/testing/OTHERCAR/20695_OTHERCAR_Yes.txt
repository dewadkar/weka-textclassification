            My friend recently purchased the 2003 Nissan Pathfinder LE. He got every option except for one, as far as I know. I have been driving with him a lot lately and have often taken the wheel myself. 

The outside of this car is beautiful. My friend got the beige exterior with beige leather seats inside. The car has muscle and looks from the outside and does not lack for wither on the inside. The inside of the car is well designed and matches the outside nicely. 

Not only do the rear seats recline in this car, but the front seats fold back as well so that they are even with the back. This makes for a nice chaise lounge in the car to watch the sunset or the built in video entertainment. 

The seats are not only powered, but they also have memory and heat. There are two different memory positions so that two different drivers can use the vehicle and both easily return to their desired position. The heated seats are also a nice touch, although they do have one problem. When the car shuts off, the seats don&#146t. The manual warns against draining the battery by leaving the seats on with the car off. I don&#146t know why the Pathfinder doesn&#146t automatically shut off the seats, but it is an inconvenience to have to remember to shut them off every time you use them. 

Right when you get in the car is when I experience my first problem. Neither my friend nor myself has yet found a way to make us comfortable. The Pathfinder has power seats so they are easy to adjust, but we haven&#146t found any position that makes us comfortable. We are both just about 6 feet tall and our heads come within 2 inches of the ceiling at all times. There does not seem to be enough legroom in the front no matter how far back the seat goes. And the wheel itself always seems to sit at a low angle with the seat all the way back. 

On the roof of the car, right above the rear view mirror, is a combination temperature gauge and compass. The compass seems reasonably accurate and would no doubt come in handy when lost. The temperature gauge I am not so sure of. Although the temperature only needs to be close and not perfect it still looks bad when the temperature constantly fluctuates 2-3 degrees. 

The gauges and dials are all simple enough to use and see. The steering wheel doesn&#146t block the gauges as sometimes happens on these high-seated cars. The controls for the radio and cruise control are both on the steering wheel, which makes it easy to use those while driving. 

The air is controlled by setting the temperature and then forgetting all about it while the car automatically maintains the desired temperature. Although this is a nice touch on the Pathfinder, I&#146m not sure how well it works. It often seems that the air coming out of the vents is colder than it should be. I often find myself turning the temperature up to 73-74 degrees even though I normally like 69 degrees. This lack of control over the temperature may stem from the same problem that keeps the outside temperature gauge fluctuating. 

The sound system on this car is well equipped. It comes with a 6-speaker, 150-watt system made especially for the Pathfinder by the people at Bose. The system includes a 6-disc in-dash changer that requires no cartridge to run. This makes it easy to load and pleasant to listen to. The system performs wonderfully and sounds great. 

The car drives reasonably well. It doesn&#146t have tons of pep but does have better acceleration than other SUVs I have driven. The 250 horsepower engine can get the car up to speed, but only gives out a modest average of 17 miles to the gallon. The fuel tank is 21 gallons, which lets you go about 300 miles or about 5 days in my case before refueling. 

One of the things I found nicest about this car is the feature they installed to reduce the rolling of the car.  Nissan installed a chip in the Pathfinder that is supposed to use a gyroscope to keep the car upright at all times.  This SUV can actually correct for the roll that is common in top-heavy cars.  We did go around quite a few turns - and many moderately quickly.  I found that the chip really does work.  I noticed that there was considerably less roll than I am used to when in other SUVs on the same roads.
