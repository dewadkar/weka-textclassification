            There seem to be several reviews of the SC on here, but none that would be useful if you were really wanting to buy one, comparing it to the competition.  It's compared to a Lexus RX, a 7-series, a Z3 (twice), and all sorts of other junk.  I can't imagine any of these cars being alternatives for someone who wants a big luxury convertible.  

Let's list the competition.  The only two serious competitors in the GT class (remember, GT used to mean Grand Tourer) are the XK8 and the SL.  If you prefer out-and-out speed and style then Ferrari is a possibility.  If you don't mind terrible build quality and extortionate prices, then the Bentley Azure or Aston Martin Volante (and maybe even Maserati) are possibles too.  If you're more interested in sensible cars and have a limited budget, you're on to Saab and Volvo convertibles, or the CLK convertible, which aren't in this league by virtue of being far too dull.

Also not in this league, although often compared, are "fun" sports cars, from the Boxster/SLK/Z3 price range down to the MX5/Miata and that sort.  But really, they're not even trying to provide the comfort and luxury that a SC/XK/SL owner wants.

As for anything non-convertible, they're not even in the running.  If you're serious about a drop-top, nothing else will do, as you'll know.

So, where does this stand against its real competition?  

Well, the old-shape SL was a good big car, albeit with terrifying depreciation in real life (unlike what they would have you believe about Mercs).  The problem is, no-one wants to buy them from you, and so the split between the terrible offer you'll get from a dealer or the kind of person who'd buy one privately, to the extortionate amounts asked for dubious condition SL's, is enormous.  But enough about money, what about the car?  Too much like a truck, that's the problem.  And, for the money, you really want an interior that looks a little different from a 2-litre diesel Stuttgart taxi.  So long as you choose a 500 model, the engine has enough grunt but not too much weight for the car's handling.  But the roof is a pain.  A complete pain.  The ragtop is thin and flappy -- in earlier versions you can put your hand through the slots where it doesn't fit.  And the hardtop is impossible to fit without at least two people (plus the one to disconnect the rear screen heater when you've forgotten it half-way through).  And where exactly are you supposed to put it?  Add to this the almost universally bad reputation you'll get as an affluent Volvo-driver and it's not a pretty package.

So the new SL?  Well, far better, and it's got the roof from the SLK or SC.  Better, even, as it tucks up and provides more boot space.  But, it has no rear seats.  Now, I know everyone laughs at the rear seat room in the SC, or the old SL, or an XK8, or XJS for that matter, but they're all the same.  That's what a 2+2 is about.  If you want four seats, don't get any of these.  They're ok for *small* kids (but not baby seats), or one adult acrossways for shortish journeys.  And that can be really handy.  But they are great as rear storage.  The old XJS convertible didn't used to have rear seats, and many companies offered to add them (and did).  The model was a lot more successful when it was changed to have 2+2 seats.  Ditto the old SL -- it can be tricky to sell one without the two rear seats, which used to be an option.  I believe that Mercedes are mad to remove them, and it was a big mistake.  It's one of the primary reasons the new SL was off my list.  And then, it's twice the price of the competition.  Something wrong here surely?

Further up the list, there's the XK8.  Now this is an immensely capable car, and a joy to drive (particularly with the additional power of the XKR8).  One of the few cars (perhaps the M5 is another) in which the computer-controlled traction control is absolutely spot-on whether in corners, standing starts, or snow and ice.  It's also much more Jaguar-like than the others (obvious, but something only Jaguar owners will understand).  It's let down only by its hood, which is excellent when up, but doesn't hide like the SL one (as it's so much thicker).  

So we get to the SC at last.  By comparison to the XK8, the roof's a dream.  If you've had an SLK, it's almost identical (although obviously bigger).  It's also quicker and more logical than the XK8 or SLK, in small issues such as that the quarter windows drop simultaneously with the roof, making it quicker.  Like the XK8, you can use the hood at very slow speeds, although not really in traffic like you can with the XK8 as the speed limit is so slow (about 3mph).  Reversing is fine, but it's a bit annoying that it stops when you go too fast and won't restart until you've come to a complete halt.  I don't see why this limit couldn't be raised to 5-10mph or so.  

Like the SLK, the SC has a pull-out slip in the boot to guide you where luggage should be.  The rear tyre takes up half of the remaining boot space, and should be tipped out.  Run-flat tyres remove this spare and are a good option.  Unfortunately some twerp decided to use the same frequency for this function as the ambulance service over here, so we're in one of the few countries where run-flat tyres are not available.  If you don't have them, do what Ferrari do, just chuck out the spare tyre and replace it with a can of instant-tyre-weld stuff, which will get you back to a garage.

The engine's great, not quite as sweet as the XK8, but quieter and considerably more powerful.  The SC is around half-way between the XK8 and the XKR8, which puts it just this side of scary but with more power that you're ever likely to want.  It's certainly got a lot more go than the old SL500, although I have no experience of the new one.  Note: it doesn't FEEL fast, as it's so quiet and the gearbox and suspension handle it so well.  But it certainly is.  If you want a thump in the back, insult your mates at the bar instead.

The stereo (particularly the Mark Levinson option) beats the pants off the Bose premium stereo option in the XK8.  And the wheel controls are better too, IMHO.  Which is handy, as the console controls are a dog.  Fortunately, they're rarely needed, and well hidden behind the nice electric covery thing, which is good for showing off.  

The seats are pretty good -- far better than the trendy looking but terrible ones in the XK8 (my wife is a physiotherapist and was appalled at the useless headrest design).

Normal Lexus touches like the wheel dropping into position as you insert the key are there, but there are several missing items which I hope they'll install in newer models.  This is my current "wish list" of things that they wouldn't have forgotten if they'd either looked at some of the competing cars or had an experienced enough driver at the design stage, in no particular order:

There are two memories for the seats, but you can't ask the car to set one depending upon which key you use to open the door.  (See Range Rover Mk II and III)

The XK8 trick of dropping the window glass as you open the doors allows for much tighter sealing.  While the Lexus is not bad at this (the engineering is better), it would have been better still if they'd borrowed this idea.

You can't close the roof remotely, or at least close the windows when the roof is up, as you lock the doors (again, see any Range Rover).  Even more annoyingly, although the windows work for a short time after opening the door with the key out, the auto-up function doesn't.  So if you press auto-up for the window after you've stopped and then take the key out, the window stops half-way up.

The wipers aren't as clever as either the Range Rover or the XK8 -- for example, turning the ignition off doesn't complete the cycle, and their response to changes in intermittent step isn't as logical as those cars.

The key is a bit of an old-tech joke, when compared to the standards set by Mercs and (again) Range Rover.  But it's better than the XK8.

There are lots of programmable options, but not many useful ones.  Why not have it possible to connect the stereo door to the ignition?  Otherwise you have to remember to close it to hide it from view when leaving the car.

There's no option like with Mercedes to have a baby seat disable the passenger airbag.  To be fair, my local Lexus dealer has retrofitted a solution to this, and apparently they have to change this legally either in 2004 or 2005 (I'm told), but I was surprised that they had never heard of this problem.  The local Jaguar dealer hadn't either.


Right that's enough moaning for the moment.  You've probably surmised by now that there isn't a fat lot wrong with the car.  A minor bit of reprogramming the computers would fix almost everything that annoys me about the car.  I hope they do some of these soon.

But I certainly don't regret getting one almost two years ago.  

Convertibles that I've owned for a significant time (more than one year as primary car) include the XJS, XK8, SLK, Saab, Ferrari, and MX5.  Convertibles I've driven a lot include old(pre-2002) and very-old(pre-1989) model SL320 and 500's, Z3, XKR8, Caterham 7 (ahem), and a really dodgy old Aston Martin V8.

It took me a while to decide on this one, and it's certainly the best of anything I've had or seen to date.  And I'm not thinking of selling it anytime soon, which is pretty unusual for me!

The final kicker is the service, which is better than excellent.  The documented warranties and cover beat the alternatives hands-down, but the general attitude of Lexus dealers is far and away above what's documented.  Now, I may have been lucky with my particular dealer, but I've heard that others have had similar experiences.  It's streets better than buying from any Jaguar or Mercedes dealer I've ever met, and is an enormous incentive for me to buy another from the same dealer (very rare for me!).  If the car were much worse, I could nearly recommend it for the service alone.

By the way, some notes about the "Ratings" guides.  This car actually rates as follows: 
Reliability:  6  (no faults even seem possible)
Seat comfort: 4.5 (almost perfect, not as good as Aston)
Quality:      5
Roominess:    5 in front, 1 in back.  It's a 2+2, innit!

Phew!  That went on for a while.  I hope it was of some use -- leave a comment if you like and I'll update the review if I've forgotten anything.
