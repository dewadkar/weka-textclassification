            I'm a self-confessed camera moron.  I took a course in High School, years and years ago, in how to use a camera.  Something about shutter speed and f-stops and film speed and all sorts of important information that I never managed to learn.  I can frame a photo, and I can hold a camera steady, but more than that would take time to learn, and I haven't done it yet.

Sadly, I really love to take photographs.  In January of 2000, I treated myself to the Coolpix 950.  I figured that I could take photos and if they came out badly, I wouldn't waste money on printing them.  I splurged, decided to go top-of-the-line and go ahead and get every geeks wet dream, the coolpix 950.

I quickly discovered why even my photographer friends were drooling over this camera.

First, there's the 270 degree rotation of the lens.  It doesn't seem useful at first blush, but not actually having to hold the camera at odd angles to the ground and still being able to get great photos is amazing for a novice like me.  Put it on a tripod and don't fight with the tripod, just move the lens.

The image clarity is incredible - better than the scans I've done of paper photos.

The flash leads to a lot of redeye, but with the redeye reduction feature on, I've had much less trouble.  

It's compact enough to fit in my messenger bag, and therefore small enough to take with me everywhere.

For samples of what you can do with this, see my website (http://www.swerdloff.com/) where virtually every photograph was taken with the coolpix 950.

Admittedly, it eats through batteries, so I got rechargables.  I don't need to print dye-sub 8x10s, I'm just using it for photos for the web, so I get about 70-80 pictures on an 8 meg card.

While it's pricey, I suggest it for anyone who can afford it.  It's solid enough to bounce around just a little bit, and the LCD display is clear and large enough to use well.  <br><br>
