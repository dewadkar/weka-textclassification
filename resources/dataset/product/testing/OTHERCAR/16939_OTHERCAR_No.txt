            The Outback wagon is a lot of car for the money. All wheel drive and four wheel ABS along with a peppy 4 banger makes the Outback a nice ride. This car has a much more solid feel than previous Subaru wagons. The doors shut and sound solid, not tinny. Interior noise is down, and the stereo system is excellent. The ride is plush compared to an SUV, to which this car may be considered an alternative. Gas mileage is a plus compared to an average SUV. AWD aspects of the car are impressive, and I have driven in deep sand with excellent control.
On the negative side, this is no sportscar, while the 4 cyl engine is peppy, it is not quick. In rapid acceleration the rpms go through the roof and the car is barely moving. Body roll is sometimes scary. The second cup holder is just silly. Moderately quick turns can cause wheel squeel and once again the body roll is uncomfortable. Why don't the daytime running lights also light the rear lights?
I bought this car over the Nissan Xterra, primarily due to the improved gas mileage. I cheaped out and didn't get leather interior. You should!<br><br>
