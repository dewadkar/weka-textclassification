            Overall, this camera is great.  The biggest selling factor of this camera is the size.  It is roughly the size of a large pack of gum.  You can drop it in your pocket and not even know it's there.  I needed a camera that I could just take out to parties, get togethers, and small outings, and the extreme portability of this camera allows this.  People love the size of this camera.  I took it out today in the city of San Francisco and I was stopped by a few people asking about it. 

The picture quality is okay.  It is only 2 megapixel, but that's often enough.  I shoot at 640x480 resolution which will give me about 70 shots per 8MB Memory Stick (included with purchase).  I can shoot about 12-15 shots on the same Memory Stick that will produce a nice 4x6 picture.  I don't understand why they even ship it with an 8MB stick.  I went ahead and bought a Lexar 128MB Memory stick on Amazon for about $50.  Supposedly larger Memory sticks increase lag, but I won't find out for another couple of days.  I'm not too worried about lag

The writing time onto the Memory Stick is great.  You can pretty much take picture after picture after picture.

Price isn't too bad.  I bought it at GoodGuys.com which had this unit at $243 with no tax and s/h included.  They had a 10% online coupon.  It is a little more expensive than similar digi-cams that have the same features.

There is no zoom.  Don't expect to go to a football game and take pictures of the sweat rolling down the player's face.  Rather, you'll probably take a picture of the whole formation.  This lack of a feature can be a problem.  If you plan to make this your main digi-cam, then it may not fit your needs.  I may suggest that you have another digi-cam that has all the bells and whistles, including zoom.

It has the typical Sony picture enhancements - b/w, sephia, solar, negative.  I don't care too much for these so it wasn't a selling factor.

Surprisingly, you have some freedom is controlling the shot.  You can adjust focus from auto to manual.  You have some backlight control.  You also have some shutter control.  Once again, this camera is fairly simple.  The adjustments that you can make aren't the best, but it's better than nothing.

The screen is really small, and often times you might not know if you took a good picture until you look at it on the computer.

It comes with 2 NiMH AAA batteries.  The charger takes 13 hours for a complete charge.  I went to Radio Shack and bought an extra set of batteries and quick 1 hr charger.  This is an inexpensive investment that will probably pay dividends in the future.  You can also use 2 AAA alkaline batteries.  It is not recommended, but it works.  Supposedly it affects the voltage.  Use at your own risk.

It comes with some viewing/loading software.  I don't use it b/c I use Adobe Photoshop.

Lastly, if you buy this unit overseas, you can get a hold of a blue or black edition which look really cool.
