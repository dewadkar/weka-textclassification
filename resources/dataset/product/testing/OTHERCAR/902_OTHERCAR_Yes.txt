            For three months I shopped the net, magazines and dealers for a new car. It had to be fun to drive, have a good dealer network, have a history of, or chance at, low maintenance and be a wolf in sheep's clothing (it was replacing an SHO). Finally, I drove the Audi A6, BMW 528 and 740iL (used) and Taurus SHO. The SHO is a great car for the money, but it is being discontinued. The 740iL is gorgeous, but the short block has a maintenance history that is troubling. The 528 is a superb example of BMW at its best with a full sized, four door sedan. It is more fun to drive than the LS, but is it worth $10,000 more? My answer was no.

The Lincoln LS, with all the goodies (V8, automatic w/Selectshift, AdvaceTrac, leather, premium sound, etc.), is definitely competition for the BMW 528 ! It is FUN to drive with excellent acceleration and handling. The Lincoln dealers are going out of their way to lure baby boomers to this new car (it's not the Lincoln your father used to or currently drives). While their is no maintenance history on this car, my salesman who used to be a Service Advisor, and my current Service Advisor, independently say this car should be maintenance free.

So what's wrong with the car? As Lincoln reviews point out, there is not enough storage space and the CD changer in the glove box makes this worse. The cup holders only hold 12oz cans or those weird shaped fast food cups with the narrow bottoms. And, I'm going to have to wash the mean looking, black, body more than usual. I don't know about you but I can live with that for a fast, smooth and comfortable luxury, four door sedan that can be delivered for $35-38,000 !!   <br><br>
