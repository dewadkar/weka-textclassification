            I had researched this vehicle for about a year before I finally had a chance to see it.  At the GM Test Track, there it was.  After so long, I saw the beautiful Buick Rendezvous.  I couldn't wait to test drive it!
From the outside, the vehicle looks very stylish.  It also looks easy to handle and rather small.  The surprise comes when you step in.  It's very spacious, especially for a car so small on the outside.  Perfect for my taste!
The low step-in height is great, because older people and children can get in and out with ease.  However, when you get behind the steering wheel, you still have a commanding view of the road.  Even though the engine is not extremely powerful, the Rendezvous is unusually responsive for a car of its size and capability.  
The ride is smooth and quiet, and the seats comfortable.  I love the center console, because, true to its claim, it could swallow a whole purse - mine.  And I have no dainty purse.  I could also see that it could fit a laptop.  
The handling of the Rendezvous is amazing.  It has a decent acceleration, and good brakes.
I'm not too crazy about the interior styling, but it sure is very comfortable, and best of all, quiet.  What bugs me is the use of more classy materials inside, as opposed to all plastic.  However, that is a personal choice.  Buttons, ergonomics, make sense.
I hope this vehicle does great.. I'm planning to buy one in the next few years!
