            Everytime I step out of the Mercedes C-280, I am always overwhelmed by a sense of awe and wonder that I cannot completely comprehend. Time and time again I would find myself thinking spontaneously: Wow. This is a great car. And quite frankly, it is.

As a regular <i>passenger</i> of the C-280, I cannot really give a detailed account of its driving experience, but judging from the satisfied look of everyone I've seen driving this, I am pretty sure it is a pleasant one. Great steering and turning is one comment that usually springs up, as well as the flat out safe and worry-less driving you would expect from Mercedes. I still cannot however give a comprehensive assessment of the sport shift in the Sport model which we have since I've never tried it. So perhaps in a future review, I will update this. (Sorry!) 

I particularly like the keyless entry feature of the C-280. You just push that infra-red sensor in the &quot;key&quot; slot and start the car. Like our previous Mercedes, this one has climate control and a simply laid out dashboard with easy to use buttons and switches. Unlike the previous model, this one actually has a glove compartment. The armrest also has double compartments to put your knick-knacks in. The car has a complete set of front, passenger and side airbags, which really makes me &quot;feel&quot; safer. And although the car itself is shorter than the old model, it actually has more room in the cabin. Our model comes with nice comfy seats which we have had a conscious effort to keep clean since we got this.

Overall, the C-280 is a great ride and should seriously be considered if you are looking into getting an entry-level Mercedes. Look into the Sport model for added features. My family loves it! <br><br>
