            I bought my Tracker brand new, it was the show room model.  I have since added new speakers and a CD player (mine came only with electronic tuning).  First off let me say that I live in Rochester, MI where I have to battle all seasons of the year (especially) winter.  This car has held up very well and I have been very pleased with it for many years.  The handling, appearance, (sometimes) even the acceleration is good (I drive a manual) so I can rev it up in third gear and really GO in order to pass and speed up on the highway.  Given enough room I can easily get up to 70 mph on a highway on-ramp, which is very convenient when you need the speed.  
I have recently began to really take care of this vehicle (i.e. washing it once a week, detailing inside and out), and I even waxed and polished it about a half dozen times this past spring and summer.  After beginning this " car care " phase I realized how great this vehicle looks after you have finished washing, cleaning and detailing it.  Most of the time during the summer I think my car looks better (purely on exterior appearance and cleanliness) than most brand new vehicles (sometimes better looking than sport cars like a camero!)
Recently, however, I have been having troubles with this vehicle, I have done all the scheduled maintenance including the 35,000 mile, and 55,000 mile maintenance.  And I will say I did get into a small fender bender a couple years ago which really screwed up my front axle, and front grill totaling around 3000 in repairs (but most of the cost was the body work (repainting and such)).   Aside from my accident my car has been handling very poorly during this winter season in Feb. of 2003.  Up until this winter season I  had been VERY satisfied with the handling of this vehicle during the winter months.  But now this car is being very tempermental (possibly due to the cold weather and not warming it up properly all the time).  But today for instance I park my car in a covered spot at my apt complex.  I  put it into 4-low to ensure that I would get out easily and safely and NOT hit the covered parking pole that holds up the roof.  Well....that was " nearly " not the case my car was turning sideways even in 4-low!! my rear fender came less than an inch away from hitting this darn pole! Luckily I did manage to avoid contact with it.  
I have also had problems driving around town during the winter months this year....for some reason it just seems to be " dieing " on me for some reason (even though I have been maintaining it.  Just as a reminder most all of my negative comments have been during the winter months, and these problems have only occured within the past 8 months.  My car is now 6 years old I drove it most of high school and am now in my 4th year of college.
My tracker was initially a convertible 2-door model, with a manual with 4WD.  Before I went to college I bought a conversion top (which is a hard plastic replacement top) that was about 900 bucks.  The conversion top provides extra security, tinted windows, and a rear defogger.  It is still very noisy on the highway and I still get " knocked around " on the highway with high winds.

UPDATE: 2/11/03
I found out that the reason my handling was acting oddly and unusual was due to my emergency brake being froze on my rear wheel drums.  Forcing my car to fish tail with minimal effort.  I fixed that and now it's running just as it did.  Word of advice, I bought 4 new tires for my car this past summer.  After my experience this winter I would highly recommend researching different types of tires, and to not just go with the most convenient ones.  I have poorer handling b/c of the tires I chose.  The tires are Firestone with a 55,000 mileage limit on them.  Sorry for not having the other specs of the tires.
