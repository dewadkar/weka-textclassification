            Your family will love the Regal for its large space and storage room. Its legroom can hold your whole family, the kid's soccer team, or you and a group of your friends. The Regal does a good job of being a safe car, since it is pretty solid and will protect you if you get in a smash. It has good versatility since it is very useful for a lot of things. However, you know Buicks, and it is sort of cumbersome. If you live in a dense urban area, you will have trouble with it that you would not have in a suburb. You will want a Regal if you have a family and live in the suburbs and it will be very valuable to you, but if you are not this kind of person, look for another car.
