            For the average person, this might be too costly.  The cost is accompanied though with extreme power and strength.  Think of it, you'll never have to worry about getting stuck in some mud, dirt, ice, etc.  Ofcourse you can say its too bulky and high maintainance.  But you could say that about some people too.  The maintainance is there for any car.  The impression I got was, invest in this car, and it'll take you where you want to go.  Also, for the money I paid for the Hummer, it isn't too bad considering it can handle rough terrain, bad weather and extreme temperatures.  I only went to the shop a couple times last year.  That is the same with any other car anyways.  Overall, it is a fine piece of military innovation and perfect for offroad activities.<br><br>
