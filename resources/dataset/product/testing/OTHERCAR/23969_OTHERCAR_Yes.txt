            Volkswagen set out to make the Corrado it's image vehicle for the early- to mid-nineties.  At that point, Volkswagen was floundering in the U.S., due to a lack-luster model range and a tarnished build-quality image brought over from the eighties.  The Corrado, developed as a successor to the Scirocco, was to be VW's last true sports car.  In mid-1992, the VR6 engine was introduced, replacing the quick but problematic supercharged four-pot engine.  The VR6 is a narrow-angle (15 Deg) V-6 engine with a shared cylinder head.  It produced 178 horsepower and brought power and reliability to VW's most unique model.

I purchased this vehicle recently, after lusting after Corrados for years.  It is riot to drive, handles superbly (easily one of the best-handling front-wheel-drive cars ever), and has proven quite reliable.  The interior truly encompasses the sport luxury coupe concept proclaimed by its SLC designation.  The exterior styling is just as fresh as the day it was produced.  I still get asked if my Corrado is the latest BMW or Audi sport car.

This car is perfect for single people or couples.  I wouldn't recommend it for families, as the back seat is usable but quite small.  For such a tiny car, it does have a remarkable amount of room.  It was not built with airbags (driver's side airbags became a requirement in 1995, the Corrado was cancelled after 1994 in the U.S.), but is still performed quite well in crash tests.  Build quality is very good, although not quite up to the level of excellence that VW has attained in recent years.

Overall, this is a terrific car.  It is difficult to find, as only several thousand were sold each year during its five year run in the U.S.  However, low-mileage, mint cars can be found.  Expect to spend above blue book for a well-maintained car, as these VW's are very hard for their owners to part with.<br><br>
