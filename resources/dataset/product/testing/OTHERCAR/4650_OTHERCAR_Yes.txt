               I love my chevy cavalier.  She is the best car I have ever owned.  She is dependable and reliable.  I have put over 14,000 in one year and she has taken it beautifully.  I haven't needed any major repairs and I baby her when ever I can.
   I own a 2 door and have a fold down back seat, which allows me to pack more on trips!  I have had 5 friends in this car comfortably.  I have also had it parked into some rather tight spots. She handles wonderfully and the anti-lock brakes makes this car perfect. 
     The only complaint with my car is that I didn't get many options.  I don't have power anything, but I have a cd player and that's more important anyway!!  The only other thing that i find wrong with the car is that the doors swing out kinda wide, but I can live with that.
   She is sporty and luxurious, compact and roomy and she has all the attitude needed to run in this big truck and sporty car world.<br><br>
