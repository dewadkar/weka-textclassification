            Owning an older (85') model ... I was very dubious of buying another. Yet after going to the local Chevrolet dealership ... I fell in love with one. Buying it was the best thing that I have ever done! It was glossy black and beautiful! Options include: Ext. cab, Sport Side, Third door (which I DO NOT recommend), cd &amp; tape, etc. etc. etc.

The only real problem that I have had with it was a fairly large amount of irritating noise from inside the cab. More grunts and noises than ... well... well, you get the point! Every-single-time that I have taken it in to get the problem resolved ... my local Rip-Off dealer (Smith Chevrolet in Ft. Smith, Ar.) always says that they can't 'duplicate' the problem. Oh well ... the other, smaller local dealership needs my business more anyway! But for the record ... most of the noises come from that accursed third door. Certainly a 'don't do' in the 'Buying a sweet truck, for dummies' manual.

My truck has the 6-cyl eng. and while not the most gas preserving vehicle I have ever owned, it is very high on the chart in regards to power. Driving this wonderful truck has always been a pleasure and my automatic transmission shifts smoother than I ever could! I recommend this truck to EVERYONE! For the younger generation for its stylish looks and awe-inspiring power ... and for us 'older (and much more wise)' generation because of its stylish looks, reliability, and because its the best small sized truck (I.M.H.O.)on the market!    Enjoy!<br><br>
