            After looking at cars for over 1 year, I finally did it, I bought a Kia Sportage.  I had stopped at our local dealer, probally 15 times, sometimes just looking and once in a while taking a test drive.  I knew that this is the car I wanted but, I could not commit myself to car payments.  Well, in August I stopped in and there she was, grey with purple stripes, just calling my name.  And I was hooked.  Small and compact, 4 door, 4 wheel drive, she was not new, a 1996 with only 25,000 miles on her. Kia's come with a excellent warranty.   Unblemished, she looked new to me.  Took her for a test drive and I had to have her.  

Kia's are good for 2 adults and maybe a couple of children.  Not a car you would buy if you have a large family.  It is very good on gas and handles the road well.  Like any other SUV it is top heavy and compact so you must control your speed on curves and turns but otherwise it drives well.  

We had snow and ice last night, so I had to use the 4wheel drive for the first time and she handled it very well.  So far I have had no trouble with the car at all.

Go and test drive one for yourself and you will be sold on it.
