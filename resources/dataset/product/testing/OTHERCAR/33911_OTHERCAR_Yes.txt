            This is my first auto review so bare with me as cars are not really my thing.  As long as it has gas in it, gets me where I want to go and looks decent, has always been my philosophy on automobiles.

We had the chance to take a 2001 Toyota Highlander from Independence, Kansas to Daytona Beach, Florida.  This is approximately 1400 miles.  I do not own this car but after that many miles I feel like I can give at least a decent review on this automobile.

The ride in this SUV was very smooth and sitting in this automobile for 1400 miles was comfortable.  I never felt the need to pull over so I could stretch, nor was I squirming to change positions in the seat.  To me the ride in the Highlander is smoother than Toyota's Rav 4 but not as smooth as Toyota's Sienna Van.  But for a SUV this ride is very comfortable.

The 2001 Toyota Highlander we drove to Florida had a V6 3.0 L engine 4 speed automatic.

Standard features of this vehicle are:
Full time 4 wheel drive
4 wheel independent suspension
Front and rear stabilizer bars
4 wheel power assisted disc brakes
P225/70R16 radial tires
16 x 6.5 styled steel wheel safety
Driver-passenger air bags
Side door impact beams
Rear intermittent wipers
auto-off halogen head lamps
Multi-reflector tail lamps

I like the feature that Toyota has with the headlights coming on when the engine is started.  I do not own a Toyota, although I have and this is the reason for me having the automatic headlights installed in my mini van, I got use to that feature when I owned a Toyota.  This, to me is a great safety feature.  It is really comforting to know that a lot of states now have laws where if you are using your wipers you headlights must also be on.

In Florida we ran into some fog in several places.  There were lots of automobiles out on the road without their headlights on and were awfully hard to see, especially lighter color cars.  Driving the Highlander with the automatic lights made me feel a lot safer on the road. Especially so since the Highlander was Millennium Silver in color.

These features are added to the Highlander for your comfort and convenience:
Multi-adjustable front captians chairs
60/40 split folding rear seats with fold flat and recline features
Adjustable head rest on all seats
2 auxiliary power outlets
6 cup holders
Sculpted door panels with pockets
4 grocery bag hooks in the back
cruise control
overhead storage for sunglasses
front passenger lights
digital clock
Deluxe exterior cassette/cd with 6 speakers
Power windows and door locks
CFC free air conditioning
Tilt steering
Dual console

I really liked the way the console was fitted into the dash.  There was plenty of room for moving into the back of the vehicle without having to be a gymnast and having to contort your body to get over center consoles.  The console in the Highlander is fitted right under the area where the radio, cd and cassette, air conditioner and heater controls are located and does not go clear to the floor.  If you had small children buckled in the second seat you could go back there to attend them without getting out of the vehicle.  We had our luggage at the very back of the vehicle and I wanted something out of the luggage.  It was very easy for me to leave the front passenger seat and go to the second seat and reach over the back and get to the luggage.  With those center consoles it is a chore to try and crawl over them. Of course, it is not advisable to be crawling into the back of a moving vehicle but if you have young children there are times when it is necessary to get back to them and with the console as it is in the Highlander this would be very easy to do.

I also like this feature with the console because, as a woman I carry a purse most places and the purse can fit between the front seats when there is not a center console.

I drove about half the time that we were taking the Highlander to Florida and one thing I did notice was that when engaging the brake it seemed to have a lot smoother braking then some other cars that I have driven

The limited warranty on this vehicle is:
36 months or 36,000 miles comprehensive coverage
5 year or 60,000 miles powertrain coverage
5 year body panel corrosion perforation warranty

The Highlander we drove had as an add on feature a luggage cover.  This is nice in that once you have the back end loaded with luggage or other items, you can pull the cover over and it hides the fact that you are loaded with stuff and may be a determent to would be thieves.  The cover is attached to the top part of the back of the second seat and extends about 8-10 inches from the seat.  I think this is a nice little feature but at the cost of $810.00 I probably wouldn't get it added on if I owned the vehicle.

The window sticker said that the average gas mileage was 18 city and 22 highway.  We found that 20 mpg was the best we could get.  I was driving when we were going through Texas where the speed limit was 75.  I set the cruise at around 79 (yes, I am one of those!!!) and did notice that the mpg was never over 19 at that speed.  Hubby was driving when speed limits were 65 and at that time we did notice that mpg was 20  and once in awhile it would register at 21 mpg but that was not very often.

We found that the Highlander had plenty of power for a V6 and was pretty snappy when passing another vehicle.

The one thing we did have a dislike for, was the driver and front passenger cup holders.  They are located on the side base of the driver seat.  Your cup/bottle sits pretty much on the floor.  It is very awkward to get a cup in and out of the holder.  Not that it didn't fit, but that with a stryo cup with lid, you had a tendency to pull the lid off while trying to get it into the holder.  I think this was because  you had to get hold of the cup around the top and in so doing the cup lost some of its shape because you have a tendency to slightly squeeze the cup and that in turn caused the lid to want to come off.  Also, with the cup holder being right against the seat base that also made it awkward to put the cup into the holder.  I think the better place would have been at the base of the console.  However, the ashtray was located at the base of the console.  I just think they need to rethink the position of the front cup holders.  I did not pay attention as to where the back seat cup holders were located.

This was a fun ride for 1400 miles, I will not be purchasing a Toyota Highlander because I just don't feel the need to spend $30,000 + on a vehicle.  With add ons the sticker price on this particular Highlander was a little over $35,000.00

This SUV looks pretty classy!
