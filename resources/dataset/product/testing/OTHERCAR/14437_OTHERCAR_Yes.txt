            I have decided to edit this opinion a little.  I like my car so much that I decided to give it more props and offer more info.  So here goes....

I love this car!  I own a 1996 camry and it is the best car I have ever had!  I bought it used almost 2 years ago and have not had any problems with it.  I do a lot of transporting for my job which includes transporting adults and children and it is well suited for the task.  All of my passengers seem to have plenty of room and car seats are not difficult to get in and out. The trunk is also big enough for storing bags, clothes, books,and just about anything else.

I have put over 70,000 miles on the car since I bought it, so of course I am over 100,000 miles and it is still purring like a kitten.

I think this is a perfect car for most people, it is decently priced....new or used.  There is plenty of room, and the ride is wonderful.  This car is especially good for those who have to spend a lot of time in the car.

My camry came complete with a stylish wing, cruise, power locks and windows which included a nifty little feature called child protector.  This enables you to control the doors and windows from the drivers side ONLY!  Some other extras worth mentioning are the moonroof, the manual transmission &quot;power&quot; button which increases acceleration, an the fold down rear seats.  The fold down rear seat option gives you instant access to anything in the trunk. 

Another plus for this car is that it gets excellent gas mileage on the interstate or in high traffic areas.<br><br>
