            I have now owned my Kia for six months.  I have just over 10,000 miles on it.  It has taken me from Michigan to South Carolina and all points in between.

The seats are very comfortable for long rides.  My lower back does not ache after a long day of driving.  And my legs are not &quot;cut off&quot; with the seat cushion pinching in the back of my thighs.

It takes the rough spots in the road nicely and handles the West Virginia curves smoothly.  The only drawback of mountain driving is the steep up grades.  My Kia held the speed, but would have to engage in the next gear quite often to maintain the speed going up the mountains.  The engine whined until the road leveled out.  The gas mileage improves as it is driven more.  With the gas prices today, I'm very happy we traded in our Ford F150 for this vehicle.  

As for the physical lay out of the dash board, the only draw backs are that the cup holder, when pulled out, hides the rear window defrost button and the steering wheel hides the rear window wiper button.  You have to take your eyes off the road to look for those two buttons.

This Kia still provides you with the hauling capabilities of a truck.  With the back seat folded down, I was able to buy and brand new clothes dryer and bring it home that day.  I didn't have to wait for it to be delivered.    <br><br>
