            My mother purchased a 1997 Monte Carlo Z34 new, and our entire family was very excited, but that excitement waned over the past 3 years to become an eventual frustration.  

The car was very attractive, and came with every option including motorized leather seats, a power sunroof and spoiler, I mean the car had every option you could get.  It ran smooth and the price was good--roughly about $22,000.  It had plenty of power from the 215HP 3.4 liter V6, and everything was fine for about the first 10K miles or so...and then things began to happen.  The check engine light would come on when it appeared nothing was wrong, as well as the low oil light.  After taking it to the dealer it was found out that nothing was wrong indeed.  These were small things and were shrugged off.  Then one day the car started very roughly, and smoke poured out of the exhaust while the car shook bad.  It was taken to the dealer and it was found out that the spark plug wires on half the car were bad, so they replaced just those on that half since it was still under warranty.  This should have never happened to a car that is supposed to go 100K before its first tune up, but it did, and they didn't even give it a full tune up and change all the plug wires, just 3.

The car then ran good for awhile, but eventually the same aforementioned problems with the warning lights would keep coming on, sometimes the headlights, which are supposed to be daytime running lights, would not come on, and more problems.  My mother decided that she wanted to purchase the extended warranty because of the amount of problems that we were having with the car before it reached 36K miles, at which time warranty renewal is not allowed.  She called many times to attempt to renew it but was always put on hold and given the run-around.  She ended up going over the 36K because she had to drive the car to get to work, so she had no choice.  

While many more small problems continued to occur, my mother simply had to deal with them since it was out of her own pocket.  The rotors on all 4 wheels went bad and we had to pay about $600 to replace them, and the mechanic said that they were faulty and would have been covered by the warranty.  Later around 50K miles the car had the same smoke and shake problem that it had before.  We took it into the dealership and they said that it was the other 3 plug wires on the other side, and they had to replace them.  Changing a plug wire isn't as easy as it used to be, and the cost of repairs amounted to another $500!  

Several months after this my mother received a notification in the mail saying that all Monte Carlos were recalled due to faulty spark plug wires.  My mother had to hassle for another 6 months before the dealership would refund her money that she paid to have these replaced.  When the check finally arrived it was for $116.  They said that there were other repairs made besides the spark plug wires, however, these repairs were needed because the car malfunctioned due to the plug wires.  

To make a long story short my mother has still not received all of her money and is very dissapointed with the cars reliability.  Although she definitely enjoys the car when it runs well, since it is very comfortable and rides very smooth.  However the hassle of maintaining it is just unbearable and extremely costly.  <br><br>
