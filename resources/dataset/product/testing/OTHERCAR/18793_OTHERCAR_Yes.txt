            When Jeep fathered the family-SUV category in the early 80's no one would have guessed what would become of this market.  Over the past few years, Chrysler has directed its Jeep marque to a higher level of performance and reliability than it ever experienced in past times.  This vehicle was purchased for use as daily transportation, and it has served me and my family well in this capacity.  The Cherokee excels at most tasks, and while it is a truck, its handling and body control are very positive and are far beyond the industry standard.

The most appealing aspects of this vehicle, to me, are its performance and usefulness.  This truck is a performer in all areas, it has acceleration far better than its competitors, and braking/handling are equally impressive.  The 4.0 Litre straight-six is the segment benchmark for reliability, and power, and it has become far smoother due to recent refinements.  The cockpit controls are all easy to use and have been problem free for the duration of ownership.

The primary competitors in this market are the Ford Explorer, Chevy Blazer, Toyota 4Runner, and Nissan Pathfinder (and the Grand Cherokee).  The Ford and Chevy will both send you to the chiropractor after a ten-minute ride and they are both agonizingly slow and ponderous.  The Ford does hold the edge in interior appointments and spaciousness though.  The Japanese models are good trucks but, the Nissan only upgrades the interior and they are both hideously expensive to buy and to service.

I have operated this vehicle in inclement conditions ranging from midwestern blizzards to a deluge in the Ozarks.  The 4wd is excellent and power delivery can be easily modulated.  Through a half-dozen trips to the mountains in Colorado, the Jeep has remained powerful and confident in the higher altitudes. 

This truck is enjoyable to drive and to own, and for the price, it cannot be matched.  It is perfect for anyone in need of rugged, reliable transportation, and respectable fuel economy (well above the segment average)

The only people who should avoid a Cherokee in their vehicle search are those who routinely haul more than 4 people, or those who desire more cavernous cargo accommodations.<br><br>
