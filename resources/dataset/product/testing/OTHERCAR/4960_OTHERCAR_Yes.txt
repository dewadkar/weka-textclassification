            I have owned this camera now for approximately one month.  I ordered it from Newegg.com if you care to read that review.  I have now spent the last month, working to get acquainted with this camera before I will go to Berlin in two weeks time.  I had originally wanted the Coolpix 5700, mostly because of the 8X optical zoom and 5 megapixel resolution.  I had decided that the extra $300 or more I could pay for that camera might not be worth it, if I could get a good camera also from Nikon, with only one less megapixel.

I have not been disappointed with this choice.  I do not miss the 1 megapixel, but I would prefer the 8X zoom lens.  Keep in mind when you purchase a digital camera there are two types of zoom that are being referred to.  One being optical zoom and the other is digital zoom.  Both of these are important.  Be careful when you see something that says 'effective' zoom as typically that might be a warning that you are not going to have much flexibility in your photography.

And of course, another important factor is the megapixel.  Here you will often see actual megapixel and effective megapixel.  Be sure to closely read these details.

If you are buying a digital camera, it must be assumed that you are taking photos for your own personal enjoyment or whether you need the camera simply for convenience at work.  If you are buying the camera for your own use, then it would be important that you are buying a quality photographic device, capable of rendering high quality photos that you can enjoy for many years.  If you are using one of these at work, perhaps you use it for quality control, or accident reports or whatever, and the absolute highest quality and resolution are not quite so important.

As to the Coolpix 4300, you are getting a high quality camera and at a fair price, or at least I got mine at a good price.  

As for ease of use, you can take this camera out of the box, charge the battery and begin taking photos almost immediately.  It utilizes the very common compact flash storage cards, which are so readily available that I have seen them right beside normal 35mm film in the aisle at a local Target store.

But, you can set the camera on Auto Mode and more or less point and shoot and get up and running with it right away.  Alternately you can set it on the Scenes Mode and also use it without educating yourself.  On the Auto Mode, there is not much you will choose, other than having previously setting the image size and picture quality while in the Setup Mode.  In the Scene Mode, you will use the menu button to choose the most applicable Mode for the type of photo you wish to take.

After this, you will need to have prior knowledge or refer to the manual quite a bit, to use the camera in Manual Mode, where you have full choice of the aperture and exposure time.  You also have a choice at effective film speed.

The camera is quite flexible and having only 4 instead of 5 megapixels has not been of any significance.  

The instruction guide that comes along with the camera is thick and informative and will help as you learn your way around this sophisticated but easy to learn camera.  

The first day of using the on screen menu at the rear of the camera was a nuisance, but as soon as you get the hang of it, it's really rather natural.  

Another wonderful thing about this camera is that it is so small you can almost put it in a pocket.  It's only because of its bulk that this is not possible.  But it will easily fit into a waist-pack or a small woman's purse with no problem.  That is a big plus for me when I travel, as I don't care to lug a bulky camera bag all over the place.

As to whether I'll recommend this camera to other prospective buyers, I'll say yes.  If you are new to digital photography or need a good camera to take on a vacation or to send your college student to college with, it is excellent.

I am going to use it as a learning tool and this time next year, I will likely upgrade to the 5700 as I would really prefer the zoom.

But you cannot debate the quality of Nikon.  The quality of build and their optics are fantastic.

I would recommend this camera.
