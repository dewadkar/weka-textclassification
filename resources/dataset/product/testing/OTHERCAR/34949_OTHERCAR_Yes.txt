            The Grand Prix SE was a just car I rented for a 800 mile business trip. I have been disappointed with my previous experiences with GM sedans (1990 Oldsmobile Touring Sedan and 1998 Chevy Malibu). The Grand Prix was a pleasant surprise.

EXTERIOR: 7
I've always liked Pontiac's designs with a few exceptions. The Grand Prix will not attract many second looks---good or bad.

INTERIOR: 8
Being a road warrior for most of my career, I value a comfortable driver's seat above all else. At first, the seats seem too firm and thin for long freeway cruising. It is situated rather low to the floor of the car. But after my 800 mile stint---no aches or pains! The velour-like cloth seats and soft-textured plastics on the dash were a nice touch. The trunk lid uses gas-charged shocks instead of hinges for support to avoid intrusion into the cargo space. The curvy shape of the opening and high lift-over is not ideal for large boxes.

ENGINE:
The 3100 V6 in the Grand Prix SE is just adequate for a vehicle this size.

RIDE &amp; HANDLING:
The ride was firm and you can definitely feel the tires on the pavement. There was quite a bit of wind noise as well. There seems to be a bit of under-steer that made the car feel heavier than it really is.

THE VERDICT:
A good all around comfortable vehicle. <br><br>
