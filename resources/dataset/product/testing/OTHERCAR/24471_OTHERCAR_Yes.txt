            The Infiniti J30 is a rare jewel.  The first time I sat in the car I was in love.  As I sat in the leather seats I felt like a Queen on her thrown.  I closed the door, and all outside noise was instantly gone.  It was just me and 'Her'.
The first thing I noticed was the wood panel dash and the 'gold' clock.  It just looked like luxury.  I turned on the Bose stereo system which was phenomenal.  The sound was better than my home system!  And I took Her for a drive, which was as smooth as the leather seats.  There was nothing this car didn't have:  Power steering, power locks, power seats, power windows, moonroof, integrated sound system, Bose CD/Cassette and speakers, all leather interior, lumbar support, alloy wheels, cruise control, A/C...it had EVERYTHING.  That first ride lasted 2-1/2 hours.  I didn't ever want to stop.  It was extremely smooth with no outside noise distractions.

In the past 3 years I have had 3 back surgeries, and I have had to drive back and forth from my doctors office (which is 3 hours away from my home).  With the comfort of the Infiniti, I had no problems with this drive.  

I bought this car used, with 50,000 miles.  With all of the drives to and from the doctor I easily hit 100,000 miles with no problems.

And then it happened....like a nightmare....I was on my way to the doctor, and out of nowhere a truck plows into me.  So I can tell you that both the driver and passenger airbags deploy flawlessly.  The front end of the car was completely totaled, but I literally walked away with only bruises (and a broken heart).

The car was so damaged that it was not repairable.  However, I believe that 'She' saved my life.  Where I was sitting, in the drivers seat, was unharmed.  When I had to go by and see Her after the accident - I cried.  It was only then that I realized how much I really did love the car.  I have looked into what car to get - and there is nothing that would compare.  So, I am forced to find another Black Infiniti J30!
