            I bought a '93 Pathfinder &amp; I still have it.  I got it because I wanted a roomy &quot;Ute&quot;.  With the Pathfinder I got just that.  What I mean by roomy is head &amp; shoulder room.  It does not pack a big payload.  It's adequate probably for most situations, however.  I, also, got reliabilty.  What I did not get was much &quot;punch under the hood.&quot;  Some passing situations have been &quot;fun.&quot;  I do recommend getting the higher end models.  I did that &amp; was not sorry.

Over all I recommend the car, understanding the drawbacks mentioned.  I've logged 130,000+ miles without a hitch, other than routine maintenance.
