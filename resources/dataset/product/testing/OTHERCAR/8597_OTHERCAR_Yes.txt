            2002 is the final model year for the Volkswagen Cabrio as it is now out of production.  Thankfully, I found someone who just traded his in for a new convertible Beetle.  It only had 3,700 miles and there is no other option available on this car!!!  Just too sweet!  I still have my 1993 VW Cabriolet and I love that car too.  But to say the two cars are the same is totally out of the question.  The Cabrio has supple leather, heated seats and they are just so comfortable!  The dash board is electric blue with violet red indicators and it is just awesome at night!!  The top on the GLX is power and goes up and down with ease.  It has front and side air bags and just so many little features which make an excellent choice in a convertible.  It is a cult classic and either you love it or you hate it and I just love all of my VWs.  The warranty is 4/50,000 and fully transferable to any owner.  So even though I am the second owner on my car, I recevied the full warranty until March of 2006 including roadside assistance.  Quite a deal!

You can still find some 2002 untitled Cabrios if you search around and I completely recommend this car.  Smaller than the Sebring, but that means it handles that much better and you can zip around town or cruise down the highway and the car just rides that well.  Plus it is a preppie little number which will never go out of style.  People always stop me with my Cabriolet and tell me they just love that  car.  From the Rabbit, Cabriolet, Cabrio and now the Beetle, Volkswagen just knows how to produce an legendary convertible.  And you won't see yourself coming and going  because the cars aren't very numerous.      

Locking storage compartments and such also make it very practical so you can leave the top down when running errands.  The CD changer sits in the trunk safe from snoopers and the sun as well.  With the top down and the boot on, it is just a very clean look and the car just couldn't be more distinctive.    

Granted the engine is a little slow but I am not one for speed.  Although, the new generation Cabrio is much peppier than the Cabriolets.  For me it is just a very smooth, quiet well-equipped car which I love to get into every day and just drive.  Awesome 8 speaker sound system makes every journey that much more enjoyable.  

Reliablitiy with my VWs has always been awesome although I know some people have had some problems.  This is my 4th VW and my 3rd VW convertible and they have all been very reliable with no major repairs necessary whatsover.  

If you are in the market for a very practical, safe, but oh so fun to drive convertible, the VW Cabrio is your only choice.  Spend the extra cash for the leather seats and even for the power top if you can.  Test drive it first just to see how much fun it is.  The Cabrio is not for everyone, but once you test drive, I think you will be very impressed on the level of quality this car exudes.  

The new Beetle convertible is really cool and very cute but just a little too trendy for my tastes.  This Cabrio is an understated alternative to the new Beetle not to mention a little less expensive.  You just may find a bit of a challenge on your hands when trying to locate one but as I have discovered, it is definitely worth the quest.  

Good luck!  I hope you decide to become a Cabrio owner and that you love yours as much as I love mine!  Enjoy the Fahvernugen!!
