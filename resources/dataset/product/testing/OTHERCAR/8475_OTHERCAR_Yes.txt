            Abstract:

You'd be hard pressed to find a better value in the sub-$500 or sub-3megapixel market.  It's easy to use and has the best bundle of ANY camera in its range.

Features:

2.1 mega pixel CCD (up to 10x12"), 3x optical/2.5x digital zoom, USB connection, 1.8" LCD, SmartMedia storage

Design:

Encased in shiny metallic plastic, the 2600 is just slightly thicker than its A2XX cousins or Canon Elph's.  In terms of absolute size, it's wonderfully small, but Nikon's 775 is a bit more intuitive to hold because of its sculpted handle.  The 2600 is easy to hold, but you're holding it with your fingers, not your hands.  Build quality is fantastic and, unlike just about every other peer, it's made in Japan.

Bundle:

Very, very, very generous - 16MB Smart Media card, 2AA LithiumIon batteries and charger, pouch, strap, USB cable, and FinePix software.  The card and the batteries/charger are worth somewhere in the $50 range, so factor that into your pricing.

Photo Quality:

A solid A-, with Nikon's offerings being in the A/A+ range.  You just can't get a competitor to the incredible all-glass Nikkor lens in this price range...at least not yet.  For 99.99% of users, however, this is irrelevant.  It will take a trained or savvy eye to notice the ever-so-slight oversaturation in the colors or the "boldness" in the contrast.  A more-expensive Olympus or Nikon will have photos that feel more subtle, that aren't so generous in doling out the reds/greens/blues, that control whites better, etc.

The flash is a bit weak, but definitely tolerable.  The overall photo quality is perfect for most people and, honestly, probably overkill for the web or email.  The 2600 allows for more fine-tuning (things like macro mode, white balance, etc.) than even-simpler competitors from HP, Kodak, etc., but lacks the landscape controls of a Nikon.

Function:

When powered on, the lens extends out from behind a manually-opened 2-stage lens cover - make sure the lens cover is completely open or you'll get an error message.  The 1.8" LCD viewfinder is one of the best I've ever seen, clear and crisp on a bright day outside.  The menu system is more intuitive than that of an average VCR.

Battery life is actually quite long - longer than I expected.  Over Thanksgiving, we used our 2600 at 7 different gatherings, with about 10 photos at each.  Factoring in all the different previews for people and re-takes, we figure the 4 days worth of holiday festivities without recharging was quite good.

Value:

EXCELLENT.  I bought a 2600 at Microcenter during their 22% off/22nd Anniv. sale, which brought the price down to $240.  In addition, they threw in a 64MB card for a penny PLUS there was a $30 rebate.  Basically, I paid just a tick over $200, so it was an outstanding value.

Even though this camera is overkill for your average photo-emailer, it's a terrific value and worth the $275-300 price.  It has point & shoot simplicity, an unparalleled bundle, near-Nikon photo quality, and a snazzy design for a terrific price.
