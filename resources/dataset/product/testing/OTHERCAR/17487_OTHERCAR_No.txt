                 My wife wanted a minivan.  We were checking out new minivans and almost accidentally ran upon the Kia Sedona.  After trying the Caravan, Montana and a couple of others, she decided she really liked this vehicle.  It has a lot of places to put things, including map holders, extra glove boxes, extra cupholders, and even a first aid kit, and for several thousand less than a caravan she could get some of the same "options" as standard equipment.  In addition, the warranty is awesome.  But then the fun began... finding the vehicle that fit the requirements.
     We have 2 children, so 2nd row captains seats was a must, so we needed an EX.  We live in an area that could have some nasty roads on occaision, and since we have those two small children, I wanted ABS.  We also live in an area where it gets rather warm in summer, and in addition, we have a dog who happens to have claws, so we wanted cloth seats.  To cap all of this, she had a color picked out, but in this story, her Misty Blue is completely insignificant.
     After 2 months of searching, driving to dealers that promised, "Oh yeah, we have one of those on the lot," only to find out they had lied, thinking that we would negotiate or didn't REALLY know what we wanted, etc., we found a minivan that she liked that had cloth seats, ABS, and 2nd row captains chairs.  It was a Ford Windstar, not a Kia Sedona.  Kia apparently does not make this combination and it can not be ordered.  The disputed charge on my credit card from a down payment on an ordered vehicle that one dealer could not deliver is still pending.
     We finally gave in on the leather seats... we would get seat covers and put over them.  This would save us some $6000 vs the Windstar that my wife fell in love with because it had some cool options.  My wife testdrove the Sedona with the leather seats, and almost talked herself out of it since they are SOOOO uncomfortable.
     After some soul searching and budget examining, she decided to go with the Sedona anyway rather than the Windstar.  After all, the Sedona has a MUCH, MUCH longer warranty, and is much nicer on the budget.  We could get some heavy duty sheepskin seat covers, a mirror to see the kids riding in the back and an entertainment unit for the minivan for less than $300 total.
     Then an odd thing happened.  Driving the minivan home from work on the first full day that she had it, our four year old discovered that he could release the locks on his seat (not his booster, but the actual vehicle seat), and he could ride on a "roller coaster" back and forth while my wife is on the expressway driving home at 60 mph.  This is a MAJOR SAFETY FLAW!!!!!  Had she been in an accident, he likely would have been killed or maimed.
     So, my wife called the dealership and asked them to fix this problem.  She was told in a very rude manner that she would "have to teach him not to do that".  Excuse me, but the safety flaw is not my child, but the way the vehicle is made!  Now we are looking for a way to back out of the deal.  Our childrens lives are not worth the $120 a month we are saving in payments vs the Windstar.  I would personally prefer to SUE Kia for endangering my children!  If you are looking at this vehicle and you have children... DON'T DO IT!!!!!!!!!
