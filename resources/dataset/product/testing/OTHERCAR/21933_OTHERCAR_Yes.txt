            Absolutely the best car in its class, short of the 540i and the M5 of course, but then again those are in their own class by themselves :) High class automobile with the best sport precision handling and a great ride. Silky smooth engine with a lot of power and torque. Absolutely perfect cabin layout and a huge trunk. The car is gorgeous, extremely cool yet tactfully understated. The sport/premium pack makes the car - highly recommended. The only imperfections I listed in the &quot;weaknesses&quot; but since they really are just an add-on equipment I do not count them against the car itself. BMW NA on the other hand should address those issues ASAP as many people hate the sound system in particular. Furthermore, there is no easy way to upgrade it and absolutely no way to replace the head unit! 

This car is a work of art. The 528i is my second BMW, after a 1996 328is, and the leap in quality is tremendous. And the 528i is only $4k more than the E46 328i!

If you enjoy driving you will love this car. However, if you are an average american transportee who doesn't know what blinkers are for and just looking for something to get you from place to place in, look elsewhere since you will spend a lot of money and won't be able to appreciate what you have.<br><br>
