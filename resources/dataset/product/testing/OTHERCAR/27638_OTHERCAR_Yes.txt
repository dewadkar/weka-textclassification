            I got this camera on offer for abt US$100 and at first I didnt really fancy its very 'plastic' appearance, compared to our other digicam the Fuji finepix F601Z sleek smooth metal body. But I use this camera for work now bcoz its more rugged than the Finepix (not to mention cheaper so if it got damaged at least my dad won't kill me). 1.3MP is ok, can take some good shots no optical zoom but i'm not really complaining becoz i don't really need it. Its pretty easy to use, fuss free just point and shoot. Flash is strong and bright, can get quite a decent battery life. Good for beginners and casual users. The camera is also quite compact so it fits easily in a small pouch. The bundled software Zoombrowser EX is easy to use and allows for direct printing with your canon printer. They even attach the date and time the photo was taken, very useful for my work. I think the camera does very well with bright outdoor shots doesnt overcompensate but very blah with night/dark shots. Tends to have a slow lag time as well between shots. The LCD is ok, not very clear but OK. Overall this camera is CHEAP and delivers a gd enuff performance for casual users
