            After driving an Oldsmobile Silhouette mini-van for several years, it was time to trade it in and get a new car! We test drove an '01 Silhouette, but kept going back to the '01 Buick LeSabre. We didn't get some of the "bells and whistles" I was used to on my mini-van, but there are other options we are quite happy with - the Driver Information Center, for one. This is a really nice feature, to check one's range of travel on a tank of gas, to check tire pressure, oil pressure, etc. I really do miss my thermometer and compass from my van, but the compass IS available on certain LeSabre packages. The auto dimming rearview mirror is one of those "bells and whistles" I am really taken with now, and don't know how I would live without one in the future. One thing we were certain we wanted in a new car was the radio/tape/CD controls on the steering wheel. We were used to that, and feel that it is absolutely a necessary safety feature (we don't have to look down at the radio/tape player/CD player to control the volume, change stations, etc., thus endangering our lives and the lives of others on the road).

The LeSabre rides SO much smoother than the mini-van, I feel I am riding on air! It handles beautifully - almost drives itself!

We had such a favorable experience with the dealership and salesman, we will certainly look at another Buick, when the time comes to trade in this car!!
