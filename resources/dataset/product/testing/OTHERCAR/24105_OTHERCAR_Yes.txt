            Last month I purchased a 2000 LESabre Custom Sedan and must say I am very pleased with it as I write this review. The lumbar seat feature is quite comfortable and the power seat functions very well.This is the first car I have bought with a side air bag and I like the extra security of having it. This car was bought as a family vehicle and it is very roomy inside. This car drives well and takes the corners smoothly. The front seat armrest storage container is big and handy.In fact,all the accessories on this vehicle seem to be well thought out and quite functional.I would recommend the Buick LESabre 2000 to anyone in the market for a sedan and am very pleased with it and the price. A+!<br><br>
