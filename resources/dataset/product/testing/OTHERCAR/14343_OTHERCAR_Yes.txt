            Right now, I am the midst of purchasing a new car/late model used car, and the Nissan Altima is the car I am leaning toward.  In response to an epinion I have recently read, I would like to state that I believe that the 1997 Altima was the first year Nissan put out that car.  I have been looking at Altimas for some time now, and it seems that the 1997 model was sort of like the &quot;test&quot;.  All of the problems spoken about with this model have since been repaired in later models.  A salesman actually advised me not to buy the 1997 model.  

All in all, Nissan is a well respected company, and the Altima is a fine automobile for the money.  It has the comforts of the more expensive Maxima, at a fraction of the cost.

I continue to lean toward the Altima in making my own purchase, although I will consider models after 1997. <br><br>
