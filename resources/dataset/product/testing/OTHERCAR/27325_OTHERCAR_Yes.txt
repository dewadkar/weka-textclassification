            I have owned several SUV's in the past and I can tell you without hesitation that the Dodge Durango is THE BEST.  It has a great ride, comfortable seating (with plenty of it!) and an excellent sound system.  The only negative thing I can say about the Durango is it's gas mileage - but all V8 SUV's have bad gas mileage, so it's something I'm willing to overlook.  

I only have one child, but when we go somewhere we have to take everything but the kitchen sink!  This is a great vehicle for families with one to 6 kids.  The 3rd seat bench is truly a great feature for this size vehicle.

The Durango truly is a great vehicle with fantastic options, I highly recommend it!<br><br>
