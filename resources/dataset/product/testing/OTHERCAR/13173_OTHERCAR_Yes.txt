            The Mazda Millenia S was on my short list of autos when I looked at purchasing a new 4-door sedan this past year. I eventually purchased a 2002 Nissan Maxima SE (review posted) and I am sure you can tell by the car I ended up with what some of my basic criteria were: 

-4 doors...
-More than capable (even sporty) engine and handling...
-Above-average luxury feel but not necessarily BMW price range...
-Did I mention 4-door and sporty?

Basically, the Millenia S fit many of these criteria, and many it did not.

Engine and Tranny: This car is well known for its Miller Cycle engine, which is a surprisingly small (2.3 L) V-6 that gets a large amount of horsepower (210 bhp) for its displacement, thanks to the standard Lysholm supercharger. This engine is only standard in the 'S' trim Millenia, which is the vehicle I test-drove. An engine that would positively SCREAM in a smaller car like a Civic or Jetta or Sentra size, but in a midsize (3500 lbs. curb weight) car it seems underpowered compared to the competition, especially since it does not offer a 5-speed at any trim level. The transmission is smooth and well-built, and the engine was not a dog by any means, but if you have so much as driven a '02 Nissan Maxima or '02 Acura TL Type S around the block, its obvious the Millenia is not up to par with its main competition in the slightest. 

Interior: This car has a nice interior, one that deserves to be classified as luxury, with standard leather seating and a 9 speaker Bose audio system. But even in this regard it disappoints somewhat with the limit of only 2 interior colors to choose from (beige or grey) and a smallish interior for a midsize car. The headroom and legroom certainly were more diminutive than I expected from the exterior appearance, and the fake wood trim would be better left off altogether... 

Handling: The car rides on very sporty looking chrome 17" alloy wheels with 215/50 r17 performance tires that look great and feel decent, however if they could have shaved just 200-300 lbs. of curb weight off this monster it would handle like a dream... Unfortunately I again feel compelled to harp on the fact that it has less headroom and legroom than its main competition in the size class, and still weighs a few hundred pounds more... Its a shame, because with such a small engine you would expect less overall weight. But even so it has a firm somewhat sporty ride and good handling for a 4-door sedan. 

In conclusion, I would love to see this engine in a slimmed down 4-door with some of the same luxury features and the nice sporty rolling stock that already comes part and parcel with this package. If Mazda could achieve that with their upcoming Mazda 6 sedan they may really have a winner on their hands...
