            I bought this to replace my even tinier Sipix Blink digicam.  These cameras aren't even comparable.  The Sony takes GREAT pictures for a 1.3 MP sensor.

You can find all the specs at Sonystyle.com, which is where I bought my U-10.  I also bought the case which is designed just for this camera.  Total price was $219 plus tax.

The U-10 is so small there really is no excuse to leave it behind.  I take it everywhere shooting anything and everything.  My higher quality Sony 505v seems to just sit in the camera bag now, coming out only for special occasions.  

Of course when a camera is this small, some compromises have to be made.  The only real user controls are flash options and a few gimmicky special FX.  There is no white balance control, and the camera's auto setting is easily fooled indoors.  Keep in mind however, that this is a snapshot camera and offering too many controls might confuse things a bit.

The operation of the U-10 is very speedy.  If you use the supplied 8mb memory stick, startup time is almost instantaneous.  Focusing and capturing are remarkably quick as well.  I am guessing the 1.3mp size and no zoom contribute to this.  No more missing that quirky smile my daughter makes once every two days.  The U-10 captures what I want at that decisive moment.  It is every bit as fast as most AF 35mm point and shooters.  My only niggle here is the camera startup time slows down a bit when you use larger memory sticks.  I rushed out and bought a 64mb stick from Fry's electronics for $30 so I could up the photo capacity.  The U-10 takes an extra second to read the card upon startup.  It's only one second, but it bugs me. 

Now to the images.  I have some examples online that give an idea of what the U-10 is capable of.

Again, for this size of a camera, I am very pleased with the images it produces.  Most tend to be a bit overexposed, but nothing 'auto contrast' in photoshop won't fix.  Printed at 4x6 I think you would be hard pressed to tell they were shot with a 1.3 MP digicam.  I really enjoy shooting in the 'illumination' mode.  This is basically a slow sync flash mode and works pretty reasonable results.  Examples of this are on my site.

No sooner than I had opened my new U-10 box, I read online Sony announced a 2MP version dubbed the U-20.  For those of you who don't have faith in a 1.3 MP camera, for $90 more you can buy the 2MP version.  For snapshots however, I don't see the value in it.  I am quite happy with my purchase, and more importantly, so is my wife.
