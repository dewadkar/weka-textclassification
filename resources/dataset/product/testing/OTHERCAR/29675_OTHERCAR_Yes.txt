            I just recently purchased a 2000 Buick Regal GS.  So far(3,000 miles later) I have not had one problem with it.  Lets start with the interior.  There is enough room to fit 4 people comfortably.  There is enough room for your knees as well as your head.  The seats are VERY comfortable.  I have the Grand Sport package, so that came with leather seats and all the nice gadgets.  It has 4 cupholders(front and back).The instrument cluster is set up very nicely. It comes with a HUD(Heads Up Display) It has a nice stock radio. It's Monsoon, and puts out about 200 watts.  Now lets get to the good stuff!
   The exterior of this car is very awesome.  It looks exactly like the Buick Century but it is a little smaller and a lot sportier.  I just love how the front is set up.  I like the way Buick set up the grile, and the fog lights that are underneath the bumper. The transmission on this car is very nice as well.  When it shifts into any gear, you can't feel a thing.  The handling on the GS is nice as well.  You could easly "Bob and Weave" through any traffic conditions.  It is like a sports car but with family sedan insurance rates. How cool is that?
  The engine on this car is just to die for.  The Buick Regal GS comes standard with a 240 horse power 3.8 liter Surpercharged V6.  This car can go 0-60 in about 6.6 seconds(I can vouch for that one!)  Say that you are at a red light, with the traction control off, ready to go. When the light turns green, you can floor it and sit there and spin the tires for about 3 to 4 seconds. No Lie.  It has a great Anti-Lock Braking System included on I think every model of the Buick Regal.  Over All, This car is a great sports car as well as a great luxury car all in one.
