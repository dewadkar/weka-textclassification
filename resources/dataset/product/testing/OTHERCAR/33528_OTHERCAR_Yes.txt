            I never thought that I'd end up owning a VW Beetle.  After all, I thought that they were cars for washed up hippies and trendsters.  Boy, was I wrong....

After my '99 Sentra was stolen (good riddance--http://solpo.epinions.com/auto-review-3F92-BB7B24C-39E4E6D7-prod1), my wife and I went looking for a replacement. After test driving and being quasi-impressed by the 2001 Hyundai Elantra, we decided against it because, well, Hyundais are embarrassing.  We drove by a VW dealer and, just for a lark, we test drove a Beetle.  Sure, it was fun, but it was also a bit small, and maybe too cute....

About a week later, we go to the VW dealership to buy a Jetta.  Nice car, but it reminded me of what a Toyota Corolla wishes it could grow up to be.  When I heard the payments, I was less than happy.  While walking around the dealership, we took another look at the Beetle.  And we came home with it.

Why?

First of all, yes, it is a bit small.  But when we test drove one with an armrest (our first test beetle was a stripped down GL), we realized that we weren't bumping arms and shoulders when we shifted (we both have broad shoulders).  In addition, the seats are very configurable, and there's a lot of front head and leg room.  Sure, the backseat is more of a comical afterthought than something actually usable, but, in all honesty, it wasn't any worse than our Sentra or our Jeep (and much better than the Integra coupe that we test drove, as well).  We've already done some moderate length drives, and we find it comfy.

Power.... I was concerned that the 115hp 2.0 liter 4 would be underpowered.  At 7000 feet, it's a bit slow going uphill, although it held 65 in 5th gear without trouble.  Other than that, though, it's smooth and relatively fast.  Acceleration isn't going to blow anyone away, but it is better than adequate for zooming through fast-moving freeway traffic.

Handling....  I cannot put my finger on what makes this car so fun to drive, but it's a blast.  Sure, there is a bit of body lean in fast, tight turns, but other than that, it is stable and really easy to handle.  We had no trouble driving it at 20mph over the posted recommended limit on curves, and, remember, the car is new and we still don't have a 100% feel for it.  Suffice it to say that it's the first car that I've owned where I feel like my lack of skill is the limiting factor in driving it, rather than its lack of cornering ability.

Brakes.... We haven't really pushed them yet, but they seem to be quite good.  One quasi-panic stop was quick and effective, without even triggering the ABS.

Ride....  OK.  It's a little firm.  Not bad for a small car, though.

Luxury....  We splurged.  Sunroof, heated leather seats, and the dealer-installed CD changer.  Every control is where you'd expect it to be (except for the cruise control, which is a bit hard to get at), and they feel good to press.  The stereo sounds great.  The A/C works wonderfully.  And the dial-operated sunroof is really nice.

VW really thought of a lot of details.  You can program the stereo to always start at the same volume (so that you don't get blasted out if you were listening to it loud the last time you drove).  The driver's door window controls are one-touch for up AND down (better than a Town Car!--http://solpo.epinions.com/auto-review-4DED-1FBAD282-39E9F431-prod4).  The seats are height adjustable.  The spare is full-size, and on and on.

So, what's the downside of the car?  We just found out that it is relatively easy to scratch up the rear fender flares when parallel parking it.  Although the heated seats have five settings, it seems that only 4 (low) and 5 (high) actually work--whether this is a problem or the way that it is designed remains to be seen.  Also, with about 1450 miles on it, it is pulling to the right more than a new car (or a car with 50000 miles on it) should.  And, no, we didn't run over any curbs or do anything stupid.

Let's be honest, here.  VW's have a reputation for lousy reliability.  Sure, the powertrains last forever, but power window motors, interior hardware, and the like are very expensive to replace.  We took a risk buying it, for sure.  But, for us, it's worth it.  It's nice to have a car with personality, and one which is fun to own and drive.

Oh, and one last thing....  Although it has a reputation for being a "chick" car, I feel relatively manly driving it.  Then again I may not feel the same way about it if it had something other than black paint with black leather....
