            OK, I've had this camera now for one year and have taken thousands upon thousands of photographs with it and I still love it!

It's compact, EXTREMELY well built, comes with rechargeable batteries, a charger and even an 8mb Memory Stick. Now, 8mb isn't much but let's face it, for the price of the camera it still doesn't represent bad value for money - it will probably hold 8 - 10 High quality images, so not bad going for a 'freebee' really? The picture quality really is superb - providing you don't use the Zoom AT ALL! 

This really is the Camera's one weakness; If you do use the zoom even in the slightest, the picture quality degrades dramatically. I have to say, it doesn't really bother me - I have a couple of nice Nikon SLR's with Zoom lenses should I really want those close ups - but it is worth bearing in mind when you buy the camera. The movie feature has no sound, but this is something that I knew at the time of purchase and, to be honest, the quality of the movies, even on the highest quality setting isn't that great, so it's no great loss.

Using the camera with a computer couldn't be simpler, especially if you are running Windows XP, which integrates the camera with the PC in an almost seamless fashion.

Anyway, if you are looking for a good, basic, high quality digital camera, which offers exceptional value for money - then this is the one for you!
