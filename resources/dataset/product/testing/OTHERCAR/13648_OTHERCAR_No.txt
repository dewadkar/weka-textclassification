            While it's a great value for a sport utility vehicle, it's just too small.  For a family of 4, we have absolutely no space for anything other than ourselves.  Our double stroller just barely fits in the back/trunk space, and the back seat is so close to the front that my daughters' legs are scrunched and touching the driver's seat.  It seems like it would be totally uncomfortable for an adult to sit in the back seat.  We have also had our share of problems with it - the power steering fluid had a leak, we've had to have the driver's window fixed 3 times now and it still jumps off track, and the battery has died, just 12 months after we purchased it.

I just realized that I should have written more about how great the customer service was that we got from the dealer. They always took the car in the day we called, and made the repairs free of charge. They did replace the battery at no cost, even though the warranty on the battery had already expired. As for the window, after the third time of trying to fix it, they finally just ordered a whole new window regulator and installed that for us, again at no charge. So, while we have had our share of problems, we have also been well taken care of by the dealer and their service department. As far as it being too small for us, we are now looking to buy a bigger car for me and the kids, and my husband will probably take the Kia for his commute to work.
