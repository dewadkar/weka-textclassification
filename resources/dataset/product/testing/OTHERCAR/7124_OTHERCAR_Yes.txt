            I just love these little fun mobiles!!!  I recently replaced my 1993 model with a 1999 model.  I hated to part with my 1993 black and tan, but my father had fallen in love with it.  To make a long story short, he bought my 1993 from me and I bought another Miata.  My black and tan (Ginger) always ran beautifully and she was a true joy to drive.  To replace her, I bought a beautiful red and tan Miata.  I wasn't sure what it would be like to drive a newer Miata.  It is like heaven.  She's like Ginger, but tighter and faster.  I'm sold on convertibles after driving these cars.  Now I can go on beautiful country rides with my dad...each of us in our own lovely Miatas.  I couldn't imagine a more perfect car...and the price is a steal.   <br><br>
