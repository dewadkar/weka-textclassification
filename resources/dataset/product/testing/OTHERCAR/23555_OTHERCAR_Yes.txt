            I have to say, that I don't personally own this car.  But I have on occasion, borrowed one.  My best friend has this car, it's a 1993 Nissan NX 1600.  She has never had a complaint about the car.  I on the other hand am a person who is 5 feet 7 inches tall.  I have long legs, and this is definitely <b>Not</b> a car meant for a tall person.  And whatever you do, don't ever sit in the back seat unless you want a crooked neck.

I had driven this car when I was about 8 and a half months pregnant and man let me tell you.  That was a job I can tell that much.  I had to barrow it for one of my weekly doctor visits, and when I got to the doctors office I had all I could do to get out of it.  It sits low to the ground, (I guess that's a feature of a small sports car)  
Even with the seat all the way back, my belly was still in the way of the steering wheel.  

I can however tell you that the car handles very well in the snow, and in the rain.  The car is still going strong, my friend hasn't had any problems with it really.  She has had it serviced as a car should be, and it's held up very well.  Still looks great, and sounds great, and almost runs like a new car.  

She bought the car used, with only 3,000 miles on it, and I personally think she got a great deal on the car.

I'm not quite sure what size engine it has, maybe a 4 cylinder. But Being that it's a small car, I can tell you, that its great on gas.
