            I've reached 7,500 miles on this car and i've only had it since mid December.  I must say I still love this car as much as when I bought it, I take that back, I love it more!!  

Contrary to what I've read in other reviews this car is fast.  It's no head jerking fast, but it's definately faster than most cars out there.  Then if you drop the shifter down into the manual gears the car definately moves and since it's a gated shifter it's almost as fun as driving an actual manual car.  I've gotten the car to 60 at right under 7 seconds.  If you leave it in total automatic the car is smoother than most cars in it's class and truly comfortable.  I'm 6'3"  and I have absolutely no problems with legroom or comfort.  I'm constantly taking 2 to 3 hour trips for work and I never get tired of sitting in the seats, just the right amount of cushioning and support. 

The luxury features in this car are great for the price.  One complaint I always hear is that this car is to expensive for what it is.  That's just crazy! It's true this car doesn't have what others have near this price range, but it also has more that other cars don't such as the best AWD system with the power of 212 horses, the super premium stereo (McIntosh, Bose truly doesn't compare), a real wood grain steering wheel (I haven't seen another car under 40 grand have this feature same as with the stereo). Also for being under 30 grand (i didn't pay over 30)  This has some very nice leather seats.  In a lot of other cars under thirty, you either get fake leather or real leather that looks fake.  

Then you also don't have to worry about seeing 20 million others on the road with you.

I definately have to say this is the best buy i've ever made!

Have I mentioned how great the Stereo is!!!!!!!!!!!!
