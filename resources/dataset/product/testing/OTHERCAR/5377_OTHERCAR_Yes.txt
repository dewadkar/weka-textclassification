            My Brat is a 87 model that I did not see listed. I bought the Brat used from a chemical company mechanic that used it only to commute 65 mile round trip to work. Had 139k when I purchased the Brat. Now has 165k and have replaced clutch cable,oil pump,{had a small crack in housing causing it to leak} and routine maintenance items. Only uses 1 quart of oil per 4k miles. Only gets 27 mpg when being driven very gently , I feel that 2200 lb car with 1.8 liter motor should get well past 30 mpg. Still runs great.Every thing still works on car including AC,4 wheel drive, low range and radio. All major components are original including clutch,engine and 4 speed transmission. If your looking an old Brat be wary of rust. My body is in excellent shape due to mild Carolina winters. But have driven in 6-8 inches of snow and believe you could not be in a better vehicle than a 4 wheel drive Subaru. Brats tend to ride a little hard like most older and smaller cars. Reliability of this vehicle has been outstanding and very simple to work on your self. Plus T-tops still do not leak even thou its 14 yrs. old.
