            I researched many SUV's for a few months before buying one and I have to say that it was the Honda name that got my attention on the CRV.  I was surprised by the amount of space that small SUV had! I also wanted to buy a car that I could drive 20,000+ miles per year and keep for more than the length of the loan.  

Unlike the RAV4 and the XTerra, it seemed that there was much more &quot;bang for your buck&quot; with the Honda and they did not have numerous models with just as many option packages.  The RAV4 was WAY too small in the rear which was important for my kids and large dog.  

I actually had my heart set on an AT vehicle this time and test drove ONLY automatics. However, the one 5 speed that I drove is the one that I bought.  I liked the way it handled much better.  

Honda put together an affordably great car together with the CRV EX which comes standard with AC, Cruise Control, PW, PDL, ABS, CD Stereo, Real Time Drive (still have no idea what that is), and an alarm with keyless entry. Both the front and rear seats are very comfortable.  I drive around with an adult in the front, two kids in the rear, and a greyhound in the rear and we are all quite comfortable.  The boys love the fold down arm rests in the rear as well as the adjustable reclining positions.  It handles like a car and moves well on all road conditions.  There is a TON of hidden storage in this car, including bins under the seats, in all the doors, and in the rear.  At freeway speeds of 70 - 80 mph, it runs a bit loud and it sounds like the engine is straining, but it manages to hold its own.  

The few things that I would suggest to Honda for improvements (other than the 1998 model that I have being a tad gutless which they fixed in the 1999 model by adding 20 more hp) would be to put the driver's side window controls back on the driver's door where we have all become accustomed to them being (rather than in the awkward place of on the front dash), and to give us a tilt steering wheel.  The position of the steering wheel moves up and down but it does not rock back and forth (is that because of safety purposes with an air bag?) and the wheel is just a bit too &quot;forward&quot; inclined for me.  I would also like to see side arm rests on the front seats become &quot;standard&quot;.  

Over all, this is the best car that I have owned and I am sure that it will hold its value very well throughout the course of its life.  I am managing to get approximately 25 mpg (about 80% of that highway miles).  <br><br>
