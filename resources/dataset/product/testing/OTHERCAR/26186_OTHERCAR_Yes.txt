            My oh my, how things change.  I was raised to believe that cars are basic transportation, that buying one for status is vulgar, that as long as it looks presentable and gets you from A to B reliably, that's all that is required.  I just bought a Volkswagen Passat GLX V6, and... and... (singing)<b><i> I was bliiiind, but now I seeeee!!!</b></i>

Sorry, folks.  Couldn't help it.  You see, I've made a wonderful decision in purchasing this fine piece of automotive machinery, and I'm feeling kind of smug.  Here's why...

<b>1 - The decision-making process</b> - Consumer Reports, Car and Driver magazine, and of course, Epinions were my guides.  I had already decided that I preferred to buy rather than lease, and that I wanted something of high quality that would retain its value and benefit by a relentless program of maintenance.  Every source I consulted pointed to Volkswagen as being both high quality and good value for the money.  The warrantees on these cars are incredible!  Friends and acquaintances all concurred.  Hey, when you have a car that doesn't have a single Epinion not recommending it, how can you say no?

I opted for the Passat over its smaller sibling, the Jetta, for safety reasons.  Long Island drivers are aggressive in Nassau County, and careless in Suffolk.  If I get hit by a big-haired, Amy-Fisher-accented bimbo who was applying her 85th coat of lip gloss instead of watching the road, I'd like to be in good enough shape to tell her off in my best North Shore snottitude. (How does that work? Lesson one - Clench teeth.  Raise one eyebrow.  Raise chin.  If you wear glasses, look over the tops.  Maintain clenched teeth and say, <i>"Good God, woman, are you mad?")</i> Both cars are built on the Audi A4 / A6 platform, with many advanced safety features standard.  I just think that size matters in a crash.  (Elevate your thoughts - I'm referring to the vehicular kind.)

<b>2 - Price research</b> - The internet is king here.  Carpoint.com, Autobytel.com, and the Kelley Blue Book will give you a crystal clear picture of the market for the make and model of the car you want at dealers in your area.  You can even arrange a purchase this way, but I don't recommend it.  The Passat comes in a basic model, the GLS, nicely equipped at around 23K.  Increasing levels of features cap out at around 28k for a GLX V6.  I chose this model because the V6 has the power I wanted, and the GLX has most of the features I wanted standard.  The only option on this model was a CD player - for around $500.  I declined, and will be installing a trunk-mounted CD changer this coming weekend.  The car is already wired for this - it's basically plug and play.

<b>3 - Features</b> - I won't copy the list from the "View more information" link here.  I will, however, list my favorites.  I must preface this by saying that the car is beautifully designed - controls are intuitive and everything is where it should be.  It's a pleasure to look at - very tasteful, with just enough chrome and wood to be luxurious without being over the top.  The similarities between this car and the Audi are striking.  It is available in a variety of understated, elegant colors.  I chose Reflex Silver - which looks clean even when coated with tree pollen - and a gray leather interior.  This car truly looks as though it cost thousands more than it did.  The Ink Blue (almost black) would have been my second choice.  Black and white were colors I did not consider, since they require constant cleaning and detailing. 

<b>Safety and security features</b> - front and side airbags, daytime running lights, crumple zone design.  The lock control will only open the driver's side door when pressed once - great for late-night mall runs.  The valet key will only open the door and start the car - it will not open the trunk or glove box.  There is a panic button on the lock control, and mounted into the driver's side visor is a remote control that can be programmed to your garage door, house alarm, and lights.

<b>Comfort features</b> - the GLX leather package includes top quality heated leather seats.  I spent <b>hours</b> in the car this weekend, and the seat was like a comfy chair.  This model also comes with a Monsoon stereo system that <i><b>cranks</i></b>.  So far, the tape deck has blasted much <b>Limp Bizkit</b> and <b>Durude</b>, though I am looking forward to adding the CD option.  It seems to prefer techno to AWR (Angry White Rap); maybe that's the German influence. The red and violet dashboard controls are a pleasure to read, and knobs and buttons can honestly be mastered in a matter of minutes. The climate control is thermostatic - it shuts off when the desired temperature has been reached.  The air conditioning system includes a HEPA filter to prevent pollen and exhaust fumes from entering the car's interior.  A moon roof can be controlled from the center ceiling panel, and has a baffle to prevent rain entry.  

<b>4 - Driving and handling</b> - How can I describe how it feels to drive something that is comfortable, but a far cry from the big American living rooms on wheels my family always drove?  This car has that same sense of interior comfort but the handling, the acceleration can only be described as <b><i>nimble</b></i>.  I briefly took it up to 100 on the Seaford / Oyster Bay Expressway (don't try this at home kids) - not a wobble or a wiggle - it felt like I was doing 40.  Yeah, and I'm sure I could explain it to the cops that way.  Changing lanes and taking tight turns is a joy; the car hugs the road and the road hugs back. What a pleasure to drive!  My only concern is that the smooth handling may lead me to inadvertent, unintentional speeding incidents.  I'm keeping my eye on the speedometer, but I can't make any promises.  The Tiptronic transmission allows for conversion from automatic to manual - downshifting is as simple as tapping the gearshift.  On a rain-slick, steep hill (Community Drive in Manhasset)this feature worked great.  I can't wait to try it in the snow.  Note that the car is also available in a four wheel drive model.  I declined this because Long Island's climate doesn't merit it - the car already has a traction control system.  Also, the gas mileage on the car would suffer significantly with four wheel drive engaged all the time.  As it is, it gets an average of 20 MPG - not bad for a V6.

<b>5 - The dealership</b> - I went to the <b>Bayside Volkswagen Saab Dealership</b>, because my buddy Dominick's girlfriend has a relative that manages the place.  I have to say that they made the experience a pleasure.  The whole process could not have been more painless and stress-free.  So, I offer special thanks to David Gallego, Sales Manager, Angelo Alexiadis, a most professional salesman who knows his product well, and Evelyn Lasky, who handled the paperwork part of my transaction in a wonderfully professional and charming manner.  It must be nice to be able to sell a product you are justifiably proud of.  I really wouldn't consider making future purchases anywhere else.

I suppose I'll have to get a laptop next, so I can write Epinions from the road!!!

<b>This Epinion is dedicated to Dominick, my oldest friend, and his lovely, talented, and extremely well-connected girlfriend Nora, without whom I would have been wandering in the Long Island car desert for 40 years.  Also to my best friend Dave, whose release from indentured chauffer-tude will require some serious festivities. Thanks guys - next dinner's on me.</b>
