            My husband and I were supposed to receive this camera for Christmas.  However, our due-in-January baby arrived before Christmas, so my in-laws decided we should have this gift early, too.  We are so glad they did.

This camera takes superb pictures, and it is very easy to use, too.  One feature I especially like is that after taking the picture, you can preview it on the screen before you decide whether to keep it or not.  If you don't like a picture, you can easily delete it.  For a middle-of-the-line camera, it has many other wonderful features, as well.  You can zoom in on the subject, of course, as with most other cameras.  There's also a Self-Timer that gives you a ten-second delay, so you can be in a picture, too, if there's no one else around to take it.  

Taking pictures is just the <b>beginning</b> of the fun you can have with this camera.  Once you've captured the images, it is very easy to transfer them to your computer.  Then you can do what you want with them--get creative!  You can create a photo album, a web page, send photos by e-mail, and even frame your pictures with some templates that are supplied on the camera's memory card.  I love to take pictures of our baby daughter and e-mail them to my husband at work.  

Printing the pictures yourself is easy, too.  It is recommended that you use Kodak Inkjet Photo Paper for this.  The prints come out alright when you print them out at home.  If you want good quality prints, you'll need a high-end printer.  (Or just have someone print them out at work if they have access to a professional-quality printer there.)  If you you choose, you can take your picture card to a Kodak Picture Maker System, which is available in most places that develop regular pictures.  I think I even saw this being offered at Target now. The prices are bound to be better there than at one of those &quot;professional&quot; photo places.  It is <b>VERY</b> expensive when you take the picture card to one of these places, believe me.  

I am usually not good with electronics, because I find many things too complicated and the manuals that come with them of little or no help at all.  That's not the case here, that's for sure.  The User's Guide that accompanies this camera makes this camera just so---useable.  Anyone can understand the instructions, believe me.  Even my husband will have to admit that I've been taking some GREAT pictures lately  :o)
