            I live in Western PA which has plenty of hills and usually recieves a fair amount of snow.  I wanted to be able to haul 4 adults and get through whatever bad weather mother nature could throw my way.  The Montero Sport LS 4WD delivers!
I purchased this vehicle in 11/03 and it was a used model with only 27,200 miles on it.  The previous owner had taken excellent care of this SUV.  So far, I have put 3000 miles on it and love it.
I am getting about 16 mpg around town, up & down hills, and city driving.  I got 20 mpg on the highway on a recent trip down to KY.
You sit up high enough in the seat so visibilty is good.  Blind spots appear to be minimal.  It's narrow track does get you bounced around a bit on a windy day out on the highway. Size was a necessity for me to fit it in my garage. The tires that came with mine are more suitable for off-road work so the ride on the streets is a bit rough, but not too uncomfortable.
Overall, I am quite pleased with my purchase.  Even the wife enjoys driving it and that is saying something as it is hard to get her out from behind the wheel of her minivan.
If you are looking for a hard-working SUV that is more of a truck than a car, consider this vehicle.
