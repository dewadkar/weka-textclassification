            I've been shopping for a small truck for a while, and when the new baby was born I finally crumpled and went to get one.  I'd already researched them, and had decided upon the Sportage due to price, dealer availability, rebate deals, and reviews that this was the machine for me.

I can say, honestly, after a month I am very pleased.  I took it off the tarmac for the first time within days of purchasing it, and was very pleased with it's ability there.  I have been very happy with it's overall clearance and view, and the handling is better than many trucks I have driven.  It doesn't drive like a car, but it shouldn't.

I'm pretty impressed with the interior comforts and room overall, and I finally have the cargo space to haul when needed that my small car had completely deprived me of.

When I picked it up, it was "last year's model", since there is no 2003 model, and got a wonderful rebate because of it.  I opted to get the "Drivechain Wraparound" additional insurance, extending the vehicle's full warrantee to match the drivechain warrantee.  I like that, we'll see how useful it is somewhere down the road if I have it more than 5 years.

Here's hoping, because I think I'm in love.

A few notes:  I picked up the manual transmission LE model, with a few very welcome extras, but it was the keyless entry that clinched the deal.  Of course, here in the south, A/C is a requirement and this seems not to lose power with A/C on.
