            Upon graduation from college in 1996, I was given my parent's 1993 Toyota camry (since they upgraded to now 2 Avalons).  It had 60,000 miles on it and after a long 3,500 mile road trip throughout the United States,it worked without failure at its new home in Nederland, CO at 10,000 feet.  Now this is prime 4x4 country and of course there were days where no 2 wheel drive vechile could ever make it out alive.  But relative to other 2 wheel drives of various makes and types from Trucks, to compacts (and after the installation of studed snow tires in the winter) my Camry always took me over all the mountain passes and ski resorts I still yearn for!  The anti-lock brakes have saved me from many a wrecks and I cannot commend Toyota more for (unlike my parents) I abuse my vehicles!  Now it's in Washington DC always there to take me where I need to go after 120,000 miles.  I only performed minor necessary repairs such as oil (of course!), transmission, and brake fluids, coolent, brakes (twice because of the mountains), and timing belt.  Of course, all cars require this (and usually more).  Water pump should be replaced though it works fine.  The only downside to this car is it's not a very fun car to drive, like my old Jetta.  There's no road feel and the car is too soft to my preferences.  But with its dependability and safety (my brother was in a very serious accident in his 1993 Camry that was broadsided by a commercial truck and was OK) I'm not complaining!  The car drives and sounds like it's not even half dead!
