            I love the Alero. Let me tell you, I researched so many cars before narrowing down my search and Alero always came out on top. I was a first time (new) car buyer. I was looking for a classy, yet sporty vehicle with a V6 engine. Of course, I also would prefer leather and other options if I could afford them, but I found many times I couldn't with the other cars I researched. However, the Alero GLS (top model) comes standard with DISC brakes, ETS, leather interior, V6, and a CD player. The value was outstanding. 

I am not a car enthusiast, but I can tell you from a woman's perspective what I think of my car. My Alero GLS coupe is Meadow Green, which is a dark, metallic green. It has a spoiler, sunroof, dynamic bass, and the sports suspension package. The ride is magnificent. I can feel the road and it takes turns like a dream. The V6 never lets me down and the braking system is outstanding. I feel very safe in this car. I also like the extras it includes, such as the warning light that alerts you when a tire is low.

The Alero has a LOT of extra room. The trunk is very roomy and has a cargo net. The back seat can fit up to three normal sized adults. There is plenty of leg room for everyone. 

Overall, I am extremely pleased with my car. It was not easy to locate the exact model I wanted, but everything worked out in the end. I don't think I could be more pleased.<br><br>
