            I'm from the &quot;old school&quot; and grew up with rear wheel drive cars, so I tend to be weary about front wheel drive.
To tell you the truth, I purchased a 1999 Hyundai Elantra for the sole purpose of saving money, both on gas and maintenance...period.
My car is a 5-spd model 4 door.  I recently took a road trip from Baltimore to Columbia, SC.  A 520 mile trip each way, and here's my opinion of this car.

It gets fairly good gas milege. I averaged 29mpg doing 75 to 85 mph!!
The ride was smooth for a small car.  The seats are very good on the back.  The lumbar support helped a lot.  I liked the layout of the instruments (although I prefer a tachometer in a stick shift vehicle) mine doesn't have one.  The AM/FM/CD radio is nice too.  The fit and trim of the interior shows Hyundai is going in the right direction.  Cruise control is much smoother with a manual shift on hills.
The car comes with a 10 year/100,000 mile engine/drivetrain warranty, probably the best on the market.
My car pulls to the right when getting underway, I asked about this to a mechanic at the dealership and was told it is caused by the main drive wheel. <br><br>
