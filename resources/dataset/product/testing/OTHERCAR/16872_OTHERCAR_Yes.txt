               I bought my '90 Maxima SE in '94 with over 88,000 miles on it. I still have it and my problems with it have been minimal. Now the car has over 135,000 miles on it and it's still running almost as well as it did 5 years ago. The car is classified as a sports sedan and I think I know why. The 6-cylinder engine does hog up more gas than other cars in its class, but the smooth ride is worth it. Since I bought it, I've only had to change the timing belt (although that was preventative care), the battery, the brake pad linings, and the front headlight.  In addition, the car seats are extremely comfortable.
   I've spoken to other people who own Maximas and their problems were the same as mine- the bulbs in the headlights need to be changed at a faster rate than usual and the power windows begin to slow down- forcing me to manually pull up the window on the passenger side. 
   Newer versions of the Maxima are even better- with more space in the interior and even smoother rides. The buying price is always reasonable and it always holds the road well. Definitely a great car to have.<br><br>
