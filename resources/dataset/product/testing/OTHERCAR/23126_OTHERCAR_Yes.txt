              My 1998 Dodge Stratus has been a really good car, even though I have had my share of problems. 
  First of all, let me tell you about my "lovely" car- I bought the car used w/64K miles in early March 2003 from a local broker. When I examined and bought the car, it was in excellent condition with a clean interior. The paint color is coal or graphite gray, it includes: 2.4L (16 valve) automatic 4 cylinder engine, power steering w/cruise, alloy wheels, manual windows & locks (my car), fm/am stereo, a/c & heating, center console, trunk-access back seat, cloth interior (mine is a dark blue pattern with black dash and console). Of course, you can find the loaded or power package ones, though it is kind of hard finding a decent used late 90s Stratus because people drive them to death (like Hondas). The trunk is quite large to fit all the junk we buy; the cabin has room for everyone- 3 average size individuals sit comfortably in the back, while 2 up front. *The gas pedals can be sometimes touchy, but it isn't serious. 

  Now, to after the purchase- Everything was going fine until about 1 week after purchase- the car began to leak a little oil after I alternated the wheels one weekend. After a couple of days of minor leaking, it became a quart. I knew something was really wrong. So, I went to a mechanic and got it checked, the problem was a cracked head gasket! He did not have the labor to fix it, so I went to our local Dodge dealership. They are a excellent group of people and are very helpful at Mark Dodge in Mobile, AL. It took about 5 days of work at a cost of around $800 because they had to pretty much take out the engine to get to the problem. I also got the brakes & timing belt replaced as well as the a/c charged. A grand total around $1,100 in repairs! Recently (Aug. '03), I had the a/c fixed due to worn out connections ($600).  

~For used car updates or information, please see the Consumer Reports magazine (annual auto issue)/book. Consumer Reports gives the '98 Stratus a red check & for above reliability for that year and is recommended.
