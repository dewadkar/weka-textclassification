            Even though I consider myself somewhat of a "car guy" I was not aware that Infiniti was bringing the skyline platform to the US.  That was of course until January of 2002 when I saw a picture of the Nissan Skyline with an infiniti belt buckle on the front on the cover of Automobile magazine.  

Once I saw the G35 at the 2002 Chicago auto show, I knew I needed to have one.  So many things are attractive about this car (ok the trunk handle isn't one of them)but at least the doggie door handle was fixed.  Last October I decided it was time to part ways with my beloved Honda and venture into my local Infiniti dealership.  I drove out with a 2003 G35 Sedan, Garnett Fire exterior with the Graphite Interior.  I bought the car as a dealer demo with 1300 miles on it.  Although I was hesistant to buy the demo, the $1500 off MSRP and 4yr/60K mile warranty eased my nerves a little


Exterior - 

The design speaks for itself.  If you don't like it, fine! I happen to think it's a gorgeous shape.  As with most Infiniti's the paint has nice lustre, and blemish free.  The body panels are well fitted, with few noticable gaps.  My only complaint after nine months is that there is a gap where the rear windshield meets the trunk lid.  It's wide open for leafs and other junk to collect.  The same can be said for the trim that runs along the roof of the car, it also gathers junk in it.  This makes waxing the car a little time consuming.  


Interior - 

It's pretty easy to spot where Infiniti saved a couple of bucks.  The leather in this car is not as nice as I had come to expect from Infiniti.  My family has had 2 Infiniti QX4s which have outstanding interior appointments.  Even though I take great care of my G, the leather has worn in more than expected over 9 months.  I also don't like the fact that the leather is perforated, so it collects crap in it (Crumbs , leather cleaner, etc.)  Enough with the complaints, I love this car.  the entire gauge cluster moves along with the steering wheel, which makes it very easy to read.  I think all the controls are very easy to read, I have had no trouble with the amber color that others have complained about.  The sound from the standard six disk CD changer is good enough for my purposes.  Finally, the automatic climate control works very well.  The A/C is terrific which comes in handy here in Chicago.


Driving - 

The VQ engine in the G35 (same as Nissan Maxima) is tuned up and bored out a little to kick out 260HP and 260 FT LB of torque.  It's enough to light up the tires when driving in auto stick mode.  The car grips very well for a 4 door on the standard 17 inch Goodyear Eagle RS/A tires.  I think some better tires will help this car out immensly.  Acceleration is very good (around 6.1 - 6.5) seconds 0-60.  I have found that you really cannot get a good feel for this car until you turn off the intrusive traction control and switch the automatic over to the manu-matic mode.  I do find myself wishing I had waited until February of this year for the 6 speed manual version of the G35.   Once the traction control is off, the car takes on a new feeling.  A word of warning, if you have not driven a rear wheel drive car before, the G exhibits all the good / bad behaviors of a RWD.  With traction control off, the back end will slide under power while turning.  I consider this a plus, some other will not.  

My one complaint is in the gas mileage dept.  Infiniti promised 20 /25 for this car.  In the winter, while driving like a saint, I was getting barely 16mpg.  This is also with premium fuel.  Now that winter has passed here in Chicago, and the oxygenated fuel is gone, I'm still only getting about 19mpg at best.  This is also a car that likes to be driven.  I do not get better mileage while driving like grandma, it want to be pushed hard.  


My only other complaint with this car is the soft paint.  It chips very easily.  Although it seems like I'm complaining, I love this car.  I could not be happier with my choice.  It's a perfect blend of power, style, performance, and economy.
