                   This may be the first case when Chevy over designed a brake system. The rear brakes on Chevy's '91-'92 Luminas, before they introduced the anti-lock system on the model, are over designed to the point of being too delicate. When the car is driven in states where salt and snow are a problem, the rear brakes will corrode and fail within 18 months.
       My parents bought a used 1991 Lumina in '95 as a &quot;Family shared&quot; vehicle. I learned to drive in the car. That model Lumina is the automotive equivalent of &quot;Teen training wheels&quot;. It drove straight, was easy to control around turns, and had plenty of power. The 3.1L V6 gives the Lumina a good horsepower to weight ratio, so it never felt strained. I loved the handling. On one occasion ( don't tell the parents! ) I topped 100mph on a country road.
       Handling was this Lumina's forte', but not maintenance. First of all, the Lumina's low front end and hood ( for style ) means a cramped engine compartment. Basic engine tune-ups are a nightmare. In cars with a front wheel drive set-up, the engine is mounted at a 90 degree angle. This means 3 spark plugs in the front, 3 in the back of the compartment. Despite many attempts, neither my father or I could change the rear plugs. The originals remain to this day. I recommend you take yours to a good mechanic for tune-ups. Avoiding the bleeding knuckles is worth the money.
     On to the brakes. After 1 1/2 years, and one Rochester NY winter, the Lumina's rear brakes failed. About 30% of stopping power gone almost overnight. We took the wheels off and were amazed at what we saw. On the left side, the caliper and pads had gouged a canal-like crevice in the rotor. I swear the crevice was almost half an inch deep, almost clear through the rotor. The break pads were also fused to the caliper ( imagine  the heat it must have took! ). On the right, one break pad was missing! We had to replace the calipers, rotors, and pads. I have never seen such a ridiculous sight in a vehicle since! It should be noted that a Class-Action lawsuit was pursued a couple of years ago against Chevy for the design errors in the brakes.
       DON'T buy this model car if you live in areas where snow and salt are a problem. You might be putting your family in danger. We are planning to sell ours, and buy a vehicle better suited for winter weather. If you love Luminas, please save up and buy a '95 or newer model. <br><br>
