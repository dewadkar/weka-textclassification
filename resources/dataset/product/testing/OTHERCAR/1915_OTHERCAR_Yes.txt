            Although most the cars I test drove during the previous weeks have been two door sports coupes such as the Celica and Prelude, I decided to also take the new 2000 Nissan Maxima for a spin while I was at the Nissan dealership.  Although I was very impressed with the power the engine provided, overall the design was a bit on the �family� end for me.  Overall though, I was impressed with what I drove.  

<b>Engine</b>
I must admit that I loved the power the new Maxima provides from the minute I began driving.  The GXE model comes with a 3.0 liter DOHC V-6 engine that produces 222 horses while driving.  And believe me, you can feel the difference while you are behind the wheel.  From the moment you step down on the accelerator, the car instantly sends you forward.  For those who are not used to this much power behind such a small car, it maybe a little too much to handle.  Not to worry though, the Maxima�s ride is smooth despite the powerful engine.  The GXE comes with both the automatic and standard transmission.  My advice is to choose the standard transmission to fully take advantage of the power.

<b>Interior</b>
My first thought when I sat down in the 2000 Nissan Maxima was the surprising amount of room.  The front seats were very roomy and could be comfortable even on long trips.  The backseats where also roomy and would not become uncomfortable for two adults during a long trip.  All the Maxima�s gauges are easy to read and accessible.  The air conditioning cools the car very fast and does not affect the car�s power too much.  When I looked at the truck of the Maxima I was surprised with how big it was.  A family of four would have no problem with luggage for a weekend vacation.  The stereo system is decent but nothing extraordinary.  The car comes with a standard six speakers.

<b>Exterior</b>
In my opinion, the exterior of the new Maxima is nothing special.  This is one of the main reasons why I would not purchase this car at the present time.  For a car that has so much power, the outside simply does not look sporty enough.  I am aware that this car is a four door sedan so it is unfair to compare the looks to a Celica or Eclipse, but at the same time Nissan could make this car look less like a �family car�.  Some people might argue that Nissan redesigned the 2000 model to look less like a �family car� and have more of a sporty feel to it, but in my mind they did not go far enough.  There are some definite positives to the exterior of the Maxima.  The car comes with 15� alloy wheels that definitely add to the sporty ness feel.  A theft deterrent system and remote keyless entry are also included.

<b>Handling</b>
For the most part, the Maxima�s handling is very responsive.  During my test drive I took the car on some winding back roads it performed pretty good.  Overall I would describe the handling as above average although it could be better.  There were a couple times during the drive were the a slight motion on the steering wheel caused the car to veer over quite extensively.  This was at higher speeds and is not a major problem but more something just to be aware of.  

Overall the car�s ride was very smooth.  Bumps and potholes in the road were virtually eliminated.  Cabin noise was at a minimum and all speeds and conditions.

<b>Safety</b>
The Maxima comes with the basic safety features found in most cars.  Dual front airbags and an ABS braking system are standard.

<b>Reliability</b>
Nissans and especially Maximas have been known to be reliable in the past.  The 2000 was redesigned but this should not be a problem in the future.  The 2000 Nissan Maxima should have no trouble as far as reliability is concerned.

<b>Price</b>
The Maxima starts at around $23,000 but this is for a totally stripped down model.  While I was looking at Maxima�s in the parking lot I found none that were priced this low.  The lowest I found were in the $25,000 range.  For a high end Maxima with various features expect to pay almost $30,000.  

Overall I liked the 2000 Nissan Maxima.  I loved the power that the V6 engine provided.  At times, it seems more like your driving a sports coupe rather then a four door sedan.  In my opinion, the exterior of the car could have been better designed to give the car a more sporty feel.  Overall though, the Maxima is a very nice drive.
