            Chevy Cavalier:  Buyer Beware.

While the company claims that this car has been rated # 1 in it's class, let's compare the cars in that class....

Cons: GM Canada is horrible to deal with when there is any defects in the car which are many (airbags deploy for no reason, tires wear easily, lights - interior and exterior) malfunction.  All in all you get little for what you pay for.  The air brakes are noisy and shudder at all applications.

Pro:  It is an affordable car for almost anyone but then you must correct the problems which aren't always covered under warranty.  I did enjoy the look of the car - a sporty model for an inexpensive price.

All in all you have to pay a great deal of money for an inexpensive car.  you are better off investing the money first and getting what you need and want - a reliable vehicle.  Unfortunately I would not recommend this car to anyone.<br><br>
