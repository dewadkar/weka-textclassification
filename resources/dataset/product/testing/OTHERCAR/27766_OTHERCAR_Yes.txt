                 I've been circling digital cameras like a hungry hawk for a few years now, yet I always stopped short for two reasons - price and practicality.  Most people don't spend around $1000 on a camera.  Most people don't carry around a giant, feature-packed camera with them.  I'm like most people - I don't need or want any of that.  

     Most people have $100 35mm or APS point-and-shoot cameras that are stuffed into pockets and purses whenever they travel or attend special occasions.  That was me - all I wanted was a digital version of a pocket-sized point-and-shoot camera.  Alas, I would have to wait...  Alas, that is, until Canon came up with the Powershot S100 Digital Elph.

     As soon as I saw that Canon had reduced the price, I decided to order one...

     So after a couple months of living with the Digital Elph, here's what I have to say about it.  So far, so good. 


THE GOOD:
     --I take it to parties and on trips, and I just snap away without a hassle.  The picture quality is remarkably good for something so small - although you can manually adjust things like white balance and exposure, I just keep most settings on auto.  On the lowest quality picture setting you can fit over 50 pictures onto the included 8MB CompactFlash card (that's the name of the type of memory it uses) - I've found the lowest setting just fine for regular pictures to e-mail to friends, etc. - I suppose you could use the higher-quality settings for special group photos and sceneries (especially if you want to enlarge them on a printer).  
     --The panoramic mode allows you to take wide sceneries like beach sunsets, or 360 degree pictures of a room of people - very nifty feature!
     --Basically, this is a great digital version of your good 'ole point-and-shoot camera.
     --Rugged metal construction makes it feel sturdy, despite its tiny size.


THE BAD:
     --Well, to be honest, there isn't much to say here - I would've liked it alot more if the camera came with a spare battery (the Lithium Ion battery works fine, but I'd like to be able to use the camera without having to worry about running out of juice).  Additionally, a larger memory card would've been nice too - to those who will use the camera to take alot of high-quality pictures, a larger memory card is a necessity - for me, I think 8MB suits me just fine - 50 or so pictures is more than enough...
     --The small size of it may be too small for those of you with larger hands...

     If you're thinking about getting a newfangled digital camera to possibly replace your regular 'ole film point-and-shoot camera, this is the camera for you.

UPDATE:
So I've had this camera for over a year now, and I still think it's great! - Some strong recommendations - 

1: Get a bigger Compactflash memory card - I have a 64MB card and I never seem to run out of space - the battery runs out of juice before you can reach the limits of the memory card - with an extra battery, a 128MB card would be a great idea!

2: Get a Compactflash memory card reader for your computer! (it hooks up to your computer via a USB port)- Transferring images to your computer is sooo much easier and quicker this way - and you don't eat up your camera battery this way! -(I got mine for 20 bucks at Staples)

3: Consider getting a spare battery - I have not found aftermarket batteries for this camera yet, but the Canon brand batteries are about 40 bucks - sometimes an invaluable insurance when attending special occasions like weddings.
