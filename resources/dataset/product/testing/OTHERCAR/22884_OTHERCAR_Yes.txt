              My wife and I purchased a used 1995 Toyota Avalon XLS because we wanted a big back seat.  We were driving a Buick Skylark, and with a new baby and that big ole' baby seat, it wasn't cutting it.  The baby seat was hitting the driver's and passenger's seat.  My wife told me that she would not drive a mini-van (I can't blame her), and I already had a four wheel drive, so she wanted another car.  The Avalon was an obvious candidate.
    
  I had read much information concerning the Avalon.  Great ride, quiet, roomy, powerful.  I figured that we would take the plunge and throw down some serious cash on this car (the Avalon was two and a half years old when we bought it, and it wasn't cheap).  That is one of the drawbacks of this car, they are expensive to buy.  When the dealer was showing me this used Avalon, he showed me a new one that I could lease for a few bucks more a month.  I did the math, and betting on Toyota reliability, I bought the used car instead.

  Our model is the white on tan interior with XLS trim level.  This car features all power to include a power moonroof.  The interior is trimmed with leather seating areas.  Climate control is a nice option that makes setting heating and cooling controls a one knob proposition.  The ride of the Avalon could be compared to a Buick with quick steering.  The silky 3.0 liter V-6 is standard equipment in all Avalons to date.
  
  The Avalon features a flawless powertrain.  The 3.0 liter DOHC engine is very smooth and powerful.  It runs like clockwork, it is a sewing machine.  Kids pulling up next to you in little Hondas with big tail pipes feel awfully bad when you totally smoke them off the line.  The Avalon will surprise many people with its acceleration.  The transmission is smooth and effortless.  The Avalon is what I was driving when I received my first traffic ticket in 12 years.  It is a very quick car.
  
  My particular Avalon has wind noise around the B-pillars, a problem common in 95 Avalons.  I researched having the window gasket replaced, it panned out to be around $500.  Toyota built a retrofit kit for the windshield and mirrors to help mitigate wind noise, and they also put out a technical service bulletin to cover this problem.  If your car is out of warranty, however, you will either have to listen to wind howl or fork out some cash.  I am currently still listening to wind howl.  Another noise issue is that of the rear tires.  If you have some cheap skins on your car, you will hear them.  I have some Toyo tires on the car now, they are less than a year old, and I am thinking about tossing them for some new Michelins or something to help get rid of vibration and noise.  I had my local Toyota dealer check the car out, he says the rear tires are bad.  They are less than a year old, with almost full tread, but he said his inspection showed they are scalloped.  I'm going to try and get the tire dealer to get me some new skins on the rear, maybe he'll prorate.

<i>Update Aug 06, 2000: after some time on the alignment rack, the car was found to have foundered, with seriously misaligned rear wheels.  After this situation was corrected and the tires trued, the vibration and noise problem, history.</i>

  Driving a car this nice is bittersweet when you get wind noise and vibration.  If you are in the market for a used one, check it out at highway speeds before throwing down on it.
  
  In the end, this car is incredibly reliable, with only minor problems with noise.  I have had no major work done on the car, and it is rolling over 90,000 miles any day now.  The leather and sunroof are nice, and with the new body style rolling in, you could probably strike a sweet deal on a used one (the only way I buy a car anymore).  Give the car a good test drive before you buy, though, and if it is howling, get them to fix it beforehand.  Caveot Emptor! 

<b>Update 21 Feb 01:</b> The power steering ram failed in the automobile at 96,000 miles.  The repair, which occurred right at the end of my extended warranty cost $1300!  Also, a rear power window motor failed and replaced under warranty.  It seems that some of the peripherals of the Avalon are not quite as reliable as the engine and transmission.
