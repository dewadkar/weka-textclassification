            This vehicle is very safe in the type of weather that is here in Lake Placid. In the morning the 4 wheel drive is used frequently in just getting out of the driveway into an unplowed country road.
The vehicle is very handy when there are groceries to haul and grandchildren to take to their various activities.There is plenty of power to go up the many hills in the region ;although one must expect that with all that power is the downside of a larger gasoline bill-it is a bit of a hog.
The interior of the Durango has many convenient features that are easy to find while driving.There is no reaching for things even for a short driver like myself. The side view mirror on the drivers side was a problem in the beginning.There seemed to be a blind spot when I made a left hand turn.
I was able to get around this by focusing around the mirror. This probably due to the fact that I am not very tall.

The vehicle is fun to drive and I think that I will enjoy  it fully as the winter progresses.
