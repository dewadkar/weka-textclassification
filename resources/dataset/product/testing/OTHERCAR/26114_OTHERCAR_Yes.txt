               I run a family webpage and desperately wanted a digital camera to shoot family events etc. to post on the web. Money being tight I started to look at the lower priced units (under $200) and was definitely not happy with what I was seeing. From reading reviews on Epinion and talking to unhappy camera owners I found that these lower priced cameras left a lot to be desired. 
   Then while browsing Ebay for deals, I came across an ad for the Mustek GSmart 350. Having been a satisfied customer of Mustek for quite a while (very happy with my Mustek Scanner), I decided to check it out. At the time the camera was pretty new and I could not find any reviews on it whatsoever. I decided to take a chance and bought the camera on-line for the incredible price of $40.00 (heck I figured, not a bad risk at that price).
   I really didn't have great expectations for the camera, but was very quickly and pleasantly surprised when I received it. It's very lightweight, nice looking and easy to operate. It has features that compare with the more pricy models such as easy viewing of pictures taken, easy deletion of pics you don't want to keep, ability to turn flash on/off, 2X zoom, memory card comparable for more pictures, normal/high res modes and can even be used as a live on-line camera for computer video! Also, battery life is much improved over other cameras.
   The picture quality is what surprised me most. When taking pictures outside or in decent light the resolution is great, much more than I expected. Even pictures taken indoors on a sunny day come out good. Darker rooms or night pics are not quite so good. The flash for some reason doesn't seem to help much or at all either. Don't understand this one but it is the only drawback to the camera that I have found. It comes with the ability to take only 7 pictures without a memory card which is not much at all, but card prices are coming down and with a rather inexpensive 16Mb card you can suddenly store over 130 pictures at a time. 
   All in all I give two big thumbs up to this camera. Granted I only spent $40.00 for it, but had I spent the normal price of $150.00 or so I would still be pleased.
