            The '03 Rio is a great car for point A to point B driving. If you want spice in your life look elsewhere. I've driven an '02 Rio and Kia did a fantastic job of fixing all the little, yet irritating things that were wrong with it for the '03 model year. The styling is way better than the previous years, especially the hood and front end. The interior has also been greatly improved the features that were previously awkward to use or ugly have now been fixed, such as the cup holders and the added map lights, I also like the leather-look boot on the parking brake handle. I'd say the best interior improvement is the shift-indicator on the instrument cluster (for the automatic transmission only), I'm a big guy and it's almost impossible for me to look down and see what gear I'm in, so they added an indicator to the dash that lights up P through to 1 for whatever gear you're in. This is a feature usually reserved for more pricey/bigger cars. I love it! They also changed the A/C controls so you can now stop it from turning the A/C on whenever you have it on defrost, that drove me nuts on the '02 model.
Kia also boosted (slightly!) the torque and horsepower to 104 of each, up from 96 in the last model. Although to be honest you can't tell the difference.

Now for the cons: 
Although I've had no real trouble the engine does like to stumble when you first start it cold sometimes, and the auto transmission likes to shift WAY too hard sometimes, it did it so hard one time it chirped the tires which is hard to do even intentionally with this thing! It seems to do this if you've been slowing down and then hit the gas, (not even that much gas), and it'll downshift so hard it feels like someone rear-ended you. And of course the biggest con is just the fact that that 104 horses gets you nowhere slowly!

Overall though it's a good car and the warranty is amazing. The pricing is good too. Mine is nearly loaded with options and all for the price of what a totally base model of any other car would cost. Also the options aren't badly priced $250 gets you power windows and locks and $400 gets you Power Steering, Tilt Wheel, Tachometer, and some other stuff I can't remember.
