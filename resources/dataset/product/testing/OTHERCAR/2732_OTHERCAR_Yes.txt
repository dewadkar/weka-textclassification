            Over the last 3 years I have had a chance to get familiar with the 1997 Suburban.  I like most of the things about it especially the interior comfort and the venerable 350 V8.  It comes with plenty of power to move the giant down the road, and even to &quot;bark&quot; the tires if one feels inclined to do so.  The interior is a dream, the LT trim fitted with leather and the rest of the options is very classy and comfortable.  The 42 gallon gas tank makes the Suburban a good choice to drive long distances, but have a credit card handy when you need a fill up.  The gas mileage on the highway is fairly good considering the size of the Suburban, but around town it can really drink some gas.  The reliability isn't all that great with us needing major work done to the brakes and AC unit, but the dealership was quick and convenient with getting the work done and at a decent price.  The size of the Suburban accompanied by the questionable turning radius on all Chevrolets makes it difficult to maneuver in parking lots and small back roads.  Also, I detested a significant amount of sway at speeds greater than 50mph which made it a little hard to keep on the road when traveling.  Overall, it was a good experience and I do recommend this vehicle to anyone who needs an everyday driver with the capabilities of off roading and transporting a lot of cargo.<br><br>
