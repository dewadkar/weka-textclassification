            First let me tell you how I buy a car.  First thing I do is see how much money I can spend.  Then, I hit as many dealers as I can, looking for a solid car, with as much power as I can cram into my budget.  As I find candidates that fill my requirements, I take them for a test drive.  

Now, when I'm on a test drive, I'm looking for a car that makes me smile.  I've already kicked the tires, looked under the hood, checked the lot under the car for wet spots, etc..  But all that is meaningless if the car brings me no joy.  Well let me just say, that my face hurt from smiling after taking this beautiful machine for a drive.

This car has options on it that never occurred to me.  Its computer monitors just about every system on board.  It tells you when fluid levels are low, tells you when you need to get an oil change (I know, I freaked when my car started politely asking me to change its oil).  It even politely asks you if you meant to leave on your turn signal.  A friend of mine once commented that the car does everything but cook you dinner.  I agree.

This is the best ride I've ever owned.  If GM would bring this model out of retirement I would grab one in an instant!

The only problem I ever had with the car was a minor electrical issue, which is understandable considering the complexity of this vehicles systems.  In fact, I would still own this car today, except for the fact that one of its previous owners somehow managed to crack the sub-frame.  I'm confident that if one avoids jumping curves, or otherwise off-roading with this car, you'll have years and years of enjoyment with it.

To wrap it up.  This is one high-speed, low-drag car.  My friends and I dubbed it 'The Stealth-Mobile' quite simply because you can't hear it coming, and it's one of the sleekest cars on the road.  If you enjoy reliability as well as beauty in your cars, then this is a top pick.<br><br>
