            I bought my  2000 cavalier  2 dr coupe in October of 1999.
I had considered this car and after looking at  what i got for the price
I knew  it was the one for  me.  It comes with front wheel drive, air conditioning and rear window defogger as part of the included features.
I just chose the basic package and after having it for a couple of months 
wish I would have went with some options.  It is great on gas mileage, as I drive 50 miles everyday for my work.  There isnt a whole lot of leg room for back seat passengers so consider  this if you have children.
It is a great car for a couple or a single person though.
It is a sporty looking car for little money.<br><br>
