            The Nissan Xterra is intentionally truck-like and grassroots basic, while giving you the ride and handling you desire for everyday motoring. In this day of &quot;car-based&quot; mini SUV's (Rav-4,Cr-V, Forester [hello, tall wagon??]) Its refreshing to see an SUV that does all the things they do well nicely and still be true to the SUV mission of off-road prowess and ruggedness. It is one of the best looking mini SUVs I feel and should hold up well as most Nissans do. It is lower priced than other mini Suv's partly due to the fact the platform already existed (Frontier) and it was already tooled at factory for UN vehicles. Test drive, read a few mags, think about it.  
The Xterra is a top-notch vehicle. I have researched SUV's and came up with the Nissan Xterra as my winner. Then again, so did Motor Trend. This vehicle is sporty looking and very functional. It is not loaded up with fancy bells and whistles. The only whistles the Xterra has is the ones I get driving down the road. 
Inside: lots of functional things, good sound system,cd,tape,am/fm 100wt, 6 speakers. Seats are comfortable and good lumbar support. It doesn't have Z28 Camaro power but does have plenty to stay above the posted speed limit on hills. Will tow 5,000lbs. and is really safe feeling off road. 
Quite simply the Xterra is the best SUV available. For the price of a Chevy Tracker you can buy a Nissan Xterra, not a midget SUV, a real life full size SUV built to be Road Hard and put away wet. The Xterra is comfortable, Capable and fun, its impressive looks and ease of handling make it an excellent, better yet, makes it the only SUV to buy. That is  unless you want a $30,000 luxury &quot;car&quot; that lacks both Sport and Utility in that case you are better spending the outrageous  money and buying an Explorer. The X is not for the faint of heart, it is a back to basic true blooded SUV for people who want sport and utility not a flashy car that proves how &quot;great&quot; they are. Take my word for it, the X is the only SUV to buy. <br><br>
