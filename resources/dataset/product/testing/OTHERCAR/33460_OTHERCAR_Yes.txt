            I absolutely love this camera.   

I very recently took several photos at my 2-year-old grandson's birthday party, and was very pleased with the results.  Great lighting, focus, and detail in the photos.  Nice to see the results on my computer just minutes after the party.  I have a 19" monitor, and the high resolution shots fill the monitor with a huge photo that is crisp and clean.  I wish my cheap color printer could give as good results as they show up on the monitor.  A better printer will be my next purchase, so I can show off these great pictures.

The D-520 is easy to point and shoot and usually gives great results with no effort.   The camera was passed around a bit, and my children also used it to take a few shots.  Some of the shots had the usual "chopped-off-subject" where they didn't frame the subject well.  The camera can't compensate for operator errors.  The images were all at least as good as what they usually show off from their point-and-shoot 35mm film cameras.

This is the first digital camera I have purchased.  I am not a digital camera expert.  I have used a few models of the Sony Mavica (with floppy disk media for recording the images) at work for the past several years.  I have used my Minolta Maxxum 7000 35mm film camera for many years.  The Maxxum is a Pro-Quality camera that takes great photos.  Which all means that I am very discerning when it comes to photo image quality.  I was surprised that this little digital camera could possibly deliver great images.  I am very pleased with the Olympus D-520.

The little 15 second movie clips that it can take are very poor quality.  The 320x240 pixel movie is just a novelty.

The "panorama" mode is a nice feature, once you get to know how to work it.  An area on each side must slightly overlap successive shots.  Then the software can stitch the shots into a very wide-angle shot.  I have a long house, and you can't back up far enough to get a photo of the entire house.  If you could back up far enough, it would be mostly sky and grass.  With the panorama mode, you stand in one spot and successively take shots along the house.  Then the software stitches the photos together automatically into one long photo of the house.  I tried it with limited success inside the house.  I took shots in the kitchen of each of the 3 walls, and stitched them together for a neat looking wide-angle.  This could be very interesting for real estate photos. 

I take all shots at the high resolution setting.  When I let the camera save the files on my computer hard drive, I also save the images at lower 640x480 resolution to e-mail them to family members.  Very handy.  Just plug the USB cable into the camera, and my Windows XP grabs the images in a few simple steps.

I purchased a 64mb memory card.  The original 16mb card holds 32 images of 1600x1200, the resolution I always use.  The 64mb card holds about 128 images.

I purchased rechargeable batteries for it, a must on all digital cameras.  Avoid using the 1.5" LCD monitor to extend the battery life.  

I purchased a small case for the camera.  Protects the camera, holds the extra memory card, and extra batteries.

The one complaint I have is the date & time.  It is great to have the photos identified by a date and time.  Unfortunately, each time you put in new batteries (which is very often) you must set the date and time all over again.  I wish they had some feature to retain the date and time setting between changing batteries.

I purchased the package together.  $299 for the camera with it's standard stuff like the 16mb card, plus a 64mb card, case, and a card reader that I don't bother to use.  After the initial purchase, I purchased 4 rechargeable AA batteries at K-Mart for $12.
