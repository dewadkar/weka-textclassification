            This is the best car I have ever owned.I bought for many reasons one being the safety aspect. The other is the excellent build quality. This car is a very solid car. It feels very strong and well built. The car feels very confident even in Inclement weather. 

The interior is cozy and spacious. The interior is very tasteful with good lighting and nice colors. There is an incredible amount of headroom in front,and adequate headroom in rear. The large,comfortable seats make for a comfortable ride. The interior is very quiet even at high speeds with minimal engine,tire,and wind noise.

 The ride is perfectly smooth and the large,grippy 16&quot; wheels make for crisp,confident handling. The 4-wheel disc ABS brakes (standard) bring the car to halt quickly and enables the car to be controllable during heavy braking. The instrument are well laid out with a large speedometer in center and tach/fuel on the sides. 

The indigo/red illumination is perfect for reading at dusk. The standard equipment list is long and full. This car is perfect for anyone who wants a well built, German engineered car. The car is safe and very well built. I have no complaints and plan to keep it until it dies and then I plan to buy another Beetle. This car is perfect. Buy it and you won't be disappointed. I have no complaints. <br><br>
