            OK...here are some givens. I love to take pictures (especially of my grand kids),I'm a true computer &quot;junkie&quot;, and I love to bore my family and friends senseless by sending them tons of pictures via the internet. Knowing that, my wife went out to buy me the best digital camera she could afford for Christmas, and she came home with the Kodak DC 280. Four months later, I'm just as pleased with it as I was the first day. The 280 is easy to use, the pictures look great, and the ability to create almost anything I want with the enclosed picture software is amazing. I already had a &quot;photo&quot; capable printer, so I was &quot;ready to rumble&quot;. Being your typical &quot;I don't need no stinking instructions&quot; kind of alpha male,I was shooting &quot;keepers&quot; after only a few moments of skimming through the instructions. 

There are some considerations, however. You end up storing a lot of large picture files on your computer hard drive, so you need some means of extra storage (i.e. zip drives, recordable CD's, etc.) Also, you need to have Windows 98 on your pentium computer to use the enclosed USB connection. I was using &quot;95 and had to get the upgrade so the camera could talk to my computer. You probably want to get an extra memory card with your camera. They aren't cheap, but they really come in handy. Finally, be sure to hang on to the old reliable 35mm. Having both the digital job and the old school unit will give you a lot of options. <br><br>
