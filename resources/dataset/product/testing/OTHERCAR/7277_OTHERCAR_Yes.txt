              I got started in digital photography last year with the purchase of a Polaroid PDC-640 (640 x 480 resolution).  After a short while I found this camera did not satisfy my needs 100%.  Mainly I wasnt completely satisfied with the quality of the photos because of the lower resolution.  I must admit I am somewhat of a resolution freak.  If a photo is grainy it simply bothers me.  
  So I recently decided to upgrade.  After conducting alot of research over the web, I opted for the <b>Olympus D-460 Zoom Digital Camera</b>.  I chose this camera over others because: 
        
         1.  It was within my $300 max price range.
         2.  It drew rave reviews for its photo quality.
         3.  It supported a serial port rather than a USB
             port (my outdated computer does not have a USB
             port!)
         4.  It had alot of nifty features for the price.
         5.  It has a 1280 x 960 resolution or 1.3 
             megapixel      
         6.  It has an optical zoom


  I decided to buy my camera off the web from a company called <b>eDigitalstop.com</b>.  I purchased my camera for $285 (free shipping).  By the way, I was extremely satisfied with their service.

  After removing the camera from the box I found it very easy to take a picture without reading the supplied instruction manual.  However, in order to utilize all the nifty features this camera has to offer, I found myself continually going back to the manual.  Now after owning this camera for two months I dont have to go back to manual as often.  <i>If you are the type of person that can program a vcr without a problem, than this shouldnt be an issue for you</i>!

  I am very pleased with the quality of photos this camera takes considering the cost of the camera.  Yes, there is some <b>minor</b> graininess in the photos even when taken in SHQ (super high quality) mode.  But, when I bought this camera I realized that it would not be perfect.  If money was not an option than I would have opted for a 3.0 or greater megapixel camera.  But unfortunatly, money was a major consideration.  <i>Remember though, I am quite picky when it comes to the quality of photos, so the average person probably would think the quality of the photos is great!  As a matter of fact, every one that has seen my photos taken with the Olympus D-460 comments on the great picture quality.</i>

Downloading the photos, using the supplied serial cable, onto my antique computer proves to be a slow process.  I suppose it would be nice if it was faster, but I guess it is not a big deal to me.  I realize I could buy a floppy disk adapter to speed things up, but hey that costs money!

Incidently, an AC adapter is <b>NOT</b> included with the camera.  I highly recommend you purchase one if you plan on using the serial cable to download your photos.  Without an AC adapter you will be forced to use your batteries which will be drained rather quickly.  I purchased an adapter for a very reasonable $19.99 + $6 shipping from <b>01dot.com</b>

Also, purchase 4 AA rechargeable NiMh batteries and a charger.  This is much cheaper in the long run, rather than buying alkaline or lithium batteries.  <i>Yes, at this point of my epinion, you all know I am a cheapskate!</i>
Note:  I have taken a 190 photos thus far with my camera and am still on the original lithium batteries supplied with camera!  This is attributed to the fact I do not use the LCD monitor very often and I use the AC adapter when downloading images to my computer.

  If you are a total resolution freak that demands the highest quality photos and $$ is not a problem than this probably isnt the camera for you.  For the average Joe, this camera is more than sufficient.  
  
********UPDATE.....May 8, 2001***********

My camera took a beating and died last week when I went up the mountain on my ATV.  I wrapped it up in a coat and stuck it in a duffel bag tied onto my rear rack (also had camera in a protective <i>soft case</i>.  Anyhow, the camera still was not protected enough from the jarring.  When I arrived at our destination, my camera was basically dead and in several pieces.  
  Unfortunately, the warranty did not cover the $108 in damages since it was my fault.
  Lesson:  Get a hard case for your digital camera and be more careful than I was!  These digital cameras are more sensitive to shock than a normal camera.
