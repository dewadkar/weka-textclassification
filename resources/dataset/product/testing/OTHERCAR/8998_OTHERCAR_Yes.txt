                  I recently had the opportunity to drive a <b>2000 fully-loaded Kia Sportage 4x4</b> for a significant period of time. It only had 18 miles on it when I got behind the wheel. I decided I wanted to try an SUV after I got tired of all the tiny sports cars where your practically sitting on the floor with your legs stretched straight out in front of you, a very uncomfortable driving position.  I must say I loved the Kia Sportage, though it did have several significant flaws that would make me think seriously before purchasing one.    
     

 It's a very sporty SUV, very nice.  I fell in love with the body style immediately. It's small, but not too small, and the axis is wide enough to provide a feeling of stability and security while turning.  It's classy, not cutesy.  The <b>interior</b> is very soft cloth and incredibly roomy. 4 average adults could fit comfortably with plenty of head and leg room. I'm 5'3 and had no problem fitting behind the wheel. The tilt wheel option and adjustable bucket seats provided a very comfortable driving position. Someone who is 6' would be just as comfortable. The back seat also unhooks and flips up easily to provide over 140 cubic feet of cargo room! 
      

<b>Manuverability</b> isn't bad at all.  It corners very nicely, with lots of control.  You don't feel as though you're about to tip over like you do in the Chevy Tracker.  The steering has a nice, solid feel, and the wheel felt very nice under my hands.  It responds immediately and without complaint or an attitude.  Braking is very impressive, very sensitive without being overly sensitive.  <b>The ride</b> was very smooth, an absolute joy. Some Kia owners complain of engine or road noise, but this one was absolutely silent except for a pleasant hum just to let you know you're on the road.  


      Some of the <b>controls</b> (radio and temp)are difficult to find while driving because they're so small and not clearly marked.  The radio dial looks amusingly fake, though the numbers are large.  The station dial is about as far from the driver as I've ever seen, but the sound system (optional AM/FM Cassette-CD Player) is <b>GREAT</b>.  Clear and loud. The sound envelops you.  I didn't like the silent two-second pause while changing radio stations, though.   
 

There are <b>a few problems</b> which make me hesitant about the Kia Sportage. The lack of fuel economy (19 to 23 mpg, with a possibility of only 16 mpg, depending on how hard you drive)is a big turn-off with gas prices these days, though it's common with SUV's. There are others that get better mileage than this one, though. 


      It's not a fast vehicle, either. <b>Acceleration</b> is practically non-existent in the 4-speed automatic due to the small engine (127 hp 4l)and the 2-door only has 96 hp. It's almost embarrassing as other cars speed away from a light and you're crawling away. I couldn't get it above 65 mph, and the engine was working hard. If you like speed and zippiness or do a lot of highway travel, you'll go after this one with a baseball bat before too long. <b>Visibility</b> is poor, also.  The spare tire blocks most of your view out the back window, making it difficult to back-up in tight situations.  The side view isn't much better, and forget about trying to see out the passenger side.  You are forced to depend almost entirely on your side mirrors for lane changes and backing up, which can be unnerving in high traffic.   


       Overall, it's a nice status-symbol vehicle for driving around town, off-roading, and turning a few heads.  It's not good for serious driving like cross-country highway trips, though it's comfortable enough.  Unless you're the mosey-ing type, you'll get tired of this one real fast. For a strictly recreational vehicle, though, this one is great fun to drive, and I would recommend it as a second car. <br><br>
