            When looking at the Subaru WRX, you are probably not looking at anythnig else in this price range.  The Impreza WRX is the only car in the United States that combines a turbo and all wheel drive for under $30,000.  Want turbo and all wheel drive in another sedan?  Next stop $31,000 for the sedate 1.8T Audi A4 Quattro.

American enthusiasts have been clamoring for the Subaru WRX since it was first introduced in the early 90's to the Japanese, Australian, and European markets.  The WRX finally arrived on US soil in early 2001 as a 2002 model and is availible in 4 door sedan and wagon body styles with a 5 speed manual transmission or a 4 speed automatic (for wussies).

The WRX is a blast to drive, it has great acceleration and power in all RPM ranges.  The 5 speed manual shifts extremly well, better than in any subaru I've ever driven.  The power of the turbo really gets away in away from you when on the highway, you think you are doing a safe, legal speed when you look down and see you are actually doing 85!

The all wheel drive system is not only good for snowy, wet roads, but also functions well keeping your shiny new WRX glued to the road.   

While the performance is excellent, the interior is lacking some room.  It is understandable that it would be beacause of the WRX's small physical size, but the room is below that of other cars its size such as the Honda Civic and Ford Focus.

The WRX does everyhting well, whether it be getting groceries on a tuesday evening or road racing at your favorite track sunday afternoon.
