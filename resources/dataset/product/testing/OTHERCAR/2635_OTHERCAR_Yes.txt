            Dear Financial Analyst,

After many trips back and forth over many tiring miles, would it be ok to buy something fun to drive? 

This was a dilemma, here before me was a 1992 Audi 100CS Quattro that was traded at the dealership where I worked. My daily beater was getting on in age and miles so I was looking to move up a bit.

Generally, I would not have considered this car because it was 8 years old and was quite technical, but I was offered the car for dealer cost and I had an extensive background in the repair and up-keep of these cars. Essentially it was a "no brainer".

The 100CS was replaced by the A6 in 1994 but the cars are nearly identical.

The car I purchased has a 5 speed gearbox, which slips smoothly into any gear.  Many cars offering a manual transmission can only be envious.  Audi was never big on automatic transmissions and for many years of the earlier Quattros a manual transmission  was the only offering.  If you drive both transmissions you will see that it make no sense to drive the automatic.

Power is generated by a 2.8 liter overhead cam 8 valve V-6 engine, which is essentially a V-8 with two fewer cylinders.  This engine has had its share of trouble but overall it serves the car well and properly cared for can be a very enduring friend.  Silky smooth, quiet, efficient, well engineered, are some of the adjectives that I can use to describe this engine.  This engine is known adversely for its weak valve seals and leaking head gaskets.  Audi has the corrected parts available and the repair is fairly routine.

If you do not have a good technician who can be a partner in this car with you I would not encourage you to purchase one.  To those that are fortunate enough to have an "in"  this is an outright superior vehicle when compared to other European luxury autos of age and price.  I say that knowing that a 1992 535i BMW would cost approximately $3000.00 more than this car yet no AWD and much lower fuel economy and potentially high cost of maintenance. (tires for sure)

The Interior is very comfortable and totally adjustable, heated leather with multiple settings for the seat heaters.  An easily read set of analog gauges with a useful trip computer, helps to keep the driver informed.  A very easy climate control system that functions well and does not always do the thinking for you.  (A pet peeve of mine, a climate control system that takes over as soon as the key is turned on)  This system is set by the driver to where you want it. Audio is the "WOWZA"  Bose system, which I can honestly say that I have never heard a factory system that equals the reproduction and clarity designed in this offering.
(keep an ample supply of ear plugs on-hand for passengers)  

On the road this car is fluid and agile and a great place to rehearse for choir.  Unquestionably, one of the best interiors with no noticeable squeaks, creaks or whistles.

May I caution that buying any older European luxury/sport automobiles requires considerable investigation.  A great deal on price can mean a great deal of heartache.  Take any car you would consider to an uninterested professional for a thorough investigation into the condition.

We live in a time where a $1000.00 repair is common and regarding the higher end vehicles that $1000.00 repair is a drop in the bucket.  For example a routine A/C condenser for an common everyday car may cost $180.00 while for a car like this more than double and then you add labor which is probably in excess of $80.00 per flat rate hour you will need to stay away if these repair costs scare you.

I love this car and for all the money in upkeep and repair  I will never get close to the $39,000 sticker price of this car when it was new.  So for a fraction of the cost anyone can enjoy the Audi experience.  

Find a good reputable source for service and do your homework.

Oh I am currently averaging 29.09 mpg in all around use.  Many of the Sport Ute owners will cry but on the highway I average 31.5 mpg. (calculated over 655 miles and six days of highway driving and only once over 100mph.):)

Just for those who want to know about upkeep,  I have replaced the front right strut insert $70.00 part and my labor 1.5 hours,  the belt tensioner $65.00, and so far 7 oil changes.  (5 quart system) My first Audi Quattro 4000 had over 278,000 miles on it when I sold it and everything still worked as designed.  Take care of it and you know the rest.

UPdate 4/03/01 Wow when will spring get here?
This car saves lives!  After a longer than usual winter and many thousands of miles since the last time I checked in here I am happy to report a deeper appreciation for the engineering of this automoible.  I can't tell you that the car has been flawless as I did buy a power steering pump, and a fuel pump over the winter.  The total cost of both items installed was in retail dollars aproximately $410.00

The power steering pump can be replaced in about 15 minutes and does not require an arsenal of special tools and the fuel pump can be replaced where ever the car dies with litle more than a screw driver, some clamps, and a big pair of water pump pliers.  So after a long hard day trying not to curse at the Volvo engineers it is a relief to get into a car that makes my life simple.  

If you buy an Audi 100CS an are careful to excercise some of the above mentioned precursers you can have a great car as well.
