             Unfortunately, I don't own this car. However, I just drove the Audi A8-L and I had to comment on it. In a word: WOW! 
 I've been considering a new car for several months now and had originally narrowed my selection down to the Lexus LS 400, Mercedes S-Class, and the BMW 740iL. However, after driving the Audi, I believe I have a new favorite.
 I really liked the comfort of the LS 400, but the ride was too "disconnected" from the road. It was almost like riding on a cloud. And, the rear seat space wasn't too impressive. As a matter of fact, it was very close to the cabin size of the GS 400.
 The BMW, however, was a bit in the opposite direction -- good feel on the road, but not the most comfortable. Actually, I couldn't move the driver seat far enough back in the 740iL...and I'm not that tall. The rear room, however, was very generous.
 As for Mercedes, I don't know what happened with their new design. Really, it was the look of the interior that I disliked the most. The outside isn't bad, but I think the previous S-Class body type was the best.
 Enter the A8-L...
 This car had the best of the Lexus LS 400 and the BMW 740iL. It had very comfortable seats, plenty of get-up-and-go (more HP than Lexus or BMW), cavernous back seat area, and very nice fit and finish. Actually, it had even more bells-and-whistles than the 740iL and at about the SAME price (or slightly less)! Overall, just a GREAT car!
