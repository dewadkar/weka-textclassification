            In February 1999, my husband &amp; I purchased a 1994 Chevy 3/4 Ton 6.5 liter diesel four wheel drive extended cab. I really love the Chevy's interior. Very comfortable and roomy. Even the back seat is comfortable too. The Driver's seat is very comfortable. In fact so comfortable, you could get a little too comfortable. 

The only trouble we have had with this truck is that the Service Engine light comes on for no apparent reason. We disconnected the battery a couple of times and we have never had a bit of problem with the light coming on. It is not recommended by the garage's because when the truck is plugged into the diagnostic computer, unplugging the computer will lose information on what may be wrong with the trucks systems. 

The transmission in this truck is an automatic with overdrive. I love the transmission for local commuting and long distance traveling. I have also used this truck to pull my four horse gooseneck trailer locally. It is okay on the flat (freeway, country roads, etc). I would not recommend this truck pulling a trailer in the hills or over mountains with the transmission. I felt leaving this truck in drive while pulling a trailer empty was &quot;tacking&quot; a little high at freeway speed (55 MPH). RPMs were about 2800, so I would put the transmission into overdrive. 

I would recommend this truck (with auto transmission) for someone who hauls a horse or two on the flats and hauls some hay. I would not recommend this truck for someone who plans on going into the hills, unless they got a manual transmission. Overall comfort is a 10. The mileage without a trailer is 16-17 mpg and with a trailer about 10 to 11 mpg. This truck as it is would be great for towing around the ranch pulling fuel wagons and some small farm implements. Any heavier towing, I would recomend a manual transmission.
