            If you look around you'll notice quite a lot of mid 80's Honda Civic's like this one on the road. They seem to have longevity! It's a good little car that has been very reliable for me, especially considering the year! Mine is maroon, has over 215000 miles, automatic transmission and is a 4dr sedan. It cost me $1200 and we're glad to have it. This is a good low priced car to get you around town. I mean of course you'll be repairing any car that isn't relatively new, but this one is a winner! Mine doesn't have any power, no AC.. but the interior is in excellent shape. I'm telling you this part now because Epinions says to write MORE!! The tape deck is broken in mine :( but it's a factory deck, it's pretty old now!! The radio works fine though. It heats up nice. No power steering so there is quite the wheel cranking which is not good if your muscles are sore (like when you're sick) I wouldn't recommend any car without power steering to a frail person.
