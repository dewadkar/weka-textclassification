            The Fuji Finepix 2600 made it's debut approximately half a year ago and has proven to be a very very popular digital camera.  The main reason being the exceptional value that the Finepix 2600 package offers.  The camera includes, 2AA rechargeable NiMH batteries, a 16MB Smartmedia card (vs 8mb which is the standard amount of memory in the 2.0 megapixel range), as well as all the necessary software and the USB cable to connect the camera to any relatively modern computer.

Although not one of the digital cameras I have owned, I am writing this review based on my experiences using it at work, as well as customer feedback I have received over the past few months.  Here is a quick overview of the 2600...

The Finepix 2600, the successor to the Finepix 2400 has had a few minor improvements and changes, I will break down the review into a few different sections to outline the changes as well as review my (as well as others) impressions of the camera.

<b> Body and LCD display </b>
As most people already know, the Finepix 2600 was the natural evolution of it's predecessor the Finepix 2400.  Fuji redesigned the body packaging the camera in a much smaller body while reducing the power requirements while maintaining 3x optical zoom as well as a simple and intuitive control layout. The camera is extremely easy to hold and use with the shutter button being put in a convenient location.  The sliding cover is also very easy to slide open and lock into the place with a simple motion whereas the Fuji Finepix 2400 one could not simply just slide the cover open without taking your eye off of the viewfinder.

A common complaint about the 2400 though was the sliding door to cover the lens (which automatically retracts when shut off).  Although the additional protection for the lens is nice, many felt that this part (which would be subject to much mechanical movement) would potentially break or fall off over time.  I can honestly say that no Fuji cameras have come back to the store for any work on the sliding cover.  Although I personally agree with people that it is not the best design, the sliding cover has proven to be quite rugged.  

The viewfinder still remains pretty useless, as when one is zooming in using the optical zoom, the viewfinder is not much of a high eyepoint viewfinder. 

The LCD display on the Fuji 2400 is your standard basic LCD display.  When compared to other cameras at this price point, the Fuji LCD displays are not as sharp as other brands and are extremely hard to view in bright light.  Granted, that in order for one to expect anti-glare coatings on their LCD screens they are looking at high end two megapixel cameras, I think that Fuji should have at least improved the resolution of the display as when reviewing your pictures it is a lot more difficult to determine just how well your shot turned out.  The money that could have been saved by excluding the viewfinder (albeit how little it may have been) should have been invested towards a better quality LCD display.

<b> Picture Quality </b>
Like most two megapixel cameras, one can expect a decent quality 4x6 picture with adequate 5x7 prints.  Although some people claim that they get photo quality 8x10's from 2.0 megapixel cameras, I fail to see where and how they are getting their results.  8x10's from digital cameras have much more jagged edges then their film quality counterparts.

In terms of colors reproduction the CCD's in the lower end Fuji cameras do not seem to reproduce colors as well as some other brands.  Don't get me wrong here, the Finepix 4800, and 6800, as well as their other higher end digital cameras take absolutely amazing pictures and are definitely among my favorites in their respective classes and price ranges.  From photos that I have seen from the Fuji 2400, colors were produced accurately but they did not seem as sharp as they should be.  This is likely due to the lens quality of the camera.  In my opinion, the best camera for sharp pictures at this particular price point would be the Canon A20, or perhaps the Sony P30 (go a little higher in price and you are looking at the S110, or S300).  All in all, acceptable quality pictures, but not the best that one can get.  Like most cameras, the ones that generally perform better are the ones that have lenses that are actually made by companies with the expertise in producing top quality optical glass.

<b> Battery Life </b>
Just a short note, I recall reading in another review that the Fuji manual stated that one can get over 300 shots on the included set of NiMH batteries.  I completely disagree with this statement as there is no digital camera out there that runs on AA batteries that comes even close to this number, let alone on 2AA batteries.  With the LCD display on (which seems pretty much a must) I think that the most one could expect out of that set of batteries is just over a 100 shots.  Part of the reason being that the LCD display (which does not appear to run at as a high resolution as cameras such as the S110, or the S300) would be a little easier on the batteries.  If you do decide to opt for this camera I would strongly recommend buying another set of NiMH rechargeables.

<b> Conclusion </b>
Should you get this camera ? In my opinion the Finepix 2600 definitely offers the best "bang for your buck" and for the average consumer who is just getting into the digital is an excellent first choice for a digital camera.  If one can afford it, I would recommend moving up to a Canon S110, or S300 (some others worth looking at would be the Nikon Coolpix 775, or the Olympus D-510) because of the more durable body size as well as the included rechargeable lithium ion battery.  But despite the few shortcomings that I have discussed about the camera, the Finepix 2600 is an excellent value for your money and will be amply enjoyed by the general entry-level digital photographer.  Though, if the Finepix 2600 is anything more then a digital camera on the side, I would recommend taking a good look at some of the similar 2.0 megapixel cameras out there.
