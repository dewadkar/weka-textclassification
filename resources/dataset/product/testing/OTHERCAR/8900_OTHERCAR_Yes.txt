            This mid priced roadster is worth every penny. The manual 5 speed transmition gives the Z3 a sporty racing feel, while the handling is precise and crisp. The transmition is anything but spasmodic. Where as other roadsters tend to be lose. The manual top is light weight and easy to open and close. The only fall back is for the Northeastern marcket. The Z3 is not practicle for the winter months and the tires tend to lose air in extreme cold. If you live in the south the Z3 is a must have, for the north, I say put it in the garage because when spring comes around it'll be a blast. The plush interior is comfortable but there is only room for two. The sound system is incredible and the spedometer and other gauges integrate the sleek exterior to the interior. I bought a white with a tan top and it drived beatifully. The Z3 is a steal over the Benz SLK because the cars are comperable and the Benz has an astronomical price tag. The Z3 moderately priced is a sure thing.<br><br>
