            We shopped and shopped for a low-mileage used minivan.  We test drove the Pontiac Montana, Honda Odyssey, and the standard Grand Caravan. We had just decided to buy the Montana when I spied the Sport AWD Grand Caravan across the lot (sales lot of a certain yellow rental car agency). Here is how we compared the above vans:

<i>Pontiac Montana:</i>  Great power (3.4L V6) and a nice ride (somewhat better even than what we purchased).  Somewhat less roomy than the others below.  The seats were VERY comfortable and plush.  The captain's chairs were easy to get around and push forward.  We decided against this for the power and look-  not too excited about the boxy look. It has the signature Pontiac "big buttons" and red fighter-jet like instrument lights.

<i>Honda Odyssey:</i> Great van. Much roomier inside than any we drove. I think it has a 3.5L that was up with the competition. The captains chairs can go from separate to bench with a bit of grunting (not something you'll want to do every day).  With the seats in the bench configuration, it's a tight squeeze to the back seat.  Loads of cargo space with the "well" in back. Not impressed with the instrument cluster and controls. Doesn't look like Honda spent a whole lot of time on this.  Rides low to the ground. Drives like a sedan instead of a van (we like sitting up high!).  Not worth all the extra $$ in my opinion.  For the price of our 14K miles 2003 Caravan we could only find a 2001 50K+ mile Honda!

The <b>Grand Caravan Sport AWD</b> that we found has the 3.8L V6 that out performs all the others (much much better than the standard 3.3L Caravans).  It shifts smoothly and really gets going (haven't tried it with a full load yet).  The AWD sold us (haven't experienced that yet either).  It's quiet, smooth and feels very roomy inside.  We have the power right side sliding door and power liftgate!  What a neat option! Hit the button on the key fob and beep, beep, beep, up comes the back hatch. Great for walking up to the car with cart full of kids and groceries!  We really liked the look of this van over the others (didn't even consider the Venture or Winstar based on looks alone). There's plenty of cargo space.  Enough room for our DUO Glide double stroller to lay down flat with room to spare (couldn't do that in our old Villager). The Sport model has the trip computer, compass, and outside temp. I programmed the garage door opener in just a few minutes. There's this neat little green light that comes out of the center overhead console great for reading directions or seeing a phone number at night.  We would have preferred the one-piece bench seat in the very back. The split seat is very uncomfortable for the poor soul stuck in the middle.

All in all, we are VERY please with this vehicle and look forward to many years of faithful service!
