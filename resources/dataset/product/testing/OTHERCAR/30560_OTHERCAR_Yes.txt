            I purchased this vehicle 3 weeks ago and must say it has, and will continue to be a pleasure to drive.  Though I had researched and had been very interested in the Pilot since its roll-out...  I had planned to keep a '97 Honda Passport and invest in a 'car.'  My decision came down to: BMW 330, Audi A6, Lexus ES300, and the Pilot.  As you can tell, I chose the Pilot...  EX-L with the Navigation System to be specific.  I couldn't get away from the fact that for less than the price of the afore mentioned vehicles...  I could get a loaded vehicle with wonderful reviews, safety recommendations, Honda reliability and LOTS of room.   

Honda does well in the ergonomic department...  All controls are easily accessible.  The ride is not as quiet as the Lexus, but it wasn't meant to be a luxury vehicle.  The interior is very pleasant...  the body is plain, yet attractive.

I wish the steering wheel controls and a couple others were illuminated.  How hard could it have been to at least light up the cruise controls?  I would have traded nearly all of the cupholders and AC outlets for some lit up audio and cruise.  

The only 'extras' I purchased from the dealer were a pair of rear mud guards.  I think it was pretty silly to include front guards but not the rear.  Just a little irritation that could have been avoided by bouncing up the base price instead of asking me for an additional $80 (installed).   They could have done the same for the roof rack cross-bars (haven't purchased them yet).

Enough b----ing.  I truly enjoy this vehicle and would recommend it to anyone and everyone in the market for a mid-size SUV.  Honda has proven to me over the years that their vehicles are extremely reliable, comfortable, and well built.  

Only after market accessories I purchased:  Clear Bra, and a cargo tray.

One last thing...  I've read many reviews where people describe the seats as 'painful' and uncomfortable.  I could not disagree more.  I'll take riding in my Pilot for 12 hours over sitting in an airplane for 12 hours any day!
