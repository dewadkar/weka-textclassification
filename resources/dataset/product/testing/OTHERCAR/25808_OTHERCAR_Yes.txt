            I finally had to get a bigger vehicle, because my children are getting bigger.  I debated for awhile on the type of vehicle to get.   If I have to get a van, then I wanted to stay in my car family, which was a Mercury Sable.  At first, I did not want to get a van, because I feel that vans are big, and I usually have a hard time getting into parking spaces with them.  When I finally started looking at vans, I fell in love with the Quest.  I liked the size of the van, and the inside was nice.  The Quest van was not in my price range, so I decided to check out the Villager.  I realized, while I was looking at the Mercury Villager's I noticed that it was the same exact van as a Quest.

What made me decide to buy my 96 Mercury Villager, was that is was roomy, which means the children will be very comfortable.  I also like the feature of the Rear A/C, and audio/fan controls.  The ride is smooth, and it feels like a car.  What I like about my van is the fact that the middle and the back seats come out, and they also fold down.  What I really feel comfortable about my choice in vans is the fact that it is small enough to see over the hood, and I can back into parking spots, with no problem. 

If your are looking far a van, that is roomy, looks sporty, and drives nice, then look no further than a Villager.<br><br>
