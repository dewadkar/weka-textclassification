            This convertible M3 is nothing short then amazing.
Let me say this. 
I hate to say its a practical car, because it isn't.  (Can't be practical at $60k plus)  But if you want the most practical sports convertible car in this range, this is it.

Lets start of with the attributes of this beast:

1. Engine:  333 horsepower.  3.2 Liter.  6 cylinder.  0-60 5.4 sec (coupe 4.8 sec)  Top Speed 154mph.

2. Wheels/Rims:  18" Standard, 19" Option(1700.00), Light Cast Alloy.  
Tire Pressure monitor keeps track of all four tires.  Tires are runflats.  Can run on tires at 50mph up to 80 miles.

3. Transmission:  Manual or SMG option ($2400.00).  A manual driver myself, I am glad I got the SMG (Sequential Manual Gearbox) option.  
Its not tiptronic, steptronic, auto/manuals.  This SMG is a clutchless manual shifting with the option of an automatic shifting.  When placed in Automode, drives like someone is shifting for you.  Can adjust the shifting response from smooth to aggressive.  Try it.  You'll like it.

4. Fuel:  16mpg city, 23mpg freeway,  Premium Unleaded Fuel Grade

5. Body:  The styling of the M3 coupe/convertible has evolved from the boxy shapes from the 80s/90s to what we see today.  Every angle, every curve of the body fuses beauty and function together.

6. Seats.  Power Leather seats are comfortable.  3 setting memory (no one drives this car but me but its nice to have it)  I am 5'10" and I have sat in many sports cars (test driving them).  Ride is exceptionally great for a sports car.  All things considered, a smooth ride for a sport class vehicle.

The only problem I have is having friends get in the back seats.  I have to move up my seat (so they have leg space) which makes me a bit uncomfortable.  It's not too much trouble since I drive it alone most of the time.

7  GPS system:  It is DVD-based starting Nov 2002.  It is very useful and better then prior years cd-rom based GPS.
DVD of addresses included.  Can plot any destination throughout the continental USA.

8. Convertible:  One button press.  Fully automatic.  Do not need to unlatch anything.  Can put down or up the convertible with the door key for convenience.  The Ultimate Tanning Machine.  Enjoy the ride and the sun.  Nothing quite like this.  Open air ride with power.  Incredible.

Well, this review has made me want to go for a ride to ......anywhere. :)


FOUR MONTHS later.....

and 4200 miles.  Driving this car is a joy.  Have not had any problems with it.  SMG transmission grows on you.  Ability to switch to auto clutch in traffic is convenient.
Lowering the convertible on beautiful days is priceless.
