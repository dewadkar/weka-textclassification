            When I walked into COMP USA and proceeded to examine their selection of digital cameras, the salesman immediately directed me over to the $500 ones with 5.0 megapixels.  When I told him my budget and the extent of my usage, he told me about the Olympus D-380 and how much of a bargain it was for the quality.  Avoiding the Hewlett Packards, Canons, and Sonys, I spent the $179 for the camera and added on the 64 MB memory card, as well as the Maxell NiMH NiCd battery charger. 

The camera itself takes 4 AA batteries and believe me, you will want to be able to recharge at your leisure.  This small camera, like all digital cameras, eats up batteries quickly and you don't want to be stuck fighting a blinking light while you're trying to take quality pics.

The resolution on the standard quality of 1024x768 allows for a reasonable sized file with film quality.  The 2.0 megapixels might be outdated but for the money you spend, you are gaining enough to start with.  There are multiple features which allow one to change red-eye, auto-zoom manually, and set a timer.  The 1.5" LCD screen allows one to preview pictures accurately and quickly as well as line up big shots without squinting into the viewing window.

With the ability to delete and change resolution while the camera is not in shooting mode, editing before transferring the files to the computer is as easy as ever. The LCD screen has easy to follow directions with clear pictures if you are afraid you will become confused.  

As a bonus, a CAMEDIA CD-ROM is included with the camera, as well as the quality USB cable and 8MB memory card (which I recommended not using and buying a larger one).  The camera has a movie feature for taking 15 or 60 second MPEG files but requires good lighting.  Like all cameras, the D-380 has a limited flash range under ten feet, but adjusts for poor or bright lighting effectively with options for flash "on" or "off."  

The D-380 is light on your hands (fits nicely into optional carrying case) and your wallet, so if in doubt, go with a reliable camera brand.  Perfect for anyone starting out with digital cameras to college students embracing technology to avid photographers.  It's the camera I trust for everything including but not limited to pictures at parties, sports games, and formal events.
