            I have owned my Mercury Cougar XR7 for over a year now and the car has been everything I've needed it to be.  For an 8 year old car, I could not be more happy with any vehicle I've ever known. Performance, price, and durability all considered it is a smart buy.

My father bought the vehicle that I now own in 1992 to replace a Mustang he loved dearly.  As nice is his '86 Mustang was, he kept mentioning to me that the Cougar actually drew more compliments.  Though a little larger than most stylish cars of the 90s, when washed, this 2-door looks very sharp.  It might not often be mistaken for a sports car, but it appears to have class and reflects a sleeker image than that of all others in its class.

The vehicle I am driving has had no more than $800 put in it other than standard tune-ups, oil changes, and regular maintenance common on all vehicles.  That figure is astounding to me for an 8 year old car.  I have seen what most cars go through a couple years after the manufacturer's warranty runs out and I am more than grateful to have any of that first-hand.  This should mean a lot to used car buyers because a Cougar that has been taken care of well should not cost much in the way of typical used car fees, outside the initial price. 

The V6 engine requires a little push to get going, but has a lot of power should you need it.  You have to step on the gas to get acceleration out of it, but the engine runs very smooth at both low and high speeds - going 90 feels about like the speed limit should.  I have a manual transmission and have not had any problems with it.  The steering is both receptive and smooth, as any vehicle dubbed a luxury car should be.  Working under the hood is about average.  Some things are in places easy to get to, but it would not have hurt to put the oil filter in a better (cleaner) spot.

The car does not disappoint on the inside either.  The AM/FM-cassette player works like normal from the early nineties (before CD was common) and the speakers provide a good range of frequencies to fit each listener.  The engine purrs quietly, providing a quiet drive, should you not choose to use the sound system.  The gauges are very straight-forward, nothing fancy.  The driver's seat has numerous options for specific comfort and enough room is provided in the back to easily fit two - I've even taken a group of five men (three in back) on a four hundred mile trip without complaint.  

New Cougars have a sticker of around $17,000, and pre-owned 1993 models will run around $3,000 depending on how well it has been taken care of.  Future repair costs should be held to a minimum and gas mileage is as can be expected; mine gets around 25H/19C.  

The Cougar model has undergone some major changes from Mercury over the last couple years.  But, that should not prevent any potential buyers from taking a test drive of this 1993 model.  With future costs held in check and a smooth performance guaranteed, the unknown factors are as low as anyone could hope when buying a used car.  I would recommend this to all buyers, in particular to individuals not looking to put much work into it, like teenagers.  <br><br>
