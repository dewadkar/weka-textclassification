            My wife drove a Volkswagen Rabbit (diesel) for fifteen years before I was able to talk her into looking for a new car.  She was so pleased with her fifteen year experience I could hardly get her to look at another make of car.  When we did go to an other than Volkswagen dealer she kept comparing the new cars to her old Rabbit and ended up turning them all down.  When we went to the Volkswagen dealer that sold us the original car and drove all the models available it didn't take us long to settle on a 3-door Golf with a six cylinder engine.  It is called a VR6.  The car came with standard equipment including ABS brakes, AC, power steering, fuel injection, leather seats, am-fm stereo and a five speed transmission.  The only option available was a CD player which we turned down. The car is now four years old and we are just as pleased with it today as we were the day we picked it up.  It is a very quick little car that is easy and fun to drive.  It is a perfect size for local driving, has convenient and good storage space and is comfortable on long trips.  <br><br>
