            The 2000 Nissan Altima GXE was my second lease car after 3 years with a 1997 Nissan Sentra GXE.  I choose the Altima mainly because it had a very attactive lease rate ($220.00/mo, Zero out of pocket) and suited my overall needs (4 door sedan).  

The styling on the 2000 Altima is Good if not a little bit bland.  It looks much better if you have a spoiler and some nice wheels.  The interior design is nice: good simple guages, nice dash with tasteful wood trim, good cup holders, decent cd player, and controls that are easy to reach and use.  The driver seat has a height adjustment but could use lumbar support and some more padding (although much better than the Sentra).  I opted for the 5-Speed even though the clutch travel is very long and the trans has a long and not so smooth throw.  I can't complain to much because I'm sure that is sold mainly (98%) as an automatic.  

The acceleration is decent although you must replace the crappy General tires that come standard if you want to have any kind of traction.  The handling is also sufficient as are the brakes (although ABS would have been a nice addition).

The quality of the Altima seems Very Good.  I have had only one minor problem after 1 year/15,000 miles - a rear door molding that keeps coming off (its not even glued down).  

Overall the Altima is a great lease deal, much cheaper than the Accord, Camrey, or Jetta.

If you are buying than the above mentioned cars would be a better choice, with the Jetta being the best bet for you 5-speed drivers.<br><br>
