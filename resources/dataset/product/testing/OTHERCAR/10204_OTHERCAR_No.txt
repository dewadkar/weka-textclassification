            This vehicle is the biggest headache that I have ever purchased.  

I am a college student and need things to be inexpensive, and fortunatly when I went to by a vehicle the Suzuki Swift was priced very low.  

I thought that living in a place such as Arizona with very little mountains (that I would have to climb) this would be a great car. I WAS WRONG.

I have had the radio replaced two times because it would turn off and on by itself. The pinch weld in the fenders of my car keep comming loose (SCARRY!!) and I have had them re-welded.  My car would not start several times because of the switch in my gears didn't know that I was in park.  I have been in the shop for a mystery snapping sound originating from the rear of my car which they have still yet to fix, and Suzuki has finnally blamed on me because they do not know the origin of the sound and It is becoming very expensive to pay someone to not know what it is. MY CAR IS A LEMON.  

The only good thing about the car is that it actually runs the bad thing about it is that it is a 1998 with only 14000 miles and it has ALL of these problems.  

If you don't mind only being able to drive your car half of the time you own it, and with Suzuki's warrenty not be able to have a complementry rental car even if the repair will take longer then a day; Please by all means BUY this car. I feel the sooner I can sell this car the better and I suggest &quot;DO NOT PURCHASE A SUZUKI SWIFT.&quot;

Another quick note that I just found out while doing regular matinance on the car (TUNE UP)  THIS CAR HAS NO GAS FILTER, none of the newer models do.  WHY!!!!  I don't know but the machanic said that I should only keep this car for another couple of years because eventually they will have to replace some parts and that will be pricey so again I suggest &quot;DO NOT PURCHASE A SUZUKI SWIFT&quot;
