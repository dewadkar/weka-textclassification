            I'm currently in the market for a mini-SUV and the Freelander was on my short list of cars.  I've read all of the reviews on this site (both negative and positive), about the Freelander, however, I insisted on doing my own research.

So, my wife and I went to our local Land Rover dealership and test drove the Freelander today.  I've been looking forward to this day for a while due to the fact that I've read so much about the Freelander.  

First, I was very impressed with the overall feel of this small SUV. My wife and I felt very safe.  It had a heavy truck like feel.  Secondly, I wasn't too impressed with the engine nor the cooling power of the A/C.  I live in Miami and today was a real scorcher.  The A/C made a lot of noise but failed to cool the vehicle during our extended test drive.  Ditto with the engine.  It definitely needs more h/p.  We had three adults and the lack of horsepower became very noticeable from dead stops.  I currently drive a 4-cyl Infiniti G20, so I know what lack of power is!

I also didn't care for the placement of some of the buttons.  It seems like Land Rover didn't make an effort to relocate any of them when they changed the steering wheel from the right side (U.K.) to the left (U.S.).  An example is the button to open the sunroof, it's by the passenger's legs.  The perfect spot if the steering wheel were on the right....very awkward!

Also, no one-touch down or up feature on any of the power windows; no center arm rest; no auto climate A/C.  I think these are features that should be standard on a $30K+ vehicle.

Anyway, I think I'll wait till next year and see what happens.  Hopefully by then the Freelander will much closer to my drive way.
