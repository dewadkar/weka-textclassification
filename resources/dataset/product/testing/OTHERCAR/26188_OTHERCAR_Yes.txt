            The 2001 Volkswagen Passat is a highly rated car. Lots of people love it. 

I didn't. 

It's not a bad car by any means. In fact it's quite nice. But the car is not for me, and here's why.

<b> The growl of the engine turned me off.</b> The 2001 Passat delivers a nice quiet ride for the most part. But, it does have a growling engine during acceleration. I imagine that many of the drivers that VW wants really like this "attitude". But I didn't care for it. I like nice quiet cars.

<b> The funky styling felt too trendy and faddish. </b> Maybe I'm just getting old, or maybe it's that German design. The Passat that I test drove had a sleek black dashboard with circular gauges. With the lights on, these lit up in a neon-like blue and red. Maybe it's that my current car is a 7 year old Plymouth Neon and I've had enough cute. The lights felt trendy, cute. But I want classy, elegant, maybe a touch of sportiness. Also, the body style of the Passat also reminds me of my Neon. Not a good association, huh?

<b> It was expensive. </b> The Passat is a nice car, well-built, nice materials, good fit and finish, but the car is priced high. You can get a well-equipped (yawn) Camry or Accord for much less, and those cars have proven reliability, whereas VW's is more likely hit-or-miss. 

Let me say again that the Passat isn't a bad car. I just found it to be too loud, too youthful/sporty/faddish, and too expensive for me. 

Here are some of the positives that I found during the test drive:

<b> The car is roomier than it appears. </b> From the outside, the Passat doesn't look all that big. That's the illusion. The interior of the car is really rather roomy. The headroom in the back seat is generous (good for people who would be using a car seat, or have lots of tall riders). Trunk space, head room, and legroom are all quite good.

<b> The Passat has a good overall ride. </b> I'm big into smooth riding, quiet cars. Except for the aforementioned engine growl, the Passat had good handling and a good ride. I could easily get comfortable driving the car regularly, except for the "muscle" noise.

<b> Nice amenities and options. </b> The Passat is available with all the accessories you would like, including sunroof, leather seats, CD changer, etc. etc. One of the unique versions of the Passat is the 4-motion edition, which is an all-wheel drive car (especially good for snowy weather). While a regular Passat can be had in the mid-twenties, the AWD version starts around $30k.

<b> Other notes. </b> There are currently two versions of the Passat. The "regular" Passat, and the "new" Passat. Check out www.volkswagen.com for more details. The main style difference between the two cars is that the "New" Passat has chrome trim pieces that run along the sides of the car, adding a bit of class to the exterior, and making the "new" Passats a little less Neon-like.

The model that I test drove was the 4-cylinder GLS, with cloth seats, moonroof, and ABS. The car that I ended up buying was an 2001 Acura 3.2 TL. (took delivery yesterday, separate review to come in May/June). 

I would recommend the Passat to twenty-somethings who make enough cash to buy it, and to thirty-somethings and beyond who want to feel like hip twenty-somethings just a little longer. 

While not the car for me, the Passat might be just the car for you. Why not take a test drive and find out?
