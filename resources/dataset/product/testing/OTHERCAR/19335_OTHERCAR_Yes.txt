            Truly the most durable, driveable, comfortable 4 x 4 I've ever driven.

My previous cars were varied - but they were &quot;cars.&quot; After many Hondas, Nissans, Toyotas, and a few american cars, I finally decided I wanted something a little bigger for the cross-country travel I was planning to do. Of course there are many options now as one enters the world of SUVs. Almost every automobile manufacturer has an offering in this market.

I test-drove the offerings by Nissan, Toyota, Lexus and was unimpressed. These were basically big cars - outfitted for the urban jungle, yes - but clearly not made for the long-haul that a 4 x 4 should.

Driving the LandRover Discovery, I knew I was in for a different experience. From a distance, you can see that the engineering is just different. The main implements needed for a true 4 x 4: the suspension, framework, engine, and inner-plumbing is clearly appropriate for the tasks Land Rover assumes you'll be attacking.

Compared to other 4x4s, I found the Discovery incredibly solid. Driving it at top highway speeds, I felt available power at all times thanks to the superb 4.0 litre engine that was especially re-tooled in the 1998 - giving you ample power necessary for passing that many other SUVs don't have.

Other niceties like turning radius, interior seating, air conditioning, stereo, etc. were all wonderful as well.

The real test was my first off-road experience down in Big Sur when I was invited a birthday party at a friend's home where we were asked to meet at the &quot;bottom&quot; and then go up on an ATV cycle. I opted for testing my new Discovery. With a trail to navigate (read *trail* not road), I easily lumbered up the mountain easily in the Discovery. At points, I paused to survey the trail - a bit fearful at first, but finding the Discovery would easily take the most gruesome ditches and pits in the road. Finally, upon reaching the top, the gang met me there and exclaimed, &quot;hey, nice rig!&quot;

Before buying the 98 Discovery, I read all of the consumer reports reviews, etc... but there really wasn't much data available. Friends that bought Discoveries in the past had problems, but commented that they'd also heard that many of the issues with smaller engines in previous models, engineering issues, etc. had all been worked out in the 97 and 98.  I've owned it now for about a year - and haven't had a single issue with the performance. Still runs perfectly and still love it.
