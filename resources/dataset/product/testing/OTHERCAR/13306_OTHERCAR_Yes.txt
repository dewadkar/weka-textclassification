            I test drove this car for quite some time and almost bought it,but for a change in plans.I'm still thinking about buying it(it's not going anywhere,which american still knows how to drive a stickshift?).If I do,I'll offer the guy only $7000 (average cost to the dealer:$6200).

I'm 6' 4&quot;-I fit in very few compact/family cars.I sat in a '97 stratus in the base version(no options whatsoever,other than what the factory installed on all these cars.),with the 5 speed transmission.I actually fit in it-albeit had to recline the seat angle some to get a little mroe head room(head touched roof liner in the fully forward seat angle position.
Drives nice,the 4 cylinder 2Liter engine had enouph power for me(same engine as the base model Dodge Neon),of course the manual transmssion doesn't rob power like any automatic transmission would.

Nice interior layout,easy to read displays ,easy to use controls.Back seat only suitable for kids 11 and under.Trunk cavernous-back seats fold down.

No rattles detected,though engine noise evident ,surprising for a car so well laid out in every other area.Maybe the fact that this was a 4 cyl. VS a V6 accounts for that.

Even though the car was a base version A/c,stereo radio/cassette player,interior trunk release latch come standard.

This is a member of the Chrysler&quot;cloud car&quot; family,which include also,the Chrysler Cirrus,and Plymouth Breeze.All have identical interiors and body shapes-the differences evident in the front and rear grill/tail designs.The 5 speed base model is unavailable in the Chrysler Cirrus.

Interior noise has been improved since some modifications beginning with the '98 models.

This particular model has had two recalls: one minor and one a little more serious.There exists a &quot;hidden&quot; warranty on the 2.0 engines-service bulletins show evidence of the problems.If one should develop oil leaks and/or head gasket problems,a trip to the local Chrysler/Dodge/Plymouth dealer is in order and a hard talk with the service manager may be indicated(he already knows of such problems,don't let him bluff you).Chysler Corporation will re-imburse dealers for such repairs. 

I might just buy this car...if the price is right.<br><br>
