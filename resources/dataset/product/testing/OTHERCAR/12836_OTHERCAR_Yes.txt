            My lease was coming to a close on my last vehicle (a pick-up, 4x4) and I needed to find something to buy.  Most large SUV's were too big, and more than I wanted to spend; but I didn't want a car.  At work one day, I happened to see a new black RAV4 in the parking lot.  I was intrigued, and I told my husband I wanted one.  We already have a Camry, so we knew that Toyota makes good vehicles.  So, off to the Toyota dealership we went.

We test drove a 2002, silver RAV4 (2x4) at the dealership.  We actually wanted a 4x4, but they did not have one there, as we live in Oklahoma and the need for 4x4's isn't that great.  I really liked the drive and the look of the RAV4, and my husband (who is 6'5) had no problems sitting in or driving it.  We had the dealer price 4x4's, but the prices were just a little too steep for us at that time.  So, we decided to talk about 2x4's again, as we really didn't need a 4x4.  The silver one that we test drove was fully loaded, L-package, with a sunroof, and a security system.  We thought that we would be able to bargain a bit since it was on their lot already.  After negotiations, the dealer brought the price down quite a bit (approx. $2000, I can't remember exact numbers), and we had our new RAV4!

Our only problems have been actually quite small, but bothersome anyway.  There is (at times) a rattle somewhere by the glove box that they cannot seem to fix.  We have brought it in 5 times, and each time the rattle goes away for a couple of days, then it is back again.  The service team has been great though, and the repair is under warranty.  I'm almost getting used to it now.  Also, our key-less remote is supposed to unlock all of the doors with two presses of the button.  However this only works occasionally, and I haven't figured out how to work it.  

We have a cargo-area cover, cargo mat, rear tinted windows, power windows/locks, sunroof, CD/cassette/radio, cruise control, roof rack, removable rear seats, signal mirrors, key-less entry and security system.  As I said before, the interior is roomy and adequate for my husband and myself.  I don't know how that would change with children.  

The handling is nimble, and I can turn on a dime, which is a nice change from a pick-up truck.  The acceleration is adequate, I generally have no difficulty passing on the freeway.  I think it's pretty good for a V-4 engine.  Also the gas mileage is pretty good for a SUV.  I generally get 25 mpg highway.  

Overall, I am very happy with my RAV4.  It is the perfect size for my family right now, and fits me just fine.  I will have no hesitation (as of now) in buying another Toyota, and recommending Toyota to friends and family.
