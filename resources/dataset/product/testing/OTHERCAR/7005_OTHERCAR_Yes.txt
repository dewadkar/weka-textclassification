            After test driving a range of full size SUVs, I bought the Land Cruiser, and I love it. It is super quiet, and handles well for the 6800 pound car that it is. 

I first tested this car's off road ability on a hilly field with no visible road.  After blazing a trail to a vista point, I came to a super steep 15 foot incline near the top of a hill.  The Land Cruiser went right up and over it and onto the plateau, as if it were a driveway.  

On several occasions, I've transported 7 adults to an event in modest comfort. (This requires the purchase of the $2000 jumper seat option.)  On one occasion, I even transported 8 (there are seat belts for 8 people), but the three individuals in the rear jumper seats were quite cramped. Truth be told-- the rear jumper seats are not designed to haul adults over long distances, but for 1/2 to 1 hour trips, they are workable.  If you find yourself transporting more than 5 adults on a regular basis, you may want to look beyond the Land Cruiser, as there are better vehicles available for such tasks. 

A few quirks:
-- There is no automatic telescoping steering column option. This is an issue because the drop from the drivers seat to the curb is a few feet, and the steering wheel gets in the way when you get out of the car. I think the Lexus has a version which moves upward when you pull the key out of the ignition. Running boards help this problem a little.
-- Speakers aren't great, but serviceable
-- No sunglass holder option. You only get a bay for a garage door opener. This bay could easily have been made to hold sunglasses, but you don't get the choice. A lesser point, to be sure, but for 50 grand, I'd like to have the option for a $5.00 plastic piece to hold my sunglasses.
-- The Wood dash option is great to look at, but is basically just glued on over the existing dash, as opposed to being built into the dash.  If you are planning to get this option, I suggest you save your money.

As you can see, these are not show stoppers, but nit picky issues that could have been thought through by Toyota. 

As always, I recommend that you test drive a few different SUVs before making your choice. But if you absolutely have to make it to South America by the end of next week, and you want to get there in style, buy the Land Cruiser.
