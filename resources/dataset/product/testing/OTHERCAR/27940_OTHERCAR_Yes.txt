            I have always liked Audi cars, and I would recommend anoy of them out there, EXCEPT FOR THE A4 WAGON.  This car really is pretty dissapointing.
Here's why:
This car looks alright from the outside, but on the inside it is a completely different story
on the inside, the car is roomy in the front, but cramped for any adult in the back.  The seats are stiff and uncomfortable, and I was not even really all that impressed with the car's driving performance.  The steering is just about average, nothing bad, nothing great, and the braking is somewhat sticky.  Another thing I have noticed is that the standard stereo/cd player sounds weak in the car, and the worst part of all is the AIR CONDITIONING.  Anyone living in a hot climate definately stay away from this car for this reason alone.  The air is weak and it is not even cold, it just feels as if the fans are recirculating the air throughout the car.  On a hot summer day, even with the air conditioning blasting, you feel overheated and uncomfortable, making driving in this car a complete nightmare.  STAY AWAY!

Bottom line - This car is just barely satisfactory.  Anyone living in a HOT climate, STAY FAR FAR AWAY
