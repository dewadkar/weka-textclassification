            We bought our 1993 Plymouth Voyager when it was 4.5 years old with 62,000 miles. Except for a few minor issues with the A/C, it has been an extremely dependable and enjoyable vehicle. Especially if you have children (We have two you daughters).

We paid $6000 for our Voyager, but at the time prices were fairly high and the van wasn't that old. In the 2+ years that we have owned it we have not had any major mechanical problems. We have taken good care of the van (i.e. Regular oil changes, brakes, fluids, etc.) and it has taken good care of us.

The only complaint that I have is the fact that the base model, which we have, does not come with a tilt steering wheel. Otherwise, the seating is very comfortable, with good lumbar support in the front bucket seats. The dash and console are well arranged, except the radio, which is a bit of a long reach from the driver's seat. 

For long trips, and hauling large loads, the extra seats (7 passenger), plus the ability to completely or partially remove the seats, are indispensable. The only draw back to the seats are that they tend to be heavy and a bit awkward to reconfigure.

I have seen a lot of Plymouth Voyagers of this model year available on used car lots and via the Web. I have noticed that the general price tends to range from $2500 - $3500, depending on condition and location. Which is very reasonable for the size and type of vehicle being purchased.

Overall, I would say that this vehicle has been a great practical investment. I would not recommend this vehicle, however, to someone who is looking for an exciting drive or an economy car (Our's is a 3.0L V6, which I highly recommend, but tends to get ~20 MPG), but it has served us very well and continues to do so, with minimal maintenance.<br><br>
