            We bought our Outback Wagon just over two years ago. It's absolutely the best car we've ever owned. We've taken it on several overnight long-distance trips, and it's comfortable to ride in for hours at a time. It's a dream to drive, holds the road well, and gives a &quot;heavy, solid and safe&quot; feeling that gives a little confidence on busy highways. 

It's also full of creature comforts, that make driving a little more pleasurable, like cup holders and remote control rear-view mirrors. We got the &quot;cold-weather&quot; package, so we also have heated seats, heated rear-view mirrors, and heat on the windshield for snowy mornings. We get snow and ice in the winter here in Reno, and the car handles exceptionally well on bad roads.

We initially considered it for the all-wheel drive and anti-lock brakes, and we haven't been disappointed. I just can't think of one bad thing about the car, except the cup holder blocks the radio, and if that's the worst thing you can say, I guess it's OK! That must be why you see so many of them on the roads in Northern Nevada. They are just great cars.<br><br>
