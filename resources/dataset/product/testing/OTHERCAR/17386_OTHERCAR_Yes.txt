            I absolutely love this car!!! I've owned an '87 Ford Escort 4-door, '91 Ford Escort 2-door, '93 Isuzu Spacecab pickup, '93 Ford Escort, '95 Chevrolet S-10, '98 Chevrolet S-10 Extended Cab and now this car. It's a &quot;poor-man's Ferrari&quot; in my opinion. I bought it to finally own a real sports car without spending my entire life's earnings every month.
 The ride is very quiet even with a sunroof. With the sunroof fully opened, the occupants in the front feel very little wind buffeting. Rear occupants may feel like they are riding in a convertable. The only &quot;problem&quot; I've noticed about the sunroof is that it tends to squeak a bit after a heavy rain. The noise does go away after a couple of seconds of driving.
 The ergonomics are excellent. Everything is within easy reach, except for the tilting mechanism for the steering column. However, I don't see how Mitsubishi could make it any more accessible unless they put a little lever on the side of the column like some Pontiacs. YUCK! The stock CD player does suck though. I replaced mine with an aftermarket unit and that solved the radio dilemma. The stock speakers are pretty decent unless you're an audiophile like myself. The speaker locations are excellent and give the driver a true surround-sound experience.
 The exterior appearance of the car is still sleek and &quot;sexy&quot; even though Eclipses are a-dime-a-dozen. Keeping bugs off the front of the car is next to impossible. And keeping the front airdam from getting curb damage is even more impossible. Mine got scraped up from pulling out of my apartment complex. The driver has to have an incredible sense of just how low and long the front end is.
 I would suggest this car for drivers between 5' and 6'. Anyone smaller and seeing over the dashboard becomes a task and anyone taller would feel cramped between the center console and the driver's door. Anyone over 5' will feel live a sardine in the rear seats. And I use the term seats lightly. DO NOT BUY THIS CAR IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A 2ND FAMILY CAR! It does serve as a fun grocery-getter though. I drove for 1700 miles non-stop and my kidneys took the worst beating of my life! A great car for around town, but definitely not for extended trips.
