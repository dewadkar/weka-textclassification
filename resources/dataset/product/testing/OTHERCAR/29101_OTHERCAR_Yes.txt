            I purchased a Tacoma Prerunner in March of this year. I decided on the Prerunner instead of just the Tacoma because it had the rugged off road looks of the 4 wheel drive that the regular Tacoma didn't have &amp; thought I wouldn't ever need the 4 wheel drive. In the 9 months that I have owned this vehicle the following are my observations. The ride is very smooth for a off road truck, rides similar to a passenger car. Mileage is reasonable at about 20 mpg with the 2.7 liter engine it came with. The premium sound system with a CD drive is of high quality &amp; is recommended. I don't know about other Toyota dealers in the country but the one I dealt with was great. I found a small scratch on the truck the day after I bought it &amp; they fixed it at no cost, no questions asked &amp; I can't even tell where the scratch was, very good work. They gave me free oil changes, always send me coupons for other maintenance, &amp; are very friendly.
 On the negative side the 1st week I had the truck my nephew was getting out of the back from the extended cab &amp; brushed against the seat belt holder &amp; knocked it off. I snapped it back on but now makes an annoying squeaking sound if the seat belts are snapped in the holder. To avoid this I just let the seat belts lay on the seat instead of snapping them in place. I suppose I could purchase it very inexpensively as it is only a piece of molded plastic. The only other negative I have found is a button called the &quot;ect&quot; button which is supposed to increase power but is more like a gimmick button as I have never noticed ay power increase with it. Overall I am happy with the truck, it is very stylish, I don't expect nor have I had any mechanical problems &amp; I believe it will have a high resale value. On a scale of 1-10 I would give it an 8.<br><br>
