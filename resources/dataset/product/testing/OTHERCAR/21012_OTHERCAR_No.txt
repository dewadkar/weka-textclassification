            My Rav4 saved my life in 1999.  I had purchased it more than a week before the accident.  It had all but 212 miles on the odometer and I was driving from Cleveland the Traverse City to see my girlfriend for a much needed vacation in April of 1999.  One one of the busy intersections here in Cleveland, I was proceeding through when someone in the perpendicular
lanes slammed into my car (which was in the right most lane), causing my Rav4 to &quot;trip&quot; over the curb on the right hand side, causing it to roll over a total of four times.  It scared the heck out of me.

I managed to not only leave the scene alive, but was released from the hospital a few hours later with nothing more than some aching muscles and very slight abrasions on my driver's side arm.  The Rav4 was, well, it was totaled.  My laptop flew out of the window and landed UNDER my right rear tire.  It was totaled (and wasn't even paid for yet).

I found out later that the Rav4 only rolled because of how I was hit and how I hit the rather steep curb.  Everyone said I was lucky to be alive.  However, I knew what saved me was the Rav4, my seatbelt, and determination to hold on tight as I rolled.

So, did I want to buy another Rav4?  I sure as heck did.  However, when I went to the dealership they didn't have the color I wanted, so I opted for a Camry instead!  Was the ride nice?  Yeah, it sure was.  I also miss the cargo capacity it had.  In fact, I was going to help my girlfriend move to Cleveland, so the extra space would have been handy.  I had nothing buy fun and enjoyment from the 212 miles I spent with the Rav4.  I would buy another one in an instant if I had the money (and they had it in blue!)

Would I have survived it in another similar vehicle?  Perhaps.  Am I overestimating the safety of Toyotas?  Maybe.  I don't care, though.  I lived through something many people in the past have died from.  I'm very thankful and grateful to the engineers at Toyota, though, for designing a top quality automobile!<br><br>
