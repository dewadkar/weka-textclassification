            The Grand Caravan is a great idea poorly executed.  Very innovative, very ergonomic.  Ours had every possible thing go wrong with it, and we had the top of the line model.  By the time we sold it after 6 years, we had a pile of repair papers about 5 inches high.

The 3.8L is powerful and makes the large van fast, but it is more power than the Tranny can handle.  We went through three over a period of 138,000 miles.  The first one went bad after the first day (a bad omen).  The Second one went out at 30,000 miles.  We replaced the third one at 100,000 miles and at 120,000 miles, we started to get nervous and sold the van.  When we traded the van in, the first question they all asked was "how many transmissions?"  These vans have such a history with bad transmissions that many used car dealerships don't want to mess with them.  We didn't want to sell it ourselves because we didn't want to have to look those poor suckers in the face and lie to them.

The Van had horrible reliability problems, and we kept on fixing them hoping that after replacing everything, it would get better - not true.  We replaced everything from gas tank gaskets to the radio(X2) and the wiring harness.  Once when it was in the shop having the rocker arms replaced, the tower broke - that's not supposed to happen.  Beware, the battery is right over the wiring harness, so if the battery fails and leaks acid, you have to replace the whole wiring harness, a $2,000 repair, yet another of the problems we experienced.  When the wiring harness got messed up, it led to all kinds of problems, such as the engine computer failing and the rear warning lights (brake, turn, reverse) working whenever they felt like it.

The van also had several serious recalls that weakened our confidence in the van's safety including one that warned that in a rear-end collision, the rear bench might launch the passengers through the rear hatch. The van also scored a weak 3 out of 5 stars for safety according to the NHTSA.

For some weird reason, the windshield wipers had a mind of their own.  Sometimes they would wave just once (as if to say hi) and one time they sprayed on me as I was getting out of the van.  It was weird.

It wouldn't be fair to point out just the negative.  The Grand Caravan is a very comfortable van for long trips and can hold lots of stuff behind the rear seat because of the extended wheelbase.  The stereo was an Infinity system and sounded great, I was tempted to enter it in one of those car audio competitions just to see how well it would do.  I'd say it would be good for 6 adults on a long trip.  Since we had bucket seats, we were able to arrange the seats any way we wanted, which was kind of easy.  The third row bench seat rolls from back to front easy, but it's weight (about 100lb.) made it hard to remove from the van

The engine, a 3.8L, is powerful so it rarely ever hunts for gears, save only for when loaded down and climbing a hill.  It was really fun at stoplights because noone ever expected a minivan to pull off the line so fast, I beat several rice-burners.  Despite the power, I do not recommend towing because of the weak transmissions found in these vans.

We sold the van right after putting in a third transmission.  Overall we look at it as learning experience: 
(1)I learned how to be a mechanic and 
(2)my mom learned to get rid of cars when they break down the first day off the lot.
