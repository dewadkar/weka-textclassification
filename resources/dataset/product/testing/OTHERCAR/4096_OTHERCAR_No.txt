            First and foremost, a disclaimer:  We bought a 1998 Intrigue with the &quot;extreme citrus&quot; package -- it was a lemon.  My wife hangs around Epinions under the handle of &quot;babypod,&quot; and if you've read her review of our car, you already have an idea.

In 1998 we were in the market for our first new car.  We wanted a midsized sedan in the $20,000 range, and had a preference for domestic products.  We test drove the Mercury Sable, Chrysler Concorde LX and the Olds Intrigue before deciding on a totally base model Intrigue.

We bought one of those few cars in the American marketplace without a single option in them.  Even so, the Intrigue comes with power steering/brakes/locks/mirrors, 4-speed automatic OD transmission, cruise control with steering wheel controls, tilt, air conditioning, traction control, ABS and a nifty storage compartment for the driver to the left of the steering column...large enough for two boxes of Tic-Tacs.

The styling of the Intrigue was a <b>big</b> selling point.  It's just a handsome car -- the phrase &quot;muscular shoulders&quot; has been used to death to describe the fender bulges, but it's an apt phrase, and seeing those fenders in the outside mirrors always gave me a sort of, well, racy feeling.  It's superficial, it's a bit strange, but there you are.  People just like the looks of the Intrigue, and ours was one of the very few red ones in this area.  When parked outside a McDonald's restaurant, the only car I've ever owned that had a passerby actually walk up to it, admire it, and <i>pet the fender of it,</i> was our Intrigue sedan.

Driving the Intrigue was as much of a thrill as you can have when an automatic transmission is your only choice.  General Motors' venerable 3800 V-6, dating back to the 1960's, is decried in most auto publications as a &quot;boat anchor,&quot; and a low-tech dinosaur.  Be that as it may, the motor generated 195 horsepower and zero-to-60 times of about 7.7 seconds, while being silky smooth at all times.  The sound of the engine was not very exciting, sounding a bit like a tractor when the tachometer passed 5000 rpm.  The standard traction control system was easily defeated by the torque of the engine, as well.

Handling was definitely the strong point of this car.  Sprung stiffly for a sedan, curves were a joy to carve up, with minimal body roll and excellent feedback from the variable-assist &quot;Magna-Steer&quot; power steering.  This was a car that was supremely tossable.

The ride was tuned more for stiffness and handling than for &quot;compliance,&quot; or comfort.  The faster we went, though, the better the suspension worked to smooth out expansion joints and irregularities.  A subdivision road made of concrete slabs was concussive at 20 mph, but smooth as glass at 60, with only tire slap to let us know there were bumps.

Freeway driving was this car's second major strength.  Cruising at 75mph returned better than 30 miles per gallon, and the firm, flat seats had a touch of lumbar support right where my back likes it.

It must be said, though, that the base stereo system in the Intrigue was abysmally bad.  High-range, mid-range, low-range were all reduced to mud by the standard Delco speakers.  The stock head unit was unable to pick up FM stations across town.  We replaced the stock system with a Kenwood cassette deck and speakers from Polk Audio and Alpine...the difference was astounding, and cost $100 less than the factory Bose stereo upgrade.

But as I said, our car was a total and utter lemon.  We started having problems within 10 minutes of leaving the lot.  The problems we suffered in our 11 months and 18,000 miles of ownership are many and varied:

Body control module replaced

Instrument cluster replaced

Bad battery wire splice rendered the car unstartable

Right front tire blew out spontaneously

Right front wheel bearing needed replaced

Right front ABS sensor failed, taking the entire ABS <i>and</i> traction control systems with it...in Michigan ...in a blizzard ...at Christmas!

Right front suspension was bent &quot;as if the car slid into a curb&quot;

Transmission developed a &quot;shudder&quot; when shifting into overdrive

Driver's door sagged and stuck shut, needing re-aligned <b>5 times</b>

Brakes needed replaced at 18,000 miles

Tires were bald at 18,000 miles

Engine oil was <i>black</i> from Day One

Windshield wipers would stick straight up the windshield if there was snow under the cowl where they parked

Strong crosswinds made the car whistle out a loud &quot;WOO&quot;

Nearly undriveable in any adverse weather, dangerously so, due to the aforementioned bent suspension

I know this hasn't happened to all Intrigues, and I can only guess at what happened to ours.  Maybe it fell off a hoist at a dealership or the factory.  Maybe a driver nailed it to a curb during the 120 miles the car had on it at delivery.  We'll never know.  We hated the car enough to unload it on the local Buick dealership and buy the car we have now.<br><br>
