            I bought my Sunfire because it looked VERY cool.  I bought a two-door SE coupe with red exterior and red interior (yes, red interior - you can't even order that anymore).  I love the fact that this car is sporty yet practical.  I still get all kinds of looks when I drive it around (it pays to also use an excellent wax and wax it by hand in the shade).  I also get lots of comments from drive-thru window workers (&quot;Wow, cool interior&quot;).  

It is definitely a fun car to drive.  For a four-cylinder, it has a lot of power, and it corners really well.  

The car was problem-free for almost three years, needing only a couple of adjustments here and there.  It did have a rattle or two, but were fixed under warranty and did not come back.

I was very disappointed to find that, at 46,000 miles, it needed a new alternator and the brakes will soon need to be replaced.  However, I have been hard on this car - I drive a lot for my job - so maintenance is expected.

The car is a great buy for women.  It is small, affordable, reliable and fun.  <br><br>
