            So my husband and I decided to take a road trip and we did not want to load the miles on our personal cars.  We decided to go through Hotwire.com (review to come) to rent a vehicle to take us up the beautiful coast of California and not cost us an arm and a leg.  Yesterday morning I was handed the keys to a silver 2003 Kia Spectra.

Interior:  Comfortable enough for my husband and I and we are both tall.  I drove for 4 hours yesterday and I am 6 feet tall.  My shoulders ached but that could have happened in any vehicle.   I do not believe the back seat would fit two more adults our size.  Lots of cup holders and spots to put your change, cel phone etc.  All the controls are within easy reach and easy to understand.  Even a handy sunglass holder up between the sun visors.  Lots of head room, actually made me feel like I was in a fishbowl. 

Trunk: Truck is huge compared to what I am used to in my Honda at home.  We fit three large bags in there with some room to spare.  Back seat also folds down so you could put even larger items in there.

Ride: Ok so here is where I start doing the part of the review that may not be so positive.  As for the ride it is really bouncy.  Not the kind of rugged bouncy you get with a truck or maybe a sports car but the springy bouncy.  

Handling: I did not feel this car took corners well.  On the freeway it made me actually nervous taking a freeway curve at anything over 65.  My Honda takes the same types of curves over 80 with no pull or feeling of G force to the passenger.  It may just be me but I just drove this thing slow after a few unnerving curves.

Brakes: They work decent but I did tend to keep my distance because they do not feel as responsive as I would like.

Driving: Ok now this is the really bad part.  This car has NO pick up and NO acceleration power.  Getting on the freeway and catching up to speed is a real task.  Don't even think about passing the slow truck you get stuck behind.  Little torque and less horsepower make this car feel like a gutless wonder.  Once you get to speed it is a smooth ride but getting there takes patience.  This car has a auto transmission so a manual may give you a bit more get up and go.  

Mileage: We left home with a full tank and made it 300  miles.  That was with some stop and go traffic in LA.  I thought this was pretty good since we had the a/c running.  I am not sure the size of the tank but I would guess it is 12 gallons.  We did not use the cruise control the entire drive.

Paint: just a note on this.  I notice the different body panels seem to be fading at different rates.  This car only has 10k miles on it!  For instance the gas cap cover is a different shade of silver than the fender.  

So now I have 5 more days before I happily return this car back to the rental counter.   I will tie this up by saying if you are looking for a very inexpensive car for a teenager or just to do errands around town this may be for you.  If you are looking for something fun to drive that has some kick, keep looking elsewhere.
