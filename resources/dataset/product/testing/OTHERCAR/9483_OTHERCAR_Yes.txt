            I Love this Truck!  We, Hubby and I looked for 8 months to find a truck.  He had his heart set on a Dodge Ram (had to be the new body!  Taking 4 kids around looking at trucks was no picnic!  After a long hard search we finally found the one we both wanted.  The dealer came and picked me up (a half hour drive).  I drove the truck back to the dealer ship!  Just as I was getting off the freeway the transmission went out.  What a bummer!  We limped it to the dealership.  I almost started to cry. It had been a long hard search and I thought we were done!  Well the dealer said they would fix it, but I was hesitant.  He also told me they just got another one in! I said let me see it!  It was a lot nicer truck, less miles and I fell in love with it.  Called hubby and told him to get here (the dealership) fast!  I was going to buy it for him if it killed me.  When he saw it he fell in love with it.  It was a 94 shortbed 1500.  Someone had already lowerd it and put louder exhaust on it!  Had pinstripe kit on it.  It was one fine looking truck.  Only had 94,000 miles on it.  It rides like a car. Handles like a dream.  Whenever I can I take it just to go for a drive.  I wish my van drove as nice as it does.  The interior is excellent.  I wouldn't trade it for the world.
