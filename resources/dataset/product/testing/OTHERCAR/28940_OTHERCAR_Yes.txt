            I've had my '94 Mazda 323 for 6 years now.  I've had it since college.  It hasn't given me any mechanical headaches so far.  Acceleration is good for a 4 speed automatic.  It drives steadily both on side streets and on the freeway.  It has a light body, therefore, it doesn't gulp gas like crazy.  Power handling on curves is good because of its wide body.  

My only complain is the noise.  Because the body is light, you can hear everything from the outside, including the engine.  Also, the front seats are not comfortable for long driving.  This car is meant for city driving or short distances only.  It's great for small parking spaces in urban settings.  Other than these, this is a wonderful small car.  Performance is at par within its class.  It's actually more handsome than a Toyota Tercel.  California models have 16 valve options and these run like sports cars.  

I recommend this car for students, city drivers and low budget owners.  The price is also right.  <br><br>
