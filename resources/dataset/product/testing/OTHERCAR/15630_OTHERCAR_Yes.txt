            The Sony mavica FD-91 is a great camera.  I love the fact that you film right onto a floppy disk that can go straight into a computer without having to use any additional attachments or software.  

It is like getting two cameras in one since you can either take still photos or 60 seconds worth of video.  The camera is a little bulky for a digital camera but since you are really getting two cameras in one with a nice zoom feature it is worth the extra money and hassle with the large size.

It comes with adobe software so you can digitally alter the image and improve your photographs.

You have the option of transmitting a small &quot;e-mail&quot; version of your pictures or can send full size photos.  I had many people complain when I sent &quot;e-mail&quot; size photos that the images were too small so sending full size pictures is the best way to send pics to people.  This can get costly though if you are sending pictures from overseas if you need to pay by the minute internet access charges.

Overall this camera is a great tool and fun camera to own.  The ease of use and flexability of taking both still pics and video right on a disk make this the number one camera to own in my e-pinion.  <br><br>
