            I bought this vehicle because I was sick of borrowing friends' trucks. While it took a few weeks (and visits to car dealers) to find one I liked at a decent price, I am happy to say that I found a nice truck at a nice price. 

What I love about the truck: I find that the S10 sits up relatively high for not being a 4WD. Plus, it is very quiet and comfortable. Much more so than many cars I have ridden in. I would not hesitate to take this truck on a long road trip as it is very comfortable and nice to drive, as long as there are only two people in it as the seats in the back are very small.

Hates: Nothing. One thing that bothers passengers is the small hump on the floorboard of the passenger side. But, since I am usually the driver, it is not a problem. 

As I mentioned, the S10 is very comfortable and fun to drive. Seats are plush and the drivers side features a lumbar support.I have the extended cab and find that it is very useful for storing extra things (groceries, tools, shopping) that I would not want to put in the bed of the truck. The jump seats are nice to have and are fine for kids and small adults. However, I get complaints when my passengers ride in them for more than 20 minutes. 

The S10 gets pretty good gas mileage, as it is a four cylinder (28 highway and 23 city). I would estimate five miles per gallon less with the AC on).

The S10 is great for people who carry small loads and essential for a person with a home. Trips to the dump, hauling lumber or small loads, etc, are no problem. 

Overall, a great mid-sized truck. Smooth ride, room, comfortable and able to haul small loads make this a great truck for the person who needs a pickup, but does not want a full sized gas guzzler.
