            I have had my Kodak DC-215 digital camera for a little over two years, and I love it. This is the first digicam that I ever bought, and I am very glad that I got it.

One thing I would like to point out about these cameras that may not occur to some people, and that is the issue of megapixels. This is a one megapixel camera. The advertisements always seem to be pushing the cameras with more meagapixels. But think about it -- the more megapixels, the more room your pictures will take up on your hard disk, or other storage device. If you are a professional photographer, or if you are trying to win awards for your pictures, and you have a great deal of storage space for your photos, then by all means you should buy a 2 or 3 or 4 megapixel camera. But if you are taking snapshots of family and friends, vacation photos, etc. I think you are better off with a 1 megapixel (1-meg) camera, and the Kodak DC-215 is as good a 1-megapixel digital camera as you will find. Why do I say this? Well, if you take a shot with the 1-meg camera and print it on standard 4 x 6 photo paper, it will look fine. It will look as good as any photo you get back from the drugstore using a film camera. The only area where the 1-meg camera suffers is if you try to make larger photos, such as 8 x 10's. I don't know about you, but all I ever need is the 4 x 6's; I have never made a photo any larger than that, and I'll bet that you haven't either. So go with the 1-meg digicam, and enjoy the savings in storage space that it gives you. You will still have plenty of good, quality photos.

I like the Kodak DC-215 digital camera in particular for several reasons. It has all the features I need, including a 2X zoom, which means that I can set it for wide-angle or telephoto with the touch of one button. It has every feature that I need. I can review photos right after I snap them and delete them immediately, or later if I wish. It shows how much room there is remaining on the memory card. And this is important to me: it feels good in my hands. I can fit it in a shirt pocket, and take a photo with one hand if I want to. It is rather heavy, and I didn't like that at first, but now that I am used to it I actually like the weight of it. It takes quality photos, and the battery life is OK (no worse than the average digicam).

When I bought this camera in 2000 I thought I would get a 1-meg camera because prices were rather high back then, and then maybe buy a higher resolution digicam after the prices came down. Now that the prices have come down somewhat, I have decided to stay with the DC-215. Why? Because it is a great camera.
