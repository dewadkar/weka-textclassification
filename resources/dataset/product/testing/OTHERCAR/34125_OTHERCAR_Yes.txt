            Ours is a GMC 2500 Sierra extended cab, short bed pick up we purchased new in 1992 to haul our travel trailer has a heavy duty suspension from the factory.  
In the years since then, it has indeed hauled our travel trailer, and altogether has taken us 124,000 miles with good comfort and reliability.  It has pulled many trailers, from our travel trailer to the utility trailers, on the roads and around the farm.  
The 350 V8 EFI engine has been a strong and surprisingly economical workhorse, averaging 15mpg city and 18mpg highway (dropping only minimally when hauling a trailer).
The bed is galvanized under the paint, with no rust (and no bedliner ever used in it - though we did have a topper for the first 5 years). 
The only glitch we ran across was in the air conditioning switch, which needed to be replaced 3 years ago.  We also found out that if the freon levels are low, the AC simply stops working. 
This sounds a little short and sweet, but that's what we've experienced: an uneventful, comfortable, reliable vehicle that, while finally ready for a real tune up (on a recent trip our highway mileage dropped to only 17mpg from it's usual 18+), this truck shows no signs of aging or slowing down.
