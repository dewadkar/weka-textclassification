            Back in August of '99, I got into an accident going to my wedding in Vegas.  If it was not for the way the car was built or the way that is handles is could have been a lot worse.  We spun out and almost hit the side of a mountain, but because the car is very responsive I avoided hitting the side of the mountain.  Also because the way the car is made( the weight is distributed very evenly), we did not flip over.  This car is one of the safest cars around and I do recommend them to my friends.  Also on another note my wife's friend crashed on the freeway in a Saturn SL1 and only suffered a concussion.  The doctor said that if it wasn't for the car he would have died.<br><br>
