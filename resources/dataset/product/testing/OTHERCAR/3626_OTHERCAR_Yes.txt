                 I bought this car as a move up from a 5 spdM Civic CX hatchback, that was reliable and fuel efficient -35+mpg, but was  too small. I looked at the Accord, Camry and Maxima. All good cars but NO personality, performance [except the 5spdM Max], looks and they were way TOO Common. IMO the GTP trumps all of them, plus cars up to 10k more expensive, in quickness, handling, looks- ext. style. In addition, I had a $2500 GMcard rebate so I bought a loaded GTP for less than a v-6 Accord/Camry/maxima.       The engine is the soul of this car. I've never owned anything quicker - and that is what makes this car so much fun. No sedan [new] is quicker for less than $30k. It handles well, although it eventually understeers at the limit. To me, it looks understated cool and aggressive without being too showy. Only the side badge distinguishes the GTP, making this a wolf in sheeps clothing. The ride is on the stiff side, like German cars. It has enough room for 4 of me [5'9'']. It is louder than most in this class, but the engine note and stereo[12 cd] make up. 28500 miles in 7 mo.s. Only  synth oil/filter changes q5k miles. 2 warrarnty trips for a loose R front door molding. 22-28mpg -somewhat aggressive hwy miles primarily.                I would like more steering feel, better brake modulation [has ABS], less lean in hard corners, a higher rear seat [but headroom is already tight as it is], better qulity leather, and a 5 SPEED MANUAL<br><br>
