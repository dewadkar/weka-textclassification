            The big Grand Caravan 3.3 V6 SE we rented last month looked beautiful, but failed to impress. Driving around the West Coast for three weeks, the four of us put over 4,000 miles on the clock. Although the car certainly was big enough to accommodate four adults plus suitcases and backpacks etc. there were some disappointing details: 

The steering is too light, making the car a little 'nervous' on freeways. When driving the distances we were, this demands great concentration from the driver.

The passenger seat lacks a bar to hold on to in sharp corners. 

The back seat is just plain awful, completely failing to support the passengers during acceleration, braking and corners. After a few days some of us even refused to sit in the back seat. The seatbelts are very unpleasant, tightening up with every movement.   

The cruise control failed to function properly on numerous occasions, sometimes even displaying an own will or other funny behaviour (haunted?).
And finally, the 3.3 liter V6 engine disappointed. It seems to lack horsepower to smoothly get up the hills, making high revs (5000+ in D, 3 and L) just to do 55/60 mph. 

Overall: the big, nice looking car, failed to impress.
