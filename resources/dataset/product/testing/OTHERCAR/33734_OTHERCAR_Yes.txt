            The time has come, the faithful Mazda 626 is reaching old age and needs to be put out to pasture. Now the real problem arises, �How do you replace a thirteen year-old car that has given you virtually zero problems over it�s 130 thousand miles. 

I must say that the Mazda is by no means dead but there are issues that need to be dealt with and rather than spend the repair money I have opted to put it towards the purchase price of a replacement vehicle. You notice that I did not say �New� vehicle rather �Replacement� vehicle. Replacing a car that has given you few problems over the years is a tough thing to do. 

As luck would have it brother in-law was also looking to get a �New� car and wanted to sell his current car, a �95 Nissan Maxima. Knowing that he is very meticulous caring for his vehicles and that he periodically replaces his cars whether they need to be or not we let him know we wanted the car. A quick check of the car�s retail worth on www.bluebook.com told me that he was asking a reasonable price considering the mileage and vehicle equipment. My job was done; I had my replacement car, now he had to find his.

<B>The �95 Nissan Maxima.</b>

The following review was published in Nov 30 1999 New Car Test Drive.

�During its 14-year production life, the Nissan Maxima has survived four evolutions. The last version, which went out of production at the end of the 1994 model year, is perhaps the most familiar. Its distinctive appearance and sporty character - emphasized by an advertising campaign that stressed performance - made it reasonably popular with the general public while attracting the attention of car enthusiasts. 
No more. Nissan touts the 1995 Maxima as a leader in traditional sedan virtues, such as value, content and style, but downplays the performance image. Driving pleasure has not been ignored, but the focus has shifted in hopes of bringing in mainstream buyers. 
According to Nissan, early sales returns indicate that this approach is paying off. By that all-important standard, the new Maxima represents a major improvement over past versions and a solid threat to perennial chart-toppers such as the Ford Taurus, Toyota Camry and Honda Accord. 
By almost any other standard, the newest Maxima is indeed a better car. 

It offers fresh styling, a roomier interior, improved fuel economy, better straight-line performance and a more comfortable ride than any previous Maxima. 
But the shift in emphasis from sporty to, well, less sporty may drive owners of older Maximas elsewhere when replacement time rolls around. And it may throw some customers to such niche performance sedans as the impressive Volkswagen Passat GLX. Those are risks Nissan seems willing to take. So far, the company's strategy seems to be the right one. �

<b>The outside.</b>

The '95 Maxima represents the fourth generation of the highly successful Nissan model. The new generation maintains the Maxima�s basic design but the car is wrapped in an entirely new skin. While the Maxima model is the starship of the Nissan brand the new version is influenced heavily by the shape and proportions of the smaller Altima. The new model is a big step away from the sharp square lines of the earlier Maxima�s. The rounded design was high tech for the day but time has shown it to be successful as other auto manufacturers have all followed suit. 
In addition to the new body work the rear suspension was changed to add overall body rigidity. The cars power plant has always been reliable offered great performance and the version offered in the �95 is no exception. Nissan has increased the cars dimensions by an inch over its early predecessor but has eliminated 100 pounds from the overall weight. 

<b>The interior.</b>

The �95 Maxima while only an inch longer than the earlier models does offer a great deal more interior room. Being 6�5� interior space this has always been a priority for me. The rear seats, while not huge, do offer a sufficient amount of legroom for the average person.

The interior design is a very contemporary design. The dashboard and door panels present a flowing appearance, instruments are large and legible, and most controls are arranged in a logical manner. The leather seating is high quality and has held up very well. The floor mats, while showing some wear; seem to also have held up very well over the past five years. I feel that headroom is at a premium but then again I am taller than the average person and am not the primary driver of the car. The rear sit provides enough legroom for my two kids although I do not know if I would want to sit in the rear seat.
The trunk provides adequate storage for suitcases or in our case large hockey bags. The spare tire is easily accessible along with the jack; I use AAA so I hope I won�t get very familiar with this part of the car.

The stereo has been upgraded to include a CD player. Unfortunately I do not have the original specifications of the upgraded audio equipment but can say that the sound quality is very nice. The car did have the option of a trunk mounted CD changer but the original owner did not opt for the unit.

Like all things in life the interior design is not perfect, the front seats while comfortable and classy looking are a little short on thigh support for taller people like myself. While the overall dashboard layout is ergonomically designed some of the dash controls are not real user friendly. Our model is equipped with a moon roof that provides, in my opinion, little advantage while unfortunately reducing the headroom.   
 
<b>The ride.</b>

Our Maxima is equipped with a six cylinder that provides a great deal of power. The car shows no strain in highway driving or steep hills. This power plant has been a prime feature of the Maxima since it�s introduction and it still provides more than adequate performance. The transmission is a 5-speed manual, standard on the GX. 

The redesigned suspension provides for a very smooth, quiet comfortable ride. The steering is very good and maneuvering the car is no issue. I have found that while this car is not one that you will race on your local track it is a great car and a real joy to drive whether it is on the interstate or through the city.

<b>The final word.</b>

The �95 Maxima is a great drivers car. Unlike many cars the power plant is adequate and provides more than enough power. Our car has 80 thousand miles on it and I believe that with good care should last for many years to come.

We got our car from a reliable source and know the car�s history; I know I got a great deal. If you are looking for a car that offers great performance and carries the reputation of the Nissan Company give the Maxima a try. It may not be the top of the line sports sedan but it is a very solid reliable choice. Do your homework and look through the used cars sales, I�m sure you can find a car that will provide you with the same driving enjoyment ours has for us.
