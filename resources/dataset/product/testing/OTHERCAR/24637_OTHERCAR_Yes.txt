            I'm no expert--just a woman in her late 50's who does a lot of driving on California freeways.  I had driven an Acura sedan for 8 years and was looking to match the luxury and reliability of that car while watching price and model features.  When I bought in February, there was absolutely no comparison between the Infiniti I 30 and the other luxury cars(Lexus 300, Audi, Acura RX) in terms of price.  In terms of looks and features, most of them were comparable although the Lexus did have a bit more style.  Am I happy--you bet.  After more than 5000 miles of driving, I can report complete satisfaction.  From the minute I got into the car and turned the key for the first time, I have experienced nothing but pleasure.  This car has comfort and style, passing pickup and cruising ease.  I particularly like the automatic night vision rearview mirror feature and the CD stereo system.  For those of you who like luxury at affordable prices, this is the car to pick this year.<br>
