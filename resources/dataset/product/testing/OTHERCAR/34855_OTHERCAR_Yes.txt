            After years of buying Fords (Taurus stations wagons and Windstars) we were ready for a comfortable, safe AND reliable mini-van.  We had heard much about the Honda Odyssey.  After talking to several friends who had bought them, we finally made the plunge. 

Now almost 10 months later, we're very happy with our purchase. 

What's great about the Honda:
1. The sale: Honda treats you like an intelligent person.  Yes you might have to wait a few months to receive your car, but they don't use silly sale tactics to cross-sell you products or services you don't want. 

2. Customer service: From day one we've been impressed with the service.  When we were an hour late for a maintenance appointment our dealer called to find out if everything was OK and if we were going to come in that day.

3. The car: It's great.  Handles like a sports car sedan (50 mph on an Interstate exit without a hitch); comfortable inside; very, very quiet (I sometimes question if the car is on when I'm stopped at a light); parks much easier than our 1997 and 1995 Windstars; factory sound system is good (we didn't see the need to upgrade it as we've done with our other Swedish sedan); smooth ride (not as nice as a sedan but then it is a minivan); fold-down third seat and rear well (a nice space addition over other minivans).

4. Safety: We bought Winstars previously because of its superior safety record.  Now with the latest figures on highway safety (see http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/ncap/cars/2000Vans.html) we saw that Honda appeared to be as safe as the Winstar, based on the federal data.

What I don't like or could be better:
1. The look.  It's not the snappiest looking car around.  But it IS a minivan.  
2. Moving 2nd seats together or apart is difficult (unlike the Mazda minvan) 

What is it like to drive?
Our first big trip was through the mountains.  I really enjoyed cruising at nice speeds.  It does not feel like a minivan.  Much more solid and responsive. 

Should you buy this minivan?
If exterior style is of little concern, but safety, reliability, comfort and durability are, I'd give this car very serious consideration. 

******************************************
I originally wrote this opinion after owning the Odyssey for 3 months.  Now we've owned it almost a full year.  We appreciate it even more.  When we take the car into for service (to change the oil and repair a piece of hard plastic that didn't survive kids pounding on it) I was stunned that the bill was less than $70. 

The minivan continues to ride very well and in general is holding up to the daily beatings of a very busy family.  Finally I'm really pleased that for the first time in a quite a while we bought this vehicle, rather than lease it.  It's a very, very good buy for the money.
