            My brother bought a Honda Prelude.He like's this car for four different reason's,the first reason is he get's good gas mileage.The second reason is he does a lot of traveling and has not broke down in it.The third reason is it has a sunroof,great stereo,and automatic windows.He has driven this car in to the dirt.What I mean by that he has done everything you wouldn't you normally wouldn't do with a subcompact car.This come's to the fourth reason why he like's this car,it still run's and sound's like the day he bought it.So,if you are looking for a good subcompact car that you can get good gas mileage,run in to the dirt and it still sound's and run's like a new car,I suggest you look at the Honda Prelude at you local Honda Dealer.<br><br>
