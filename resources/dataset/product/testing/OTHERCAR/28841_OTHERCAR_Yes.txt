            For Christmas this year I wanted a new camera so I could capture all those special moments in mine and my kids life.
 Well my DH (he is on my good side right now so the DH means darling hubby) did alot of searching to find the best deal for his money.  He found the KodakDC210 Digital 210 plus camera.
This camera is so awesome. The pictures are really clear and you can see them right away so you know which ones you want to save or which ones you don't.  Don't like the picture.. then just trash it right then and there.
Wanna Jazz up the picture some..then choose one of the fantastic backgrounds for it.
Then decide which ones you want to send to grandma or your long lost friend from high school and download into your computer and send by way of email.
Its great.  A little more expensive than a regular camera but you never have to buy  film again.  you also never have to spend all that money to pay someone else to develop again either. Just download to your computer and print them up on your printer.  You have them instantly.
I highly reccomend the Kodak DC 210 Digital Plus Camera.<br><br>
