            I have the <b>Olympus D-360L</b> digital camera and I'm more than satisfied with it.  The reason I purchased it was simply for another &quot;toy&quot; to play with.  Let me tell you about the camera so you can decide if this is the one for you.  (I purchased mine from eCost.com for $280.)

The basics of the camera (shooting, transferring and deleting) were easy to learn. 

<i>The features of this particular model are as follows:</i>

-1.8&quot; LCD Screen�.You are able to adjust the brightness of this screen to make it easier to view your image.

-Regular Optical Viewfinder�.Of course the window has the guidelines to help you center your image.

-Resolution�.1280x960, the images seem really clear and crisp when they are downloaded onto the computer.

-Memory�.8MB SmartMedia card which can hold up to 122 shots at the lowest resolution.

-2x Telephoto mode�.It doesn't seem like much of a zoom, but it's better than nothing.

-1.3 Megapixels 

-Panorama option�.This isn't what it sounds to be.  In fact, you take separate pictures and put them together using the software provided.  I've had some turn out really nice, and others that didn't fit together so well.

-Burst shooting mode�.This allows you to fire off 10 images in � second intervals.

-Time &amp; date stamp�.

-Built-in self timer�.You get 12 seconds after pressing the shutter button before the picture is taken.


The camera comes with 4 AA batteries, Video output cable, Serial cable to connect to the computer and software to manipulate the pictures.  The software isn't anything complicated, it's just a basic editing program.  

I recommend you invest in rechargeable batteries as the camera does go through them fairly quickly, especially  if you use the LCD screen a bunch.  The company also doesn't provide you with an AC adapter and that is a must when you transfer the pictures to the computer or try to view them on the TV.  A man could go broke buying batteries if at least one of the recommendations above aren't followed.

Using the cable provided to transfer the pictures to the computer is a slow process.  After trying a friend's, I have found that using a FlashPath Floppydisk adapter it so much quicker.  

This camera allows you to view a photo just seconds after taking it, and you have the option of deleting the picture if you find it isn't what you hoped it would be.  On the flip side, with just a push of a button, you can protect a picture from being erased until you turn of the protection on a particular picture.

They have included a user's guide to explain all the details of the camera, and I read through the whole thing, and found it easy to understand.  There is also a limited warranty from 1 year of the purchase date.

I absolutely love my camera, and could only be happier with better telephoto capabilities. It is really nice not having to wait to have the pictures developed to see if they turned out or not.  With this digital camera, you can view the pictures immediately so you are sure you recorded the image just the way you wanted.  I found that the digital pictures are of a much better quality than my pictures that I have scanned onto the computer previously.  Another important detail is the fact that the camera counts down the number of pictures that you can fit onto the card at whatever resolution you are using.

I would highly recommend this camera to the regular &quot;Joe&quot; who just wants to point and shoot, but still wants the other &quot;options&quot; available.
