            After coming out of a 1998 Ford ZX2, this is definitely a step up.  The car is very quiet and smooth.  Something I was not expecting in a sports car, but not necessarily a bad thing.  You can forget about tight U-turns in the Eclipse, something that I miss in the ZX2.  This is more of a "sit back, relax and drive" sorta car than a, say Mustang GT where you can race anyone in the street and most probably win.  But don't get me wrong, the V6 engine is quick.  

Two major faults that annoy me quite a bit.  The first is the location of the cup holder.  If you have an automatic, then it's fine, but if you have manual transmission, forget about keeping a bottle of water in the holder and driving in the city.  You can't grab the shifter because the bottle comes in the way.  And worse off, there is absolutely no other place to put it.  The second fault is the positioning of the spoiler.  From the outside it might look pretty low, but when you sit in the car, it comes right in the middle of the rearview mirror.  Sometimes I think if the designer ever sat in the car.

Other than that, this is a great car.  100% Japanese, so I plan to keep it for a while.
