            I bought my 2004 Matrix XRS AWD in Nov. of 2003. I was impressed by its good looks and its handling when I test drove it. 

Now that I have been driving it for a while I have had the chance to experience the AWD in the snow as well as the standard anti-lock breaks (with the AWD) and can happily report that this car did very well. I was able to drive up a very steep hill that my '96 Camry could not make in the snow. The anti-lock breaks did equally well bringing me to a controlled and swift stop on slick roads.

On a long trip I took, I was able to load a lot of stuff in the back with the seats folded down and still see out the rear window. The car handled well on the highway even with all the weight in it.

The engine is a little loud in hard acceleration but not unusual for a 4 cylinder engine. Gas mileage averaged 29 on the highway but 27 in my 50/50 drive to work. 

The only bad thing I can say about this vehicle is that its got a small fuel tank, only 11.9 Gallons. I was used to going almost 500 miles between fill ups and in the Matrix it's about 300.
