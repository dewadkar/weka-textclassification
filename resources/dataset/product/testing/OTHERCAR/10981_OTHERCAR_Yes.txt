            I bought this car [2003 LS] new about a year ago.  So far it has been extremely reliable.  I had not driven a stick shift for years and was able to easily get back into the swing of things.  The gear box in the Miata is very good; the gear changes are smooth and effortless.  If you are considering the Miata with the automatic transmission you are missing the point of the Miata and depriving yourself.  If you&#146re looking for performance, then a 4 cylinder engine mated to an automatic is not your best bet.  Stick shift is the way to go.  

The interior is rather nice for the price range and the quality is fine.  The leather seats are perforated and provide good support in the twisties. The BOSE stereo tries its best and has a good punch even with the top down at reasonable speeds. 

The actual driving experience is go kart like and the steering is very accurate.  Point and shoot type, go kart like, razor sharp all comes to mind as accurate descriptions.  I regret not getting the optional sports package since I prefer a firmer ride and less body roll. Most new cars tend to loosen up a bit with time and I hate that feeling.  I like things to be tight and firm; currently shopping for a good aftermarket suspension set up. For the most part, the standard set up is fine and does allow one to kick the tail out a bit.  

On rough roads you will feel most of the road imperfections but that tight suspension shines in corners.  This car is not made for cruising on the interstate for long hours; I took a road trip to Key West and ended up with a stiff back.  But during this road trip the storage space of this lil' roadster was impressive.  While lacking in depth it is pretty wide and was able to hold two 22 inch aircraft type carry on bags and a laptop without any issues.  Speeds over 60 mph on the interstate makes the car feel a bit unstable; a type of slight shake or jitter.  The optional sports package might help tie it down and reduce this feeling.  

The best bit about this car is with the top down it gives you the sensation of going faster than you really are.  Which brings us to the whole safety issue; well it is what it is.  It is a light rear wheel drive car with great handling.  So you can handle your way out of a tight situation :)  If you are worried about a possible rollover then there are several roll bars available for installation. 

So, overall this is a wonderful car and there is a great community out there you can reach out to.  There is a lot of aftermarket support and the fan base is very loyal.  You can probably find a local group in your area with who you can map out routes or learn more about your car.  

With the top up, in heavy traffic and bad weather this car is no peach.  If this is your only ride then well, you might end up with a bit of a love hate relationship.  It is ideal during those warm summer nights and weekend trips; therapeutic almost.  

I am a student so it fits my current needs and its limitations are not a hassle.  Oh, most girls like the way car looks.  I have been getting a steady stream of compliments a year down the road.  The design of this car has a sort of classic look and will certainly last for a long time.  

P.S. This car has a great mechanism to silence back seat drivers; simply insert key and turn off their passenger side airbag.  Then proceed to start driving like a maniac and you will have the desired effect :)
