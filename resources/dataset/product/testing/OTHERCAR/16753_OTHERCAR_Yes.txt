            This is my second Town Car. The first was a '97.  The quality of both cars is above what I originally expected.  The most wonderful part of owning a Lincoln is the quality of care given the owner as well as the car by the dealership.Regular maintenance (oil changes etc.) are less expensive than at the franchise places. (Jiffy Lube etc.) The ride is smooth and quiet.  There is some noise if the window is open.  I had been told to expect problems in snow and ice..not so.  My driveway is steep and often icy but the car takes it all in stride.  I was pleasantly surprised by the gas mileage of both cars...varying from 19 mpg to 25 mpg.  My only real complaint is that the '99 seems to have less space (width) in the front than that of the '97. My choice of a Lincoln came about because I wanted luxury as well as a big car (I feel safer). Those who wish to drive a car with unequaled reputation and immediate recognition by the general public should certainly consider a Town Car. The finish on both cars withstood two New York Winters.<br><br>
