            I've always wanted a second generation MR2. I think it's still one of the best looking cars on the road, even after 10 years. I finally gave in and bought a clean, stock 91' Turbo with about 80K miles. I have no regrets whatsoever. The car just feels perfect. Aside from it's stunning looks (although I'm not too crazy about pop-up headlights), it has the performance to back it up. There's nothing like driving with a potent engine purring and sometimes roaring right behind you. 

The handling is exceptional. Point it in a direction and it goes there. The seats are comfortable. Controls are logically arranged. The turbo version has 200hp, which is more than sufficient. All this, plus legendary Toyota reliability. 

I can't think of many negatives...maybe the lack of storage space. But, heck, you shouldn't expect to be lugging groceries in this car anyway. The MR2 makes an excellent 2nd "fun" car. It would be nice if the car had cupholders though. Luckily, I haven't needed to take the car in for any repairs/maintenance but I do believe the Turbo version does cost a lot for major service. 

But again, no regrets...this car really is a dream come true.
