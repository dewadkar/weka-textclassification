            I love the sporty look of the car for starters.
It seems that most of the imports look similar, the Grand Am has ugly plastic ribs and the Ford offering is just boring.

I have been a fan of Daimler/Chrysler styling for many years and have owned a few.  I was recently concerned about the quality of their products.  Fortunately, I have never had any bad experiences.

So, with luck on my side, I purchased a 2001 Stratus SE, well equipped, for 20K.  If you buy &quot;off the lot&quot; you get a $1700 credit from Chrysler.

The car has a very strong V6 and corners like a sports car.  I previously owned a Dodge Avenger and the Stratus corners at least as well.  The interior has fake wood, which I could do without, but the dash is higher then the older model so the controls for the radio and climate are in easy reach.  The cup holders are more usable now and larger cups will not interfere with the dash or gear select.  The seats are comfortable without being too soft and the materials feel like a better quality then in previous models.

Even though the car shares many parts with the older model, the changes make the 2001 Stratus a much nicer car to drive (and look at).  The V6 accelerates well from a stop and has plenty of passing power.  The cabin is very quiet.  It does feel more closed-in then the previous model but still offers the same usable space.

The styling makes the Stratus look like a smaller Intrepid and that brings a big smile to my face.  My overall impression is that the car is a sports car with four doors.  I have no regrets about buying this car but then again, it is only three days old.<br><br>
