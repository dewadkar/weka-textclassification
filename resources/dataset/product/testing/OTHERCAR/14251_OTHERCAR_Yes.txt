            I just got a 99 Infiniti G20 and let me tell you about the best car I have ever driven.  This car is stylish, sporty, and affordable for a luxury car.  The ride is pretty smooth for a smaller car and it can give you quite a kick of acceleration and a very good burst of speed if you need it.  The sound system was surprisingly good.  This Bose, 6-speaker system tops out at around 100-150 watts.  I have a sunroof, spoiler, 6 CD changer, and a pretty nice leather interior.  I think that red is one of the better colors on this car becuse it is not the loud, obnoxious red but it is more like a racing color red.  This car is one of the most amazing all-around cars that I have ever driven and I love being a proud owner of a 99 infiniti g20.<br><br>
