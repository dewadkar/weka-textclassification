            Summer is here - the top must go down. Convertibles are more than just cars, they are mood enhancers, time machines, attention grabbers.  Convertibles are just plain fun and the 2000 Miata SE is no exception.

This car is perfectly beautiful.  The Nardi wood steering wheel, brake handle and shifter add a bit of elegence to an old sports car. The black on white gauges with a chrome ring around them remind one of Ferrari's past. The mahogany paint combined with the tan leather seats had 50 year old women asking &quot;what kind of car it that?&quot; 

Under the hood is a 1.8L twin cam 4 cyl, and it likes to rev.  The SE comes with a 6-speed manual, so up-shifts seem to come quickly during spirited driving.  The short throw shifter makes shifting fun. The 4 cyl gives 140 hp, not a lot if you are comparing to a Porsche Boxter or Honda S2000.  However a well equipped Miata can be had for about $23,000 (the SE is $25K) just try taking that price to your Honda or Porsche dealer.  Besides, the Miata is not slow, 2nd gear tire chirps are easy to come by, and there is plenty of torque anywhere between 4000 and 6000 rpm. As an added bonus you'll get a very pleasant exhaust note, similar to an old Fiat 124.

While straight line acceleration is quite rewarding, the real fun lies in the near perfect handling - at any speed.  The 195/15 tires grip like fly paper, and there is almost no body roll - remember your first go-cart?   It is possible to bring the back end around, but you really have to want it.  The limited slip rear end is an excellent option, get it.

There are no surprises inside the Miata, everything is where it should be.  Heating, A/C and stereo controls are all within easy reach, but why wouldn't they be, there's not much extra space.  The seats are comfortable for a couple hours, and the instrument cluster is very straightforward and easy to read at a glance.  A few minor complaints: not enough storage space, and a non adjustable steering column.

Overall it's a very fun car.  Mazda re-invented the 2 seat sports car 10 years ago, and the latest edition reminds us just how great a job they did.<br><br>
