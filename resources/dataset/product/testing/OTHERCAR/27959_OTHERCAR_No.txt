            I leased a new Audi A4 Quattro.  The car looked good and test drove well at the dealership.  Since that time the car has constantly been in the shop.  I did select the extra sport package with superior tires.  That was a waste I have since replaced all of the tires do to defects that are not covered by warranty.  Also the brakes have been replaced twice due to malfunction.  Luckily this was under warranty but my car was out of commission during the repairs.  The cigarette lighter has broken on 7 occasions and I was advised by the dealer that it has been recalled.  The horn works only when it wants as does the security system.  Also I have problems with the passenger side power door lock which does not work.  The stereo sounds good, but the cassette player stopped working after 1 month.  The CD player is okay.  Note I also choose the top of the line stereo.  The back seat appeared good size in the showroom and on the test drive, but is very small.  The tiptronic is a waste of time and money and really serves no purpose.  The car does drive well when it is not in the shop being worked on, but no way would I ever spend this kind of money on an Audi again.  When my lease is up in a few months I will be looking at a Mercedes.
