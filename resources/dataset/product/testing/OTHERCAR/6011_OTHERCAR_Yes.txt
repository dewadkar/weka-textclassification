            I was around 8 years old when we bought our Toyota Corolla.  That was back in 1992 when this was considered a new car.  I accompanied my mother to the dealership and we found the little car sitting in front.  It was light blue and the whole car reflected a sense of that special car new-ness.  The only miles on it were from previous test drives.  After some paperwork, the car was ours.  

I practically grew up with this car.  It has given us 10 trouble free years of faithful use, and we expect many more to come.  This car has been driven in rain, snow, hail, up mountains, through sand from the beach, on ferrys, and just about every where in North Carolina.  It has never had any problems and has just reached it's 118,000 mile mark with no major repairs.  Now, this little Corolla is my car.  I learned to drive in this car and I must say that it has the best handling of any car I've ever driven, including my mother's new Hyundai Sonata.  Even my mother would tell you that the Toyota was easier and more comfortable to drive than her own car or any other car she's had. After 10 years, this car is still just as attractive and useful as it was the day we bought it.  It has great gas milage, so it will never drain your wallet.  I think that it has about a 10 gallon tank on it.  

While it's a great car, it does have a few very minor flaws. For example, it's not a very powerful car.  It tends to have a little trouble on steep hills and may need a bit more gas than usual to get up the hill at a good speed.  The heater takes a while to heat the car.  Also, the ash tray compartment in the back seat tends to fall out.  


Other than these few things, it's a great car.  It is quiet on the road, comfortable, incrediably easy to handle and really inexpensive.  It's worth every penny we've paid for it and I would recommend this car to any one.
