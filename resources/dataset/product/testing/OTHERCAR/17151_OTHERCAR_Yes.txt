            2 years and I'm still in love with this car. Of course, with all love affairs, there are good and bad aspects. I bought this car soon after it was released, but luckily without the $5,000 markup that was the norm for dealerships in LA. It was a very hard car to find at the time and I was wondering if it was worth all the trouble (since the Porsche Boxster was readily available in comparison). It was worth the trouble.

Driving the car is fun, some people may not consider that a top priority but it is important if you spend a lot of time in your car, which most of us do nowadays. The car does exactly what I want when I want it, be it picking up speed, turning a curve or stopping on the proverbial dime. Performance is Mercedes all the way.

I could talk about the convertible aspect all day, but in a nutshell, I sometimes feel like I own two cars, a sports coupe and a convertible. When you drive a SLK for a while you have to fight the urge to point at cloth top convertibles and cringe. I admit to being spoiled by the hard-top, which transforms my coupe into a convertible in 30 seconds. There is nothing on the road that can do that (ok, I lied, the Mitsubishi 3000 Spyder does that).

Of course, there are sacrifices in the SLK. Roomy has not been a word I associate with my car. As two passenger cars go, its typical. Many times, I've wished I could lean my chair back just a bit more, but alas, not gonna happen. With the top up, the trunk is as spacious as a C class MB and there's quite enough room for groceries with the top down.

Several other little annoying things: The seats are a pain to adjust. The cupholder is in the worse possible place (above the center air vents). The windows don't come down all the way down. The rearview mirror is ridiculously small and the visor mirrors are just plain embarassing. 

Now for the test of time factors. Two years into ownership, I find the car still as reliable on the road as when it was brand new. Scheduled maintenance has been a breeze, the car asks you to bring it in so you don't have to keep mental notes to yourself.

Now here comes the bad parts:

I'm not sure if I personally bought a lemon, but my car has had a few minor annoying things that have caused me to know the service guys well. First problem was when it was 4 months old, something was wrong with the air compressor (not the Kompressor) which made the fan hit something and cause a rather annoying buzzing sound. (Notice I am NOT a technical genius). Under warranty, no biggie. 
Second was a bad rear lamp indicator that I was told was just a loose bulb. 
Third was the low coolant  fluid indicator, which cost me two trips until the service guys realized it was not the coolant at all but some other system that tapped into the same area and just needed to be replaced. (Yes yes, I wish I could provide more details but they talk tech and I just smile.) 
Fourth was a driver side panel that came a little loose and they just decided to replace it. Fifth and most recent is a little whinny buzzing noise coming from the air vents as I turn on the AC.

So, not an exact picture perfect service record but I really can't complain. Nothing on the scale of a total meltdown and I figure that's the cost of buying SLK version 1.0.

Overall, I don't regret buying the car and I don't intend to part with it anytime soon. And you can never get used to the great things people say about it.

*UPDATE*
It's November 2000 and that would mean that my SLK is now exactly 3 years old. I'm glad to say that since the last report, nothing significant to note. The car went in for it's first checkup at about 12k (It told me when it needed it). That went well and since then there hasn't been anything wrong at all. The buzzing noise I mentioned is still around but less frequent, they never could find it but I have a feeling it might be debris stuck somewhere. The gas mileage is consistent and hasn't gone down. The tires are just starting to show wear so I expect to need replacements next year.  I wish I could make this update more exciting but there's not much to say. If you buy one, you won't regret it.
See you next year!
