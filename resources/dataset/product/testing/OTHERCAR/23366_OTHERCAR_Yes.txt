            The 55 amd is the greatest suv on earth.  It has a central stabilizing system that is only present in 1 other vehicle in the world, the hummer.  If 3 of the 4 wheels are spinning but have no traction, them there is no use to exert any more energy.  This is what the system thinks.  When the 55 senses the spinning without any traction, the wheels that do have the traction gets all the energy, all the energy that is going towards the spinning wheels is channeled to the wheels with traction and the mindless spinning stops.  Aside frome the centralizing system the 55 AMD has over 320 horsepower backing it up as the most powerful suv on earth. 
	On the interioir of the car is a one of a kind soundsystem provided for by the BOSS sterio system.  The car comes with a 6 by 6 inch tvscreen fully equipped with onstar and digital radio. Behind the screen is a place to put in a tape.  Under the screen is a spot for the cd payer.
The 55 AMD M Class is a limited edition car, only 2,300 are made in the world and if presented with the chance to buy one, only a fool would pass up that oportunity!
