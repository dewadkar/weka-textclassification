            If you're looking for style and performance without breaking the bank account, '99 Miata is for you - 2000 models are out with minor changes.  Look for clearance sale or lease returns on '99 especially priced less even with add ons (i.e., leather, alloy wheels).  I did!  The new Miata got rid of flip lights and went with streamlined look.  The overall body style was changed compare to first generation Miata - resulting in a classic roadster look.

Expect same interior ergonomics (cup holder below shifter is inconvenient - get after market holder that can be screwed below shifter) and trunk space is to be expected - hey, this is a convertible not a van.  As long as you can fit two small backpacks, groceries for two dinners, a couple of bottles, and camera, you're good to go for a weekend getaways.  Top is easy to use, however, you have to pull on a little long bar to prevent pinching.  Engine and weight is nicely matched (compare to others with more horses) - resulting good handling corners and pick-up speed on freeway.  5 speed manual is easy to toss around, but don't try to race this car.  It's not meant for it; get a Z3 M Roadster but pay a hefty price.

Factory 100 watts CD/AM/FM radio is ok with quality CD sound when top is closed and street driving, however, you can't hear it well top down at high speed - look for after market speakers.  I opted for no AC since I live near the coast, leather seats, alloy wheels and low profile tires.  I picked silver exterior with black top and interior (leather seats) for even more classic look; Green exterior with tan top was my alternative choice. Don't fall for expensive paint protection and extended warranty.  This car follows traditional Mazda quality.  Otherwise, great value for price, features and looks.<br><br>
