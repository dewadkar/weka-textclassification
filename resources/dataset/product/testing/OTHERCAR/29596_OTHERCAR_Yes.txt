            I bought my 1993 Dodge Dakota 4x4 in 1998.  Since then I have put almost 100,000 miles on it and it keeps going strong (158,000 miles now).  I have the plain model, no frills, long bed, regular cab, v6, automatic.  It came with a bedliner.

Pros:  This truck has never given me any real problems.  I did get stranded when the fuel pump went out, but even then it warned me that it was going to break down.  I had time to drive into town and pull into a car wash.  I haven't replaced anything else.

It's geared high (2.50?) so it gets pretty good mileage for a truck (16.5 mpg), but don't expect it to tow anything.

Having a bedliner is a godsend.  I have hauled lots of stuff that would have scratched my paint otherwise.  This one is hard, slick plastic, so be sure and buy some ratchet straps to keep anything from sliding around.  Buy GOOD ratchet straps.  

Long bed is great.  Holds what some full-sized trucks will.

Might want to leave the tailgate down or get a flow-through.  This raised my MPG by 1 (to 17.5).  

Cons:  The radio that came with it and the "sound system" are laughable.  Only 5 fm presets and no scan feature.  This is easily replaced.  

It is a 4x4, but don't take it too far offroad.  It's good in snow and light mud, but the gearing is wrong for real mudding.

Bench seat is ok.  Wouldn't take it cross country.  I fit fine (6'1") with my baby's car seat next to me and that's about it.

Not much storage space inside.

Interior styling is dated.

Cup holders won't hold a 20 oz. bottle.

Paint is peeling.

Transmission linkage is weird.  Won't always go into gear the first time.  I was worried about this when it started happening, but it's still going three years later.    

Main Gripe:  Lots of "fit" issues.  It makes lots of little, hard-to-track down noises.  Very irritating.  The speedo is noisy too.  Plastic interior pieces never seem to fit right.
