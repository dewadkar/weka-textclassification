            My wife had a Regal as her company car several years ago.  As an Avis manager, she had her choice of cars, and was able to switch between different cars as often as she pleased.  It was great for us, because we were able to try out a number of different makes and models.  Although we enjoyed her Bonneville, and found the Park Avenue to be a first-class luxury car (although a little to big for our taste), we loved the Regal.

When I was ready for a new car I went to the local buick dealer and left that day with a new 1997 Regal, after the requisite back-and-forth negotiations.  At the time, I lived eight miles from my work, so I wasn't that concerned with fuel efficiency or comfort on trips of long duration.  However, in 1998 we moved to a new home that is 45 miles from my office.  And the Regal has turned out to be a wonderful car for the commute.  I'm in a car pool, and the Regal comfortably fits four passengers, with plenty of leg room in the back seat.  It also gets surprisingly good gas mileage; better than one might expect from a car with a powerful V-6 engine.  But the best feature of all is the smooth ride.  Our local freeways are under constant construction, and the Regal takes the bumps very well.  

When the lease on my '97 expired last year, I shopped around for comparably priced cars from other manufacturers, but ended up leasing another Regal.  And as imitation is the purest form of flattery, one of our car pool members recently purchased a new 2000 Regal.  His model has a moon roof and a mileage computer; nice features that I'd like to include on my next Regal in 2002.
