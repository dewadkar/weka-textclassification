            If you have the money to consider an XKR, you are shouldn't be too concerned about it's impractical aspects (insurance cost, tiny backseat, poor gas mileage).  Despite this, in nice climates this car can be close to an everyday use vehicle without worry.

Maintenance is only required every 10,000 miles...including oil changes.  The transmission is a 100,000 maintenance item.  This all adds up to minimal time wasted at the dealer.

It has a very large gas tank, which is useful considering the below average gas mileage.  However, the gas mileage is reasonable so long as you don't gun it, run it in low gears all the time, and keep the sport mode off.

Of course, every once in awhile you'll want to see what it can do, and it will not disappoint.  The Pirelli P-Zero standard tires really grip the road (but only get 13000-18000 miles depending on how aggresively you drive).  A specialized computer adjusts the suspension and reaction of the steering wheel based on speed in a very natural way - so natural that you won't notice it until you drive another car.

It's highly adjustable seats and high powered stereo system that includes an 8" subwoofer sound great, and make it a pleasure to drive on long trips.

In 18000 miles over a 1.75 year period, I had one mechanical problem - a loose gasket causing a slow transmission fluid drip.  It was repaired under warranty the same day, and I was given a free S-Type rental car by the dealer.
The back seat works for kids, but adults are forced to sit sideways.  And of course, the trunk is ideal for a couple golf bags but not a whole lot more.

The optional GPS system is really great, with many nice features including recently visited address recall and search functions to find the closest bank, grocery store, jaguar dealer, restaurant, and many other points of interest.
