            This is the second Tahoe that I�ve leased, the first one was a 1997 4 Door with everything included and so is this one the 1999.

Since my first test drive of the 1997 Tahoe in November of 1997 I knew that this is finally the one I was looking for and that I will never get bored of it.

Here are just a couple of reasons why I love my Tahoe,

1) When you sit either as the driver or even as the front passenger you�ll feel like you are sitting in your living room, with its high legroom, leather seats and room for a suitcase in front of you.
2) It has enough room in the back that I can hold a nice part of my computer inventory and still have room for my baby carriage when ever its needed.
3) It has room in the back seat for three car seats and an adult.
4) More cup holders, straps, hangers then you�ll ever need.
5) With the 4x4 option you can practically drive into any drive way up hill or down hill in any kind of weather without worrying how you�ll get out, in fact this vehicle is so strong you can pull out cars from ditches with a strong enough chain, I�ve done it many times.

The only drawbacks are,

1) The price is too high, with the sticker price at 36 and change my lease price is at 500 and change.
2) If you drive a lot local and on rough roads this isn�t for you.
3) It eats gas for breakfast lunch and diner especially in the summer with the A/C on.
4) It doesn�t have climate control, which I did have in my old Crown Victoria and I can�t get used to being without it.
