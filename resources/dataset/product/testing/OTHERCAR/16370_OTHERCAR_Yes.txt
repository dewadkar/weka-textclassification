            We wanted a digital camera, but were put off by the prices, until we found the HP Digital camera. With zoom and a clear LCD Viewer, we got more for our money than we thought we could. I would highly recommend this camera for anyone wanting to give digital photography a try. We also purchased the San Disk from HP. This hooks up to our USB so we can just insert the smart disk from the camera to the san disk and have instand access to our pictures on our computer. We have printed several pictures out from the digital, and all have been high quality, just as good as the ones you get developed off a 35mm camera. I cannot imagine we would ever purchase another 35mm camera after using a digital. We can take many shots of the same subject and save the best one. A real plus.<br><br>
