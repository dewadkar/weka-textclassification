About 3 months ago, I bought a 1999 Hyundai Accent GSi to cover my daily commute and as a general means of transportation.  The following is a very detailed review covering nearly every item.

EXTERIOR

While no head-turner like its cousin the Tiburon, the GSi trim makes the regularly plain-looking Accent look fairly decent.  I drove a base model 1999 Accent 'L' before finding the GSi, and the difference in appearance is amazing.   Packing amber fog lights, a rear spoiler, sunroof, and 14" alloy wheels, the Accent GSi appears to be a sporty little economy sports-coupe. 

INTERIOR & COMFORT

Also an improvement over the base model, the Accent GSi packs more standard features than most of its competitors.  A relatively powerful 4-speaker AM/FM/Cassette unit is included, as well as dual front cup-holders, and a leather wrapped steering wheel & gear selector.  Sporty, multi-coloured bucket seats replace the plain gray seats of the base model, and the sun roof is a wonderful addition that helps eliminate claustrophobia.  Other ammenities include a very easy to read dashboard, cloth inserts on the doors, and power locks.  

Comfort-wise, the front seats are fairly comfortable and not too hard on the back.  Unlike some other economy cars, the Accent DOES have adjustable headrests.  Legroom is adequate for most in the front, I am 6'3" and I have just barely enough space for most drives.  Some of my similarly sized passengers will not fit anywhere but the front.  In fact, unless you are 5'5" or shorter, the backseat is not feasible for adult passengers.  When at the wheel, I am comfortable for up to about 90 consecutive minutes on the road before the lack of legroom & seats start to agitate my body.

PERFORMANCE, HANDLING & RIDE

The terms economy-car & subcompact define the expected performance of this car.  Power is excellent for urban excursions but lacking on the freeway.  I usually drive on 2-lane highways anyways, and the car seems best suited in 5th gear between 85-100km/h (55-65mph).  On the freeway (the 401 in Ontario), the posted speed limit is 100km/h, and at that rate, the Accent turns around 3000rpm.  Since very few freeway users travel at the limit, I am usually forced to put the car up at around 115 to avoid being run-down by lead-footed truckers.  At 115km/h(75mph) the 1.5L 4 cylinder engine puts out a very noticeble drone.  The faster you go, the louder the engine gets, but any higher than about 130, the engine sounds like it is working too hard.  My only beef with the engine is that under heavy acceleration, it emits a bit of a "pinging" noise.  This is supposedly a common problem that can be easily fixed, but is no more worrisome than dirt on the wheels.  Also - fuel economy is no Geo Metro, but very good.  A full 40L tank will get me about 500 kilometers (325 miles) of city driving, and costs me about $22cdn.  

Handling is smooth and simple, the tires grip well and even tight turns feel very controlled.  Braking is adequate, but sudden stops could be dangerous as ABS is neither standard or optional.  Acceleration is adequate, although there is little difference between foot halfway & all the way to the floor.  Road noise is only evident at high speeds where wind seeps in through the windows as if they are open a crack.  Being my first car, I think the car is great to drive, but for those who love power, this car is pretty bare-bones.  

RELIABILITY

Although I've only owned this car for 3 months, it is amazing in terms of maintanence and reliability.  Keep the fluids topped-up, change the oil & filter regularly, and don't push it too hard and you're laughing.  I bought my car four years old, and with 73,000 kms on it, and haven't had any problems whatsoever.  Currently it still carries about 8 months/25,000 kms of it's original 5year/100,000k powertrain warranty.  Hyundai is still recovering from its Excel fiasco of the 1980's where their cars hit rock-bottom in reliability, but the newer models like the Accents are gold.  Compared with my friend's '98 Pontiac Sunfire, my '99 Accent may be slower, but has a reliability that most North American subcompacts cannot match.

VALUE

As economy cars go, I would consider the Hyundai Accent to be the best buy out there.  With the Japanese automakers shifting out of the compact-car category, Korean automakers like Hyundai & Kia are able to take ahold of the field.  Compared with the GM Cavalier/Sunfire, the Accent wins in every category except engine performance.  The only other real competitor in price equivalency is the Kia Rio which I have not heard tremendously great things about.  
The 1999's are the last of the 1st generation accents, but the are also one of the most perfected and flawless.  If you don't mind the slightly-outdated styling, the Accent is a great buy.  Not having the time-tested market value of other automakers, Hyundais depreciate greatly after driving off the lot, but this is an advantage to the used car shopper.  You will find a newer, lower mileaged, more reliable Hyundai Accent for about the same price as a Honda Civic that will be four years older, twice as mileaged, and more prone to breakdown.

OVERALL

If you're in the market for a used, small hatchback-coupe, consider the lesser-known Hyundai Accent before jumping for the big name Tercels, Civics, and Sunfires.  You'll find fairly equivalent performance, build quality, good looks, and reliabilty for a considerably more affordable price.  I did, and I'm quite satisfied with my purchase.

Reviewer's note:
Before making my purchase, I read a few mainstream reviews on the Accent (ie: Consumer Reports), but I heavily weighted my decision on the thoughts of Epinions users.  I hope my own review helps others trying to make a decision on whether or not to buy the Hyundai Accent.
