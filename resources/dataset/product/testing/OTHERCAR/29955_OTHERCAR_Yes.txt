            My wife and I were just about to have our first child when we thought it would me most practical to own a van or SUV. We decided to go with Dodge Caravan because it was more practical for family needs (safety devices, room, cost). 
Our Caravan has four doors, a V-6 engine which was a must for me (the husband, and removable seats. 
It is packed with safety features like doors that lock automatically at 15mph, antilock brakes, and door openers that are kid safe and adult friendly. Tilt steering and cruise control are very nice also.
My wife insisted on features like power locks, power windows, and the am/fm cassette. She also liked how the seats are on tracks and can be moved forward, backward, and folded when needed. That back seats even have clips for holding plastic grocery bags. 
Our Caravan drives very smooth and can compete with the speed demons that dominate the roads these days. 
People who are starting families and know they will be taking lots of items on trips are a perfect match for this vehicle.<br><br>
