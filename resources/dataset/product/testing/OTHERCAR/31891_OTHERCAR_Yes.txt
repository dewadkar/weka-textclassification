            Recently I found myself in need of a second car.  One that would get better gas mileage than my gashog of a Suburban- for the short trips and errands I have to run so often.  I was looking for the seemingly impossible combination of:  Dependability, Safety, Low expense (both to buy and maintain) and yes, looks do matter.  I believe I found all, (with the possible exception of one of them-I'll get to that)  in the <b>1992 Oldsmobile Acheiva S</b>.

<b>Description</b>

As far as looks go, I was fortunate that  this one had been well taken care of and was 'clean'.  This, of course is something that will obviously vary from car to car, and not only makes car look good, but can sometimes give an indication as to whether the previous owner was as meticulous about the care of the engine.  The 'S' , though considered a midsize car looks and feels more sporty to me, as it is a small body, 2 door model with bucket seats in the front.  The automatic transmission  has a T-handle floor shifter. 

It has all the extras <i>I</i> need, including a very good air conditioner, heat and a stereo system  (factory, cassette-I said all I <i>need</i>, not <i>want</i>) and the windows are manual-but hey, since when did society get so lazy we can't crank?  I actually like the manual windows as I've had trouble in other vehicles with power windows.

I like the gauges in this car, because they are 'idiot gauges'.  This one has the gas and oil on the same large gauge (top-oil, bottom-gas) and along with the words OIL and GAS are the pictures (an oil spout and a gas pump) that light up when you are low.  (<i>Disclaimer: do not wait until these light up before checking, especially the oil--it's just in case you forget for way too long</i>.)

Ladies: You know how seat belts usually fit?  I know--we can put a man on the moon, but you can't find a seat belt that doesn't smush your boobs...well this one doesn't!  Attached to the door, it comes across the front in such a way that you can either slide it above or below ( I love that).  

I've had this car for over 3 months and I only just discovered this feature.  If you've ever been behind a vehicle that had their turn signal on for 30 miles you know how annoying it can be.  Worse is when you realize you are <i>that </i> vehicle!  If you haven't made a turn after a short period of time with your blinker on, you hear a 'dinging' very similar to the sound you hear when your door has been left open.  This means: turn or turn off your turn signal!

<b>The Engine and Drivetrain</b>

This car has a 4 cylinder, 2.3 liter engine,  automatic transmission, and front wheel drive.  I have yet to have problems with anything on this car.  Again, how a car is cared for by the previous owner is going to have a lot of bearing here, and if you are like me-not knowledgeable about cars it is always best to have someone look over the motor for you.  This one was clean, doesn't burn oil, and handles very well.  After three months I was so pleased that I decided to take it on a long trip to Arkansas.  Again, no problems at all.  The gas mileage is better than what I'd hoped for.  The best I can tell, I got somewhere between 25-27  miles per gallon.

<b>Safety</b>

This is where the other shoe comes down, but unfortunately it's a pretty big shoe.  Only after making this purchase did I do any in depth research on the safety aspects of this car.  Given the year model, I didn't expect air bags or any of the more recent safety features, but <i>AutoGiant</i> has a site (http://www.autogiant.com) that gives statistics for crash tests on automobiles.  Looking up mine, I was disappointed to find that while the passenger side of the vehicle gets 5/5 stars for crash safety, the driver's side gets only 1.  I felt the need to add this information because safety is a very important aspect of buying this or any car.  My advice would be to avoid crashes if at all possible.

This is a good back-up vehicle, a solid car that I've found to be more than adequate for my needs.   I had thought to recommend it as a good starter car, but in light of the safety information I think with new drivers this would-or should be an area of real concern.  <br><br>
