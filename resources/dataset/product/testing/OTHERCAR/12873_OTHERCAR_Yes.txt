            I did...I was in an accident - side-swiped by two young boys out to get a buck while I was in my 1993 J30.  Having a bad back - my first reaction was 'did I get hurt?'.  I didn't.  The J30 saved me.  I walked away without any injuries..except that of a broken heart.  So what did I do?  To much ridicule by friends and family - I went out and bought the same car - again!  I did buy a newer (1997) version (which was the year they stopped the design of the J30).  I figured - why buy a different car when I loved mine so much, and when it protected me when I needed it most.  It's a beautiful car.  Extremely smooth ride.  The leather seats are so comfortable, my only complaint is once I get it - I have a hard time getting back out.  The steering and breaking are both smooth.  The rear-wheel drive is not my first choice, but you don't buy an Infiniti to go up to the snow anyway!  The noise is virtually non-existent when you close the doors and sit inside.  It's like the old commercial...all the outside noise is stopped dead-silent when  you are inside the Infiniti J30.   The Bose stereo system is perfection.  I actually laughed at having a 'seat warmer' which was not included in my '93 J30, but when I get in my car to go to work and it's below 30 outside - I use it!  This is a luxury car - among luxury cars.  I have heard complaints that the back seat is on the small side - but I've never rode back there. I do hope Infiniti decides to bring this design back.  It is very unique.  Not the standard shape of every other car out on the road.  Why they stopped in '97 - I don't know.  People have asked me - since I have such a great car now - what will I 'move up' into?  My only answer?  I'll just keep buying the same car!
