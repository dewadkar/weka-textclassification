            I am the proud owner of a <b>Saturn SC 2</b> now, the 1999 two door version (no, not virgin).  My car has all the accoutrements, bells and whistles.  You can read about my current vehicle if you wish.  I happened to catch a spunky, sporty, classy little <b>Saturn SC2</b> for 2001 the other day, and I immediately felt my heart race.  I was totally out of control; I had to go and take a test drive, and find out how soon I could, uh, upgrade my car.

The sales consultant, <b>Andre Thompson</b>, at the <b>Saturn</b> dealership located at 5850 Centinela Ave in Los Angeles, California, was very knowledgeable, warm, nice, and helpful.  <b>Saturn</b> sales professionals in my opinion are exactly that.  They are honest, open, no threats, no worries, they are there to help.  As a single woman, I don�t enjoy being reduced to tears in car dealerships, and worries about being manipulated, lied to.  That is why I shall always go to <b>Saturn</b>.  I trust them, and I am comfortable with them.  There is a dealership about 20 miles away from me (NOT Saturn) recently highlighted on the news for cheating customers out of a lot of money.  I don�t worry about that with <b>Saturn</b>.  It is �shark-free".  I also am not really great in math, and with <b>Saturn</b> they are not going to play with numbers to confuse those math-challenged.  There is no haggling.  You can however negotiate the trade-in if applicable, and sometimes they will have a demo model or buy-back where you can work a little with the cost.  

By the same token, I didn�t play games, I told  Andre straight out that I may be upside down on my vehicle now, but am definitely interested in the 2001 if not right now,  not too long down the line.  I love the sleek, sexy, look of the car.  When I first saw the 3-door model I wasn�t sure of my feelings.  It looked funny to me, and I thought, well, my kids are grown, I don�t need that door.  Time has gone by, and I now think it is fantastic.  I do have groceries and other purchases, and my 14 year old chow chow Kuma gets miffed when he has to wait for me to put the seat back. So the third door allows for easy loading and unloading, whether it is sports equipment, groceries, camping gear, a dog or two, spouse or mother in law, it is very simple to do.
 
<b>Appearance</b>:

Dent corrosion resistant polymer panels (someone dings your car, rub it out)

Wraparound tail lights, heat repelling solar glass

Seating fits you like a glove; I have the lumbar support in my present car, and shall always get a vehicle with that extra, but the seats adjust for height, adjust backwards and forward.  I love the way it adheres.

Console armrest on the 2001 slides back and forth, to fit elbows and forearms of all sizes.  You can also store your CD�s, cassettes and pocket change.  The gauges are all conveniently located so they are easily within your reach.  

I find it more state of the art in appearance than my 1999. The 60/40 split folding rear seats are great even for skiis.  The seats lock in place.

Cup holders, okay a little thing, but important to me.  My 1999 has four cup holders and only accommodates the smaller cups; the 2001 has 6 cup holders, and they will accommodate the larger size cups.  They are in both the back and front.

The vehicle I was looking at, and took a test drive in was a very pretty champagne/gold color (they call it gold, but it is more subtle than that in my opinion).  It also comes in a hot sporty red, a pale silver, black, blue, white, green.  Cloth or leather interior comes in black, gray, or tan depending on the exterior.    

One tiny difference I don't like as much is the spoiler in the back.  It is very subtle and built into the rear, rather than jutting out.  It prefer that it juts out a bit, as it looks sportier, but others may prefer it this way.

<b>The drive</b>:

I was excited to drive this car.  It was fun, maneuvered smoothly and efficiently. I found that the noise level inside the car was quieter than my 1999 vehicle (although even that doesn't disturb me.  The acceleration was speedier.  Oh I just loved driving this car.  I am very fortunate that I really enjoy my present car, or I would have been devastated walking away from that little dream car.

<b>What did I like about the 2001</b>:

I love the sleek, sexy, classy look.  It looks a lot more expensive than it really is.  I like the little changes they have made, the headlights, the display, the extra airbags for additional security.  I am happy they have added more and bigger cup holders, the seats seem a little wider than my 1999, but the car I drove had cloth seats and mine has leather, so it might have been the feel which was different.  While I was previously ambivalent about the third door thinking it would be a problem, I now see what an asset it can be.  You are benefiting by the extra door, and yet you maintain the hot, sporty appearance.  What more could you ask for?  The stereo sounds wonderful.    The mileage is very good, and if you are up for the manual in lieu of automatic, of course it would be improved further. The optional head curtain airbags are appealing as an excellent safety feature and I would think worth the extra money.  Due to the construction of these vehicles it is very difficult to damage them, therefore the insurance is considerably less than most other vehicles.  My insurance has never been so low.  The lumbar seats are great for anyone, but particularly for those with any back problems.  The stereo takes you away from all your problems. . .

<b>Dislikes</b>:

There was nothing really I disliked.  I still wish they would widen the seats in the car as they do not accommodate broader built people.  The air conditioning both on my car and the car we drove are okay, but not as cold as I would like.  I was hoping they would improve on that.  Granted I turn the a/c on if it is over 70 degrees, but it seems it has to be turned up extremely high to work as I would like.

<b>Other things to know</b>

Bumper to bumper warranty 3 years/36,000 miles whichever comes first

24 hour roadside assistance (I still have my Auto Club, but obviously don't need it).  The owner can just dial 
1/800-553-6000 and Saturn will arrange towing or provide assistance as needed.

<b>Money-Back Guarantee</b>:

Thirty day or 1500 miles, the original purchaser may return
the vehicle for any reason for exchange or full refund.  I obtained my 1999 when the previous owner returned the vehicle with 1300 miles on it.  the car is dark blue.  He decided after 1300 miles that blue was not his color.  He exchanged it for another color and Suzi got a great deal.

<b>Final thoughts</b>:

I highly recommend the <b>Saturn SC2, 2001</b> for its phenomenal look, reasonable cost, reduced insurance cost, handling, drive.  If you are very tall or broad, or have a passenger who is very tall or broad, take that into consideration before purchasing the car.  Check it out. I think it looks quite similar to the Acura Integra, and also in a less pretentious way, the Mitsubishi Eclipse, yet it is a lot less expensive to purchase, maintain, exemplary customer service, the <b>Saturn</b> name. They provide one way shuttle service for your car maintenance if you are reasonably close by.  They also wash your car for you following the servicing. 

I understand that for a brief time there is an extremely low interest rate available for the 2001, but of course that is on approved credit.  Don�t you hate it when they add that in miniscule print? If my memory serves me they said it is 0.9, so if you are interested, act now.  Some of you may be concerned that I don't actually own this vehicle.  Well the vehicle I do own is extremely close to it, and I plan on purchasing this car in the near future.  There are enough similar features to review this car, and enough differences to justify a review on the 2001 also.

The <b>Saturn</b> website is http://www.saturn.com.  If you wish to contact Andre in the Los Angeles dealership, his phone number is 310/645-6868.  Their web page in Los Angeles is surprisingly, http://www.SaturnLA.com.

I highly recommend this car for most people.  I give it a 4.5 out of possible 5

Thanks for reading!
