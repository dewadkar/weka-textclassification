            I have to admit that I sway towards American cars.  When I was looking for a new car to replace my Grand Am, I went to look at the new Grand Ams first.  I thought they looked a bit tacky with their over-done styling, compared to my 98 model.

I had always heard that Saturns were fun, reliable cars, so I went to one of the Saturn dealerships in Indianapolis, and took one for a test drive.

When I saw the car it kind of looked like a more expensive Passat, with its clean styling, and simple interior.  The doors even have that satisfying German "thunk" when they're closed.  The love em or hate em plastic panels are dent resistant, but they can leave large gaps in the body work due to the shrinking and expanding properties of plastic as opposed to metal.

I got the L300 V6 with every option aside from the rear seat DVD player.  The leather seats dress up the somewhat bland interior.  There are the usual cheap GM plastics inside, but they're not as bad as some.  The chrome wheels are kind of ugly, and I wish that the standard alloys were available with the Premium model, but they are not.  The radio and climate controls are all easy to operate, and the car has been trouble free.

The V6 is powerful, but not as refined as other GM models.  The car rides nicely, and is fairly quite for this price range.  Braking is decent, and smooth.  I just wish that the V6 was available with a manual.  Since the V6 is from the foreign Opel brand, it is best suited for the manual as opposed to the auto.  The auto isn't bad though.

Purchasing a Saturn is a rewarding experience.  The sales staff is extremely friendly, and not pushy.  With rebates and the occasional 0% financing, I think the Saturn L series a pretty good alternative to some Ford and Toyota brands.
