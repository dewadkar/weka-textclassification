            For the serious photographer, consumer level digital cameras have lacked adequate control over the details. Most consumer digital cameras provide no manual focus, and no shutter/aperture control. Of those that do, the controls are clunky and impractical.

Minolta has held an unchallenged niche with the high-end "prosumer" digital cameras... An affordable upper-end consumer camera with most of the features of the professional models. For those wishing to spend around $1000 for a complete high-end camera, there is no competition.

The Dimage 7hi is the third, and latest incarnation of the Dimage 7 series.

*With 5.2 megapixel resolution, the photos will easily print to 8x10 and even 16x20 resolution.

*The built-in 28-200mm lens system allows for distortion free wide-angle panoramic scenes, all the way to tight telephoto shots. There is no chromatic or spherical abberation. The 49mm diameter lens is threaded to accomodate filters and accessory lenses.

*The zoom is manually controlled with a rubberized ring around the lens. This will be comfortable for anyone who has used an SLR camera in the past. The mechanism is much more responsive than the W-T toggles found on most cameras. It also avoids the need for extra battery power to be wasted on a motor.

*Macro photography is easy, in either the 200mm or 28mm mode. The crisp detail of even tiny objects will impress you.

*Manual focus is accomplished with another ring. Although this is a focus-by-wire system, it does permit very fine control of the focus. The LCD screen and viewfinder can magnify the image 4x to ensure the sharpest focus.

*By default, the camera uses a very sophisticated auto-focus and auto-exposure system to easily capture sharp images. These settings may all be bypassed, however, and the user has full control of white-balance, contrast, sharpness, saturation, shutter-speed, aperture, as well as color-filters.

* Aperture ranges from 2.8 to 9.5 in preset steps.
* Shutter-speed may be as fast as 1/2000, and as slow as 8-30 seconds. Bulb mode is also supported for long exposures with a remote shutter release cable (not included)

* Noise reduction is impressive, particularly with long exposures. The camera compares the photo with an image against closed shutter to remove most of the noise detected by the CCD. This makes low-light photography a true possibility!

* The camera controls are positioned for convenience, and are easy to learn.
