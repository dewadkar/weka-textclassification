            This is the car your mother warned you about. Sure it�s based on old design, and it�s ugly, but is also very fast.

Styling is subjective, sort of like favorite colors. Some people love pink, others hate it.  The Firebird T/A WS6 is so ugly and garish, it is the only car that can make a Camaro SS look subtle.  Surely there are many people who think the WS6 is nothing less than a rolling work of art. The good thing is that all those ugly scoops, bulges and odd angles are actually functional.  Nothing is worse than a  car with a hood scoop that was added for no other reason than someone thought it looked cool.  The rear of the car is equally unattractive with a rear deck spoiler and strange looking honeycomb like tail-lights.

Inside, the WS6 looks to have an interior from a 10 year old car. Oddly placed switchgear, and a stereo with those tiny graphic equalizer sliding buttons all conspire to remind one that this car�s roots are firmly planted in the 1980s. However the stereo sounds better than average. The seats are fairly comfortable at first, but seat time of 2 hours or more really takes its toll. Seating space is cramped for both driver and passengers.  If you are under 5� 10� (as many of the owners of these cars are),  you won�t feel so cramped. There are only 2 items in the interior of this car that really matter: The shifter and the steering wheel mounted radio controls.  The WS6 gives you a Hurst short throw shifter, and rowing the gears is nothing less than fun.  The shifter is well placed and does its job with near perfection.  This car requires all the driver�s attention so those steering wheel mounted audio controls will come in handy.  A car that is this fun to drive needs a little background music, with the WS6 you can have it without ever taking your eyes off the road.

Driving the WS6 is not for rookies, this is a serious car.  Despite its appearance and reputation as a car bought only by losers, the WS6 is a very powerful car.  Besides, not many losers I know can afford $35,000 for a new car (they all drive black 1988 Trans Ams with one headlight always flipped up and a dangling exhaust system).  Pontiac claims 305 hp for a regular T/A.  That�s nothing to sneeze at, a 5.7 liter, 305 hp V-8 in a mid size car will really make it go.  The WS6 gets bigger exhaust, forced induction (ram-air) and a less restrictive air cleaner.  The 2001 WS6 is good for a ground pounding 320 hp.  Rumor has it that GM purposely underestimates the power of this car because they don�t want anyone to consider the WS6 a faster car than the Corvette -seriously, the Firebird is no Vette.  The Chevrolet Corvette makes an impressive 350 hp.  

On the road the WS6 rides a little rough due to the performance oriented suspension.  The six-speed manual is well suited to both city and highway driving, although stop and go traffic is not were this car shines.  Running through the gears in the WS6 will surely bring a smile to the face of anyone who likes the power and sound of a dual exhaust V-8.  This Pontiac is crude and unrefined � in short this car is the automotive schoolyard bully and it will stomp every Mustang, Civic/Integra, and old, jacked up Nova within a 10 mile radius (hopefully there are no Cobra Rs in those 10 miles). Even mild stabs at the accelerator put you back in your seat.

There is a downside to all this power.  Driving the WS6 on a daily basis can be a bit taxing.  While the exhaust note is perfect in its brutishness, it gets old for anyone who is used to a more quiet or modern car. This is especially true for the convertible.  The clutch is heavy (as it should be) and commuter traffic can be a downright pain in the leg.  Also a hassle is how much attention the driver must pay during everyday driving.  This car has the nerve racking combination of high power and poor visibility, it'seven worse in the convertible.  The view outward is hindered by the low roof line and thick C pillar.  Changing lanes is a daunting task.  By the end of the day, I felt tired.  Sure, the occasional romp down an open back road, chirping rubber in 1st, 2nd and 3rd gear make it well worth it, but most people need more from a car.  

Handling is fair, but should be better for a car with such a sporting image.  There is minimal body roll, but the steering feels vague at higher speeds.  Expect a few squeaks and creaks when traveling on rough roads.  Finally, if you are looking for a car with decent fuel economy, keep looking. Buy this car and you�ll swear there is a hole in the gas tank. 

Overall the Firebird T/A WS6 is not a great everyday car.  Only those who want to go fast and be noticed should consider this when shopping for a new car.
