            I write this review speaking as a 4'11" female mother of one.  My child rides backseat, center, in a car seat.  What does this mean?  What I can tell you in this review is that the vehicle suits the needs of an entire family (like mine)perfectly, and why.  

My Honda CRV is gold in color (barely shows dirt), all wheel drive (GREAT for those living in areas that tend to have inclement weather), and a special edition (SE) model.  This vehicle offers a smooth ride and is a pleasure to drive.

When choosing the Honda CRV as a main vehicle for my family, we opted for the special edition version, mainly because we were interested in leather seating and tinted windows.  These features come standard on the 2001 SE CR-V. I will address those features first.  

The leather seats are durable and stain resistant.  I was initially concerend that with the weight of a carseat, we would be in for trouble in terms of wear and tear.  Not a problem.  Obviously a high quality leather, we have had no problems with wear and tear on our seats (this is great as my CR-V is a leased vehicle).

I found the tinted windows on the SE CR-V to be mainly aesthetic in purpose.  The 2 back windows are tinted in this model.  They do not block the sun from the eyes of my toddler in the back seat.  For parents with children, plan on keeping your "car shade" for windows if you opt for this model CR-V.

Size.  I find the size of this SUV absolutely perfect for my needs.  I am petite, and never imagined driving comfortably in a SUV.  When I first noticed other CR-V models on the road, I became interested based on the "smaller" look of them in comparison to the competition.  I am very comfortable driving this vehicle.  The seats adjust to fit both myself and my husband (he is over a foot taller than me).  

The roominess in the back of the vehicle is definitely appropriate for families like mine, always traveling with a stroller and toys.  I fit my groceries on top of the "regular" traveling gear - no problem.  As for seating, we fit 5 comfortably including the carseat.  The seats do fold down, for added space.  The 2001 CR-V comes equipped with a picnic table hidden in the "trunk"...I was truly impressed with this feature when my sales person revealed it to me!

I love the all wheel drive feature on my CR-V.  Driving in moderate snow falls is no longer a huge concern.  And, I do not find that I spend much in gas to support this feature.  (I spend about $20.00 per week in gas, driving moderate amounts usually within my home town).

Other features:  My 2001 CR-V came with a CD player which I use daily without fail.  I also find great radio reception in this vehicle. 

The 2 rear view mirrors on the sides of this vehicle tilt inward, allowing for better access to tight squeezes.  I find this helpful for getting my car into my garage without damaging the mirrors.

In this model, you'll find plenty of cup holders, an adjustable arm rest for the driver, and "slots" behind each front seat to place maps, toys or other supplies.  There's plenty of space to store standard "car" items.

I change the oil in my CR-V every 3000 miles and have had no serious mechanical issues arise.  I have leased this vehicle for over a year to date.  We chose to lease to make the vehicle more affordable, but are strongly considering a purchase option at the end of the lease.
