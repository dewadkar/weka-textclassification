             Two days ago my finace, Terry, bought me a 1999 Chevy Cavalier Z24, and I am in love with the car (already loved the man). The odometor reads 36,784 and the engine is clean and this car was extremely well kept. This particular model is the sporty 2 door Z24, it has a 2.4 liter twin cam engine, 5 speed, and it has a wonderful factory built in theft deterrent system. 

            Additional Features Include: 
 Moon Roof

 Power Doors

 Power Windows

 ABS

 Cruise Control

 Factory AM/FM cassette stereo

 Dual Airbags

 Fog Lights

 RPM Guage

 Air Bag

 As far as handling goes, this car is excellent. I have driven it both in the city and on the highway and the ride is smooth and the car is quiet. It really has the power to "get up and go" when you need it to, such as merging onto the highway, etc. The steering is tight and it is a well built machine. This car handles excellent on sharp curves.

 One of my favorite features is the light that comes up when it is time to shift gears, so you don't even have to pay attention to the RPM guage, and so that is a useful little plus that I am pleased with. The clutch is very good as you barely have to push it in to shift gears and the gear shift itself is easy to shift through gears, much easier than the 2000 Mazda Protege, which I used to own.

 I haven't got to figure the gas mileage, yet, since I just got this car two days ago, but I am pleased with what I have seen so far. As, I have driven this car ALL over for the past two days and have only used a 1/4 tank of gas.

 The breaks are excellent for stopping in an emergency and it is a smooth breaking system. I have driven this car on both dry and wet roads and the breaks have been an asset on both conditions.

 The engine is quiet and has power. This particular car, is the sporty Z24 and so the engine is a little bigger than the regular Cavaliar model, and I highly suggest that given the choice that you should definately check out the Z24 versus the traditional Cavalier.

 This is a two door and it is quite roomy. The front has bucket seats which are large and roomy. The back seat is average size and seats my two 5 year olds and 4 year old quite comfortably. They have extra room so I have not heard, "Mom, so and so is bothering me and not giving me room." 

 The trunk space is fairly large and I am quite happy with the trunk space available. The back seat can also be laid down to provide extra trunk space if needed to haul a large load home, such as from the lumber store, etc. 

 The enterior of the car is beautiful. Mine is grey with a mix of grey and red tweed on the seat itself. The moon roof button is a little tricky and takes some practice. The power window control is located on the console. One of my favorite features is that the small compartment's door on the console folds completely back to provide a cup holder for someone that is seated in the back seat. The air conditioner works very well, I had the temperature level set at high yesterday and in a matter of two minutes it was freezing inside my car despite the 93 degree heat outside. 

 The only two complaints that I have about this car is that it has no ashtray, I've never seen this in a car before and in this model an ashtray is an option. But, if you're not a smoker than this should not be a problem for you. The second, is that since this is a sports car the insurance is higher, infact my monthly insurance payment is higher than my monthly car payment and I have a spotless driving record, as I've never had a ticket before.

 I love my new black 1999 Chevy Cavalier Z24, it is an awesome looking sports car. The look is actually a cross between a traditional Cavaliar and a Camaro. For the two days that I have owned it so far I have gotten several comments on how beautiful the car is, even from the drive thru person at McDonald's. Overall the car is excellent on all factors and it's quite sytlish. I would highly recommend anyone in the market for a used late model Cavaliar to test drive the Z24. It's a great machine and quite roomy for a car in the sports car category.

 Vroom Vroom, if you are in the Sand Springs, Oklahoma area and see an 1999 black Chevy Cavalier Z24 pull up beside you chances are it's me, so honk twice and say hello.
