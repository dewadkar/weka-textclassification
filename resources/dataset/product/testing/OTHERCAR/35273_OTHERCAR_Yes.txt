            We bought our Montero with 56K on the odometer and have since put another 65K miles on it.  I didn't really check out all of the alternative SUVs in this class -- we wanted something with seating for seven and were anti-minivan and the Montero seemed to fit the bill at a price we could afford, but as one point of comparison, I looked at Toyota Land Cruisers of similar vintage, and I was surprised by how well the Montero stacks up in terms of roominess, comfort, equipment levels, and interior finish.  My wife drives it the most and she loves it -- it's roomy, very well equipped, and sits way up high.  I find it a little scary to drive -- it's probably the worst handling vehicle I've ever owned, but it doesn't bother her a bit -- she drives it like a sports car.  It's excellent in bad weather -- we don't really do any heavy off-road driving but it's very confidence-inspiring in the snow and ice with the locking differentials.  It has also been very reliable with a couple of (expensive) exceptions: 1) it's very hard on brakes and tires, especially brakes.  I just spent $625 redoing the brakes that had last been done six months ago.  We do live on a hill and drive more miles than average, but this is a heavy truck and I've heard other people have similar experiences.  We've also spent a lot on emission control problems.  We've only had to service it twice for that but it's been expensive -- I don't know if this is typical but it has four oxygen sensors which can cost up to $500 each to replace.
