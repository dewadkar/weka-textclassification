            The Acura TL is impressive.  After owning many Hondas, in 1988 I bought a Legend Coupe, manual (had to order it).  After 160K miles, minimal minor repairs (speedometer cable, etc.) and timely maintenance, wind and road noise are the only areas which seem to have bowed to Father Time.  I really want another Legend, a 2000 model: The RL is supposed to be the Legend's standard bearer, but it looks like a poor copy of the Lexus (which in turn looks like an equally poor, larger copy of the '78 Toyota Corona.) 

My heart had shifted toward a 328 BMW, which I came within $500 of buying (at $39K)-yet BMW was not willing to negotiate.  Although this would've been our second sedan, my wife could not see paying that much for such a small car.  In comes the TL- WOW!  Raving reviews, by owners, professionals, consumer advocates, and foreign press ...and to top it all, outstanding good looks.  After struggling with color options (what we liked, we had had and were tired of those colors).  Then we saw this &quot;Laguna Green Metallic&quot; at the Houston Auto Show and our minds were made up. -In fact, my brother was with us and he was so impressed he bought a black one right there!  We had to wait for 5 weeks for it, but it was worth it.  Great car, smooth ride, all the things I loved about my Legend are here--just more luxury and comfort!  

If you travel a lot, like we do, get the Nav system. It's also great finding locations around town. Is it worth $2K--well, some people put more than that on spoilers--it's personal taste, but if you can afford it, I highly recommend it. A map will never tell you where you are in the middle of the Arizona desert or where the next Motel is when you are driving in the dark, wooded highways of the northeast -the TL Nav system will.   

Just about everything one would want a luxury vehicle to do.  

One complaint: Too many cars look alike today--altho the TL has unique looks now, its front grille (borrowed from the old CL) is being copied by too many other cars, including Solara, the new Odyssey, and knowing Honda, in a few years by the Accord and the rest of the Honda family.

P.S. If this is Wal-Mart price as some say, why don't I ever see any Acura TLs parked there?  --Lot's of Pontiacs, tho...<br><br>
