            I purchased this truck because I wanted to buy a truck camper. I drove various pick-up models for 42 years as a construction worker. The Diesel engine has enough power to climb the mountains on US 75 through Kentucky and Tennessee with camper loaded without downshifting. The interior is well appointed and very comfortable. The power drivers seat is great with its adjustable lumbar support. I recommend the 8 foot box as this will give you the best ride. This truck rides good empty but with a load I would put it up against any sedan. The only bad thing I have found is you must put up with the Diesel noise. The engine will smooth out above 45 mph. If you want a pick-up with lots of power for pulling or hauling, this is the truck for you.<br><br>
