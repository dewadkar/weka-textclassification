            Do you know the Canon S300? Well the Canon S330 is a upgraded version of the S330. The 330 is similar; however, it is newer. When the S330 came out it was priced cheaper than the S300. The S330 can shoot up to 1600x1200. It has a 3x optical/2.5x digital (7.5x total) zoom. It comes with a battery charger and 8mb CF card. Also comes with a carrying strap, software, cables, and everything you need to get it running. 

The S330 is that its 99% steel. The only part that is plastic is the battery cover. It has "My Camera" feature. It lets you customize the startup sound and picture. Also the Canon S330 differs from the S300 with more features. The S330 lets you change your ISO mode. Also it has a built in speaker so when you record in movie mode and playback with the sound. These are just some of the features. In movie mode you record movies up to 320x160. 

Anyways this is an excellent compact camera. I can fit it in my pocket easily. It is also a good camera for beginners or advance photographers. It has auto mode or manual mode. With a click of a button your picture takes. Now for picture quality. The picture is beautiful and clear. One of the best 2mp digital camera. It you can take your pictures in different with different effects. Also you can take panoramic pictures and stitch it together with the software given. The interface is easy to understand and use.

The only thing I dont like about this camera is that it comes with a 8mb compact flash card. However, compact flash cards are cheap these day. Other than that I enjoy using this camera.
