            I had test-driven other minivans including 2003 Sienna and Odyssey before making up my decision.  The Odyssey is "odd" in driving experience.  I couldn't tell if it was hitting a bump, I felt so isolated; it felt just like sitting in anyone's grand-dad's car!!  However, they may be good for older people.

The Sienna's acceleration and handling felt better than the Odyssey.  Yet, the front bumper looked very old-fashioned to me, and the small 15 inch not alloys, huh, aren't sporty looking anymore.  Forget it.

Finally, I test-drove the MPV LX sand metallic, it was love at first sight.  The color, the interior, the alloy wheels, the sporty look caught my eyes first.

The test-drive confirmed me that it was the most nimble of the group of 3 minivans comparo.  It provides the best handling, the best acceleration feel, the best braking with the ABS and electronic brake force distribution EBD standard.  

It's ability to carry up to 8 people have been proven by me taking 7 passengers besides me.  I do not feel the second row and third row seats as small.  They feel very good sizes to me and they are all supportive and provide a lot of comfort.  

So far, I have averaged between 18.9 mpg to 20.3 mpg mixed city and freeway driving.  My best mpg was 22.75 mpg, my worst was the first tank 17.3 mpg right after purchase.  

So far, I have been owning the MPV for less than three months, and I am loving it more everyday.  There has been no problem to my uncle's 1997 MPV so far, therefore, I do not expect that there will be any problem to mine either as expected of Mazda's quality.

I carry my bikes with me in the van, carry friends and family for long and short trips, I love my MPV minivan wagon.  This is the only one that lets you ZOOM by other minivans !!!!
