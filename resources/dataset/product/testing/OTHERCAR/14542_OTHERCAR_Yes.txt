            The car was given to me in rather poor condition, the only maintenance done to it was when it needed it.  I looked at it and realized it's potential, so I took it.  I cleaned it up and began to modify it.  It looked horrible when i got it, oxidized paint, no hub caps, almost bleached vinyl.  So I took it upon myself to fix it.  I fixed the paint and vinyl for about $30 dollars (Meguirs wax and Mothers back to black).  I purchased a set of rims to add to the cars new found beauty.  The car looks brand new (everyone thought i got a new car), I've had offers for $4,500 based on pictures only.  The car rides incredibly smooth, i haven't had to put a dime into it except for when i want to.  You can see the car at www.geocities.com/conlinj it has alot better pictures than the black and white one.  Aslo check out www.geocities.com/protegetech for more cars from the protege liniage
