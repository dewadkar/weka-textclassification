            PROS: Fast V6 car with this manual transmission. This car is a great head turner. It handles decently. It has great traction even in snow, if you know what you are doing and use 2nd gear often. It has plenty of cargo space if you have up to two people in the car. It is cheap to own. And most of all it was a bargain to buy new. After all the rebates I paid 18K for this car. A real bargain for a 200HP sports car. 

CONS: That rear suspension is old. It prevents high speed (100MPH+) cruising from being safe and it allows for some scares when cornering over bumps. Ths inside is a little tight. Especially for the front passenger. The gear box is really harsh. No smooth AUDI/BMW box here. In long trips the seats become uncomfortable.
