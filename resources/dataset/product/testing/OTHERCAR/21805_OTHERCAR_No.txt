            Hey, this van looks pretty good (as far as a van goes) and meets a family's needs.  Reliability problems have soured my experience with the Trans Sport.  With 28K miles the transmission (rebuilt)  and power steering have been replaced, 3 leaking headlamps have been replaced, going on second noisy vent fan, brakes have been replaced and the van has been in 6 times for door and window rattles and leaks.  It truly is amazing that for $28K Pontiac can only agree that there is a rattle problem and I will be notified when/if a solution arrives......  The radio unit has been out for repair, the arm rests readjusted, the battery died and the van had to be towed ...
