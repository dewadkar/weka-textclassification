            This camera is possibly the worst camera I have wasted money on.It looked to be a good idea to have it function as more than just a camera,but it doesn't even function well as a start.

There is no preview window on the camera,as on most digital camera's,so make sure you know that you're photo is going to be good when it's taken.When you do take a picture,don't be in a big hurry to take another,as it takes at least 5 seconds before you can take another because of it's sluggish save time,or shutter lag,if you like.

It is also a very hard camera on batteries,so rechargeable ones are advised.When uploading mp3's be prepared to wait a while,and only one mp3 can be deleted at a time.

But possibly the worst for me is the poor quality software.When installed,there's a good possibility that you're camera will not be recognoised at all,so you can't upload your pictures to your computer.I have just reinstalled windows xp pro on a 2.4gb AMD processor,and when I installed this software,My camera could not be found.Lots of tweaking necessary to get it going.

My advice,stay well away from the Samgsung Digimax35/mp3
