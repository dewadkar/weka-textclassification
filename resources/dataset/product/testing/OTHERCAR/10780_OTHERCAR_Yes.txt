            We had a 1 yr. lease on a black Suburban in 1998, and had no doubts about entering a 3 yr. lease for another 1999 one, this time in Pewter.  We checked out other SUV's, minivans, etc. but just couldn't do it!  When we leased our first one, they told us at the dealer that, &quot;You know what they say about Suburbans? Once you own one, you'll always have to have one!&quot;  They were right! We drove to Florida this past summer and had plenty of room for our kids and luggage.  The kids were extremely comfortable with their TV/VCR set up and plenty of leg room.  Once my husband was able to fit in a full size piece of plywood, he was sold!

The Suburban handles wonderfully.  It has good pick-up and a great turning radius.  It drives like a car; you don't feel that you are driving such a large vehicle.  I'm only 5'2&quot; and I have no problem driving it, so for any other small persons I have this to say - Take one for a test drive before you think it will be too big to drive. It isn't!  You'll love sitting up high, and when in a car after, you'll feel like you're sitting on the ground.

We've never had to take either one of our Suburbans in for service! They are very reliable.

One warning though - with all that room, you'll always be the one to drive for group outings!!!<br><br>
