            The Honda CRX. Just by the name "CRX" you can picture something sporty; at least i could. Summer of 01: I'd been searching and searching for one of these suckers and come across a beautiful Tahetian Green Si. No rust (which is rare for a CRX up north), paint was great and mileage was low (107,000K) for a Honda that is nothing. I got it and immediately knew what i had bought. This is not your ordinary car. This little car gets stares everywhere you go. In my opinion this is Honda's best looking car ever. Only 2200lbs and the 108 HP 1.6 SOHC engine. Japan got the 1.6 DOHC - 135HP. The DOHC would have been much nicer than the 1.6 sohc. Handling of this car is superb, take hard turns and you won't hear any complaints. Acceleration was pretty good, since the engine doesn't have much weight to pull, it accelerates rather quickly. I didn't want to dump much money into performance parts so i just got an intake and an exhaust. If you plan on racing it , expect mid 16s in the 1/4. To make this car insanely fast drop in about $1000 for a b16 (1.6 DOHC VTEC 160HP) engine and you'll be in the low 15s high 14s. Back to the car, the reliability was typical honda reliability, excellent. Only problems i had in the 6 months of ownership were 1 Rear wheel cylinder and fuel pump. Both were minor repairs if you could do it your self. The interior is nicely designed and all the instruments face the driver. The only downside of this car is if you are driving at night, every punk stops next to you at the light and wants to race. IF you can handle that than buy this car , otherwise , if you don't like attention then seek other cars. I highly reccomend this car to people who like sporty 2 seaters. I've read reviews comparing this car toa Geo Storm , this is preposterous, where are all the geo storms now? in the junkyard most likely. Anyway this is a great over all car. Moonroof is standard on the Si as is a manual transmission (automatic on DX only) no power steering but that aides in handling so it's better without. Good luck.
