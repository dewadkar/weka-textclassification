            Hey guys, here I am typing up my review and I cant help but keep staring out the window to look at my car.  Once you test drive this car you will agree with me that it's a lot like a Lexus, after all Toyota makes Lexus.  I have the SLE V6 model pretty much fully loaded.  I financed it and its coming out to be around 28 grand.  I bought this vehicle for many reasons I was also in the market for a 3 series BMW and pretty much the only difference between a BMW and this is that BMW has a lot more wood, and that wood also takes big bites out of your wallet as well.  This car has great power.  Not so great in the low gears but after you pass 40 M.P.H.  the response is almost instantaneous.  If you are one those people who love to hear the engine roar don�t get this car, because the great stereo and the quite ride will not please you.  I have only noticed one problem so far and its not very serious at all.  I am average height 5,6' and the I forgot what they are called the stuff that block the sun from your eyes, I�ll just call them sun shades, well any who they are way to small, they have a extension that makes them extend horizontally but they should be bigger vertically, that is the only problem I have with it and I already resolved it by buying sunglasses.  I have a silver color exterior and black leather interior and I am thinking about tinting the both the front and back windows I don�t know if that is illegal in California though, oh well I guess I�ll find out.  This car is fun to drive it handles very well and the ride is not bumpy at all its very smooth.  So those are my reasons for saying that this car is really a Lexus in disguise.  The quite ride, the feel of the road, the great audio system, and all those great features, make me a believer that this car actually belongs in the Lexus line-up but hey I don't mind it one bit, and my wallet is still as heavy as ever.<br><br>
