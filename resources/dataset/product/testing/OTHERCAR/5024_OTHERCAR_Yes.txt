            A lot of research went into our new car purchase.  Being over 50 I felt this was a car that I would probably own for a long time so I better get it right!  I have a few problems in mobility - ie: arthritis so I considered the features of the cars that interested me most, did research at the library and haunted the dealership lots.

My choices boiled down to the Volkswagon Passat and the Buick Regal.  I chose the Buick Regal and have not been sorry.

Things I considered:

Ride: I like the Regal ride better than the Volkswagon Passat.  The Buick has a smooth, luxury ride, as opposed to the Passat's firmer suspension.

Safety: 
- The safety features ie: crumple zones, flame smothering blanket over the engine, side impact beams, were important to me.
- Computer chip in car key (Pass-key II) to make car less tempting to steal.

Comfort features: 
- I like the sportier interior of the Regal and was glad that the Regal has a hand-clasp engager for the gear shift rather than the thumb button, which I can not operate with my arthritic hands.
- Easily accessible controls for air, heat, radio etc.
- Pass through in back seat from trunk to carry skiis and long items.  This pass through locks, a nice safety feature.
- Drop out headlights for ease in changing burned out bulbs.  
- Heated seats on our model
- Tone selector for radio, cd player and tape player
- Great sound system
- 6 way electric seats
- open view head rests that don't block your rear view and shoulder checks
- lighting system is great.  Side lights light up when you put on the turn signals to make it easier to see what you are turning into.
- Radio continues to play when car is turned off until the door is opened.  This is a nice feature.

The car is a joy to ride in. We had it undercoated to help reduce road noise and we have no problems in that area.  It has good pick-up and steers well.

The seats are very comfortable, again as opposed to the Volkswagon's firmer seat ride.


Now for the not so good things: (and there aren't many)

- The cup holders are too near the elbow to be used comfortably.
- The console between the seats is poorly designed.  It cannot hold Canadian change and cds don't fit in properly.
- The seat belts retract too slowly and are often caught in the door when closing it.
- The trunk, although it appears to open low to the ground, in fact is not easy to put things into.  The back bumper extends quite a ways away from the car and makes it awkward to lean in with large items.  If the back bumper is dirty, so are you.

I would recommend this car to anyone who can afford it.  I think you would be getting a lot more car for your money than if you bought and import.  A luxury car at a mid car price.
