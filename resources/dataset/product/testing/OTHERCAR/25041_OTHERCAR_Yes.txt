            For a non-tech, non-electronic savvy person such as myself, the Kodak DC 4800 3.1 Megapixel digital camera has helped me make great technological strides.  The moment the battery was charged, my husband and I were taking pictures of our house�s construction process as well as items for eBay and some family photos.  We have thoroughly enjoyed it thus far, but have encountered a few obstacles, which I will explain.

<b>Construction</b>
A lightweight 11.6 ounces, this camera fits well in most standard carrying cases and is far from cumbersome even if you should choose to order accessories made especially for it and carry them around with the camera.  It has a durable shell with a flash that you can retract when you�re not using it.  It has an easy-to-read status display on top and a nice LCD screen on its backside, which is clear and user-friendly.  

<b>Use</b>
Some of the camera�s stats are as follows: 
maximum aperture 
wide angle f/2.8
telephoto f/4.5
zoom is 6X  (3X optical zoom and 2X digital zoom)

The camera takes great landscape photos and can be used in the distant mode from 1.6 ft. to infinity.  It is recommended that the flash be used during the taking of all pictures, but it can be disengaged when necessary.  Like many non-digital cameras, there is a slight delay between focus and the actual exposure being taken, so photos that need to be shot in quick succession are not fit for this camera even though you can adjust shutter speed.  

In close-up mode, the camera is most effective from .7 to 2.3 feet.  This is where I faced a few challenges and was disappointed by the camera�s performance.  Because I wanted to sell a few intricately detailed jewelry items on eBay, it was necessary to have respectable close-ups available to prospective buyers.  Even when I relied on the LCD display to capture a close-up, the pictures, when taken in natural and indoor light with flash and no-flash came out very fuzzy.  There was a point during focus where the detail would be completely focused to my eyes, but it wasn�t to the camera, and there was no way to change that even in the manual mode.  As a result of this, we have purchased a lens kit made especially for this camera that includes both a wide-angle lens and a telephoto lens. It is much more effective with this kit, and may be a worthy investment for anyone who would enjoy taking serious close-ups with minimal distortion.

The manual settings let you do a variety of things including adjusting exposure compensation, white balance, and ISO speed; selecting color mode and exposure metering, setting the picture, quality and sharpness, as well as opting for a time/date stamp.  Other features are a self-timer and a built-in tripod mount.  Unfortunately, the lens cover that is included does not come with a string or anything to attach it to the camera, so you risk losing it.

One note on battery life is that in order to take advantage of some of the camera's other features, the LCD display must be used (ex. closeups or when using extra lenses with it) as what is shown through the viewfinder is not what will always show up as your final product.  As a result, this drains the battery quite a bit faster than if you were using it without the aid of the LCD display.

When it came to transferring pictures, it was quite a breeze.  The USB port allows easy file transfer.  It is also very easy to delete any pictures that you want off of the camera prior to loading them onto your computer.  For someone who gets easily frustrated like I do, this was a very welcome feature.   The pictures came out very clear, and even when we played with the different compression levels, the difference in quality was almost insignificant.  

<b>Overall</b>
The starter contents are pretty standard and include the lens cap, a lithium-ion battery, deluxe neckstrap, COMPACTFLASH card, USB cable, video cable for TV viewing, KODAK software CD, Quick-Start guide, user�s guide, and a registration card.

The camera is a very sound investment and is a tool that we plan on using in many different capacities.  It already comes with a wide variety of capabilities, and with a few add-ons, it makes an excellent camera for photography enthusiasts.  Another fear that we won�t have for quite some time is that it won�t be obsolete with next year�s releases.  This is a camera with which I have grown very comfortable and always look forward to using.
