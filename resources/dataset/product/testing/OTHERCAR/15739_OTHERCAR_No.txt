            MY EXPERIENCE:
I test drove a Kia Spectra LS 5-speed sedan at a local dealership. My test drive lasted about half an hour, and covered city streets, winding secondary roads, and the freeway. 

PERFORMANCE:
One of the few bright spots in the Kia's road manners was its surprisingly good acceleration. The Spectra felt energetic around town, and its throttle response was pleasantly eager when I opened it up on freeway on-ramps. But this impression may have had more to do with the loud and ragged growl of the engine, which heightened the sense of speed, than the Spectra's actual accelerative capabilities. I say this because the Kia's engine isn't especially powerful for this class, and its 0-60 times--about 9.5 seconds, according to most magazines--are just average relative to its competitors. Still, I had fun running the Spectra up to speed on freeway on-ramps, and that's more important than the numbers.  

TRANSMISSION/CLUTCH:
Unfortunately, this is where the bad news starts. I found the Spectra's transmission to be easily the worst in the economy-sedan class. The shifter moved in long, flexy arcs across the gates when I changed gears, and it felt rubbery and vague when I pushed it into gear--almost to the point where it didn't feel like the gearlever was connected to anything. On my test drive, I missed several shifts because of the the lever's sloppy and long-winded action, usually when changing from 2nd to 3rd gear. The Spectra's clutch was better, with a pleasantly short throw, but its vague take-up made it difficult to step off the line smoothly. Stepping up to the optional automatic transmission will solve this issue--a choice most drivers prefer anyway--but manual-transmission enthusiasts will be disappointed either way.      

STEERING/HANDLING:
The Spectra's handling is less unpleasant, but it's still far from rewarding. It felt awkward when driven hard on twisty roads, with lots of body lean and a tangible lack of grip from the skinny tires. The steering felt dead, wooden, and heavy, with very little road feel making its way up to my hands. When I turned the wheel to enter a corner, the steering's responses felt vague and slightly disconnected, so the Spectra never went exactly where I pointed it. The Kia always felt safe and stable, but its sloppy control feel kept me from driving as briskly on challenging roads as I could in its competitors. But I suppose most buyers don't care that much about their car's back-road behavior. The Kia's moves certainly felt adequate in moderate, around-town driving, and under those circumstances, it was maneuverable enough to nip in and out of tight spaces with ease. It'll get the job done as a commuter, but once you push the Kia out of its comfort zone, its composure fades fast.    

RIDE:
The Kia lost more points in this area, with a ride that was among the stiffest and noisiest of any car in its class. The suspension clunked and banged frequently on rough roads, and its tires made loud thumping noises when they encountered bumps. The car's structure didn't feel as solid as those of its competitors, and I could feel the car's body shudder and shake slightly when I drove over potholes. This robbed the car of a solid feel, and made it seem a bit unsubstantial through the seat of the pants. Also detracting from the calm was the aforementioned groan of the engine, which was joined at freeway speeds by significant amounts of tire roar and wind rush. I didn't drive this car for long on the freeway, but I could tell that its high noise levels would be a headache--perhaps literally--on long trips.    

INTERIOR:
The Kia's interior was one of its weakest features. Not everyone is as picky as I am about the driving experience, so those flaws may carry less weight for most people. But everyone cares about interior accommodations, and the Kia's were a likely candidate for the dubious honor of worst in class. The impression of cheapness started as soon as I put the key in the door, with a gritty feel to the lock, and the doors closed behind me with a tinny clunk. The dashboard looked like something out of a car from the early 1990's--a generic-looking design constructed from drab plastics--and the tiny gauges looked lost in the gauge pod. Dismal shades of black and gray dominated the interior, which gave it a distinctly gloomy feel. I really love driving, so you know an interior is bad when it kills the mood for me. The plastic console trim felt rough and coarse, and the knobs and switches for the radio and climate controls felt brittle in operation. There were few of the useful storage compartments for sunglasses, change, and CDs that most of its competitors have in abundance. Still, the Kia's interior is not without merits. All the controls were exactly where I expected them to be, even if their presentation left much to be desired. Visibility was excellent in all directions, with a low cowl and thin pillars keeping blind spots to a minimum. The Kia also had all the requisite equipment, plus a few extra niceties like standard CD player and driver's seat-height and lumbar adjustment (although I'd far prefer a seat that's decent to begin with--the one in the Spectra felt as hard and flat as a park bench).    

PRACTICALITY:
This was one of the areas where the Spectra was up to the class average. Despite its disagreeable interior decor, the cabin had plenty of room for front passengers, and reasonable space in the rear as well. The seats offered plenty of adjustment, with the standard seat-height and lumbar controls, so it should be easy for most drivers to get themselves situated. The trunk was fairly spacious for this class, and the split-folding rear seatback helped expand cargo capacity. 

RELIABILITY:
Consumer Reports has no reliability data for the Kia yet, presumably because the cars haven't sold in large enough numbers to provide an accurate survey sample. I don't quite feel comfortable questioning the Kia's reliability without any data, and Kia's lengthy warranty (5 years or 60,000 miles bumper-to-bumper) certainly suggests the manufacturer is confident that the cars will hold up well. My experience with the Spectra left me with an impression of distinctly poor quality, but there's really not enough data here for me to make that judgment.    

OVERALL:
I was really hoping the Spectra would turn out to be a good car, so I could tell people to get over their brand prejudices and give something new a chance. Unfortunately, the Kia fully lived up to its poor reputation, and then some. I love to cheer on the underdog--I really do--but there's just no way I could recommend the Spectra in earnest. From its dreary interior to its crude road manners, the Spectra felt ten years old, right off the showroom floor, and it was totally devoid of the friendly, cheap-and-cheerful spirit that makes most economy cars fun to drive. To sum up: The Kia's list price is tantalizingly low compared to the other cars in its class, but the overriding impression this car leaves is that you get what you pay for. If you're on a tight budget and still find yourself drawn to the Kia's low price, a better alternative would be to look at some late-model used cars instead. I'd suggest looking at an off-lease Honda Civic, Mazda Protege, or Toyota Corolla (or its equally-reliable twin, the Chevrolet Prizm) first. Be picky, and you're sure to find something that is more affordable, more comfortable, and far more satisfying to drive. Or, if you must have a brand-new car, the Hyundai Elantra is nearly as affordable and offers far more refinement and driving finesse. Also, keep in mind that an all-new, redesigned Spectra is due for 2005, so if you have your heart set on buying a Kia (hey, it could happen), it would probably be best to wait for the new and improved model.
