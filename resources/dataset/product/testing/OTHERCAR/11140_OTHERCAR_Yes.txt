                 I have owned and driven a S Coupe for 2 years now, and I've loved every minute of it ! I had never owned a Hyundai when I bought mine a '95 SE (UK), I fell in love with the shape of the car and despite reading some not so great reviews knew that it only needed a little modification to perfect. The car in it's basic form goes quite well in a straight line but has a tendency to float about under hard power and to 'front out' under aggressive cornering, Hyundai shipped a lot of European cars with lowered suspension as standard but this was still not stiff enough to correct the problem. If you are prepared to do some modifications you can lower the car by 15-20mm more vastly improving the floating problem but further camber adjustment is needed to stop the cornering problems.
     Enginewise the car is mechanically sound, although older cars have a tendency to need more regular oil changes than stated service intervals.
     The body shell on S Coupes is prone to flex at speed, there are plenty of aftermarket strutbraces out there to correct this although without roll caging the car you will never achieve full stability.
     My only dislike of this car is the interior, cheap plastic panels, badly designed stalks and no rear leg room, still I'm a bit too young for kids !<br><br>
