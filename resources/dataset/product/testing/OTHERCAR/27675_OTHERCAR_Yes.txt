            I started my search for a fine digital camera about two months ago.  I work in the internet industry so the fact that I don't have to take pictures,  have film developed,  scan the images, etc. really got me going.  I also do a fair amount of graphic art work,  so high res was a must.  The thing holding me back to this point was the lack of res on most cameras.  And then even with the high res cams,  you could only get a few shots on a floppy.  Well,  looks like Sony went and made exactly what I was looking for.

I have had this camera only one month,  and already I am in love.  It is perfect for the kind of graphic / internet work I do.  I haven't taken it all the way through the ringers yet,  testing all the accessories and even some of the options are still left untouched by me,  but their day will come.  

My first complaint was the fact that I use a Mac (like most serious graphics people do) and while the cam hooks nicely through a PC with the USB,  that option is not available for us Mac users.  That was a big mistake in my eyes.  If you don't use a Mac,  then you have the ability to not finalize and run straight through the USB.  Mac is required to finalize anytime you want to put the images to the computer.  And unless I read that manual wrong,  that takes a certain amount of MB's off the CD each time you do that.  Kind of a bummer because I rarely take 160 - 1000 photos before putting them onto the computer.

Next complaint is the flash.  I realize you really don't get much room to put a high powered flash in such a small area of a cam,  but for the $1,400 I spent on it,  I would hope they would give you more.  The flash (to me) is useless unless you are right up on your subject.

Now that I got that out of the way,  lets get on with the good stuff.  I really like the way that the cam handles different lighting situations.  I put it through the ringers on that one and have been impressed each time.  I have shot photos of live bands playing in dark smokey bar rooms with neon lights and stage lights which normally run a digital camera haywire as they tend to focus on the brightest area.  The MVC-CD1000 gets me good pics of the band every time.  

Video quality may not be the best,  but for shooting 15 second bits and posting on the web,  this cam can't be beat.  

The high resolution capability has yet to fail me for serious graphic design and logo development as well as full color shots for brochures.  Very impressive.

All in all,  the Sony Mavica MVC-CD1000 is a great cam for doing work for the internet and even photography for the beginners.  I am not a professional photographer,  but I can see where the camera wouldn't be the first choice for that.  While the price suggests to me that this camera is a professional level camera,  I feel it is best suited as an intermediate level machine.  Overall I am VERY impressed with this product,  and I would strongly suggest anyone willing to fork out over a grand should consider this cam.
