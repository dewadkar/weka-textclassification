            I bought my C-220 when I was 15 in the year 2000. I paid $14000 at a local used car dealer (kind of long story on how I got the money at such a young age). I felt like a real hotshot driving a Mercedes-Benz in high school. 

The car turned out to be a fluke. At 90,000 miles the oxygen sensor and egr valve go out costing a total of about $650. The C class is notorious for having a high maintenance electrical system. The parts are expensive because they have to be imported. Oil changes cost an extra $15 because you have to buy a special imported filter. It may look smooth and sleek and have a smooth feel to it, but that is certainly not worth the outrageous repair bills. If the transmission were to go out, I wouldn't even want to think about the cost to replace it. 

On the upside, the Benz has very comfortable seating and smooth handling. The C220 is only 148 Horsepower (many theorize that production was stopped after 3 years because of its weak engine output). However, it will get out of its own way and cruises smoothly. After all, less power usually means better gas mileage, so I was able to achieve 25 mpg. If only the repairs weren't so expensive it would be a decent car. 

If I had it to do over again, I would buy a used Honda.
