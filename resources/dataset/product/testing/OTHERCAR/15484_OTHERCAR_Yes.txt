            I recently bought the MVC-FD88 to use for family and church events. I have not been disappointed. The ease of taking pictures and then transferring them to our computer programs (newsletters, e-mails, and photo albums, etc)has been the nicest feature. At first I was intimidated with the prospect of the digital camera/computer concept, but was quickly surprised with the simplicity made possible by the floppy disk element. Just load the disk, take your pictures, and download into your computer. It couldn't be simpler. Being able to view your pictures immediately (and deleting those you don't like) also provides you with the greatest benefit this 21st century technology has to offer - instant gratification!  Learning to fine-tune digital picture-taking with this camera has actually become fun; something I never thought could happen with ANY camera.
The only downside to this camera is the price. Of course, as with all new technology, that's the price of wanting the best now.  <br><br>
