            I wanted a sports or a sporty car with all the power, handling and reliability, but also didn't want to pay too much.  So I bought a '98 Prelude SH and I must say, I am VERY impressed with it.  It has all the power you could ever want for the city/highway.  It's no Dodge Viper but who needs that for your daily city commuting?!  The handling on the Prelude is awesome - especially with the ATTS which really handles the car like a rear wheel drive car on fast turns.  And reliability?  Well, it's a Honda.  What more can I say? :)  The best.

The only beef I have with this car is the back seating capacity are tight.  It's not really meant for people back there, just your groceries and stuff.  It's more geared for a 2-seater sports coupe.  Also, the factory sound system could be better, but it's not bad.

Other than that, every time I see my Honda parked anywhere, it makes me smile and want to drive it.<br><br>
