            I can't say enough about the 97' Pontiac Firebird Convertible.  Not only are the fluid lines able to caress the inner thoughts that are comparative to relaxing on the beach or cruising down Rodeo Drive, but the feel of the car will leave you breathless. 

With a stock 3.8-liter series II with 205 horsepower this ain�t your average V6. If you lined up a 97 Firebird and a 97 Mustang (both V6�s) you would see a brief glimpse of the Mustang�s headlights as you passed by. The suspension is tight enough that you can take that sharp curve at neck-breaking speeds but smooth enough that you can relax as you cruise the strip at Myrtle Beach. 

The Firebird has all of your modern safety devices to include dual airbags and a theft lock system. As for the dual airbags you cannot turn off any of the airbags, so please, if you have small children or infants put them in the back seat. An airbag can easily kill a small child so think safe and be safe. The theft-lock system protects your radio as well as your car. If someone breaks your window or hits your car the alarm will go off. If someone disconnects your main battery the radio will not work until you enter the code on the radio (this is a code that you choose by programming the radio). 

Speaking of the radio, definitely opt for the monsoon package. We are talking 10 speakers stock, it�s like a concert in your car! Another plus is the steering wheel radio controls. You know how you always hear about someone having an accident because they were playing with the radio and weren�t paying attention to the radio? Well now you can steer and change the channels or tracks on the CD player without taking your eyes off of the road. 

The power top on this beauty is virtually effortless. Just pull the two handles toward you and push a button the car does the rest. The top is made of a high quality fabric, which has never caused me any problems. It�s weather proof and easy to clean. I have the white with a black top so I have the occasional problem with dust turning my top brown but a car wash will take it right off, leaving it looking brand new. The top is also thick, making it not quite as noisy as your conventional convertible. 

This car is a definite must have if you want affordable bliss.
