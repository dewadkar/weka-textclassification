            I have always been a big fan of Preludes, and I finally had the opportunity to purchase one when I got out of college. 

Pros:
It's fun to drive and looks great.  I love the way it handles on turns.  I have a 5 speed and it shifts into gear easily.  This is a car with a lot of pep!  The front seat is relatively comfortable.  

Cons:
The interior is nothing special, kind of plain actually.  The back seat is cramped -- there is virtually no leg room.  This is definitely a car for 2 people - MAX!   

Overall I've been happy with my 1998 Prelude.  I have the base model and it suits me fine.  I've had the car for 2 years with no major problems.  This is definitely a car I'd recommend to any buyer who wants a sports car for a bargain price!<br><br>
