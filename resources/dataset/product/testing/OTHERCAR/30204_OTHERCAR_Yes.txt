            About three years ago, we were looking for a cheap vehicle which my husband could use to commute to work. We figured why have payments on something that just sits in a parking lot all day? We found a great deal on a 1992 Isuzu Pickup. It had 110,000 miles on it when we purchased it for $2300. What a great purchase this has been for the money! It had previously been a pest control truck for a national firm (think bright yellow, with ears!). After the ears were removed and the truck sprayed white, it looked great. The interior looked brand new. And this from a truck that someone had gotten in and out of all day. We have put on about 30,000 miles and have used it for moving people and picking up landscaping supplies, taking stuff to the dump and it always performs like a champ. We have only had to do regular maintenance (oil changes and such)and one minor repair, which was replacing the EGR valve, which only took my husband 30 minutes to do. The part cost about $55. This seems like one of those trucks that can go on forever.<br><br>
