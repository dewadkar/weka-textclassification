            Subaru has a winning product with the 1999 Legacy Outback Wagon.  Living in the Pacific Northwest, water covered roads are typical for 6 months out of the year.  With a refined all-wheel-drive systems, the Legacy stays solidly in control at highway speeds.  Cornering and handling is precise, especially compared to taller SUVs that lean around corners.  I thought I would miss the ability to turn off 4WD like I could with my previous SUV.  But I found that the Subaru system balances the need for all wheel drive with the efficiency of two wheel drive without my input, and I quickly got over my desire for a 4WD button, lever or switch.  The boxer engine is smooth - too smooth on empty highways, as it is easy to exceed 85mph without noticing engine or wind noise.  The manual transmission shifts easily and the clutch is light but precise.  Seating is comfortable for all day drives and the height adjustable driver seat offers good visibility.  Window controls and cup holders are poorly placed and require some awkward hand movements to access them.  The CD player control buttons are too small and too close together for the driver to use with ease.  Routine maintenance is easy, as the oil plug and filter can be accessed without any special tools or unnatural body contortions.  Subaru's Legacy is a well engineered product that has yielded 14,000 miles of joyful driving.<br><br>
