            For the past year the Acura Integra GSR has been an excellent car.  I drive around town (Manhattan, and Brooklyn) and on the highway(Long Island Expressway, New Jersey Turn Pike, and Garden State Parkway.)  My little Integra GSR gets great gas mileage - I average 28mpg and I have a very heavy right foot - handles like a dream, and is very comfortable.

What I really love about it is the engine.  8100 RPM redline.  You can't beat it.  What's cool is the engine pulls nicely from 2000, scooting around town in traffic is easy, and it doesn't stop pulling till the rev-limiter kicks in.  If you really want to go fast, just don't shift.   Need to pass a semi?  Drop into 3rd and hold on!  Watch out!  97mph comes up fast.  And the car is a total sleeper.  No wings or fancy lines to make it stand out.  A great benefit when you're chasing Mustangs on the TurnPike.

The downside is the high wind noise at speeds over 65.  I just turn up the stereo.  Oh, and the prices for parts is a somewhat higher than Honda or VW.  Since it's an Acura, you won't have to worry about that, just get the regular service and you'll find over the long term you won't pay more than you would for a lesser car.

All in all it's a lovely car.  Here's an extra bonus.  Prices for the 4 door Integra GSR are very reasonable.  If you're in the market for a new econo box, take a look at the Integra.  At around $12,000 you get more power, better handling, and near the same gas mileage as a Civic, with leather, and a moonroof.<br><br>
