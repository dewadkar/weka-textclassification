            <b>Introduction</b>
The Dodge Avenger.  What a nice looking car.  While built on the Sebring frame, the Avenger shares some nice visual perks, but everything else matches up surprisingly similarly to the Sebring Coupe.  The model I am reviewing has the 2.5 liter V6.

<i>I was attempting to edit my Avenger review and found that it isn't even in the Avenger category anymore.  It isn't even in the 1996 Dodge category, now its a 1997 Caravan...I can't get Epinions to fix it, so I'm reposting in the correct category and I'm hoping it will stay put.</i>

<b>Pros</b>
Based on the Sebring frame, this is a fairly large car, even if it may not look that way from the outside.  Both front seats are very comfortable with lots of leg room.  The back gets a little cramped, but not nearly as much as her competition from Ford(Contour).  You still have more than enough room in the back seat, comparable to SUV's.  The trunk is gigantic.

Driving this car is a pleasure, its steering control is fairly snappy, and tight.  The ergonomic aspects is what this car was built around I think.  The stereo is easy to reach from the drivers seat, and is average for a stock system with no real perks or downfalls.  When you open the door, a little ring around the ignition lights up so its easier to find at night.  When you turn off the engine, you still have a few seconds to roll up the power windows.  The door handles are very easy to use, as are the power window controls, which are different from most cars.  A pleasant difference.

This car is gorgeous, from its little runners that stick up on the hood, to the different dodge symbol on the nose, to the slightly impressed doors, to the nice little spoiler, and finally to the gas tank cover.  The rims are very nice, as are the headlights and foglights, both in styling and in performance.  The headlights are great in this car.  The sunroof is something this car should absolutely not be without.  The controls are really easy to use, and its big enough for two people to stand through at once.

<b>Cons</b>
Unfortunately its not all peaches and cream.  While they(friend and her family) have done surprisingly little to it in 70,000 miles, it is not in the best condition.  There is a funny sound and occasional shimmy coming from the right rear tire.  The engine feels tired, and unresponsive.

The dealer replaced the alternator, battery and starter when the battery kept dying.  It was finally realized that the dealer theft deterant hadn't been removed, and once it was everything worked fine.

The 2.5 liter V6 is pretty gutless for a V6, it has a hard time spinning the tires on gravel.  Zero to sixty is estimated at about 16 seconds.  Gas mileage should go up as power goes down, unfortunately not the case in this car.  This little bitty engine, which turns out over 30 in my friends 1997 Sebring has a hard time breaking 20 in the Avenger.  I think there must be something wrong with the engine in the Avenger, since the same engine delivers so much less power, and worse gas mileage than in the Sebring.

I've heard other Avengers will go faster, by my friends car is done running at 80 mph.  It will NOT go any faster than that.  It is however very stable at that speed.

I've heard that door panels coming loose is a big problem in Sebrings and Avengers.  The passenger door panel let go, and replacement harware is pretty expensive.  A well placed sheet metal screw would work as well and be fairly conceiled, or a piece of double sided sticky tape.

Visibility is horrible, since the car has the &quot;Drag Racer&quot; stance, as the rear end is pretty high compared to the front.  Looking out the rearview mirrors you see about 50% rear seat, 25% outside, and 25% roofline.  Looking out the back doesn't really help.  The sideview mirrors aren't that bad, comparable to any other passenger car.

<b>Overall</b>
This is a great car, and pretty reliable up to 70,000 miles.  But lack of power, and mediocre gas mileage keeps it from being my number one choice.

It is however a very nice car to ride in, the seats are really comfortable, and the rear seat is huge.  This is easily a five seater, but loading may become tedious.

As much as I like things about this car, I think a Ford Thunderbird would be a better bet if you really want a two door family car.  The only thing the T-Bird doesn't have is the seating capacity, which is limited to four people.<br><br>
