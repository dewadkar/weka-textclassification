            Since receiving my driver's license 12 years ago, I have become lovingly known in my family as the &quot;Car Jinx&quot;.  The most highly rated and most celebrated car can and will turn out to be a total lemon for me, no matter how much research I do.  Here is just a small sampling of how cursed I am with my current vehicle and do remember that my opinion is probably not representative of the way most people feel about this vehicle.  Remember, I have no luck with cars!   
I purchased my 1996 Volkswagen Passat in October of 1999.  It had 27,000 miles on it and I was just sure that this car would be the last vehicle I would have to purchase for a few years.  It's cute, sporty and an extremely comfortable ride, but within 2 months, none of those elements seemed quite as important anymore.  
By December, I noticed that the speedometer would sometimes work fine, sometimes be off a few MPH's and sometimes not work altogether.  I attributed this to the cold weather freezing my dash board, but when we finally thawed out here in Connecticut, it still was not functioning properly.  I must admit, I neglected to bring it in to have it fixed right away, but with my busy schedule, sometimes it is just too difficult to be without a vehicle for any period of time.  
Well,by May, nothing but the accumulating miles on the odometer were functioning properly(of course). Granted, I have a long commute and managed to put on 23,000 miles in a matter of 7 months, but I don't think that 50K on a car should warrant major repairs.  
I was not prepared for the repair that I would be hit with in June.  While driving to work in an area that I normally don't work in and that is some distance from my home, I noticed the temperature light fervently blinking at me.  I was just a short distance from work, so I drove to the office and had AAA tow it to the nearest dealer. Apparently, the Water Pump and numerous other things that go with the water pump were blown, including the timing belt.  Total cost to replace the instrument cluster on the dashboard and all the other things that virtually combusted because I couldn't tell that the car was overheating : $1500.00.  To add insult to injury, my car was over the 2nd owner 50,000 mile guarantee which would have covered the water pump by only 300 miles.  The dealer refused to cut me any slack, so therefore, I refuse to a) bring my car back there &amp; b) purchase another VW.  
By the way, today I tried to get in the passenger side of the car and noticed that the handle is loose, so now it can only be opened from the inside.  I called for an estimate on fixing this and I was advised that it would be over $200.00.  I can only hope that will be it for a while.      <br><br>
