            <b>1997 Volkswagen Jetta GL Sedan 4D </b>

My first car was a 1982 Volkswagen Scirocco. A little 2-door sports car. I loved that car and it ran great, until I burned up the transmission. And I don&#146t blame the car for that cause as a typical male 16 year old I beat the heck out of it. Drove it like bat outta hell! 

So from that point on I&#146ve always&#146s loved Volkswagens and Bugs and those funky retro looking Vans. 

2 years ago my wife wanted a newer car. We had a 1992 Honda Civic DX, which too was a great car. Really had no problems with that car. So being the way I am, if something works good why change that. Well, my wife prevailed and I ask her if she would consider looking at or for a Volkswagen. I told her about mine I had and how I really abused it and that car was great! She said sure and we started our quest for a used Jetta 4 door. We found a black 4 door, 1997 with about 40,000 miles and in great shape. 

Here are the details on the one we bought.

<b>The Test Drive</b>

From the minute I sat in the drivers seat I loved this car. It brought back instant memories of my Volkswagen Scirocco I had. I had an instant urge to rev the engine and burn off the tires and race down the road till I remembered &#147oh yeah my wife is sitting here too.&#148  So we both took turns driving . 

I liked how the car handles and the steering.Volkswagons have a firmer feel (steering) compared to like Honda's & Toyota's. I also was impressed with the suspension. It had sort-of a sports car feel but not as stiff as some. It rides smoother than my Scirocco did, and for that much my Honda too.It's hard to describe. Volkswagons have their own feel & style to them.

<b> A couple things I don&#146t like</b>
The cup holders are about useless. You can&#146t hardly fit anything in them, so they become extra change holders. Also the trim moldings all have fallen of. I suppose being a black car they heat up more and the sticky backing gives out. I&#146ve re-glued them all on. Also the side mirror adjuster are very hard to use, and is easier to roll the windows down and adjust them by hand.

<b>Parting thoughts</b>
We have had this car for 2 years and haven&#146t had any real problems with it. The car runs smooth, handles great and get&#146s decent gas mileage. 

I really recommend anyone who hasn&#146t tried a Volkswagen to give them a shot. They are great handling fun European cars.

We are considering trading this one in on a new Jetta.
