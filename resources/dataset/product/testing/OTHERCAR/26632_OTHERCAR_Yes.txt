            <b>BMW Z3 Coupe 3.0i, 5-Speed Manual</b>

The Z3 Coupe is the car I used to love to hate.  Its side profile and rear views are ugly as sin, due to the awkward-looking rear section that doesn't quite look like a hatchback and doesn't quite look like its Roadster brother.  But all that changed today when I actually got behind a wheel of a Z3 Coupe 3.0i with 5-speed manual, as part of the "Ultimate Drive" event that BMW does to raise money for the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation.  Basically, you drive the car through a planned route with a blend of highway, city, curves, straightaways on which to test drive the vehicles for about 30 minutes.  ...with no annoying blabber-mouth salesperson to ride along with you.  <i>(More info here: http://www.bmwusa.com/news_events/udsk/intro_udsk.html)</i>  I really got to test drive this car (and a 740i-- see my review) thoroughly today.

<b>Exterior</b>
Let's just get this over with quickly.  It's ugly.  The proportions are strange.  BMW claims that the design yields a perfect 50/50 weight distribution, but I have to tell you, those Germans are more about engineering than design.  (Quick digression: the first Shelby Cobra Coupe ("Daytona") was another ugly car based on German aerodynamic principles, with its chopped-rear look.)  I suppose if you look at it long enough, it becomes tolerable, but compared to the similar Z3 Roadster, this is not a good-looking BMW.  In some ways, however, it's functional, since it's a 2-seater with a decent amount of trunk room, but I still can't tell you if the car is a hatchback, or station wagon, or roadster.

My test car was equipped with 17" wheels with Michelin Pilot Sport tires on them.  I don't think dealers sell the Z3s with Michelin Pilot Sports, but I like the design of the treads on these tires.  The door handles are more like the ones on the old (E36) 3-series than the newer (E46) 3-series.  The back window has a windshield wiper and my car came with a moonroof that didn't open up all the way.  Perhaps I couldn't figure it out, but the moonroof only lifted up for ventilation.  It had nice big rubber seals around it, which should keep out the elements of the weather well when closed.

The side mirrors feel like they are right under your nose, and I was very disappointed by the power side mirrors.  They made a very loud and "cheap" sound when I was adjusting them, a sound that belongs on a $9000 Kia, not a $40,000 BMW...

<b>Interior</b>
The first thing I noticed when slipping into this car is that it feels nice and tight in there.  I'm sure there are bigger folks who would feel a bit claustrophobic in the car.  Also, having just finished a test drive in the 740i, the cockpit felt very tight, but in a good way.  Tight in a good way?  Yes, it makes you feel really connected with the car, and makes you feel like you are in a real race car, not some boulevard cruiser.  Adding to that effect is the fact that the front windshield is very small, and the A-pillar and the little triangle of a window behind it makes you feel like you are behind a roll-cage of a race car.  The hood is visible from the cockpit (unlike on a 3-series coupe/sedan), further enhancing your connection with the car.  In short, the cockpit is designed for you to feel like the car is wrapped around you, and you are in control of it.  The rear windows are large and visibility is fairly good on the sides.  The rear window is a bit smaller than I'd like, but sufficient for this small car.  The rear view mirror was pathetically thin and flimsy, compared to those on other BMWs.  Also, the sun visor is the lamest excuse for a sun visor I've ever seen in a car.  It's so small (about 3 inches wide) I don't know if it will even block the sun when needed!

Inside, there is no armrest, but then your arms would probably not be resting much in a car like this.  The center console cupholder and coin holder was black while the rest of the car was brown inside-- it looked a bit odd.  Also, the center console was not flush with the rest of the console, looking like it was just tacked on there as an afterthought.  I liked the little analog clock in the center dash, but felt that the radio controls were a bit too small.  The shifter was an "M" 5-speed shifter with aluminum trim and felt nice under my hands, but I would have liked it a tad bit shorter.  I think it's the same size shifter as the one in my 325Ci.  Enough about the interior, let's get to the real reason why someone would buy this car:

<b>Performance</b>
As soon as I started up the engine, I knew this was no ordinary BMW.  The engine sound was a lot louder than the ones in the 3-series (and of course the 7-series), and putting my foot down on the throttle yielded a very very pleasant exhaust note that immediately brought a smile to my face.  The exhaust note sounded like a race car's exhaust; a nice and loud, low tone.  In disbelief, I had to ask the BMW guys there twice if they added an aftermarket exhaust system to the car, and they said no, the car is completely stock!  

The steering wheel is stiff and very responsive.  No overboosted steering to complain about here.  Clearly, the car was not designed to be maneuvered in and out of parking spots at the suburban malls.  The suspension was a bit tighter than the usual 3-series sedan/coupe, but it seemed very appropriate for a car like this.

Taking the car through the gears is so much fun!  The engine sings a nice, deep baritone note as I take it past the 4000rpm mark and the car keeps pulling and pulling up to the redline.  Although it has the same 3.0L 225-hp inline-6 engine found on the 330 sedans and coupes, driving this Z3 will have you believe that it's a completely different engine!  First, there is so much power there throughout the entire RPM range.  Second, the engine and exhaust sound is just so raw and their presence is known at all times; in the 3-series, you sometimes forget that the engine is there if it's below 3000rpm.  Third, the Z3 is a lot lighter and it's smaller than the 3-series sedans and coupes, which probably helps a lot in propelling the car forward like it did.

Downshifting in this car is such a fun exercise, since I get to bleep the throttle and hear that sweet exhaust sound.  People on the street perked up when they heard the sound, thinking there was a Lamborghini or a Corvette coming their way.  Nope, it's just me in a little BMW 2-seater having way too much fun...

The brakes respond immediately and provide nice linear stopping power.  There's no drama involved, which is a bit of a let-down, but then, you don't want your car to sway or lean or nose-dive too much when you're in an emergency braking situation.  On the corners, the car shows its "ready to play" characteristics well.  Due to the size and the rigidity of the chassis, the car begs to be "tossed" around, and it will happily do so.  I've managed to break loose the rear end a few times, and the feeling is that it is your body that is breaking loose and then regaining composure, not just the car.  The Coupe retains its composure at all times, confident and responsive to all my crazy driving moves.  The whole time, you feel like a part of the car, which responds to your steering, braking, and acceleration as a body part would respond to the commands of your brain.  I was bummed that the Michelin Pilot Sport tires squealed so much at the limits, but maybe they weren't inflated correctly, or maybe they are not the best suited tires for this kind of car.

The thing about driving and rowing through the gears is that you never get to see how you look like in the car.  After about 5 minutes of driving, I forgot that I was in a car that I considered the ugliest looking BMW ever.  It didn't even matter any more.  All that mattered was that the car responded to my controls without hesitation and that I was grinning from ear to ear the entire time.

<b>Conclusion</b>
This car is the most raw BMW I've driven.  It's as if BMW took a race car off the track, put in a few interior amenities, and handed it over to you.  Whereas the 3-series is about 55% luxury and 45% performance, the Z3 Coupe 3.0i is 90% performance and 10% something else.  I drove the 5-speed manual version of the car and I wouldn't even think about ordering a car like this with an automatic transmission.  I highly recommend any non-believers and critics of the Z3 Coupe's looks to get behind a wheel of a 5-speed 3.0i and come to realize what this car really is about.  Hint:  It's not about looking good.
