            During 1999 when everyone else was worrying about the Y2K bug I was busy looking for a new way to get around since I had bottomed out the oil pan on my 1991 Firebird and was in need of new wheels. After an exhaustive search of Los Angeles used car dealerships, each equipped with their own breed of used car salesmen, I finally decided on a 1994 Firebird. The car looked absolutely great, the interior was a huge step up from the previous generation of Firebirds(1983-1992). This car actually had cup holders and a glove compartment! The rear seat had gotten a little smaller, but the fact that this car had cup holders and a glove compartment made up for the sacrifice of rear hip space.

The 1994 Firebird is the second production year of the 4th generation of the GM F-body, chevy makes the Camaro which is almost the same car as the Firebird. The 1994 Firebird comes with a 3.4 liter V6 engine and makes around 160 horsepower. With a curb weight tipping the scales around 3300 pounds this car has enough power to feel sporty. But the sporty feeling vanishes as soon as you hit a curvy road. This car handles like a brick. In turns and braking there is noticeable dipping of the front end and that sloshing feeling as the car tips into turns. And the rear end is extremely tail happy and tends to kick out on you during high speed turns. Not even high performance tires could make up for this design flaw. The turning radius is horrible, I had to constantly do three point turns on streets that most cars can flip a quick U-turn on.(AKA flipping a b!tch)

My initial attraction to this car really took a nose dive as I started to add more miles to it. This car was not built to last. In the one year I owned the car I spent in repairs half of what I paid for the car. Everything from fiberglass body panels falling off to a melted EGR valve this car had some serious problems. Now this was my second Firebird and I thought since it was a newer one then the previous 1991 Firebird I had owned that it would be an improvement. In a lot of ways I feel it was a step back. The handling was worse, the engine was hard to get to and work on and the paint on the front bumper will come flaking off if you so much as tap another car while parking. So if you are looking for a cheap car that looks great and needs a lot of maintenance a 1994 Firebird is perfect for you. But if you want a better car for your money I would recommend buying a 1991 or 1992 firebird or trans am, they are not as nice ergonomically but they are built better and are better performing cars.
