            When my first love, a 1991 Toyota Previa started becoming too elderly to keep up with repairs, I reluctantly began looking for its replacement.  I had no idea of what type of vehicle I wanted because nothing seemed to compare to my old van.
I looked a few vans, but the Toyota Sienna and Honda Odyssey were too expensive, even used.  The Dodge and Chevy versions were attractive on the outside, but felt the inside left much to be desired. 
We've had Toyota 4-Runners, a Chevy Tahoe and a Volkswagon Passat and I've been ho-hum about them all.
I looked seriously into the Honda CR-V and the Toyota RAV-4 but after test driving both, I found wind and/or road noise to be unacceptable.  I really felt disheartened about this seemingly endless stream of what I perceived to be inadequate vehicles. 
Just on a whim, I decided to peek into a Grand Cherokee Larado - I had never before even looked at one because I've always been distrustful of Chrysler products.  I only did so because the advertised price was only a few thousand more than the regular box-style Cherokee and I wanted to see the difference.  Oh wow, here was the vehicle I'd been looking for and I hadn't even gotten inside of it.  

Of course, acting disinterested and being somewhat critical I took it for a test drive.  It was the first time I'd ever been inside a Jeep and I was hooked.  The seat fit me so well that it seemed to have been custom - fully adjustable with perfect thigh support to prevent driving fatigue.  The dashboard was low and easy for me to view, making windshield visibility more expansive for my short stature - this was a huge plus.  The controls were well placed and can easily be manipulated with gloved hands.  Air vents are also well placed and the cabin is cooled/heated very quickly and efficiently.  And in similar fashion to the Toyota 4-Runner, the Jeep Grand Cherokee drives like a car.  It's whisper quiet, smooth and can turn on a dime.  The backseat is more spacious with respect to leg and head room and will easily accommodate my growing children.  I can sit back there myself without feeling claustrophobic like I did in our old 4-Runner.  The cargo area is also spacious and can be made more so by folding down the rear seats.  I really like that the rear window can be popped open separately from the tail gate.
After purchasing this particular Jeep for $16,100 including tax, I continued to find neat little things about it.  The pen holder in the center console; the 10-station programmable radio; the numerous features on the overhead display like setting the service interval, number of miles left before the tank needs to be filled up, current gas mileage and such.  

My Jeep is a V8, which I would have ordinarily avoided.  However, it gets such similar mileage to the V6 that it became a non-issue.  I tend to get around 23-25 mpg and I drive fast, so I think our gasoline bill is very reasonable.  It came with a CD player, which I've never had a lick of trouble with, and some fancy wood trim on the dash.  With it's big tires, pewter gray body and charcoal/gray plush interior, I think it's a very sharp looking car.  I don't feel like a soccer mom (van) or a yuppie mom (ford expedition or larger).  I just feel like a girl who happens to have kids driving a car that happens to fit me just right

Now, onto the bad stuff.
I researched this particular model year on here and spoke with several independent mechanics before I bought and discovered that some of the 2000's had some serious brake issues.  Many people complained about the frequency in which the brakes had to be replaced and the cost of those repairs.  I must say that I'm pretty confident that I bought one of those vehicles.  I just spent nearly $900 on 3 new rotors, a pair of calipers and a probably a whole jar of grease to loosen up the corrosion on the rear calipers. The pads on mine were worn very unevenly.  The mechanic confirmed to me that he has seen a few of my exact vehicle year/type with the exact same problem, but the repairs back when the car was new were in the $2000+ range.  With a promise to have the braking system checked twice a year, I will follow up this report on how my brakes are holding out.

Other than this, I absolutely love this car.  I'm crazy about it.  I've decided that when I wear this one out, I'm going to get another one.  Newer, yes, but it's definitely going to be a Jeep Grand Cherokee
