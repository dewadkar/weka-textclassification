            I bought this car about 3 weeks ago, and i love it.  I bought the car for its sporty look..but not having the sports car insurance rates.  Also i didnt' want a car that is so common like the saturns and hondas you see at every corner.  The car has looks, that few cars in the same price range can touch, i always catch people checkin' out my car.  The car is a very cozy daily driver, drives very smoothly..even on rough roads.  It has a suprisingly roomy interior, even the back seats can comfortably seat large adults.  Although the car sits very low, some people might not like the &quot;sitting on the ground&quot; ..or getting in and out of the vehicle so low to the ground.  Anyone considering buying a avenger should visit www.asog.net home of the Avenger/Sebring Owners Group ..there you can find hundreds of avenger owners ... ask questions and get advice.<br><br>
