            The size of the Minolta Dimage X opens new avenues for digital cameras.  In addition to stealth photo ops., this camera begs to be included in any outing.  I keep mine with my keys and wallet so it comes everywhere with me and I never miss digitally documenting my adventures in everyday life.  However, these capabilities come with some sacrifices.

Despite its small size, the camera is relatively easy to use.  The buttons are small and could be awkward for those with larger hands and the lens sits in the corner of the camera making it easy to obstruct.  However, the button layout and interface is relatively intuitive.  The battery life is good and the battery cradle allows you to charge one battery while another is in use.  Compared with my previous digital camera, the batteries seem to last forever.  Another nice upgrade from my last camera is the capability to create batch deletes from the memory card.

The picture quality is adequate but not great.  If you are just shooting shots of friends or landscapes and are not too serious about perfect color and high resolution, then it is great.  Most printers can't accomodate higher resolutions anyway.  The Dimage Xi also provides better resolution if you want the same size camera with better quality.

Despite the camera's shortcomings, its size makes it remarkable.  Never again do I catch myself saying "%^$&, I wish I had my camera right now" and that is worth a lot to me.  If your looking for small, and willing to sacrifice a little bit of ease of use and some quality, I highly recommend this camera.
