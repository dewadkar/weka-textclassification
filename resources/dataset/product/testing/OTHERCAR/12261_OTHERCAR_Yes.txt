            I purchased this car on July 3rd 1999.  I have been a Honda Accord owner many times over, and wanted to get something different.  I happened across this car on accident, but like what I saw.  It was much better than the previous model (ugly and boring).
I was also impressed by the price and value.
Here is what I think of it, 1.5 years and 33k later:
Pros:  
Value.  Option for option, it was significantly cheaper than the accord or camery.  I got the V6 ES loaded with everything but a roof and leather for under 21k.  An equal Accord was 24.  In my opinion, this is the reason to buy this car over everything else out there.  It has no competitors.
Performance:  the V6 engine is the best in class, and a great value.  Almost 200 horse and 190 something torque gives this great drivable power.  Great starts and superb passing.  Super quiet and smooth.  All this and I average 24 MPG!!  That is unreal.  I drive hard too.  Transmission supposedly learns how you like ot drive and adjusts.  I am not sure that is true, but it is a smooth shifting system that always seems to find the right gear.
Looks:  very nice looking car.  Obviously attempting to look like a BMW 3 or 5 series, but that is okey.
Ergonomics:  Easy to drive.  No real bad blind spots.  Great simple dash.  Supportive comfortable seats.
Room:  Not as big as accord or camery, period.  Close though, and big enough.  Back seat is reasonable, not great.  Trunk is very good, with nice net and great shocks on the lid - it opens and shuts easily.
Stereo:  average or better.  CD and tape, nice controls, nice sound.  Very good AM reception which is hard to find.
Other:  Best cruise control I have ever had.  Bar none.

cons:
Seems to be a little below honda's quality.  A few rattles that Honda does not have, and never did.  Few nickle and dime issues:  lights in the dash burnt out, etc.  Do not take this wrong.  this is still better than anything the US boys can produce and has great quality, just not quite to honda or toyo level.
Great goodyear tires on it as far as performance and sound, but very poor traction life.  I need new ones after 33k and they are expensive.
