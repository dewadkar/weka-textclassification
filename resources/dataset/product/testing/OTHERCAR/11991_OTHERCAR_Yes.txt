            The Mitsubishi Mirage has definitely impressed me; however, it didn't start that way!  My wife and I set out to buy something we could not only afford but a vehicle we would both be wiling to drive.  She instantly fell in love with the sporty, compact feel and design.  She stands about 5 feet 4 inches, while I am around 6'1&quot;.  I hated this car!  Then I got inside and it opened up for me.  The Mirage gets around 37 miles to the gallon and the tank only holds eleven gallons!  Our car has never seen a maintenance shop,outside of the normal oil change and tune-up.  She just rolled over 38,500 miles in Jan.  The little car is fun to drive and extremely quiet at 80.  The 4 cylinder engine in the car never ceases to amaze me, it loves to move!  The trunk is absolutely huge in comparison to most compact cars, I have a 10 inch subwoofer in there and groceries for 2 are never cramped.  Bottom line is that she is inexpensive and fun to drive!<br><br>
