            I bought this product at overstock.com because it was 40% off the suggested retail price($99), I had a $20 coupon, and the product page describing it looked really good. The software that came with it is easy enough to use and the camera itself is very user friendly. But I should have just saved my money to get a better digital camera. I had planned to use it to sell items at online auctions but the pictures are so grainy and fuzzy. The batteries get exhausted quite easily. Their Agfa online support doesn't really address the flaws of this camera (of course). It's a shame to put a product as inferior as this out in the market to dupe consumers into thinking we can buy something affordable and functional. Needless to say, I am very disappointed with this purchase. I would not recommend this to anybody, even as a first camera. I won't even dare give it away.<br><br>
