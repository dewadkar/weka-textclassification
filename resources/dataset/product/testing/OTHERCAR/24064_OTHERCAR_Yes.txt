            The Relisys Dimera 3500 Digital Camera gives you decent digital pictures at an extremely reasonable price.  I wanted to be able to take digital pictures so I scoured the Internet and found this camera on sale at XOOM.Com.  It cost less than $100 plus shipping.

The published features include either 640 x 480 or 320 x 240 pixels resolution, 24 bits color depth, a 2M memory card, a 10 second self timer, serial connection, battery, AC Adapter power supply or power cable, 8 to 26 image storage capacity, CCD electronic shutter and built in flash.

Now I've used this digital camera and I'm extremely pleased with the quality of the pictures it produces.  For my money it gives results equal to the Epson camera (with more bells and whistles) that my girlfriend owns.  The software that comes with the package leaves a lot to be desired, but because the Dimera 3500 is TWAIN compatible I'm able to access images through other software like Paint Shop Pro or Photo Deluxe.

The Dimera 3500 is extremely light and comes with a black leatherette case with belt look and wrist strap.  One concern is the fact that the lens has no protection outside of the case.  I'm concerned that I might damage it if I drop the camera or scrape it accidentally against a hard object.  This kind of damage would make the entire camera virtually useless.

The viewfinder is framed within the window to line up picture and there are two indicator lights.  One for power on and the other for flash ready.  By the way, the flash is sensitive to ambient light.  It won't flash if sufficient light is available and flashes in dark situation.  This is a pretty standard feature with the two digital cameras I have used and I like it.

Clearing the image memory can be accomplished two ways.  The camera has a recessed &quot;erase&quot; button that clears internal images after you hold it down for several seconds.  The other option is to clear images via the software after you download them from the camera.   There is also a 2MEG memory card included and I suppose I can purchase another if I ever planned to take the camera away and didn't have access to a computer to download images.  I don't know what an additional card costs.

So far I am pleased with this camera.  I recommend it if you are like me, and want to get into digital photography at a reasonable price.
