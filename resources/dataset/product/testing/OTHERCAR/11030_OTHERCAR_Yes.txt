            I purchased a 1990 Chevrolet Astro Van used in April of 1994.  I was in desperate need of a reliable vehicle to haul four children and myself back and forth to school, the grocery, dance lessons, music lessons, birthday parties--well, you get the idea.  I had a master mechanic do a complete under the hood inspection and road test on the vehicle before I purchased it -- for $5,500.00!!  He found NOTHING amiss with this vehicle and did not miss a beat when he recommended that I make the purchase.  For five years I literally drove that van to death!  I wasn't always able to make the oil changes, tune-ups, etc. on time (in fact I was often WAY past due in routine maintenance performance).  Amazingly enough, the van just kept on running -- safely and reliably!  Unfortunately, because I did not keep up with the maintenance on a regular basis I destroyed the carburator and was forced to sell the van that I loved so much -- after owning it for FIVE years, for, are you ready? -- $3,500.00!!! Talk about getting your monies worth!  As soon as possible, I will be purchasing a NEW Chevrolet Astro Van -- and this time I'll be sure not to abuse my vehicle, so that we may enjoy a long and happy life together!<br><br>
