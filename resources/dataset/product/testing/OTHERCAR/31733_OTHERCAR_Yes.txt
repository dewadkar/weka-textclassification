            I looked at the Intrepid in 1995, and while pleased with it I bought
another Taurus because I got a price I couldn't refuse.  

I also thought that the 1995 Intrepid was noisy on certain types of roads. 
 On concrete roads, it seemed to reverberate road noise in those plastic front fenders like a drum.  Not a Problem with the changes made in the 1998/99 model year when the car was re-tooled and no more plastic fenders.

I looked at Intrepid again this Last August and bought a 1999 ES.   I liked it so much my wife just bought a 2000 this May.   

LIKES: Roomiest car on the road. Handling is Great. Ride is silky smooth and quiet.  The biggest surprise is that the gas mileage is so good (about 24 MPG with about 75% highway).
DISLIKES:
My only complaint is the size of the opening into the trunk is not large considering the size of the trunk itself.  You could put a lot in this trunk provided it's small enough to get in the opening. 
The AutoStick, though it works fine isn't very good on gas.  It also 
might be another thing to break.  I don't use it.<br><br>
