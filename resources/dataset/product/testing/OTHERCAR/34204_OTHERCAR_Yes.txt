            Even though I bought this camera in the summer of 2002, it is still one of the highest MP and resolution cameras amongst my friends and family!  With that in mind, you must realize that I take lot of pictures... a lot!

I have logged over 6500+ pictures since my purchase.  So this review has a bit of wisdom behind it...

When looking for a camera, I kept several things in mind; high MP's, MPEG movie capabilities, storage, and size.  The P9 surpassed my expectations in that it offered a lot more than I thought I was getting!

I bought the camera, oo-gling over the 4 MP it offered (back then, the P9 was one of the highest MP camera with a reasonable price).  Its MPEG movie capabilities offer sound and the length is only limited by the amount of free space you have on your Memory Stick.  It was a lot smaller than I had anticipated, fits in my jean pockets no problem.

If the camera isn't enough, I was concerned when the lens cover was not opening all the way when the camera was powered on...  I immediately called Sony's warranty center trying to protect my investment, the one and only P9!  I sent it to a repair center, where they cleaned and fixed it.  Not only was the camera only gone for about a week, but they kept me updated via a Sony Repair Status website.  It was a very easy process.  Once I got my camera back, it worked perfectly!

Then, just recently, I was rafting down a small, slow river with my camera in a plastic bag.  Luck would have it that my raft was the only one that popped on a rock, sending me completely under water - with my camera in hand!  Surely the camera was going to be ruined - NOPE!  It was completely soaked underwater for at least 10 seconds, and it still functioned properly!  To this day, it has not flawed or blundered!  (knock on wood!)
