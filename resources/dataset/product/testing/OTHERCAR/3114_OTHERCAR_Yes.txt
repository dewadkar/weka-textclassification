            Elegant, sleek, stylish, affordable - these are just some of the adjectives that may be used to describe the Hyundai Elantra. Being a new Elantra owner, I can tell you that they are all true!

Being a new driver, I was looking for a car that was easy to handle, was roomy, was classy without being dull and that was in my limited price range. I found it all in the Elantra!

During my test drive, I found the car extremely user-friendly. The controls are marked clearly and driving the car is a breeze. 

Also, the car is extremely roomy. It does not look as such from the outside, but when my father, a rather large man, accompanied me on the test drive, he was impressed with the leg room and the wide bucket seats. 

Being a young driver, I wanted something that was remotely sporty but still practical for a couple interested in starting a family in the near future. The Elantra appears stylish and sleek whilst providing such sedan features as four doors and child safety locks. 

The Elantra has standard features that many car owners can only dream of -power windows, power locks, power mirrors, cruise control, air conditioning - this car is well worth the money!

Most impressive is the 5 year/60,000 mile bumper-to-bumper warranty that comes with all Hyundai vehicles. For those who desire to do so, you may extend the warranty to 10 years bumper-to-bumper, with the peace of mind that if you do not own the car for 10 years, Hyundai will issue you a refund check for the years that the car is not in your possession. My husband and I decided against the extended warranty option, mainly because we hope to trade it in after the 5 years.

The *only* negative that I found in this car is that it has a small trunk. However, this downside is compensated by the rear seats which fold down when needed, allowing extra space!

If you are looking for your first car, an affordable second car, or are just simply on a tight budget as I am, I highly recommend this car! You cannot get a better car for the money or a better warranty!

Happy driving!<br><br>
