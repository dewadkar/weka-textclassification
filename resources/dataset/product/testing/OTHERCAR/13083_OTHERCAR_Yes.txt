            This is the first digital camera I've ever owned and I think this one will be the last.  Before I took the $639 plunge I looked into what was available out there and boy there were TONS of options.  I was very interested in the Olympus C-5050 but was turned off by its size.  My brother had told me about the Sony DSC-V1, which was pretty new on the market.  It is 5 megapixels and can be decreased depending if you want to conserve your memory. It has full automatic control as well as manual settings for those who want to get creative and know their way around cameras.  It also touted a Carl Zeiss lens. It has a 1.5" LCD screen - I went on vacation to Hawaii and I put my Sony to good use.

First of all Hawaii is BEAUTIFUL, if you haven't been you should definitely make plans to go.  What I brought with me was 2 rechargeable infolithium batteries (one battery came with the camera, the other I bought for 60 bux).  Two (2) 512 Memory Stick Pro (one Sony and one Sandisk).  Boy are those memory sticks expensive.  Sony was the most expensive $235 while Sandisk was about $220 (still pretty expensive).  So I had about 1 gig of memory - at 5.0 about 400 pix at 3.2 about 600 pix.  I found out that at 3.2 megapixels you can still produce great prints of 8x11.5" pictures.  I took people pix, scenery pix, macro/close ups of the beautiful flowers pix and everything (unless I was out of focus with my shaky hands) came out spectacular.  The greens were green the reds were reds.  The polynesian costumes are rich with color and it captured it.  The ocean was blue, the beach waters a blue/green hue was captured by the Sony.  I was able to take stills and motion pictures... I captured both... the surf on the beach - the polynesian cultural dancing... while the motion picture feature is nice the picture is not as clear as a video camera.

It has automatic and manual controls (no focus controls) - manual controls include both aperture and shutter speed (both can be manually controlled individually).  You can also set the ISO setting from 100 - 800.

I can't say enuff good things about this camera... small compact... rich color and great automatic and manual settings... excellent lens and has a built in flash.  What more do you need?
