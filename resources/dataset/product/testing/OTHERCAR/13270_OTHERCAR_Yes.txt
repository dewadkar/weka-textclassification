            I owned this car for exactly one year.  It turned out to be the best car I've ever owned and one of the best I've driven.  I leased a four door sedan, EX.  It was spacious, comfortable, very reliable and great looking.  While I wouldn't consider this car to be inexpensive I would definitely call it a great value.  It has a quick pickup, and great handling, especially in bad conditions.  The front wheel drive really grips the road.  In addition the car gets great mileage.  I would definitely recommend this car to anyone shopping for a new car.  I'm sure that you would love it.<br><br>
