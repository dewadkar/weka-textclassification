            The 1995 Nissian Maxima sedan is a very good and reliable automobile. The one that I now own has over 65,000 miles on it and the only maintenance that I had had done to it, is replace the front brake pads and turn the front rotors.  Also I had to replace the battery.  The Automobile gives a very smooth ride, it handles very good.  I get around 28/32 mile to the gallon on the highway and around 16 in the city. The weigh of you foot does decide the final gas mileage. I tend to have a heavy foot on the highway but the gas mileage is  still very good.
The only problem that I have with this car is the location of the trunk release handle. It is located on the driver's door right beside where your wallet tends to be. I had problems with opening the trunk at the wrong time, until I moved my wallet from my back left pocket. 
The factory support is outstanding, had to have the drivers seat belt replaced and it was done in a very speedy and professional manner.
I would recomend to my friends to purchase a new Maxima for they just get better every year.<br><br>
