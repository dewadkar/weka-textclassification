            When we first moved to the urban East Coast from the suburban Midwest, we were a little intimidated by the lack of easy parking on the streets and the often cramped parallel parking spaces.  We tried to get by without a car for a few months but soon figured out that we needed one to get to the grocery stores, etc.  So we bought our first new car, a 1997 Geo Metro.  The little blue jelly bean of a car was &quot;fully loaded&quot; which meant it had air conditioning and a four cylinder engine instead of three cylinders.  Not a lot of extras, but two and a half years and 30,000 miles later, the little car is still gamely chugging along.  We haven't had any service problems and it gets incredible gas mileage.  The only shortcoming is the size of the backseat and the non-trunk, but that's only a problem when we have to pick up another couple from the airport and have to deal with luggage as well as passengers.  But the size is a huge advantage when it comes to parking along city streets -- we can fit into many spaces that slightly larger cars could never consider.  Trust me, that's a lot better than trolling the streets searching!  When we move back to the Midwest, we will probably say goodbye to our trusty little Geo -- but under the current circumstances, we'd buy it again in an instant.<br><br>
