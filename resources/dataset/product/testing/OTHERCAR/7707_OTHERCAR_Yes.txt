            I haven't purchased the Tahoe yet but, after renting one for a weekend it is next on our list of things to buy.  I loved everything about this vehicle.  We have owned two Explorers and after the second one we decided not to buy another SUV based on things that happened with our second Explorer but we have changed our minds.   
The Tahoe had more room than I could use and being a woman that is rare for me.  I loved the way the doors opened up in the back side by side instead of lifting the whole door up for everyone to see everything in your vehicle.  It had leather interior that was just as smooth as baby skin.  The front seat was so comfortable and lots of room.  I had electric adjustable seats with heat and lumbar support.  That was awesome.  
We had three children in the back seat that were very comfortable and had plenty of room to move around without invading the others space.  Gas mileage wasn't the best in the world but, with comfort and ease who cares about a few extra dollars on gas.  You can normally expect that with a SUV anyway.
It was very quiet on the inside also.  The ride actually reminded of riding in a Lexus.  Very nice!
To me the Tahoe was more than I ever expected.  Comfortable, lots of room, sporty and easy to handle for a woman.  I am looking into purchasing this vehicle as soon as possible.
