            The FUJI was purchased for an inexpensive way of publishing pictures for eBay auctions.  It was purchased on eBay from a dealer for a good price.

The unit is nothing fancy, but for the money has performed very well.  With limited memory (2MB) it can hold about 6 pictures which is adequate for its intended purpose.  To use personally, I'd want a minimum of 8MB.  The unit produces 1024x768 images which is adequate for on-line use.  For good photography, a higher resolution would be desirable.  The unit is small and easy to use.  It had a manual mode with white balance which allows good color correction for indoor lighting.

As with many digital cameras, have a supply of batteries available.  A good alternative would be rechargeable alkaline or NiCd batteries for continued use.

The only problem noted is that many eBay pictures need to be shot in the range between Macro and Regular, so a couple pictures are required to decide which is best at the 18&quot; distance.  If using the camera for closer or farther photography, it works extremely well.<br><br>
