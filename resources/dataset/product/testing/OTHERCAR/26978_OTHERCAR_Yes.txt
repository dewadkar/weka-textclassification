            I decided about a year ago that I needed a pickup, since my soon-to-be exwife already had a good sportscar that I helped her buy. I'd been driving my '95 Buick Skylark for over a year or so. I kind of hated to part with it, but since I've usually into sportscars or nice trucks, it just didn't really fit my image. I mean, no offense, but it seems that most of the time when I see these cars, there are older people driving them. They're smart; they don't exactly think as much about image, I guess!

Well, I bought a Ford F150 (not usually into Fords, but oh well, it was cheaper than a Chevy) and I really like this truck! The only thing I don't like about it that makes me miss my Buick is the gas mileage, especially with the gas prices going up here lately! But let me get back to the Buick Skylark. 

When I first bought this car, I was just looking for something to get me to work. I wanted to get rid of a 1986 Camaro that I had, I mean, I loved the car, it was so pretty and sporty, but it was rattling, had a rebuilt title, etc.. Anyway, my dad went with me (I'm not so brilliant when it comes to buying autos, it's usually hit and miss with me!) to help me out, and I couldn't hardly find a car I liked. But my dad noticed this car, and the salesman said we could drive it around the city, so I figured, what the...  Anyway, we took that car to look at other cars, like Mustangs and Cavaliers, etc.. But as we drove, I noticed that this car was pretty nice, despite the fact that it had a lot of miles on it! Well, it wasn't that old, but it had almost 70,000 miles on it, if I remember right. 

There were actually two of these Skylarks on the lot, and my dad went to the trouble of calling each of the previous owners. Got some odd feedback on the other car, but this one the owner, an elderly lady said she hadn't had any trouble, was just trading up. So needless to say, since my wife really liked it, we bought it. 

We didn't have a bit of trouble with that car, except for one minor irritant. Occasionally we'd hear a 'thump' in the rear, but that could have been something loose around the spare tire, or something else similar to that. Other than that, it gave us no trouble. Air conditioner worked fine, drove excellent.

Oh yeah, one other minor detail that I hardly noticed, only occasionally. The center console in the middle (oh, that is the center, eh? hehe), you know how hit goes down to the center of the floorboard, in between the driver and passengers legs and feet, well every once in awhile, I'd notice that it rubbed against my right leg, almost as if there wasn't enough room down there. It also seemed a bit loose, but other than that, it was a good car. I not only miss the better gas mileage, but I miss the car as well. It was black and had tinted windows.
