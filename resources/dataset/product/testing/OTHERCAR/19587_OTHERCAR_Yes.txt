            I have been using a Chevrolet Suburban for the past two weeks as a loner from my company.  I have had to take several long trips (300 plus miles) since I have had the vehicle.  I am a very large gentleman and have a large family also.  The car is extremely comfortable, even on the long trips.  Because of the size of the Suburban it rides very smooth and gives a real sense of security.  Besides being very comfortable and with tons of extra room, it gets good gas mileage.  My wife loves driving the car and although it is long and wide, is not intimidating.  It handles well both on the road and around town.  Parents with lots of children or large families in general would benefit from such a spacious vehicle.  I plan on owning one and keeping it for a long time.<br><br>
