            I'm a 29-year-old mother of two...let's face it...the last thing I wanted to drive is a van.  A van is for those late-thirty and forty age group Moms.  You know, the ones who aren't &quot;cool&quot; anymore??  All kidding aside, the thought of owning and driving a van sent shivers down my spine.  Boy, was I in for a surprise!

First of all, what made us decide to purchase a van was the fact that I was constantly dragging around my kids and my friend's kids and a sedan just doesn't cut it for more than 3 kids in the back.  I was either having to make more than one trip, take more than one car or leave somebody out.  None of those options were suitable.  

As far as choosing the type of van we would purchase, that was easy.  I (secretly) fell in love with this platinum colored van sitting at the Chrysler dealership right around the corner from our home.  Of course, I told no one about this prior to purchasing it but it was so pretty.  I also knew that my parents and my brother had driven Dodge/Chrysler vehicles for years and had gotten 100,000 miles + out of their cars and vans with no problems at all.  Also, prior to purchasing it, we were able to borrow our friend's Plymouth Voyager and it drove like a dream.

Driving my Chrysler Town &amp; Country is just like driving a car.  I found out from the dealership that these vans are built on a car chassis and that's why they drive so smoothly.  The biggest adjustments that I've had to make are getting used to my new &quot;blind spots&quot;, backing up (the windows are tinted so it's sometimes hard to see at night), and remembering which side my gas tank is on.  I love sitting up higher and being able to see what is holding up traffic and I love the extra room that we have.  

We made our first major trip in our new van this summer.  We drove a total of 2,000 miles.  It was so nice to have a larger vehicle to travel in.  My kids enjoyed it and were much more comfortable and so were my husband and I.  Just having the ability to change seats and move around made the trip much nicer.  Also, the back seat folds all the way down and after driving 12 hours I folded that seat down and crashed out for a few hours while hubby drove.  No, that's not the safest thing and it's not something I recommend doing...but, it is a nice feature and I slept really good!!
