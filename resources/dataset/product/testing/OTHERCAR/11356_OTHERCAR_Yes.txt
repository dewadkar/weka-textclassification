            Our 1999 Dodge Caravan is awesome! It has plenty of room for the whole family. We took a trip from North Carolina to Texas and it did wonderful! The seats in the middle and back move back &amp; forth with ease. Be careful when taking them out of the van as they are a bit heavy &amp; require two people for that task! 
The fourth door is so helpful! No more crawling through to get out &amp; having to move around the carseat just to get out of the van! The built in carseats for children over 20 pounds are a great help, especially when visitors want to ride in your van but they don't have a carseat with them! 
We were rear-ended &amp; all that happened was, the tailpipe got bent! What a strong back end!! 
Our van has a 20 gallon gas tank and we usually get about 20 miles per gallon.
We have power windows and power locks. Once you start driving, the doors automatically lock at about 20 miles per hour.
Do you have children that will be riding in the back? This van is equipped with a child protection door lock system. To activate it, you simply move the switch (located near the door latch) to the lock position.
A feature I also love is the power vent window option. There are two switches on the drivers door to open the far back windows. The windows can also be manually opened simply by releasing the lever and pushing the window open. It only opens a few inches but is enough to let a nice breeze in.
We have a driver side as well as a passenger side air bag. Remember, the front seat is no place for an infant seat or a small child.
The exterior mirrors are hinged so they may be moved forward or backward to help when driving through a tight space. To adjust the mirror itself, use the switch located on the drivers side door.
There are 6 cup holders in our van too. This makes it nice while going on long trips!Price depends on the options you get. Ours was a program car &amp; had some miles so it might have been cheaper than other similar models.
