              I drove a mercedes 300E for 14 years that's the longest time I
had ever owned any car domestic or foreign. Finally I traded it in for a C230. I was dazzled by how beautiful it looked, inside was leather insert interior most comfortable seats. There are 2 cups holder that can be hidden inside the divider compartments ,very convenient for someone
on the go as I am.
   The glass sunroof is very unique, it can be opened 3 different ways
to get air, fully open or just get the sun shining through the glass.
   I love the easy maneuverbility as I have arthritis and had a hard time steering the 300E. This model is turbo charged( called kompressor
in German, it zoomed from 150 to 189 HP in a short time.
   I love the gas mileage, i get 23 MPG combined driving and service is required only at 7,500 miles and even less frequent later.
   The back seat could open/collapse in the middle to allow storage of ski equipments from the trunk.
   The minor cons to this beauty is 1)the gas fuel sensor,in Calif the 
additives to the gas cause the sensor to be destroyed, I just had it replaced at 3,500 miles and I was told the problem is corrected.
   2)The rear view mirror has a light dimmer sensor, I did not like it
as it impeded the view, I taped with a black tape and got rid of this problem.
Anybody who likes a luxury car at an affordable price should consider this model. I had 2 rear ended accidents with my 300E and came out with not even a scratch on my body, no whiplash, barely noticeable on the mercedes.
Mercedes,class ,beauty and elegance for the people who love and want to preserve life !! MERCEDES UEBER ALLES!!!!
