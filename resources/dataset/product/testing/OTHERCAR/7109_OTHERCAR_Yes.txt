            This year, 1999, is the tenth anniversary of the Miata. For the first nine years, they didn't make substantive changes in the Miata. Now, they've corrected the few things that made prior model year owners a little crazy. For instance, the rear window is no longer made out of easily scratchable plastic, it's now glass with defroster coils in it. They'e changed the stereo so the dashboard has a single tape *and* a single CD slot (not one or the other). You can get an option of the wind-guard, behind the seats, which stops air circling back around as it passes overhead and messing up your hair. For those of you who want to put a child in your Miata but concerned about your air bag, you can turn off the passenger air bag with a key. They've also souped up the engine a bit, so it's even faster off the line. They've redesigned the trunk--moved the gas tank a little bit and put the spare tire under the trunk, so there's 1.5 times as much cubic feet of trunk space. They also changed the front headlights; they no longer pop up and are really stylish looking, unobtrusive almond shaped headlights. The MSRP is $26,875 for the tenth anniversary edition, which is about four thousand dollars more than what the older model cost a few years ago. It's worth it, and it's one of the least expensive roadsters available. The Miata has great road feel, unlike the BMW Z3, which doesn't have that sports car feel even though it costs five grand more. (Even though the Miata has a smaller engine, it's still faster off the line than the 2.3 liter BMW Z3) I really feel like I've got a grip on the road. The steering is super responsive. I have confidence I know what this car can do. Options you can't do without: the wind guard and audio speakers in the headrests. Options you can do without: the M package, with its goofy detailing, leather fob on gearshift, and M in cursive sewn onto your leather seats.<br>
