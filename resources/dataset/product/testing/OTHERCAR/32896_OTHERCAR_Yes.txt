            Great photo quality, especially when you consider the camera size.  Resolution is ideal for people like me who frequently post on the web.   Even though high-res prints came out beautifully, as well.

HOWEVER...
The auto-focus/auto white-balance/auto-exposure function takes so long in "auto" mode, that you are sure to "automatically"  miss any moment in time you may be attempting to catch.  I found this out over Christmas while trying to capture the many  precocious antics of my 2-year-old niece.  Ever try to ask a 2-year-old to "hold that pose?"  Yeah.  Most of my photos were blurry shots of the back of her head, thanks to delays that were sometimes up to two seconds between hitting the button and hearing the shutter go off.

Shutter speed is much more reactive in manual mode, but you must adjust white balance and exposure by toggling the same key back and forth between adjustment modes.  Again, not very conducive to spontaneous photography.  I did, however, get some fantastic photos of a vase of roses in natural light.  I guess my point is this is NOT the camera you want to take to your child's soccer game,  to take pictures of small children, to take to a wedding, or any other venue where you might miss a one-in-a-million moment.  Photos of sleeping pets, inanimate objects (in our case one and the same), or landscapes are just fine, and the results are very good.  

Still, I am very happy with my camera, though not quite prepared to throw out my 35mm just yet.
