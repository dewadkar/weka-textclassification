            I got the PDR-M5 as a Christmas gift from my husband. I had wanted a digital camera for my birthday in October, but we just couldn't decide on which one to get when we were shopping for one. He went out shopping by himself after that and talked to many people, finally deciding on this camera. 

I think if you are in the market for a digital camera, it is definitely worth your money to get as many pixels as possible. The lower-end cameras are just not worth it. 

This camera has many great features. I love the pop-up flash, the zoom, wide angle, macro, etc. It takes pictures that are very sharp. The first pictures that I emailed to a group of friends came back with many comments about how clear the picture was, and comments such as WOW I wish my camera took pictures like that!

I also like the fact that you can take shots in different resolutions, depending on how high a quality you need the picture to be, and also how many pictures you need to fit on your media card. The camera tells you how many pictures you can still fit on the card, at each of the resolutions.

It's very easy to get the pictures to your computer. Just install the software that comes with the camera, and hook up by USB or Serial Port to download them.

Another GREAT feature is that it comes with a video out jack and cord that you can plug right into your tv to see the pictures. We have a 61&quot; big screen tv, and when putting the pictures on the tv, we expected to loose some of the sharpness, blowing them up so big, but they were amazingly clear, sharp, and clean. One way I think we'll use this feature is to keep all of our vacation pictures on a separate media card, and look at them as a slide show on the tv. 

This camera will also take video clips, but does not record sound as other cameras do. You can add sound later if you download them using the software, and recording an audio clip  through your computer to go with the picture.

Even though we've had this camera only a short time, I know already it was a good choice. When using it at the family Christmas gatherings, I could tell everyone was pretty impressed with it.

Another great use for a digital camera is if you sell items on ebay or other auction sites. Taking a picture with a digital camera, downloading it into your computer, and then deleting it off the media card, saves LOTS of money compared to buying film, developing film, having to scan the photos, and then throwing them away after the item sells. That is a waste of money!I plan to do a lot more selling on ebay now that I have a digital camera!<br><br>
