            I am a 21 year old female college student. When I was 17 my mother was the first in our neighborhood to own a RAV4.  I drove it sparingly, but didn't think too much of it.  Four years later I was in the market for a small SUV, and after reading Consumers Digest and visiting several car dealers and test driving many small SUVs, my undisputable choice became the RAV4 (2000 model). It wasn't the rugged good looks of the vehicle (although they didn't hurt), but it was the roomy interior, the smooth ride, and the feeling of safety. I also liked the fact that the vehicle is big enough to carry many things and make its presence known on the road without being bulky or obnoxious. Plus, I wanted the looks of an SUV, but the comfort of a car.  There are times where I would rather sleep in my car than in my own bed. Consider this: I drive 2 hours each way between NJ and PA, and never feel cramped or sore after getting out of the car. I have had the RAV4 for about 8 months now and have racked up over 15,000 miles because I drive back and forth from Jersey to Pennsylvania every week. I have driven through this season's worst weather.  I have driven through Tropical Storm Floyd and the worst snow that Northeastern Pennsylvania has thrown at us.  And through it all I have noticed that while other cars seem to be struggling, I am passing them all by, seemingly oblivious to the treacherous weather that surrounds me, singing at the top of my lungs, and just feeling SAFE. My philosophy is this: a car should get you from point A to point B.  Weather shouldn't make anyone afraid of getting anywhere - and I have never felt afraid in this car. I can also &quot;stop on a dime&quot; in this car. I've had some close calls because of other drivers, but my brakes have saved me. And I don't even have anti-lock brakes! There are some drawbacks like the way the back door opens up. I would rather see it lift up than swing to the right.  And I would also like to see better cupholders and more room to put little things (like spare change for tolls).  It also can be a little noisy given its height, but I believe it to be tolerable.  My boyfriend is 6 feet tall, and he loves the fact that he can wear a baseball cap, and still have enough head room. Also if you're a faster driver, don't worry about it being slow - I've kept up with the best of them on Rt. 80 - taking the curves of the Delaware Water Gap area (between Jersey and PA) going 60 mph and NEVER felt like I was going to tip. This car handles smooth and tight. The pick-up speed could be better, but once up to speed, it gives ALL other cars a run for their money. Oh and cruise control works great to. I've never been one for cruise control, but I feel comfortable using it in this car. The bottom line is this: if you want a SAFE, FUN, ECONOMICAL, COMFORTABLE SUV with minimal drawbacks - the RAV4 is for you. <br><br>
