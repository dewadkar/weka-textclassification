            I just bought mine a month ago, and I can't put it down. This is my first digital camera and it is so easy to use. The pictures are excellent in clarity and easy to view on the LCD screen. I love being able to see my pictures first hand, instead of waiting to get the film developed. Itï¿½s perfect for people who sell items on the internet and for e-mailing photos to friends and family. My only suggestion would be to invest in rechargeable batteries. This camera eats batteries, as most digital cameras do. An excellent camera for first time users like me!<br><br>
