            When I decided that a digital camera was a &quot;toy&quot; that I needed I began my search for the right product at the right price. 

After a few weeks of research I found the right product and the right price, the Kodak DC-240. We all know Kodak as the compact &quot;throw it away&quot; camera and I never even thought of Kodak for a digital camera, but I am glad I did.  After testing the Sony,Olympus,and Toshiba here is why I paid for the DC-240.  First, the zoom capability is a 2X digital Zoom AND a 3X Optical Zoom. Any of you who are new to this type of photography should know that the digital zoom on your camera is worthless, and you need to get a unit with the right amount of optical zoom that works for you.  The 3X optical zoom works just fine by me. Using the camera is very comfortable, it is a little heavier than the others, but not a problem.
 
I read many opinions that talk about &quot;nose smear&quot; on the LCD display, and although the LCD is right where your nose would be, so far this has not been a issue.  In the end any camera is about the photo, and I have been extremely pleased with the quality JPEG images that I have captured.  The camera comes out of the box ready to point and shoot and contains an 8MB compact flash card.  On the highest resolution and best quality, the card holds about 17 shots, on mid-resolution about 60 shots, and on low...well on I never used the lowest quality.  Here is the bonus, the unit comes with a set of rechargeable batteries and charger and just to get you going as soon as you open the box, Kodak gives you one set of standard batteries so you can use your camera while you are charging. 

The manual is outstanding and written in plain english and you will be shooting great shots in less than ten minutes.  This unit has a myriad of menu options loaded right on the camera,add borders,the date and a few other things. 
Loading images to your PC is a snap with the USB connection, which also comes with the camera.  With all good there is some bad...the lens cap.  Although it is connected to camera (so you dont lose it) it fits the camera very loose and has a tendency to fall off when you are carrying the camera.  
The price, well I got mine for $429 on the internet, but I have seen this unit priced for about $499 in many retail stores.
Don't think of Kodak as the disposable brand anymore, I am extremely happy with this unit.<br><br>
