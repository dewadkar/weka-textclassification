            I've owned and used over two dozen digital cameras in my life, and I received the HP PhotoSmart 318xi as a promotion through work. Here are my impressions:

<b>First Look</b>
HP is known for their excellent packaging, instructions and bundled software. The 318xi is no exception. This is a friendly device to own. The camera itself is extremely simple and intuitive to use. No complaints about operation. It feels cheap however, and I imagine it won't withstand a rahter small drop... :(

<b>Using it</b>
I tried it once with the onboard 8MB RAM. Needless to say, this is not enough. You get 113 pictures in good mode, 16 in medium mode, and 7 in excellent mode. Not nearly enough. I popped in a spare 128MB card I had lying around. Much better. You get 1900+ pictures in good mode, 270+ in medium and 130+ in excellent. I recommend buying and upgraded Compact Flash memory card if you purchase this unit.

Taking pictures was easy enough, and navigating the various menus was a breeze. However, time between pictures is rather slow, especially in the higher resolutions.

The LCD display is rather slow, and grainy. I haven't used a full set of batteries yet, but I imagine they drain much faster using the screen. One recommendation is to purchase rechargable NiMH (Nickel Metal-hydride) batteries. They're inexpenive, and tend to last 4 or 5 times longer than Alkaline. Almost as long as Lithium AA batteries.

Downloading pictures to the computer was easy and painless thanks to the great software HP provides. You can make some minor adjustments via the software.

<b>Picture Quality</b>
This is where the camera exhibits it's weakest link. I felt the pictures were horrific. The color is very washed out and bluish, they also appeared grainy, even at high resolutions. At the highest level (which I believe is a whopping 1792x1200 pixels), detail was still lost. The flash only did an adequate job. 

As a reference, compared to either the Canon PowerShot S110 or S300, these pictures looked horrible. I would spend the extra money and go with the Canon. Even Fuji has better quality at a very similar price. However, as a consolation, I felt the Fuji line has awful software. The Canon has adequate software, but not nearly as good as the HP.

Keep in mind, I received this as a gift.

<b>Conclusion</b>
I don't feel this is a terrible package per se, because of it's many redeeming qualities. However, I thought the picture to be unacceptable, especially indoors. If you're exclusively using it as a throwaround, perhaps an outdoor camera, the price just may be right.

But for a few hard-earned dollars more, I feel that you'd get more value and bang for your buck with a Canon. Elph series. Those are just beautifully designed masterpieces which take stunning pictures you'll get incredible compliments on.
