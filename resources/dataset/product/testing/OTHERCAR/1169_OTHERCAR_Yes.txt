            I purchased a 2000 Dodge Neon base-model in July of 2001 a few weeks before my 18th birthday.  I loved the looks & styling of the car.  It was previously used as a rental car & had 16,000 miles on it.  It is now Jan. 2004 and has 88,000 miles on it.  It's currently in my uncle's shop being worked on b/c the engine coolent leaked.  This is really the first problem I've had w/ the car.  When I first bought it I had to take it to the dealership a few times for warranty work.  The brake hose needed to be replaced at about 20k and I took it in a few times for "sqeaky brakes".  The mechanic said that there was nothing they could find wrong w/ the brakes & that Neons are just prone to squeak.  It wasn't too long after that I brought my car to Les Schwab to have the tires replaced & they told me that my brake pads were so thin I shouldn't even be driving.  I immediately took it to a local mechanic & had the break pads replaced & the rotors cleaned.  I havn't had any braking problems since except for the irritating sqeal.  Overall it's been a good little car.  No major mechanical problems so far.  It's got great pick up and handles very well compared to my other cars.  My first car was a BMW and it handled great.  I believe my Neons handling is just as good or better.  My second car was a Kia Rio.  I bought it brand new in June of 2001, totalled it 3 weeks later.  BAD handling on the Kia, very bad.  The Neon is much much better on corners and turns.  Here is my rundown:

Pros: Good pickup, handling, reliability, big cup holders, trunk space, heater is quick to heat up & defrost, A/C works very well, good braking/stopping distance, good stock stereo speakers

Cons: Poor rear visability, no power doors/locks on the Highline Sedan, no ciagarette lighter or ashtray, 3 cupholders in front one in center console box and 0 in back, bad gas mileage, noisy engine, door/window molding coming loose, crappy dashboard paint peels, uncomfy seats on longer drives, water leaks into car when raining if window is cracked or open a little, lame tape player-no standard CD player, only comes in a 4 door sedan model, not many options for this model, no cruise control, no securty/alarm features, brakes sqeal, quirky interior light, no arm rest, extremely poor resale value.
