            Im a Nissan guy. I have owned 7 of them, I'm hooked, and I admit it, so I'm a bit biased. Fact is Nissan has been making more powerful, less expensive cars than their japanese competitors for, well, for forever. 

My new maxima is the ultimate car for "Dad." What do I mean by that? Plenty of room for the kids and all their stuff. A killer Bose audio system, leather seats, 17 inch alloy wheels and 255, count em, 255 horsies under the hood! Wow.

After dropping off the kids at school/functions etc, I like to ride around doing my dad chores and blowing little kids in their Camaros, Supras, Avengers and daddy's BMWs or Benz's right off the road. There isn't another 4 door that can touch it. There are cars out there with more horsepower, but none as light as the Maxima. It has the best horsepower to curb weight ratio going - and that means watching the competition in the rearview. Ok, ok, so it won't take the 5.0 Mustang or the Vette - but hey those guys can't drive around with 3 kids and and 4 sets of golf bags can they?

When I'm not reliving my childhood racing fantasies, I relax in the wonderful leather seats. The ride is smooth and quiet. The in-dash 6 cd changer rocks. The steering is tight and the SE package delivers excellent handling. 

The only flaw in the car is the 6-speed manual shifter. It is clunky as heck. The 6-speed is a new thing for Nissan, so I am going to write it off as something they will improve upon. Once you get used to it, it isn't bad, but the learning curve for shifting it right is pretty steep. They need to reengineer that sucker.

I love my Maxima so much I might even keep it when the lease is up (unless they keep boosting the horsepower :-)

Oh, did I mention that for all the fun it is and how practical it is, its cheap too. I got mine at invoice for like 26,900. hot dang!!! Keep your Lexus - I have a car thats better, stronger and faster and I paid 10-20 large less for it!!
