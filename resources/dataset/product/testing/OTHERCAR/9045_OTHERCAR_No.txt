            My friend bought this car and he thought it would be quite a bang for the buck.  And boy was he wrong!

You can hear all the little squeaks and squggles this car makes, probably from pieces not fitting right together, and bad craftsmanship.  The sportage also feels really weak; like if you ran into another car like a REAL SUV, it would crumple under you, injuring all inside.  So I try to ride with my other friendswhen goin somewhere.  Not saying that my sportage friend is a bad driver, I just feel unsafe in the particular car.

The looks are OK if you ask me.  Nothing special, just normal SUV styling.  I see alot of kids in my neghborhood driving around with their sunlenses thinking that they are sooooo cool with their Sportage and it really makes me laugh because they are basing it only on looks.  And the Kia Sportage has alot more problems that need to be addressed.

It is stocked matching the purchase price, which is not that much.  The handling is fair, yet it rolls back and forth, feeling as if you are goin to tip over at any turn.  And like I said before, these things make is an SUV you DON'T feel safe in.

So if you're on the market for a cheap SUV, try a Honda CRV or the like INSTEAD of the Kia Sportage.  (Kia's advertisment that the Sportage can out-perform a CRV also makes me chorkle)<br><br>
