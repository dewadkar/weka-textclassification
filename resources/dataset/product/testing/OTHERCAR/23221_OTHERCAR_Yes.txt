            We bought our Plymouth Breeze two years ago and have loved it ever since.  It caught our eye the moment we saw it on the lot.  It's a silvery purple color (they called it Iris) and it's just a sporty looking little car.  

It's very roomy inside and handles like a dream.  We've taken it on several long road trips and haven't had a moments trouble with it.  It's very comfortable and I would take it anywhere.  

My Breeze has plenty of leg room in the front and back seats.  The back is plenty big enough for my three kids to fit comfortably and they're all at the age to where they don't want to be touching each other while riding in the car.  So, the extra room in the back comes in handy.  There is also a very large trunk which holds all of our junk on those long road trips that we've been on.  

My Breeze is a joy to drive and I'd definitely recommend it to all my friends. <br><br>
