            I purchased my 1997 Plymouth Neon Coupe when I was 21 years old. I was excited as this was the first new car I had ever owned. I was attracted by the sporty look, peppy engine and low price. 

I did some phone shopping to several dealers and found one with a deal I could not pass up. My father drove me to the dealership and we completed the deal for my new car. 

I began having problems about a week after I purchased the car. First, the air conditioner went out. Keep in mind the car was only a week old with about 400 miles on it. I took it in to the dealer and they couldn't find anything wrong so they re-charged the A/C and sent me on my way. Two months later the car would not start...Back to the dealer. They diagnosed a bad fuel pump but they didn't have the part to fix it, car was in the shop for a week. A month later...car wouldn't start again, kept stalling. Back to the dealer. This time the cam shaft sensor had gone out. In the meantime the A/C had quit working again and still they couldn't find anything wrong with it. The next blow was the power steering going out and a blown head gasket. This was all within a year of purchasing the car, BRAND NEW!

Over the next few years, I had to replace two more head gaskets, the air conditioner never worked, the engine overheated when idling, constantly leaked oil to the point where I was putting oil in every week, power steering went out when I drove through puddles, brakes squeaked incessantly, trim moulding and plastic pieces fell off, numerous leaks and did I mention A/C???????

Now, I am not a careless person. I did everything in my power (oil changes, tune-ups, etc.) to keep this car going smoothly, yet it betrayed me. I am concerned that every Neon on the road is a potential lemon and I will never buy another Chrysler product again.

I recently traded in my Neon for a new Honda Civic and frankly, I feel soooo bad for the person who buys that lemon.

I would not recommend this car to anyone!!!
