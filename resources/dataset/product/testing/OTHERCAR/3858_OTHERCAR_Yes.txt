               I have had a few different &quot;Luxury Cars&quot; and never really wanted a Sport Vehicle...till I got my Yukon, and it is the nicest &quot;luxury car&quot; I've had!
   Husband wanted a Suburban. I test drove one and found they were just too much car for me. Dealer asked us if we would like to test a Yukon....we did and loved it!
   The Yukon is exactly the same car as the Suburban only it's 18&quot; shorter! Much easier to park too. We purchased this car because we thought it would be a safe car when it came to driving between Arizona and California. The car is very comfortable and very roomy. It drives like a dream...almost by itself...plus you are higher than most other vehicles on the road and can see over them. 
    I always feel very safe in this car whenever I'm alone, or whenever I'm driving the 350 miles to Ca.  The only problem I have had is the windshield. I'm on my fourth one because of all the rocks that 18 wheelers throw up. 
    I feel this would be a good car for mothers with little children.
