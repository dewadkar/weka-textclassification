                 My husband and I purchased this camera to use to put pictures on the net and also for personal use. It's so much easier to download and print the pictures you want without worrying about not having film or being stuck with a lot of pictures that didn't turn out right.
     There are a lot of pros with this camera. It takes excellent pictures with great detail, It is easy to use once you familiarize yourself with it and it is easy to hook up to the computer to work with the pictures. Just about anyone would benefit from using this product. You don't have to be a &quot;technical&quot; person. This camera is very user friendly.
     We chose this product over the competition because it took the best quality pictures. After researching it on the web and asking people who had digital cameras this one kept coming up. Kodak is a leading company name when it comes to photography so we trusted it to have a good camera.
     There are also some cons with this camera. it is bigger than a lot of the cameras on the market. If you want a camera that is the same size as a regular 35 millimeter this is not the one for you. The batteries drain very quickly. The camera does come with 1 set of rechargeable batteries and a charger, but this can be very inconvenient when you aren't using the camera at home. Also, I have heard from professional photographers that the speed of this camera is a lot slower than 35 millimeter.
     The one accessory that we bought with this camera was an expansion system. It has an adapter that connects the picture card by itself with the computer. This is good if someone else needs the camera, then you keep just the picture card to work with. it also includes another set of batteries, another picture card and the software needed to do the basics with the pictures (editing and downloading). This accessory gives you everything you would need to get started with the camera.<br><br>
