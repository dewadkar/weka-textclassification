            My old Toyota Corolla was dying so it was time to look into a new vehicle.  I test drove several others (Acura, Honda, Saturn, Toyota)but wanted something sportier yet not a sports cars.  The Jetta met my criteria in terms of looks, but I apparently overlooked a lot.  

1. Everything rattles.  And I mean everything.  The cup holder, the glove compartment, the seatbelts, the head rest on the passenger seat.  Which means that my quiet ride isn't so quiet.

2. Shifting out of reverse.  I always thought that when you shift an automatic from reverse to drive, the car should go forward.  It doesn't.  It likes to continue to go in reverse for another second.  I'm just waiting for that to cause me an accident. The dealer had no idea why.  Also,the engine revs extremely high between 20-30 miles per hour.  It doesn't like to shift in that range which means the ride is even noisier.

3. Disappearing hubcaps.  They don't stay on.  Every time I hit a bump, and all Massachusetts (especially Boston) streets are lousy, I lose a hubcap.  I'm tempted to take them all off and throw them in the trunk. I've gone through 3 in 8 months of owning the car. 

4. The AM tuner on the radio is very weak.  Ok, so maybe I was spoiled having a Japanese radio prior, but I could pull in stations from New York.  Now I have trouble keeping the main news station in Boston tuned in.  And I live 3 miles from Boston!

5. The gas mileage is lousy.  When I bought the car, I was led to expect I'd be getting 22-28 miles per gallon.  I could live with that.  I've broken 20 miles to a gallon on only those occasions where I've driven on the highway for an extended amount of time (and then the top was 24 mpg).  City driving/local roads, expect in the 14-16 mpg range.  Even if you're not in stop and go traffic (which I am not in my commute to work.

6. And lastly, the service hours at the local VW dealers are lousy.  M-F and closed on the weekends.  My Toyota dealer was open on Sat. which meant I didn't need to either miss a day of work or rent a car to get to work while I didn't have my car.

7. To update this - the Jetta is not worth looking at when considering a new car.  Since I wrote this opinion, I've had it in the shop three times.  Once to replace a tie rod which was not under warranty which meant I had to shell out $500 for parts and labor.  Another time for excessive play in the steering which was caused by unusual wear on the front ball joints, which according to the service manager, would not normally be covered under the poor 2yr 24K mile warranty, the driver side mirror defroster stopped working in the middle of January (which is convenient in New England)and most recently, a week before my 20th month of Jetta ownership (on a 36 mo. lease), the passenger side front window fell into the door.  The glass didn't break, this wasn't the result of an accident.  Nothing.  The window was opened to let some air in and it just fell straight down into the door with a resounding "CLUNK".  And VW service is saying that it may not be covered under what's left of the warranty depending on what they find. 

8.  A new update to the Jetta saga - Beware of brakes wearing out.  I now have 27,100 miles on my '99 Jetta and had to have all 4 rotors replaced plus pads.  The pads I can understand, but four rotors?  I don't do city driving, my commute to and from work is 9 miles on a road with 3 stop lights and a 40mph limit.  And it's straight so I'm not braking to go around corners.  Of course my lease is up in 5 months and of course it's no longer under warranty and of course this is CONSIDERED NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR.  But VW service informed me that VW has built in obsolesence in the braking system - when the brakes need to be replaced, it's not just pads, it's ALWAYS rotors as well.  And that's an extra $750 in VW's pocket on every car they make.  Never again will I lease (or buy) a VW product.  I have already talked 3 friends out of even looking at any VW when they got new cars over the last 3-6 months and I encourage others to avoid them too.

9.  Just had the first recall on my car to replace the oxygen sensor in the fuel tank.  Apparently it'll fail meaning that the gas/oxygen ratio gets screwed up which means worse gas mileage.   Worse?  How can it get worse then the 20 mpg I've gotten (highway) since I got the car 2 1/2 years ago.  It did get worse - dropped to 15 mpg (highway).  And it only took 2 weeks for service to have a opening to fix it.  Gas mileage is back up to about 20. 

10.  Ok, now I'm hearing of another recall on my car because the fuel tank can be "damaged" (read: explode) if you get a flat tire.  That's nice.  I've had two flats and I guess I've been very lucky.  I can't wait to get the recall letter in the mail for this one and have to schedule a month in advance for service to replace the wheel well liner with a stronger one.  My lease is up in 5 mos. (not that I'm counting) and I can't wait to get out of this car.  Never again will I drive a VW product.

11.  The conclusion - I'm finally out of my lease.  I bought out of it a month early when I found a new car (see my 2002 RAV4 review).  I'm waiting on my final bill from VW, which I'm sure they'll charge me for assumed excess mileage (I turned it in 17 miles over my lease limit, but I'm sure they will pro-rata that and I'll have to argue that I had a new car before this was turned in).  I have steered 4 friends away from VW products and I hope that my bad experiences will influence others as well.
