            I bought this vehicle after quite a bit of research, my budget was quite limited at the time and I needed to buy a reliable vehicle that could haul two kids and all of their stuff to and from school, make long trips and be driven every day.  It took awhile to get the car, simply because I was negotiating with two different dealers for a long time.  For any new car buyers out there, read on to hear the testimonial of how you can manipulate the car dealer.  

I originally set out to buy a regular minivan, but as I wheeled and dealed with the two different dealers, I actually got the grand option for free, a $700 dollar value!  I also got a high end stereo, CD changer, and extended warrantee added on to my original hopes.  From what the listed price was to what I actually paid for it was a dramatic difference of a couple thousand dollars.  I kid you not.  

This car has catered to my demands, with a few discoveries along the way... some good, some bad.  All of the seats are advertised to be able to be removed easily.  This is only half true.  With two people, the back seat is a breeze to remove, it really is, the two captain chairs, however, are another story.  Not only are they much heavier than they look, they hook onto a metal bar on the floor of the car and in order to remove the seat you must tilt the seat forward quite a bit.  

They are also difficult to remove because of the awkwardness of their shape, there's really no way to get a good grip onto them.  Don't get me started on the ordeal it is to put them back in, it involves much twisting tilting and shoving to get the hook on the chair to latch onto the bar on the floor.  In fact, one time when I was driving and a passenger was sitting the chair, he leaned over the arm and the whole thing came undone and the seat came loose.  If you are not hauling around many large items, you don't really need to remove the seats, the back has plenty of room.  

I love the way the car drives.  For a minivan it has great acceleration.  I find I can go from a stop to merging speed on the interstate very easily as well as pass quickly.  The accelerator is touchy, but with my experience with new cars, it seems all cars are now being that way.  The turning radius is amazing.  Granted here in Toledo, Ohio, the spaces were not designed solely for GeoMetros, but all the same, I find it easy to maneuver in and out of tight parking.  Bgrayduck, the previous reviewer, is correct in her assertion that there are cup holders everywhere.  There are two for the driver and passenger, two for the captain chairs, and a total of four in the back.  2+2+4=8 cup holders for a vehicle that carries a maximum of 7 people.  

The high end stereo is not that impressive in it's look, and often times I find it responds slowly to commands, but you can't argue with its functioning.  I have never heard the disk skip, and when the car is turned off and back on the CD restarts in the exact same time when you left off.  The speakers are good quality.  I have had the stereo up loud in the past, 17 year old loud, not 45 year old loud, and it retains the same quality, refuses to pop crackle or sound airy.  

I have put almost 41,000 miles on this car in only 2 years, which besides terrifying me, should be evidence to you that this is a solid car that can take all you want from it.  There is one other beef I've got with this automobile, a serious one at that.  In December 1999 I was involved in a collision with a stationary object at 30+ miles per hour.  The object made hard contact with the front driver side area.  It shattered and destroyed the light system on that side, crushed the front side panel, and dented the side of the hood.  The collision shoved the side panel into the washer fluid tank and completely ruptured it.  The vans airbags did Not deploy, and though this was not a serious accident, I walked away with no injuries or ill effects, it surprised me nonetheless.  

The aftermath of the incident resulted in over $6000 worth of damage and has caused a number of problems for the car.  The steering wheel-wheel alignment system was completely screwed up.  In order to drive straight, the wheel had to be turned about 40-50 degrees right of center.  There have also been strange clicking noises coming from the car during driving.  It has been a long ordeal with numerous trips to the shop to remedy it.  The dealer never really seemed to figure out what was wrong.  The alignment problem was fixed, but a couple months went by before the noises stopped.  I even had to have a copilot attached to my car and had to learn how to use it.  It is a device that records the ongoings of the car at the instant you press a button.  The idea is to press the button when you hear the sound, but it is hard to do, and did not seem to help the situation at all.  

All in all, I have been very pleased with the running of this car.  It was the right price and had the right features for me.  Like anyone, I found the repair cost to be disagreeable, but hey, that's life.  The airbags failing to deploy worries me, but the car handles well in rough whether and is safer than an SUV.  I recommend this car, but take that with a bit of salt for my personal uncertainty about the reliability of the safety features.  <br><br>
