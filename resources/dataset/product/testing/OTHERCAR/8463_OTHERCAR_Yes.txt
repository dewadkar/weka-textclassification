            Personally, I own the Olympus C2500L, and I'm slapping my hand to keep from buying the E-10--I figure I should hold out for the next round of upgrades.  But six months after I purchased my C2500L we decided to invest in a really decent digital camera at the high school where I work.  We needed a camera to do PR work--email photos to the newspaper, etc.  My co-worker thought we should try something different from what we already had access to--I had read about the C3030--liked the idea of the 3.3 megapixels.  So I ordered the camera with accessories--a card reader--extra 32mb smartmedia card, and a battery charger and a couple of sets of rechargeable batteries.  
   I was immediately impressed with the quality of the pictures.  They are beautiful.  We use digital photography a lot at our school--for fun, PR, educational purposes.  I take a lot of shots of the kids--learning in the classrooms,participating in sports--and we plaster those photos all over the bulletin boards.  Kids and parents love to see the pictures.  This camera REALLY impressed me with its performance at PROM.  I was able to walk into a VERY DARK gym and just point the camera at dancing kids and get some pretty decent pictures.  My C2500L does NOT have that kind of low light capability or quality.  I had to get used to the slight lag in shutter reaction on this camera.  My Olympus C2500L is billed as a "digital SLR" and reacts like one--it is pretty easy to adjust exposure, shutter is fast, etc.  This camera does NOT do the macro work that can be done with the C2500L--I actually pull out the Sony Mavicas at work if I need a macro camera (never thought I'd say that at this stage of the game). I had to learn to allow for the lag when taking sports pictures.  But all in all we have been VERY pleased with the camera.  I don't use the software that came with it.  I downloaded and paid for Compupic--which I like because it is fast and simple.  I think a card reader is the ONLY way to go with these cameras. Again--fast and simple.  I am tempted to buy one of these for my own personal snapshot needs--times when I don't want to mess with the C2500L.  The pictures are almost a megapixel better. It is a wonderful point and shoot camera.
