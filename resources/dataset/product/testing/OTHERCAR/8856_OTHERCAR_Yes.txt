            Flat out, this is a great car.  I recently got a new 2000 Honda Accord EX, and I love it.  My previous car was a Honda Passport, which served it's purpose, and did what I got it for (winter driving), but I did not realize how much fun driving a car could be until I got in my new Honda Accord.  I used to hate driving places because my car would use so much gas and I really didn't feel safe driving it (the Passport).  Now, I love driving everyone anywhere they want to go, and I feel like this car is an extension of me.  This car has a pretty large gas tank (around 16 gallons), and gets great gas mileage (about 350-400 miles per fill-up)!  My Passport had over a 20 gallon gas tank and barely got 200 miles per tank.

I love everything about this car, the CD player, the comfortable seats, the retractable sunroof (not available in all versions), the sunglass holder, the cup holders, the back seat access to the trunk, the ability to lock the trunk so the valet key won't open it.  So many great features, and I haven't even talked about the ride of it yet.  Smooth as silk, that is how well it rides.  I recommend this car to anyone who wants an affordable joy ride.<br><br>
