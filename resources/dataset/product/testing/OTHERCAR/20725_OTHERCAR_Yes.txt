            Overall, the Chevy Blazer is a good piece of machinery.  It rides nice compared to most other SUV's and has the same if not more than enough cargo space than comparable SUV's.  The Blazer will giddy up if you give it some gas, but like most American cars, it doesn't get the best gas mileage.  

My friends and I have no problem with my parent's Blazer when we take it for ski trips.  We easily fit four adults and LOTS of luggage in with some room to spare.  The backseats are plenty big for the girls, but are a little small for me and my friend.  We ride comfortably up front though.  

One problem that I have seen in my dad's mechanic shop is with Chevy's four wheel drive vehicles.  I would venture to say that at least 75% of all Chevy four wheel drives are leaking somewhere after about 40,000 miles.  The problem usually begins with the left front axle seal on the front drivetrain.  The worst part about this problem is that it usually happens just after the warranty runs out.  At least this is what happens to most people that come into my dad's shop.

Just something to think about when you are purchasing a 4x4 Blazer.

Chevy Blazers are probably one of the cheaper Full size SUV's on the market, especially compared to the luxury ones.
