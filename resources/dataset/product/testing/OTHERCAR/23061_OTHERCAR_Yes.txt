            After trying a less expensive camera that produced poor quality photos, I purchased the Polaroid 640. Every time I use it I am still amazed at the beautiful pictures it produces. I found that learning to use the camera was so easy. It comes with every thing you need to get started and the photo max cd is great for editing your photo and much more. The large window on the back of the camera lets you review your photo after you take it and keep or delete it. It has a built in flash and auto focus. 
Transferring your pictures to your computer is very simple with this camera.I tried a less expensive camera and was very disappointed with the grainy fuzzy pictures I produced. With the Polaroid 640 I can get the best quality pictures even when enlarged and printed on paper. I have never been more pleased with a product. I would recommend this camera to anyone. The size of the camera is perfect for taking anywhere. You can get the best pictures without spending a lot of money with this camera. I have several friends and relatives that also have purchased this camera and you couldn't talk them into changing for nothing. Try it! You'll be very pleased.<br><br>
