            I DON'T WANT TO OWN A MINIVAN!!!! That was my always my biggest fear. I did NOT want to be the owner of one, EVER! But when # 4 child is on the way, what other choice did I have? (In our price range anyway) I would have LOVED a SUV, but when you have 3 kids at home, and a 1 income family, that was out of the question. SO, we went and looked at minivans.

We found a 1998 Dodge Caravan. I must say, that it is GREAT to have so much room! My oldest no longer has to be squished between his brother's car seat, and his sister's booster seat. I really was feeling sorry for him. I traded in a Pontiac Grand Am on my van. Going from a sporty looking car to a &quot;mom~mobile&quot; was ROUGH :O) But I must say that it rides wonderful, there is plenty of leg room even in the back for adults. It has a 6 cylinder engine that still &quot;gets up and goes&quot;.

The only thing that I wish we had gotten was the dual sliding doors. It really is rough to try to reach across the seat to unbuckle a car seat. I tried putting him by the door, but then my son couldn't crawl over the car seat to get to the other side. So the dual sliding door would be great. 

I will never say that I LOVE my minivan, as I always proclaimed that I would &quot;never own one&quot; But I do have to say, if you have a large family, it really is nice to have.<br><br>
