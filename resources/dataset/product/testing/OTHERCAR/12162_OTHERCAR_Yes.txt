            <b>Update 4/17/01:  I've now owned my SC400 for four and a half years, and if anything, I appreciate it more now than the day I bought it.  It's at the 50,000 mile mark, and other than routine maintenance, the only thing I've had to replace were the front brakes.  The paint job is absolutely indestructible.  There are no scratches or dings, and whatever minor scrapes that occur can be rubbed out easily with a little soft soap and a Dobie.  This is a quality machine from stem to stern:  still a smooth, powerful driving machine in pristine condition! </b>

Since 1992, when Lexus came out with their sleek SC300 and 400 models, I had been captivated by their beauty, and my husband intrigued by the combination of luxury and power in a sports car.  We'd previously owned premiere model "true" sports cars, a '69 Datsun 240Z and a '79 Mazda RX7, both fun cars to drive, but uncomfortable to travel any distance in.  The Lexus seemed to be a car both of us could be happy with, but there was a drawback: the steep price tag.  So we waited, and finally compromised: we purchased a previously owned '95 SC400, in November of '97, with 17,000 miles, from a local dealer, in mint condition.  It was the best "car decision" we've ever made.

I've become the primary driver of this pearl white SC, and I love it.  We live in a hilly area of Southern California, and the SC's superb handling and road-hugging ability, along with its power, are features I really appreciate.  It's a joy on the freeway as well, with quick acceleration and excellent handling to get around those big rigs.  My husband's only complaint is that the brakes seem "soft" to him, and he prefers more of a sports car "feel" when he drives.  We both appreciate the amenities, though: luxurious leather seating, tilt-steering wheel, 12-CD player, and most importantly of all, its reliability!  In the two-plus years we've had the SC400, we've never had to replace brakes, or have the car in for anything more than routine servicing.  This is a car we haven't grown tired of, and will enjoy driving for many years to come.
