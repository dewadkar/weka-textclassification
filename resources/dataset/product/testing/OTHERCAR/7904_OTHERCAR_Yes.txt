            This is a great camera.  It's easy to use and comes with a great manual and technical support.  I called the good folks at Canon for what later turned out to be a misunderstanding on my part, and they were readily available and surprisingly helpful.

The A20 is designed to be easy to use since it automatically determines shutter speed and exposure.  The A20 also uses a 3 pt. auto-focus system that helps reduce fuzzy faces from photos, a problem I had often experienced with my previous digital camera.

The camera is versatile; you are never short on power since it's able to utilize the AA size alkaline batteries that are available worldwide.  The Power Shot can also capture up to 500 images using alkaline batteries or up to 1000 images with NiMH batteries.  I, like others, found that the AA batteries died out very quickly.  This is a negative thing, but the added convenience of a dual power source makes up for it.  If you don't have to, you can avoid using AA's until an emergency crops up.

Another great thing in this camera is the flash.  It is excellent, and I read that it provides the highest light output in its class. It's believable.

Despite an affordable price tag, the camera provides several features normally associated with more expensive models, such as shutter speeds from 1 second to 1/1500 of a second; high precision white balance; and nine image quality modes that help users to choose the perfect level of definition.

You can store up to 87 images in this camera with the supplied 8MB mem card and then use the USB interface to connect the camera to your Macintosh or PC computer and upload them.  The software that was bundled with my A20 included ZoomBrowser EX 2.6 (ImageBrowser 1.6 for Mac users) and PhotoStitch 3.1.

This is quite simply a great camera.  I work at a Circuit City, so I know what the competition holds.  For the price and the features, you can't go wrong.
