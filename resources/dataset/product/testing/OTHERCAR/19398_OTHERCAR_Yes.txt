            With rising gas prices, Honda has a real winner in the CR-V.  It gets great gas mileage (approx. 30 MPG average) even with the automatic transmission.  It is a joy to drive: handles just like a Honda car, the ride is not TOO harsh, and can be parked in tiny parking spaces.  Everything on the dashboard is within easy reach of the driver, ample cupholders for everyone, the parking brake is down low and out of the way. The spare tire is mounted low on the tailgate so it doesn't hamper your view when backing up.  In the spot where the spare tire normally fits, there is a storage spot - Honda says you can store your soft drinks there, but it actually can be used for anything.

 It is easy for a short person like myself (5'3&quot; tall) to get in/out of - you don't need to carry along a ladder as with most SUV's.  I believe this vehicle would fit into most lifestyles - from &quot;soccer moms&quot; in lieu of a minivan to anyone else just wanting a &quot;fun&quot; vehicle to drive.  Who shouldn't buy this vehicle:  The ride can be a little harsh on trips over 100 miles, so maybe a salesman who travels quite a bit should opt for something else. <br><br>
