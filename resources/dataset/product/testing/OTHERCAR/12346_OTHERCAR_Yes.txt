            Dear Reader. 


 My aunt that lives in Bristol, Conneticut owns a 95 Mitsubishi Diamante. I have been driving the car for a couple of weeks since I came here to visit them. I must admit, I felt in love with the car. I mean the interior is so spacious, the trunk is huge, the seats are incredibly comfortable, and the comfort features are everywhere. I specially like the Automatic Transmission modes, "Economy" or "Power". The Air conditioner is extremly cold, and the lumber support is very good for long trips. I specially like the infinity stereo, with a very good sound quality. This car is equiped with the 3.0L V6 engine, and I must say is quite powerful. It provides good acceleration and passing power. The brakes are four disc with ABS. They provide more than enough stopping power. This car is a very for families. I have been driving it around with my cousins and their families, and the car has been very comfortable in many circumstances. The fuel economy is great, the style is nice, it resembles many european luxury sedans. The only problem with this car is the expensive price for repairs. But other than that is a very good economical car. I hope you may find this review very helpful. For further information about this car you may contact me at texasaltima@yahoo.com I would be please to answer any questions you may have regarding this car. I will continue to enjoy driving this car for two more weeks, so look for a more update it review of this car in a near future.
