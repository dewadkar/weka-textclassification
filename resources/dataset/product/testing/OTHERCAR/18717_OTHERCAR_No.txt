            In 1999, I was looking for a large sedan with which I could take long trips.  After much consideration, I decided on a Buick Park Avenue.  After checking the prices of new ones ($31,500.00)I decided on a late model used one.  The car that I chose was a 1995 Buick Park Avenue.  The car registered 27,828 miles on the odometer and was in beautiful condition.  It came with power windows,locks, am/fm cassette stereo, leather seats, automatic rear leveling shocks, climate control, automatic lights, keyless entry, GM's 3800 series II V-6 and an assortment of other amenities.
The first thing that I noticed about this car was that it felt solid and sturdy.  When taken on the highway, it is very smooth and quiet.  The "dynaride" system allows the suspension to soak up most pot holes without jarring the interior and disturbing the ride.   It is as if you are sitting on your living room sofa while speeding down the highway.  The gas mileage on the highway ranges between 21 and 23 miles per gallon, which is quite thrifty for a car of this size.  I also am able to use regular 87 octane unleaded which is a money saver.  The climate control system does a commendable job of keeping you cool or warm at any time of the year.  It's controls and displays are very well positioned and easy to operate.  Visibility is good due to the high roofline.  
In the city, the gas mileage is between 18 and 19 miles per gallon.  City driving is where this car looses some of it's appeal.  It bounds and heaves over rough roads, giving one the sensation of being on a boat during rough seas.  It leans severely in hard turns, struggling to get out of it's own way.  There is very little feeling of the road in the steering which gives the driver the sense that he/she is really not in control of this vehicle.  Finding a comfortable driving position can be a chore with the electric seats offering a limited amount of positions.  This is not so bad on a long trip, as with cruise control, you can lean further back, however, in the city, you need to be able to be at the steering wheel and peddles much more.  I have found that the pick up in this car is not up to par with others that I have since driven in this class.  It moans and struggles to get up to highway speeds when entering the freeway causing you to have to floor it, thus engaging it's loud and jolting passing gear.  
Now for the reliability.  After owning this car for six months, I had to replace the A/C compressor($1200.00).  The electric seat on the passengers side was inoperable within the first year($128.00).  The windshield wiper motor went out after a year and one month($112.35).  Two months later, the transmission required repair($630.00).  The car is now burning oil, however, they can't figure out why.  A car with 46,000 miles should not burn oil. It also suffers from a variety of rattles and squeaks, one of which is most annoying!  Somewhere in the rear door panel, something is rubbing against something else, emitting a high pitched bird like chirp.  Nobody, not even the dealer can figure that one out.  
Well, in conclusion, it has it's goods points and it's bad points, however, the bad points coupled with it's poor reliability prevent me from recommending it.   

Update:  2/25/02  After several years of trying to have the above mentioned problems repaired, I gave up and traded it for a new Lexus.  Hopefully this one will be reliable.
