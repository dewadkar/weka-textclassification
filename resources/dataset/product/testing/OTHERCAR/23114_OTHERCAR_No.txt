            I'm sorry but this car has been inexcusable since the very first week. We bought the car at night, my mistake since at first light I was able to see how poor the paint job was. When I returned it to the dealer and showed them they were reluctant to do anything about it. After pushing hard they sent us to their body shop. It was contracted out (the dealer didn't do it) and the body shop was great and they also said that this was not uncommon with these cars. The whole front end was repainted but the whole thing could have been done.

Then we noticed that the seat buckles in the back seat could not be buckled as both ends had the same buckle. We had to wait for ordered parts and return again to have them replaced.

Then the front drivers door leaked when it rained. Back to body shop to have it realigned.

The brakes have squeaked since the day we got it. The dealer says this is normal. They (fronts) were replaced at 30000 miles, which is not bad, and the new set also squeak.

The car has had two recalls. One on the shifter cable, can break if not adjusted right. Also rear brake line can get against exhaust.
Both were corrected but two more trips to the dealer.

Now for the good stuff. At just over 20000 miles one of the auto transmission lines to the oil cooler in front of car started to leak. It leaked all over the painted plastic in the nose which I'm sure is not good for it. Then at 34000 miles the head gasket started leaking coolant all over. Not only should this not have occurred but then they didn't have the part and had to order it. A total of three more trips to the dealer.

During this time the steering started a whining noise when turned for a hard turn. While in for the engine work we asked to have it checked. They said had to top off fluid and that they didn't hear the noise. It was in for preventive maintenance 1 1/2 mos before and just over 1400 miles. They said no leaks so where did fluid go? Leaving their parking lot it made the noise again.

The 4 cylinder engine is noisy and the transmission makes a weird clicking noise when you put it in reverse. It has done this since new.

Now I have to say that the style is very nice. The car has good room inside and I think is pretty comfortable for a car of this size and price.
The engine even though a 4 cylinder has good acceleration and is quite capable of entering highway traffic. Mileage is fairly good with a highway of near 30 mpg.

The financing is what sold us on the car since it is hard to beat 1 percent for 5 years.

But after 2 1/2 years I will be getting rid of the car and will never own another Dodge/Chrysler product ever again. I cannot recommend this car to anyone.<br><br>
