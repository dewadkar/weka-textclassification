            I have been a long time Honda driver. From Civic to my most recient (2000)CR-V, I have always been a big fan of the efficent engine design, general performance and comfortable cockpits that Honda delivers. So when I decided to find something a little roomier and more powerful, I was immediately attracted to the new Pilot (I will be discussing the EX).

I did a lot of test driving before I decided on the Pilot. After having been in a Honda for over 10 years, I thought I should at least see what the competition was doing. I wound up test driving the Murano, Highlander, 4-Runner, and the new Explorer (as well as other things, but this will suffice for the purpose of this review.) Ultimately I came running back to the Pilot.

<b>Performance</b>: Compared to the CR-V, the Pilot was a dream to drive. It is significantly quieter (road thrum in moderate at worst, engine noise is really kept outside of the cockpit and air noise is almost non-exsistant) and more powerful (6V 240-hp). One of the things that I like about the Pilot is that because it is on Oddesy frame it handles much more like a "car" than, say the 4-Runner or Explorer  which had the very stiff handling of ...well... a truck. For a truck of this size, the turning radius is better than expected and the vehicle does not have too terrible a lean in cornering, especially for is higher center of gravity.

I will say that I thought that the steering control was a little mushier than the CR-V or the Highlander, but the overall ride of the truck is very smooth. Uneven pavement is no problem for Honda's trademark tight suspension. 

Pilot has Honda's VTM-4 ECU all wheel drive. This is a wonderful feature. The CR-V has a similar system and it is excellent for slick roads and  snow. Pilot is generally front-wheel drive, but if the front wheels slip, up to 55% of the engin power is routed to the back wheels for added tracktion. You can also lock in the 50/50 split with the click of a buttin for getting out of really tricky situations.

Fuel consumption is about what I would expect from a Honda truck with a VTEC engine in it (17 traffic/22 highway). Not phenominal, but there is far worse.

<b>Styling/Function</b>: Another attribute that has always been indearing about Honda (in my opinion) is their sense of style. Classic, sophisticated lines and styling that doesn't date quickly. The Pilot is no exception. Somewhere between the CR-V and a Jeep, the look of the Pilot is in keeping with all of Honda's designs. Compared to the Murano or even the 4-Runner, the style is a little plain, but it is not unattractive or boring.

The interior of the Pilot is also a testiment to Honda's sense of ergonomics. All of the controls are easy to access. The dash board is unobstructed by the steering wheel (though I think the CR-V did an even better job of this). I will say that the stereo in the Pilot is a bit more complex to use than some of the previous designs, and will take a bit more to be able to operate it without taking eyes off of the road. The upside is that Honda has included "mode", "volume" and "channel" control on the steering wheel in the EX model, so after an initial set-up, you may not have to look at the stereo too often. I also really enjoy the esthetics of the overall dash displays. It is a very cool and sphisticated design.

I also noticed that the shift rod can get hung-up when moving from PARK or DRIVE. A minor thing, but a seemingly obvious engineering flaw you would think whould have been addressed.

Other perks that come standard are rear wiper, powered mirrors, front and rear climate control, cruise, power windows and doors, AM/FM/CD stereo (cassette and 7-speaker system with the EX) and enough stroage areas and cup holders for the whole family. Overall, the standard amenities that come with the Pilot are more that suffient for the average driver. Technophiles (or salespeople) may want to spend the extra $2000 for the Honda on-board navigation system, or, if you have kids, you might want to spring for the DVD entertainment system.

The only "flaw" I found in the Pilot is the rather uninspired design of the interior. Although I will say that none of the SUV class vehicles really impressed me in their interior design. Generally, they range from "average" to "down right ugly". Overall, the interior of the Pilot is VERY room compared to it's competition and certainly more than the CR-V. The seating is very comfortable, with ample support in all of the right places (EX models include drivers seat lombar support and 8-way power adjustments). The 3rd row seats aren't very comfortable, and could have been better designed, but the second row seats are also very comfortable and roomy.

Overall the Pilot is a very comfortable SUV and would be a pleasure to take on long road trips ( I have yet to do so), as well as tooling around the city.

<b>Size</b>: Ok, this was a big thing for me. Finding something that was bigger than the CR-V, but not as bohemuth as an Expedition or Escalade was important. I didn't want something that would be impossibl to parallel park or even get into a mall parking lot. Both the Highlander and the Pilot are big enough to do any kind of "light hauling" you might need to do (pilot has approx/ 90 cu-ft. with all of the back seats folded down), but small enough that they are negotable in real-life parking situations. 

Again, the fact that the Pilot "feels" like a car makes things like parking and pulling out easier. You dont get too many surprises, though it is taking some time to get used to Pilot's length as compared to the CR-V (for those of you who don't trust your depth perception, you can get a back-up indicator for an additional $500.)

Overall, the Pilot is bigger, but quite manageable in the real world.



<b> Overall</b>: Honda took their time in entering the SUV world (the Passport doesn't count) and they did it right. The Pilot has all of the trademark benefits of a Honda and then some. Aside from some engineering flaws and soft steering, the Pilot handles very nicely and is a step above much of it's competition when it comes to comfort, power, style and manuverability.

Don't buy a Pilot if your looking for a rugged, off-roading SUV (some of the American made trucks would be better suited), but if your looking for a slightly luxurious way to get the family around town, of if you just like to get out on the road and cruise, the Pilot is the right choice.

A note about the warenty. Honda offers their standard 3-year/30,000 on this vehicle, which tends to be a little stingy. you may want to consider getting an extended warrenty on this vehicle if your buying.
