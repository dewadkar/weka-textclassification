                 We were your typical American family of four floored by &quot;sticker shock&quot; when we went shopping for our first new car in 1998.  The Chevy Cavalier was our salvation.  We were able to finance this car with very little down payment and still end up with payments that wouldn't force us to live in the car!  Our Cavalier's two year anniversary is coming up in a couple of months and I can sincerely say we have not had one single problem with this vehicle.  We are still getting +/- 23 miles per gallon.  As our kids grow into teenagers, we do miss some of the leg room that other cars might offer, but we all feel it's a small price to pay for the value of our sporty little Cavalier.  <br><br>
