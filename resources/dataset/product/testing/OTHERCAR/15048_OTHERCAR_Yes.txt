            I owned a Sony MCV-FD91 and found that the 91 is more camera than I needed.  I compared the prices and the features and decided to sell the MCV-91 to my boss and to purchase the FD-73 for myself.  This is a great little camera.  It lets you take a clear, sharp picture and with the disk, you can download easily into your computer and use it for auctions or to send photographs by email.  My suggestion is... if you take a lot of pictures, then purchase a second battery and also the carrying case that is made for this camera.  You have a zippered pocket for your disks and ample room for your camera.  If you want the movie feature as well as a still picture, then this is not the camera for you, but if you think that you would only use the still pictures, then this little camera can't be beat when it comes to price, ease of instructions and accessories.<br><br>
