            The new Oldsmobile Alero is a very good car.  This car handles excellent in no matter what the conditions are.  I have rented this car a great number of times too many to actually say at this point but each time I drive this vehicle.  

This car gets great gas mileage as well as great pick up.  The car doesn't hesitate nor do you have to give pressure to the gas in order for this car to have pick up at all.  The Alero has room for five adults it has more room in the back then most mid-size cars in its class.  Some of the nice added features in the Alero are; (1) it lets you know when the tire pressure is low in your tires; (2) you have the option of both cd &amp; cassette in this car; (3) it has a large roomy trunk so for the person who loves to shop there would no problem with truck space; (4) the cruise controls are on the steering wheel so for the person who has a difficult time setting the cruise or even locating it will have no problems at all; (5) it is very stylish as well as sporty so for the person who likes to have the best of both worlds the Alero offers this for you; (6) and if you love the luxury of keyless remote it also come with keyless remote.

The bad points that it has which is not many is; (1) the tire pressure sensor has a tendency to come on and not go off; (2) not a large amount of colors to choose from. <br><br>
