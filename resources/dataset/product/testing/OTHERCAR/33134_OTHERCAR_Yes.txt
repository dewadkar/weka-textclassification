            I dont know about these new Chevy Malibus that look all pretty.  I have a 1982 Chevy Malibu Classic and it is rugged.  I feel like I own the road when I drive.  I named him Jerome because I feel like a big black man when I cruise down the road.  There is no name for the color of this car.  Its somewhere between brown, tan, and gold with a pinkish hue.  IT IS UGLY AS SIN.  But appearance is not what this car is all about.  Its about comfort.  Its about style.  Its about personality.  Lemme tell you about personality.  Personality is the fact that i have to shut the car off in reverse or it coughs for a few minutes.  Personality is the way the gas gauge doesnt work at all, or any other gauges for that matter.  Personality is the windows that dont roll down in the back seat.  Personality is the old fashioned, non-digital clock on the dashboard.  So what if it eats gas more than a truck would.  So what if people laugh at you for driving in it.  So what if when you start the car it puts out more exhaust than a power plant.  Just take one ride in it and he will win you over.  So i advise you to go buy an old chevy malibu......as ugly as you can find.  Give it the name of a big man black guy.  Then just drive around and enjoy.<br><br>
