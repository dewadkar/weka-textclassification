            Hi, I'm Peter and I love cars. I am about to buy a 1997 Range Rover 4.6L. I've thoroughly researched this car and decided that there is no other car that I would want. There are two major problems with this car however. The acceleration is close to 10 seconds for 0-60 mph. This is very discouraging but I decided that I will send it to a customizer and get an Eaton M-90 supercharged engine. This increases the hp to 335 and will drop the time down to close to 7 seconds. This upgrade will cost close to $15,000 but the depreciation will pay for it. The depreciation is the second problem. Unless you plan on keeping the car forever or buying the car used, as I am, you will stand to lose a lot of money in your investment. After 2 years this particular Range Rover will lose close to %50 of its value. Also, this car is VERY heavy. It ways close to twice as much as other SUVs which will make the steering and acceleration feel sluggish despite its huge V8 engine. The best thing about this car is its luxurious feel. It combines the luxury of a BMW and the feeling of driving a Benz. Also, if you plan on going offroad, this is it, there is no better car except maybe the Hummer or the Galaendenwagon made by Mercedes. The Hummer, though is very tight and you just pay for the 4x4 system. The Benz will cost you over $100,000. Let me remind you that this is also the vehicle that the queen of England drives.<br><br>
