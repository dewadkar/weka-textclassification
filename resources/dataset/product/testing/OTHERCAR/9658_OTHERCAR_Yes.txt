            I bought my neon Aug. 1997.  It came with 14,900 miles on it and it has 54,000 miles on it now.  Through 4 yrs with this car I've had one dead battery, two headgasket leaks, a door panel that cracked and started falling off, and an exhaust problem(dont know what it was exactly, the warranty covered it)  My car had no problems 1997, and 1998, the battery slowly started dying about a yr and a half ago(late 99) Headgasket leaks around the same time.  The problem with the exhaust and the door panel came in 2000.  So my car is averaging about 2 trips a yr to the shop.  This was/is my first car.  I bought it the day I got my license(18yrs old)  It's a 4 door automatic sohc engine.(133hp)  (you can also get this car with a dohc 150 hp engine!)  The best thing I can say about this car is it's never left me stranded.  Anytime there's been a problem, i.e. the battery, exhaust, leak, it's happened slowly and i've had time to find out what it is and fix it.  The neon has it's downsides, but overall the good outweighs the bad.  I love this car.  I've been tempted to get a new car on more than a few occasions but I like it too much to get rid of it. About two yrs ago I had the choice between a '94 ford mustang or this neon(my parents were going to sell it and gave me the option of keeping their mustang and selling my neon)  But I kept my neon.  I got a lot of crap for this from friends, but that's how much i like this car.  It really grows on you.  It's comfortable, It has a good stereo system.  The stock tape player sucks, but I replaced that with a cd player so that problem has been taken care of.  Any road noise there might be is easily drowned out by the stereo.  It has lots of room(leg and head), good visibility, a tilt steering wheel to give you more than enough room, comfortable seats(at least for me and i'm 6'0 200 lbs)  It has air conditioning(at least mine came with that option)  I like how it handles.  You can take some pretty swervy turns and still keep a solid 75 mph.  Most of the gripes i've heard about this car aren't real big problems.  As a matter of fact, they're things I never even noticed until I read them.  However, if you're used to driving grandpa-mobiles than you might be dissapointed.
