            At the time in 1994 this vehicle was an excellent bargain for the whole thing. Today if I had a choice i would purchase this car again. It is just that type of car that you get to attached to because of all it has to offer. Most of the Legends came FULLY loaded with options and ran for the price of around 29000 dollars. The Legends with less features was still an excellent bargain at about 24000 dollars. Ours was in between standard and fully loaded. It came standard with a BOSE STEREO !!! A great automatic sunroof, finger controls of the stereo at the  steering wheel, and beautiful leather seats. The engine was immaculate. This was definitely a sports car at heart yet an actual luxurious family car  at the same time. It was truly a privilege to own a Legend. I would get continuous compliments on how gorgeous the car was. It is extremely well handling on sharp turns and has great pickup. If your a person with a family who wants some style, power, and luxury all in one package, this is the one for you.<br><br>
