            In 1991 we needed a new vehicle and we wanted a mini van so,checked out all the mini vans that were on the market that year and we decided on the Dodge Plymouth Grand Caravan. 
We decided on the grand caravan because of the extended wheel base the extended wheel base is longer than the regular mini van with this feature you get more room in the very back of the van.
This van has a lot of good features like the rear defroster and a rear wiper blade which is great to keep the rear window clear for better vision. The back bench seat can be removed for extra room or just folded down. The electronic start makes is easy to start at first I would forget and push on the gas when I started it up. 
It is so roomy for everything we need. I can put all my groceries in the back of the van and still have room for other things. My hubby can haul his golf bag and bowling bag with no problem. I really like the automatic door locks my mini van has when you get up to 15 miles per hour all the doors automatically lock,this makes it safer with children. It is great for kids a lot of room for them. I am always hauling around other kids besides my own.
The only real major problem we have had with our Dodge Plymouth grand caravan is 2 years ago the rocker arm broke and cracked the head and we replaced those parts. But looking at the year and mileage we have on our van I don't think that was too bad. If I ever buy another mini van I will for sure purchase another Dodge Plymouth grand caravan.
