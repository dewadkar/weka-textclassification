            We bought ours with 48k on it. I proceded to put new tires on it and had the dealer do the brakes. We traded it at 102k. In that time it went through 3 SETS of brakes, those rear discs never were right. The day we were driving to the dealer to get our new car the master cylinder went out so you had to &quot;stab&quot; the brakes quickly so they would work. My brother has a 1993 Buick Regal (&quot;same&quot; car) and has had the same problem with it eating rear brakes.
The reason we were trading, right at 100k the tranny started slipping, usually when you had to really move to merge. We also had trouble with a door handle and the digital dash.
The car handled great, plenty of power and the visibility was good. Comfortable for the trips we made to Chicago occasionally (250 miles)
