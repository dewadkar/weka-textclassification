I bought this car because I could get it for MSRP.  Shop around and you can get it for this price too!  I wanted something fun, and sporty that didn't set me back 40K.  I also wanted something that I could upgrade as necessary to suit my tastes, the Spyder simply has it all.  The best way I can describe driving the car is a Go-Kart on steroids!  You point this baby a direction and it simply goes there!  Incredible handling, great ride, and enough HP to get you where you need to go, remember this car is VERY light, you don't need 200 HP.  I've owned and driven all the rest, M Roadster, Boxster, S2000, and this car is the most raw fun of any of them. Sure some of the others may have nicer features such as heated leather seats, or automatic tops, but this car is simply a joy to drive!  People looking for a fun car who live somewhere that they can put the top down often (rules out Seattle) would really enjoy this car.  People with large families who want to haul a lot of junk around should get an SUV instead.  Don't give in to the dealer markups, shop around, there are dealers out there selling for MSRP.  Check my website for more information on the car and how you can protect your investment!<br><br>
