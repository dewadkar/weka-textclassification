            I researched a vehicle to fit my lifestyle for quite some time.  With the amount of time I spend in the mountains, most of the small SUV's out there are not up to snuff.  What distinguished the Xterra from the Honda CR-V, the Toyota RAV4, Jeep Liberty the Ford Escape and others like them, was the fact that it was built on a truck frame rather than a unibody like a car.  It also has the most ground clearance of any in it's class.  

When it came time for me to trade in earlier this year, it was a no brainer.  Since my purchase, I have taken this vehicle on trails rated "most difficult" and recommended for modified vehicles only.  With a limited slip differential, bigger off road tires, skid plates and 4WD low (all standard on the SE model), it has surmounted every challenge put before it....  nothing short of superb.  It's super-tight turning radius makes it the most maneuverable in its class.  

As for on road performance, this is no Mercedes.  It has a relatively narrow track and slightly more noise than a more road-oriented vehicles such as the CR-V or the Highlander.  but still more creature comforts than I expected.  The 300 watt Rockford Fosgate sound system has excellent sound quality and power to spare.  If someone is looking for towing capacity like a full sized truck, they should go buy one.  5500 pounds is plenty for hauling a 19 foot boat, but not enough for a loaded farm trailer.  Gas mileage is 16/20, about what I expected.  The Xterra has heavy-duty construction that adds weight to the vehicle.  As a result, acceleration is not as spirited as some lighter-duty vehicles.  The Xterra is what it is.  It is not a luxury car, a minivan or a full-sized truck.   It is the only SUV in it's class designed for off-road use.
