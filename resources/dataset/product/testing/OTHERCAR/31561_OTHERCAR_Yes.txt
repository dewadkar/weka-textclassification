            I love my 1986 240. There is nothing it can't do or places it can't go. Actually, that's a lie. It can't go in the woods, and it can't really hit a hundred miles an hour either, unless the woods are paved, or the highway slopes down for several thousands yards. Nevertheless, there is no need to drive in the woods or at over a hundred miles an hour, therefore my trusty 240 will be just fine. 

I drive this thing everywhere. I am about to take it on a three thousand mile journey from Boston to San Francisco, then two months later, back. I am not worried in the least little bit. I bought this car after it was garaged for 4 years and had 60,000 miles on it in 1994 or 1995, I don't remember. Since then, there have been no major problems save for a strangely leaky tire.

I've never been in an accident in it, but, although I do consciously avoid accidents, I am would not be worried about my wel-being if I ever do. When you climb into a Volvo, you feel safe, and that is certainly the case with this one. The newer, sleeker models try to timidly hide the fact that there is a steel cage underneath, whereas the 240 comes right out and admits &quot;I am a steel cage!! And I love being a steel cage, thank you kindly!&quot; 

It has served me well, and, better, will continue to do the same thing for the remainder of my life, or its life, whichever comes first. Really, all you have to do is change the oil and the Volvo keeps moving. Acceleration is slow, but not tortoise-ish. Trunk space is cavernous, leg room, too. Really, I love Volvos too much to ever say anything bad about them, but the 240 is a dream for a person like me, who doesn't really want to have to worry about a car not starting (not onceï¿½well, the dome light incident is something I don't often mention, so we'll leave it at that), or breaking down, or having any other sort of automotive malady. 

Driving this car is like handling a classic. There has been at least one 240 in my family since 1981, and the driveway would look empty without one. But there is a reason for that. They are reliable, safe, and fun to drive. Just as long as you define fun as being able to look at another driver and say &quot;My car will eat yours, buddy.&quot;<br><br>
