            I am 17Yrs Old and this is my first car. After test-driving tons of other cars (including a 1996 Mazda 626) I fell in love with this car right away. After 1year and a half with this car, Its still a BLAST to drive. It truly is a luxury car. 

   This is a FWD Car with a 3.8L V6 engine (3800 Series 1) which makes handling in the snow AWESOME. I am a New Englander and we had a pretty bad winter and this car held strong. It out handles my Mom's 2002 Ford Taurus (which in the snow is all over the road).
   In dry weather this car also handles and rides like a dream. Not quite as nice as my boss's BMW 530i but it handles better than most cars. I compare it to my grandfather's 2000 Lincoln Town Car. 

   The interior of the car is kind of old but its still kinda fun (the console makes you think you are piloting a commercial airliner :)). It's still nice however with wood grain door panels and a wood grain dash. The Environmental controls include a passenger and driver side Temperature settings, and they REALLY DO work. 
    It has powered everything (driver seat, windows, steering, mirrors, etc). You can also open your trunk from the interior of the car (only while the car is in park or neutral too) by the press of a button in your glove compartment.
    My model (the Limited) also came with an all leather interior which is AWESOME because buick cloth seats are WAY to soft.
    My favorite interior feature (which I brag as "a LUXURY item" HeHe) is the Visor Extension. When you pull your visor down and it doesn't quite reach the sun it has a black plastic slider that you slide out to reach it :). The only downside is you have to either tuck it behind or in front of your rear view mirror.
    ANOTHER REALLY AWESOME feature is the radio controls on the steering wheel (that power the 6-Speaker system). The cruise control features are on the "blinker" level.
