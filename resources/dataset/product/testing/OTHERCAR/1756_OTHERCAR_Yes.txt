            God Bless Mazda for offering a 5 speed with a V6 engine.  Someone there still believes cars are supposed to be fun.

We bought a 1995 ES V6 because it comes loaded with leather, power moonroof, 4 wheel disc brakes, ABS, 15&quot; alloys, V rated tires, and of course the V6/5 speed combination, which is rare.  Honda doesn't offer one, and Toyota's was poorly packaged.  Both were several thousand more after incentives factored in.

I love the engine, the slick shifter (these guys make the Miata), and the packaging of options (it has everything).  Makes me feel like I'm driving a much more expensive car.

Dislikes include my wife's speeding tickets.  It's also required only one out-of-warranty service so far, but that's not bad.  It's only offered in sedan form, which limits its utility (I believe they do make hatch versions for other markets).

It's not for families with more than two kids, or for people that need to haul a lot of stuff.  We call ours &quot;Emmy&quot;, but you could call it the &quot;executive express&quot;.  It's good for driving clients or tourist friends around in comfort (they'll think you're much wealthier than you are), but still allows the driver to have a secret dark side which can have fun with the stick.
