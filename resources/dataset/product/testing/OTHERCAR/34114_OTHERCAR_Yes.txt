            This is a Mini Van I am Proud to own.  I love the look of this van&#133everyone refers to it as a shuttle craft.
The body panels are plastic/fiberglass combination that does not dent.  Coining the phrase All Plastic Vehicle as the reason for the APV.   <p>
The windshield will give a slight distortion effect for the first few times you  drive this vehicle but you quickly adapt to it and realize it allows you to see in areas that other mini vans fall short of.<p>

The 3.1 engine is superb!  Powerful enough for what you need a mini van to do.  Mine has 112 thousand miles on it and there have been no serious problems with it all along.
<p>
Inside the seats are very mobile, you can put them all in and carry 7 passengers, cargo and a dog.  Take them out and you can haul 4 X 8 sheets of plywood  and anything else you would want.  The interior has held up very well, the velour seats and carpet are very stain resistant.   
<p>
The only things I would consider to be problematic about it is the fact that the brake system and the Air conditioning are the same units installed on the Lumina cars, therefore making them undersized for this vehicle.  Brake pads have to be replaced at least every 6 to 8 thousand miles and the air conditioning struggles on really hot days.
 <p>
This van may not have the bells and whistles that newer vans have, such as power windows and seats but all in all this would be an excellent choice for any family.  Perhaps a step up until a newer vehicle could be purchased.  However,  I plan to be keeping mine until it&#146s no longer serviceable.
