            My wife and I were looking for a new car since our Eagle Talon was now paid off and nearing 100,000 miles.  We wanted something that we could camp in, commute in, shop in.  Quite by chance, we found ourselves in a Mitsubishi dealership, this was after a very nasty car purchase experience at a neighboring Ford dealership but that's another story.  

We took one look at the Montero Sport and fell in love.  The XLS 2WD in White with leather seats.  It's like getting in for the first time every time I go to work.  I love this car!!  The interior is a very classy combination of three shades of brown.  There is plenty of room for all, the ride is incredibly quiet and smooth.  With the Infinity stereo you can really crank the heavy metal at the end of those bad days or some light rock for the better ones.  The electronic dimming mirror is a nice touch as well.  All controls are easy to operate and are within arms reach.  You can also raise or lower the driver seat with a easy to operate lever.  And a super size coke from McDonald's fits in the cup holder!  What more do you want??

As luck would have it I was also able to try the hydraulic jack and spare tire securing mechanisms.  The spare uses a raising and lowering mechanism you can operate from inside the rear of the truck.  Very handy!  They also give you a real car jack, a nice hydraulic.  You can lift the truck off the ground with one finger.  As changing tires go, a very enjoyable experience.  

The most appealing thing is that not everybody and their brother has one!  Although I can't for the life of me figure out why.  This is by far the best automobile purchase I have made yet.<br><br>
