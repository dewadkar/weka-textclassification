            Styling:
No question; the most distinctive looking pickup on the market today, there's no mistaking this rig for anything other than a RAM!

Driving:
I continue to be impressed with the civility of this truck's manners. I often have to remind myself this is a 2 and a 1/2 ton truck and not a sports car. Handling is excellent with very little body lean, and the truck always tracks straight even in gusty highway conditions. There is a slight rear-end jiggle when the bed is unloaded, over rough roads, but this is not of major concern and is very easy to get acustommed to. The power of the 287 (4.7L) V-8 is more than adequate. You never find yourself wanting for power in passing or merging manuvers. Excellent low-end torque makes for strong off the line response, and thanks to its OHC design the engine has a wider power band than the pushrod GM motors. The tranny is smooth as silk, and quickly reacts to driver input. One small annoyance it the tranny's overeagerness to kick out of overdrive on steep hills, the engine has more than enough power to pull up such grades, but the trans. always gives it that little extra help. The brake response is incredible. Sports car level. Even without front anti-lock the truck stops on a dime. Pedal pressure is not excessive, and there's never any pedal fight. Ride is again, top of the class. No float like the GM trucks, firm, but smooth and solid,never harsh.

Comfort:
Front seats have excellent support, many long trips were made with very little fatigue. Room inside cab is cavernous, with excellent behind the seat storage space. Wind noise is well muffled as is road and engine noise. The most notable sound is the exhaust and it is a glorious tone. Mopar V-8 through and through. Entry/exit requires a step up, though not impossible a set of step bars would help. All controls fall easily to hand and impart a sense of quality and solidity. Manual transfer case is a nice touch, and easy to use. The bed is easy to load, however it is high. The rear end sits higher than the front, so a bit of a jump is required to get into/out of the bed.

Quality/Reliability:
1 year and 9000 miles of almost totally trouble free operation. The only required service was the replacement of a bent drive-shaft from the factory.(I attribute this to quality control more than the fault of the truck). Shaft was replaced under warranty with no hassles from the dealer. The interior is impressivly built. Solid but attractive and pleasing materials throughout. Exterior fit/finish is equally impressive, with stunning bright red (Chrysler "Flame Red") paint and good panel alignment. In my experience all full size american trucks are solidly buit and this may be the best one out there.

Ownership:
Fuel economy=dismal. But if you are going to buy a full size pickup this is probably of little concern since it is only marginally worse than your other choices. Dealer experience has been wonderful at both sales and service departments (Freehold Dodge Inc., Freehold,NJ). Have had no repair costs other than routine maintnence.

Conclusion: 
The full size pickup market is the most fiercly competitve segment out their. Dodge, Ford, GM, Toyota, all are solid vehicles. My advice would be to look at them all. With only 5 contenders it's not a tiring search, and they each have their  /-. But DO NOT overlook the Dodge. I truly feel it is currently the best full-size pickup on the market, and thats saying a lot considering its competition.
