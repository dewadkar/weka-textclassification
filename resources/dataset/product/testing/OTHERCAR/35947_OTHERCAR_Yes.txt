            This was my first digital camera and while I am not overwhelmed I am not disappointed either.  I purchased this camera because of it's competitive price for the quality of photos it produces.  A big advantage is its size.  I have taken that camera every where with me from skiing in the Alps, to the beach and now in Baghdad.  It is very easy to slip into a pocket or a back pack. 

I have taken almost a thousand pictures with varying results.  The camera seems to work well with naturally lit subjects and did well on the slopes.  I have had less than satisfactory results from pictures taken at night or minimum level of lighting.  The automatic exposure setting is good for most settings however the flash is a bit too intense for subjects closer than 4 ft. 

If you get this camera get at least one spare battery.  Rarely have I been able to finish a day trip without having to replace the battery.  They recharge quickly but do not last very long.  On the other hand I have yet to fill up the 8mb flash disk that came with the camera.

Like many other cameras, this one has the ability to take short video clips. Unfortunately the clips can only be viewed using JVC software which is a bit of a pain.  

I am now looking to replace this camera with a semi pro digital camera but I will continue to use this one for the less demanding family and vacation events.
