            I recently purchased a 2001 Silverado, 4X4, reg. cag, short box, V6, manual trans, and heavy duty suspension package. I absolutely love this truck! It rides so smooth, especially for a truck with heavy duty suspension. The V6 has plenty of power, and the 5 sp. trans shifts smoothly. The interior is great; everything is well laid out. It has the vinyl interior. Before I saw the truck I was a bit hesistant about the vinyl, but now I am so glad I have it. Firstly, the vinyl actually looks like leather (very nice). Secondly, it wipes up in a second. 

One of the other reasons I bought the truck was price/feature ratio. I bought my truck for only $18K and it has great standard features like 4 wheel disc brakes, ABS, tinted rear window, chrome front bumper, trailer wiring hookup pre-wired, and three power outlets inside. It's stuff that the other trucks don't offer. I also like the height of the truck. With the heavy duty suspension it sits at the perfect height. Not too tall, but tall enought to tower over pretty much everything else on the road. I sit almost at the level of a F-250 super duty. 

My truck prior to this was a 1999 Chevy S-10, and my new truck is sooo much more truck. My brother had a 1998 Ford F-150, and his Ford doesn't even compare. The Chevy is superior in every detail. A friend of mine has a full size Dodge.  It's a nice truck but not as refined as the new Chevy.  Go check them out and drive them and you will understand. 

Test drive the rest and you will buy Chevy. Chevy has definitely done the job right this time
