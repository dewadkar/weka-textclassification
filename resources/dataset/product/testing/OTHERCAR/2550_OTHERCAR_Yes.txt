            When I neared the age of 16, my parents enrolled me into a private driver's ed course.  I tried and tried, but I just couldn't pass the mandatory course exams.  Finally, six months into the lessons and past my 16th birthday, my parents went van-shopping, something more easy for me to learn on than the large, cumbersome full-size van that I tried to drive.  They came home with the 1999 Montana.  I could not believe how easy this van was to handle!  My driving improved, and I passed the exams.

This vehicle is great for families.  Being a teenager, and usually sitting in the back, I love the headphones plug in the middle, along with the volume control.  I don't have to bother my parents anymore while they are driving!  Also, there are so many little spaces, like the soda-can holders and seat pockets.  The bucket seats are also nice and comfortable, a great improvement over the &quot;bench&quot; seats of other mini-vans.

Anyone who is in search for a roomy but easily-manageable mini-van, the Montana is a good choice.<br><br>
