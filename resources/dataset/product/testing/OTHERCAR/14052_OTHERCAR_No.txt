            The 2001 Mercury Grand Marquis is the last of a dying breed:  the gigantic American sedan with rear wheel drive, V8 engine, and body-frame construction.  I grew up driving these Detroit chrome monsters, the Chevolet Caprice, Buick Lesabre, Chrysler New Yorker, and others like them.

I drove the Grand Marquis when my wife's car had to go into the shop for body repairs due to an accident.  The Grand Marquis was a loaner from Enterprise, provided by the other guy's insurance.  In a week's worth of driving to and from work and running various errands, I noted the following: 

Exterior Appearance:  Attractive silver paint with clear coat is impeccable.  All body seams and panel gaps are equal and well done.  Aluminum wheels with skinny whitewall tires complement the huge, by today's standards, body.  Attractive tail-lights and full width reflector on back and nice chrome vertical bar grille treatment in front. Two thumbs up!

Interior Appearance:  Light gray fabric interior, appears a little cheesy.  Instrument panel is a pleasing variety of gray tones with fake wood accents.  Full instrumentation, including oil pressure, temperature, and ammeter. Instrument panel is flat across the entire breadth of the interior and takes long arms to reach the radio, which is dead in the middle of the vast expanse.  Plastic interior components are hard and have sharp corners.  I was unable to find a comfortable seating position in the several days I drove the car.  The armrest dug into my calf the whole time and the flat floor provided no way to prop my foot comfortably. The front seat is a 50/50 split bench with two center armrests.  What I couldn't understand is why Ford put the stiff seatbelt fastener coming up through the seat about 10 inches from the edge.  Couldn't they put it between the two seats?  This poor design converted a seat which could have held a baby elephant to one that would hold a small chipmunk.  My rear end is not all that wide, but the seat belt buckle was digging into my cheek the whole time.  This needs to be addressed.  People with well-upholstered rear ends will not like this one bit.  Similarly, the driver's window weather-strip is of stiff plastic with a knife-edge.  It precluded me from resting my arm on the windowsill when the window was open.  Hello-o, Ford, are you listening?  Make the interior ergonomic, please!  No inside trunk release button?!  This is not the 50s any more!  There is really no excuse to make a car that looks luxurious on the outside and yet has a stripped down interior and skimps on the accessories.  Two thumbs down!

Power from the 4.6 liter V8 is good with smooth shift points. The car had no computer (hello) so I didn't determine the gas mileage other than to note that it took a quarter tank for each 48-mile trip back and forth to work.  The handling was nothing to write home about with vague road feel and an insecurity in the turns that could have proven very frightening and even deadly to a less experienced driver.  Most irritating of all, however, was the constant rocking and rolling ride while driving, even on boulevard-smooth pavement.  One thumb up, barely.

Lots of people drive the Mercury Grand Marquis and its sister the Ford Crown Victoria.  I can only imagine it is because of the price which admittedly is fairly reasonable for a car this size -- $23,000.  But by the time you get it up to a reasonable level of equipment befitting its appearance, you are fast approaching $30,000, so I consider it no bargain.   There is more to life than buying the cheapest thing you can find.  Sometimes you can be pennywise and pound-foolish.  In this case, I will pass on the Mercury Grand Marquis.
