            I originally placed my review of the 2004 Grand Prix here. I drove the car a couple months after it hit the market, yet it still took Epinions two more months to list the car. 

Now that the 2004 has been listed, I have updated my review based on a second test drive and placed it <b><a href="/content_108220944004">here</a></b>.

The same evening I tested the 2004 for a second time I also test drove the previous Grand Prix GTP. My general impressions:

I prefer the exterior styling of the older car. Its fluid organic lines are among the best to come out of GM in the 1990s. This was one of the rare GM designs that was not severely constrained by having to share body panels and structural elements with another GM model. Although based on the same platform as the Chevrolet Impala, <b><a href="/auto-review-A0C-BCE8541-38095E5A-bd1">Oldsmobile Intrigue</a></b>, and <b><a href="/auto-review-37E3-2A093EC9-3A05AAA3-prod3">Buick Regal</a></b>, the differences are larger than those between models based on GM's lower-midsize (Oldsmobile Alero, Pontiac Grand Am) and large car (Buick LeSabre, <b><a href="/content_76254449284">Oldsmobile Aurora</a></b>, Pontiac Bonneville) platforms. 

Most importantly, the Grand Prix has distinct proportions. Compared to other midsize sedans, GM and otherwise, it has a much lower roof and slimmer rear quarters, giving it a long, lean look that contrasts sharply with today's taller and taller sedans.

Reviews of the 2004 have praised it for doing without the previous car's cladding. The writers of these reviews must have failed to actually look at the old Grand Prix. As was noted when it was introduced in the 1997 model year, the previous Grand Prix unlike other Pontiacs possessed clean styling devoid of heavy ribbed cladding.

Inside, the 2003 is busily styled, with lots and lots of cheap-feeling switches scattered with no apparent logic to their arrangement. Cheap plastic surfaces abound. Over rough roads body flex and design shortcomings translate to much creaking from trim rubbing on trim. My wife's Intrigue suffers from a similar malady. The 2004 interior looks and feels much higher in quality.

The 2003 GTP, with a 240-horsepower supercharged 3.8-liter six, is fast. The very American deep engine note isn't harsh, but lacks the sophistication of the best DOHC sixes. The steering provides good feedback and feels precise on-center, but lacks the smoother, more luxurious feel of the 2004's steering. Handling is fairly good, though in a perf-oriented sedan I expected less lean in turns. Body motions in the 2003 could be better controlled over rough roads. The upside: in casual driving the ride is not bad.

The front seats are hard, flat, and insufficiently bolstered. The rear seat is low and hard, but a bit roomier and more comfortable than that in the 2004. 

Ultimately, I like the exterior styling of the old Grand Prix, but in just about every other area the 2004 is a much better car. My main reservation about picking up one of these used is the amount of creaking present in the fairly new car I test drove. My 1996 Ford Contour is far older, yet suffers from no such creaking. If you happen to find a used Grand Prix that feels and sounds solid, which I am not sure is possible, then it would not be a bad car to own.
