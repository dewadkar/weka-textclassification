            I've purchased the ES300 in North Jersey (Bergen) and have driven more than 10000 miles. Yes, the transmission did have some problems (it's not dangerous, but feels sluggish) but I knew it was a software problem; Lexus of America (the Toyota Headquarters) sent me a detailed-letter telling me that I can get this problem/glitch fixed at no cost (under drive train warranty) at the dealership, telling me that this was a computer glitch, nothing more.

Speaking of dealership, the service at Lexus (and Toyota) dealership was flawless. They gave me a service loaner for a day, in which it cost me nothing. After the tune-up, the engine felt more responsive, giving me more control in merging situations/open-road drivings.

Handling felt a little bit firm for a luxury car - although I did not get the optional AVS (adaptive variable suspension), the test drive vehicle came with the feature and I loved it. My black/black ES300 did come with a navigation system, Mark Levinson sound system, and an automatic rear shade. Navigation is easy and fun to use; I just love the POI (point of interest) feature, where I press a button and the system displays nearby ATMs, restaurants, hotels, etc. The rear shade plays provides a sanctuary, providing my family with protection from direct sunlight. Mark Levinson sound system is, in my opinion, mediocre; when listening to classical music, the bass/treble balances out very well, whereas other genres of music, it sounds like a regular 90-watt system you'd find in a regular non-luxury car.

The interior is very upscale, with California Walnut trim, Lexus's famous velvety-soft leather seats (very similar to LS430 interior I've test driven) and wooden/leather wrapped steering wheel.

I am in love with the car. I paid about $37,000 for the Lexus, full option. Don't hesitate to make a 'deal' with the dealers. The dealers are extremely courteous and won't pressure you into buying a car - I got almost $2,000 off of the invoice, so good luck.
