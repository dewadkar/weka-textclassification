            I wanted a car that looked attractive, handled easily in traffic, got good mileage, and would be a safe choice for a growing family. The 98 Saturn SL2 turned out to be a perfect choice. I bought my Saturn used in Feb. 2000. Here are some of the safety features and my experiences.

<b>Safety Features</b>

The engine is designed to drop down and slide underneath the car in the event of an accident, instead of being pushed into the front seat. 

The doors have reinforced steel beams and cross-bracing for protection in case of a collision.

It is designed with "crumple zones" in the front and back to absorb the impact in a front or rear collision.

The rear seats are designed with kids in mind. There are installed tether anchors for car seats, seatbelt adjusters so that the belt doesn't come too high across an older child's neck, and the shape of the seats helps keep kids seated properly in the seat.

<b>My Experience</b>

But you can read all that on the Saturn webpage.. Here's what I know from experience. 

I regularly get 32-36 miles per gallon for combination city and highway driving. 

I love the security system.. From time to time I can't find my car in the parking lot, so I press the panic button and when the alarm goes off, I can easily find my car. I feel very secure knowing that it is secure and that I can get people's attention easily if I need to.

When I first got the car, the rear window on the driver's side would not budge with the automatic window opener. It was still under warranty and they fixed it, and after that it has not been a problem.

There was a time when the Service Engine light came on, and when I brought it in, I was told that the gas cap had not been screwed on enough.. You have to make it click at least 3 times. While I was there, they informed me that when filling up the gas tank, you should not continue to pump gas into the tank after it has already clicked that it is full.. One of the guages is easily damaged this way and it is quite expensive to repair, and not covered under warranty.

One time when I was having my oil changed at the Saturn dealership, one of the mechanics noticed that I was missing a plastic shield that is found under the front bumper. To replace it, they wanted $120.. $80 of which was for the labor. My husband asked if he could simply buy the parts and do it himself, and they said yes, by all means. They gave him some photocopies of the installation procedure, explained it thoroughly, and a friendly mechanic even assembled the pieces so that all my husband would have to do is secure it to the car. My husband took 10 minutes in the Saturn parking lot, and voila, good as new for the cost of parts. We could not be happier with the service..

Finally, last year an ambulance drove up behind me in a rural, very muddy area, and I tried to get off the road too quickly, and slid into an embankment. The car sunk and was stuck in the mud. When I looked out the passenger window, all I could see were twigs, grass and mud. I was sure I had damaged the under-carriage and damaged the passenger side of the car. Long story short, I called a towing service, they pulled me out of the mud and hosed it off, especially the under-carriage, and it was as good as new. Not a dent, not a scratch, no damage whatsoever. 

My only complaint is with the tires that are standard on the Saturn SL2 (Firestone Affinity). They were not the recalled ones, but several times when stopping the car in the rain, my car hydroplaned on the road. With such little water on the road, it didn't seem right, and I felt that it was a matter of time before I found myself involved in a serious accident due to the tires. My husband wanted me to wait a few more months for financial reasons, but fortunately we got a flat and had to replace them! 6 months ago I replaced them with Michelin RainForce tires, and I have not had a problem since. I am thankful that I had a high-quality tire on my car through the winter, and every time we have to make a stop on a dime, I am thankful that I replaced the tires.. So if you buy a 98 Sautrn with the Affinity tires, definitely consider replacing them.

I feel comfortable, safe, and secure driving my Saturn. It has been extremely economical, especially with the high gas prices. Any problems I have had have been very minor and easily fixed. It is a pleasure to drive.
