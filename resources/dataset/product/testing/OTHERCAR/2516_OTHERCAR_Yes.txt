            The 1991 Corvette is a great sports car which is fairly economical to own, fairly reliable, and comfortable enough for everyday commuting and trips(on smooth roads).  The Corvette is the car I always dreamed of owning, so while my opinion can be a bit biased, my opinions are also measured against very high expectations.  I bought the car one year old in 1992 and it currently has 96,000 miles.  My car is a coupe with the 240hp L98 engine (last model year with this engine), 6 speed manual transmission, active selectable transmission, Bose stereo, and clear roof panel.  Overall the car has been reliable - problems include slow leak in hydraulic clutch fluid, failed fuel pump($500 dealer repair), seized U joint on rear half shaft ($800 dealer repair), a broken water pump (I repaired for about $150), and a failed battery.  Gas milage has been good, with about 20 mpg around town, and 25-30 mpg on the highway.  Insurance is no more than other cars I have owned, but I don't get collision coverage.  Of coarse the real reason for owning the car isn't because its an economy car, its truely a fun car to drive.  Acceleration, handeling, and appearance are world class for a little more cost than a top of the line mini-van.  I would not recommend the active suspension option, as I can tell little difference in the ride no matter if it is set to sport or tour settings.  The six speed is very smooth - be sure to unplug the shift-lockout solonoid to allow free shifting (Corvettes have a feature that forces shifting from 1st to 4th gear sometimes for improved gas milage - easy to disable).
Overall its a car that delivers a lot of bang for the buck, with few big reasons not to own the car.<br><br>
