            In 1995, I bought my Neon at a dealership. A couple had purchased it new and later decided on another vehicle (lucky them) and traded their new Neon in with under 12,000 miles for something bigger to suit their family. The car is a nice bright red color, came with a luggage rack, dual side airbags, power steering, a/c, etc. It was very clean and since it was the closest thing to a new car I'd ever bought, I loved it! Within the first year, part of the clutch cable broke off and lodged itself in the transmission somewhere and the whole transmission had to be yanked out to fix it and the the clutch cable had to be replaced TWICE! The following year, the 'Special' paint job began to crack and peel, beginning with the protective coating and working it's way all the way down to the primer and my airbag light came on (and is still on) for some reason unknown to the dealer. The following year, not many problems sprouted and I thought my lemon was slowly mutating into lemonade. Not so lucky was I! In the next year, the head gasket blew and had to be totally replaced at my expense (warranty ran out by then) of almost $1,000. I am still paying on the car, and after putting all that money into it, I will be forced to keep the poor dilapidated beast until I die. I immensely dislike this vehicle and I am convinced that it dislikes me just as much. Nonetheless, we will be life long partners. Beware the 1995 Neon, friends.<br><br>
