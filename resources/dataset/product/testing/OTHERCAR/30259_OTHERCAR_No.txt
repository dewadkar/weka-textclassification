            This camera is highly NOT recommended by this writer. I bought it on eBay, brand new in the box for $60. Advertised as easy to use, great quality. Well, I didn't expect great quality for what I paid, but I did expect to be able to take digital photos and be able to upload them to my computer. Fresh out of the box, it was very difficult to get it to actually take photos. Once they were taken (it only holds 16 photos) it was EXTREMELY difficult to get them uploaded. The quality was horrid to the point of almost not being able to recognize the photo. Flash took forever to get ready and didn't go off but once. After one successful upload, we've been unable to get it to work again. The WORST $60 I've ever spent. 

Their website lists a local camera shop as the &quot;authorized repair shop.&quot; Well, we went there. They've never heard of Agfa or this camera and have no idea why they are listed on the website. This is a national chain camera shop that Agfa is sending people to, and they have no idea who Agfa is. 

This camera is a waste of money and I would hate for others to throw theirs away as we seemingly did.
