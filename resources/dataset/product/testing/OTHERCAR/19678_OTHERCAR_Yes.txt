            OK, you're not going to confuse the Saturn with a Mercedes, or even an Acura.  But, for the price, this is an extremely nice car.  I have a 1999 and, compared to earlier models (from what I've heard), the pick up is not bad.  I do a lot of highway driving and have never experienced an acceleration problem.

The car is also roomy, for a compact.  I test drove this along with several other compacts and the Saturn was the most comfortable.  For example, compared with the Escort, the Saturn feels like a Cadillac inside - you know, the big white kind that your grandfather used to drive. Unlike that Cadillac though, the Saturn gets good gas mileage.

If I had one complaint, it would be the engine noise.  I had heard that this was a problem with the Saturns, though I was told that the 1999 model is better then previous versions.  While I can't compare my Saturn to earlier models, I feel that the 1999 Saturn engine is quite loud.  If you don't drive with the radio on, this may be a problem.  But, if you're like me and like to listen to music while driving, the engine noise shouldn't distract.<br><br>
