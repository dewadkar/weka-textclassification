            many auto repair shops are making money by repairing dilapidated lincoln continentals.  our family has had it for a while since it was brand new.  we've had to take it into the shop at least a few times a year because of various problems.  made by FORD, this car gives new meaning to the phrase Fix Or Repair Daily.  

this is a great luxury car if you don't want to pay much for one.  the handling is great (when brand new, until the steering wheel and tires start to rattle during turns after on the road for a while), the ride is very quiet and smooth (until your ride control breaks down on you a few times a year, being very costly), and there is a lot of leg room for both the passengers in front and back.  truck room is spacious and accomodates the heaviest of loads without being significantly detrimental to the quality of the ride.  

although the interior comes in leather, you'd think a luxury car would be comfortable enough to sleep in.  i can only bear a few hours of sitting in the car until my bottom becomes raw and sore.  

definitly not a great luxury car for the family.  you'll have the kids crying.<br><br>
