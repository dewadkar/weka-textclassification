              <b>W</b>hile many (including me at one time) consider(d) the 200SX to be a flop, (in base and SE trims) there really are some noteworthy attributes that even the base models provide. A drive down to Clear Lake CA, and Robinson Rancheria; a casino in the Clear Lake area changed my whole perspective on this car and its duties as an automobile.  

   <b>F</b>or 1995 the front wheel drive Nissan 200SX comes in 3 trim lines, the base 2 door coupe, the sporty and more luxurious SE, and the top of the line, SE-R. While the SE-R comes with a 2.0 DOHC 4-cylinder engine that pumps out 140 horsepower, the base car, and my test/friend's SE model comes with a tiny 1.6 liter DOHC 4-cylinder that generates 115 horsepower at a relatively high 6,000 RPM, and 108 lb-ft of torque at 4,000 RPM. Transmissions include a 5-speed manual, and a 4-speed fully automatic transmission. 


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>


Off-the-line <b>acceleration</b> is really not this car's strongest attribute, in-fact it is downright slow. My SE was equipped with a lazy automatic transmission which really hampered any out-right fun-factor this car might have given. 115 horsepower may not sound like a lot, but this car only has a curb weight of around 2,300lbs, so I was very disappointed with what I thought was going to be a somewhat exciting experience. At idle the car is somewhat jumpy, jumping from around 700-1,000 RPM, this has been somewhat of the norm when it comes to very small displacement 4-cylinders mated with automatic transmissions. On 'take off' one should note that the 1.6 liter, 115 horsepower engine is relatively quiet, this could be in-part to the fact that the automatic transmission would up-shift before it reached a substantial RPM. 

<b>Handling</b> in the 1995 Nissan 200SX is not exactly sporty, but it does a good job tackling the twisty roads in extreme northern California. Even though it's a small car, the 200SX rolls through the turns, and the tires should grip much better for a car in this class. 

<b>Cruising</b> on highway 101 at speeds of around 65-75 MPH the 200SX could get very annoying; wind, engine, road, and larger cars passing left the driver and passenger with a need for ear plugs. At low speeds the automatic transmission would up-shift at around 30 MPH, this up-shifting at such low speeds did not help this engine when it was time to accelerate. Bumps, pot holes, or just rough roads in general were annoying in this car, but like with most sports/sporty cars this is to be expected. Hill climbing is poor, but it could be worse. The automatic transmission, on almost any hill, will automatically down-shift from 4th gear to 3rd, but once the transmission is downshifted you have access to all the 115 ponies so the 1995 Nissan 200SX will not leave you in the slow lane on inclines. 

<b>Braking</b> is good, despite the chinsey front disc- rear drum set-up, this car provided good braking power. This is the saving grace for this car in the performance category; it gets almost 38 MPG. Before taking this trip I insisted on taking my 1991 Geo Storm (see review) which also has a 1.6 liter unit but was mated with a 5-speed so I expected we would save a bundle on fuel, but alas we took the 200SX and I was simply amazed that we turned in <b>38 MPG</b> on the trip which included all sorts of terrain.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

 The <b>interior</b> of the 1995 200SX is modern and relatively roomy. The instrument cluster has a grand offering of useful gauges. The interior is no ghetto relation. The 1995 200SX offers a magnanimous supply of amenities. Standard amenities on the SE trim include dual air bags, a good sounding 4 speaker AM/FM cassette player, power windows and locks, cup holders ( best not used), Cruise control, tilt steering, and air conditioning. Optional amenities included a power sunroof but that was it; not bad!
The drivers position is good, and so are ergonomics. Rear vision, side vision, and outward vision are all adequate but not great by any means. The front bucket seats proved to be comfortable on long trips, providing decent bolstering for aggressive driving. The rear seats are made of the same cloth which were also fairly comfortable.  The cabin is not exactly spacious, however the front offers plenty of leg room. The rear is a bit tight, but proved to be adequate for my height; 5'6" for short trips. 

<i>Exterior Innovation:</i> 

The <b>exterior of the 1995 200SX</b> is my biggest gripe, and before I go on, the picture Epinions.com offers you of this car is not what this car looks like. The picture shown is a 1994 Nissan Sentra SE-R. When I first saw the 200SX back in the mid '90s I thought they were the coolest thing to come out of Japan. Today however I feel the car looks like a 1980s tennis shoe on 4 wheels, much like the first generation Nissan Altima's. There really are no major noteworthy styling cues, the SE does boast standard 14" alloy rims and fog lights. 

<i>Price, Reliability:</i> 

My friend has had hers for almost 3 years now, and I did my best to get all the details on her repairs and the previous owner's. Problems included, belts, power steering lines, leaking exhaust system, new brakes 4 times, and a new set of tires 2 times. This is what has occurred in 98,000 miles of ownership; not too bad. The price for these cars are a steal, originally these cars sold for around $16,000, today a 1995 200SX will run you between $4,000-$6,000 with less than 100,000 miles.

<i>Conclusion:</i> 

While not a sports car, the 1995 Nissan 200SX offers a sporting favor, with excellent fuel economy and a decent amount of luxury equipment. If you are looking for a used economy car, the 95 Nissan 200SX is worth a test drive.
