            Since Infiniti came out, about 11 years ago, they haven't been able to find a niche in the luxury car market.  Lexus which came out about the same time as Infiniti, has made a permanent dent on luxury car sales.  I took an extensive test drive of the new and hopefully improved 2002 Infiniti Q45 and the also relatively new 2001 Lexus Ls430.  I have rated a 2002 Q45 fitted with the $8,000 premium package.

Handling: Q45-9/10: The new Q45 handled surprisingly well, even without the optional sport package. I was able to take sharp turns with assurance. The Q45 was not quite up to the handling standard set by B.M.W., but it was perhaps one of the best handling Japanese sedans I've driven. Compared to the Ls430, the Q45 wins in this area. The Ls430's handling is greatly improved over the Ls400, but it falls slightly short of the Q45's.

Braking: 8/10: The brakes on the Q45 are much stronger than on the previous version. I took the car up to eighty miles per hour, and stepped on the brakes and felt little fade. However, The Ls430 wins narrowly in this category. The Lexus brakes are incredibly strong. 

Acceleration: 10/10:  The Q45 is an amazingly quick car. Infiniti claims 0-60 mph in 5.9 seconds. Judging by my test drive; I think this number is a bit optimistic. Off the line the car is a tad slow, and doesn�t really take off until over a couple thousand rpm. The Lexus feels faster than the Q45 regardless of test times. The Lexus is definitely quicker off the line, and feels every bit as powerful as the Q45. 

Interior/ gadgets: 9/10: The interior of the Q45 is 200% more luxurious than the previous version. The materials are of a greater quality, and there are many more gadgets. The most unique gadget has to be the rear view camera, which is mounted above the rear license plate. As you put the car into reverse, the navigation screen turns into a view of the area behind your car. This feature is more than a gimmick, I found it to be very useful. The Bose sound system is clear, but not nearly as great as the Lexus�s optional Mark Levinson sound system. The navigation screen is placed in a high area of the dash, which makes it easily legible while driving. The center console would look even more luxurious if it was covered in the wood that adorns the rest of the car. The premium package on the Q I tested included a rear seat with climate, radio controls, and adjustable seats ala Lexus LS430.  The seats are well sculpted, though they lack in support compared a B.M.W. for example. Even though the Q�s interior is quite luxurious, the Ls430 beats it hands down. The quality of materials in the Lexus are exquisite. The Ls430 has more gadgets than the average person would know what to do with. This is where the Ls430 REALLY shines!

Ride=9/10: The Q�s ride is quite smooth. The ride is not quite Lexus smooth, because it is stiffer. The Q�s ride and feel is definitely sportier than the ultra- luxury pkg.  Ls430 I drove. If you prefer an EXTREMELY smooth ride, the Ls430 should be your pick.

Depreciation: Obviously I can�t judge a  new cars depreciation, but generally Infiniti�s have depreciated quite rapidly. Much more so then a Lexus. 
Value 9/10: The Q45 I tested had a listed price of just over $59,000, which is well into the range of a nicely equipped Lexus Ls430. The Q45 appears to be a great value, but personally I would rather have a Ls430. The Q45 has a nice blend of luxury and performance, but the Lexus is my personal favorite.
