            The Kia Sportage comes with a prodigious set of options considering the price.  However, it is seriously underpowered.  The four-wheel drive is actually quite good and shifts on the fly.  The suspension handles pot-holes fairly well, but the Sportage tends to vibrate at highway speeds.  The back seat is very small unless you have a very short driver!
Overall if you are looking for a 4x4 on a tight budget, the Kia is not a bad choice<br><br>
