            Before I get into the specifics I should warn you my view of this camera may be tainted. I am very fussy about my gadgets. I frequently clean them, obsessively return them to their protective cases after use, and refuse to lone them to all but the most trusted friends. So, when I dropped my expensive A50 onto a concrete sidewalk - off a second story balcony, I lost my objectivism. The A50 survived the 15 ft. fall almost intact (I had to replace the compact flash compartment door), I was badly shaken though (smile). I feel guilty saying anything bad about it.

---

When I decided to go digital in the fall of 1999, I researched the digital Camera selection thoroughly. At that time the A50 was Canon's top of the line model in the consumer line up. I bought it because it got great reviews for picture quality and speed, had a tough aluminum shell and a compact size without any less features than its bigger competitors. I had owned SLR cameras before so I figured if I was going to lose out on manual control, I might as well gain with compactness.

I haven't regretted my choice once. This camera does everything I need and does it well. Here are my observations:

Focus - With my SLR's cameras I used to worry about focus. One of them had auto focus and I still fussed over getting it to focus on the right spot. With the A50, I don't have control over focus - its fully automated - and I haven't noticed. I don't think I have taken a 
single out of focus picture.

Exposure/Flash - pictures are well exposed and the manual exposure compensation has provided adequate control in the rare cases when I needed something unusual. The flash could be a bit brighter but it is typical of a point and shoot camera. It would be nice if I could use an external flash for indoor photos in low light.

Battery Life - The rechargeable batteries aren't cheap. They are a proprietary design only available from Canon. But they last a long time, charge fast, and are compact. I have two and together they provide enough power to fill a 32 MB card with pictures (about 100 pictures). I use the LCD about 80% of the time.

LCD - I love being able to see and show off pictures I have taken right on the camera. The A50 LCD is bright, crisp, updates very fast as the camera moves and only gets &quot;washed out&quot; in direct sun light which has never been a problem.

Rugged - the camera has a rugged aluminum case. This camera can take abuse without getting all scuffed up or scratched. Ignoring the story at the start of the review, I treat my &quot;toys&quot; well but if it were plastic it wouldn't still look brand new.

Picture Quality/Size - the camera takes excellent pictures! I always use the largest size with minimum jpeg compression. The results are excellent. There is a zero compression mode as well but I have never needed it. I fit 100 pictures on my 32 MB card. This is more than enough for any occasion I have used the camera at (Wedding, Weekend Trip, Week Vacation, Halloween Party).

Other - I recommend compact flash which the A50 uses over smart media cards. They are cheaper and available in larger sizes. I specifically recommend the Lexarmedia cards. They do appear to consume less power and work faster than standard cards. This is based on comparisons with the 8 MB Canon card that came with the camera. It was made by SanDisk.

Conclusion
I no longer worry about wasting film. The camera is a lot of fun. I haven't missed a single feature of fancy SLR cameras and I would highly recommend the A50 to anyone.<br><br>
