            First Impression:
I drove this on a test drive. I wanted to compare it to my explorer. The one I drove was a loaded out EX with DVD system. The black paint had multipule scratches and wasn't as glossy as I would have expected. Plus the exterior had these tacky gold badges and name plates. Inside, I felt as if I where squashed. Plus the interior had a plastic feel to it. Something I wasn't expecting to see on a Honda. Also I think Honda over did it with the Keys. They will cost $45-$50 per key to replace, if not more.
Drive train:
The V-6 has enough get up and go. I think it could use more mid-range power and low end torque. I don't suspect you could tow very much with it. The transmission shifts fine, but the shifter can get in your way, or you can inadvertently bump into the wrong gear like I did. I didn't have a chance to measure gas mileage, but it should be class norm. if not a wee-bit better. Plus they require premium gas if I remember correctly.
Interior:
The interior is nicely appointed, but: The seats need help. The are not supportive and are painful. The radio is fine, but could be a little closer. The 3rd row seat is not as roomy as my explorer. I just felt the interior had a very cheap feel to it. The DVD system was nice and worked well from what I gathered from the small demo of it.
Durability:
I can't comment here, except to say that it is a Honda. But it may fall victim to Hondas transmission woes, like some Odysseys have. 
Overall, I'd rather have an Acura MDX or 4-runner as far as the foreign SUV's go. I would take an explorer any day over those two, but that is just my love towards explorers.
