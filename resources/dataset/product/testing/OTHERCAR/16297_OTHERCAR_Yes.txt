            I just had to review this camera, but there wasn't an exact match for it here on Epinions... so I found the closest one.

This is my first digital camera and after much reading about them here, I decided I didn't want to go for the discount store special.  I wanted at least one megapixel, and I wanted to pay between $100 and $200.  So, when my most recent cheap 35mm died and I had need of a better camera, I started shopping for a digital online.  I wanted to purchase it at Sears, so I started there... and the HP Photosmart 215 seemed to fit my needs/wants and price range.

I am a fan of HP.  I bought my CD burner from them about 15 months ago and it is still going strong.  So it was natural to be drawn toward the brand name.

I found the instructions that came with the camera to be as easy and complete as the ones that came with my cd burner.  I like that.  Actually, the instructions were almost too easy, but for an advanced computer user like me, that is okay.  I am so used to helping my non-computer literate friends and relatives, that is nice to see that a company is trying really hard to take the heat off of us innocents.

The camera is amazingly intuitive for me to use.  I attached the wrist strap, put in the batteries, set the date, and was snapping pictures in under 5 minutes.  The menu control is pretty neat... sort of a combo dial and push button.  You spin it until you get where you want to be and then you push it in.  

The software was equally easy to set up.  It's a little bit harder to learn to use, but not that bad.  There is no instruction manual, but you can figure it out.  I am a person who learns best by jumping in and doing.  The software is best learned that way, I taught myself how to crop when there was nothing in the help file.  Photo manipulation is the hard part to figure out, but interfacing with the camera is a breeze.  It helps when you have buttons that say "download all photos" or "delete all photos".  I do the basic stuff in the PhotoSmart software and then complete my post production in my favorite program.

The resolution is important to me.  I want something that will look decent and not too pixelated when printed.  As much as I love my scanner, it is hard to control that pixellation with it.  The Photosmart 215 comes with three levels of detail... basic is 640x480, fine and superfine are both 1200x1600 according to the manual.  The fine is supercalifragilisticexpealidotious for me.  You can get 36 pictures on the basic setting, and 10 and 5 for fine and superfine respectively.    This is with the included 4MB compactflash type 1 card.  It supports all storage sizes, so the purchase of a memory card is a good idea.

The camera comes with 4 "AA" E2 lithium photo batteries.  I have been very careful in taking pictures, so as to save the batteries.  However, I think these will last a decent amount of time.  This is only the first day I have owned it, so only time will tell.

I like the box alot... it has "easy" "fun" and "share" on it.  It is very true of this camera.  It does a great job and is easy and fun.  I love being able to e-mail pictures to family minutes after taking them.

I got my HP Photosmart at Sears for $199.  It lists at $188 at Wal-Mart.  Shop around and you can get a good price on this lovely little camera.  It's great for snapshots and web stuff and seems very solidly built. 

I am looking forward to many years of use from it.  I also look forward to not having to wait for my pictures... not having to take my pictures somewhere... etc.  (Just a note, Target is carrying 25 packs of store brand photo paper for $8.99.)

I am again pleased by Hewlett Packard's quality and ease of use in their products.
