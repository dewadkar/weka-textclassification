            It will last much longer, anyway.  Everything that's written about the M3 as a driver's car is true.  Hold on to your gum and warn your passengers when you stand on the brakes!  A sweet 240Hp straight-6 that has the most broad, flat torque curve my butt has ever felt.  It pulls great from idle to rev limiter.  
The seats are excellent and supportive (I'm 6'0&quot; 185 lbs.)  The side bolsters may make it a bit snug for the portly types, though.  The rear seats are also better than the fronts of most other cars.  Four adult guys were comfortable during a spirited drive, and the extra weight didn't seem to affect the car's excellent balance.  I was also called upon to put a baby seat in the back, and it fit just fine.
Bitching department:
1. Sorry, but the practical engineer in me comes out when I respectfully ask BMW to DITCH THE STUPID BUTTONS!  It bugs me to take my eyes off the road to find the heater button, then find the fan speed buttons, then find the temp up and down buttons, then watch the display until the desired temp appears.  But wait, if you don't usually have passengers (and you're a vent-hog like me) you have to find the controls for the dual system and get that to blow the same tune.  (Dear Hans, please incorporate a &quot;sync&quot; function for the two zones) The buttons (including the radio and computer) are all of a similar size and shape which makes for too much fumbling when you should be driving.  Hey, call me old fashioned, but - round knob, counterclockwise is cold, clockwise is hot.     
2. As good as the brakes are, they are touchy with light pressure.  The soft stock pads tend to grab easily, making it feel a bit non-linear.  But drive this car hard and this effect is not apparent.
3. With 3 grand on the tach at 60mph, this pup needs the 6-speed.<br><br>
