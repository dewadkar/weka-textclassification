            This is a live report from a Dermatologist office in New York on the CoolPix 4300!  Ok... ok, not a live report, but a friend and teacher of mine during my medical residency years purchased this wonderful camera to archive the various things he sees on patients as a skin doctor. In fact, he uses the pictures as part of the patient record and as part of printed reports for referrals to him.  I had some time to spend at his clinic to see some patients with the bonus of playing with this camera (and having it compare with some of my other cameras).

<b>Me</b>

If you've read my reviews, you would see that I do quite a bit of research on the cameras I've bought (as well as being rather partial towards Canon and Nikon cameras... usually in that order).  I use a variety of sites to do my research and if possible test out a version if a friend has bought one.  I've owned a Canon PowerShot S110, S200, S300, S330, and S40.  I've also owned a Nikon CoolPix 995, 5000, and 4500.  Several of the other cameras I've reviews were either owned by friends or quickly returned after buying (Minolta Dimage X).  Currently, I now only have the Nikon Coolpix 995 and 4500 as well as the Canon S330 and S40.  I am preparing to get the G3 when it comes out and possibly the S230 as well (both to be out in October).  Yea, I sold the CoolPix 5000 and the other cameras as well.  I'm trying to get rid of the 995 as well.  Oh well... back to the 4300!

<i><b>The Short Take</b>

It looks like the CoolPix 4300 is the successor to fairly recent CoolPix 885 camera.  Overall design is almost the same for the two cameras... however, there are a number of significant updates to the 4300.  The fact that the camera is 4 MegaPixels now instead of 3 MPs is one of those major updates!  A number of user accessibility improvements (like more scene modes) were added as well as some "pro" features.  You still get a 3x optical zoom and a high quality Nikon lens to boot!  Size isn't bulky like the CoolPix 4500 either... and the price is very nice for a 4 MegaPixel camera too!  Heck, the price is considered nice for a high end 3 MP camera!

The price is about $499 retail although there are places selling as low as $399!  Heck, the S330 was selling at this price a few months ago... and that was a 2 MP camera!  Talk about aggressive pricing on the CoolPix 4300!

I'm still trying to figure out if there are any major cons to this camera?!  Unless you're an photo enthusiast or a photo professional, I don't think many people can complain about this Nikon camera!

This really gives the CoolPix 4500 and the rest of the competitors something to chew on.  This definitely ranks as one of the best 4 MP cameras I've played with to date!

<b>Pros:</b>

1) Decent Sized Camera
2) Price
3) Point-and-Shoot operation
4) 4 MPs!
5) some "pro" features
6) 3x optical zoom
7) Nikon lens and camera quality
8) Compact Flash media
9) EN-EL1 battery used... just like most of the other CoolPix cameras.
10) Accepts add on lens that fit the other Nikon CoolPix cameras! (when you get the required adapter however)
11) Can accept 2CR5 battery when you run out of power on the EN-EL1 battery.

<b>Cons:</b>
1) Battery life is still short.
2) Still only a 16MB Compact Flash card including in standard package!
3) Marketed towards the basic consumer and not the professional market... so don't expect all the "pro" features.
4) Really should have a USB 2.0 port or Firewire port for faster transfer of these larger 4 MegaPixel files!

</i><b>Giving a few details about this sweet toy!</b>

Now I'm not going into all the little details about the CoolPix 4300... if you wanted all the little details, then you can look at the specs at www.NikonUSA.com or wait for reviews from www.dpreview.com and www.imaging-resource.com.  As for myself, I'm not a professional photographer, but I've been using digital camera for more than 2 years now.  I think I've improved quite a bit with features and details about digital cameras and can write a decent review about them.  Secondly, from my two plus years, I've become more partial towards Canon and Nikon digital cameras... I haven't played much with cameras outside of these two brands.

Now, back to the 4300.  The CoolPix 4300 is a decent sized camera 4 MegaPixel camera with a good bit of weight on it.  It is fairly compact with a silver matte like finish overall and a hard plastic body (can't have all metal bodies for every digital camera... especially at the price this camera is going for) that seemed fairly durable.  The 4300 had dimensions of 3.7 x 2.7 x 2.0 inches and a weight of 9.9 oz. with the battery and memory card.  The 4300 is significantly bigger than the Canon S200 and S330 cameras but much smaller than the CoolPix 4500.  For comparison, the CoolPix 4500 had dimensions of 5.1 x 2.9 x 2.0 inches and a weight of 13.2 oz!  That's quite a difference!  The CoolPix 4300 isn't exactly pocketable into your shirt or most pants pockets (at least not easily) but is easily carried in your jacket pocket.

The camera is fairly easy to hold and has a solid feel to it... it definitely can be used one handed and was meant to be a point-and-shoot camera first.  There are no sharp edges on the camera but a smooth flowing curves that help make the camera easier to hold for long periods of time.  The camera (like most cameras) was meant for right handed operation.  Most of the buttons and dials can be easily reached by your thumb or index finger while using the camera one handed.

The front of the camera holds the lens, flash, self-timer/red-eye reduction lamp, and the optical viewfinder.  Nikon is still using lens caps to protect the lens so you still get one of those in the package.  You'll note threads on the inside of the lens barrel.  Apparently, this is for adding adapters that can attach to the other established Nikon CoolPix lens accessories (yay!).

The left side has the Video Out jack only while the right side contains part of the CF card cover, the wrist strap eyelet, and the digital and DC In input jacks (both covered by a rubbery flap.  The bottom of the camera holds the battery compartment door with a plastic lock switch(the 4300 is using the tried and true EN-EL1 battery found in most of the other CoolPix cameras now.  The bottom of the camera also has a tripod mount almost at the dead center of the camera.  The top of the camera holds the power switch, the shutter button, and the mode dial.

The back of the camera holds several features including a clear and bright 1.5 inch TFT color LCD.  You also have the optical viewfinder (which still doesn't show you the entire shot you are about to record), a four way rocker pad, 4 buttons under the LCD with multiple functions, two buttons to the right of the LCD, and the Zoom rocker.

The 4300 seems to share quite a few features with its predecessor the CoolPix 885.  The camera still has only a 3x optical zoom and all the features of the 885 model.  The 4300 has added quite a bit more features like 4 metering options, improved white balancing, now 12 scene modes, and multiple shooting modes that include Single, Continuous, Multi-Shot 16 (16 pictures in one 2272 x 1704 frame), VGA sequence, Ultra-High Speed Continuous (30 fps in VGA), or Movie Mode (40 seconds max. in QVGA at 15fps).  Heck, that still not all the features, there is improved noise reduction on photos and several extensions to the manual shooting modes.  Movie mode is <b>NOT</b> able to capture sound with the short 40 sec movies!  There are 6 image size selections and 4 compression selections.  The best looking photo is on 2270 x 1704 resolution with Hi detail settings (TIFF file format) leading up to 16 MB picture files!

The 4300 on the Auto mode pretty much does all the work for you.  The camera makes all the adjustments and for the most part, you get some great shots with the camera.  However, it seemed a bit difficult to change the image size and compression quality without switching into the manual mode first.  Odd... hopefully Nikon will update the firmware to allow these kinds of adjustments in Auto mode.  It's a minor complaint but I suppose it may frustrate some users.

Overall, the 4300 seems to borrow quite a bit from the CoolPix 4500 model but lacks a few features that a enthusiast or professional photographer would likely miss on a camera.  There are some buttons to make use of the camera much easier such as the transfer button when connected via USB to a computer and the quick review button (I know it's found on most digital cameras).  The four buttons under the LCD perform a variety of functions... one of the button being a dedicated menu button.  The other three handle functions like exposure compensation, erase image, focus mode, information button (that can also display a histogram for still photos), flash mode, and index display.

<b>Shots and Colours</b>

The images on the 4300 were pretty close to those taken on my 4500.  I will remind you that the pictures taken were of various skin lesions in a dermatology office and no, I will not show people the shots!  Also note that the shots taken by the 4300 were considered more than acceptable and accurate to be placed in patient files and consultation reports as part of the official medical record.  The shots were thousands of times better than the older method of a Polaroid camera!  The severe acne shot on the full 4 Megapixel mode with no compression could be easily enlarged to the 8x10 and 8.5x11 sized prints with no appreciable loss in quality.  The 3x optical zoom is likely to be enough for the majority of users.  Skin tones were reproduced accurately as well as the discolorations on the skin.  I would say that the 4300 overall color reproduction was slightly duller than the 4500 camera but not enough to make any appreciable difference to the majority of users out there.

The 4300 hasn't been taken out of the office for outdoors shooting so I couldn't make any comment on that yet.  Maybe when his office is less busy...

<b>Minor Problems</b>

After using the CoolPix 4500 and 5000 cameras (as well as the Canon S40), there are a few nagging problems that come to mind that apply to the CoolPix 4300 as well.  The problems are still minor but may become bigger problems in future digital cameras.

The lack of a faster connection port... with raw 4 MegaPixel images taking over 10+ MB of space, transfer times may be considered quite slow.  More and more users are likely to have external means of storing these files (like a portable hard drive that accepts CF cards to transfer files).  Sure you can buy a 256MB card for $90-$120... heck, you can buy a 512MB card for $150-$250 too.  That 512MB card will only hold 40-50 images at the highest resolution and minimal compression settings!  The ability to transfer images quickly becomes much more important in order to take more photos!

Nikon included a Lexar 16MB 4x card... this is a joke!  As I said before, 1 2270x1704 resolution shot with no compression takes up almost all the 15-16MB available on the card!  That's all you get... 1 shot at the camera's full potential!  You better buy at least a 256MB card and better yet, get the 512MB card!

Battery life is decent... the camera lasted through a 4 hour dermatology clinic session with an average of 5 shots taken at 10-15 minute intervals.  This is about 240-260 shots on a full charge.  Not bad but not great either.  You should consider a second battery if you like to take photos.

<b>Accessorize?!</b>

Remember that I mentioned threads on the inside lip of the lens housing... that accepts either one of two adapters for the 4300.  The two adapters allow for the use of the other various CoolPix lens attachments like the Macro COOL-LIGHT and the telephoto lens!

<b>Final Thoughts</b>

Nikon is starting to pour the pressure on the consumer digital camera market.  It seems that Nikon efforts are really paying off for them.  Regardless, we all win with this excellent overall camera that allows for some flexibility and creativity when you desire it but is simple enough for anybody to pick up the camera a shoot away.  The CoolPix 4300 is an excellent choice as your only digital camera or your secondary digital camera!  Then again, when I get the G3 from Canon, I wonder if there will be any significant differences between the two then (although the comparison would be fairer between the CoolPix 4500 and the Canon G3!).
