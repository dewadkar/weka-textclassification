            I owned both a DC265 and a DC290 before the DC4800.  I enjoyed both of the predecessors, but wanted a camera with more megapixels and faster processing. 

I bought the package that came with the extra 64MB card and an extra battery from Best Buy.  I promptly loaded in the newest camera firmware that was supposed to take care of the poor focusing in low light conditions.

I was reasonably happy with the camera at first. I was thinking I was doing something wrong with it and after a while I'd be taking much better pictures with some more camera experience.  Thinking I could fix the low light problems with an external flash (the internal one is puny), I bought an extenda-bracket from photosolve.com and a new Vivitar flash.  The extenda-bracket is necessary because the 4800 does not have a hotshoe.  Well, this did actually help, but now I was lugging around a fairly large contraption that my wife had no idea how to use.  Yep, I used that a grand total of 2 times.

Even in well lit situations I was getting some strange artifacts when taking pictures involving a blue sky.  There would be little blotches of artifacts that I had not seen in my 265 or 290 pictures.  

The colors also seemed a bit washed out compared to the brilliant colors I saw in my previous cameras.

On the positive side, it wasn't like these pictures weren't good enough for most of what I was shooting... eBay pictures and family snapshots.  But when I shot my company party, my wife's company Christmas party, my wife's company Halloween party, and then a later car show for a friend and got really bad results, I knew it was time to trade it in for something else.  It was just getting embarrassing!

I currently own a Canon Powershot G1 that I have used about 10 times and have been getting much better results (but I'll leave that for a later G1 review).  There are just too many good camera's out there to fool with the 4800 even if you can get reasonable pictures out of it 75% of the time.  I want something reliable.

If I could get my old DC265 to be 3.3 megapixel and as fast as the G1 or 4800 I'd jump on it.  Kodak just didn't do it with this one.
