            We bought our 1998 Mercury Villager after returning from living in Germany for three years.  We had driven a small compact car the entire time we were in Europe and were ready to find something with more room for our family of four.  We had shopped around and looked at every model of van we could find. We had not even considered a Mercury, figuring it would cost must more than other models.  We basically stumbled onto the Mercury Villagers in the car lot.  We were immediately impressed with the price and the look of the van.

  After driving it we knew we were ready to buy.  We've now had the van for a year and-a-half.  We plan to drive it until we've worn it out.  

I've always been a little apprehensive about driving vans, fearing they would be too cumbersome, but the Villager is as easy to manage
 as a car.  The captain's chairs are great for the kids because they can have some space of their own.  We can also put the kids in the back and take out the captain's chairs when we travel to give us more room for luggage.  The chairs can, however; be cumbersome and heavy to take in and out.  

I'm glad to see that the newer models have the driver's side sliding door.  This would definitely be a plus for our Villager.  It can be difficult getting small children into their car seats from just one side of the van.  If we had it to do all over again, we would definitely purchase the Mercury Villager.
