            First of all I will start out by saying I love this car!!!!
My first car was a 1984 Z28 that I bought from my parents for a reasonable price but ended up selling it because I had a growing family. Now I own a 91 Z28 because I loved my old car so much I had to have a new one again. The 91 and 92 camaro's are a bit unique as they have the spoiler on the back and the side skirts and front spoiler, they also have the very cool rims unlike the 82-90 camaro's. The 91 camaro comes in a 305 5-speed but if you want the 350 its an automatic. I prefer the 5-speed as it is much faster. I know this because my 84 was an automatic. The 91 Z28 can handle corners better than any car I have driven at high speeds especially if it is lowered but be careful it scrapes every speed bump in site and the front spoiler needs a paint job at least once every two years from scrapes. This car will burn rubber at any stop and will slide accordingly because of the rear wheel drive which is a plus nowadays with so many cars being front wheel drive. Its not just the performance that I love, its the fact that it is made solid, yes its a heavy car but when you open and shut the door you are opening something rugged not like opening a tin can. It looks great and recieves many good comments at stop lights and many people even take pictures. The exterior is bold and aggressive for its year. The interior has much to be desired. The radio is a bose but looks like it was from the seventies. It must be replaced. The guages are very well laid out and positioned. The back seats are very tight and are only good for kids or small adults. This is not a long haul vehicle, its a sports car. There is also some rattling that may occur when going over bumps but again its a sports car and some is to be expected because of the bumpy ride. Here in Nova Scotia our roads are bad so it may be more pronounced. I have found this car needs regular maintenance and even some extra maintenance but I drive my car hard so some is too be expected. Driving hard also keeps me in and out of the gas station frequently but it is a v-8. 

  All in all this car is for me a keeper, I will be passing it down to my children when I'm just too old to drive it as I am having so much fun with it, and will continue to enjoy it. If you can get you hands on a 91 or 92 Z28 you are lucky as mine will not be for sale. It will outperform the Mustangs stock for stock don't you worry. This cars price is very underated especially for one in good shape and I think they will appreciate in value over time not depreciate like most vehicles, especially since Camaro is no longer being used by General Motors. The 1991 z28 Camaro is one sweet ride.
