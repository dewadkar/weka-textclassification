            The Ricoh RDC-300 is a basic digital camera with average features. It can store about 100 photos in the unit (low quality mode) and allows easy browse from the LCD screen. It is light weight, and compact.

One of the drawbacks with this product is if that you have to hold the camera completely still when taking a photo. If there is any slight movement the image will be blurred.The subject as well has to be still. For taking scenic shots it would be suitable. For action shots, it falls short.

Another disadvantage is that is has no zoom feature. But when the model first hit the market, there were few others that zoom anyway. Now most all basic digital cameras do.

Storage is limited. There is built in memory with no expansion. If you fill it up with pictures you have to delete some to get more storage (or transfer to PC).

Photo quality is decent, and the build in flash doesn't usually over expose images.

All in all it is a decent camera, for the street price.
