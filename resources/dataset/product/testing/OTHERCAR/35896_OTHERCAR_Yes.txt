            I purchased my 1997 Tiburon in Feb 7/01. This was my first car. When i first got it i couldn't believe that it was only  8 grand.Many people in my area thought my car was in the price range of a 40 grand car. I told them what i had paid for it and they couldn't believe the price which i got it at.The car is very sporty looking inside and out. I put in a chrome kit inside to make the inside even more outstanding. The tiburon has a lot of power for only a 4 cylinder engine I was able to get it up to 210 km or 130 mph. Many people have tried to race me , most of the time the tiburon was able to win. The Tiburon has very comfortable front seats I'am 6'1 and there is more than enough room for me in the front. However bigger people should not sit in the back there is hardly any head room for someone of any height to sit in the back. Hyundai should have made the Tiburon a 2 seater instead of four. Many people  do not like hyundai because of the reputation it made for itself in the early days. Hyundai is working hard to change peoples view.The Tiburon has done so with its great looks and fast speed. The only problem i have had with my Tiburon is that the check engine light always seems to come on, and even hyundai technicians can not solve that problem. However it is not major , the only trouble is that the light is troublesome driving at night.
