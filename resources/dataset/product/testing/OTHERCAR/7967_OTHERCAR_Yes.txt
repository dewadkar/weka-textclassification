            I could hardly wait for the fun and excitement of owning a Jeep Wrangler and in 1997 my dream came true.  I looked everywhere for a white ragtop but had to settle for gunmetal.  Purchasing big tires and new wheels were a must before beginning my fun off the road.  I was all set to ride the hills and play in the mud when all of the sudden the jeep started cutting out and doing all kinds of strange things.  I immediately took it to the service dept where I made the purchase.  They tried to tell me I was running it out of gas.  I made sure the tank stayed as close to full as possible at all times and it still would sputter and backfire.  I took it back another 4 times in the first 8 months of ownership and they never seemed to find the problem.  My next step was to call Chrysler and see if they could help me out.  They advised me to go to another service dept and see if they could find the problem.  We made 3 trips to this dept and the problem still existed.  I made another call to Chrysler and they said to try somewhere again so we went back to the dept where I initially took the jeep.  This dept kept my jeep for 2 weeks and when I went to pick it up I thought finally it will be fixed and I will not have to worry with this anymore.  As I was driving from the parking lot of the service dept my jeep cut out backfired and all the crazy stuff it had been doing from the beginning.  It has been 2 years with this problem now and now I am in the process of a lawsuit to try to finally get something done.  I still recommend to everyone to buy a jeep.  The jeep has to be the greatest off road vehicle out there it was just my luck that I got a lemon and a crappy service dept.<br><br>
