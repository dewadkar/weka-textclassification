            I got a 4-door Kia Sportage because I needed the four-wheel drive capabilities for where I was living at the time and I loved it.  It would go just about anywhere I wanted to go and it was comfortable for me to drive(I am over six feet tall).  The dashboard is set up in a very readable manner and everything is within reach of the driver.  You can haul people and stuff without being crowded together.  I moved in it and didn't have a problem with space.  It is very comfortable for long drives or just running to the store, it doesn't have overly hard or uncomfortable seats like most of the SUV's I have driven or ridden in.  It is a good buy for just about anyone who likes to go four wheeling or just drive around.<br><br>
