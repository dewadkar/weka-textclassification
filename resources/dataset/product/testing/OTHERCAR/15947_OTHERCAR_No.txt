            I am sorry to report that I tried this camera for one week, and I was not satisfied.  First, let me preface by saying that I read extensive reviews on the camera, and 90% of the reviews were positive.  Also, the price was right, around $250, but unfortunately I have returned the camera.

As with all digital cameras, battery life is very short.  After 26 pictures, using flash, the batteries were completely gone.  Yes, 26 pictures, which is terrible in my opinion.  The viewfinder on the camera looks like the viewfinder on a camcorder.  It is constantly in motion.  Perhaps that is why the batteries get drained so quickly.

The real problem is the lack of a focus.  I was taking pictures of Hot Wheel cars.  The first car would be in focus, but everything else was a dizzy blur.  Without a focus, I had to get extremely close to my subject, which was difficult.  Allow me to emphasize the importance of a zoom lens.

Finally, picture transfers were easy, however, I could not use the PC to control the camera features, like exposure or deleting old photos.

After I returned, I bought the Epson 850Z.  I have been extremely impressed, and I love it.  I have written an epinion about it.

By no means am I a professional photographer, however, I know poor picture quality when I see it.  Stay away from this one.<br><br>
