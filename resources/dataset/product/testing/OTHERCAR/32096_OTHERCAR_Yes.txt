            Originally designed for the European market, the Chrysler 300M has become a huge hit with American customers, thanks to its unique blend of virtues.
Although most domestic luxury cars still appear to be the result of a bigger-is-better philosophy, the 300M measures less than 200 inches in length, to better fit on narrower European roads and in smaller parking garages. But inside, the 300M reflects its LH-platform heritage by packaging the volume that's only offered by the largest, and most expensive, imports.
This spacious package is wrapped in sheetmetal that apes neither European nor American design trends but makes its own chiseled statement, one that almost everyone finds pleasing, belying the notion that only bland-looking cars have broad appeal.
In keeping with its Euro-centric intentions, the 300M is blessed with a suspension calibrated toward responsive handing, a powerful 253-hp V-6 engine, and Chrysler's AutoStick transmission, which remains one of the best manually controllable automatics on the market.
By delivering this combination of virtues at a base price of less than $30,000, the 300M is a terrific luxury-car value in a highly competitive market segment.
