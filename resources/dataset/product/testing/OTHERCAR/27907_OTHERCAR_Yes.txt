            Over the past six years I have owned three (3) used Nissan Maxima's.  I have found all of them to be exceptional.  You might ask why I have gone through three cars in this time period.  The answer:  I drive and average of 30,000 miles per year and usually only hold on to them until they have around 120,000 miles on them.  I have had nothing but great luck with all the maxima's I have owned.
The reason I keep going back to the Maxima is simple.  Reliability.  Every one I have had, has had over 75,000 miles on it and I drove them to over 120,000.  During that time I have not had to do anything other than routine stuff, i.e. tires, brakes, oil change.  I find the maxima to be the ideal for my sales job because it is a full size car that allows me to haul around all my samples as well as be roomy enough for four or five people to take out to lunch.  The mileage is good.  Usually 25 mpg, which is good for a full size V-6 3.0 litre engine.  Also one of the best features of the Nissan Maxima is the resale value.  You can shop around and find a good deal on a used maxima if you know what you are looking for and act quickly.  I have been fortunate enough to get a good deal on all three of mine and drive them for a couple of years and sell them for a couple thousand less than I paid.  Not bad when you figure you get 60,000 out of a car and only pay $2k.  You will lose $2k as soon as you drive a new model off the lot.
To sum it all up.  I am very pleased with the Nissan Maxima and would recommend it for anyone in the used car market.  My only advice would be to get a SE or GLE model.  They are a little bit sportier and come with the Bose radio system that sounds great.<br><br>
