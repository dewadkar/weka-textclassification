            As many folks know, the Jeep used to be an American Motors product.  I have driven AMC products exclusively since I learned how to drive in a 1959 Nash Rambler (pointy tail fins and all!).  When the Rambler finally wore out, I got a (please don't laugh) Gremlin, then a Hornet sedan, a Hornet Sportabout, and an Eagle Wagon before purchasing a 4-door 1990 Jeep Cherokee Laredo with 37,000 miles on it in 1993.  I drove it until May 1999, when I was forced to &quot;retire&quot; it after an accident, still running strong with 388,000 miles on it.  That's no typo... 388K.  

In those 6 years I had this thing in the mud, in the sand, in the snow... basically every surface imaginable, and NEVER got stuck once.  A quick flip into 4WD and I think I could have gone anywhere as long as there was gas in the tank and air for the engine to breathe.  

Favorite Features: 

The wheelbase/turning radius.  I could make a U-turn on an average residential street with this baby.  It fit into &quot;compact&quot; parking spaces, too.  

AC/Heater.  In a word:  FAST!  The AC could hang icicles on your nose in 20 minutes and the heater was even faster.  I especially liked the rear seat heater vents.  Terrific.  

Gas.  I loved that big 22-gal tank AND the 18 mpg I was getting.  On long trips I could gas up in the morning and drive all day without stopping (well, IF I could &quot;hold it&quot; for that long, LOL).  

Driver comfort factors.  Thanks to an old knee injury, I can't get in and out of vehicles that are either too low or too high.  My Cherokee was perfect.  I slid straight in and out and the tilt wheel made this effortless no matter what I was wearing.  The seat height in relation to the windows and controls was also perfect for greatest visibility and least amount of &quot;leaning&quot; to reach things.  I initially winced when I saw the factory sound system still in the car but soon knew why the first owner had never replaced it... it was awesome.  

Hauling.  I put more stuff in and on this car than most people can imagine.  I hauled sacks of concrete, bricks, fencing, people, furniture... I think I had close to 1000 pounds in and on it once.  I knew when I bought it that I would be doing all this and so I did put on heavy duty shocks, 6-ply tires, and an extra leaf in the rear springs.  This made for a pretty stiff ride when it was just me in there but with a load it drove like a Caddy.  

Get up and go.  Mine had the classic workhorse 4.0 liter straight six engine in it with the &quot;good&quot; transmission (looking under the car it's the square one, not the rectangular one) and boy could it leap off the line.  This thing would churn gravel if I even breathed on the gas pedal too hard.  I loved the responsiveness this gave me in sticky situations.  Unfortunately this feature also proved to be it's undoing, as my inexperienced &quot;new driver&quot; teenage son rolled it over in two separate accidents by giving it too much gas in turns.  The first time it ended up in on its side in a ditch.  A neighbor pulled it back over onto its wheels with his tractor and not only did I drive it out of the ditch and home without incident, but after a thorough going over my mechanic determined that the only damage was cosmetic... and it drove like a champ for 2 more years!  Unfortunately the second rollover was a &quot;total&quot; but believe it or not it STILL was driveable... AND my son walked away from both accidents with not even so much as a scratch.  

Least-liked Features: 

There's really only two.  One, the rear seat simply will not accommodate tall people.  My kids fit fine in 1993 when I bought it but by the time it met it's demise it was downright uncomfortable back there for my 5'8&quot; daughter and 6'4&quot; son, but I know this was the price I paid for the nifty turning radius.  

And two:  Too bad these things don't last FOREVER.  *sigh*  

Speaking of which, is anyone wondering what I bought after my Cherokee?  A Grand Cherokee, of course!  :-)  <br><br>
