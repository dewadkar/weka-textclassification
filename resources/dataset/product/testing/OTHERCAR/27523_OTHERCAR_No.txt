            I bought my red Jeep Grand Cherokee new in 1996 and am still driving it.  It's not been a bad car, but I don't think I will buy a new Jeep when this one dies.

OVERALL
I like the way it drives and handles.  I'm short so I like the fact that there are a myriad of ways to adjust the seat and I can see out and around me very well.  Plus the automatic driver seat memory has been a real convenience for my husband and me because there's a foot height difference between us.  The leather interior has worn like iron, even with dogs in and out and the occasional cat. All the interior instruments are handy and easy to reach.  I use the compass all the time!

PAINT
On this model of Jeep, the molding is painted which I found quite inconvenient.  I had a shopping cart run into it and peel the paint off.  The only way to repair this is was to replace the entire bumper. In contrast, when my hood was majorly scratched it only cost $30 to have it painted over.  In hindsight I would have preferred the Laredo's non-painted molding.

ENGINE
I own a V-8 and my dad owns a V-6.  I've driven his before and really I cannot tell the difference in normal driving between the two.  The V-6 has fine pick-up.  Perhaps the difference comes if you're towing.

REPAIRS
I always compare the quality of my Jeep to my husband's Infiniti J-30 because they were both bought new within a couple of months of each other and we've always had about the same mileage on them. In the 5 years that we've owned both vehicles I've had my Jeep in the shop on several occasions with one whopping $1500 repair on the differential.  Ouch!  We've easily spent about $4,500 in total repairs on the Jeep so far.  My husband's Infiniti has been in the shop for a mechanical repair only once in 5 years!

RECALLS
I've had the Jeep in the shop for numerous recalls over the years. The one that was the biggest pain was the spare tire recall.  There was a nice smaller size one in the back cargo compartment when I bought it.  Then they replaced that with a full size tire and it takes up a good portion of the cargo space and now we can't use the cargo area cover any more. Just a side note--our Infiniti has had no recalls in 5 years.

SIZE
We are a family of four.  On long trips I wish there were more cargo room and more leg room in the back seat area.  With a car seat in the back it's rather cramped.  My husband is tall and picky about how his seat feels and how much headroom there is.  The Jeep has not been a problem for him in this regard, although he never rides in the rear seat.

In closing, I would like to buy an SUV for my next car, but I would like a little larger model for our family road trips and one with a better repair history.
