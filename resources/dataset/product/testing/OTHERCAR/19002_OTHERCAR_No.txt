            I really wanted to buy a Tiburon. Great looks, great price, cool list of standard features and I don't know anybody else with one...but I drove the thing and well--it just doesn't measure up. 

Starting with the interior--not great. The designers seemed unable to make up their minds about the look and feel of this car. Some of the interior accoutrements seemed techno and "postmodern" some looked and operated like bargain basement Korean. And why mix and match air vents--two of them are rectangular, the rest circular--looks clunky.

Exterior--very cool car--clearly the design boys (and girls) in Pusan have been reading their Italian design mags--because the boys from Ferrari and Pinanferrina would be proud. Curves, undulations and even gills--best looking car in its class. I wish the boys from Acura would take a little direction from their Korean colleagues.

Performance--here's the problem--a six speed transmission is mated with an underperforming six cylinder engine that does not accelerate particularly well and has zero top end. The ride is a little slushy as well. 

The style is great--but the substance isn't there.

I bought an Acura RSX-S, doesn't look as cool, but is much more serious drivers car. The Tiburon is still a wannabe--kind of like the old Pontiac Fieros--great looking cars with zip under the hood.
