            I was not the happy Saturn owner I thought I would be.  The buying process was wonderful, I wish all the manufacturers would follow it.  My car, however, was not so wonderful.  It leaked transmission fluid for the better part of a year before they finally fixed it correctly.  This happened only after a couple of irate calls to Tennessee and my threatening to hire an attorney and &quot;lemon law&quot; my vehicle(actually we were just a few days shy of doing so when they &quot;fixed&quot; everything).  Also, Saturn's service people used to ask peculiar questions about what I was doing to this car, insinuating the problem was with me and not the car.   I found their attitude insulting.  I have been driving for 20+ years with only 1 accident and 1 traffic ticket, both received over 10 years ago!  I traded in the vehicle last May on a Toyota and have never been happier. <br><br>
