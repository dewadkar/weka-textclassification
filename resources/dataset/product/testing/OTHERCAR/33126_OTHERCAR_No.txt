<b>Strengths</b>: Has all the essentials at a low price. BUT all strengths are overshadowed by all the problems. 


<b>Weaknesses</b>: Very CHEAP quality hardware.


<b>Overall</b>: DO NOT buy the chevy malibu no matter what kind of a deal the dealer gives you ! You will have many headaches to come after the first three months of ownership. Spend the extra $4000 and get an Accord. Five of my friends who have accords have never had the problems I had with the Malibu and they have had their cars from 3 to 10 years.

DO NOT purchase any extended warranty plan (for any GM car for that matter). IT is USELESS. Every problem has NOT been able to be covered because it seems EVERYTHING is under wear and tear which is NOT covered. He uses it to commute only 20 mi total per day. And once every 2 months they make a 400 mi trip to LA. 

they have had the rotors replaced THREE times, my water pump, battery (which decided to spontaneously explode and leak while parked in my garage one day), and something called a control arm for the front suspension. Oh, did I mention that only TWO MONTHS after they got the car, they had to have the entire powertrain chip replaced because it was faulty ? This ridiculous MAJOR problem took 4 weeks to correct !!!!

Chevrolet has TERRIBLE service and the claims people seem to be instructed to only find excuses why your repair is not covered in the warrantee. 

What a BIG disappointment. they thought I'd give American cars another chance. THey failed miserably, especially on the warrantee service. Those guys just don't get it yet.
