                 The 2002 Accent is a nice little car.  Then again, I was walking before I bought mine (my '84 Pontiac Sunbird threw a rod), so my expectations weren't too high.  I deliver pizza, so I needed something dependable and good on gas.  Bingo and bingo.  25,000 miles later I haven't had a hint of trouble.  Well, nothing that was the car's fault.  More on that later.  
   
     The car comes nicely equipped.  Standard features on my model include power windows, locks, and mirrors (which are so nice to have), cold-blowing A/C, and a smooth-shifting 5-speed.  I tested the automatic version, but it accelerates quite a bit slower.   Mine is a GS, which I thought meant "Gas Saver."  Turns out it is the beefier 1.6 liter engine.  Don't laugh; the self-tuning twin-cam engine can scoot, and it does get good gas mileage.  I average 30 in the city, 35 highway. Braking is very nice despite lacking ABS, and vision is outstanding.  Creature comforts include an arm-rest, lighted ashtray (which is great for storing and retrieving coins), self-adjusting lumbar support, and a manual gas-release latch.  Surprisingly, the headlights shut off automatically upon removing the key (no dead battery), and a door chime will annoy you to death if you leave the keys in the ignition upon opening the door.  For such a low base price, it packs a lot of goods.  
    
     Performance has been spirited.  I've taken this thing through deep puddles, around sharp turns, to maddening stops, and you name what else.  I have not been gentle, period.  And in my job, stops and starts are all too common.  The car never breaks down or complains, but keeps coming back for more.  It does whine a bit when going above 70, and the road noise is maddening with the windows down, but that's what the CD/radio is for, right?  
     
     Now for the bad stuff.  Actually, I had two things happen, but neither was the car's fault.  First, a group of punks shot marbles at my car with some sort of air gun.  These things happen when you have a pizza company car-top on your Accent.  The windshield and front passenger mirror were damaged, and replacement cost over $350.  A few months later, I backed slowly into a small fire hydrant and bent the rear axle and cracked the rear bumper.  Damage this time was over $1000.  Thank God I had a low deductible, but the reason I'm telling you this is simple -- the car damages easily and is expensive to repair.  Now I've read other reviews that knock the safety of the car, and to that I say "rubbish!" It has a sturdy cage, excellent braking, and maneuvers very well under duress.  I came around a bend one night at 70MPH, and let's just say a deer and I had a moment of truth.  He was standing; I was swerving.  I cajoled him into moving by laying on the horn, but, surprisingly, the car nimbly moved to the side while braking swiftly.  Yes, the sheet metal dents and damages easily, as evidenced by my hydrant encounter, but no car in the world will adequately protect you during a brutal head-on encounter or a speedy drivers-side impact: don't fool yourself into thinking otherwise. Nobody should be looking for a car that's good to crash anyway, but one that is good to drive safely.  For that, the Accent more than meets the standard.  As I said from the outset, it's a good little car.
