            Despite the given title of this review, overall I would rate it favorably.  The one little tidbit that seems to be commonly left out is it's available torque, or more specifically lack thereof.  My wife and I bought this particular vehicle after doing considerable market research and at that time thought it the best deal.  Actually, after reading all the published specs on the similar vehicles (Nissan Pathfinder, Toyota Forerunner, Isuzu Trooper, Ford Explorer, and Chevy Blazer - all with the same engine and trim options) .  We opted for the 4WD LS model feeling that it offered the best value.  It wasn't until after we bought the vehicle and had a trailer hitch installed that we learned the truth.  When it comes to published specifications, take them with a grain of salt!  This SUV, like all the others in it's class is rated for a maximum of 5000lbs tow capacity.  Downhill, maybe!  We have a 14ft. Boston Whaler.  The weight of the boat and trailer is supposed to be around 2200 lbs.  If there are NO hills around (and most boat ramps are inclined!), the Montero Sport does all right.  Add in some terrain, and we can't get out of first gear.  The published torque on this particular model was 172ft/lbs.  It turns out that this vehicle has an absurdly inefficient drivetrain, losing somewhere around 35 to 40ft/lbs from the engine to the wheels.  
   Now that I'm finished with that little quibble, I would like to say that if you need reliable foul weather transportation capable of carrying four adults in relative comfort, this is your car.  The shift-on-the-fly four wheel drive system works flawlessly, and the vehicle is balanced beautifully.  It climbs like a mountain goat, and looks very attractive tooling down to the local fresh market.  Put in a decent transmission, and it will be the perfect SUV!<br><br>
