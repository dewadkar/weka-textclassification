                 The only reason I haven't bought a Cruiser yet is I can't decide what to do with the new mini van we just bought; I'm not willing to give up my convertible Mustang.  
     I first saw a PT at the L.A. auto show and, like everyone else mobbing the compact retro vehicle, I thought it was really cute.  With all the other gawkers of all ages in attendance, I barely got a glance inside, but picked up literature to learn about the interior layout and what could possibly be under that narrow hood besides several tired squirrels in a wire cage.
     My next experience with a PT was in New Mexico. I was driving down the highway near town, passing the local Chrysler dealer, when something deep red and bright caught my eye on the dealer's display hill out front. I clicked on the blinker and made a sharp turn into his lot.  Luckily for me, no one was busy, so I talked with a salesman, sharing my information with him about this vehicle I had admired from afar but had not yet experienced.  As we walked around it, he pointed out the sticker price of a little over $18,000 and told me they could only order for customers; this was the only Cruiser they would get this year, so they would keep it for a demo.
     Best part of my stop:  I got to drive the cutie.  It's responsive, handles predictably, sways a bit in fast curves, but doesn't wallow.  The only thing I found to complain about was the rather doggy acceleration with the automatic transmission it had.  However, with a 2.4 liter, 150 horsepower engine, maybe it's more enthusiastic with the 5-speed.  For a sporty vehicle, I've always preferred shifting when I think the engine's revving enough.
     Overall, this is a terrific, fun, highly usable vehicle.  I'm ready for it.  Now if I can just convince my husband and two collies that we can downsize.<br><br>
