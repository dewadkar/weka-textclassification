            I Currently own A 1999 GTI GLX VR6,And have fallen in love with
this car. their are many Pros but few Cons, the Pros are obvious
with the unique styling, The monster under the hood, the Recaro
sport buckets (heated), great breaking, and the interior well
worthy of the upscale german cars that we love. as far as Cons 
they are relatively easy fixes, and volkwagen has already fixed
one, the mushy suspension, they now offer sport springs that lower 
the vehicles ride hight, as well as stiffen the the suspension 
(thanks volkswagen), as far as the tires they are not the best 
performance tire, but i couldnt waste the stockers. other than
those easily solvable problem this could probably be the greatest
car for under 30grand ever! the gawk factor is still high, not 
many people know what it is. though most people only see the rear 
of this car. the volkswagen emblem in very recognizable. the styling 
is sleek and modern, and the headlights are fantastic not only for 
driving but for thier aestetic value as well. the interior lighting
is unmatched in all aspects the ergonomics, as well as the readibilty.
as far as road mannerism this car reacts to all driver input very
well, the power band is large enough to pass in fifth gear agressivly.
I have driven other imports namely japanese, and their engines require 
the high rpm driving that calls for constant shifting. well to sum up 
my review, I would strongly suggest that you get down to your 
volkwagen dealer and get on their waiting list and pry. later.<br><br>
