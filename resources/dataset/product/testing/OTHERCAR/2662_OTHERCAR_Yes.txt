                 Right off the bat anyone looking at a Jeep should know they are no luxury car. They are a very offroad worthy vehicle right from the dealership. All of these new "SUV's" have plenty of sport, but where's the utility. I don't see too many people hauling mulch in their Escalade.
     The Wrangler is not the most comfortable ride, but it grows on you. I've always owned cars with a nice smooth, quiet ride. The Jeep can ride a little rough, but I expected that. Despite the rough ride, it gives a very solid reassuring feeling on the road.The only real complaint about the ride is the noise from the soft top on the highway. With the windows up it is not too bad, but when the windows go down it gets a little annoying.
     The power is o.k., but spend the extra $ on the 4.0l engine. Mine has the 2.5. It's has good torque, but lacks power on the highways, especially uphill. For day to day driving around town it's fine. It averages about 15mpg with city/ highway mix driving.
     Offroad performance is not an issue. It does a great job even in 2wd. 4wd is seldom needed for light duty offroad, but is great insurance in the Cleveland winters. It can shift on the fly up to 50mph. 4 low is ever more seldom needed, but is a pleasure when it is. 
     Interior comfort is average, but you'd have to expect that from a Jeep. Headroom isn't an issue, but legroom might be if you're over 6ft. tall. The seats are fairly comfortable, but could use some side bolsters to hug the driver a little better. Offroad I find myself repositioning myself alot on the seat due to lack of grip. All guages and controls are placed well. The heat works very well to comfort anybody worried about the notoriously cold ride. The soft top has been redesigned. It is quieter than in the past. There are no drafts noticed in the winter months. Putting the top down takes about two minutes once you get the hang of it.
     Overall I'm very happy with it. It exceeded my expectations. It's fun to drive around in the snow and mud. And you can't beat a sunset cruise with the top down on a warm summer night. Just a warning though... It's an addiction. There are so many aftermarket parts to customize your Jeep to set yours apart from others. The Jeep is the Harley of the auto world.
