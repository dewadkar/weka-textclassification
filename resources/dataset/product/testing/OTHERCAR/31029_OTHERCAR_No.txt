            I recently drove a 2002 Chrysler Sebring Coupe at my local dealership.  While the Sebring is a compent car, I did find some flaws to its design.


EXTERIOR
This is one area where the Sebring shines.  This is an absolutely gorgeous car.  The design is very lean and the lines flow very smoothly.  The optional 17 inch wheels really beef up the sporty look of this car.  I especially like the upward turned back end design of the Sebring.  Overall, the interior is very impressive.

INTERIOR
Unlike the exterior, the interior of the Sebring is quite different.  The dash and interior materials are made with very cheap, hard plastic which is unpleasing to the eyes and touch.  The instrument panel gauges were small and hard to read.  I was also dissapointed in the amount of interior space with the Sebring.  Granted, this is a coupe, but for being as midsize coupe, the interior space felt cramped.  In the end, I was unimpressed with the interior of the Sebring.

ENGINE/RIDE
The Sebring has a 3.0 V6, rated at 200hp.  The engine is built by Mitsubishi, which builds its Eclipse on the same platform of the Sebring.  The model I drove was equiped with an automatic transmission, with the automanual mode.  The car had plenty of power throughout the RPM's and was fun to drive with the automanual tranny which allows you to manual up and downshift.  Also, the Sebring is fuel economy is rated at 21 city and 28 highway, which is pretty good consider the engines size and power.  The overall ride of the car was pretty good, and it handled well considering its size.   

VALUE
The Sebring I drove was the top of the line LXi and it stickered for $25,000.  I'm not sure if the Sebring is worth the money, considering the lack of interior space, and questionable build quality.  But I'm sure Chrysler can find a market for the car, but I wouldn't recommend it based on my personal opinion of the car.
