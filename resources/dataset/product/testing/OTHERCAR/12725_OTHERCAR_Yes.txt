            I bought my Mitsubishi Montero Sport after I had an accident in my Mitsubishi Eclipse. I LOVE the Mitsubishi brand. I wouldn't drive anything else. I needed something roomy for traveling back and forth to college. It is spacious and comfortable.

I love almost everything about this vehicle. I don't care for it too much when it is windy and raining outside. It is top heavy and tends to &quot;wobble&quot; alot. It is an awesome feeling to drive this vehicle though. I would recommend it to anyone that I can. My fiancee has a car and we always have to take mine everywhere we go. He loves driving it. It is a very smooth ride and you feel like you dominate the road. 

I suggest you buy this vehicle if you have children or pets that would be riding in the car. Also if you do any amount of traveling or have to haul things. I don't suggest you buy this vehicle if you like to &quot;play around&quot; on the road. I'm not sure but I've heard that SUV's can be very dangerous on curves and such.<br><br>
