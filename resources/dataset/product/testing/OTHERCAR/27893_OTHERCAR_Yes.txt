            As a previous owner of the Suzuki Esteem, I found this to be one of the most reliable and outstanding performance automobiles I have ever owned. 

I had to drive in excess of 1000 miles weekly and never encountered the first problem with this car. On the down side it could have been designed with a bit more interior room.

On a scale of one to ten this car would rate a 10 on performance and a 6 on being comfortable. This car is wonderful for the individual who needs to do a great deal of highway driving earning an average of 35 to 40 mpg on the hwy and 28 to 35 mpg city. This car is not designed for comfort on long trips where a family is concerned.

Economical, affordable but lacking in the comfort zone.<br><br>
