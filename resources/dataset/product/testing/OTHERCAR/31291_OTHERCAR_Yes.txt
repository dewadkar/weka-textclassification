            On top of all of the other virtues that make a Volvo a Volvo - safety, durability and functionality - V70 XC is a 5 person snowmobile.  It is the thinking man's SUV, or at least for the 90% of SUV owners who neither tow trailers nor go off-road.

My 1999 XC has 10,000 trouble free miles on it and is the fourth Volvo I have owned.  I hesitated to write an epinion until the recent large snowstorm (1/25/00) we received in Virginia.  (After all, the technical information and professional opinions are readily available.)  The wagon handled hilly, unplowed roads with 10 inches of dry snow without a hitch. I could start and stop at my pleasure and the drive-train seamlessly switched from FWD to AWD.  The antilock brakes readily brought the car to a controlled stop.  In real snow country, the addition of studded snow tires should make this car unfazable.

Volvo introduced the V70 XC in 1998 and it has remained basically unchanged through the 2000 model.  The primary change this year was the inclusion of the whiplash protection seats (WHIPS), first introduced in the S80.  The 2000 model year will be a short one, with 2001 model coming out early and sharing body styling cues with the S80.  The new V70 is out in Europe and I would watch the Volvo web page (www.volvocars.com) for more specific details of it's release here.  Additionally, the V70 AWD  was phased out this year, leaving Volvo with two AWD wagon models - the XC and the high performance R.

The current XC comes in basically two flavors, loaded, and loaded with leather seats, wood trim, sunroof, and a more powerful stereo.  The majority of the vehicles on dealers' lots appear to be the latter.  There is a third minor variant, the XC SE, which lies somewhere in between.  Mine is the &quot;loaded without the options&quot; variation.

Volvo has a long tradition of safety features - four wheel disc brakes, three point harnesses and crumple zones.  The V70 continues that tradition with second generation airbags, side airbags, and side impact protection (SIPS).

The car handles well, but definitely feels the additional 500 pounds heavier than the non-AWD Volvo.  With sturdy 15-inch wheels, it can handle rough roads and potholes.  The car also seems to have the good front to rear weight balance that my earlier Volvos had.  I lived in the Rocky Mountains of Wyoming and New Mexico for seven years, and my 144S and 244S would both telegraph immanent trouble on winter roads before it happened.  In seven winters I never put the car in the ditch once.

The engine is 2.3 liter, light pressure turbo, in-line 5 cylinder, which produces 190 horsepower. While not a quick as the &quot;full&quot; turbo, the &quot;R&quot; model, the XC accelerates strongly from either a stop or at highway speeds.  The car averages about 20 mpg around town (stop and go traffic) and about 27 mpg on long road trips, even with a Thule roof box.  With regular oil changes (every 3,000 miles) two of my earlier Volvos cleared the 200,000 mile mark.  The third, a 1995 850 Turbo is at 56,000.  The 850 experienced heat deterioration of a seal for the oil return line from the turbocharger at 45K, and was replaced under warranty. I will be keeping an eye on that seal in the XC as well.
  
The fit and finish seem to keep improving on the cars, as do the functional niceties.  The wagon comes equipped with a retractable screen in the rear seats, to keep packages from flying into the passenger compartment during a sudden stop, or to keep Fido from joining you in the front seat.  The rear seat belts come equipped with child safety seat locks which are supposed to eliminate the need for seat belt clips.  Strangely, the front passenger seat has one too.  In my experience these work OK, it seems to depend on the height of the safety seat base.  (In an aside, Ford Motor Company, which Volvo is now part of, gives seat belt clips away free for the asking, regardless of the make or manufacture of your car.)  The rear seats have a 60/40 split and can be dropped very quickly for large items.  Additionally, the front passenger seat will also fold forward for really long items like a rolled carpet.  The front seats are also heated, a nice feature on cold winter days, and have an adjustable lumbar support, great for long road trips.

The stereo is more than adequate (with kids in the car there is only so loud the volume can go) and simple to use.  When in radio, cassette or CD mode, pushing the volume knob will pause the music. I found the original six speaker configuration, four in the front, two in the rear doors, a bit bassy.  The car is prewired for eight speakers and it took me five minutes to install the additional two speakers in the rear pillars at home.  The sound is now greatly improved.

The roof rack will accept a large number of accessories from Volvo, Thule (who makes some of the Volvo accessories), and with adapters Yakima.  The aftermarket roof rack business is fairly competitive and often offers better deals for similar equipment than the dealer.  If you don't carry a lot of stuff on the roof, the &quot;cross bars&quot; will work fine.  If you are the type to maximize your rack's capacity, the &quot;load bars&quot; have an extra few inches with their overhang.  Even without cross bars, the front to rear rails generate some wind noise and, I imagine, would detract from the enjoyment of the sunroof at highway speeds.

The XC isn't the biggest vehicle on the road, or the toughest looking.  If you need true off road or towing capability, sheer bulk for intimidation, or an &quot;image&quot; at the mall, the XC isn't for you.

The Volvo V70 XC is a little tank, in the best sense of the term.  It is safe, sturdy, well thought out, and with AWD, will go most anywhere.  And unlike a tank, and most SUVs, it gets decent gas mileage.
