i bought the GLX V6 model about a year ago.  back then, i had no problem with the gas situation, but now i pay about $1.79 for gas, fill up to about $27.00 and get to ride around for only 250 miles and most of that is highway.  

along with that, the speed is nothing to be too impressed over.  yes it is a 32 valve which is good but id feel like a whale off the line.  the 190 hp is lost somewhere inside the car, definitely not in the engine.

The car however does have an amazing interior, specially at night where the blue and red light the entire car.  the volume knobs on the steering wheel at great. the trunk space is amazing. the back seats are incredibly comfortable along with the front seats.  

for some reason, the arm rests in the door are starting to peel away, maybe its the high heat here in miami.  either way, it made the car feel cheap, almost embarrasing.  just last week the rear left door wont open. im getting it checked out soon.

all in all, i love the car. i feel it gives me personality without being fancy(audi A4).  its luxury is hidden to the driver and passenger only.  i like how its a respected car without the "flashy-ness".
