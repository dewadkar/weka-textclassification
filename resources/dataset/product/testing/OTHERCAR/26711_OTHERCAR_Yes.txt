            I have been casually shopping for a digital camera for about a year now.  With Christmas and an upcoming vacation, I finally decided to take the plunge into purchasing one.  Even after gathering all the information I could about digital cameras, I didn't want to spend a large sum of money on one and then be severely disappointed.

I chose the Olympus D-360L because I trusted the brand name, it was relatively inexpensive and it was available at Staples.  One of the wonderful things I learned about Staples during the shopping experience was that they would price match ANY competitor, including online retailers.  All I had to do was find the lowest overall price (overall, including shipping costs) and bring a printed copy of the site into the store for matching.  I was able to save over $60 off of Staples in-store price!

Immediately after bringing the camera home, the picture taking started.  The camera has a very nice LCD view finder, so you don't have to hold the camera up to you face.  I was impressed that even in low light, the camera picks up images pretty well.  The auto-focus also works great, I've been right up to my dogs face and snapped a clear picture that was nothing but nose.

Navigating through the pictures on the camera can be a little slow and cumbersome.  It would also be a challenge for someone with big fingers, as the buttons are small, close together and recessed.

Connecting it to the computer was easy.  The software loads right on to the computer and is very self explanatory to anyone familiar with Windows software.  The camera is equipped with a serial port connection, which is how the included software communicates with the camera.  The major draw back to this is that you have to shutdown the computer to connect the camera to the serial port and you have to shutdown again when disconnecting.  I only went through this a few times before purchasing a SanDisk SmartMedia card reader that connects to the very quick USB port on the computer.

This brings me to another point, the different types of memory media used by all the different cameras and MP3 players and the lack of understanding of them by big retailers.  While shopping, I learned that there a 3 different types.  I've never heard that anyone is better than any other.  But trying to find salespeople that understand there are 3 different types is nearly impossible.  I'm not sure if the corporate buyers even understand this.  After purchasing the camera at Staples, I went back a few days later to buy more memory and the USB port card reader.  Unfortunately the knowledgeable salesperson that sold me the camera wasn't there and the person behind the counter obviously new less then I did about digital cameras and the different types of memory.  I ended up buying the correct memory, but the USB port card reader for a different type of memory.  The next day, I returned the card reader, hoping to exchange it for the correct one.  This time, there were only ditzy high school girls working in the store that couldn't even understand why I was returning the reader.  I came back to the store when my original salesperson was working and found out that they don't carry the USB reader for that type of memory.  I finally ended up with the correct USB reader from Circuit City.

The USB port SmartMedia reader makes retrieving your pictures so fast.  The serial port can take about 30 seconds per picture, while the USB port takes about 2.

The picture quality is unbelievable!  I had expected grainy or blocky pictures, there were very clear even printed on regular paper using my HP T45 multi-function printer.  I haven't tried using photo paper yet, as it is fairly expensive and haven't taken a good enough picture yet worth printing (this is my fault, not the camera's!)

I've had the camera for about 3 weeks now and am still using the original set of batteries.  The flash is almost always used and I must of taken almost 200 pictures by now.

I'm very pleased with the Olympus D-360L and would recommend it to anyone looking into making their first digital camera purchase. <br><br>
