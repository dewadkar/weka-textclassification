            After test driving the BMW, Lexus, Acura and a couple others, I recently took delivery of my new 2001 Audi A6 2.7T Bi-turbo with all wheel drive. 

After just 700 miles in the car, I can say with good conscience that dollar for dollar, I think I've absolutely found the best value in a performance luxury sedan.  Is the A6 absolutely perfect?  No.  But what car out there is?  The A6 2.7 offers an ideal meld of performance, luxury and general roadability.  I ordered the sport package which came with aggressive 225 45R Y 17 Brigestone Pozenta all weather tires and beautiful 17" BBS alloy wheels.

Let me tell you.  This car, with its all wheel drive, Electronic Stabilization Program and low profile 17" tires holds the road almost magnetically. Everything I've heard about the Quattro system is true.  In addition, the Triptronic transmission allows you to downshift coming into the turns so as to slow the car without going heavy on the brakes - if you brake at all.  My first real road test was a 125 mile run up California's coast HWY 1 and back.  This car handled the S-turns flawlessly at speed.  The tires hardly ever screeched.

Everything about the A6 2.7T is outstanding.  The standard stereo is awesome, safety features are world class in fact, the whole damn car is world class.  There are however, a few minor ergonomic issues that I think Audi should have already addressed.  Hopefully they will in their next model year.  

While researching this purchase, I drove the BMW 5401 & 528i and Lexus 430.  All great cars, but didn't offer the combination of performance, creature comforts and over-all value of the A6 2.7T.  Also, the professional reviewers at Car and Driver rated the A6 2.7 & 4.2 higher than the BMW 5 series.  (And besides, "Bimmers" are everywhere and have become rather Cliche.) 

So after test driving the A6 2.7T, I was sold.  I ordered the option packages I wanted and waited just over 3 months for delivery.  I get a lot of positive comments about the car's appearance and quite a few drivers check it out when I'm driving around.

A well rounded performance sport sedan that will not disappoint.

40,000 Mile Update: "Who Needs SUV's?"

Since I wrote my original review, I've put 39,400 additional miles on my A6 Quattro.  I've had all the scheduled service performed at a cost of $Zero Dollars and Zero Cents, and I like the car more today than I did when it was brand new.

Previous to the Audi A6, I had been driving Luxo SUV's with manually activated four wheel drive.  And let me count the times I needed high ground clearance . . . Zero times.  How many times was I glad that I had the cargo room that the SUV offered?  About 5 times in nearly 6 years of driving the SUV.

As for the real world and the Audi A6 -- 4 people, with skis (stored internally) luggage and goddies in the large trunk, all wheel drive with decent snow tires and the car handles like a friggen slot car.  No worries about roll-overs, in a car that's designed for Autoban driving.  How many times have you seen an SUV with the skis mounted on roof racks?  What happened to all the interior room?

Imagine 2 people for a week of skiing, skis stored securely inside the locked car along with luggage out of sight in the trunk.  Driving a quick and agile performance sedan with absolutely no worries about making it through the snow.  You talk about self contained and ready for anything?

In fact, on a recent ski trip, we basically saw two types of vehicles in the mountains.  Out-of-towners driving SUV's, and area locals driving Audi's.  

So, next time you think you've just got to have an SUV, think about the driving safety, agility and pleasure you will sacrifice.  

Give an Audi Quattro a test drive and find out what Audi drivers have known for years -- Big, clumsy, SUV's are completely unnecessary for about 75% of the people who own them.
