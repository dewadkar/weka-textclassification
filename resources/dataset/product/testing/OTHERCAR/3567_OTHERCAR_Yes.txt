            It's not so much to take a few shots, save them and later upload them to your website so friends can see them. With this camera, you will go beyond the simple pleasures of e-mailing the kids' recent vacation trips to the ocean, river and amusement parks to grandparents.  Equipped with this new Canon PowereShot G2 will make you get out and start seeing your environment with new eyes.  <i>For sure, <b>Canon PowerShot G2</b> is the best top quality camera on the market these days</i>.  I have been looking for a decent digital camera recently.  Being as frugal as I can be, obviously price would be taken into consideration.  Canon PowerShot G2 was way too much for my budget, but I managed to hang out with a photographer friend of mine to see what the hype is all about.  Well, I will take this back. There can't be any hype with this Canon when it has a resolution of more than 3 MP and CCD, a feature that you can find in most Canon's earlier models. 

<b>Hobbyists, professional and advanced amateur photographers Should Go For This!</b>

If you are serious about your profession, you will want to have the best possible tools.  And if you care about the type of picture output you obtain, you will invest in this camera that provides you with a great picture quality, high resoolution, top performance and reliability.  It all depends on what you are going to use this camera for.  If you want to use it to take pictures to upload to your website, then you know that you way too much MP.  After all, the true value of the camera resides in the number of mega-pixels and how you can maneuver to get what you want.  That's why the most obvious consideration when buying a digital camera is choosing a model with the amount of megapixels you want for the type of job you want to perform. Often megapixels aren't the best gauge of the quality you'll be getting. The fewer the megapixels, the less data you'll have to work with and the less you can do with your pictures. Big numbers of pixels equate to photo-quality prints, where smaller numbers of pixels mean low-quality images best suited for the Web. 

<b>Keep in mind that the quality of your pictures must not suffer!</b>

While searching for my camera, I knew that I had to have something between 2.5 and 3 MP.  Then, Lo and behold Canon brings this new camera to the market.  In my consultation with my friend, I realized that this amount of mega-pixels would produce very sharp images that I can use for all purpose.  In fact, he was trying to get me to go half and half with him.  I declined the offer.  He had to get his own camera for his work.  To me, a camera is like an undergarment.  There was no way I was going to share it.  I can show somebody how great my camera, but I would not feel comfortable knowing that it is not in my house to access it when I want to.  Any way, he got his own.  He will make a good return on it through his studio.

<b>Is it worth the investment?</b>

It's the best digital camera you can get on the market at this time.  Obviously, if the price raises some concerns for you, you can always wait until it comes down.  In the meantime, you can imagine how many great photo opportunities you will have lost.  This point&shoot camera  comes with USB port capability and 3x optical zoom.  This is where it's important for you to remember that optics and image quality (a factor of the MP amount) are very important to the enjoyment of the camera.

Canon wants to give cutting-edge technology to travel with and run your business.  If you can handle luxury, then you will appreciate this exciting, new Canon PowerShot G2.
