            I lose about 60-70% of all shots with this one.  They either turn out really dark, or are just too bright to see any detail.  I've seen kids cameras generate more consistant than this one.  Once in a great while you will take a shot and it will come out good, the rest of the time it is either too dark, too bright, or just comes out as a black screen.  I have experiemented with it to see if I could consistantly get the same results based upon lighting, distance, and time taken between shots.  This one just is not anything you can use a formula to apply to any operational procedure to get decent photo's..  The flash is overbearing, I wish they would have just ommitted it since it destroys what ever picture you are taking.

This camera is a nice paperweight, and the companies support doesn't exist,  their answer to everything is "I don't know"  save you money and buy a barby cam or something if you want to go on the cheap end with a digital camera.
