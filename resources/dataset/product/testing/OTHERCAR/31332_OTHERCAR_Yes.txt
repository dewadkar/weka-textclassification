             I bought my New yorker in 2001 so it was already seven years old at the time. I paid $6,000.00 for it. With a family that was growing I needed a larger car. I had a Skyhawk before this. But that was just getting to small for my family.

 When I bought the car I was guaranteed it would pass inspection. Thankfully I got that because it failed for two things. One being the emergency brake pad missing, which is a minor thing. The other thing it failed for was the third brake light was out. When I took it back to the dealer I bought it from they had to get me a rental car because it was such a big job. They actually had to remove the back seat and the back window just to get to this light. If it wasn't covered I don't even want to guess what I would have been charged for this repair!

 Also when I bought the car the driver's seat was broken. so they had to replace that before I would buy it. Considering the age of the car I thought this was uncommon since it is not that old. It works fine now. 

  A little after I bought it the hydraulics for the hood went. So you need something to prop it up. I heard these are expensive to replace so I have not gotten around to this.

 The stereo had a beautiful sound. Unfortunately recently I started to have problems. First the lights went out. I checked a fuse, but that was not it. So I had no idea what station  was on, what track the CD was on or the time. Than right after that the radio stopped working. Than the power antenna stopped functioning. So now all I can do is listen to CDs, but having no idea which track. I will get around to it.

  But I just had to replace the battery ($100.00) and the tires and tie rods ($900.00). Now I have been told that the sway bar is messed up. You can feel it and hear the squeaks now when you drive. I am not certain on the cost of this as I just found out about this.

 I do like the traction control on the car. We had a rough winter here in New Jersey and it really came in handy. Once you hit a wet spot from the rain or the slickness from snow it clicks right on. Keeps the car going nice and straight.
 
 So overall I would have to rate this car average. It is a very comfortable car with plenty of room. It will fit 3 adults in the back and two in front comfortably with plenty of room. Plus it has a huge trunk. It has a nice shape and style to it. It has a nice pick up and gets good mileage for it's size. I get a little over 20 miles per gallon. It runs great when it is at top performance.

  But it does need quite a few repairs. As I was told by a mechanic Chrysler repairs are very expensive. But it is almost 10 years old now.

 So if you don't mind spending the money on repairs for the comfort and style than this may be the car for you.
