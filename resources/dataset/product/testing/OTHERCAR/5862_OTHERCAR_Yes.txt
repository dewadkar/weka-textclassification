            I initially wrote this review for the 2000 TL model, however, Acura has changed nothing from the previous year, so this review also covers the 2001 model TL.  

When I went looking for a new car to replace my aging '93 maxima, I first thought about getting the 2000 model maxima. However, I found that not only can you get the TL for almost the same price, you can actually get it for less money then a maxima. That, combined with the Acura reliability and its amazing handling sold me.
The TL comes fully loaded, having only two options - 6 disc cd changer and Navigation system. Aside from these two options the car has everything you would want in a car. Luxurious interior, beautiful exterior and a surprising amount of power. The only pet peeve I have with this car is the absence of memory seats. But if that is the biggest problem one has with a car, it has to be one great car.
The car is great for regular relaxed driving while listening to the great sound system with a built-in subwoofer in the rear, but is much more fun for the more aggressive drivers. It handles beautifully, and takes sharp turns without problems. You will never find yourself thinking that it needs more power, and if you use the manual shift option, and downshift to pick up speed faster, its almost like driving a manual. The pick up is amazing. In auto comparisons it beat out the Lexus ES300 and the Infinity I30 in almost every category, with those two being the closest competition and costing well over three thousand more. The car is also great on long trips and you will not find yourself getting tired after hours of sitting in it.
The only people who should not buy this car are those who can afford to buy a BMW M5. This car is a tremendous value and if you are looking to purchase a new car that is both sporty and luxurious this is the way to go. I have not spoken to a single person who did not love driving this car and I get complemented by most people who set foot inside.
