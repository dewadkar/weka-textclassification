            I have driven all of the major American made sports cars.  The Vette by far beats out the Mustang Cobra and the Viper.  The Corvette has one of the most powerful engines I can ever imagine in a sports car and it never gives up.  The engine will fully accelerate at any speed your at.  It picks up from 0-60 in on time and once your past there it keeps goin up at the same pace.  I drove the Viper a few months ago and did prove to be one of the best modern muscle cars out there but it could not compare to the stylish design of the interior and exterior of the Vette.  The Vette had more than just looks on top of the Viper, it had better acceleration and speed.  If your looking for a great sports car to have a fun time with and are willing to spend some cash the Corvette is the right car for you.<br><br>
