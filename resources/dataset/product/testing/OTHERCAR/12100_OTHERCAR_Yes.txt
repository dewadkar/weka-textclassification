            The Grand Vitara has been a formidable class of vehicles with the Jeep, Honda CR-V and the Toyota RAV4. Suzuki's 5-door Sidekick was to truckish to be a contender also with the Honda CR-V. The Vitara comes in 3 or 5 door configurations and use 4-cylinder engines. But the Grand Vitara it can come in 2 wheel drive or 4 wheel drive and has greater off road control, comfortable cruising and a V-6 engine.

The engine has a double overhead can and 4 valves per a cylinder. The engineers also replaced the belts with cam chains so that they will hardly need replacing and take up less space. In 2 wheel drive mode the rear wheels are driven which allows for fun time power slides unlike the Honda CR-V which is driven from the front wheels. I would recommend you to buy this car because it is much cheaper then the Honda and Toyota and it has a V-6 engine which the competition does not<br><br>
