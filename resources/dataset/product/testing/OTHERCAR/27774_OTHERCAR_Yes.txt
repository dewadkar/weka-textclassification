            Firstly, let me say out front that I am a novice at digital camera technology, so this is from the prospective of a <i>beginner.</i>  If you are an advanced user, what follows will seem like baby talk.

<b>Doing the Research</b>

When scrutinizing the market for my first digital camera, I checked out all websites I could find which explained dcs clearly and simply.  Two of the best I found were www.dpreview.com and www.dcresource.com/reviews. I already had a Sony video camera, (DCR-TRV/310), which was working well for me in the moving images category, but I wasn�t totally pleased with the digital stills it took, nor the hassle involved in taking digital stills and importing them onto my computer using Studio DV software.  I�m quite pleased with both the Sony video camera and the Studio DV software.  They just didn�t work for me due to the bulkiness of the video camera, the complicated system to import images and  the quality of images.

<b>Pinning It Down</b>

I wanted a dc that wasn�t going to require a bank loan, that was portable enough to encourage me to take it along and that produced decent quality filmless images.

Admittedly I was initially impressed with the compactness and 'cuteness' of the Canon Elph. I honestly couldn�t believe that a dc that small could produce a decent final product.  Then I went to Steve�s Digital Camera Review site, (first one above).  Steve liked it!  He analyzed every part of it.  He explained the Elph in detail.  I bought it on ebay shortly after.  

<b>Assessing the Product</b>

I bought a package, which included an extra 32 mb card for storing more pictures, a must for this camera!  My research had told me that.  The 8 mb card it comes with is simply not enough memory.  Having at least an additional 32 mb cf card will increase your photo storage space from 12, (fine/large  1600 x 1200 pixels), to 52.  It was easy to set up the camera for use. I liked the rechargeable battery setup.  It too is compact and efficient, the main theme of this dc. Plop the rechargeable battery into its case, pull out the prongs, and put prongs into electrical socket. I charged up the battery and away I went

After capturing some images, I thought, �Oh, no, now the complications are going to kick in, I have to install the photo software.�  The two cds it came with, Canon Digital Camera Solution and Adobe PhotoDeluxe, installed quite easily.  After attaching the USB connection attached to my pc with the Elph in replay mode, up popped the screen and I clicked to transfer my images. What I saw pleased me.  Crisp images which downloaded quickly and which could be emailed to my friends in Australia and California.  Now they are jealous and want to buy one.  The images downloaded hassle free to them and they report great quality. 

<b>Maybe Not for You</b>

Some of the issues I have with this camera are insignificant to me compared to the positive features.  Maybe they are not insignificant to you. Here they are. This is not for the large of hand person!  It is a petite camera, as it states.  If you are not nimble of finger, then I don�t think this is the dc for you.  The zoom feature is limited.  If you think you are going to be taking many photos requiring stronger zoom then avoid the Elph.  You immediately need to buy a bigger cf card than the one it comes with.  This bumps up the price.  When you see it listed as the Elph package, know you are going to add the cost of a larger cf card, (at least a 32 mb card, costing from about $90 US + at most recent checking)

I am on a learning curve to master all the features of this camera.  But, due to its ease of use and compactness, I am looking forward to learning.  

The price quoted below is from an ebay auction which had a 32 mb cf card included along with the kit's 8 mb cf card.
