            <b>Introduction</b>
Some people wonder why anyone would want a V6 Camaro.  There are plenty of reasons, which I'll try to outline in this article.  I'll also explain why you should get a 96 instead of a lesser year.

<b>Why 96 is best for teenagers</b>
In 1995 the Camaro has a 3.4 liter fuel injected engine.  For this small of an engine, 160 hp was a pretty good amount to be put to the ground.  The average price I found for a 95 or 94 fully loaded was $7,500.  In 1996 Chevrolet put a 3.8 liter fuel injected engine in the car, which puts an astounding 210 hp to the ground.  That�s 4 more horses than the 1999 Mustang V6 has.  The average price for a fully loaded 96 is $8,000.

So, for almost the same price, you'll get a lot more ponies, and the car is a lot newer.

<b>Transmissions</b>
With the five speed transmission, you can expect 30 mpg or more.  With the automatic, this number drops to 25.  If you wanted bad gas mileage, you would have gotten a V8 right?

I highly recommend you get the 5 speed in the V6.

<b>Why a V6?</b>
Not only is insurance a lot lower than the V8.  It is still fast, gets great gas mileage, will turn just as well, and has the same styling for a lower price.

<b>Pros</b>
First of all, some people will disagree with me, but the V6 is very powerful.  0-60 is 7.4 seconds.  For those of you who know cars, this is as good as a 1990 454SS.  The quarter mile is 15.7 seconds.  The 1999 Mustang can't even dream of these numbers.  The Mustang is 8.6 seconds 0-60 and 16.5 seconds 1/4 mile.

I stood on the gas from a stoplight without dropping the clutch and I left a fair amount of rubber on the ground.  Probably about fifteen feet of tire slip.  Surprising for most V6's.

This car is gorgeous, Chevrolet knew what they were doing when they designed the exterior.  Not only is it pleasing to the eye, it also keeps wind noise down very well too.

I test drove three cars, two coupes and a T-top.  The Coupes were dead quiet in the interior.  Even with the T-tops off, me and my father could talk in normal tone on the Freeway at 85 mph.  Not only do the T-Tops look gorgeous, but they also make for an almost convertible look, and you can still put a roll bar on the inside(which I planned to do).  The T-Tops are easy to remove/install and fit snugly in the trunk.

The comfort is amazing.  I loved everyone of the 1994-1996 Camaro's I test drove, I was really comfortable.

This car has both a hatch back and a trunk.  This makes for a lot more room than I was expecting.  You release the trunk in the glove box.

The seatbelts were in just the right position, it was no problem to reach for them and put them on.

When shifting, you can rest your right arm on the arm rest, which makes for a very sporty feel.

I loved the way the gauges were laid out.  The Tachometer was the dominant gauge, and redlined at 6,000 rpms.  The speedo went to 110 miles per hour, I think the car is probably governed there.

Handling is what this car does best.  It is glued to the road, swerves and high speed turns are a blast, since there is no body roll and you are always in control.

The gas mileage is one reason I really liked these cars, easily pulling down 30 or better with the 5-speed transmission.

There is a ton of room in the engine bay, this is because a V8 is usually found in there.  Everything maintenance related looked very easy.

The rearview mirror has some fancy electronic stuff that cancels out headlights at night so they don't really hurt your eyes.  You can still see them, just not an overly obnoxious light.

<b>Neutral</b>
Camaro's are best described with the attitude, &quot;Fall in, Climb out.&quot;  This summarizes it perfectly.  The first few times I got in and out, it was awkward, but I soon(5 times) got used to it and it wasn't that big of a deal.

In the '94 I test drove, the clutch was tight, the shifter was hard to shift, and the throw was incredibly long for a sports car.  In the '96 the clutch was light, the shifter was smooth, and the throw as fairly short, still long for a sports car.

The stereo is OK, nothing to brag about, I was planning on changing it first.

The '96 I test drove had the Rally Sport package, which is a ground effects package.  It looks beautiful but in my short test drive(15 miles), I scraped it two times on the pavement.  I would definitely opt for a base Camaro without the ground effects because they are too much hassle.

Rear seat room wasn't nearly as bad as I was expecting.  It isn't a Cadillac, but there is enough room that an average sized male should be able to fit no problem.  There isn't any room to move your feet around, so long rides would get annoying.  The rear seat was raised in the center so you'll have only two rear seats.

Insurance is high($1,100 a year for an 18 year old), but not as high as a '95 S-10 pickup($1,200 a year for an 18 year old).

The doors are a little long, so be careful in parking lots.

<b>Cons</b>
What�s a con?  All right, I'll name some minor nuisances.

I'll have to say the nose slopes away from the driver so you can't see the end.  This is why a lot of people put bras on the front with flaps sticking up, so they can tell where the end of this long nose is.

Looking out the drivers side mirror, you get a nice view of the elegant curves of your car.  There isn't much to be seen out of this side of the car, especially if you try to look over your shoulder.  If you lean forward, the view gets better.

The headlights put out less than adequate light on low beam.  I think an aftermarket headlight setup could fix this.

Because you are so low, the headlights of SUV's hits you square in the eyes.

With a V6, there are very few performance mods you can make that will actually make the car go faster.  I was planning on beefing up the suspension, and possibly running a 100 shot of Nitrous into it, but other than that, there are no performance mods worth doing.  If you want real speed, get a V8 version.

<b>Overall</b>
So why aren't I getting one?  Because I want a DeLorean.  I am still searching, my mother wants me to get the Camaro, so I made a deal that if I haven't found the DMC-12 of my dreams within my price range by the 15th of July, I'll get a Camaro.

I already have the color scheme I am going to put on it all picked out.

I know I want a DeLorean, but the Camaro is such an awesome car, I can't decide which would be better for me, I guess I'll have to find out if I can find the DeLorean.

I recommend the V6 Camaro to High School and College students.  It is slow enough you won't do anything overly stupid, and fast enough you can still have some fun.  It would not fit family's, and people who know what a sports car should be will be disappointed.<br><br>
