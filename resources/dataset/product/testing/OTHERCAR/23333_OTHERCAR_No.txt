            I went to a dealership and asked to see one of the prowlers.  The dealer was not so exited.  Why? Because I was another &quot;family no-fun person.&quot;  The dealer knew I wanted to test drive it.  He said:&quot;Yeah sure mister, you can test drive....After you buy it..haha.&quot;  He got quite a laugh but he was the only one laughing.  I got inside and looked around, it was tiny.  The windshield was high and small.  It was like a rectangular porthole in a ship.  The windshield start at about my shoulders and was on an amazing slant.  The side doors were the same, high and odd looking.  The worst part was the trunk.  I asked the dealer to open it and he said: &quot;Oh yeah, forgot to tell you that the trunk space can only fit about a small briefcase or a few papers.&quot;  OK, that's a turn off.  I was flat with a little indent.  I shuddered and walked to the front.  The front wheel design is cool.  It's like an old roadster, like a le mans car or something.  The wheels stick out of the car and are attached by a few well placed bars.  This does not help the handling one bit.  It's not that cool after all.  Looks can be deceving.  The engine is ok but nothing special.  The bottom line is that if you want to get this car, it for looks not the likes.  My advice: get something that will drive well, like a Toyota or a Lexus, they cost about the same and are so much better it's not even funny.<br><br>
