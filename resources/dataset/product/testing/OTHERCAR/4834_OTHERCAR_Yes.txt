            I bought this car because I was driving a Saturn SC2, and that was one noisy car.  I test drove this car and I loved it!  Quiet sure ride that hugs the road, but passes the pavement with great umph! I'm not the usual demographic for this type of car, being only 30 years old, but it has so much for so little I couldn't turn it down!  
The feature I love the most is of course the comfort.  The seats are wonderful, and with the heating elements both in the seat and lumbar portions, it's like therapy!  Who wouldn't want to ride in this car.

This is a big car, so if you like to go to parking garages, don't when driving the LHS.  If you like comfort, power, and class, this is the car for you.

I must say I'm disappointed that this car does not have side impact air bags.  Some road noise, but after driving a saturn for the past five years, it's like a church (the size may ad to that feeling!)
The handling is a little rough around tight corners, but all and all a fantastic car.
