            I always have, and probably always will deem myself a car enthusiast.  For this reason I hope you can take my opinion on the Audi A4 to heart.  I am a true believer in subtle beauty, and by no means does the A4 fall short of this characteristic.  Audi has managed to captivate a younger audience with the addition of the A4 in I believe 96 or 97.  This automobile goes for a reasonable 30-35 thousand dollars yet manages to appear along the likes of Lexus, Volvo, Acura, and BMW.  

My favorite things about the A4 are first and foremost its outer beauty.  The A4 is so elegantly designed that the mere sight of it makes me blush. I feel Audi's intention in creating this card was to make it subtle yet gorgeous.  The interior comes with astoundingly comfortable leather, a semi luxurious dash and a great sound system.  All of this, not to mention the intriguingly quite sound of the engine, and the available Quattro system which provides full time 4WD to the vehicle.  It also carries the tiptronic transmission system, which gives the driver the ability to shift from a automatic transmission, to a clutch free manual trans.  Best of all the Audi is fairly reasonably priced, it appeals to people from the ages of 19-40.  This automobile was very well done, and production has been flawless.  

The one area that I didn't like when test driving the automobile, was the fact that the steering wheel was so low to my legs.  This is probably because I was driving the sport version which comes equipped with a three spoke racing wheel.  Overall I love this car, and would recommend it to anyone.
