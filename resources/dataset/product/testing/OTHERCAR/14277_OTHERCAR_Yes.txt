Chevrolet Suburban has been there ever since 1935 with the introduction of the Chevy Suburban Carryall. This year, Chevrolet came out with the best Suburban yet. We ordered our 2000 Chevy LT K1500 Suburban last winter without even seeing the new body style. We love it! 

It rides like a dream as a result of the Vortex V8, the most powerful engine in it's class. It's great knowing that you have the power to accelerate very quickly and the comfort of a luxury SUV.It's a great family car. I have three brothers. With seating for up to 8 people and more hip and leg room than ever before, you can understand why we would want to own a new Suburban. 

Another reason is that we had previously owned three Suburbans and loved them. We thought that there couldn't be anything better, but we were wrong. This year's Suburban is truly the best one yet. 

When you first see it, the first thing that you notice is the newer, sleeker, more stylish body style. There's no other SUV on the road like it today! 

The outside isn't the only thing that's changed for the better. Don't believe me, just step inside and see for yourself. The first thing that you will probably notice is the huge, luxurious leather front driver-side and front passenger- side seats. 

The seat warmers and molders on these seats are to provide for absolute comfort.Do you want to enjoy the nice day outside? No problem,for the first time in history Chevrolet is offering a moon roof option on their LTs. 

Turn on the radio and you will notice the nine speaker, surround sound audio system that is much better than most home entertainment systems. You will also notice the radio in the second seat. 

This is for the rear passenger's convenience They can listen to their separate radio station while the front passengers listen to their radio station. 

We all loved the 92-99 Suburbans, but I guarantee you that you will love this one more. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone who has a huge family, needs big towing capacity (will 10,500 lbs. do the trick?) 

Do you live in a climate where bad weather often pops up on surprise? If so, then the Suburban is the SUV for you with it's automatic 4x4 kick in. This feature comes with the 4x4 models only. 

You also of course have the 18 feet in length and 6.5 feet wide for hauling. I do have to admit that it does look shorter, but actually is the exact same size. The cargo space of the new Suburban is huge! Do you remember those hot afternoons hauling tables and having to take out the third seat and go through all of that fuss?

Well, Chevy has fixed the seat problem by putting a new &quot;fold and stow away&quot; feature in all of their new Suburbans. This way, the seat doesn't need to come out. 

You can just leave it in and it doesn't get in the way. If for any reason you NEED to take the third seat out,Chevy has put wheels on the seat and made it much easier to remove.

Do you ever have air conditioner or heater problems with your 92-99 Suburbans? Well, Chevy has fixed that problem too. The freezing cold air or nice, hot heat comes blowing out of the Suburban's air conditioning vents. 

Chevy has also added a lot of security options and standards to the LT. First of all, whenever you go over fifteen miles per hour, the doors automatically lock. This way whether you are going out to conquer the world or just going to the grocery store around the corner, you will feel very safe and secure. 

Another safety option that has been added this year to the LT is the Security System. Let's say that someone is following you to your car, all you have to do is press the panic button on your keyless entree key pad, then the alarm will automatically sound and scare the person away. 

The alarm also sounds if someone is trying to break into your vehicle. The doors also automatically lock. If by any chance your car does get stolen, you have the option of On Star. 

What is On Star? On Star is a 24 hour, 7 day a week service that allows their satellites to locate your vehicle within a 10 mile radius. That isn't the only thing that On Star can do. If ever in an accident, an On Star operator will come over the intercom and ask you if everything is all right. 

If there is no answer, they will automatically call the local ambulance services and proper authorities and notify them of the incident. 

That's not all, need plane or hotel reservations? No problem, On Star will make them for you as well as find you tickets to a hard to get to concert or game. 

What about quality The new 2000 Suburban is quality. With it's redesigned frame that's more like a box to prevent all of those rattles and weird other sounds that all previous Suburban owners are well aware of. 

All things about the new Suburban are not good, however. First off, the gas tank is smaller. It does get slightly better gas mileage than the all popular 1992-1999 version. My mom had to fill our previous Suburbans up about once every week. She has to fill the new one up twice a week. 

Another really cool thing that the new 2000 Suburban does is that have you ever had the radio blasting and turned the corner and not realized that your blinker is still on? Another problem solved by Chevy. If this occurs, it makes a sound like an elevater noise to remind you that your blinker is still on. Neat huh? 

All in all, the new 2000 Chevrolet LT Suburban is the ultimate Sport Utility Vehicle. <br><br>
