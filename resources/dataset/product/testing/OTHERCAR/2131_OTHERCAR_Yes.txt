            Your probably thinking to yourself right now &quot;this car is not that sharp looking.&quot;  Let me assure you that this car may not be the most visually beautiful automobile that you'll lay your eyes on, but it is one of the most reliable cars on the market.

Their are so many reasons why someone should purchase this vehicle.  One reason I decided to purchase my 1993 Dodge Spirit is because my grandmother owns a 1990 and it was one of the best purchases she ever made.  In the 10 years she's had the car she has put 60,000 miles on it and not once has had a major problem with the car.  She informed me that the car handles great in all weather conditions, is very reliable and endures through everything.  Personally I have found that the gas mileage is great.  I personally have the 4-cylinder model with a 16 gallon tank.  I have to refuel the car, but once a week even with these high gas prices.  I put in about 10 dollars a week and I still have some gas left over each time I refuel.

I do not have any reasons to dislike this car, except that it doesn't offer too much luxury and the alarm can get quite annoying at times.  One thing that bothered me was the double DIN radio my car came equipped with.  When I went to put in my Sony XPlod CDX4000X which was only a single DIN, so I had to dish out an extra 30 dollars for a conversion kit.  It would take to long to explain all the reasons I love this car so I will just list them:

1.  Gas Mileage
2.  Low Insurance rates
3.  Reliability
4.  Endurance
5.  Great price for such a great car...

There are many more reasons that I love this car, but this being just a quick review of the car.

Driving this car is relatively comfortable considering the size of this automobile.  I am a pretty tall male (at 6'0&quot;) and I am rather comfortable driving this car and I could definitely last a long trip.  The back seat might be a little cramped for some, but it should be reasonable for many adults and all children.  The ride is relatively smooth with not much noise whatsoever.

If anyone should really consider this automobile it would have to be someone not looking for a real sporty sedan.  Otherwise, I would suggest to those people to look into a Honda Accord.  Otherwise if you are a teenager looking for a good first car that will not kill you in insurance or an elderly person looking for a reliable good priced mid-sized sedan than I would definitely recommend the 1993 Dodge Spirit.
