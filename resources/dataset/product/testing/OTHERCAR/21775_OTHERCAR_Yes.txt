            Before I got a car I swore that I would get a Honda, and that after I got mine all my friends would have one as well. Well, that wasn't just wishful thinking, I got my Honda Civic DX in April of 1997, and soon thereafter the four people I told that to had Hondas, 3 of which are Civic coupes. Now when I discuss cars with someone and Hondas come up I say, &quot;It's not just a car, it's a family...&quot;
Back to the review. Before I had a Honda, I knew I wanted one, because I saw the way my Father's 1984 Accord had seen it all and never gave up. That poor little car has well over 200,000 and keeps chugging along, even an American car lover has to respect the rugged reliability a Honda can produce. My Civic is no different, I take better care of it then my Dad does his Accord, but it's just as tough as its predecessor. 
Anyway, the Civic is an economical choice in many senses, it's a low priced car (but not a cheap piece of crap), it's very maintenance free (except for regular maintenance), and being as though Japan is the only nation to experience a Nuclear blast, I bet that a Honda could survive Fallout!! <br><br>
