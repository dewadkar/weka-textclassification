            My wife and I had been looking for a good digital camera, and we went to a long time family camera shop where we had made several purchases over the years.  We looked at the Sony cameras, and were turned off by the memory stick format.  The salesman showed us the Nikon Coolpix 775, and we immediately loved it.  

The size was very compact, and the camera itself only weighed 6.5 ounces with the battery in it.  It was sold as a "kit" with an 8MB memory card, a rechargeable battery (about an hours worth), the charging base, a/c adapter for charging base, strap and USB cables.  I didn't need to purchase anything else but a small carrying case for this camera.  The resolution is at 2.1 megapixels, and you can shoot in 3 different "resolutions".  The image quality on the finest setting was incredible.  I could not believe how much detail this digital camera could capture in a shot, but it really exceeded my expectations.  

The focus is always good, and the color quality is very hard to mess up!  I usually leave it on the auto settings, but you can adjust every feature manually if you like.  Your aperature, color balances, speeds, etc...  Very versatile for someone who knows what they're doing manually, but simple and unbeatable for the novice.  the software comes with a great feature to upload your images to your PC.  It's basically just a one button upload feature.  That's it!  The camera is also native USB, so your uploads are fast, and erasing the memory card is quick and simple.  I've read the earlier reviews on the 700 model, and the 775 has a lot of the requested updates.  For instance, it includes a 3x optical zoom, as well as a digital zoom, it has a rechargeable battery pack, not AA's, The camera has a dial adjustment for several types of shooting situations to maximize the outcome of the shot, it has features like "Best Shot Selection" which will take several shots of the same image, digitally compare them for focus and quality, and then save the best one of the lot, etc...  The only thing I can see wrong with it really might not even be Nikons doing, but whoever makes the actual LCD screen, didn't account for easy viewing if you want to take a "verticle" shot.  It's almost like it's polarized or something, and it messes with your eyes in that position.  I'm not sure if any others do that as well, but that's the only flaw I found with this unit. 

Nikon has really make a great product here, and being a 35mm Nikon owner for several years (12 I think), I have to say that they put as much thought and effort into this camera as anything they have ever produced.  It's well worth the money, and you just won't find a better line of cameras for the price.
