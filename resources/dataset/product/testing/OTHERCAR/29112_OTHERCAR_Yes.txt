            I purchased my '99 Tacoma, used, in May of 2001.  It's outfitted with the 2.7 liter 4-cylinder, is 4 wheel drive, and has the TRD off-road package.

Let me say this, I am a farm boy who craves power.  All my vehicles before this have been full size trucks with big V8's and 4 wheel drive.  I previously had a '97 S10 with the ZR2 package and traded it in with 114,000 miles on it.

First of all, let me Chevy bash.  The S10 was going to be the truck I drove until it rusted out.  I did routine maintenance on it and took care of it like it was a wife.  In the time I had it, I had to replace the transmission ($1200), would have replaced the wiper/blinker assembly($200), all the front bearings ($700), the remote oil filter hoses ($500), and no telling what else if I had kept it.  The truck no doubt had power with the 4.3 liter V6, but it's hard to move a truck that won't shift.  The transmission guy told me that these S10 trucks/Blazers had transmissions that weren't built for the power of the engine.  

After taking immaculate care of this truck, I traded it in for $5000, which is what remained on my loan!  (A friend of mine had a '91 Toyota 4x4 with 150,000 and received $7000).  I walked away with my Tacoma and a smile on my face, though my wallet did hurt from the loss.

I use the truck for everything.  I have had the bed loaded with wood, a 16 foot utility trailer filled with wood, and it walked out of a muddy stretch of hill that is on the back of our farm.  It TOTALLY amazed me!!!  The horsepower is rated at 150, but when you combine 4 wheel drive with the torque of this little engine, the results have impressed me continually.  I thought I would need to get the tractor to pull me out.  

Two weeks after I purchased the Tacoma I went on a trip out West with my wife and put 8000 miles on it.  We used it to cross the dirt and rock roads of WY, MT, WA, and Oregon.  On the highway I even managed to get 26 miles a gallon. (Yeah, I even had to check my math on that one).  The only thing that I have done to it so far is put in a CB, and a K&N drop-in air filter. 

I never in my life thought I would not buy a Toyota, or any foreign vehicle, but there is nothing negative that I can find to say about it.

I do all my own maintenance so I know my truck inside and out.  While rotating the tires, I tightened the wheel lugs and one broke off.  I have heard that some are faulty.  I do wish my truck had a clock in it and the V6, but as I stated before the 4 banger is a torque monster and powerful.  The seats seem a little firm, but they work just fine. (I'll just replace them when I wear them out).

As I've mentioned, I am power hungry and maybe will get a diesel full size some day, but it'll have to park next to my Tacoma, I intend to keep it for my kids to drive, (I don't have any yet), or for camping adventures.  The more I drive it, the more I like it, and I will continue to test its limits.  I haven't found any yet.

I have the extended cab version and suggest it for any taller than 5'5".  It very handy to throw all your gear back there.

Buy it, love it, and keep it forever.
