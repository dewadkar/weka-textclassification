            The Chevy Metro sedan is a cousin of the Suzuki Esteem sedan, built in a joint factory in Canada.  Most are destined for rental fleets, but there were some of us who needed a tiny car with good gas mileage that sat four persons.  The Metro sedan is that--but no more than that.

I bought my 99 Metro LSi 4-door sedan in October of 1999.  It was brand new, with 37 miles on the odometer.  It has air conditioning, a 1.3L 4-cylinder engine and a five-speed transmission.  It now has 74,500 miles, and problems have plagued it since the beginning.

The 4-cylinder engine and 5-speed transmission actually are a decent pair for this car, if only one or two people are on-board.  This car struggles to climb hills, and even riding single-passenger, I sometimes have to downshift to fourth for overpasses.  I fitted it with Goodyear Aquatred tires at 30,000 miles.  They helped with the poor cornering, but did nothing for the very tippy feel when going around tight corners.  The brakes are extremely underpowered for this car, fading in seconds, and in only 35,000 miles of commuting from my house in the mountains to work, I had to replace the front pads twice and the front rotors once.

Inside, you have your choice of two passengers up front with legroom, or four passengers with no front or rear legroom.  The seats are marginally adjustable and very uncomfortable.  Rear headroom is minimal.  The plastic flashing around the seats broke off, as did a curious plastic piece on the doorsill.  The ratcheting rear seatbelts for easy infant seat installation are a glowing exception to an otherwise drab and cramped interior.  Trunk space is practically nonexistent, and the rear seat folds down to reveal a tunnel that does little to expand overall carrying capacity.  (The fold down mechanism squeaks like mad.)

My Metro had more than its share of problems.  At 34,000 miles, three gears took a holiday, leaving me with second and fourth to get home.  GM rebuilt the transmission under warranty.  At less than 40,000 miles, one of the front CV joints came apart in its boot.  Fortunately I had an aftermarket extended warranty, as the dealership wanted $550 just for the part.  At 60,000 miles, the metal exhaust manifold shield developed a crack, causing the whole engine compartment to buzz at just the right RPM.  Now, at 74,000 miles, both CV joints let loose inside their intact boots.  

For the money I paid, there are many better options out there.  Kia, Hyundai, Daewoo, Mazda and Toyota all now make cars that rival the price level of this car, and couldn't possibly have worse build quality.  At the very least, the 100,000 mile warranty that Kia and Hyundai offer would offset the nearly $1,000 aftermarket warranty I bought with this car.

UPDATE 5/30/02:  I now have 94,500 miles on this car.  I'm driving it as little as possible since the aftermarket warranty expires at 100,000.  The CV joints were replaced AGAIN at 89,000, and I hear noise from one indicating it may have let go again.  Also, the transmission started crunching into every gear.  The rebuild cost the aftermarket warranty company $3,500, and cost me almost $800 in rental fees and clutch parts.  The car still has starting problems, after several attempts to get it fixed.  The struts are rattling in their mounts, and I had to recharge the air conditioning.  Needless to say, this will be traded in the moment it hits 100,000 miles.
