              Considering the domestic small cars in the same price range, this car is great.  Compared to the Dodge Neon and Chevy Prism, this is a luxury car.  Kia, new in the car game, has been making Sephia's since about '96 and they have improved.
  I had a 98' and had no problems with the car, until it was unfortunatley stolen and torched.  
  As with many new cars, it has some bugs. For instance, the engine light came on every once in a while for no reason, but I was happy with the car, and like the new one as well.  
   The best feature about this car besides its pep, is the warranty package:  10 yr--10,000 miles powertrain...and 5 year unlimited.  See if Dodge will do that with the Neon...for around $10,000.
