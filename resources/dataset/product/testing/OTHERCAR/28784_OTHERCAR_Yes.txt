            PROS: 
Manual settings, Carl Zeiss lens, MPEG movie mode (you can play it at almost any PC since the player is built-in with Windows OS), the InfoLithium battery. Memory Stick is now priced as much as the other formats. MPEG-EX is an excellent idea for a digital camera.

CONS:
Bundled software. Sony does not offer a camera bag for the DSCS75 with the lens adapter and any filter in place. Also the limited capacity of the memory stick is far less than the 256MB available in other formats. Unavailable TWAIN capability. That is, user has to manually "drag" the photos from the memory stick folders to the PC's hard drive. Too small a screen, even smaller that those found on the Mavica. 90-day warranty is very short compared to competitors.


The Sony DSCS75 is an excellent camera with all the 
features that a typical camera owner would need. Controls are intuitive and easy to use. The Carl Zeiss lens produces vivid photographs all the time. The memory stick is very versatile and has a high capacity. The MPEG movie feature is one of the reasons I got this camera. With Windows ME, I can put snippets together to create a movie. Unfortunately, the 8mb one that's included with the camera is almost useless. Sony should put a disclaimer right in the box that says the 8MB memory stick included with the camera will not provide sufficient storage for optimum quality photos. 

The grip was also excellent. I specifically like the manual settings. This gives me more flexibility in taking pictures. From bright, sunny conditions, to the lights at night. The macro setting, while limited, is also a very handy feature of the camera. The adjustable flash level also comes very handy. The MPEG-EX allows me to take long videos. Being able to resize, enlarge, rotate, magnify, or delete photos on the spot is a very handy feature. I specifically like the thumbnail feature that allows you to modify (delete or change) any or all photos at once.

Aside from purchasing the 128 MB memory stick, I have to purchase a new software to handle/process my photos. The MGI Photosuite that came with the Sony has had troubles from loading multiple photos, to changing the drive/photo location, to even just starting. Complaining about this problem with the software, the kind customer support representative referred me to the software vendor, Roxio. After waiting for about 45 minutes on hold at Roxio, I decided to give up and not use the software at all.

I just wish Sony puts in a bigger screen. The pictures are hard to see in the small screen.

Weight is about right.

Price paid: $499+$10 s/h, March 31, 2002 price, with US warranty at JandR.com


BottomLine:
Other than the faulty MGI PhotoSuite software and Roxio's poor customer service, my experience with the DSCS75 has always been a pleasant one. While I purchased this product because Sony lasts for a long time, the 90-day warranty is not long enough to cover equipment this expensive.
