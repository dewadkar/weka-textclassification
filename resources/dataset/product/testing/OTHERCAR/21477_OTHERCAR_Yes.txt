            My husband has always owned sports cars - Firebird, Trans Am G.T.A., etc..., but when we had our first child - they had to go.  Most sport cars are too small for children in the back seat and don't have the safety features that your average minivan would.  For a year and a half we owned a minivan and an oldsmobile Cutlass(both highly rated for child transport).  My husband was always disappointed though because he missed a vehicle with power and a sporty look......in comes the Grand Prix SE (4 door of course).

This car has a sleek sporty design - EXCELLENT handling ability and POWER (as of course compared to our minivan).  This beautiful car cured my husband's urge for the sport car and also has enough room for me and the now two kiddies.  It also has child proof locks and other child features that most sporty cars don't.  

My husband loves his car and it makes him feel younger and not so much like a family man, but a man.  I know this sounds ridiculous, but if you can fulfill both needs through one means then I am all for it.  Also, I love the way the car handles, the features (moon roof, cd, power everything - and off course the pick up).

I would recommend this car to anyone that has a family and wants a more sporty car for themselves that can also be used with the kids.

My only complaint is the headlight assemblies keep falling off (which after reading these reports I see is typical of this year, make and model)

We own a 1997 Pontiac Grand Prix SE 4 door and love it!<br><br>
