            There's a suspicion among consumers that automobiles aren't made to last 5 years.  In fact, many people celebrate if they're lucky enough for their vehicle to turn over 100,000 miles.

At 17 and the recently anointed head of the household, I was lucky enough to know enough to do some research on cars and have a friend of the family selling for a trusted dealership.  The family's Chevy station wagon was on its last legs and the poorly-maintained Buick threw a rod months back.  Not to stir controversy (and plenty of people would argue these points), but our family has always bought domestic and we were lost to Ford after a slew of unacceptable mishaps in the 70's.  It didn't hurt that the friend worked at a Chevy dealership.

We needed a car that was going to give back on its investment with peace of mind, good gas mileage and a moderate sticker price.  Initially I was looking at the lower end, around the Cavalier.  I read a tip that the lowest priced vehicles often are considered &quot;disposable&quot; vehicles, marketed towards the newest consumer and not generally built for maximum longevity.  The advice was to move up one model to find the better car in the line.  This brought us to a decision between the Beretta or Lumina.  Okay, I'm a sucker for a bit of flash, a sportier looking car.  Especially at 17, the salesperson's description of the Lumina of a &quot;family vehicle&quot; may have influenced my decision. (That's something to keep in mind when shopping for a new vehicle: Though the two models weren't much different in price, a good salesperson knows how to steer your decision!)

I test-drove the Beretta GT which included a sport-suspension and flashier rims.  I gave the basic Beretta a drive and wasn't that impressed with the GT's improvements over the baseline model.  Quick figuring showed I could fit a larger engine and better options package in the base model and not buy into what I saw as mild at best improvements in the GT.  I left with a basic red automatic 1990 Beretta with a V6 3.1 liter engine and an options package including a sun roof, air, power windows and locks and an AM-FM/tape deck.

Nine years later and 150,000 miles...she's still on the road!  She's spent most of her time in the Chicagoland and middle IL area, taking us through both city and interstate driving.  Handling in this car has been superb and the 3.1 V6 gives enough punch to move out of trouble when necessary.  I've been very happy with the performance of the Beretta over her 9 years of service with handling, acceleration and braking.  More than once I received a compliment of &quot;nice ride!&quot; from passengers and trunk space is great.

In nine years, I've had plenty of time to run into any persistent problems.  I haven't had one that can be traced back to the original manufacturing of the vehicle.  She has a new refurbed engine in it (I blew a head thanks to a poor tune-up and the mis-handling of a 9 cent pin) and has gone through normal brake work and exhaust/muffler replacement.  I did have some problems thanks to a mechanic not knowing how to properly replace the seat belts that were recalled (replaced free on recall); we had a stint where the driver's window didn't operate properly.  The window is fine, but that door panel has never fit right since.  The interior is showing a bit of wear; the dash has started to turn up near the windshield and the vinyl around the doors is slipping some.  For nine years, I attribute it to normal wear.

I did have one problem with the Beretta and I've known a few others who have witnessed the same problem; the paint flecks easily and at times will degenerate in a circular pattern.  I've heard that this was a problem in the paint used in Chevys for the 89-90 model years; my problem was much less severe than a friend's problem.  Her black 1989 Beretta was turning primer grey in blotches when she got rid of it.

In fairness, she would also present a much different opinion of her Beretta were she included in this review.  Though I don't know particulars with her problems, she cursed that vehicle until she was able to get it off her hands.  I didn't have any of the problems she did and attributed it to the difference in model year (hers was an 89, mine is a 90) and the quality of service she was receiving in her area.

Soon I'll retire the vehicle that has carried me through school, jobs and numerous life experiences.  I haven't checked blue book on it and it may be old enough to not be appreciated as much as it should be, but I can easily say that my Beretta has been the pinnacle of investment in a vehicle that one could hope for, short of never having to maintain, repair and replace an automobile.<br><br>
