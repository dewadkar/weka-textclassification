            I became interested in digital photography while on vacation last April with some friends who owned a Nikon CoolShot. After our return they copied (after a lengthy wait) selected photos to a floppy for me to transfer to my home PC for viewing. I was amazed at the quality of the shots and what I could do with the MGI PhotoSuite II software that I had purchased. I was hopelessly hooked.

The search began with extensive research as to what was available in the marketplace and what kind of hit my wallet was about to take. There were plenty of reviews to help me along the journey, but, frankly, the big hitters all shared favorable comments. Pricing seemed to be relatively comparable as well, feature for feature. I finally chose the Sony FD81 because of the ease of standalone operation, features and image storage on a self-contained floppy disk. The camera was a bit more than I wanted to pay at $899 at the usual mass merchant retail stores. So, off I went to do some serious price shopping on the Net. I finally found an e-commerce house selling the FD81 for $639, which was certainly a pleasant surprise. Prices are now much more diverse, so do your homework on this issue.

The lower price now made the Sony even more desirable, particularly when stacked up with the competition and all the add-ons required to make their systems operational. Additional memory cards were essential if one was using the camera on a heavy shooting venture and/or on an extended stay where the PC was not immediately available. Next came the cables and other assorted things necessary to transfer the data from the camera to the computer, which was essentially the same hassle as using the Sony 8mm camcorder....a real pain in the posterior. A year ago most of the competition nor computer manufacturers offered the features we see today, such as accessories included with the purchase, USB support, larger memory capacity, etc. Also, memory cards were much more expensive at the time.

Now, lets get on with the after-purchase use and evaluation. During the past year I have had the opportunity to try out several of Sony's strong contenders. The FD81 holds its own with any of them. Picture quality is extremely good, albeit a bit &quot;soft&quot; as compared with Nikon and Kodak. That can be easily adjusted with software enhancement, although I seldom find it necessary to do so. Controls are placed in a manner to be efficient and avoid creating a major mishap though inadvertent handling. The viewing screen is clear and bright (adjustable). The FD81 features are numerous: special effects, manual or auto focusing, self-timer, up to one minute of video/audio on a floppy, playback/review/quick edit,  time/date stamp, index screen, quick charge battery, file numbering system, adjustable flash level, quick e-mail/bit map/voice settings, 3X optical zoom, integral disk format/copy...and the list goes on. It would be nice to have a viewfinder for extremely bright days, however.

The fact that the Sony Mavica line has a floppy disk drive makes them unique to all other amateur digital cameras. You can record about 35 - 40 images on a single floppy in normal mode at 640 X 480 resolutions and 20, or so, when the camera is set to fine mode (most photographers will select this higher quality mode). The nest step up gives you much larger pictures at 1024 X 768, but you'll be limited to approximately 6 - 16 pictures on a floppy, depending on which mode you select. The camera will format the floppy for you, if desired. The disk copy feature is really neat. Just finish up loading a floppy with pictures, punch in copy on the menu and it'll read and store the contents and then prompt you for a clean disk and copy the stored material onto the sister floppy. Now, remember my friend's Nikon? Had this been my Mavica I'd have made the copy on the spot and sent him merrily on his way to view the duplicate pictures on his PC without delay. That's a class act, for sure.

Much has been said in reviews about the Mavica's integral flash, mostly negative. However, I've found that the flash is quite effective and accurate. Forget quality in a darker room at ten or more feet from the subject, but that's true for just about any camera with a built-in flash. Critics also complain about the flash being too &quot;hot&quot; when very close up. Well, I've learned that if you manage the camera you'll get excellent results in low ambient light. The key is to allow the FD81 to fully monitor and adjust before pulling the trigger. Too may users don't watch the little lights on the screen that tell you when it's ready to perform as intended. The picker folks can go to the menu and manually set the flash intensity if encountering a very tricky lighting environment.

This has become a rather long review, so I'll close with these final remarks. I have found no use for the audio/video feature. It's a cute gimmick for e-mailing quasi-decent motion pics with sound, if that is important to you. I've also had no need for the higher resolution (1024 X 768) setting. Darn near everything you need in amateur digital photography is amply provided utilizing the fine 640 X 480 mode. That said, if I had it to do over again I'd purchase the FD71/73 with the 10X optical zoom (think about this carefully) and forget the high-rez and audio/video features, which I don't need and pocket about $150 in savings. This, of course, is just a personal preference. Sony provided exactly what I selected. Any second thoughts are purely the result of not performing an adequate personal needs assessment. All-in-all the Sony Mavica FD81 is an excellent investment. It's a quality product with all the bells and whistles. The camera delivers as billed and the price won't make you and the kids go hungry if you just shop around. I'd buy another Mavica in a heartbeat. That's my two cents worth. I hope the review will be of some benefit to the reader(s).
