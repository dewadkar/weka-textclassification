            Moving to Hawaii and being lazy with having film developed in the first place, I decided it was time to purchase my first digital camera. After looking at several different cameras and weighing different options;zoom, features, and price I chose the Pentax Optio 33L. Having no experience with a digital camera in the first place I really didn't know what to expect. I chose well. This camera has everything. The LCD monitor display is 1.5 inches and even turns 180 degrees to enable you take self portraits!  The menu is very easy to navigate through and I was worried about that because the camera is loaded with features. In the regular mode, you can set the camera to various settings depending on the contents and locations of the pictures. For example, there are landscape, sunset, surf and snow, and portrait. Even better yet you CAN tell a difference in the pictures. The filters are also fun. You can take a picture of the beach with a black, white, and blue filter and you would have a black and white photo with the water and the sky blue!  There is also panorama assist, night mode, and you can record up to 30 seconds per frame of video. The only drawback to this camera is here. It does not record audio when filming movies. This may or may not be a big issue for you. It is something I can definitely overlook in a camera. 
There is also a 3X optical zoom. This is not the best on the market but it works well for me, a beginner. The battery life is pretty good and with a 16MB memory chip you can take approximately 65-90 pictures before it fills up (Depending on the recorded pixels and quality of the pictures.) If you are at all worried about the software to install your images onto your computer...don't. I literally put the CD in, clicked a few times and after connecting the USB cable up to the camera and my computer, I was transferring images in no time. It was very easy. The camera itself has several other features making this camera a great value.
