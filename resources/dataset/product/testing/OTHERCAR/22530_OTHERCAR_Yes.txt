            I bought a 1994 Chevy Cavalier in the spring of 1995.  It was a left over from the year before.  Basically a new car.  It was a 4 door which is what I really needed with a new born child in the house.  No more having to reach in the back to put him in or out of the car seat.  

It was a pretty sharp little car.  It ran great, handled very well in the snow,  I don't think I could have asked for a better car.  It was very affordable to run, and to buy.  I got great gas milage with the car.

Over all I think there wasn't anything wrong with that car.  The only thing I really didn't care for was once you started to drive, it automatically locked your doors, and unless you shut the car off,  you had to unlock yourself to get out.  Not a very good feature I must say.  What if for any reason you were in an accident, would you be able to get out easy enough?  I don't think so.  That was the only feature I don't like about it.  Other than that, I give that car a thumbs up.  <br><br>
