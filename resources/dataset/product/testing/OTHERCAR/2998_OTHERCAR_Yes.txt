            I bought this vehicle about 5 months ago for about eight hundred dollars. I was suprised at the shape of this car after being neglected since 1990.   I bought the ES from my Grandfather and it was in shambles.  But I spent a little money to get the beast purring like a kitten.  It is easy to maintain, and parts are readily avalible.   I spent maybe three hundred dollars on it, getting a new bumper, spoiler, grill, and a few other things and now it looks great.  I also used a can of Engine Degreaser to clean it up a bit, and now it is looking good.   This is a great car for younger people because it is mid-sized, gets about 25 miles a gallon, and it can go fast. Insurance isn't as bad ethier. And the hatchback makes it ideal for people who want to fit large objects such as guitars in the back.  I would recommend this car for anyone who wants to have a good American car and wants some to have fun.  It is great to drive and is perfect for teens and college studensts. It is a smooth ride and has a good engine on it. If you take car of it, this car can last a LONG TIME!!!<br><br>
