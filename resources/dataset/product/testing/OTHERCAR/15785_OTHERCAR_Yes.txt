            Most people that are familiar with minivans know that Chrysler is responsible for their popularity.  When they released their minivan in the early 80's people thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread and brought them in record numbers.  Soon after, every auto company followed suit and came out with a minivan of their own.  However, it seems that Chrysler was always one step ahead of the competition, until lately.  However, with the 2001 model year, I believe that Chrysler will position itself right back at the top.

Some things to keep in mind when you are reading this review.  Here are the items that I cannot comment about: safety, how it drives, repairs, mileage.  I can only write about the features of the vehicle.

I was able to see the 2001 Town and Country at the 2000 North American International Auto Show in Detroit.  There are many neat features in the car.  First, Chrysler copied the other companies and added automatic sliding doors.  This allows you to open both side doors from your key chain.  However, they went one step farther and also allow you to open up the back hatch from your key chain.  While these are nice features, they are not necessary though.  What was very nice about these doors where that even though they are not automatic, they are not impossible to open by hand.  If you look at other minivans, like the Windstar by Ford, the doors are very hard to open manually due to the automatic door system.

In addition, Chrysler has added the option of an entertainment center for the rear passengers.  This consists of a TV that fold into the roof of the vehicle.  In between the drive and passenger seat there is a control center that has controls for the TV, a VCR, a Nintendo, and a CD player.  This allows the people in the back to play their own music.

This top of the line model in addition has all the features you would expect.  Leather seats, air, CD player, better speaker system, electric everything, etc.

The body of the car has also changed a little.  It has more of a round shape to it, but overall, it has the same look.  It was very difficult to tell the difference between the 2000 body and the 2001 bod, but if you look closely, you will see the differences.  The 2001 model does look much nicer due to its more round shape.

What is left to see on this car is its safety and how it holds up.  People that own Chrysler vans know that they can have many problems at a very early age.  Hopefully, this vehicle will change that because from what I was able to see, it was very nice.<br><br>
