            I was living in Brooklyn when I decided to buy a new car.  I had researched Saturn and liked what I discovered.  I only wanted to pay about $15,000 and I wanted a new car with a great resale value.  I test drove the SL1 - too basic; the SC1 - nice and sporty, but too small for my needs; and the SL2 - perfect!  

I bought a 1997 SL2 and have had no problems with the car.  I drove it from NYC to LA and it was great.  This car is not a Camry or an Altima.  It's a Saturn.  It is reliable, safe, comfortable, and inexpensive.  The Saturn in the class of these larger cars is the new L series.  

<b>The Dealer</b>
I was very pleased with my experience with my Saturn dealer in Brooklyn and with my new friends at the Saturn in Culver City.  In Boroklyn, my salesperson was a very nice young woman who never tried to pressure you.  She asked questions to determine my needs and then answered all the questions I had for her.  

The dealers in Culver City are very attentive and I have watched as they've worked on my car (checking the breaks and other normal items).  The mechanics answer all my questions and are very professional.  I get the oil changed regularly and take it in whenever I have a concern.  I can usually get an appointment that day or the next to have my car serviced.  While I am waiting, I can have a snack, watch TV or test drive another model.  One salesperson took me out in the new EV car.  It's great.  

<b>The Car</b>
The interior of the SL2 is nice and ergonomically sound.  There are some cabin sounds that can be distracting, but they aren't overwhelming.  The speaker system sounds very nice, especially when you sit in the back seat.  Some passengers think it gets pretty loud.  I replaced the basic stereo with a Pioneer cassette and it sounds great.  

I have the ABS and traction control on my car and it has handled very well when I needed it.  This feature is a little bit more, but I am glad I added it.  This Saturn has been through snow in NYC and crazy rains storms in Texas.  Through all of that, I never worried about losing control.  

The car has a great resale value, especially if you sell it to an individual.  If you try to sell any car to a dealer (as a trade in or otherwise), you're not going to get much for it.  If you take it back to Saturn, you're bound to get a better deal.  Also, my girlfriend bought a Saturn and used her dying Civic as a trade in.  They gave her a very fair price for a car she had to practically push to the dealer.

The Saturn SL2 is a good first car for a student or for a family that is just starting out and concerned about costs, but doesn't want to sacrifice safety.  I would recommend taking a test drive and comparing it to cars in its class, like the Neon (drives like a carboard box on wheels) or the like.  Saturn is a great car and a great experience.  I'm glad I made that choice.<br><br>
