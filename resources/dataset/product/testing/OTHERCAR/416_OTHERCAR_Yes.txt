            We bought a used Lexus ES300 for a great price, only had 40,000 miles on it and was in great shape.  This car is almost too comfortable!!  The leather seats are so supple and the design of the seats is incredible.  When you sit in one of the front seats, recline a little but, you could almost fall asleep....  but that would be dangerous, unless you are a passenger.  This car has a great sunroof with a safety feature (it wont close all the way in one shot, you have to push the button twice in case there is a hand or something else in the way).  There is a 6 CD holder in the trunk and the sound system is wonderful.  The climate control is automatic, you just tell the car what temperature you want, and it keeps the car at the right temperature.  The trunk is huge and holds lots of stuff.  We like to go stock up on food at the wholesale club and we have no problem fitting everything in the trunk.  There is a built in security system of sorts and when you close all the doors you can push a tiny button on the key and all the doors lock and the alarm is activated. The heated front seats are a real luxury in those cold winter months.  WHen driving this car, you cannot hear the motor or any  other outside noises.  If you buy this car I promise you will love it!!<br><br>
