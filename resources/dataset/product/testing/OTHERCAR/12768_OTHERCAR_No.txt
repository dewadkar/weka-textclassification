            My husband and I purchased this car before realizing we were going to be having triplets less than a year later.  So the first problem is that it is way too small, but of course if we had known this car wouldn't have been an option to begin with.  Now we are stuck in a loan for a car that is a nightmare.

I will first tell you what I like about it.  The car is very attractive.  It is a major attention getter (but I don't need that anymore because I get too much attention with the triplets).  It is fast and according to my husband it is a lot of fun to drive.  He says it handles well and hugs the road.  I say at least it is quiet.  I hate cars that make too much noise.  

For reasons I don't care to go into we are still paying on the loan for this car but it has been nothing but trouble from the start.
The first month after having it home it began driving funny and the place we bought it from took a look at it.  We got it back and it was doing fine again.

Three and a half years later we have had this car in the shop more than we have had it on the road.  First it was little things.  There is supposed to be cruise control and controls for the radio on the steering wheel.  The buttons stopped working.  We had them looked at and it was a wiring problem.  They fixed that and then suddenly the radio would change channels or the volume would go up and down without warning.  More wiring problems that had to be taken care of.

There were lots of little problems with the wiring in the car.  Then the driver's side window stopped working.  The door had to be taken off and a new motor placed in the window.  The mirrors are supposed to light up but they don't (and yes I have changed the fuse, that was the first thing the repair guy asked).  The latch on the back right hand seat that is there to catch and keep the seat back when you aren't laying it flat to put something in the hatch has broke and been replaced twice.

It is very small, even for two people.  You can fit a car seat in the back but as soon as your child can sit there isn't enough room for feet to reach the floor in the back seats.  The front seats are also very cramped.  There is very little room for movement and it is just uncomfortable.  If you are any taller than 5'8&quot; then I can't see how you would find this to be a comfortable ride.  My head hits the roof every time I get into the car. Of course most sports cars are small but this one is a bit smaller than most.  Before purchasing this car we had a Mustang GT and it had twice as much room in it. 

Then the big problems came in the middle of last year.  This car had been a second car and was only driven by my husband until our big car broke down and we needed this car for all our daily running also.  Once the car had to be driven more than twice a week it decided to fall apart.  We had to replace a turbo and the motor in it.  Then a few weeks later the radio went all the way out and both the windows stopped working.  It took several months for us to get a motor in to have it fixed.  The car was in the shop from October 1999 until March 2000.  First they couldn't even find anyone to supply the motor, then we had to wait for it to be shipped, then the motor we got had a crack in it so they had to do the entire process all over again.  By the time we got the thing out of the shop it needed new tires.  Then just two weeks ago the transmission went out on it.

Maybe we just got the bad one.  I have heard many people say they love their stealth, but we have had a great deal of trouble out of ours.  It is back to running again and I am crossing my fingers that it stays running.  The worst part about when this car has something wrong with it is that the parts are hard to find and very expensive.  Even the simplest of repairs can cost a small fortune for this car.  If you already have one, good luck.  Hold on tight to your wallet.  Hopefully not everyone will have the same experience we have had with this car.<br><br>
