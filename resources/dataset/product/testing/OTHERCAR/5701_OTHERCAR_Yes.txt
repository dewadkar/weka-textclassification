            We purchased a 1998 Nissan Altima a little over two years ago, and it has been money well spent.  The main reason we bought the Altima was because we felt we were getting the most bang for our buck.  We paid about $18,000 for a GLE... and that included power windows/ locks, tilt cruise, a/c, CD and Cass, and power sunroof... just a lot of car for the money... especially when you compare it to a 626 or a Saturn as we did.  I have heard others complain about the cars ride and handling... I don't agree.  I think the car rides nicely and handles; to a certain extent, like a sports car.  This was the first Nissan we have had, but it will not be our last... we are currently considering moving up to a Maxima.  Nissan obviously builds a dependable car; as we have had no problems at all, and they certainly give you the maximum amount of car for the money that you spend.  Anyone who wants to get a great car; with the most for your money, the Nissan Altima is definately one to consider... besides Nissan has only improved upon it since 1998.<br><br>
