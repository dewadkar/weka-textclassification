            I absolutely love my car.  It is a '98 black Beetle named Daisi.  I love the way it handles and the styling both inside and out.  The only problem I can see with this car is that it is moderate to expensive to repair.  I recently was in an accident where my car was hit on the passenger side.  The one good thing is that because of the design of the car, it did not dent or crack.  However, the car is built in large pieces so that even for a small amount of damage, a large piece may need to be replaced.  This can get expensive.  I would definitely recommend this car to anyone provided they understand this fact.   It is such a fun car to own and drive that it makes up for its shortcomings in the &quot;repair-ability&quot; area.<br><br>
