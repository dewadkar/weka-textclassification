            My husband and I were considering buying a new vehicle.  I owned a Chevy Monte Carlo at the time and loved it, but we were thinking about starting a family and wanted something bigger.  We look at the Ford Explorer, Chevy Blazer and Dodge Durango--but ultimately decided on the Tahoe once we test drove one.  

I thought it was going to be too big for me to drive.  I'm only 5' 1&quot; and first thought it was going to feel like driving a school bus, but it doesn't.  It's just like driving a full-sized pick-up truck.

The Tahoe is roomy and comfortable.  We opted for rear AC and it is definitely a plus.  The 2000 model now has rear AC and heat.  The rear area had plenty of room.  I once had a big screen TV and a new computer (still in the boxes) piled in the back and still had room for other packages.

If your looking for the perfect vehicle to haul around friends, family, children and still have room for the groceries, this is the one for you.<br><br>
