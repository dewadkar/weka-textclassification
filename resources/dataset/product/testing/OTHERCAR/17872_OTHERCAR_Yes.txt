            OK! So you want to buy or lease a new SUV.  Our Jeep Grand Cherokee was a great vehicle, but the residuals on the Jeeps were ridiculously low, driving the monthly lease payments up by $60-70 per month for a car that had the same sticker price of 3 years ago.  We decided to look at other SUV's.  We started and stopped with the Blazer LS.

This vehicle has every convenience and luxury that our Jeep had, plus more!  It also has a smoother ride.  The Blazer rides like a luxury car.
And the big bonus is that it is $85 per month cheaper than a comparably equipped Grand Cherokee.

On the plus side:

Leather Interior
Power driver and front passenger seats
Two position memory on the driver's seat
Spare tire mounted underneath the rear
Smooth acceleration while entering onto the highway
Electronic Climate Control (Set it and forget it)
Sunroof (which the Jeep didn't have)

On the minus side:  

Shifter is mounted on the steering column
Cassette player is not integrated into the CD/AM/FM unit
That's why there is no floor shift
The radio has an Auto Tone button that you have to set every time you turn on the stereo.  It does not stay on the setting you last used.  If it is possible, I have yet to find a way to do it.

Overall, I would rate this vehicle very highly.  I don't think it is as stylish as the Grand Cherokee, but I think it is a better value.<br><br>
