            I have held back from buying a Digital camera for some time now, simply because I have never liked the size of the current camera's, nor the price! I read about the forthcoming Kodak DC3800 camera, and by all accounts it looked like this was going to be the answer to my prayers... was it? Read on and see...

Having spent ï¿½325.00 on the camera, and waiting around 5 weeks for delivery, I was desperate to start using the thing when it arrived. My initial response on opening the box was WOW. look at the size of this, this baby is TINY!

Ignoring the manual (hey, who reads em) I soon had the batteries inserted, the 8MB card installed, power it up and starting taking some shots.... I could feel my initial excitement fading.... and trying to keep a happy face around other people who were watching me testing the kit out was difficult... Why... read on...

First of all, using the eye piece for taking a shot is pretty unusable. There is no through the lens view, and that goes for the double zoom mode as well. You really have to hold the camera at the subject and look through the LCD screen, and hope for the best. In low light conditions, looking at the LCD screen is difficult because it seems to break up with weird red jaggy lines....

So, apart from the fiddly viewfinder, how did the images turn out? Well, as long as you have a steady hand, and allow the autofocus to kick in correctly the quality of the shots are very good. Due to the camera size, I certainly found that I was getting a lot of shake in the photo's, but you soon learn to go rigid when taking shots!

The camera controls are functional, though limited to basically viewing, deleting and formatting. There is an output for NTSC only video, though this is something I would have no use for, and this did not bother me.

To get the images into your PC for editing, there is a USB card reader supplied. This is excellent. It simply plugs into a USB port, you install some drivers, and thereafter the card reader gets treated as a removable drive on your system. By simply plugging in the 8MB card into the slot, you can just drag the files off or load them straight into a paint package.

I've been using the camera now for a month or so, and the portability of it is very good, unlike the larger camera's. Battery life, like all digital camera's is so-so, but as long as you carry some charged up batteries with you, this should present no problems at all.

In summing up, I miss the lack of viewfinder zoom, the variable zoom for easy cropping and that's about it. For what I am using the camera for, it's worth the money, but I would certainly suggest that you try this before you buy it as I don't think it will appeal to everyone.<br><br>
