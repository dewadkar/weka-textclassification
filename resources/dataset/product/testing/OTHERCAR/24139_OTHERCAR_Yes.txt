            When you have a smaller car, say for instance a honda or a mazda, etc. You can never fit all your friends/family all in at once, comfortably anyways. We bought a Lincoln about 4 months ago, and it has been reliable, and we haven't had any problems. The seats are nice, cushiony, comfortable, and it makes you feel like you could go to sleep sitting in them. This car has made it through everything, extremely hot weather, cold weather, and it runs the same through both. The only reason that I wouldn't recommend this car to someone would have to be the simple fact that the car drinks some major oil, and it occasionally smokes. I would recommend it to someone with a big family, that wouldnt want to buy a van, you can fit 6 people into a lincoln and they can all be wearing seat belts, and be comfortable. We personally bought this car for the simple fact that it was cheaper than going out and financing a car, and going through all that. They are definately worth however much you pay for them, because they are reliable cars, and they are very comfortable.
