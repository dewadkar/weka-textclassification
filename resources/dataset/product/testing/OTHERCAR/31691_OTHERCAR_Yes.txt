            I owned a 1998 Grand Prix SE for two and a half years until it was totaled in a crash in February. First off, I would like to state that this car was rock solid in a crash. Both my wife and I were completely safe in the cabin, the soft deploy air bags did their job and the front of the car crumpled and absorbed much of the impact just as it was designed to. This is clearly Detroit steel at it's best.

Over the two and a half years we had it, the car was almost perfect. The only problem we had was with an ABS sensor which was quickly replaced under warranty. This particular car was a base SE with a 3.1L V6. The 160hp was great for day to day driving and the 2000 model has 15 extra ponies with the same engine. The 3.8L 200hp engine is an option. Handling was very good and the 4 wheel disc brakes with ABS were top notch. 

The interior of the car was comfortable and the dash was well laid out. Some of the plastic used was a bit on the cheap looking side, but it was very functional. I really liked the cup holders which folded out of the center console.

This is a great entry level mid-size size sedan. It looks very sharp and it was about the same price as an entry level Taurus or 4 cyl Accord/Camry. We paid about $23,000 CDN (approx $16,500 US) and for the money you probably can't do better. The car has power everything standard and even this base model is fairly luxurious.
