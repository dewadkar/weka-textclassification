            I was looking for a new SUV to replace my Dodge Dakota.  My focus was primarily on the Jeep Cherokee because of it's &quot;bang for the buck&quot; ratio.  After being insulted by the dealer however, I decided to swing by the Nissan dealer on my way home.  They were having a sale on Pathfinders so I figured I could at least look.  I hadn't considered them before because they were too pricey.  

Well, I left with a new 1997 Pathfinder XE 4X4 5 speed with convenience and sport packages - all for only $2000 over the Cherokee's price.  Here's what I've found:  

LOVE IT:  

Interior - nice, logical (except the cruise switch), neat and durable.  Superb fit &amp; finish and it's quiet in there.  The seats are tightly woven cloth - supportive yet comfy and they don't grab at my clothes.  The base stereo is really good (AM/FM/CD - no cassette).  I could live inside of this truck :-)

Exterior - I really like the Pathfinder's lines.  The fit &amp; finish is excellent and it doesn't have too much plastic.  

Ride &amp; Handling - The steering and breaks are great.  Nissan uses rack &amp; pinion steering, sacrificing some off-road comfort for on-road feel.  Very nice.  The Pathfinder handles much like a car, definitely one of the best SUVs.  

WISH IT WAS BETTER:  

Engine performance - though the engine is super nice for around town driving, it really needs more ponies for the highway.  The 2001 Pathfinder has addressed this problem with a new engine.  This is by far the most significant pre-2001 Pathfinder shortcoming.  

Brakes - in this price range 4 wheel disc brakes should be standard.  

Suspension - I found the suspension to be too soft.  I would gladly sacrifice some ride comfort for better handling.  

Rear-window - You need to use the key to open the rear window.  This gets really old quite quickly...  

Overall, I'd buy another one in a heartbeat - especially the new 2001 with the better engine!
