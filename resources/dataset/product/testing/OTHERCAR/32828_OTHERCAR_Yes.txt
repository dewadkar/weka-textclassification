            First of all, this car is a <b>LOW END</b> car.  They sell it to you for cheap because they make it cheap.  For the most part, you get what you pay for.<br><br>

This car was purchased by my girlfriend in 1997 with 42,000 miles on it at $6,000 at an auction.  She didn't know its history, but it ran great, the body was immaculate, it was fun to drive, and with that price it was a steal.  <b>SO</b> glad she chose to buy it because it has proved to be well worth the money.  In the last 6 years since she bought it, we have had our share of problems.  The problems we had are as follows:<br><br>

-  The most money we have spent is on the cooling system.  The heater core had to be replaced due to a massive leak, the radiator was also replaced due to a leak, and the (water) pump was replaced due to the engine getting hot.  The engine still continued to get hotter than normal, and the next component we were to replace was the thermostat.<br>
-  It also had an issue with being able to turn the key in the ignition, which apparently is a known issue.<br>
-  At some point the trunk stopped opening with the key - we can only open it through the release "switch" near the driver's seat.<br>
-  The lights behind the a/c control panel partially died out.  If you hit the panel it sometimes will light them up again.<br>
-  At some point both headlamps died and you could only use the high beams.  Then before we had a chance to buy new bulbs, they started working again...  electrical problem?  who knows, but they worked fine until the end of the vehicle's life.<br>
-  Several minor problems with leaks of various fluids.  We could probably fix these by a trip to the shop, but we are too busy and do not think it's worth the time or money.  We simply top off the fluids and keep going.  We have had to top off the clutch fluid, coolant (see above issues about leaks), and oil due to very slow leaks.<br><br>
-  At some point the seat belt would not hold the male part of the clip in securely - if you tugged with some light force it would come out.  Again, this issue seemed to have fixed itself somehow.<br><br>

We kept on a strict oil-changing schedule of every 3,000 miles, which was quite often considering how much we drove it.  Our expectations were that it would reach 100,000 miles and then either die or acquire a fortune in repair bills, as do many low end, cheap cars.  This is keeping in mind the fact that we have never treated the car nicely, have taken it on <b>numerous</b> road trips, and that we have not taken the car in to have a professional fix it for minor issues such as leaks and cooling system problems (we have replaced all components ourselves).<br><br>

In fact it did not "die" until 145,000 + miles and 6 years later.  Starting last winter (2002), the car began to hesitate when driving it in the morning, and then in a sudden burst it would jerk forward and drive fine.  From that point on, it would drive fine (aside from a significant decrease in performance) until the next morning.  Again, since we are busy and poor students, we did not take it into the shop.  We drove the car like this for quite some time and at some point the problem seemed to "fix itself" like so many other problems with this car.  We brushed it off, and since there was no check engine light, we really didn't think much of it.  Then, just this week it finally gave up.  It started stuttering more than before, and it would not "fix itself" - it was simply not drivable.  Took it in to a reputable shop (man it costs a lot for good service!) to get it diagnosed and they say we need a new engine.  Supposedly the most likely cause of this is the lack of treatment of the over-heating problem, since every time we drive it it runs very hot (cylinder 3's spark plug was not removable, likely because its plastic had melted it onto the terminal!).  I wasn't quite able to understand exactly what was is wrong with it, but it sounds similar to the other issues described where the head gasket is blown.  No milkiness in the oil though...  Anyway, it will need to have the engine rebuilt or replaced, and it's just not worth the money.<br><br>

Bottom line, we got what we paid for, and it was worth it while it lasted.  A new Cavalier is recommended if you want a good deal, but it is not recommended to buy one if it has more than 125,000 miles.
