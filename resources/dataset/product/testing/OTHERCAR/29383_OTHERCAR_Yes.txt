            Recently, my mother purchased a pre-owned 1999 Toyota Avalon with only 3,000 Miles on it.  After my initial disappointment that she did not purchase a V6 Honda Accord, I gave her the benefit of the doubt and drove the car myself.  I was initially put off by the size of the car (almost as big as her boyfriends Cadillac!), but it handled just as well as my Honda and rode even smoother.  And, much to my surprise, the V6 is just as powerful as the Honda (although not as fuel efficient).  Being the new higher end Toyota, the Avalon is loaded with lots of nice extras, including leather seats, a nice car stereo (with CD player and the expandability of adding a CD changer), and enough room to house a small family.  Now, I want to trade with her!<br><br>
