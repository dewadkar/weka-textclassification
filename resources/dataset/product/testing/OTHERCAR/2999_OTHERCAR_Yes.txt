            This is my first car. I bought it from the original owner and it is still in great shape even though it has 197k miles on it now. I've had it about a month and I couldn't ask for much more as a high school student. It gets me around, drives straight, doesn't guzzle gas/oil and is just a great car. <br>I think I'll just list things I like/don't like about it here.<br><br>Good stuff:<br>1) Drives straight. This car drives extremely well for being 10 yrs old and having 197k miles. On straight roads I can do things with both hands and not have to worry about keeping the wheel straight or about drifting. <br><br>2) MPG. I'm a student and I only have a part time job so I can't afford more than one fill-up/week, especially since gas is so stinkin' expensive. So far I figure I'm getting about 22-25 MPG. That's awesome for anything less than a Honda or Toyota. <br><br>3) Seats/leg room. As a student I'm also taxi-ing my friends around a lot so I need a lot of room. The seats are very comfortable. I can easily stand a 2 hour drive without pain/discomfort. Also there is plenty of leg room for everyone so no one feels squished.<br><br>4) Hatchback/Fold down seat. I love this feature. The back seat folds down and opens the trunk into the main part of the car. It's really easy to do and only takes a few seconds. One night we were out and about and fit about 5 people in the back with the seat down. That was fun. :)<br><br>5) Visibility. You can always see what is going on around you. The dividers between the doors/windows are not too big so there is nothing to obstruct the your view (except my fuzzy dice :)<br><br>6) Heat/AC. I should mention that the heater and AC is pretty good. It only takes about a minute or two to warm up the cab. Also the AC is good.<br><br>Bad stuff:<br><br>1) Hood/trunk. The paint on the hood and trunk is fading or coming off or something. We think they were origionally painted in a different factory and the colors didn't match so they repainted them. But the new paint didn't bond and it's coming off now. It's not a problem but it doesn't look that good.<br><br>2) Radio LCD. The radio's LCD has shorted out or something because it doesn't light up. The radio itself works great but you just can't see what station you're on.<br><br><br><br>
