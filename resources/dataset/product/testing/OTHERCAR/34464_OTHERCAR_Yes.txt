            In 1999 I bought my second Metro. I had a 1993 Geo Metro previously, and after 150,000 miles it gave up the ghost. After lots of mourning, I decided to get another Metro. After all, it was the same car I'd just had, really, wasn't it?

No, it wasn't it.

Two adults could ride comfortably in the '93 model, but in the 1999 Metro, the passenger seat does not move far back enough to make tall riders comfortable. Alot of my passengers ride with their knees kissing the dashboard.  The seats don't provide good back support either. I never noticed it on short trips, but any ride over 30 minutes leads to back strain. 

The gas mileage is still outstanding, around 45 mpg. But that is with a manual transmission and no AC. I have no idea how those would affect the mileage, but I bet it would fall to under 40 mpg.

The interior of the car is spartan, and creature comforts are just about non-existant. The heat and defrosters work well, but the side windows have a tendency to fog that is not relieved by the defogger. The finish is cheap, and it looks it. The plastic beauty trims on the seats are poorly fitted on mine, and they look terrible. The car squeaks terribly. A little more attention to finish would have gone a long way with this car.

The hatchback design is nice, and allows a considerable amount of cargo space. I've hauled a 27 inch TV in mine, for instance, and gotten the trunk lid closed.

The tires went bad in 19,000 miles, and the dealer (in AZ) would not honor the warranty on them because they had been improperly balanced - at the dealer in Ohio! Actually the car came with lousy tires. When we switched to Michelins - about $400, the improvement was noticeable.

The manual transmission is easy to use, but it vibrates terribly at idle, and my service center couldn't find any reason for it. "Cheaply built" they told me. 

The engine allows good access to the fluids, and sparkplugs, but beyond minor maintenance, this is a "take me to the shop " car. 

Actually, I think the price was pretty high for what was delivered.

Bottom line: I really liked my '93 Metro, but the 1999 does not compare to it in finish, ride or comfort. I'm going to take a look at Hyundai and Kia before I buy my next car.
