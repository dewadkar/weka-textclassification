            Right up front, I need to profess to being a photography wanna-be as opposed to others in this category whose reviews were so helpful and informative when I wanted a digital camera.  They know a lot more than me about the technical aspects of digital technology, etc., so I won't attempt to show expertise on something I am far from expert on. Rather, this review is specifically to add my "ditto" to their thumbs-up review of the Olympus C-3000 Zoom Digital Camera.

If you happen to be in the "average experience" user category that I am, you will be quite pleased with it and with the quality of the pictures, ease of use and convenience of immediately deleting a picture you don't like or saving one that you do. I'm still ecstatic over the whole concept of being able to see right away a picture I just took seconds ago, so if I sound like a kid in a candy store, bear with me.  If anything,I hope I can offer you a tip or two about the actual buying experience and point you in the direction of a "great deal" like the one I feel I got.

Indeed, the C-3000Z can be pricey, but I find that purchasing online definitely gives you an edge here.  For example, I went to Best Buy live and in person, and got the whole red carpet treatment from a very knowledgeable salesperson who patiently answered all my questions.  They wanted $599.00 for the basic camera. By basic I mean it comes with only an 8MB Memory Card, USB/Serial cable, software, strap and the initial lithium batteries required for the camera. I held off from my impulsive buy impulse and said I'd be back. 

I came right home and went online to Best Buy's website and, lo and behold, it was $499, a whopping $100 less.  Unbelievable but true. Lesson learned is be aggressive, look around on the Internet and do some price comparison before you buy (try MySimon or even the feature here on Epinions that lets you compare prices) because the quotes fluctuate wildly, depending on what accessories you want outside of the basic package. 

And, for those of you who don't already know this, the accessories must be where the profit is for many dealers because they can cost you a fortune. 

Memory cards, depending on the manufacturer, are the biggest expense of all (that is, for folks who aren't professionals). Add on Card Readers, battery chargers, and extra lithium batteries and you are looking at a minimum of $200 (at least!) on top of the initial cost of the camera.

My C-3000 came with only an 8MB card but I got a "deal" with State Street Direct (online) where they included a nice little accessory kit with the camera for about another $100 - it included two additional 32MB cards, a battery charger (a MUST when you are using lithium batteries and want the freedom to roam around without an electrical outlet having to be nearby), another pair of lithium batteries and a soft carrying case. I should add that my supposedly "great deal" still ran me just over $600 with the shipping but the site is wonderful to shop and the customer support already has impressed me.  

The dealer I bought from, State Street Direct, was temporarily out of stock when I ordered the camera around Labor Day and they actually meant it when they said "temporarily" because I had the camera by the 14th. I have had the previous experience of waiting nearly a month for such a product but not this time. Not just that, but they have an interactive "ask a salesperson a question" feature on their website (at statestreetdirect.com) and he was very helpful when I asked him for a time frame on delivery.  They actually came in under their expected date so I was pleased with that.

Back to the camera: how can I say this, it just "fits" me very well, from the nice fit it has in the palm of my hand (no fumbling around trying to find the telephoto/wide angle lever which is right next to the shutter) to the crisp color and quality the pictures have, both on the LCD screen and even more so on my computer.  I am somewhat limited (as I have already confessed) in my photography hobby experience but I can tell you the pictures my C-3000 produces are the best I have seen.  Our 16 year old cat has that distinguished touch of white hair in his jet black coat that normally is undetectable in other pictures I have taken of him. Now, I can actually discern those gray/white hairs from his natural color. 

The Olympus C-3000 was the right choice for me, based on what I need it for, of course.  I was not necessarily interested in the absolute high end camera but this is no slouch, boasting a 3.4 Megapixel output the main advantage being that you can get great quality in pictures you want to enlarge and not lose the sharpness or excellent color.  Its one drawback (which I am already noticing but not really minding) is in the capacity of its zoom feature.  It allows you a modest amount of room for zooming in or back but is probably not ideal if you are attending a concert, let's say, and want to be able to photograph the lead singer's left earring!  

For my purposes, however, this is plenty of camera for me and I am already shouting its praises to anyone who will listen.  Hopefully, my future use will be as satisfactory as my current experience is.  If not, I will certainly update my review.  

Just to recap,however, please DO do some serious research online for the lowest cost, because there are a number of "deals" out there that include some of the costlier accessories at a reduced rate and that is where the true savings tend to be. Both statestreetdirect.com and even Amazon.com had some competitive prices.  Enjoy.
