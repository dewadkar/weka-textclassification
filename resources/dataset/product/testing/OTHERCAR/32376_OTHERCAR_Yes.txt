            The Lincoln Navigator is one of the finest SUV's that i have had the chance to experience.  The ride the Navigator is one of the best of any car on the road to date in my opinion.  It comes with a superior sound system that is great for any kind of music that you may chose to listen to.  The comfortable interior of the car makes it fun to ride in and drive.  Also, it is very high in crash test since the air bags for both driver and passenger and of the highest quality.  As well as all the features on the car it also has a great look which is one of the most important things about a car that one buys.  The Navigator comes in many colors from the standard black, to almost any color of choice.  The Lincoln Navigator is by far one of the best SUV's on the road today a I strongly suggest that if you want a SUV you look into the Navigator<br><br>
