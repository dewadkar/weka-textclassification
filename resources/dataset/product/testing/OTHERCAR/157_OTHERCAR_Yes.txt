            This is a nice camera.  Takes pictures well, and the quality is good enough for any webmaster/mistress/it.
However, a few months later, I found that dust got under the lens, under the flash, and in the viewfinder.  Only the LCD screen was cleanable.  (Oh, slight problem with the LCD, but that'd be picky for this camera... it's right where your nose is, so you can't help but leave some sort of smudge when you take a picture)
The result of this dust was that the pictures no longer were crisp, not even at the highest resolution and sharpness.  There would be little spots of light all over the pictures, and the only thing to do to get a nice picture was to take it at a high resolution and shrink it.

This is a good deal, and can take some really nice pictures, but be careful that you don't get dust near any of the glass parts.

Ah.  Battery life.  If you're not fond of buying batteries, then don't use the electric viewfinder.  The batteries hate it when you use the viewfinder...  so don't.  You may last two days.  Otherwise, it'll last you... well, far longer.
