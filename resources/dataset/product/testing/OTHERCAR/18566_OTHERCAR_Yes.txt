            I've been wanting a digital camera for a while, but the cameras with the features I wanted were too expensive.  But just after Christmas Casio came out with the qv-8000.  I got it for under $500 on sale, and I love it!

The main thing about this camera is that it has a ton of features, but it's not &quot;top of the line&quot;.  I wanted manual focus an exposure options, but I didn't need a 2.5 megapixel camera.

So here's a quick list of some of the features I love so much:

+ manual or automatic focus
+ Auto/set shutter/set speed exposure options.  (it even does minute long exposures for cool night shots, or storms)
+ panorama mode 
+ macro focus as close as 2 cm from the lens
+ complete menu system for setting features.
+ exposure adjust (for making the shot a little lighter or darker)
+ up to 10 seconds of video capture.
+ included USB cable
And there are more...

Let me give one example of how well realized all these features are.  The Panaramic mode is not just a silly &quot;letterbox&quot; effect to make the picture seem wider.  It actually allows you to take multiple shots side to side, and the camera stiches them together.  After you take the first shot, the right hand side of the shot shows up on the left of the viewfinder, so you can line up the next in the sequence.  When your done, the camera can play the shots all back as a scrolling image.  I've done many shots that were 360 degree images of the view from one place.  Very fun.

And all the features show this kind of good design.  It's all easy to use and easy to learn.  The big knob on the top selects the mode.. (photo - landscape photo - panorama - movie - etc...)  And a small slider switch allows you to quickly pop between taking and playing your photos.  Great to check up on the shot you just took, and show someone else.  

The only downsides to this camera are ones you have with any digital camera.  It drains battery's like crazy, and it's hard to see the screen in full sunlight.  You can use your hand to shade the screen, though.  And for batteries I highly recommend Kodak's new high capacity Ni-MH batteries.  I bought a set of 4 with charger when I got the camera, and I can easily fill all 32 megs of my memory cards with photos before having to charge.  And it only takes an hour to charge them.<br><br>
