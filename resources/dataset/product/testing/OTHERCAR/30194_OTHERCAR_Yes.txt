            We bought our Dodge Caravan in 1993.  It was a a used 1992 van with 20,000 miles on it.  At the time we still had three children living at home.  We are still driving it, but now it has 120,000 miles on it.  It has been a wonderful van for trips.  We only have one child at home now but still love to drive it.  It is comfortable and easy to heat and cool.  It is the short caravan and not the long one.  It has been easy to care for and has not had any major repairs only general maintenance every one has on their vehicle, to keep it running smoothly. I would highly recommend this van for families.<br><br>
