             <b>A</b>lmost a million Jeeps were built during World War II. They were simple, rugged, reliable, and could go just about anywhere the military wanted them to. It is these qualities many customers still look for in a Jeep Wrangler to this very day, however it's become more about fashion than anything else. The Jeep Wrangler was re-introduced in 1997 as its current generation.


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>

   <b>W</b>hat began the original purpose built military off-roader is still built today, but is used more as a trendy transporter than the off-roader four-wheeler that it is. The 1998 Jeep Wrangler is very fun to drive, and is a very capable off road vehicle. 
<b>Acceleration</b> is a bit sluggish, especially on hills. My friend's had the inline 4.0 6-cylinder engine, with 184 horse power, and 220 lb-ft of torque. With such adequate horse power and torque one would think this vehicle would do quite a job on hills, But it didn't. Down-shifting from 5th into 4th hardly did any good, and to keep up with the rest of up-hill traffic I was constantly flooring the gas pedal. Acceleration from a green light is adequate, but after 3rd gear this thing really lugs down. I have read that the 0-60 time is 8.8 seconds, but I'm not so sure that is correct. 
<b>Handling</b> is fair, take a turn too sharp and you can get scared to death, but this car is not a Ferrari, so don't expect to drive it like one (so I have learned). The 1998 Jeep Wrangler's 4-wheel drive system is not permanently engaged like in some 4 WD vehicles. It can be selected when required for ice, snow, or off road driving. The 4WD feature can also be switched in and out while the vehicle is moving. 
<b>Braking</b> is excellent, there are large disc brakes in the front, and drums in the back. The 1998 Jeep Wrangler also comes with a base 4-cylinder model, transmissions include a 5-speed manual(standard) and a 3-speed automatic which is ideal for city driving.

  <b>About the engine:</b> The engine is fairly robust, the 4.0 cast iron straight-six is an AMC design. It features a single block-mounted camshaft, driving two valves per cylinder with pushrods, rockers, and hydrolic lifters. The engine is torquey and very reliable. The 4.0 produces its peak horse power of 184 at 4,600 RPM. This low RPM Power makes it ideal for Off-roading. A concession to modern times is the semi sophisticated sequential electronic fuel injection system.

  <b>Suspension:</b> Like Its 'Willys' Ancestor, the Wrangler has a sturdy ladder type frame chassis. Live rear axles are used in the front and rear. Coil springs replace the leaf springs of the earlier Wrangler and give a much smoother ride! The 1998 Wrangler also features high and low four-wheel-drive ratios.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

  The <b>interior</b> of the Jeep Wrangler Sahara is surprisingly modern. Comfortable waterproof green, and tan bucket seats were fitted. I can not comment on the stock stereo system, my friend had an Infiniti system installed which sounded excellent. Ergonomics are perfect. While off-roading good ergonomics are essential! There is a plethora of gauges, including a tachometer, temp gauge, etc. Amenities are not this Jeep's strong assets. This is a waterproof interior so some amenities are sacrificed. The only complaint I have about the interior of the Jeep Wrangler is the glove box. While hardcore off-roading as a passenger my shoes somehow scratched the glove box severely. I don't know if it was my shoes exactly that did this, but afterwords both the glove box and my friend did not look happy. There is a removable cloth top that is a little tricky, but you get the hang of it quite fast. This removable top makes for some fun times during the summer, just make sure you wear sunscreen, and make sure the top is on during rides through brush. I was bitten by 2 spiders, and 1 tick all in 1 day because the top was down. The driver was spared.

<i>Exterior innovation:</i>

   The <b>exterior</b> is very rugged looking. Although outwardly similar, the 1997-2000 Wranglers share no body panels with its predecessor, except for the doors. The shape has been softened, and round headlights are used again for the first time since 1986. Today many Wranglers are bought as much for image as for their off road ability. Five-spoke aluminum wheels are standard equipment on the Sahara. The full sized spare tire sits on the tailgate, the cover has a palm tree on it, with big white lettering that says 'Sahara'.
There is also this logo on the sides of the vehicle to designate the Sahara from the lesser trim lines. Factory fitted tires are appropriately Wrangler Off-roaders. The Sahara also comes with an underplate that protects your engine, transmission, and exhaust system from getting punctured while traveling over huge rocks. 

  The <b>price</b>, new, in 1998 for a Sahara 4.0 was around $25,000. Today prices are still pretty high, expect to pay around $17,000. As for reliability, I never owned this vehicle, so I can not personally comment, but my friend somehow lost all her oil, drove 10 miles, and the engine still ran after the problem was fixed. In-fact she said it ran better, go figure.
