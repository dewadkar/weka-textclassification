  I like the sleek lines of this car. It is very functional, but it still has a bit of flair. The design puts the car right in the middle of the sport compact category, though this car is generally aimed at the family car market. The interior is very classy. The simple design of the dash gives some of the racy feel of the Audi TT. This car drives very well. Smooth acceleration, nice handling, comfortable highway speed, this car really has everything that a person could hope for in a small family car. The only problem is that it is at the very top end of that bracket's price range. I wasn't anywhere close to being able to pay for one of these. If you get the v6 the price can range up to about 27 thousand. Still this is a very nice car, and I would recommend it to anyone who can afford it.
