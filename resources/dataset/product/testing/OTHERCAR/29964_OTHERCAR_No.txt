            We owned a 1987 and a 1991 Dodge Caravan.Both cars were disasters. The first one we bought,we owned for about 3 months before it started making weird noises.Bottom line,it was going to cost us $2500 to have the engine rebuilt in it.We took it back to the dealership and traded it in for the 1991.We had it for one month and the SAME problems started with this one.It was smoking,the transmission was slipping,etc.Problem after problem,we did a voluntary repo just to get rid of it. I would not recommend the older Caravans to anyone. The newer ones I could not tell ya,because we are staying away from Dodge cars.<br><br>
