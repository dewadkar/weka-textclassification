            My father loves to look at cars.  However, ever since he purchased a Nissan Maxima, I have not seen him go car shopping or even looking.  He seems to be extremely satisfied with the 1996 Maxima that he purchased a few years back.  He has had very few complaints if any and it has only been in the shop a couple of times.  After riding in this car a number of times I have found that I too enjoy the car.  It gives a smooth ride and cuts out a lot of the outside noises that you encounter while driving.  It is also roomy in the front seat and in the back so it is excellent for families.  Good gas milage is also a plus that makes this car worth the money.  It seems as though my father visits the gas station scarecly.  One thing I have found that annoys my dad is that when he cleans it with armor all or some other cleaning product, it leaves the dashboard greasy and he hates that.  All in all, I'm sure my dad would recommend this car to anyone.<br><br>
