            I bought my 1992 Safari van used in 1995.  I paid $11,000 for it and it had 70,000 miles on it.  I wasn't sure how it would hold up, but we had just had our third child and had to get a van quickly.
Well, I will say that I was pleasantly surprised.  I recently sold the van, which has over 170,000 miles on it, and it is still going strong.  I got rid of it simply because I wanted a new van.

Compared to other minivans, the Safari is not the most comfortable to ride in.  Starting with the driver's area, the seats in the front did not adjust at all, except for forward and back.  Also, there were no arm rests, so you had to drive sitting straight up, with no place to rest your arms.  Very uncomfortable position to drive in.

Secondly, the van drives like a truck.  I guess this is a feature some people are looking for, but I like a car-like ride.

Another disadvantage was the difficulty in removing the back seats.  They are extremely heavy and are hard to remove even with two people.

On the plus side, the van held up remarkably well.  I didn't have any major maintenance problems and the van still looked very good after 8 years and 170,000 miles on the road.  

If you're looking for good, reliable transportation without all the fluff, then this is the van for you.<br><br>
