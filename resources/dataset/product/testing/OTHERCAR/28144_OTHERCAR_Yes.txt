            the Poloroid Photomax PDC-700 digital is really a good investment if your going to take pictures of things fairly close up like lets say 50 feet at maximum. it comes with a flash and 3 settings of resolution. for each of the resolutions, there's a certain amount of pictures that you can take. on the lowest one, you can take more, the highest you can take less but it's worth the quality and you can do a combination of the three. another feature that I've always liked is that you can hook it up to a VCR or something and use it as a silent video camera. also, if you take a picture and you don't like it, you can delete it. I still am in the process of messing around with this digital camera so I won't claim to know everything about it but I will say that it was great for your money. the only bad things are that the batteries run out quick and the photo program it comes with is aawful. I recomend using Microsoft pictureIt.
