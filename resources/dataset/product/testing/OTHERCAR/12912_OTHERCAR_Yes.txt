            My galant is a 1994 model. I bought it in 1996, so I have had it for 4 years. The model that I have is FULLY loaded. Auto EVERYTHING plus extras like cd player, sunroof, and lumbar seats. I have not had any problems with my car and I have put it to a test. Where I live everything is far away, so I have tacked on the miles with going to town, school, doctors, and work.

We are a family of four with our 2 boys in car seats. BUT I must say that the back will comfortably seat 3, even though 2 are in the car seats. I myself have even road in the back and had plenty of room.

Gas mileage is great. Though I do not know the exact numbers. The car is made durable. I must say that I have had a couple of run in with rocks in the road, but no real damage.

Any time you buy a used car you must realize that you might just be getting a useless lemon. With used cars there are no real guarntees and usually no warranties. I was one of the lucky ones. I got a Perfect car that has done great in the 4 years I have owned it. If I had to go back and do it again I would by this same car.<br><br>
