            I bought a 1995 Chevrolet Cavalier as my first new car while I was in college.  At the time I thought I was making a wise financial move, but have discovered differently since.  Although the Cavalier seems sporty and quite affordable, there are hidden costs and annoyances...beware!

The Cavalier is much roomier than it looks--the seats are nice-sized and the trunk is pretty big.  There is plenty of head room and the front seats are easily moved to a comfortable position for almost anyone.  However, many &quot;little things&quot; have gone wrong with my car.  For instance, the front passenger seat no longer locks into place correctly.  The dealership has had to replace mine twice.  The trunk occasionally refuses to latch, which creates quite a problem.  Also, the dashboard has a constant rattle.  I have had these things replaced, repaired, etc.  but I am still not satisfied.

I will say that Chevy's Roadside Assistance is good.  I would definitely recommend buying the extended assistance, as well as the extended warranty.  Recently my brakes have been bad.  I've had them checked and fixed and when I asked the man who repaired my brakes, &quot;What is wrong with my car?&quot;  his reply was, &quot;Crappy car.&quot;  So apparently I am not the only unsatisfied owner.  Now the car runs fine, but the ABS light is on all the time, although there is no brake problem, nor an electrical problem with the display lights.  Occasionally my emergency parking brake light also illuminates, which is annoying.

All in all, I am disappointed.  I have had this car for less than five years and I'm looking for a new car right now.  I had hoped to spend a few payment-free years with my Cavalier, but that is certainly not going to happen.  My trade-in value is also sure to be a disappointment.<br><br>
