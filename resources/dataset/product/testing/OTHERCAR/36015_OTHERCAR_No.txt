            I bought this car for $500 from my aunt who was moving to Florida and didn't want to haul a second car the 2,000 miles. I live in a rural town in Northern Iowa, and she lived in Des Moines, and driving a Hyundai down there is actually quite common, but once you get up into the rural sections of the state, it's almost unheard of. I'm 16 years old and I had the only Hyundai in the high school parking lot, and one of the 4 in town, and the oldest! I LOVED it, nonetheless. I got it in March 2002, and didn't get my license until May, so for those 2 months I backed up and down the driveway, just itching to take it out on the road. It was a manual transmission so I had to learn how to drive a stick, which at first I hated but learned to love. When I finally got my license, I was off and running (sort of). It got great gas mileage, the room was great (especially with a boyfriend ;) ), but it didn't have any options at all. No tilt wheel, cassette player was the only option, manual windows, locks, seats, and had big coffee stains on the passenger seat that just wouldn't come out. The seats were small for my boyfriend, who complained of not enough leg room, but since I'm not even 5 feet tall, it was perfect for me. The cracks between the seats were impossible to reach with a vacuum cleaner. Not much power, but acceleration was moderate for a sedan. I hated the whining sound of it, and the horn was an embarassment when trying to get someone's attention. But it was unique - not one of the Grand Prix's that everyone had! But then tragedy struck.

I hit a pothole about 2 feet in diameter in the city, and for the week following that, it made a very very loud scary noise. I was leaving one day to visit my mom in the hospital up in Mason City, IA, when my dad comes inside to tell me that I was going to have to wait to go with him, because he just killed my car. He was backing it out of the driveway for more room when it just shook violently and shut off, out of nowhere. He thought he had just let off the clutch too fast and tried to start it again, with no luck. It sounded like the battery was out, but it wasn't. He even went and invested another $55 in a new battery, but that wasn't the case either. He took it up to the shop, where they refused to work on it! They said the problem was the timing belt, it slipped and possibly bent the valves up, but they wouldn't look and see because they didn't know how to work on Hyundais. That's where the fact that it's a foreign car in a very American place is a downside. He took it to a different shop on the outside of town and they agreed to look at it. In the meantime, when my dad told me it might be junk, I totally broke down and bawled. That was my baby! I'd been driving it for a whole year (it was now March 2003) and I had grown to love its quirkiness and individuality. Anyway, it took the shop 2 weeks to pull the engine out and come to the conclusion that all the valves were bent up, and it would cost $2100 to repair. Keep in mind that I only paid $500 for the car, and it was only worth MAYBE $700, since it was a baseline model with a manual transmission and only 65,000 miles. Anyway, they called down to the original dealer in Des Moines, and the first question they asked was "It's a 1993, isn't it? You might as well junk it." Seems that the timing belt slipped on nearly all the '93s and, while they repaired the problem in 1994, I was out of luck. We looked through records from when my aunt owned it, and found that the same thing had happened at around 6,000 miles and it had been repaired on warranty. All in all, it was a nice try by Hyundai, and would have been a great car for a teenager or a small family, if it didn't have that little (but costly) problem. We pulled the tires and the new battery out of it, parked it at my grandfather's farm, and are currently waiting for a guy to pick it up for scrap metal. Less than 3 days later, my dad bought a 1995 Ford Probe SE, and I couldn't be happier.
