            This is a great vehicle to drive if you are part of the carpool set.  I love the fact that you can get a second sliding door, the fact that it is roomy enough to sit adults, as long as your friends are not too tall!  It is also wonderful that they have the optional built-in carseats, which is great for those of us with young children, no more fumbling to get the seat in, no more having to lug a seat in and out everytime you change vehicles...  Furthermore it has a lot of bells and whistles that make it fun to drive. My favorite?  a display that lets you know how many miles you can drive before running our of gas!  It is roomy enough to pack up all of the kids' junk.  Best of all, it is quiet enough so that you can hear the little voice in the back telling you that he has to &quot;go right now!&quot;  It drives as well as a car, the only drawback is that it doesn't have the greatest amount of power.  All in all, the kind of minivan that is great for families on the go, go ,go.  And for those of us who like to wear straight skirts, it is not so far off the ground that you have to hike your skirt to mid-thigh to get in!
