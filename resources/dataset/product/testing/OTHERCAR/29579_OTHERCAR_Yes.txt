            I absolutely love my Nissan Quest.  This is my fourth one and I will keep buying them because they keep getting better each year. My 2000 Quest even has a television/VCR


 inside, and as a mother of four, that's awesome. I have never had a single problem with any of them.  They have been more than reliable. I travel a lot out of state and they have never let me down.
I am so glad they added the double sliding doors, because I can truly say, that was the only thing that I did not like about my other models.
The Nissan Quest is a great machine.
