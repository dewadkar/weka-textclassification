            I am so impressed with the TrailBlazer's performance, feel, appearance and LACK of sound! I honestly can't think of anything I would change or improve! (Except maybe the  annoying little icons on all of the controls...) 

My last vehicle was a 1983 3/4 ton Suburban 4x4. I desperately wanted to "down-size", and was seriously considering the 4 door Tracker with the 6 cylinder engine, until I actually test-drove one. 

I knew I wouldn't feel safe or comfortable in such a tiny thing, so I started looking at mid-size SUV's like the Durango, Montero, Envoy & TrailBlazer. After comparing horsepower, passenger room, cargo/towing capacity, and price, I was thought the TrailBlazer sounded too good to be true. 

I read some reviews that described the steering and handling as "mushy". I haven't found that to be the case, but considering the steering and handling of my '83 Suburban, that's probably not saying much...

Some people also complained about wind-noise from the driver's side window. I haven't heard ANY noises from ANYTHING! For a mid-size SUV it feels surprisingly solid and sturdy.

The most impressive thing is how quick, yet quiet, the engine is!
