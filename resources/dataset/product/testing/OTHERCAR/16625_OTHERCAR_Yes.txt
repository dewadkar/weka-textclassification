            Recently my girlfriend picked-up the New Accent by Hyundai. For under $10,000 is a descent bargain compared to a Honda Civic and Toyota Echo. For under 10G's she got AM/FM and A/C, &quot;got to how A/C,&quot; and the 5 speed for a good bargain.

Hyundai offer a 10 year 100,000 mile warranty on the powertrain and 5 year 60,000 mile warranty bumper to bumper plus the paint. The is advertised to get 28 city 36 hwy for miles per gallon.

The room inside the passenger compartment is more than adequate. The headroom is plunty for myself at 5'10&quot;. The rear seating give adequate room for two adults. Leg room depending on the driver and front passenger seating position is good enough unless you are 6'2&quot;+. The rear hatch (trunk) is very good but the cover over the spare tire sucks. Do not attempt to sit or stand unless you are a 5 year old.

The instruments for the basic model is fair. It lacks a Tachometer, especially if you are a first time stick driver like my girlfriend was. It has the MPH, Fuel, and Water gauges. And I can't forget the IDIOT LIGHTS. 

The Accent has two motors. The 1.5 liter SOHC and the 1.6 liter. Of course we have the 1.5 liter. For a econo-box it has good pick for about 95-100 hp. But compared to my 5.7 liter V-8 it is MAD SLOW. The Five speed moves adequately for daily driving. We fueled with an average of 24 mpg for stop and go at every parking lot (since she was learning stick) to a respectable 29 city stop and go traffic.

All in all the Accent is a great leap from the Excel in many aspects and for under $10,000 with A/C is a starter for the High School Grad. and College get around. The Value and Econo, in todays' gas struggling world, is strong.   <br><br>
