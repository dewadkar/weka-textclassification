            Toyota Camry Solara, 2002

Put a Little Sun in your Life.

Toyota is trying to attract a younger base of customer with a new sportier looking Camry. The Camry is now available in three different trims. The SE which is the base model, than the SE V-6 which gets a stronger engine and the SLE V-6 which is the convertible model.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The object of this review is the SLE V-6 convertible trim. I always enjoyed driving convertibles, especially on small country roads and with the top down. 

The Toyota Solara SLE V-6 is a beautiful and stylish looking automobile. Once you have decided to go for the convertible, you already get a car that is very well equipped and for about only a $1,000.00 more you can get it full equipped.

THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR

The interior:

The Solara I had the opportunity to test drive was full equipped and had less that 1200 miles on the odometer. Once the top was down, I immediately knew I was going to enjoy this ride. 

The car had fine leather seats and door trim and even with the top down the smell of new leather was present. 

From behind the steering wheel the drive has an excellent all around vision. All the gauges are easy to see and read and all the control buttons are within easy reach also.

The car was equipped with the optional JBL audio system, which comes with 8 speakers for your enjoyment.    The quality of the sound is excellent.

The car I test drove had the following standard features: air conditioning, power windows, power locks, power mirrors, tilt steering, cruise control, AM/FM radio cassette, CD player, heated mirrors and rear spoiler. Plus it had an option package that added the JBL sound system, leather interior, alloy wheel, outside temperature guage, anti-theft system and traction control. I made a fast calculation and the package cost added about $1,000.00 to the car.

The front legroom is very good as for the rear you may want to reconsider going on a long trip with anyone who has long legs sitting in the rear seat.

The exterior:

As I mentioned I really like convertible, I have rarely seen one that I did not like. This is no exception for the Solara, I really think that it is very beautiful automobile and it is sure fun to drive in it.

The cargo volume in the trunk is at 13.8 cubic feet of volume.

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

Driving the Solara convertible on a beautiful sunny morning, was a great pleasure. Since I have known the owner of that dealership for quite a long time I asked if I could take it an extended ride and he agreed so I did.

When shopping around for a convertible you have to take a long look at the Solara, it is well worth it.
