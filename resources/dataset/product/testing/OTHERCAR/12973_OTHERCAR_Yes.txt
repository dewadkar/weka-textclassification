            I've read the initial review and I must say that the author did a great job. Although some facts like the original asking price for example were incorrect I think his review was well done accurate and honest considering he's not an owner. He certainly did his homework. 
Now let's talk 850. 
When You see one of these cars in the metal I guarantee that you will see and understand why I get positive comments and questions about the car every day. Everyday! I agree that without the CSI nose treatment the car looks dated, but with it I think it's BMW's second most attractive design ever. (2nd to Z8 in looks) 
When I hear negative comments about the car I think people are judging the car against todays performance and today technology and no it doesn't compare. But when you consider that this car was designed in the LATE EIGHTIES. Traction control, airbags, abs, light sensitive rearview mirrors, heated seats unique halogen, headlight design, ect... the list is endless. Thats more features than your car probably has today and better performance 0 to 60 and top speed. The people who could afford this car weren't concerned with trivial things like gas mileage. Like a Ferrari it was more like if you have to ask you couldn't afford it. That was part of the prestige and novelty. This is not your teenage hot rod, a wise economical family buy or your average luxury car. It's much more. Buying a used one is really where you get to appreciate it's beauty. The 90k to 100k price tag is gone. As a used car you pay a decent price if you can find one. 
This is a true introductory to the otherwise out of reach class known as Gran Touring Cruisers. These types of cars are usually V8"s and V12's are are only driven by the rich. 
No it's not a 348 light fast and expensive it's more like the Aston Martin is today:

No it's not the fastest, yes It's large even obese but that is part of it's impressive beauty. 
Yes it was expensive but nowadays for much less money you can experience Rock Star Affluent quality in a very rare very well built machine. 
When I bought my first one I had driven 911's and had owned 5 other Bmw's. 
This driving experience was nothing like those. Much more comfort and control a much better feel. As though you are behind the wheel of a finely built machine. No car I've driven including the 928 or any Merc. of the Era gives a parralled feel. 
Just think, ten years later and my BMW is still quicker than most BM's and has a Higher top range acceleration and top end. You feel like a king when you drive this car. With a V12 on the road in a sense you are. 
If you don't like the look then maybe you should revisit it and compare this car for comfort, quality, prestige, and performance against any car it's age even a Ferrari Modial or 348.

For the money, if you have money there is no competion out there for this car. This is not a cheap car. You have to have a little money to own and maintain a car like this. This is a Man's Man's Car. 
This beast is still the king of the road. Without the CSI front airdam treatment the car does look a little out of style, but with it like it looks in the links that I have posted to my car, I'm still asked even by BMW owners if it's the new BMW. Pull into a gas station and become a celebrity. Rice rockets will be intimidated when they see that V12 Badge and want to race you but this is no racer. It's a statley gentleman. Women will want to know just who owns that car. Think Bond. I know it sound silly but test drive one and go to a populated gas station and see what I mean. 
Much more than a used car, and introduction to a higher standard of driving. 
Really!

Not for everybody! 
Own one and you won't be satisfied with any other average car ever again. 

Owner!
