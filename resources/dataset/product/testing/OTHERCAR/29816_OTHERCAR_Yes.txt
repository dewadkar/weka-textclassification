            I'm a clinical massage therapist writing a textbook with a medical illustrator and a photographer; the book is to be heavily illustrated with color photos. Although the photos for the book are being done with film, we reasoned that a digital camera would enable us to check composition and lighting before shooting with film. In addition, I do postural therapy and take photos of clients; a digital camera would allow me to have photos immediately, without violation of the client's privacy involved in having film processed.

We chose the Kodak DC260 from other cameras in its quality range because it was the only one we found that had a hot shoe (ability to connect to a synchronized external flash system).

The camera makes fairly good pictures, although it has to be held very steady (it works best with a tripod). But it has some distinct limitations:

1) It stores pictures on a flash card of up to 38 megabytes, or downloads via a USB port or serially to a PC. My PC has a USB port, and I can download very quickly, but my illustrator and photographer have Macs without USB ports. The only way they can download photos is with a card reader ï¿½ an extra expense, and the one my illustrator bought failed after short use. The camera is well-attuned to PC use; not so well to Mac use.

2) It takes a very long time to process between pictures. This makes for an awkward wait between shots when I am taking posture photos. It is supposed to have a burst mode (several photos in quick succession), but that feature has never worked.

3) Even when plugged in through the adapter, the camera will not function when the batteries are too low. If you don't watch battery level carefully, you can find yourself suddenly without a functioning camera.<br><br>
