            Oldsmobile has been on an advertising blitz lately.  Turn on the tube during primetime and you're bound to see one of their ads.  The commercials for the Intrigue are probably the ones most often run.  The commercials would have you believe the Intrigue is a world class car.  Is it?  Read on.

When it comes to buying cars, I'm fairly loyal to American brands.  I know that dollar-for-dollar, American cars often come up short compared to their competitors from Europe and Japan.  But as a resident of Michigan--and with many family members and friends employed the GM and Ford--I try to keep my wallet pointed toward Motown.

When I first saw the Intrigue on TV, I was wowed.  When I first saw it in person, I was even more impressed.  This relatively large sports sedan (larger than most--if not all--of its competition) looked a lot smaller than it actually is.  It sits low and wide with curves and flares in all the right places.  Particularly attractive are the &quot;fender flares&quot; that give the Intrigue a wonderful, aggressive appearance.  Long story short:  there is not a bad angle from which to view an Intrigue.  In my opinion, it may be one of the best-looking sedans in the last several years.  It is bold without being too radical or too unconventional--quite a timeless design.

Looks are one thing, though.  Driving is another.  In the market for a new car, I wanted to be sure to give the Intrigue a test drive to make sure there was some dash to accompany the flash.  Simply put, the Intrigue drives just as it looks--darned good.  One of the areas that American cars have improved exponentially in the last five model years is structural rigidity.  The Intrigue is a perfect example of this, feeling as though it was shaped from a solid billet, with no squeaks or rattles, and, most importantly, tracking through twists and turns with nary a hint of structural flex.  The suspension is also excellent, with very little body roll through even the most severe turns, whilst not giving up any ride comfort in the least.  Test drive one and you'll be surprised you're in an American car.

Though the Intrigue's engine is fairly refined, it is still not up to the refinement standards of Honda or Toyota.  It's quiet at idle, and remarkably quiet at freeway speeds.  It's just not as silky-smooth under hard acceleration as the finer Japanese engines.

The interior appointments are very nice.  Opt for leather.  The instrument panel is up to European/Japanese standards in terms of layout, but doesn't exhibit the more expensive refinement of the European/Japanese competitors, especially around the center console area.  The beefy steering wheel is a joy to work with.  The seats are comfortable, with a firm, relatively supportive feel and good lumbar support--not as bolstered as a 3-series BMW's seat, but still very nice.  The Intrigue's cabin is quiet at any speed--almost no wind noise, very minimal road noise, but, at the same time, not too isolating.  In terms of noise level, think 5-series BMW (definitely not Lexus LS400 quiet, though).

So did I go with the Intrigue?  You bet!  Fully loaded, in black with the chrome wheels, and she's a beauty.  Is it world class?  Well, that's hard to answer.  In its price range, definitely.  With a GM discount (my father works there), I paid around $24,000 for mine.

The commercials would have you believe the Intrigue is quite the supercar.  In its price range, it really is.  If, like me, you have an American car brand bias, it may be the best in its price range.<br><br>
