            Lexus ES 300, 2001

Another Lexus Winner

The Lexus ES 300 is as basic as a Luxury automobile can get, but it will still give you a smooth and comfortable ride. It has very few standard features and the ones it does come with are all someone really needs unless you want your car to be a toy.

For 2001, Lexus made very few changes on the ES from the previous year model. The major difference is that they have equipped the 2001 ES with high-intensity discharge headlights.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The Lexus ES 300 is a beautiful car in and out. The exterior has a very nice line and every thing about it is all proportionate. The one I drove had a sunroof, on a sunny day it made all the difference between just a drive around and a fun ride in nature.

THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR

The interior:

The Lexus ES 300 offers drivers lots of head, leg and shoulder space, it would be an excellent choice for anyone who is oversized and is looking for room so not to feel too cramped-in.  

The all-around vision in this car is excellent, I particularly like the side-view mirror, they will give a minimal dead spot and the rear window is wide enough to give you a panoramic view of on coming traffic. This is always something I look for in a car. How good is the rear and side view of the traffic behind.

The interior is very well made, at the risk of repeating myself; it is what one would expect from Lexus quality material and workmanship.

All the gages can easily be seen from the driver&#146s position and all the controls and buttons are within easy reach.

The standard equipment the ES 300 come with is very basic but also quite complete. You will have as standard equipment the following: Automatic Climate control, cruise control, power doors and windows, front power-heated seats, AM/FM cassette stereo with a CD changer, keyless remote entry and tilt steering.

Also included is a variety of standard safety equipment listed in the features below.   

The exterior:

I really like the exterior look of this automobile. Everything is proportionate; it also has excellent rear side-view mirrors and classy looking alloy wheels.

Another thing I like is the size of the trunk, in this one you can put a little more than your lunch bag. The trunk space will give you almost 13 cubic feet for cargo and equipment.

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE  

The Lexus Es 300 is a great car to drive, it reminded me of an old Mark V, I once owned.  It was very basic, so basic it did not even have leather seats, but I never complained about the smooth ride with the Mark and no one should about the ride in this car also.
