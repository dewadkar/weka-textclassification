            I purchased the Astro for its size. We are a family of 7 and need the space. It is also small enough to fit in our garage.

I like the performance of the van. The fuel economy is around 22 mpg. The quality of the interior is poor, it has been falling apart since we bought it. The exterior paint is the thinnest paint I have ever seen on a new vehicle. It scratches very easily! Our is red, I would recommend white. Because all the scratches show white. It is also very difficult to keep aligned.

It has been reliable so far. We have 55k miles on it. We bought it used with 40k.

The van is a good riding van. We  had a '90 Caravan prior to the Astro and the rides equal.

I would recommend this van to anyone who needs the seating and the ability to garage.
