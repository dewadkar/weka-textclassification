About 2 1/2 months ago, my 1995 extended cab S-10 4X4 decided to self-destruct after about 86,000 miles.  This is my second bad experience with an S-10 and I will never buy a Chevrolet again. I use four wheel drive trucks to haul items purchased at auctions for resale at a consignment shop and as transportation to work.  Due to very slippery wintry roads, I consider four wheel drive a necessity.  I do not engage in off the road driving or four wheeling.  My wife was interested in the new Frontier four door and this led us to the local Nissan dealer (who also sells Chevrolets).  When my wife saw this truck, it was love at first sight.  It is a color called Silver Ice and is a head turner.

Pros:

1. Competitive price for a fully loaded pickup.  Nissan had a $1,000 rebate on this model; and the dealer gave me an excellent price for my S-10.  My overall trade-in price was equal to competing 1999 models with a lesser sticker price and lesser equipment.
2. The bed is slightly larger than other competing models.
3. We have found the ride to be comfortable and reasonably quiet.
4. Nissans have step rails that I really like.  This allows me easy access to the back of the bed (I am 5'9&quot; tall).  There is one disadvantage to the rails in that you must be careful in getting out of the truck or you can get dirt on the back of your legs or pants from rubbing on the rails.
5. Good stereo with both cassette and CD plus a subwoofer.    This is the first vehicle that I have had with a CD player and I am pleasantly surprised how good it sounds.
6. Fit and finish.  The paint is perfect.
7. Handling and short turning radius.
8. Ground clearance is very good and this truck comes with 16 inch tires.
9. The dealership went the extra mile to insure our buying this vehicle by finding the lowest available financing.  It was 1/2% lower than the rates I was able to find on my own.

Cons:

1. Low horsepower.  The Nissan has 170 horsepower and may be a little under powered for off-road use.  I have driven this vehicle on Interstates and it does slow going up hills (70 mph speed limit); but it has plenty of power for my style of driving.
2. Limited area behind the front seats--only a small child could fit back there.  I worry about passenger safety on compact king cabs and so I actually like the fact that no one will fit back there.  We use the area for groceries, etc.  Access for loading groceries or other small items is not good.  Nissan should consider doing away with the seats and adding a third door.
3. Poor visibility to the passenger side rear.   Be careful when making left turns at intersections in this vehicle.
4. Lack of oil pressure gauge and alternator gauge.
5. A parking brake system that looks like it came out of a '40s model car.  You pull a handle out of the dash.
6. The tires are of a slick tread design and are all season radials.  If you are going to use this for off-road use, be prepared to spend extra money for a set of all terrain radials.  I have driven four wheel drives off-road in my job for the last thirty years.  The tires on this truck will not get you very far off road.
7. The cruise control switch is on the lower left portion of the dash and is hard to locate without looking for it.  It would be much better on the steering wheel with the other cruise controls.
8. If you smoke, this truck does not come with a cigarette lighter--it is an option.  I smoke, but I have promised my wife that I will not smoke in this truck; so I don't miss the lighter at all.
9. The four wheel drive system is a low speed shift on the fly system with automatic locking hubs.  To shift into four wheel drive, you must be traveling at a speed of less than 25 mph.  This is a serious flaw on patchy snow and ice covered roads.  
10. Mediocre gas mileage.  The EPA figures of 15 City, 18 Highway are right on.


Overall, I like this truck.  The Nissan is simply not as refined as the competition.  If your driving requires shifting into and out of four wheel drive, take note of the low speed requirement for shifting into four wheel drive.
