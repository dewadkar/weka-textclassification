            I do not own a dodge caravan or a minivan for that matter put last year my husband and I did rent one for two weeks. The van handle very nicely and gets great gas milliage and it is very comportable for a large family. I have two children 4 and 7 months, when we rented the van they were 3 and 6 weeks, my three year loved the van she thought that it was so cool to sit all the way in the back far away from mom and dad. That was my problem with the van My child can not buckle her own seat belt so everytime we got in the car I had to climb all the way in the back just to buckle her up and after awhile it got to be kind of a pain! It might not have been so bad if I didnt have a 6 week old but getting in and out of three different doors just to get my family to wal mart was a big waste of time. The dodge caravan is a great car for a family or who ever likes it but as for me I will wait until all of my kids are a little bit bigger!<br><br>
