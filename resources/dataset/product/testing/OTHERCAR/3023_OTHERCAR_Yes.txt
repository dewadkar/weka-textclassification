            Digital photography has became quite popular in a last few years as pricing of an average digital camera has fallen down considerably and the selection of equipment as well as host of features that comes with such equipment, has greatly increased.

If you are looking for a digital camera, selection and price range of cameras available to you, as mentioned previously, is quite large. Thus, the proper research and ability to compare models, are quite important if you are looking to be satisfied with your purchase and not just have purchased a very expensive toy to be sitting on the shelf, with the rest of things you once thought were great, but have soon after purchasing discovered that they are not all that you thought they are.

Canon Powershot Pro90 IS Digital Camera is one of models you should take a look at if you are serious about purchasing a digital camera. It is a great, quality built unit with fair amount of features and a good selection of the accompanying software.

The first notable thing about this model is a quite powerful 10x 7-70mm optical zoom (equivalent to a 37-370 mm of a standard 35mm camera). This is quite powerful if you are trying to take a close up shoot of a distant object.

The unit furthermore, offers electronic image stabilization (EIS) function that will allow you to stabilize the image you are taking a picture of, before taking a snapshot of it. I have found this feature when zooming distant scenery (taking a close up pictures of a far away object). Although you can not entirely stabilize your camera when the above is the case, the EIS function allowed me to stabilize it to a much greater extent than by not using this function.

Additionally, the unit comes with red eye reduction to eliminate red eye effects (if you ever took a few pictures you know what I am talking about).

As far as capacity and format supported, this unit is quite strong. The average battery life is about an hour (which should be enough for you to take quite a few snapshots before you have to recharge. The battery that the unit uses by itself is the Lithium Ion pack (will not take alkaline and generic batteries).

One of disadvantages, I have found with this unit's batteries, is the inability to use anything but the original Canon replacement batteries for this specific model (does not take any generic batteries), but as I have mentioned previously, I have found the capacity of the battery (one hour) to be fair when it comes to how many pictures you can take before the need to recharge.

The camera is capable of taking an image of anything of 2.6 to 3.3 mega pixels (even though the camera has an option of capturing the full 3.3 mega pixels, the 10x zoom mode utilizes only 2.6 mega pixels, due to its architecture limitations) in quality (up to 3.34 million pixels).

The flash card is not that bad either, but if you need something with higher storage capacity, you might look at IBM MicroDrive (used to store up to 3000 pictures (depending on a resolution and a file size you select for your images) in a JPG format. However, this option does not come cheap, but if you really need it and if you can afford it, this is definitely an accessory to be added to your Canon PowerShot Pro90 IS.   

I have found the above capacity and quality of images stored more than adequate for even most enthusiastic shutterbug. I have sold quite few of those units since they first became available and overall am glad to report that majority of my customers agreed with me on the above comments (regarding the quality and storage capacity of this unit).

As far as esthetics of this unit is concerned, the unit incorporates somewhat novel design unlike anything you might have seen in a past when it comes to digital cameras.
Positions of buttons are somewhat awkward at the beginning but you should become quite accustomed with it in a short period of time (at least most of my customers did). The unit, furthermore, comes with 1.8" foldable swivel LCD (somewhat smaller than on some other models but still highly functional) capable of swiveling a full 270 degrees for optimum usability and a.44" color LCD viewfinder that tells you exactly what borders of your images are and what is or is not caught on the picture.

I have found this design quite adequate unless you are shooting in dark/low light where I have found the LCD viewfinder (rather than a full-fledged conventional viewfinder) not performing to its best (can't quite see what you are shooting). Rather than this, I have not found or have not been told by my customers of any other disadvantage of this camera.

The unit, additionally, comes with a built in pop-up flash that is quite powerful when it comes to taking images in dark and light depleted environments. Furthermore, in addition to the pop up flash, the unit comes with an option of adding an external flash (available as extra accessory through Canon) for those situations where the built in flash is not powerful enough.

As far as picture taking, the unit is quite versatile for use from novice to most expert user, allowing you to use a full auto focus or manually focus and tweak the camera to your own specifications. Thus no matter if you are a novice or an expert user, you will find this camera capable and quite suitable for your photography projects.

Furthermore to the above, the camera uses the standard USB interface for transferring your images to your computer and host of other functions that are capable to you when you combine your camera with your PC (remote capture and operation of camera through your PC and much more). 

As far as software that comes with the camera, it is quite good selection to play with your images once you have taken them. The software suite that comes with it allows you to quickly enhance quality of your images, edit it and add special effects (stitch two or more images) and much more as well as to organize your images and quickly export them to your printer or upload them to web. 

Overall, this is quite a nice piece of equipment that I highly recommend (functional with fair number of features) that you will enjoy and play with for a long time, and definitely worth doing more research on. If you are interested in this model and want to learn more about it (including a full list of features offered through this model, technical specifications of this model, and any other information you might need), I would highly recommend you taking a look at this product's brochure that is available at:
