            My father just bought this car a couple of weeks ago.  It is just a beautiful car, a sparkling silver color.  Perfect for a graduation gift this spring, dad!  Hehe, yeah right.

I have driven this car many times since my father got it and he has commented on many aspects of the car, good and bad.  I hope I can do justice to this awe-inspiring car.  It really is a sexy car.  Looking at this car makes my knees week! ;-)

<b>Engine</b>

This car has an excellent engine.  When you first start up the car the engine purrs softly until it has warmed up.  Once the engine is warm and idling it is almost silent.  But when the pedal hits the metal the engine growls to life with a deep throaty tone that makes my heart pound.  Cheesy but true!  The 4.3 V8 powerplant provides strong torque and will put you back in your seat on takeoff.  The engine puts out 275 horsepower which allows this car to hit 60 mph in under 7.0 seconds, probably around 6.5 if driven in the right hands.  We have recorded approximately 23 MPG, not bad for a V8 but I think Mercedes could improve this number.

One thing I don't like about this car is that it runs premium octane gasoline.  A lot of people probably ask why someone who is willing to spend this kind of money on a car would worry about paying for high grade gas.  No one, with any sense, wants to spend more money for little benefit.  Several luxury cars now days take lower grade octane.

The five speed automatic is smooth and responds well under heavy acceleration.  In fact the shifts are as smooth as any car I have ever driven.

<b>Ride Quality</b>

This car rides well but there are a couple of problems I didn't expect in a high-end luxury car.  I would describe the ride as firm.  It glides over all but the most drastic road hazards.  In the corners this Mercedes is agile and tight.  Don't be fooled into thinking this is a true sports car.  This is a luxury car with sport-touring manners.  People looking for a sporty luxury car in the same price range should look toward the BMW 3 class and especially the M3.  While I haven't noticed my father has commented on several occasions that the body roll is pretty dramatic.

When you do hit a large pothole or bump the car does react in an accordingly, thumping sharply.  Momentarily you forget that you are driving a high-end car.  The feeling returns quickly, however, so don't worry.

The disc brakes are nice and stiff.  Under hard breaking I have not had any surprises and the car stays straight.  This car will stop on a dime.

<b>Interior</b>

I like the comfortable interior of this car.  I would not call it plush like the more expensive Benz models but it outshines all other cars in this class.  One problem I have with the interior is that some of the trim pieces feel kind of cheap.  I am comparing this to the Benz E class, a much more expensive class.  Obviously you aren't going to get the same quality for this price but I would expect a little more of a solid and quality feel.

I have heard from other owners of this car that there are rattles in the dashboard when riding over a rough road.  I have not experienced this nor has my father so I cannot comment on it.  It is hard to believe that all of these rumors are totally false, however, so buyer beware.

<b>Extras</b>

We paid an absurd price for the xenon headlights lights but they are really worth it.  They put out the most amount of usable life.  I have heard some people say these lights are bothersome to other drivers but I have never had a problem with other cars with xenon headlights approaching me.

The trunk is large and spacious compared to a lot of other cars in this class including the BMW 3 class.  It isn't as large as the E class but it isn't as expensive either.

I have been told that the standard tires, Continental I believe, wear out quicker than they should.  Replacing the tires with a more sporty design would increase wear and performance and would be the first upgrade I recommend.

The Bose radio system is average.  I have heard better sound from almost stock BMW 3's.  This would be the next upgrade I recommend.

<b>Conclusion</b>

This is one hot car.  Yeah I know it isn't an E class but it doesn't cost $65,000 either.  You get what you pay for and this car certainly gives you a lot of bang for your buck.  It is a stylish looking car that evokes looks wherever you travel.  The acceleration is hard and fast, just the way I like it!  Handling is smooth and responsive, even at 110 MPH, where I topped the car out.  The only problems I have with this car are that the interior could be improved upon, even for this price Mercedes could improve in this area.  The other problem I have is that I do not get to drive this car enough!  This is one sexy car for those who enjoy performance, luxury, and lusty looks.  Two thumbs up!  Buy me my own and I'll be your Valentine!
