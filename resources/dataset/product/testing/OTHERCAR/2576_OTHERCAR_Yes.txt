Honda is a badge that holds itself to much pride and enginerring dignity. It is a symbol that intices both the power enthusiast as much as it pleases those that demand reliability. 
The prelude is no exception to this.
Built as a head turner, the 4th gen Prelude is stylish and swift.
The body comprises of sleek aerodynamic folds which are almost cheeky in their attributes. The interior styling is abstract and retro, yet confident enough to enginte the sports driver in all of us.
The engine a 2.3 litre Dohc, Naturally aspirated which provides the prelude with 160 hp at your foot. The car is moderately weighted at 1.2 tn, making its weight to power ratio just nice. personal performace figures have seen this car as stock reach 0-60miles in around 7.5 sec. Adding a exhaust inc the cat, manifold and air filter, will see results as impressive as 6.5 sec.

Handleing is very good for a front wheel, however the car tends to understeer and often hydroplane in very wet conditions.

Damage control is where is car folds and can leave you crying poor. repairs are expensive and spare parts not always available. be careful not to have too many side impacts that will trigger the airbag. Its costly and can chute in times when it really isnt needed.
As a first car the Prelude is a high quality, fast, comfortable, reliant and fun car to enjoy. An all round good guy.
