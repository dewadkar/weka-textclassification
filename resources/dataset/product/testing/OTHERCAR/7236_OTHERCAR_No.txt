            If you want a hot lookin' date for the prom, then these are your wheels.  If you want your date to have personality, soul and provide you with everything you need, then move on to the next car dealer!

I was first attracted to the Mercury Cougar because of its eye catching lines, sloped body and sexy appearance.  But a test drive of only a few miles can tell you only so much.  When out on the road the acceleration is sluggish at best, making a quick merge onto the highway a heart stopping experience every time.  Combined with a temperamental transmission which seems to be on a time delay before it kicks in, rabbit like starts are nowhere to be found.

The leg room in the back seats is nonexistent but that has nevered bothered me as I never intend to sit back there.  For those who must, the seats are deeply bucketed and have comfortable support.  Trunk room is more than adequate and the fold down seats give added room when needed.

Summation -- if you just want to drive to the mall and back and illicit jealous stares from minivan owners, then the Cougar will suffice.  If you're looking for the muscle to back the looks, check out my last car, the Mitsubishi Eclipse.<br><br>
