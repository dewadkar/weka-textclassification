                 I bought this camera after studying about a lot of digital cameras. The fact that the pictures are put on the 3 1/2&quot; floppy disk make it so extremely easy to use. Just pop the disk into your computer and get your photos right up on the screen without having to connect the camera to the computer. 
     Many people want a higher resolution camera, but for the internet the lower resolution is perfect. The lower resolution didn't stop a former customer (who used this camera) from putting very detailed medical equipment pictures on the Internet. I put a lot of items on Ebay and The photos load quicker because you can save your photo as .jpg. You can also set the camera to take a normal picture or save your photo as a bitmap with the touch of a button. My Ebay pictures are .jpgs, but I take normal photos of homes for my real estate marketing. 
     I have saved a LOT of time and I have gotten my clients homes marketed much faster than waiting for processing. You still have to make two trips to the 1-hour processing store. 
     Being able to look at the pictures you have just taken helps you know if you need to reshoot. Just reformat or clear the disk and shoot again. 
     There seem to be many more features that I haven't learned about yet, such as black &amp; white, and sepia tone. This is a good camera for the money. You can get more features and better resolution with other cameras, but you will pay more, too. At $499, this was a very good investment.<br><br>
