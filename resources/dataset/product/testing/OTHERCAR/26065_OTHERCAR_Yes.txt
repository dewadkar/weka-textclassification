            I bought the Protege in February of '99.  I'd driven my friend's '95 Protege and really enjoyed it.  The handling was great; the car was comfortable to drive and there hadn't been a single problem with the car since she'd bought it.  Before buying my Protege, I looked at other cars in the same price range, but given the history I had with the Mazda, it wasn't a tough choice.  Three days after buying the car in Connecticut I loaded it to the gills with stuff and drove to Tennessee and then to Utah.  The car handled perfectly.  There was no hesitation pulling onto interstates and when braking the car held straight and true.  The Protege held it's speed with no problem and didn't seem to be blown around by the eighteen wheelers. This past August, I drove back to Connecticut and then back to Utah, filling it with more stuff.  Finally, this winter, I moved back to the East Coast once again with the Mazda loaded with stuff!  Not a problem!  The car handled exactly like the first time I drove cross-country even in a snowstorm.  I love everything about my Protege; the size, the handling, the fact that I can load my life in the car and drive from one side of the country without a hitch.  The only thing about the car is the color...there's a lot of construction in Utah and the road dust shows up on the dark blue.  I would say that this car is perfect for anyone, whether they are single or have a family.  Since moving back to Connecticut, I drive my neices around alot and it's easy to get the two-year old in the back-seat carseat without a lot of fuss.  It's reliable, fun and great to drive.  Love my Mazda Protege!<br><br>
