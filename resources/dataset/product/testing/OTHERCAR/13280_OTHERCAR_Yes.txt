            The new Honda Accord is, in my opinions the greatest car on the road today, no wonder why it is one of the most driven cars in America. The Accord holds the road like no other, this is especially true if you nail your tires to the ground, but then, the car probably wont drive very well

The comfortable seating in the accord feels as if you are sitting on air, well, not EXACTLY like sitting on air, if you were to sit on air you would fall down, but i think you know what i am talking about.

The best part about this car is the roominess, there is enough room to have a party in the back seat, but I would not suggest that, because if a policeman saw you having a party in the back seat of your car, no matter how roomy it is, you might get in a little trouble.

I hope my opinion helped, and dont forget to recommend my opinion. Thanks
