            Having used my DC-265 avidly for the past six months, I've been pleased with the image quality - you'll be hard pressed to find a better combination of megapixel resolution, lens quality (including physical zoom), and color balance quality in this price range.  

While I have no hesitations in recommending this product as a great digital camera for mid-range users, I have encountered a few frustrations that some prospective buyers may want to keep in mind:

- Physical bulk.  This camera (and all its related Kodak DC product family  members) is substantially bigger than most other consumer-oriented digital cameras and 35mm point-and-shoot models, because it requires space for 4 AA batteries (rather than a built-in rechargeable cell or regular camera batteries).  This camera won't fit in your pocket, and it won't fit in most standard compact camera cases either.  I've found it somewhat cumbersome to tote around when in sightseeing mode.  If size is an important consideration, I would also take a look at the Sony CyberShot - same price range, approximately same image quality, but much smaller form factor (one downside is that the Sony has no physical zoom)

- Short battery life.  This camera devours AA batteries.  On average, it will shoot &lt;100 images - without flash - before squawking for new batteries.  I'm surprised Kodak wasn't able to adapt the more efficient (and more compact) rechargeable cell technology used by most competitors.

- Extraneous features.  This camera comes with a number of &quot;nice-to-have&quot; extra features that, in my view, add limited practical value while complicating the interface considerably.  I so far have yet to use over half the features on this camera - such as voice recording, creating albums  (with the relatively limited storage capacity of the flash card, I have to think most users would transfer their images to hard disk storage rather than creating and managing photo albums directly on the camera)

Those caveats aside, this camera should be a good bet for personal or business-quality digital photography.
