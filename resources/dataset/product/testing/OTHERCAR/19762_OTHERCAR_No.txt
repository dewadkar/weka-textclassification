            We bought a new Honda Accord LX and Mazda 626 4 cyl LX (both automatics) at the same time in early 1998.  So far, there has been two recalls on the 626.  One was a potential electrical short of the radio from the above air vents.  Next, came the timing belt tensioner (potential to break!).  The latest one took over a month to fix.  Door seals started to fall off at 20K!  Dealer wouldn't fix it, citing &quot;normal wear&quot;.  How many other cars have seals falling off at 20K?  Now my transmission failed at 47K.  Looking at the discussion groups, many many many others have had similar transmission problems on 626s.  You will hear of individuals having to replace the transmission 1-3 times ($1500 - $3000 a pop).  Obviously Mazda is not doing its job on quality control.  The transmission problems date back to the early 90s.  

Our Accord has been a rock at 70K.  Absolutely no problems with it.  

The 626 itself is very beautiful with nice curves.  The ride is much smoother than the Accord.  The sound system is also much nicer.  I actually  prefer to drive the 626 over the Accord.  But what a sorry transmission!  <br><br>
