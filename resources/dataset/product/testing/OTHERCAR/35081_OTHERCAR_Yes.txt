            The best investment i have ever made in me 40 years fo safe driving was to purchase a 94 dodge caravan. The greatest and safest vehicle in the world in my eyes. You cant beat this vehicle for family trips and vacations plenty of room and comfort for the entire family. You get great gas mileage local and highway. Of course like anything in this world to maintain the value and cost savings maintenance is important. A twenty dollar oil and filter change will help keep your automobile running longer. IN my opinion the dodge caravan pound for pound is the best family investment for the long haul. One of the highest in resale value making driving enjoyable for the whole family.<br><br>
