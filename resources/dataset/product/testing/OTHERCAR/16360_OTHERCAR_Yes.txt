            The pictures are outstanding. I use the camera also, in order to archive my color slides. Operates great. The pictures with mid accuracy are sufficient - with this the camera can store 40 pictures. The loading time into the computer lasts for a very long time, but that is not a problem, if you have the P1000 printer, because that one can read the Flash cards. A little problematic is the handling: Some functions (zoom, brightness, etc..) can only be adjusted over the menu in the color display, others over the display above at the camera. On the whole a super camera. I enjoy it much. The purchase was worthwhile itself in any case.
