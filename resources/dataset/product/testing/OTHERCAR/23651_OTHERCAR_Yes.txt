            The Fujifilm FinePix 2650 is a very nice camera.  This was my second digital camera (my first one got stolen), and before I bought it, I wanted to buy one that had a good value, and a small size without making it less powerful.  I would definetly say that this is a very good personal or family camera.  There were some features that attracted me immediatley to the camera:

1) Display screen and viewfinder
      This allowed me the option to use the color display screen to veiw and record pictures, or use the veiwfinder to take pictures to save battery life.

2) Two Megapixel resolution.  
     This was the perfect resolution for me:  it allowed me to create pictures at photo quality up to a size of 8"x8".  

3) Built on lens cover.
     Most cameras dont have a built on lens cover, and this feature really made me like the camera.  instead of always hanging from a string and getting  in your way, this just slides to the side, making it very comfortable taking pictures.  Some cameras dont even have lens covers at all, they're just asking to get scratched.

4) Picture card XD.
     A new type of memory chip that is smaller, has faster upload and download speeds, and will have a future capacity of around 3 gigabytes!  Thats a lot of pictures.

5) Normal batterys
     Instead of buying extremely expensive photo batterys, you can just buy two rechargeable AA batterys and use them forever.

Now the Cons:

1)Eats batterys
     This is a battery eating camera.  Sometimes, I only get about 3 hours on two AA.  If you carry around two rechargable batteries in the camera, and two spares, you won't have a problem.

2) Poor flash.
    Even though this camera packs great picture quality for such a good price, the flash is bottom of the line.  A lot of times, pictures come out darker than they should, other times, they come out brighter.  The flash is a little kooky.

3)  Somewhat inaccurate veiwfinder.
     Several other owners of this camera that I know and I have had little problems with the viewfinder.  It seems as if the veiwfinder is a little more zoomed in than the lens, so what you see in the veiwfinder will always be a little closer than what will actually come out as the picture.
