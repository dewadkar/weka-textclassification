            This new Miata was redesigned in 1998, and has continued to slowly evolve ever since.  What remains is still a lightweight, fun-to-drive sports roadster that was never intended to be an everyday car.

<b>EXTERIOR</b>: The new Miata's styling is very muscular, yet sporty at the same time.  I prefer this body style as opposed to the original Miata.  The optional 16-inch wheels and tires may sound small, but they fill up the wheelwells making the car look fast even while standing still.  There are also optional ground effects for an extra $800, but the money is well worth it.

<b>INTERIOR</b>: Engine, wind, and tire noise is low enough for me to keep a normal conversation with the top down (and the windows up) even at 55 mph.  The guages and controls I think look very sporty.  If you're about 6-feet tall, you'll have just enough head and leg room.  Leather upholstery is standard on the LS model, optional on the base.  I have a ton of CD's and the fact that the Miata comes standard with a CD player (optional cassette and CD player) makes the car even more desirable.

<b>ENGINE</b>: The sole engine option in the Miata is a miniscule 1.8-liter inline 4-cylinder engine.  It produces 142 horsepower at its 7,000 rpm redline, and its peak torque, 125 lb./ft., arrives at 5,500 rpm.  Though I feel it does not have a lot of low-end torque based on the numbers, when you actually drive it, it feels powerful all throughout the rev range.  This is mainly due to the fact that it weighs only 2,387 pounds.  There are 3 different transmission options to choose from.  A standard 5-speed manual transmission, and an optional super-close ratio 6-speed manual transmission, though I would NOT recommend the latter for everyday use.  Also optional is a 4-speed automatic, which is the best choice if you plan on using a Miata everyday.  If you plan on using an automatic, be aware that it is not available with a limited-slip differential.  I averaged a thrifty 27.2 mpg on the recommended premium fuel.

<b>HANDLING</b>: Put it this way, I feel that there are very few cars out there (for this price) that feel as connected to the road as the Miata.  When I say it handles, I mean this thing can handle!  Point it where you want to go and it's already there.  The 16-inch tires should be noticeably "stickier" than the standard 15-inchers.  Anti-lock brakes, an essential safety feature is optional...not what I would expect in a car that when fully loaded can reach upwards of $27,000!

<b>RIDE</b>: Ride?  Who cares about ride quality in a car like this?  Well, if you must know anyway, the base suspension should be firm but not too firm.  The optional suspension package is an entirely different story however.  I would not recommend you spend the extra $1,025 ($325 if you have the LS model) unless you only drive the Miata on the weekend or plan on racing it in an autocross.  I feel the ride is too harsh for everyday driving conditions.  Try it before you buy it!

<b>RELIABILITY</b>: Mazda builds very reliable cars, and now that Ford has control of Mazda, I know the Miata will be virtually trouble free (due to Ford's financing).

<b>VALUE</b>: For your dollar, I would definitely recommend that you test drive the Miata as soon as possible.  Yes, new versions can cost as much as $27,000 when fully-loaded, but what you get in return is a neat little sports car that can hold it own against other sports cars costing nearly twice as much!
