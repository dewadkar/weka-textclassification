            Who would actually buy this piece of crap.  The new body style eliminates the only reason anyone would buy this car.  The old body style was the only reason I was ever interested in this car.  Now that they have butchered the appearance, there is no reason to waste your money on this car now.  The engine does not put out enough horsepower to compete with the 0-60 of the other cars in its class; such as the firebird and mustang.  If I were a consumer I would look towards another car which has higher engine output and much better appearance.  Several cars come to mind immediatly to me that are still in the same price range.  I would not reccomend this car to another consumer.  <br><br>
