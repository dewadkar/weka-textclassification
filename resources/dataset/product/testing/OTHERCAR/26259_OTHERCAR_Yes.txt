            What can I say I am a college student and work a part time job . Recently I had been going through cars left and right . Always having problems with them , either they mess up constantly or I was having problems with the dealers . I had a Ford Mustang GT and was reluctant in giving it up , but with the problems that continued I was forced into getting another vehicle . So I figured why not get a new car , My first one . I have always had an attraction to the civic but always thought the 1.6 was a tad bit on the small size for me , was I ever wrong . I purchased the 2000 Civic EX 2 door with the SOHC (Single Overhead Cam) VTECH motor . I am very impressed with its resposiveness and how well the motor runs . The engine runs smoothly through the RPMs and provides outstanding fuel economy even for us lead foots out there . Great manuverability , I can zig through a mall parking lot like nothing . To top it off the Civic passes my AC test !I live in Florida which is known for its particularly hot summers and AC is something that is sent from up above . The Civ (Which I call it)losses very little if at all any power with the AC running , this is seen in many other vehicles who makers shall remain nameless . Outstanding room and comfort as well as easy to reach controls , and the stereo rocks for a factory . The civ came with a 6 speaker stereo with cd player , and every friday night there is a party going on in the Civ . As for styling, the Civ provides sporty attitude with a slight dash of class . I would definitly recommend this vehicle to a first new car buyer , you can't go wrong . The people at the dealership were curtious and more than helpful . The dealer who helped me with my new car purchase PAUL SANDERS if you ever make it to Coggin Honda in JAX Florida , more or less ripped the car apart for me and showed me how everything worked and where things were located . I believe going to Honda has been the best decision that I have ever made . Those of you out there that are looking for a car that is for the family I would stay away from the 2 doors . Granted they have great room inside but they still can get cramped . <br><br>
