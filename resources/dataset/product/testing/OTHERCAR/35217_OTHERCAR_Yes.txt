            My husband and I bought a Toyota 4Runner in May.  We were looking for a SUV which is easy to drive and very reliable.  Toyota has this reputation - but, as previous Ford Exploder owners, we were loyal to Ford.  After test driving both vehicles, I found the 4Runner easier to handle - smooth turning, easy acceleration/braking, and good suspension.

My two favorite features of the 4Runner is the roll down back window and height clearance.  As dog owners, the roll down window is very important - the Toyota 4Runner is the only SUV with a this feature!  The height clearance is important because we actually do take the vehicle camping and often must drive through small rivers, rocks, and branches.  I believe the 4Runner's clearance is the highest of all SUVs.

While I was originally apprehensive about the height clearance because of where you're situated as a driver, I've found that the 4Runner is built with good 360 degree visibility - and therefore I feel safe driving such a large vehicle. 

We've been very happy with this purchase!<br>
