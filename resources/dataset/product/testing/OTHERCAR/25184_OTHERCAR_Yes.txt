             I bought a new 2000 Mazda Protege model dx, in February 2000. I initially wanted a different car but I was sold on the Protege as soon as I took the test drive. It features child safety locks, which is a must because I have three small children. 
 It also comes equipped with driver and passenger side airbags, so I feel very safe whenever I am riding it in. The ride is very smooth and quiet. The engine has an excellent get up and go power for the size. 
 It drives well in all driving conditions and it looks sleek, as I have gotten several comments on it. It looks like a lot of the pricier cars that cost several thousand more. I feel rich and proud of my Mazda. I believe that it is the best car for the price range, and I will definately buy another in the future. 
 Also, it come with a standard 5 year/ 50,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty which is more than most new cars come with. I would definately recommend this car to anyone especially families with young children, and as an added bonus it has a huge trunk space and fold down seats just like a hatch back, although it is not a hatchback. Happy driving.
 Followup, January 1, 2001: I am happy to report that this car handles great in winter driving conditions. I live in Oklahoma City and we have been hit with three winter storms consisting of snow, ice, sleet, and freezing rain (one storm each week for three weeks, very unusual for Oklahoma City). I have never been able to drive in bad weather (ended up in a ditch the two times that I had tried before. But not in my Mazda with standard transmission. I had to drive my twins to school on the first day that school was open after the first storm because it was their Christmas play (so I couldn't call and say that they wouldn't be in that day- I had to drive) My Mazda got us to school and back home safely, I observed several cars sliding but we didn't slide once. This car handled the roads like it was no big deal and I am very impressed.
 Also the car is one year old now and it still looks and drives as if it were brand new off the lot. The engine is still quiet and clean even though it has almost 14,000 miles on the odometer. I love this car and I am so glad that I was introduced to the Mazda Protege.<br><br>
