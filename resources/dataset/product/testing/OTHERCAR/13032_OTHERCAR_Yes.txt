            When I went shopping for my first luxury car, I decided that I wanted a "real" one, not a trimmed-up version of a low-end sedan.  That quickly limited the choice to BMW, top-end Lexus cars, Mercedes, and -- by the process of elimination -- eventually Volvo's S-80.  The S-80 is built on its own unique platform and has the heft in terms of features and size to qualify as a true luxury car.  The T-6 engine is also unique to the model and pours out gobs of power, particularly at the low end of the tach (torque peaks below 3000 RPM).  The S-80 is also much cheaper than the other cars and, at least on paper, looks the equal.  So why do I wish I had bitten the bullet and bought the BMW?  Probably because the S-80 isn't really special in any category, but merely competent in all.  It is not as fast as the BMW 540, does not handle as well as a BMW, and is not as luxurious as the Mercedes or Lexus.  Moreover, it lacks the quality control found in Japanese cars.  It is not a bad car, and I certainly wouldn't recommend against buying it if it was all one could afford.  However, if money is not a limitation, consider spending the extra bucks for one of the other cars until Volvo gets its act together.  The S-80 is not the ultimate driving machine, but it exceeds all the minimum requirements for a luxury car.  It is also "good enough" for older "sensible" drivers who want a basic luxury car and who really don't envision pushing the car's limits.  However, that is not exactly something to get excited about.
