            I purchased a Protege5 brand new in July of 2002.  Equipment included 5 speed manual, power sun roof, and side air bags.  As of August 2003, I have put 35K miles on it and have not yet had any problems.  The handling is exceptional, the power fits the size of the car while providing plenty of power for aggressive driving, and the shifting is firm and precise.  I highly recommend the manual transmission as I believe that the automatic trans. with this engine would be sluggish.  The seats are extremely comfortable, however I often get complaints from passengers that the ride is bumpy (a sacrifice for the great handling).  The ride in the driver's seat is very comfortable and I rarely notice bumpiness except on very poor roads.  There is a decent amount of road noise which I only notice when on my cell phone.  Otherwise, the stock stereo does a great job of covering that up.  The build quality on my car has been perfect both inside and out and I am very impressed with the materials and finish that were used.

Our other vehicle is a 2002 Mitsubishi Lancer OZ Rally 5spd. manual and, although it's a decent car, we have had it back to the dealer for several warranty repairs.  It does not have the same power (on paper it has more, but behind the wheel it feels sluggish) and the suspension handling is very soft.  The ride is more comfortable, but the build quality does not compare.  

I should also mention that we have a 3yr. old child and both cars have worked great for getting our family and all of the associated equipment around safely.
