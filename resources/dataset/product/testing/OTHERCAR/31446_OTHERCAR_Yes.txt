             My hubby and I went to a car lot one day looking around at chevy tahoe's and we look at a few and that is when my we saw our Jimmy today. It is a 1992 Green Jimmy 4x4 , 4 door. I just fell in love with it.My husband and I went a took a test drive in it , it was like heaven. It ran great, handled bumps and weaving in and out traffic great it handle itself real well. My husband and I bought it. We had a little trouble after the first week with it the heating element went out. I took it back to where we bought it from and the fixed it. I have not had any more problems with it at all. It rides real good , it has plenty of room, it handles well on long trip's. It has good highway mileage, And most of all it is all electric. I think people should get this type of truck . It is a good family car. It's a good light truck for making deliveries with. I believe it is sturdy and a dependable vehicle that everyone could benefit from. I think overweight, underweight, short or tall people could benefit from this truck. What I don't like about it is that the parts for all the electrical work is expensive. When you first drive and suv you will notice that you are sitting higher, and the view is great. At least when I get into a car sometimes i feel like I am on the ground dragging my butt. Family over 6 people should not buy this type of vehicles not enough Seats.<br><br>
