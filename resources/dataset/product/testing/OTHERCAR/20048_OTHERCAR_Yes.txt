            Funny thing is I had no intention on buying this vehicle....ORIGINALLY. We went in to the dealership, intending on test driving a roomy car that we could pile our three children into. When the sales associate recommended we take a look at the Bravada, I looked at my husband, but said nothing. Well, always keep an open mind-this is roomy, easy to drive-the perfect family vehicle, without the &quot;family car&quot; look. Now, admittedly, I know very little about the technical aspects, but my husband approved, and that's saying alot, as we didn't go in planning on spending as much as we did. So, although a novice, I look pretty smart in my new Bravada! My kids fit great in the back, and there's still room in the back for all the extra junk that goes with a family of five.<br><br>
