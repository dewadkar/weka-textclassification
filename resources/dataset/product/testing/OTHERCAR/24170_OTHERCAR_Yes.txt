                 Camaros are one of the few cars we can call a 'classic' For people who havn't owned one such as myself until 12 months ago, must wonder what all the fuss is about and why Cameros are still popular to this day.
     I own a 1996 RS and I am thrilled with it. Many prefer the Z28 model for the V8 power it has but I wanted a car that was 'kitted out.' The '96 RS comes with a ground effects package and fully loaded.
     Chevolets are known for going wrong  as they age which is why it is extremely important to take care of your camaro. Have regular oil changes and tune ups whenever necessary.
     Camaros are known for their power and looks. However they should also get credit for the way they drive. Their handling, smooth ride, and quick acceleration will impress the average Jones. However, camaros have a lot of potential for modifications also. 
     If you're budget is a large portion of your choice for cars, the camaro is definalty value for you money. A fully loaded camaro (power everything, automatic, truck release, keyless entry, alarm system, T-tops, Bose Delco cd player...) won't cost you nearly as much as competitors. People tell me I got my car for a steal.
     As we all know, camaros are not for everyone. The back seats are not recommended for the average size person and I would not recommend this car for families! However, they are great for couples, teenagers, and folks that don't have passengers all the time. I'm not going to brag about this car all day. Now the rest is up to you but remember... this car is a legend...doesn't that tell you something?
