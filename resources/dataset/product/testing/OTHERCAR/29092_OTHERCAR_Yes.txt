            In 1986 my father-in-law suggested (I only winced a bit when my arm went up between my shoulder blades) that I take a ride down to &quot;the shop&quot; with him the day before I was to sign the deal on the Ford F-150 4X4 I was intending to buy.  

To keep peace in the family (never do anything to insult, or even ignore, your father-in-law?) I agreed to &quot;just look&quot; at the new Toyotas.  Being the head mechanic, he had keys to get in on Sunday, so I looked around a bit.  After I conceded to come back the next morning to take a test drive, he pulled to the curb, unlocked the car door, and drove me back home.  

I showed up early the next morning, and after taking the Toyota 4X4 out for a short (10 mile) test drive, I felt confident enough to call the Ford dealer and tell him I would not be in after all.  This started my love afair with Toyota.  

I paid $13,900 for the 1986 Toyota 4X4, drove it 5 years/150,000 miles, spent less than $1200 in maintenence and repairs (including tires), and then traded it in in 1991 for a new Toyota 4X4 pick-up.  I received a trade-in of $3,900!  

My 1991 did not fare as well, I only got 3 years out of it, and 55,000 miles...  When I was driving up a local hill at 45 MPH and got slammed into by a resident who never thought it might be a bad idea to pass a dump truck on a curved hill at roughly 70 MPH!  To get to the point; as he (the other driver in the Chevy Caprice Classic) underwent 4 hours of emergency surgery, I rode to the hospital with my wife in her Toyota Corolla to have a couple of pieces of glass removed from my scalp over my left ear.  (By the way - Wear your SEATBELT!!!)

I replaced this unit with a new 1994 Toyota 4X4, I was a true believer in the safety of the product.   

Since then, I purchased a 1996 Toyota Tacoma, and recently upgraded to the 1999 model Toyota Tacoma.

All of my Toyota Pick-ups have been the 4X4 model and the X-tra Cab Deluxe model.  I have been impressed most by the reliability, and safety of these units.  The styling and comfort comes as a close second in importance, and Toyota has improved in these areas with each consecutive model.  

My business involves spending up to 14 hours a day out and about, it is my rolling office!  The 1999 has most of the creature comforts, power door locks/windows, the stereo (next time I'll add the CD), bucket seats, automatic (forgot to mention, they were ALL automatic), tilt wheel, and many other features.  

I have owned many different trucks over the years, and I am sold on Toyota! 

By the way - My wife has a 1998 Corolla, my younger daughter has a 1994 Corolla, and my older daughter has a 1999 Corolla.  My mother in law has a Tercel, her husband drives a RAV4, my sister in law has an All-Trak,
my nephew drives a 1985 4X4, and on and on and on...
