            My aim at writing this review was not to provide you with a technical specification summary, but to give potential buyers a good idea of what to expect if they finally purchase the Olympus Camedia 3030 Zoom _in Europe_.

Buying a high-quality digital camera for personal use is not an easy decision to make, especially considering the very good prices traditional film cameras are offered at these days. Anyway, being a computer enthusiast since I can remember myself, I decided to make the big (and expensive...) step and went digital, replacing my (defective) Canon SLR.

I got my Olympus 3030 Zoom, along with an extra 32 MB SmartMedia card and NiMH batteries/charger for around $900, in Thessaloniki, Greece (Europe). Big money for a camera...

First impression out of the box: small camera, very lightweight, with handy LCD monitor and fully automatic. But the first shock comes when you connect it to a computer and see the pictures on screen: wow! The detail and brightness of color is amazing, especially in pictures taken at well-lit environments. One of my first pictures was a face close-up at full automatic mode; you could see the skin's texture in impressive detail.

Second thing noted: the instruction manual is disappointing. Only a small booklet of around 30 pages (per language) is provided in paper - the more detailed reference guide exists only in electronic form! I mean, OK, give me a break! I put up with not having a charger or an AC adapter or not even a carrying case included, I put up with having a mere 16MB SmartMedia card in the package, I ignored the fact that Photoshop was nowhere to see in the box, but _at least_ give me a good manual! I paid $900 for this camera, remember? Anyway, I resorted to my printer to print out the 230-pages manual... The reference manual describes all camera functions in detail but cannot help you learn genuine photographic issues, such as the effect of aperture priority settings and other similar stuff. Anyway, I can't blame Olympus for that, they probably consider the 3030 will be used by people already knowing the basics of photography.

The camera itself is, in one word, great. Great pictures, vivid colors, and allowing full manual control over exposure parameters. The only flaws I have noted so far are : a) automatic settings are not always optimal for low-light conditions that require the use of flash, resulting in either too dark or too bright pictures (this, however, can be corrected by switching to manual mode), and b) the viewfinder is not very reliable since it misses out an important part of the final picture. The menu system is not very intuitive but is not as difficult to use as many have stated. However, I would prefer being able to control basic parameters without having to switch the LCD monitor on (which consumes an enormous amount of power). Also, the infamous loose lens cap is not loose at all on my 3030. If you pay a minimum of attention it is very unlikely that you manage to loose it.

Connection to the computer is piece of cake. I use the included serial cable (old computer...) for it and am very satisfied with its performance, especially since the camera supports speeds up to 240kps. The included software is rather basic but works OK, and gives you some filtering options. Nevertheless I resent Olympus' decision to make Photoshop disappear from the package...

Overall the 3030 is a _great_ piece of equipment. Absolutely amazing image quality in well-lit environments and with good manual control in situations automatic settings can't cope with. Despite it's high price and Olympus' "stinginess" as far as extras are concerned I fully recommend it to anyone looking for crystal clear, lively digital pictures. Combine it with a good color printer (my review of Epson Stylus Photo 790 coming up soon) and you can forget all about traditional film photography - for good.
