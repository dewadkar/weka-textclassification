            I purchased a 99 Cougar when they first came out onto the market.  Let's see if I can fit all my problems into this space.  I have, on numerous occasions, had my brakes fail for no apparent reason.  My car has been in the shop almost every month since October of 98.  The dealership (as well as Mercury's own engineers) have been unable to determine why this keeps happening.  Since I cannot get the problem to reproduce when the mechanic and/or engineer is in the car, they can't fix it.  The gas tank cover has been replaced about 5 times, the trunk handle has been replaced 3 times, the catalytic converter has a problem which I am awaiting a fix on.  My advise to you all..... DON'T BUY A FIRST YEAR CAR!  <br><br>
