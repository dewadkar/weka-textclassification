            The Chrysler Sebring convertible is a great car for those sporty people out there like me.  I have it in candy red with a black top and gray leather inside.  It has a very smooth ride and is quiet inside.  I have not had any problems with this car since I got it 2 years ago.  I bought it for $25,000 and it is great.  I can take the top down in less than 30 seconds.  This is a great car for anyone.  I have had no problems with this car and recommend it.  Take it from me, the Chrysler Sebring convertible is a great car and worth the price.  <br><br>
