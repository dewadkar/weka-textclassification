            The Sentra is a good dependable car.  I've owned about 7 different cars from Nissan over the past 28 years.  Always a dependable car, I've come to like and trust them.  The Sentra is my wife's car, it has done her good over the years.  There were a few problems in the beginning (covered by manufacturer's warranty), but the car has been good.

One minor complaint is that the fabric on the visors is starting to wear away.  

Otherwise, it is mechanically solid, we take it to the shop for recommended work.  That is one of the most important things to do with any car, MAINTAIN it, such as oil changes, transmission fluid, etc.  

It is peppy on the highway, great gas mileage, over 30 mph!  That is good with escalating prices at the pump.  

It is comfortable in the front, and really not that bad in the rear.  You're not going to get a living room set in any car so people should just deal with the fact that they are in a car and not a status symbol.  It is transportation that depreciates the minute you leave the showroom.  We've taken this car on trips for up to 3 hours and have been comfortable (like able to walk) upon exiting the car.  <br><br>
