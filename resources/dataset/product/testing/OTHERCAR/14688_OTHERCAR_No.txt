            When I first drove my mother's 1999 Subaru Forester, I enjoyed it.  It was roomy and comfortable for a car (although not really when compared to other mini-SUVs), and felt safe with the ABS and all-wheel drive.  I could see more of the road because the car has higher suspension, but it was not so high that it increased the risk of rollover.  It went around turns without pulling quite as much as some other SUVs, but the position of the steering wheel and pedals are just like a car.

It was not until driving the car for a while longer, having to sit in the back seat, and having to take the car grocery shopping that I began to notice some serious flaws in the design.  Strangely, the 1999 Forester lacks an inside lever to open the hatch.  This small detail which could be easily overlooked on a test drive can become a real pain when trying to get packages out of the car.  

Another detail that might not be apparent immediately is that the back seat is horribly uncomfortable.  This is fine for a single person or local driving, but isn't too much fun for a family or group of people on a long trip.  While there are no glaring problems with the Forester, I found that the small details and comforts could have used more thought.
 
I chose a Honda CR-V for myself because I am a bit taller than my mother, and liked the extra room up front, the way that the pedals and steering wheel were positioned more like a truck, and the higher front suspension, which made it easier to get under the car.  Over time, I have grown to appreciate the small details like the hatch release, locking fuel tank, door locks designed to prevent you from locking your keys in the car, and loud beep when the lights are left on.  Although these things may seem unnecessary, they can be priceless when you don't have to deal with locksmiths or a dead battery because you made one mistake.

I understand that many of these details are just a matter of preference.  It was not until I heard that the dealership wanted to charge my mother $400 for a 30,000 mile check that I really began to have problems with the Forester that would lead me to encourage others not to buy this vehicle.  "I'll do it for less than half of that!" I said, hating to see my mother get ripped off that badly (the parts themselves actually cost about $80).  All I asked was that she buy me a Chilton's manual, and this is where the trouble started.

I wrote to the publishers of Chilton's and Haynes (the two major car manuals available to the normal consumer), and neither of them had a manual.  I was fine with that - I am pretty good at figuring things out, so I wrote to Subaru of America to get the torque specifications for the brake, suspension and engine after I was unable to find this information online.  This is just a list of numbers that is about two pages long - not much to ask for with a $20,000 car, right.  Apparently, Subaru of America thinks it is.

After waiting several days and sending another e-mail at the request of the service assistance department giving greater detail about what I needed, I waited for the rest of the week before I was sent an e-mail saying that they are "not in a position to research and offer this type of specific technical information."  They recommended I "check with your local Subaru dealership," who, of course, told me to bring it in and pay $400 to do something that I could easily do in an afternoon.  The first dealership I spoke with refused to give any information and it was not until I called another dealership that, by chance, had a mechanic answer the line because it was late in the day that I got any questions answered at all.

I have never had this much trouble getting simple information on a car in my entire life, nor had such a bad experience with a company that tries to get people to purchase $20,000+ items.  And as if that frustration was not enough, when I decided to just use my CR-V book and do my best (with the advice of an independent mechanic), I soon found that everything in the Forester is difficult to access.  Even the air filter (usually one of the easiest things to do) was a huge pain because of the design of this vehicle, and the spark plugs are inaccessible unless several other parts are removed.

After really looking at this vehicle, I am much happier with my better designed, more comfortable CR-V along with the far more helpful staff of Honda.  I strongly urge that people looking at a Forester check out some of the other mini-SUV's - why pay more for frustration?
