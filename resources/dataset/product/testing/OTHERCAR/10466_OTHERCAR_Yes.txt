            My bro got me this for xmas, and it opened me to the world of digital photography.  I got myself a viking 128mb card (which I also recommend) and started going nuts.  That's what digital photography is all about; guilt free photo shooting.  No more procrastinating about whether a shot is 'worthy' of spending film on, plus the trip to the developer.  Now I shoot everything I find even remotely interesting on field trips to Colorado, Wyoming, California, etc.  And with the Powershot A200, it only took about 1 days worth of practice to get the hang of.  It helps to turn off the AiAF so you only have one 'box' to worry about instead of 3.  Point this box in the direction you wish to shoot and note in the LCD if it is brighter or darker than you would like.  If so, point the box towards another object (a darker object to lighten exposure, a lighter one to darken exposure) and when it looks good hold down the shutter button halfway.  This might take a little practice because you have to keep the pressure constant.  Now point back towards your intended object and press the shutter button the rest of the way.  Practice this a lot and you can all but eliminate under and over exposed photos.  Then you can try more advanced techniques like adjusting the ISO speed.  For example, you can freeze frame water droplets in waterfalls with an ISO setting of 400 or you can give them a silky hair-like look with an ISO of 50.  It's good to have a few manual settings like this to work with.  I recommend using the Cloudy white balance setting as a 'default' as it generally produces the best color replication, especially outdoors and yeah even on sunny cloudless days.  In general, making it look as good as possible in the LCD will also produce the best results when you upload them to your computer.  BTW, I recommend getting a cheap but useful CompactFlash-USB adaptor so you can plug your memory card into your computer without using your camera.  Although it is perfectly fine to connect your camera to the computer, it does eat up your batteries.  And speaking of batteries, do not use alkalines.  They just don't have enough juice.  Get yourself a set of at least 4 NiMH style batteries and a good charger - I'm very happy with my Powerex 1700 with MAHA charger.  Without flashes I get well over 100 shots.
Every camera has an achilles heal, and for the Powershot A200 it is that it does not have optical zoom.  Digital zoom stinks, do NOT use it on this camera unless you like squares instead of smooth edges.  Take ALL of your photos completely zoomed back and use Photoshop or another good editing program to crop the unwanted areas.
