            As in the title, this is my first experience with a digital camera.  I had known about the megapixels etc., but when it really came down to cameras, I did not go to the store and compare them, most of my comparing was done online, mostly by price.

After several weeks of actually searching for a picture printer, HP had a deal where you could buy this camera and the 7150 printer.  So I grabbed it.

One of the main reasons that we chose to switch to the digital camera is the price of photo studio pictures.  We have two small children and the price to get pictures for everyone in the family, every 6 months became a financial burden.  With two kids, everyone wanted one of each of the children by themselves and one together and of course all the prints needed to satisfy everyone.  After comparing the price of the camera, paper, and ink to the photo studio pictures, we were saving money.  With the right photo editing program you can do wonders.

I knew the camera had good megapixels but was not sure what to expect.  After playing with it, even at the lowest megapixel setting, my everyday pictures, snap shots of the kids, come out great.  The pictures are clear as if taken with a regular 35mm camera, if you're steady handed.  The middle setting (2 stars) are even better and the highest setting (3 stars)are fabulous.  The sharpness of the photos have amazed me.  And also the print quality at all the settings.

I love the zoom quality.  The only way to use the 12x zoom is through the LCD screen which allows great close ups.  The shutter can be switched to rapid shutter, which I have to use quit frequently with my 2 small children, if the rapid shutter is off, the camera will focus, flash once and then flash again to take the picture.  If you don't let people know that the camera flashes twice before actually taking the picture, they will move thinking the picture was taken after the first flash.  I don't think of that as a negative, just information that is good to know.

The only issue that I have with the camera, and this maybe with all digital cameras, is the battery life.  I was buying regular photo batteries about every 2-3 weeks, even with the camera off.  Lithium photo batteries run about 10.00 for pack of 4 and that was getting expensive. I finally had to breakdown and buy rechargeable batteries just to be able to use the camera when I wanted to.  I am not sure why the batteries are short lasting it could be keeping track of the date and time, etc.  I know that using the LCD screen to view your pictures takes up a lot of the battery, along with adding any audio to those pictures.  The manual recommends that you try not to use the screen to save the battery life.

Another one of the things that I like, in the money saving area, is that fact that if you take a picture where you have cut someone's head off, they turned away, or the camera took a picture of the ceiling, they can be deleted and you are not paying for the photo developing on useless things.

All the features on the camera I have not used as of yet, the video camera, the timer, etc.  I plan on using these things over the summer and see what happens.

I will keep you posted on the new features that I uncover.
