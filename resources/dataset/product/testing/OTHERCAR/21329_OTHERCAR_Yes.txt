            When i wanted to present my sister a new car for her marriage,i really was very confused. Given that there are 100's of choices for a married person , mid size sedans are the best choice.
Toyota camry, Honda accord are the two good choices in that class.
But ,Toyota camry is little cheaper than Honda accord.
Toyota camry has three models CE , LE , and XLE.
All the models are very good.
A V-6 engine is available on LE and XLE models. All Camry models feature several standard amenities such as a tilt steering wheel, front and rear dual cup holders, center console storage with cover and auto-off
headlamps. The LE and XLE models feature upgrades such as cruise control, air conditioning and the Power Package that includes power windows, door locks and mirrors.
Optional equipment includes side-impact airbags, mudguards, CD changer, front fog lights and traction control (V-6 models only).

The price and features grow from CE to LE and to XLE.
The major points that one should note about camry are :
1. RELIABILITY 
2. Most of the necessary Major Features for a comfort car are included
3. QUALITY 
4. SPACIOUS enough for a 4-5 member family.

I am currently a proud owner of 1999 camry XLE.
Try it and you will feel it for yourself!<br><br>
