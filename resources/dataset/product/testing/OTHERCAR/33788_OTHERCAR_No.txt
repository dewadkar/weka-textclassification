            Don't waste your money on a throw away car! In Feb. of 1996 my grandparents made me trade in my 1966 Mustang and (supposably) get a reliable car.  During the first week the Locktronics on it broke and I had to learn to hot wire my car because I was on spring break in Branson, MO.  Then the back seat broke where it wouldn't fold down anymore.  Then all of the doors broke.  Then they had a recall on the door mechanisms.  Then all the doors broke at different times.  Then the heater went out on my way to St. Louis in the middle of winter.  

Then, you are not going to believe this, the engine blew.  I would have had it put up on blocks on that one but I had a 100,000 mile warranty and after many painstaking days it was ruled as not my fault and let me tell you it saved my life.  But now the warranty is up and here are all the things that are broke on it right now:  the driver door will not unlock from the outside, the back seat is broke again, the sliding lever that controls where the air is blown is broke, the lighter hasn't worked in years, the back defroster button won't go down to activate it, the driver side window won't rool up right so it rains into the car on rainy days, the stereo won't play tapes, for some reason I have gone through three alternators and recently I tapped a guy from behind and it bent the frame.  I have never been in a wreck in my life and this one was just a tap and it BENT the frame! Can you believe that?  Now, it's going to cost an arm and a leg to get it fixed and I didn't even do any damage to the Lincoln Town Car I hit!  I don't even want to think what could have happened if I had been in a real wreck!  

There is only one good thing I can say about this car and it is:  It gets good gas mileage.  I'll now give you the details of the car: 4 door, blue, had 33,000 miles on it when I got it, 4 cylinder, automatic, no cruise control, no power locks, no power windows and it had Locktronics.<br><br>
