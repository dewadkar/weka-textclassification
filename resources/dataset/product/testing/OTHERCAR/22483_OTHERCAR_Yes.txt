            My first car was a little Suzuki Samurai.  It was loud, and slow, and noisy, but it got me around.  After a brief stint with a Trooper, I bought a Vitara. Initially, I had thought I would buy a RAV4, but sticker shock quickly put a damper on that idea.  I knew that Suzuki had come out with the Vitara line, and I decided to give it a go.  When I initially test drove the car, I was impressed with it's road handling, and it's ability to maneuver even in Washington DC beltway traffic.  The engine was dead silent, a far cry from my trooper's bellowing engine.  

One of the greatest things about the car has to be the price.  I bought a base-model 4-door JS for 14,500.  It is also extremely fuel-efficient, more so than what the sticker said.  I find I am getting over 30 miles to the gallon with a lot of highway driving.  The car is also a lot roomier than I thought it would be.  I finally sat in the back seat the other day, and even being 5'11&quot;, I still felt very comfy.  

The drive itself is smooth - I have found that the Vitara accelerates poorly at times, and I have noticed a slight hiss when going from 55 to 60, but it's very low and almost unnoticeable.  The controls are laid out well, with everything in a reasonable reach.  Shifting is easy, but sometimes a little jerky.

The only problems that I really have are the lack of Suzuki dealers in my area.  It was hard to comparison shop and get exactly what I wanted.  I also think it's a shame that the car isn't as marketed as well as it should be. My roommate bought a Ford Focus and I had to admit I was jealous of all the neat promotional stuff they sent him!

It's a great car for a college student or a young professional, like myself.  I would recommend one without reservation to any one of my friends.  In fact, my neighbor liked my Vitara so much that he bought one for himself!
