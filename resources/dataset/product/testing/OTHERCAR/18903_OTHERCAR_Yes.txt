            Last year, we purchased a 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee for our lake up in Minnesota. Let me tell you that it does everything that we need it to do and so much more. The leather seats are very comfortable and being able to purchase ours for $14,000, also very economic. You can also feel the power under the hood with its 6 cylinder, 4.0 liter, and 190 horsepower engine! With our Laredo, 4 door 4 wheel drive, Sport Utility version we get 16 miles to the gallon in the city and about 21 gallons to the mile on the freeway. This is not as bad as the huge SUVs (i.e. the Excursion or Suburban) but it�s also not as good as those SUV wanna bees. With the Jeep Grand Cherokee, you also get the room with over 176� in cabin room. You also have room for the kids with its five person seating capacity. I wasn�t able to find the towing capacity of this vehicle, but I can tell you that it can tow our huge Sea Ray (I�m not sure how much this weighs). My dad, who has business up in Minnesota, drives the Jeep Grand Cherokee through the snow up there and says that it is very reliable with it�s 4 wheel drive you will be able to get out of almost any snow bank. As you can probably see, the 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee is a very well rounded Sport Utility Vehicle.  <br><br>
