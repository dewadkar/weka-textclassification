            I got my digital camera a couple of years ago when I went overseas to teach. When I returned, it was to find my mother trying to decide if she wanted a digital camera of her own. I cheered and jeered and begged and pleaded for her to get one. Finally, she did. She bought an Olympus C-3030. 

Mom is not a professional photographer, but she does like to take a lot of pictures. Having a digital camera lets her take lots of pictures without ever feeling bad about wasting film. It also guarantees that she has a chance to get the picture she wants. No more taking a picture only to find out it didn't turn out. It has a wide LCD view screen (1.8"x1.8") which allows her to make sure she's got what she wants.

To mom's pleasure, but to the chagrin of her subjects, the camera has red-eye reduction. Thus, whenever we are photographed, we first get thoroughly blinded before the actual picture is taken. However, there is little or no red-eye in mom's photos.

The C-3030 has a sleek design. More square than a film camera, it is still comfortable to hold.  Clearly the designers were thinking about ergonomics when they put this one together. Ideal for a photographer like my mom; it has auto just about everything. It has a built-in flash. It combines an Olympus 3x optical lens with 2.5x digital zoom. It has autofocus which is a very handy thing for the not so proficient photographer. The spec sheet says that it is the 35mm Equivalent of 32-96 mm, has a focal length of 6.5 to 19.5 mm, a focus range of 8" to infinity, and a macro focus range of 8 to 30 inches. 
 
It provides a resolution of 3.34 million pixel CCD which makes for some incredibly clear pictures. This is way above what is necessary for sending pictures on line or putting them onto a web page. Mom, however, prints out everything. For her, the higher resolution is very important. 

Although mom will never use any additional lenses, the C-3030 is set up to accomodate an external flash TTL sync connection and adapters for optional lenses and filters. For someone who enjoys photography and all the toys that go with it, this camera offers a chance for more creativity.

The C-3030 has USB, QuickTime movie recording mode with sound, and long-life batteries. It uses a Smart Media Card for storage. It came with a 16 MB Smart Media Card though mom quickly chose to upgrade to a 64. For the 16 MB card, it is possible to store 6 images in Fine Mode, or 31 in standard mode. With her 64MB card, she can take 6 in superfine mode, 27 in Fine mode and 199 in normal. You can store a whopping 1 picture in superfine mode. The compression types include JPEG, Raw Image and TIFF. Compression Modes are 1:4, 1:9, 1:11, 1:12. The 16 MB card can also take 1 second of movie. A microphone is required for sound recording.

Mom really likes the camera. She works at a center for active seniors and is constantly clicking away. She recently came back from a week's cruise, and had nearly 100 pictures on her 64 MB card. 

With a USB download, the pictures transfer pretty quickly. Mom uses a Lexmark Z22 printer with photographic paper to print out pictures. She gets a lot of compliments on them. 

The camera comes with a readable users' guide, a camera strap and with CAM Media software. This is a great camera for the average consumer. It is more than most of us will ever need. Most importantly, it's easy to use so it gets used. Mom has been taking more pictures this year than ever before, and loving it. That's the best recommendation I can give.
