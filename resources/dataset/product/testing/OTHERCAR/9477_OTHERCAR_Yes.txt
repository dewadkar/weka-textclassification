            Hi!I'm the mother of a 2 year old son and a wife to a truck fan.We shopped around for a so-called family truck for about 2 months and decided we would get my husbands choice:2000 Dodge Ram 1500 series off road, 4x4.  We have never made a better choice with vehicles.  This truck is a miracle.We have had it only 4 months,but has had no problems with it at all.  We have taken this truck all over,from in the woods to taking it on a trip to Maryland(we live in Florida.)  It's roomy,comfortable,big,pretty,KIDS LOVE THIS BIG MACHINE!!  My son has gotten to where he will ride no where else but in the burgandy Dodge.    It's a good truck for hauling and pulling and has good traction.  I've had other trucks and cars,but this one will always be my number one choice now.  If you are looking for a truck that has power,ability to withstand the worst situations,a truck your kids will love to ride in,a truck for playing and taking on trips,then you have found your truck.  The only sacrifice is you have to be willing to pay a little bit of money but you get a whole lot out of it,and you have to be willing to love your truck.I have no complaints at all with this truck.   Your only regret will be that you didn't buy this truck sooner.  Thank you for reading my article,I hope it has helped you in your decisions.  <br><br>
