            Well, I purchased at 1996 Chevy Corsica on April 9, 1997.  That's my my son's birthday and I knew she was going to be a winner (so now we celebrate for two reasons).

Mine was purchased from a Chevy dealer, used, rental vehicle with 22,000 miles on it.  I was a little leary about another used vehicle, but did it anyway, after test driving this car.

I purchased this vehicle after a little research:  1)  It's a popular fleet or rental vehicle so I found that it maintained well on the road with minimal maintenance and upkeep (I was right, for once).  2)  It's pretty (important to me, also).  3) More than that, the ride is smooth and very comfortable.  4) The price is right (no, I'm not Bob Barker).  5) I like 6 cylinder engines.

I've not had to do a great deal for my &quot;carbaby&quot;.  Oil changes, I hear from mechanics, are the only thing this baby needs to keep-a-runnin'.

I've replaced an alternator, true enough, but that could've been worse.  I've driven over 60,000 miles in this car since 4/97 and it's holding up well.  Not to mention my lead foot.  Driving this car at above-average speeds (not that I recommend speeding) for many miles, driving every day (we usually put about 100 miles on a day - for the last year).  

It's just a beauty.  I love my Corsica.  <br><br>
