            Ever since I bought my 750iL I have been in heaven when driving locally and on the open road.  This 12 cylinder, 7 series BMW gives added acceleration and a true sports car feel that you just can't find in other large luxury cars.

At first, I was considering the 740iL but was quickly sold on the larger engine alternative when driving one out of the dealership and onto the open road.  It's powerful acceleration and tight handling were incredible!

I'm very tall, so small sports cars are not an option for me.  My 750 provides the room and comfort of a "large boat" American car with a sports car like performance and handling.

When driving at night, I often find some 19 year old in his 4 cylinder, late model compact, wants to race me to the next stoplight.  It's satisfying to know that if I wanted to, I could leave him in the dust.  But why bother, since his overactive testosterone is no match for the legendary BMW 12 cylinder engine.

If you mostly drive alone, then the 740i might be a less expensive alternative worth considering.  Drivers with frequent back seat guests, should consider the extra legroom in the long wheel base model.  It provides the roominess back seat passengers really want in a premium luxury car.

The only bad things I can say about this car is how often it keeps me going back to the gas station for fill-ups.  I sometimes feel that if I looked long enough, I could actually watch the gas gauge move.  And if you leave the car idling to warm the seats on a cold day, then watch out for those noxious exhaust fumes when you return, they can leave you gaging for fresh air -- the powerful 12 cylinder engine doesn't come without some drawbacks.

Maneuvering into tight spaces can be a problem, but that's when park distance control is most useful.  Although somewhat annoying to hear when you don't need it, it's a must have for tight garage parking.

Now that BMW has it's new 745iL model, with an automatic 6-speed and 325 HP packed into an 8 cylinder engine, I think the performance gains in the 750iL is no longer as important a consideration.  When I'm finally done enjoying my 750 I've already decided the 745iL will be my next car!
