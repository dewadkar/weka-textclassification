            I am a first time driver, and my testosterone got the better of me when I saw an ad for a 1991 MR2. I purchased the car for $5,000, which is low for this car. It obviously needed a little work but not much. It drives like a dream, and the bucket seats give it that true sports car feel. The 4-cylinder engine pumps out 132 hp., and man does it sound great. Though it is only a two seater there are many places in the interior to store a purse or a small bag of groceries. The car handles beautifully. And stops on a dime. Needless to say I am excited to have such a nice first car. Some of the only drawback are the lack of space in the interior, and minimal trunk space. It was a wonderful buy and I encourage buyers to consider this vehicle.<br><br>
