            I saw this camera on sale at Office Depot.  Normally it was $75, but there was an instant rebate and I got it for $40.

This camera comes with two cables - one for a USB connection and the other is for a 9-pin serial connection (for those of us who do not have a USB port on the computers).

There are four pieces of software that come with it:  Photo Fantasy, Photo Printer, Photo Studio, and AVI Creator.  Installation of the software was easy, as was the drivers.  Installing all four programs requires a hefty chunk of hard drive space - almost 100 MB - for some pretty basic programs.

The last thing to do to get ready to take pictures is put 3 AAA batteries in the camera.

I tried taking pictures outside first.  It was 2:00 in the afternoon in Wisconsin.  We had just gotten some snow and it was pretty bright out.  The camera would make the low tone beep indicating there was not enough light.  

I took it inside.  Tried to take a picture of our Christmas tree all lit up with the living room lights lit and two picture windows behind it.  There was more than enough light, and the camera made the high tone beep indicating the picture had been taken.  

Time to download the pictures.

These pictures were the worst quality pictures I have seen in digital cameras.  I used the photo editing software to try to make the picture quality a little better, but nothing worked.  If there was a person in the picture, you could not identify their facial features (like their eyes, or nose, or even their mouth).  They were just heads on bodies.

This is an <b>awful</b> camera.  Do not waste your money.
