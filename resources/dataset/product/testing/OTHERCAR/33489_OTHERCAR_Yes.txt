            This review is on a 1999 Subaru Impreza Outback Sport, auto transmission, which I purchased new.  It currently as about 85,000 miles on it.  If you ever come up to Vermont, you will notice many many Subarus on the road, including this particular model.  I think the reason is because these are relatively affordable cars that have standard AWD, which is a big plus here in Vermont.  You also see many older Subarus up here that are still on the road, which I think is a testament to the longevity.

Ok, to start, this car has a 2.2 liter 4 cylinder boxer engine which puts out about 140 hp or so.  Since it's a fairly small vehicle, that is plenty of power.  I get on the average between 22-25 mpg.  There is an Impreza L model which has only a few differences, most of which are cosmetic, but most significantly, the OBS has ABS.  That was a big factor in us going with the OBS instead of the L.

Standard features are fairly generous for cars of that time period.  You get power windows, power locks, am/fm stereo cassette with 4 speakers, AC, but no cruise control, or CD player.  The only option that we added was keyless entry/alarm.  The interior is only ok.  There's a good amount of plastic and the pattern on the cloth seats is a bit on the ugly side (grey with purple???).  However, the front seats are comfortable and supportive even on extended 6+ hour road trips.  BTW, the location of the front cupholders are awful.  One of them is in the dash, just above the climate control, so when it is deployed, you have a difficult time changing the HVAC settings.  The other front cupholder is in the console between the driver and passenger seats.  There are no rear cupholders.

This car handles very well in the snow, especially if equipped with winter tires.  The AWD also helps with the handling even in dry conditions.  We live on a dirt road and even if the ground is not wet, you can lose traction at times.  The Subaru has not let us down yet.  The car is fairly quiet on the highway.

In terms of reliability, we have put quite a lot of miles on our OBS over the past 3 years, so obviously, we have had to do things such as brakework and replaced the OEM tires.  I have had to replace both the front and rear struts as well as one of the rear wheel bearings.  I have also noticed as of late that I have a slow leak in my water pump, which I will need to address soon.  However, other than a couple of flat tires, we have never had to call for a tow.

One thing about this car is that it has very inadequate rear seat room.  When my daughter was an infant, and in the rear-facing car seat, we had to place her seat behind the passenger seat and push that all the way up to the point where no one could really sit comfortably up there.  Even now that she is foward-facing, there is not too much leg room in the rear seat.  Also, the rear seat folds to make a pretty cavernous cargo area, but only the seatbacks are split.  Since we have the baby seat back there now, all we can do is fold down the seat back next to her, which does not go flat by any means.  Also, the rear anchor for the car seat is at the far end of the cargo area (right by the tailights), so we have this canvas strap stretching across the cargo hold.

This car seems to fit in an interesting niche, as on the one hand it is comparable to cars like the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, etc., but on the other, its standard AWD might draw comparisions with much more expensive cars like the Audi A4.  If you don't care about driving an Audi, but you need the AWD, then the Subaru is worth a look as a no-frills option.  Compared to cars like the A4, the Subaru is definitely as step down in terms of refinement, but you'll save a bundle of $.
