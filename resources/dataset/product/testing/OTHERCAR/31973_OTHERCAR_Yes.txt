            I bought this vehicle when it first came out in 1994.  Since then we have purchased a second 1999 version, but still have the 1994.  I love all the features both vehicles have and the price.  The Passports are smooth vehicles that can get you into trouble(off road) and out of trouble (out of ditches) in an instance.  I think all types of people should buy or at least try this vehicle.  The price is right and it is a safe vehicle for all family members.  I have had little problems with the 1994 version, none that could not be fixed immediately, and no problems with the 1999 version.  We, a family of 5, have taken several trips and have had no problems and all the comfort.  The Passport is roomy and comfortable.  We bought our Honda Passport fully loaded power everything and 4 wheel drive on the floor.  The 4 wheel drive is easy to get in and out of without having to get out of the vehicle.  Just a little rolling forward and back and you are in 4 wheel drive.  I recommend this vehicle the price is right.<br><br>
