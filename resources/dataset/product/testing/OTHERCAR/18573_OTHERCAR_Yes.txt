            I have owned my QV-8000SX for over a year now, I see the price has dropped from $500 to about $200 or less. At the time I was looking for a camera that took better pictures than my starter Vivitar digicam, and this one takes great pictures. I have taken more pictures in a year with my digicams than I have the rest of my life (I'm 45) with film cameras. I take it every where and shoot pictures all the time. I put them on my web site for all family and friends to see. This camera had the best features for the price at the time I bought it. I also wanted the 8X optical zoom which was the highest on the market at the time. I have taken pictures at the highest quality (1.3 MP) and have printed them on my printer up to 8X10 with excellent results. I just wish it had a view finder. In sun you can not see the LCD screen. Even if you shade it it is really hard to see. I have found using rechargable batteries is the way to go, so batteries are not a problem. It takes standard CF cards, which are getting cheap, and has a USB connection (much improvement over serial). As an amateur I am not wanting (except for a view finder) with this camera. I think for other than bright sun shots, it is just the ticket for someone getting started in digital cameras.
