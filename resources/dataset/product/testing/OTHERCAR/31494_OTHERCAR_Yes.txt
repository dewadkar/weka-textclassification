            Last week, I was sad when our 17 year old Mazda RX-7 failed emissions because it needed a rebuilt carburetor.  We decided that it was time to get a new car.  

I did a lot of research before deciding to buy a new car.  I looked at most foreign cars priced between $10,000 - $15,000.  Specifically I looked at the Toyota Echo, Mazda Protege, Honda Civic, and the Nissan Sentra.  The cheapest was the Toyota Echo, which in my mind, isn't the most eye pleasing and doesn't offer power windows.  But the next cheapest, to my amazement, was the nice looking Nissan Sentra.  With the mid level model, you get a ton of accessories, all, when priced with the dealer invoice, is less than $13,000 for a manual shift.  The accessories include power locks, power windows, cruise control, A/C, CD player, Tachometer, and more.

So I went to the dealership to try it our.  When I first sat down, I felt like everything was in my reach, and everything was low enough to give me a good view of the road.  I also noticed that I had plenty of head room.  Me being 6'0&quot;, that is important.  I had an extra three or four inches above my head.

The drive was comfortable, it felt firm like most foreign cars of it's class.  The A/C was frigid which is good in Tucson, Arizona.

There is plenty of room in front, especially if you move the front seat back all the ways.  But, like other cars in it's class, the back is tight, although livable.

One thing I didn't like is the gear ratio on the stick shift.  I was used to a sporty Mazda RX-7 so I am willing to accept the ratios that it has to offer.  My only other complaint is that the engine does get a little noisy on the freeway.

Other than that, I love the car, I think more so than our Toyota Corolla that cost us about 5,000 more (the Toyota was a top of the line and an automatic, but that doesn't make up for the 5 grand difference.)  I enjoy driving it to work and errands because it feels so solid.

If you are searching for a car that offers a ton of extras for a good price, this is the car.  I would expect to a pay a few more grand for what I got, and that is what you pay if you go for a Toyota or Honda.  Nissans have also been proven to be reliable.  So, if you get this car, enjoy the extra's and the drive, even though your mechanic might miss you!<br><br>
