            I have the good fortune to play with a lot of cameras as part of my job.  I have the 2300Z and also the (more expensive) Nikon CoolPix 800.  But I keep using the 2300Z because I like the way it renders colors and the excellent macro shots.

The camera is a bit bulky and almost retro looking, as if it was inspired by an old Flash Gordon movie. Once you have the knack of half-pressing the shutter to lock in the focus and exposure, it is possible to get some fairly well-time shots.

The camera uses a CompactFlash card and I suggest using a card reader. You can use the camera with a USB connection, but you will need to plug in the (included) AC adapter.

The 8-18mm zoom is fairly sharp and works well in low light. Naturally in brighter light the lens stops down for a sharper image.  Flash coverage is good, the menu system average and the controls are well placed.

The included software will be good for most projects, but is certainly not PhotoShop!

I'd suggest this camera over a better known brand name with a lower resolution.  go for the pixel count!
