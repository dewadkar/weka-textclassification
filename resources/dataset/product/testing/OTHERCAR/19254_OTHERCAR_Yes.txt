            UPDATE JAN, 2004:

We just returned several days ago from a 5000 Kilometer (3000'ish mile) road trip in the Montana, this being our longest trip to date in this van.  

Our feelings afterwards?

-Everything performed well.  The van was smooth, and fuel milage on the way down was in the 22 MPG range - slighly less then expected, but the van was heavilly loaded with 6 passengers, and all the luggage that goes along with such.  Additionally, for the first half of the trip south, we were bucking heavy winds.  This obviously didn't help, as the onboard fuel computer clearly showed.

- The return trip averaged better milage, in the 25 MPG range.   The wind was much more friendly.   Our experience with this van, when lightly loaded on the highway, and driven gently, is that 30+ MPG is achievable.

Engine power is notably lacking at freeway speeds, as our original review (below) touches on.   Acceleration from a standstill is impressive, even when heavilly loaded with people and luggage, but passing once up to cruising speed requires a hefty push on the accelerator, a downshift, or sometimes (Ack!) two, and some patience while the engine builds up a head of steam.   More HP would have been nice, but the fuel milage penanty that would have to be paid in order to accomplish this would probably not be worth it - I can deal with a sluggish pass under exceptionally heavy loaded circumstances in exchange for A+ MPG.  :-)

As our original review (below) mentions, the fuel computer remained completely out of whack for the entire trip when it came to "Milage remaining" calculations.  Even after such a long trip (Which should have gave it an opportunity to reset...?) it still blatantly overestimates how far the van is supposed to be able to travel on the remaining fuel.   We give up.  :-)

Overall, the roadtrip went well.   The only major gripes would have to be the seats - after 3-4 hours of driving without a stop, the seating did tend to get irritating.   Pontiac could have done a better job with the seats, as I've owned other vehicles in which a 3 hour stint at the wheel resulted in your rear-end remaining comfy.  Not an issue for around town driving, or short highway stings, but on a long road trip like this, it could be an issue if road trips are routine.

Otherwise, we were happy!   No mechanical issues whatsoever, and no surprises...except a dead battery, which was our own fault to begin with - we left our 12 Volt travel cooler plugged in during a night in a hotel.  Our bad.  :-)

And now, withour further disruption, please enjoy our original review, below!

---END UPDATE.

Our older 1990 Chevy Astro recently failed emissions, so it became time for an upgrade.   The Montana had been at the top of our "Shopping List" for some time.

So, the hunt began for the best deal.  :-)

Although I will have to admit that I am biased towards General Motors products, we did give the competition a fair chance.

It quickly became obvious however that there was no comparison between the Montana/Venture lineup, and the competitions offerings.   Reliability, price, available options, and fuel economy seemed superior on the Montana when compared to all other models, and the van simply looked better..inside, and out!

So, off to the dealships we went, looking for the "perfect" van, based on what we had in mind for options, and colours.

It didn't take long, and we found ourselves signing the paperwork for a new Montana.   And the adventure began. :-)

First Impressions:

There was no mistaking that this was a new generation van.  Having come from driving a 12  year old Chevy Astro, the Montana seemed astonishingly different.   There's no sqeaks, rattles, groans, and all of the other quirks that we had gotten used to with our old van.   The new car smell was also a nice bonus, regardless of the fact that the chemicals that compose this smell are apparently bad for ones self.

Regardless, we immediately fell in love with the Montana.  The interior, when compared to the competition, simply appears more refined, less "Plasticky", and laid out better then the competition we had looked at.

Controls, for the most part, are well laid out, and are easilly actuated even with gloves on, which during the winter months in Canada, is very handy.

All of the seats are comfortable, well supporting, and all of the rear buckets fold down to reveal cup holders molded into their backs.  Little things go a long way..

The power sliding side door was also a "Must have" option for us, making getting the kids in and out much easier then ever before.   Oh, the kids think it's cool, too.. More on this later in the review.  

Storage pockets, buckets, and hiding spots are fairly plentifull, which is handy for kids stuff.

With the extended wheelbase model, luggage space is more then sufficient behind the two rearmost seats, with plenty of space for numerous large suitcases.   There are also lots of clothes hooks at various locations in the celing conners.

Driving:

As mentioned, this van feels refined.  The ride is smooth, handling is excellent (For a minivan), and the sound level is acceptable.   Again, comparing to our old Astro, it's strikingly quiet in the interior, but after having owned the van for a period of time now, it's apparent that it could be a little quieter..but generally, it's more then acceptable.

Power, although sufficient, is far from overwhelming.  I found the old 4.3L engine in the Astrovan was much "beefier" feeling then the 3.4L engine in the new Montana.  This shouldn't be surprising, but it did take some getting used to - the Astro just "feels" more powerfull, regardless of the fact that it weighs considerably more then the new Montana.

Regardless, power is more then sufficient for highway merging, passing, and hill climbing.  It certainly doesn't feel overly gutsy, however, sometimes almost languisihng a little untill the transmission downshifts, and the revs pickup, translating to more horsepower.

My biggest complaint, driveline wise, would be that the engine does seek out fairly high RPM's when power is demanded, and the slight underpowered feeling is very noticable.

IMHO, GM did itself a disservice when they switched from the old 3.8L engines that were used in the Montana's predecesor (The Transport), as the 3.8's were much more gutsy engines, with a virtually bulletproof reputation.  The newer 3.4 engine doesn't share any of these attributes.

What the 3.4L *does* have going for it, however, is fuel milage.  For such a large extended wheelbase van, both city milage, and highway milage are surprising.   With gentle driving, highway milage is nothing short of stellar, above the 30 MPG range.

The transmission is smooth, adapting to gentle city driving, as well as brisk driving nicely.  The software controlling the transmission does a fine job of minimizing shift "Hunt" in city driving, matching road speed to tranny gear nicely.

Performance:

As mentioned above, the engine is sufficient, yet not sportscar like in any fashion.

Towing capacity is listed in the 3000Lb range, which I find very high, but not unreasonable.   Even with 5 people in the van (3 being kids) the engine often revs-out fairly signifigantly when any sort of rapid acceleration is called on, making me guess that during trailer towing, revs would be consistently high.   This of course, means more heat, and more wear and tear.

I've not yet towed anything signifigant (Travel trailer, wise) with our Montana, but will eventually do so I'm sure.  I will update this review at that time to report the results of the experience.

Otherwise, the van provides a pleasant, mildly spirited ride, but be ready to live with some engine and exhaust whine when you really push the limits of it's power.

It *is* a minivan, however, so performance oriented driving isn't an everyday thing.  Your milage may vary.  :)

Features:

Our van is loaded, with the exception of a few options.   We didn't want leater (Too much maintenance), didn't need heated seats (Bah..just something else to go wrong), and we also didn't bother with OnStar.

We also didn't get the Montanavision package, opting to go with an aftermarket DVD entertainment system that was more to our liking.

Otherwise, we've got every option available..  Here's a few points on the more obvious ones:

Traction Control:  An interesting feature that my wife will appreciate this winter.   From my tiny bit of experience with it so far this winter (First snowfall), it seems to work good.  The system initially applies the brakes at the opposite wheel as is spinning, shifting traction to the (hopefully) non spinning wheel.   If both wheels are spinning, the system cuts the engine power untill traction is regained.   All this happens automatically, in very rapid succession, and the effect is decent.  If one insists on mashing the gas pedal when the Traction Control is active, it can lead for a slightly jerky ride as the system cyclically alternates from no engine power, to high engine power, and back and forth.  The best bet is to simply back off on the engine power yourself, and then let the system do the rest, rather then expecting it to do it all.

Rear Radio / CD Controls / Heater Controls:  This is a great feature we have grown to love already - the kids in the back can listen to their own choice of radio of CD/Tapes..  Basically, whatever feature is not being used on the main speakers, can be used (via headphone) in the rear.   My wife and I generally listen to the radio, so this leaves the CD Player accessable for the kids to listen to their choice of music.   Sweet relief.. :-)

Also, having control of their own temperature and rear-fan settings makes things easier as well.. No more "It's too hot/Cold!" complaints.   If things do get out of control, however, the rear controls can be overriden by switch at the front console.

ABS:  Ok, everyone knows how it works..  The Montana's works nicely.  End of story.  :)

Fog lights:  An option, usually bought only for looks..but to my surprise, they actually *WORK* on the Montana!  I was very surprised to flip them on for the first time, and find that they offered signifigant extra road illumination.  Impressive!   They are controllable seperately via a switch near the drivers seat.

Power Seats:  Again, self explanatory..but nice, especially having it on both front seats.

Cruise Control:  Standard GM cruise control, still with all of the controls clumsilly smashed all onto the signal stalk, as is common with most GM vehicles.    Functional, necessary for long trips..and one of the first things to break recently..requiring a trip to the dealer for a new Cruise Control module...at no cost under warranty. :)

Power Side Door:  Wow, a "Soccer Mom" feature (0r so I've been razzed about it by my co-workers..heh), but a wonderfull feature.   No longer do I have to help my 3 or 6 year old kids haul open the side door, as was the routine with the old Astro..  Now, with the push of one of three buttons (Keyring wireless remote button, one in the overhead console between the two front seats, and another on the pillar in front of the door itself), and the side door magically slides open and closed by itself.  My kids love it, I love it, and all is good in the world.

It's also great when one is coming out of the grocery store with full arms - simply hit the button on the remote entry keyfob, and the door slides open.  Sure beats fumbling for keys, and then hauling the door open manually.

Reliability was a concern, but the Montana is a few years old now, and it hasn't been a big concern on past models, so I gather it's not an issue.

There are safety checks built in to the door, as well.   If the van is put into gear with the door open, there is a buzzer that sounds to remind you of such.   Additionally, if something blocks the door during the close cycle, it will reverse and open again.  I was a little concerned about the force required to activate this feature, however, the first time I checked it out.   If a child were to get stuck, the force required to reverse the door may result in injury.  Use caution!

Overhead trip computer/compas:  Again, pretty standard fare - fuel computer, trip computer, compas, and temperature, all rolled into a display on the overhead console between the two front seats.   Works well, but ours seems to gloriously overestimate our "remaining Kilometers", still estimating we could drive 200K (120 miles), when in reality the fuel guage is sitting in the yellow.   There doesn't seem to be any way to reset this, or calibrate it.

The rest of the overhead console consists of reading lights, a sunglasses caddy, and a place to hide the garage door opener.   The optional OnStar system (Which we don't have) would also be located in this console.

Radio:  GM's radios have came a long way!   We've got the upgraded Monsoon system with both CD, and Tape Deck (Why?), and sound is stellar for a factory system.   The Radio Data system is nice, providing basic information on both the actual radio stations, and occasionally the tracks playing.  Buttons and dials are pretty straightforward, and the radio is easy to learn to operate.

Steering Wheel Radio Controls:   Wow, a nice feature that is every so handy..  Most basic radio / CD controls are covered  on the steering wheel buttons, which not only makes driving safer, but means that you rarely need to ever actually touch the radio itself.   Great!

Lighting:  Interior lighting is great, with enough lights to brightly light the interior of the van.  The lights come on automatically when the doors are unlocked (at loading), and as well when the engine is shut off, untill everyone has departed the van, and the doors locked.   Nice feature!

There are reading lights that basically cover each and every seat the van to varying degrees, even the rearmost seats.  For long trips, this is handy, releiving the need for the driver to lightup the entire van for only one passenger to search for something, or to..umm...read.  :-)

Rear Heat / AC:  On an extended van, this is a necessity to ensure the rear passengers stay comfortable.   Again, it works well, following the lead of the front HVAC controls set by the driver/front passenger.   There are many overhead vents that distribute cold/hot air, as well as a large floor vent that blows when the front floor heat is on.

The system works well, keeping the passengers happy, and it's controllable both by the driver / front passenger, but also by the rear-compartment passengers themselves.  (More on this later in the review).

Security:  Our Montana came with the factory installed security system, which is certianly nothing extroardinary - the standard fare of door/shock sensors, and the embarassingly inadequate "Honking Horn / Flashing Lights" method of going off.   May scare away the tamest of thieves in a public area, but hardly effective anymore otherwise.  Does anyone even listen to car alarms anymore?

Regardless, the little red flashing LED on the dash-top that indicates the system is armed may be the best part of the whole system, leading to the initial deterrent of break-in to begin with.

Yadda, Yadda, Yadda:  Of course, we also have the full complement of additionaly power features - locks, windows, mirrors, etc.  All work well, and are easy to utilize.   The power window controls do still seem "Backwards", however, compared to alot of the older-fare GM models we are used to.   This will take some getting used to.   Otherwise, everything is very straightforward and easilly operated.

Summary:

Well, we love it...  Since having bought ours, at least one of our friends was so impressed that he went out and bought a Venture (The Montana's Chevrolet cousin) himself.

We are concerned somewhat about reliability on some of the high-tech gadgets (Traction Control, power door, etc), but the warranty shoudld cover any unforseen issues, should they arise.

Thanks for reading my review - I hope it's helped make your buying decision easier.

I would greatly appreciate it if you would rate my review, and give me feedback on what you liked/disliked about it.

Thanks!
