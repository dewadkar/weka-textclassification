            Well my dad had decided to buy me a car for under 18,000 dollars for christmas, and it had to be a sedan, so I immiediatly looked at the luxury cars..and eventually found my 95 ES300. It's definately the best car I have ever driven in, talk about luxury! Speed too, this car roars with its 188 hp engine, yet its still so quiet. It also has a great sound system..but unfortunatly it didn't come with a cd player. Whoever can afford a Lexus should definately buy one..they are one of the best cars around! This car will definately last for awhile, because they are made with such high quality and have the best customer service, if I ever buy a new car after this one it will absolutely be a Lexus!!<br><br>
