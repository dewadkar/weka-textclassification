            I bought my 1995 Tracer brand new off the lot back at the close of 1995. It was priced cheap, under $12,000, but the dealer tacked on some add ons, like security. Total payment ended up around $1600.

At first I was not too impressed with this car, it was a change from the Nissan Sentra I had had before. There is an overdrive on the automatic transmission, which you use for non stop fast freeway driving, and speeds over 45. The problem was getting the car to go up to 60 or 65 on the freeway. It has to work up to that, and living in Southern California, you could easily get mowed trying to get on or off a freeway in this car. If you need to slow down for any reason, then you must build up your speed all over again. Thank God I do not live in or near L.A. or I would have been history ages ago. The car just can not handle constant freeway speeds or pressure.

However, living out here in the desert, unless I choose to, I do not have to get on the freeway all that often, and my little Tracer works just fine on surface streets. Since it has little pick-up on speed, it is a great little car for city driving. Because it is front wheel drive, I do have to buy front tires more often, and check them frequently for wear and tear. The main expenses have been tires and lube oil &amp; filter changes every three months. I have replaced the battery twice, and just this year, had the first smog test, which it passed, and had the transmission adjusted and cleaned. I have about 52,000 miles on the car.

Ford wrote us in 1999, and stated that they would no longer be manufacturing the Tracer after the 1999 models. I'm not sure if this is good or bad, but I know that I have not had to replace any major parts yet, except for a new timing belt this past week. They should be looked at every 50,00 miles, and mine was starting to wear. Now that the darn car is paid for I do not want to think of car payments for awhile, and hope to keep this car for a few more years.

I recommend this car for a family or just for a fun little car to tootle around in. If you have the need for speed or are a commuter on the freeway, look into a Nissan or other Japanese car, they seem to know how to handle our hazardous freeway systems out here.<br><br>
