            I can't tell you what drove me to purchase this car.  Maybe it was the down to earth and subdued opulence of the stitched velour seats.  It sat unassuming on the used car lot, but I could see the potential.

I autocrossed the car, and got a few laughs when I pulled to the line in a four door car with wire wheel hubcaps.  But when it launched, look out.  The simple looking car could burn rubber like no tomorrow.  It sounded like a dragon when floored!

I set several club records flying through the cones while listening to the extremely loud stereo.  I once lost control and hit a concrete light standard with the car causing it to go airborne.  It landed wheels down and floored.  Aside from being docked for missing several cones, the car was undisturbed.  That bounce freed a sticking door handle too!  How's that for quality.

While racing was fun, I spent most of the time hauling my sister's basketball team to practices and games.  We traveled all over the country, just the ten of us.

The car ran beautifully for the 270,000 miles I put on it.  I sold it at 463,000 miles, and it was still purring!  I saw it on the ferry a few years ago and learned that it became a rental car after I sold it.

I loved that car and the memories that we created together.
