            I bought an '01 Civic almost because i needed a car with very high MPG. at the time, this was pretty much the only vehicle that can acheive almost 40mpg highway. At first sight, this seemed like the perfect car; excellent fuel economy, flawless reliablilty and attractive exterior styling. Though i soon i discovered that there really wasn't too much to excite me about driving this car. I purchased the EX version with ABS and sideairbags. with the stronger 4- and the extra goodies, it wasn't long that i started yawning driving. perhaps it's the dull interior styling, or the terribly cheap stereo system. the speakers sound so awful and tinny, they seem to forget to upgrade the stereo also. The dash is pretty typical of Honda, and slightly boring. powertrain is okay, but would like to see more pep with the automatic, perhaps a stick-matic? One other thing is the fact there are hubcaps on the car. this car cost near 20K, and it has hubcaps??? interior is roomy, and i like the flat floor in the rear seat. seats are firm and supportive and headroom is good. Overall, i have enjoyed my Civic, but have a few suggestions of how it can be improved. i would consider another civic, after a new redesign, of course.
