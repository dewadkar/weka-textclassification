            I bought this abomination off of an auction site as most found themselves doing.  I bought it knowing full well the pictures would not be of any great quality.  The intent was to obtain a camera so I could take pictures of things I would auctioning off myself.

After about 50 shots I came to the conclusion that the camera was either defective, or a poor substitute for a crayons and a piece of paper.  Lord only knows that I spent more time photographing than it would have taken to draw a better image.

The picture was of a low resolution, which made for an appearance that one might see if their glasses were removed.  The image was able to be made out if you knew what you were looking for, but only under a thick blurry haze.  The color I must admit kept in tact.

I went to the manufacturer http://www.toymax.com, and found the person to talk with about resolving the issue.  Mr. Landi (no longer able to be contacted whether by choice or not with the company any longer) was quite helpful in assuring me that the camera itself was defective.  This was accompanied with the promise to e-mail proper representations of the photos that can be taken with the camera.

These photos never came.  Mr. Landi was more interested in another glitch, mainly the box itself I had.  The box most people received had images of a wrestler found on the accompanying CD-ROM shown in the distorted and enhance manner that the software was capable of.

(Excellent software I must add for editing, and putting background images with you're new blurry photos.)

The box I had showed a picture of a boy, apparently taken with this camera. The issue I raised was that if this was a representation of a consumer shot photograph and this is what I expected to get as an image.  His response was that I was lying and the box I have never was to go to print because of that issue.  I happily told him I would photocopy the box in color and send it to him.  I did so and never heard from him again, nor anyone who will acknowledge anything to do with camera issues.  I still have the box by the way and would happily scan and send copies to anyone who wishes to view the misleading and untruthful representation this camera shows.  

Not only is it a poor camera equal to a lump of coal in the Christmas stocking, but it's made by a company apparently afraid of litigation to the point where they will not even acknowledge any claims of a defective product.
