            My husband and I bought a Grand Vitara JLX in late July, and so far we love it. 

The engine is very quiet, and since it's a V6, it has plenty of power for an SUV in its class. The other SUV's we test-drove had 4 cylinder engines, and the difference in power is very noticeable. 

This is a more rugged 4x4 than other SUVs in its class; we've taken up some pretty rough and rugged dirt and gravel roads and had no trouble at all. However, the factory tires will not stand up to seriously rocky terrain, which we discovered on a mountain in the middle of nowhere. If you plan on doing any serious off-road (or really rocky gravel road) driving, get either off-road or on/off road tires. They're noisier on pavement, but it's a lot better than getting a flat.

It has a roomy interior in the front seats; the back seats are a little cramped, but better than the Kia Sportage we test-drove.  It also has a roomy cargo area, with loops for the optional cargo net. We've gone camping in in several times, with no difficulty hauling all our stuff around in it. The racks on top are also handy; we recently strapped a christmas tree to it, for example.  


The Grand Vitara also comes with some nice interior features, including a decent cassette/AM/FM radio, air conditioning, cruise control, and power door locks/power windows.  The seat cloth is pretty tough, as is the carpet.

Gas mileage is average with other SUVs in its class. The Grand Vitara isn't without some drawbacks. We've noticed that the metal its made out of, especially by the wheel wells, bends easier than we like. We had a gas attendent lean on the car to wash the windows, and it bent the metal enough to make the door not close. It's easy to fix, a body shop mechanic justs pops it back into place, but it's a pain in the neck nonetheless. The cruise control will turn off when you climb a steep hill, which will give you a little surprise.  The air vents in our Grand Vitara also leak when they're supposed to be closed. Most of these are small complaints though. Overall, the Grand Vitara has definitely been a good buy so far, and we've put 15,000 miles on it in four months.

UPDATE: Jan 20, 2000
Well, we had an accident in the Grand Vitara. The road we were travelling on had black ice (ice you can't see, for those who don't know)and was unsanded. We skidded and, due to the shape of the terrain on the other side of the road, rolled, landing upside down. My husband and I walked away without a scratch on us, just a single bruise each. I'm convinced the car kept us safe. Furthermore, the car is fixable. Apparently, the frame is sturdy enough to survive being rolled with just damage to the windshield and body panels.  I'll keep you posted on how it turns out after it is fixed.

UPDATE: March 22, 2000
We now have our car back, fixed. It looks great (largely due to the shop's talents), runs great, and there isn't anything noticeably different from before the wreck. What a great car!<br><br>
