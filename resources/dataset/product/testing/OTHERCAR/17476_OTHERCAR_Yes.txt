            Check bottom of opinion for updates [10/24/01]!!

My wife and two kids (and myself) have been looking for "Just the Right" minivan for some time now. We found it with the Kia Sedona LX. Primarily a "Dodge" family, our original intent was to buy a Caravan. 

The Caravan and Sedona both have similar base price ranges, but in order to compare apples-to-apples, you have to spend a considerable amount to load the Caravan up with options that the Kia already has. Bottom line, the Kia has a realistic retail price tag of about $3500 less than the Caravan.

The Sedona is longer that the short wheelbase Caravan, but shorter than the Grand Caravan. This was the perfect size for us, since the Grand Caravan was too long to fit in our garage.

My wife and I went to a local dealership, looked them over, and found them to be extremely nice. The "EX" model has a few extra options available, but also includes wood-grain and chrome interior trim which I (and my wife) personally found distasteful. The LX interior is silky smooth and simple. We went with the "LX" model specifically for the reason. Fortunately, the LX model is pretty much loaded with options as well. The only options not available on the LX that are available on the EX, is a sunroof, second row bucket seats (LX has a bench), two-tone paint schemes, a CD/Cassette (the LX has a cassette OR CD), and alloy rims. ABS brakes are an option on both. AC, power windows, tilt, cruise, dual sliding doors, tinted glass, and several other creature comforts are all STANDARD. Other than a few other minor differences, the EX and LX are close to the same. Cups holders and storage compartments are everywhere on both, although the EX has a few more. I'm still discovered "Basic Options" that I didn't know it had.

By going to www.kia.com, I was able to do some serious research and get quotes from several area dealerships. I was able to buy one for 3% over factory invoice and find the exact van in the color and with the options that we wanted. Our van ended up costing over $5000 less than what the MSRP was for a Caravan equipped roughly the same. 

Initial impressions: Powerful engine with lots of torque, loaded with "Real World" options that make life easier, easy and fun to drive, smooth ride and very comfortable. Flexible design. Extremely sensitive steering (power assisted rack & pinion). Some may see this as a plus. The handling is VERY responsive and gives you the impression that you're not driving a family vehicle. Takes a little while to get used to. Some of the components operate a bit different than what you might expect. The way lights operate, the way the power windows operate, the directions to turns keys and accessories, etc. I think it may be a Korean perspective.

The turning radius is tight, or at least tighter than I expected. Acceleration is sporty, more than what you would expect from a family vehicle. Smooth but powerful. Easily catch yourself speeding down the highway without realizing it. It "FEELS" like you are driving a vehicle that cost $40,000, not $20,000. Quality seems to be there and it shows.

Visibility is impressive. No excessive blind spots that are all too common with vans and minivans. Backing it up or slipping it into tight spots is no more difficult that your average mid-size car, maybe easier because of the driver perspective.

Headlights are VERY bright on "Bright" and actually extend outward to the sides a bit for full night time visibility. I like this, very much. The backing lights are quite bright too.

Only about 500 miles on it at the time of this review, so it is too early to comment on the long term satisfaction, but with a 100,000 mile warranty... I'm not worried. 

The things I WISH it had, but doesn't: Keyless/Remote entry. The radio has superb audio quality, but doesn't have a SEEK/SCAN function (fine for local presets, but what about vacation/travel?). Although I can't say I really miss them, I was somewhat surprised to see the visor mirrors don't help lights (however, the reading lights are more than adequate).

The only down side with our purchase was, at the time, Dodge offered a limited 0% financing. Kia was (and still is) 4.9%. But when you're saving thousands with the purchase price, you still come out ahead (you do the math). We paid $18092 not including the $595 destination charge, taxes and title/license fees. 

Check back periodically for updates as I will be providing additional information as it becomes available!

10/24/01: Our neighbor/friends liked our Kia so much and thought that it was such a great value, they bought one themselves. Primarily a Ford family, they said "The Windstar is just too much" and that you get more for your money with the Kia. They brought a Green EX model.

I think there may be a downside to this, as I predict that there will be lots of Kia Sedona minivans on the road within a couple years. When Dodge first came out with the Neon, I bought one because it was different and no one else had one. Now everyone has one. I bought a Durango for the same reasons (different!). I think the same may hold true for the Sedona. It's not a regret, but more of an observation.
