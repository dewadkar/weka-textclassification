            I have owned two Audi S4's. Both have been magnificent as daily drivers. Living in snow country one requires a full time four wheel drive car but most of the units available do not have satisfying performance. The Subaru's, while impressive and well made do not have the power output for sustained high speed driving common on the high desert in summer. The Porsche C4 while fabulous cars, there paint and trim is damaged easily in severe winter conditions.  
The Turbo'd Audi has been a perfect mix for these conditions. It's look is handsome without being extreme. With 227 horse available acceleration is good, 0-60 in just over 6 seconds. Handling is world class. A noted British test magazine stated the the S4 was virtually equal with the base 1995 Porsche 911 in speed and slalom courses. 
Of course in poor conditions the 4 wheel drive system is without peer. The entire experience is typical high end German speedfeel. Having said that if you want one and wish to have a good experience with it here are a couple of recomendations. 
Use high quality oil (Castrol Turbo or Syntech?) and change it frequently (3000 miles). Consider it cheap insurance. The mechanical bits on the fast Audi are well made but expensive. Get used to the idea of balancing the front wheels and tires about every 10,000 miles. The magnificent front end suspension which telegraphs every nuance of the road will also let you know every imperfection in alignment and wheel balance.
 I run Pirelli winter 210's in snow and P700's in summer. A small warning. Change to winter tires BEFORE you have to. This cars superb abilities will lull you into overdriving your summer tires in poor conditions.  You will have to look hard for a 1994-1995 S4 and expect to pay about 20k+ for a good one. It's money well spent.
