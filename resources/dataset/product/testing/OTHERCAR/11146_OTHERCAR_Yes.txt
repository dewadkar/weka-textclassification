            I am not a camera buff so this was very user friendly.  Since it was going to cost me almost as much to repair it as to replace it, I decided to try and purchase a new one when it went on the blink.  I was concerned I would just keep investing in a camera that might keep breaking down.  I might have had some responsibility in contributing to the breakdown.  I forgot several times to remove the lens when the zoom was trying to open, (I know, I know, what a dummy!) But that is what needs to be repaired. Because now sometimes the lens will open and when I am in the middle of using it, the lens will close for no reason. It now will not remove pictures from the memory stick.  The picture quality was good and everything else such as the software.  After reading some other reviews, it does sound like quality of the actual camera is questionable.  After looking at replacements that are similar though, I am tempted to repair it and take my chances anyway because it was so easy to use and understand. When asked if I would recommend this to a friend, I said yes, but I would have to say with warnings about durability.
