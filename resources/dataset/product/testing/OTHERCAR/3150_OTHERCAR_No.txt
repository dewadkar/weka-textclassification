            My decision to purchase a Hyundai Elantra 2000 model was based on the price of the vehicle as well as the 10 year warranty. Little did I know however, that the vehicle would have transmission problems within eight months after being purchased new. The original transmission went completely and had to be replaced with little more than five thousand miles on it. Several weeks later, the replacement transmission began malfunctioning. After having a valve within the transmission replaced, I am still experiencing similar problems with the vehicle. A source from the dealership informed me that Hyundai Corporation is aware of the transmission problems in the new models, however, were reluctant to disclose the information, to the public, fearing numerous recalls. At present, I am going through an arbitration process with the Better Business Bureau. I am fighting to have the dealership repurchase the vehicle and refund me all money I invested in it. I feel that as a consumer I have been completely misled. The commercial for the Elantra claims &quot;You don't have to worry about your car for TEN YEARS!&quot; As an owner of the new Elantra, experiencing nothing but problems with the car, I had to share my experience here so others will know the truth. I hope that after reading my story, you will share this information with everyone you know. Most importantly, educate yourself prior to buying a new car. If it peace of mind and quality assurance is important to you as it is to me then paying an extra two to five thousand dollars is worth it!  <br><br>
