            I own a Toyota Camry. To recommend this car is like recommending you bring home a nice, sweet girl home to meet Momma, as opposed to a Sunday Dinner at your Grandma's with your date &quot;The Last of the Red Hot Lovers&quot;

The car is so well made I don't want to put the a Voodoo Jinx on it, but it has had nothing ,but basic servicing( tune up , oils changes) for the past 5 years.   I owned other cars and believe me I sleep with an american flag under my pillow at night , but the Japanese know something about making a car.  Those in the know will tell me AH- but the Toyota is American made- it is , but the majority of the car, it's working essentials are made in Japan.  I had a Chevy , brand new- broke the first week I had it.  Water Pump blew.  That is another tale of woe.

I have the souped up model, 4 doors, air conditioning, great sound system,  anti lock brakes,  the fancy door locks and electric windows.  One super feature, I adore this. You can open all four door with the driver's side key.  Wonderful.  The kids have library books, soaking wet from the rain, I can let them in from my side.

The car seats are super comfortable.  There is enough leg room for the biggest guys.

There is also plenty of cup holders, and a nice holder for sunglasses or garage door opener.  The air conditioner will keep you nice and chilly through  the summer too. I also bought the beautiful wood trim option. This really adds a little spice to the car.

Power in this car is unreal.  I can pass all those sexy truck drivers with ease.  It just has fabulous pick up.  The gas mileage isn't bad either. On long trips , I can go from New York to Boston on one tank of gas.  Bet you can't compete with that in your Rolls Royce, so there.

Just for fun, I revved up the engine and took my foot off the gas and wanted to see how long I could coast .  Warning , don't try this on the freeway.  I actually went almost two miles before the car came to a halt.

The car has wonderful trunk space,  if I can tote enough baseball equipment for a team of 15 seventeen year old boys, just think what you can put in this thing.

I adore the car so much - I just bought another Toyota.  An Echo,  adore that too.  If you want a car that is dependable, will be there through thick and thin,  buy the Toyota...although it won't turn any heads with it's non-sexy style,  it will turn you into a Toyota believer.
