            This camera has proven to be a workhorse in capturing vivid photo's with no hassle.  Fairly compact although a bit weighty, the DC200 takes nice photo's that are bright in color and very many instances does not require any software enhancements.  The images are very crisp and clear.  The camera comes with a view panel that allows you to see your preferences.  It has easy to navigate menu options giving you choices on resolution/storage space. You can use the views screen to &quot;see&quot; what you see or turn it off so that you use the traditional viewfinder to aim at your subject. It uses a compact flash card so you never have to worry about having a computer nearby to flush images before being able to take more.  The response is very quick from shutter pressure to saving to memory.  

The camera comes with all the necessary cables and hookups - you may want to invest in a card reader which will speed up download of images to your computer.  It uses standard 'AA' batteries but I highly recommend you carry plenty of extra's especially if you download images frequently or don't have an AC adapter - it does tend to use up batteries quickly.<br><br>
