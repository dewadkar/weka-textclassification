            I bought this truck in a year end clearance sale,  needed something to replace my gas-sucking, falling apart 1994 Jeep Cherokee 4.0L.  I live in Michigan and the Winter could be driving hell.. sometimes 3 feet of snow on the road.  

HERE ARE THE CONS:

When winter arrived and the 3 feet of snow came, I went out to test my tracker in the snow.  I switched it to 4 wheel drive, I reversed out then selected drive.  I stepped on the gas and...i'm not even moving.  I was stuck, finding myself extremely embarrassed when a Older model Ford Taurus passed me.  The rear wheels were only spinning and the front wheels were dead!  After 15 minutes, i rocked my self out then tried again.  This time it worked.  I found out that the blasted Transfer case needed to be driven at least 5 minutes to get warmed up for maximum 4 wheel power, the Jeep in the other hand never needed to be warmed up.

It clearly stated in the manual that you could shift into 4 wheel drive while moving under 50 Miles per hour and with the steering wheel straight.  Yeah right, did what the manual said.  The knob wouldn't bust while it was moving.  I always had to stop then shift into 4 wheel drive.

The 4 speed Automatic Transmission is always confused.  When I slow done then press the pedal to gain speed, you could feel the transmission wondering what gear to select, you could feel at least three gears wanted to be selected for 2 seconds.

Poor highway engine performance.  Its comfortable riding at 70 Miles per hour, but if there is a slight rush of air, the transmission selects 3rd gear and the RPM meter changes to 5,500.

I've had two defects so far.  The radiator hose tightening clamps were loose, spilling radiator fluid all over the engine's pulleys.  Result was annoying noise in the pulley's.  After 3 times to the dealership, the noise is eliminated.

When the steering wheel is on a certain angle, the turn signal knob sometimes gets stuck.

HERE ARE THE PROS:

The engine is fuel efficient around town and on the highway for a SUV.  The handling is good thanks to the strut tower bar that available on the previous Trackers.  Engine performance while off-roading is great.  I've gone off-road in deep mud and manage to get out.  The engine is quite and smooth. Standard CD Player Unit is nice but the speakers are extremely weak and suggest to get better speakers.


You're probably thinking that this SUV is unreliable. All cars are made differently and everybody will get a better or worse automobile, because a model is not all made perfectly.
