            When I decided in July 1998 to buy myself a digital camera I conducted a lot of research. I found an excellent site that allows you to compare pictures from different cameras side-by-side (www.imaging-resource.com). I was looking for the best performance at a reasonable price, and something that would not be totally obsolete in 6 months.

I chose the DC-210 based on its excellent array of features- zoom lens, adjustable exposure value, LCD display, CompactFlash memory card, TV out, 1152x864 pixel resolution. Plus the colors looked a lot better than any other camera in it's price range.

For people shots, indoors and out, this camera is a champ. Color renditions are great, the auto-flash does the trick, and for indoor darkened room shots the anti-redeye feature works well. Any close shots are better than I expected for the money. However, Kodak settled for a fixed-focus lens on the DC-210 that just does not cut it for distance shots (that is- anything over 50 feet). Landscape photos will disappoint, especially objects with sharp features like buildings- pictures without man-made objects will leave a better impression. Another important limitation- digital cameras are notoriously poor at capturing contrast, nowhere near the ability of film. The DC-210 is no better, backlit objects will be dark, and &quot;pushing&quot; the Exposure Value will help your subject, but result in washed out backgrounds.

Other disappointments- battery life is poor, especially if you use the LCD for reviewing shots. Beware of using close-up macro mode, it turns the LCD into a video display and literally kills batteries! Investing in rechargeables was a good idea for me. Saving the photo takes 6-10 seconds, so forget about multiple sequential shots, and the viewfinder does not show what the camera lens sees, it is not even close so framing your shots is  tricky. 

The ergonomics of this camera are it's worst feature. If you look through the viewfinder with your right eye your nose inevitably rubs on the LCD screen. Skin oils are very difficult to remove! Holding the camera does not come naturally, which might explain why newer Kodaks are completely redesigned.

However, for all my complaining I still have it and use it. I have taken over 1000 photos with it, and as long as you understand the limitations it does the job.<br><br>
