            Despite the long time it took me to get this camera I am very glad I chose to buy it.  I decided to purchase the Kodak DC-240 after I got my first digital camera last Christmas.  The first camera was not USB compatible, which I needed, so I returned it and decided to go with the DC-240.  I am very happy with it.  Unlike the first digital camera I was able to learn how to take pictures with it very easily.  Within 5 minutes of opening the box I was taking pictures.  I have found that this camera takes great pictures indoors and out.  It's a 1.2 megapixel camera and has all kinds of cool features.  Kodak made this camera with the idea of allowing the user to customize their pictures.  You are able to add borders to pictures, add effects (like sepia toning), and much more.  Another great thing about this camera is the battery life.  A big concern with digital cameras is battery life.  No one wants a camera whose battery life is non existent.  I have been taking a heavy amount of pictures the past two weeks,with the LCD display on (which usually wipes out battery life, and the batteries are still kicking.  Kodak sets you up so well with this camera that when your batteries do run out they included rechargable batteries and a charger.  How great is that!?  As a current college student living the dorm life I have found this camera as being a great alternative to film based cameras.  I don't have to deal with batteries, film, or development.  I love it and highly recommend it!<br><br>
