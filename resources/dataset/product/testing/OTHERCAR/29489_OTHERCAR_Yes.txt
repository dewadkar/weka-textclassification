            Not a bad camera. You have the option to get it in different colors. Mine is green. ;) Only really bad thing is that it eats batteries very quick, so always have a couple spare sets when you go out. If you are primarily taking pictures for online use, this is a great camera for the price. Easy to use, lots of features, great quality online photos.  The best price I've found on the internet is $440.  This is a rather lightweight camera which will make replacing a regular Advantix or 35 mm camera easy.  You can use it both with a PC and a Mac, allowing me to visit my grandma and download pictures on to her IMac with just a small software installation.  Included features on this camera have proved invaluable for me.  Off the box it says there theres an  Automatic Flash, Manual Flash (on/off), Red-eye reduction, AND a Self Timer!  Digital photos don't even need to be retouched after the efficient Red eye reduction!  Go to www.kodak.com for more information on getting this great camera!
