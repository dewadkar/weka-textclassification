            I purchased a used 1995 Cosmos Black M3 Lux in May 2000 for $25k. The car had 33k miles on it and was - and still is - in mint condition. A year and 14k miles later, I'm really glad I made this purchase. I have had to do nothing except change the oil. 

Initially, I was thinking of purchasing a new Toyota Camry or Honda Accord. Both these cars are top performers but in retrospect, I'm happy I didn't succumb to the boring sensibility of driving either of these cars. It's like comparing Panasonic phones with Bang &Olufsen phones. The Panasonics are awesome phones but lack the 'oomph' that the B&O possesses :)

The M3 really grew on me. Very crisp ride, swift acceleration, stop-on-a-dime brakes, superb feel, and of course the looks! Nothing in the car has malfunctioned so far and I hope it stays that way. The only thing I need to change is the plastic water pump impeller that is prone to failing, as per the many posts I've read on BMW forums. The 96 1/2 and newer M3s come with a metal impeller. Another annoying problem is that the clutch pedal squeaks. This has been observed by other M3 owners as well. A few drops of lube silences the squeaking for 2-3 months but then it comes back. A permanent fix requires some after-market parts to be incorporated into the clutch pedal. There is a slight rattle that has started from the car cabin but I'm confident that it will be relatively easy to find and fix. Oh yes, the only thing I'm not too pleased with, is the sound system. Unless you have the Harmon Kardon system in the M3, you'll want to change the stock system.

If you're really passionate about your car, the stock 1995 M3 should be your toy because there are tons of modifications you can make on this car. Mine is stock and I haven't made any mods but that's because I don't have that kind of time.
