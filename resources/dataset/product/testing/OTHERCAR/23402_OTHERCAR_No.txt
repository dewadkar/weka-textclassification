            The 1987 Mercedes 560SL is an example of what the older  would-be sports driver used to dream of and now they can afford it.  You can pick up an SL of this age in wonderful condition for about $20,000.  Most of the SLs are in wonderful condition because they were so expensive to begin with that owners took care of them.  The 86/87 models is not a classic and probably never will be so there will not be a magical increase in value.  That does not keep it from giving pleasurable driving and a little dreaming.

Most of these models come with two tops.  The soft top which folds down into a space behind the miniature back seat.  It is an easy top to put up and down.  The Mercedes top is not line.  However, there is a great looking hard top which takes at least two people to install or uninstall.  While you are doing this you are in great danger of ruining your paint job.

I live in a retirement mecca and Mercedes are thick on the ground here and so are the sporty SLs driven by the silver hairs.  All men, by the way.  There is a reason for that.  The SLs were built for the American market and they made them for the big fellas.  I am 5 feet 2 and require at least three pillows to see over the dashboard.  The seat adjustments are not as variable as the new Mercedes models.  The 560SLs  are heavy feeling cars to drive and probably not be described as a womans car unless she liked big trucks.  However, the men I see driving them look very pleased with themselves.  As a passenger, I like the car.

Luggage room is minimal so you learn to travel light.  There are sets of fitted luggage available but that wouldn't provide much more packing room.  The back seat is suitable for more luggage.  With the new seat belt requirements, you couldn't even stuff a two year old back there.

We have taken this car on long road trips with only one scare.  We were on the beltway of a midwest city during the morning rushhour when suddenly all the instruments went out.  The car kept running smoothly and it appeared to be a fuse problem.  We pulled into a shopping mall parking lot and sure enough it was a fuse problem.  There were extra fuses in the plastic bag containing the fuse diagram.  Ten minutes and we were on our way.  

I have seen younger men driving these cars.  When I was working I saw several who drove them to work daily, so it's not just the graylocks that like the SLs.

We bought ours from a friend.  We are its third loving owners.  It's an advantage to know the previous owner and have the car checked out by a trusted mechanic.
