            My Grandmother recently bought a 1999 Cadillac Deville. My grandparents' cars have bared the Cadillac name since 1967 when they bought there first Cadillac.  They have been pleased with every single one.  
This most recent adoption of a Cadillac was exceptionally pleasing.  The Leather is absolutely beautiful, and the ride is exceptional.  They also enjoy the digital dash display.  
The one thing that seems to get my attention is the fact that even with the V-8 power, the car still gets great gas mileage, 22 mpg in the city and has gotten as much as 30 mpg on the highway.
When they first bought it, I drove it and absolutely fell in love with the way it drove.  It still had the big car feel, but it felt good.  The stereo in it sounded great as well.
If you are looking for a great car, get a Caddy!
