            <i>This is a continuation of the first epinion I wrote on the <b>2000 Kia Sephia</b>.  Please take a look at it at this address: <a href='/auto-review-4136-84971F6-39BAE73C-prod1'>http://www.epinions.com/auto-review-4136-84971F6-39BAE73C-prod1</a></i>

I had my rental car for about one week.  The day that I was supposed to bring it back to get my brand new car, my mother got a call from the dealership after five.  They said that there was no way that they could get me a brand new car because the lemon was already titled.  I was heartbroken, angry, and shocked.

After all I went through already, they were going to make me drive a lemon.  So, I took the rental car home and my mother and I sat down and decided what to do next.  We pondered that for 2 days.  I emailed a nasty letter to Kia.  My mother spoke directly to Kia, the manager of the dealership, the service manager, and the salesman who sold us the lemon.  

This is part of the letter I emailed to Kia: �The dealership has continuously lied to us and mislead us.  In addition to all this, they charged us for a CD player when I don't even have one.  We put $1000 down and on the paperwork it said only $566.  There was a double-down deal, and that is nowhere to be seen.  We are out a significant amount of money, and what do we get for all the time we wasted driving back and forth to the dealership so many times.  I had to go after work, and my drive to the dealership from my work takes an hour.  Do that as many times as I have, and you would be fed up also.�

Finally, they decided to get me a brand new car.  But, that also meant filling out all that paperwork again.  This time I brought my friend who helped me figure out all the correct numbers.  We got the salesman to bring down the price so that I can now own it.  Two days later, I got to take my brand new shiny red car with a spoiler home.  

The car does not normally come with a CD player in it, so my salesman had someone come out to my house and install one before I left for work.  When I first turned it on, it sounded really horrible.  There was buzzing and echoes.  I waited a week for the person to come back out to look at it.  The speaker is blown.  So, then I took it back to the dealership since everything is under warranty.  Except this.  Since this radio was put in after the car came from the factory, supposedly it is not under the warranty.  I will definitely remedy this slight problem with the service manager.

Here is some further information on the car that I did not provide you in my last review:

The 1.8 liter, 16-valve, multi-port, fuel injected power plant cranks out 125 horsepower. Comfort items include a dual cupholder, map pockets, tinted glass and remote releases for the hood, trunk and fuel door.  Now, that�s what I call heaven.  The cupholder is just perfect for holding my 24 oz water bottle and the door pockets are just perfect for my sunglasses case.  It is roomy in the front and back and the ride is quiet, almost like the car isn�t even moving.  I don�t have to blast my radio when it is thundering and pouring outside anymore.  

Even after all the problems I�ve had with this car, I would buy it again.  Just at a different dealership.

If you are looking for a good, inexpensive car, check this one out.
