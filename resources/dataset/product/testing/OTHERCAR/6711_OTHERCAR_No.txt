            When deciding to purchase a newer vehicle, I immediately went to my Chevy dealer.  I had previously purchased a 1992 Caprice from them and loved the car.  They had no Caprices available, the model being discontinued in 1996, so the salesman showed me the Lumina.  I'll have to say, it is a very sharp looking car!  I test drove it and around town, it will serve the purpose of getting you around.  I bought the car, and about a month later took it on an extended road trip.  Boy, was I ever disappointed!  Equipped with a 3.1 liter engine, I expected extremely good gas mileage.  Much to my surprise, I got worse road mileage than I had gotten with my Caprice, which had a 5.0 liter engine!  To make things worse, this engine has no power - in the Rocky Mountains, mini-vans were passing me on the steep upgrades!  Also, for extended trips, the room in the Lumina leaves much to be desired.  I am not an amazon - I am only 5'6&quot; tall and I was uncomfortable with the leg room.  The main problem is that the front wheel wells intrude into the cab of the vehicle.  My son, at 6 feet tall was really uncomfortable in the rear seat.  My husband is 6'2&quot; and was not comfortable in the front or rear.  In my opinion, if you want a sharp looking car to get around in locally, you could do worse than the Lumina.  However, if you spend a lot of time traveling, look elsewhere.<br><br>
