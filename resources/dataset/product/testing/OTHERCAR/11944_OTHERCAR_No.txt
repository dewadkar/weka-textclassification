            Hey I have taken some super PICS with this little camera. &quot;Great bang for the buck&quot; if the software was compatible.  Four separate settings for resolution, takes super PICS but half of the time the image cannot be recognized by the software. To verify the fact I have taken the camera and the interface cable to 3 separate computers and each had malfunctions using the supplied software. Half of the time I cannot load the camera into the database. The camera responds with a double beep and is recognized by the computer but it cannot be loaded into the database. All other programs work great, the only problem is the software that is supplied as an accessory by AGFA with the camera. What good is any camera if it is unreliable? The price is right, the PICS are good quality when it can be loaded into the computer.<br><br>
