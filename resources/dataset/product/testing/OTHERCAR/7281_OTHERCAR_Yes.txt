            After months of searching the net for a camera that would fit my needs, I finally decided on the Olympus D-460. This was to be my first Digital camera and I wanted something that would last a few years while I learned how to use one but I did not want one that I would be bored with with-in six months either. 

I chose the Olympus D-460 for the following reasons:

First and foremost, I wanted a Megapixel camera. The Olympus D-460 has 1.3 Megapixels and to be frank is now a fairly low resolution for today�s standards but it is good enough to print out a photo off your printer if you so chose to do so. 

I wanted a LCD screen so that I could edit and delete on the spot. However, I must admit you need to be good at the game twister to see the LCD screen outside. I have found myself in some pretty weird positions trying to see the screen.

The camera came with NiMH batteries. I LOVED these batteries till they went dead (about 3 weeks). Now I am on the scramble for rechargeable batteries and a charger to go with it. I also have been thinking about getting an AC adapter for when I download the pictures. The charger was $20.00, the batteries were $12.00 and the AC adapter �. Who knows I have not looked yet. So this is an added cost I had not really did my homework on.  

I purchased my camera off of an auction and was able to get an extra 16mb smartmedia card for $445.00. All in all Im happy with my purchase. The camera comes with lots of bells and whistles that I will probably never use. I can ring a bell just as good as the next (Joe) but never did learn how to whistle.

Might I suggest something? If purchasing a camera with a LCD is in your future you must buy a camera case. I have not done that yet and spend a lot of time worrying that it is going to get scratched.
