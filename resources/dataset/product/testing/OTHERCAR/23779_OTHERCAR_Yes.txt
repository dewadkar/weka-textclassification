            <b>"If you're trying to get somewhere in life, you need plans, and a car. The ECHO can help...It gets you there,"</b> states Toyota in its online advertisement for this vehicle, and I couldn't agree more.

I recently acquired a <b>used year 2000 model ECHO</b> in very good condition. It had only a few minor scratches on the exterior and a couple of stains on the fabric on the rear interior.

The driving reasons behind my choice for picking this car were price, gas mileage, and reliability. Since I was trading in a Toyota Tercel, and this was the upgrade from the Tercel, it made sense to take a serious look at the car.

I took it out for a test drive. When I explained to the salesman that it was my first test drive ever, he got a very nervous look in his eyes and seemed to bring things to a close sooner than I think he would have normally done so. In the past I usually bought cars simply after sitting in them and saying, "I'll take it."

I immediately noticed that it handled very well on turns, and had more power on hills with its <b>peppy '1.5L I4 Engine,'</b> than my former Tercel had. <b>The 'manual 5-speed transmission' was an added plus</b> also, since my old Tercel did not have that extra fifth gear which must have given it the extra "juice" (I know very little about cars).

When I got the car back to the lot, I did all the standard things a guy should do so as not to look like a complete idiot. I kicked the tires, looked under the hood (as if I knew the difference between the A/C and the Air Filter), checked the wipers and the lights, and the lighter (which did not work although I thought it did- but I don't smoke anyway).

After that, I felt successfully "in control" of the whole matter and ready to make a DEAL, only to find out that <b>I was at a SATURN Used-Car dealership, and they DON'T make deals with anyone. Their prices are fixed and not negotiable. Oh-well.</b>

I have had my ECHO for a few months now and it has served me well. You may not believe me, but <b>on "strict highway" mileage, I get up to 48mpg</b>, and <b>on average city mileage I get about 31-36mpg</b>. I have been monitoring this for months with very little variance.

I am over 6" tall, and yet I have plenty of head-room even when I have a hat on, but as I stated, the height of this car gives it the shape of something like a VW Bug. Therefore, it does get wobbly on sharp turns or in high winds. I tend to drive slower in both conditions.

<b>One complaint I have is that the interior hardware parts are somewhat cheap.</b> Take the window handles for example: they are inferior to the point that they feel as if they might break off if not handled gently.

I like the central console, which has 3 places for cups, BUT does not have a hide-away for spare change. The glove compartment is creatively designed in 2 stages, with the upper section opening upwards and the larger lower section  opening downwards.

While I have not yet pulled over to a rest-stop, and slept in the driver side 'velour/cloth' bucket seat, it is only a matter of time. These seats are very comfortable! In addition, the Am/Fm/CD Disc player worked like a charm, with 4 speakers to surround me with great sound.

The brakes seem very solid, and the new design of the headlights allow for replacement with removal of only 2 or 3 screws instead of over 10 on the old Tercel. While the wipers are nice, they are of odd sizes. One is long and one is short-- that always annoys me a tad.

The body style is shaped somewhere between a Ford Focus and a VW Beetle, but is much closer to the Focus and sits a bit high. This allows you to get in and out of the car with ease, without feeling as if you are climbing out from low riding wheelbarrow. It also sits higher in the back, and makes for tougher tire changing, since you need to lift the rear end even higher to get the wheel off the rim to swap off a flat tire. <b>Trunk space even after hiding the spare tire, was very generous.</b>

I have faith that this automobile will be as reliable as my last Toyota, and will last just as long (150,000) or longer, and with few problems. I rarely needed service on my Tercel- it was a 1993 with its original timing belt, and only its second battery.

<b>I hope I keep hearing the ECHO's engine keep going and going, like the Eveready Battery Bunny! Thump!-Thump! Thump!-Thump!</b>
