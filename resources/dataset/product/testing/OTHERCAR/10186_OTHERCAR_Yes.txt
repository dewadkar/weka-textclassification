               The 2000 Lexus RX 300 is the nicest Sport Utility Vehicle I have ever drove.  The comfort is unbelievable, the stereo system is great, there is a sun roof, and it is remarkably fast and quiet. I love everything about the 2000 Lexus RX 300, there is nothing to hate.  The only thing I would improve on is the selection of different colors, it is very limited.  Driving this vehicle is very smooth, comfortable and quiet.  This vehicle is suited for most anyone.It is probably best suited for a person between the ages of 30-55. I suggest you buy this vehicle as quickly as possible, its like driving a dream.  The Lexus RX 300 is very expensive, but it is well worth it.<br><br>
