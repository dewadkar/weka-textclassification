            The Honda Crv is not really a full fledged SUV. It's more like a raised city car. It's great though because It's comfortable, spacious, and remarkably easy to drive. 
 You can seat 4 adults in the back and not feel too uncomfortable for drives lasting 1, 1.5 hours even.
 I once fit 9 people in this car - when I really had to. We survived the 40 minute drive.
 The engine's pretty good - decent acceleration at low speeds.
 Handling's excellent - this doesn't feel like a truck - I guarantee that. It's nimble and quick - takes corners easily (at low speeds - I'll talk more about this later) and parks very comfortably.
  The inside of this car feels much bigger than it is outside.
 There's ample luggage room for a family of five as well.

The downside -
    Now if you're an agressive driver  - this car's not too great.
 It's a tad underpowered and not too stable taking turns at high speed. Not too aerodynamic either so the top speed's quite limited. If you're sitting in the back seat and an agressive driver is behind the wheel ,  you'll get really annoyed ( I do ) because sudden movements (acceleration/hard braking, and bumps) feel amplified.
  
   Actually  - parents - if you're looking for a car your kids may drive once in a while and you want to control their speed habits - this car'll do it.  You cant push it too hard - you feel it tilting when you make smooth turns at over 60 kph and like all Hondas - the body is kinda flimsy so they must control themselves .. I know I have to . 
  My mom LOVES this car.  I'm ok with it , dont love it all that much because I can't drive as aggressively as I'd like to sometimes, and acceleration at medium speeds (100-130 Kph) is not awesome.
 
  Overall great car though . Thumbs up.
