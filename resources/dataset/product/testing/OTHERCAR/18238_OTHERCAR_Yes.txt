            I bought a used '94 Volvo 850 turbo in December, 1997. I chose to buy a Volvo because I hadn't driven in 7 years while I was urban and carless and safety was my primary concern as I was afraid of getting behind the wheel at all. The first thing you learn when getting to know Volvo is that safety is the most important theme. Sometimes this is even overstated, as in the time the sales person told me that the impressive 0-60 MPH acceleration was a &quot;safety feature&quot; to assist me in merging and zooming away from dangerous drivers. 

In fact, the Volvo does make you feel safe and this car gives you the feeling that it is your friend, not your enemy, as my previous autos had been. It is fast, handles very well and is full of luxury (read: unnecessary) features such as seat warmers, dual temperature controls, and an &quot;economy&quot; driving setting that appears to have no effect on fuel consumption.  In terms of maintenance, it is not cheap, but not many things seem to break either.  When they do, of course, like the tempermental electrical system, they are never covered under the V.I.P. warranty that set me back $1,500 on purchase.

The two only drawbacks to this wonderful car:  fuel economy is not good (my &quot;onboard computer&quot; tracks it at 21 MPG highway) and a stiff ride.  My tires wore out quickly but I was delighted to receive a check for $500 from a class action settlement against Michelin that I knew nothing about. 

One final point:  the car is huge inside because it is designed with maximum cabin space for that car size. Buy this car!<br><br>
