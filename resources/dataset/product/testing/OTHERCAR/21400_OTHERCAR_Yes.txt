            My wife and I recently leased a Camry LE and immediately fell in love with it.  The V6 engine (which I highly recommend)has plenty of power (especially when passing on two lane roads). The Camry handles the road wonderfully (believe me, I live in rural Louisiana, and our roads bite). With safety features like dual air bags and anti-lock brakes, I feel safe no matter what the road conditions.  And being a new father, that is important to me.  The reliability of the vehicle is second to none.  In the two years we have had the car, we have not had any problems with it.  Not even a loose screw.  On a scale from one to ten, I give this car an 11.  Buy it, drive it, love it.<br><br>
