            I factory ordered a new 1997 Pontiac Sunfire and took delivery on 2/27/97.

I bought this vehicle because of the low cost of purchasing and financing:  I got it for $100 over invoice and 3.9% GMAC financing.

I love the way the optional big four cylinder 2.4L DOHC 16 valves engine performs with the stick shift.  This power plant has plenty of power for this vehicle,  particularly on the low end of the RPM scale (lots of low-end torque for great getaway power from a stop light).  Most of the smaller cars from the far east will deliver their power at the higher end of the RPM scale,  so it is a matter of preference.  The standard 2.2L SOHC 8 valves engine is a real laggard,  so I didn't get it.  I also like the sporty appearance of the car.

I hate the lack of reliability.  This car has been towed back to the dealer 5 times,  and has had the following parts replaced during the warranty period:  catalytic converter, oil pump, water pump, front brakes (3 times), ignition coil, rack_and_pinion_steering_gear box, stereo, interior seat trim, and it has had 2 safety recalls (rear suspension and airbags).  It is now about 3,000 miles out of warranty and it still has problems with the steering and brakes.  I hate the fact that GM was unwilling to replace this vehicle with another Sunfire.

This vehicle is fun to drive with the optional bigger engine and manual transmission.  The manual transmission is not a smooth shifter - sometimes u have to &quot;rock and roll&quot; the stick into your selected gear - but otherwise it is a very fun to drive car.

I do not believe that anybody should buy this vehicle - not new nor used.  Build quality is very spotty on this model and if you get stuck with a bad copy then it will turn out to be a very big nightmare over the 3 year 36 month warranty period and beyond.  The new car buyer with a limited budget should consider a used imported model with a better reliability record if they do not mind the high-end torque of these imported far eastern models.

P.S. - For the record - I am not a paid reviewer.<br><br>
