            We bought this car as a used program car with 50,000 miles on it just over 2 years ago and have put 30,000 trouble free miles on it. It has the 2.5 liter 4 cylinder engine which has more than enough power on flat ground and has no problem with hills even with 4 people in it. On the highway we get around 34 mpg and in combination city and highway driving get around 28 mpg. Our one and only complaint so far is with the paint. The car is grey and the paint on the hood and roof is flaking off. This, I have been told was a common problem in the early 90's with grey and blue paint.

The interior is roomy and it also has a roomy trunk. The 60-40 bench seats are comfortable, but power seats would give you better adjustment. The car drives good, with good engine response and the 3 speed automatic transmission shifts very smooth.

I highly recommend this car to anyone looking for cheap, dependable transportation, but avoid grey or blue unless the car has been repainted-or get the price lowered and get it done yourself at a reliable body shop.<br><br>
