            We bought our suburban used in early 1999.  It had about 107,000 miles on it, but was in immaculate condition.  It is black with leather and all the options except the roof rack.  We bought this one because we needed a three quarter ton to pull our trailer, but we wanted the 350ci engine for gas millage.  This has worked to some degree, it pulls our trailer fine exccept for hills where it really dogs down.  The gas millage is not as good as we had hoped when not towing, we get about 13-15 mpg, 9-11 towing. I have heard that you can get the close to the same for towing with the 454ci engine.
Since we have owned it we have had to replace the exhaust from the catalitic converter back. I reccomend getting the flowmaster setup and also open up the Y pipe for better exhuast flow.  This really made a difference in the performance ie. it's a lot more peppy.  We also had to replace the intake manifold gasket which we found out is common.  When they were doing that they discovered that some of the heater line valves were plugged and had to be replaced.  So it's always a good idea to have your radiator flushed and coolant changed on a regular basis.  I just recently put shocks all the way around.  We put monroe sensatracs on the front and loadhandlers with the spring coil on the back.  This really helped keep the back end from sagging when we are towing and the ride is really smooth for such a stiff shock.
Things that we haven't fixed yet: the wipers cut out (I think this is because of a loose contact, I don't know. I have used a zip tie to keep the contacts tight and so far it has worked.  GM wants a $100 to fix it.) The air conditioner motor is making a really weird noise, so we unplugged it. Hope to have it fixed by next summer. Finally we need new tires.
All in all it's a great rig and my wife and kids love it. <br><br>
