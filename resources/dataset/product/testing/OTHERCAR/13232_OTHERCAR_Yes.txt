            We love our Plymouth Grand Voyager!  It's great for the whole family - the kids, grandparents and us with room to haul luggage too!  We purchased this van as a 3rd vehicle but I am now driving it all the time - it's easy and fun to drive.  If you need or want lots of room - this is the van for you! 
We have the bench seats which we've moved the 3 person seat to the front but unfortunately the 2 person seat doesn't fit in the back.  But it did what we needed it to do.  
We've taken this on 2 long trips - one was 13 hours and the other 19 hours and it was very comfortable on both.  (Even with 2 young children)  There are 2 plugs available - we purchased a tv/vcr for the trip and this worked out well.
