            This is a great vehicle!  We have two boys and already have an SUV.  The Cruiser is a great second car for a family.  The doors open wide so it's easy to get kids in and out of and unlike an SUV, you don't have to lift kids way up and in to get them into their car seats.  

The Cruiser is also incredibly versatile.  The storage space in the back is great - bigger than most minivans and easily adapts to your needs with the movable shelf that fits into at least 5 positions.  Also, the back seats fold up or come out like a minivan for extra hauling ability.  The front passenger seat even folds down!  

The controls up front are well laid out and the seats are comfortable.  There is lots of room for what is otherwise a short car due to its height.  

Beyond the basic features, the Cruiser is the ultimate head turner.  It gets more looks and comments than most other hot models that are twice the price or more.  If you are looking for a vehicle that has unique styling, you can't bring yourself to buy a minivan or stationwagon but still want a practical car, the Cruiser is for you.<br><br>
