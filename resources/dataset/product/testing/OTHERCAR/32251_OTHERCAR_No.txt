            I have a swift and have had a consistent lack of power since the day i bought it.  I understand that the 1800cc engine is not meant to produce 200hp. But at least it should climb a 2% grade!  Even after the car has had sufficient time to warm up it still has no power.  When I say no power I mean that if you put your foot to the floor the car actually stalls instead of moving. I have adjusted the timing, changed the wires and plugs, had it tuned up and even had a computer diagnostic report done on it.  Nothing has turned up a fault in the working mechanisms of the car, it just sucks on the power!  A car that weighs as little as the swift should zip in and out of traffic with ease when powered by 1800cc's. I also own a fiat that is powered by the same engine and it has more than enough power.  Unlike the swift, my Fiat has a carburator instead of fuel injection and should not have as much power.  It seems to me that suzuki didn't even try to test the power plant in this car. Its almost as if this car was meant to just be a disposable rip-off car.<br><br>
