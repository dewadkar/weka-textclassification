            I have been the owner of my Subaru Forester for about a year now.  When making my decision as to what kind of car I was going to purchase, I decided the weather in Colorado (snow and ice) was a good reason to get an SUV over a sports car.  Plus, I wanted something relatively roomy -- something I can transport &quot;things&quot; around in.  I've driven my father's Ford Explorer -- which is a nice ride but a larger SUV than I was looking for.  I test drove some Jeep Cherokees and Wranglers as well, but I wanted a smoother ride.  But the ads for the Subaru Forester are right:  it's an SUV that drives like a car!  The Forester was perfect for my needs:  a small SUV with a smooth ride, enough storage capacity for moving things around, and AWD -- all-wheel drive -- all of the time (no need to switch between 2WD &amp; 4WD, as the cases were w/ both the Explorer and the Cherokees).  This vehicle is most idea for single people (or couples) who want the comfort and safety of all-wheel drive, want to be able to haul or load up their stuff without getting a big, bulky, rough-driving SUV, and want a ride that's smooth and gets decent gas mileage (20 - 23 mpg -- much better than the Explorer's 15 - 17 mpg).<br><br>
