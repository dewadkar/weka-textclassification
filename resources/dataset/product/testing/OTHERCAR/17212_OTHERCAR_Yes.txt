            For anyone looking to venture into the world of digital cameras, you cannot go wrong with the Pentax Optio 33L.  This camera is packed with so many features that even camera enthusiasts will enjoy this camera.  What is truly surprising is that the Optio 33L can be purchased at an amazingly low price of around $200.  Most other 3 megapixel cameras with these type of features still sell for $300 to $400.  Let's take a closer look:

<b>Features</b>

While many people, myself included, tend to only use basic features and ignore the more complex features, I found myself experimenting and playing with all the features that come loaded onto the Pentax Optio 33L.  Why is this?  I think the main reason is because the menus were so easy to navigate that it was almost fun.

A few of my favorite features are as follows.  First of all, I love the digital filters that come preset with the camera.  These filters include Sepia, B&W, B&W Red, B&W Blue (our personal favorite), B&W Green, Blue, Red, and Green.  My wife always pays those over-priced photo studios major bucks to add filtering to their pictures.  Once my wife saw how great this camera took pictures using the digital filters, she vowed to never pay extra at those studios ever again.

A second feature I love is the preset camera settings that come built-in.  You can choose from portrait, flower, landscape, 3-D, panarama, night scene, or you can manually program your own settings using the sharpness, contrast and saturation settings.  The Optio 33L is one of the few cameras in this price range that gives you these manual controls.  We tend to use the portrait mode most, but I have had fun playing around with the panarama mode.

Another lesser known feature, but one of the main reasons we bought the camera, is the P.I.M II capability.  P.I.M stands for print image matching and what this means is that your printed photos will be enhanced using a P.I.M printer (nice marketing technique since Epson is the one selling these printers).  We bought the Epson Stylus Photo 825 and received a $75 rebate just because we bought a camera that was P.I.M enabled.  You can't beat getting a nice photo printer for $25.  So how do the P.I.M enhanced pictures come out?  Excellent.  The images are crisp, clear and vibrant and are identical to what you see when you take the picture.  We couldn't be happier.

Let me quickly run down some of the other nice features.  The camera has a 3x optical and 2.7x digital zoom for an impressive 8x combined zoom.  I like the position of the zoom button and it is easy to use.  Closeups come out sharp and clear.  It has a nice swivel LCD screen that allows you to take self-portrait or groups shot.  This is extremely handy when taking a group photo as everyone can see the countdown timer and knows when the picture will be taken.  You can create a 30 second movie (fun to play with but not very good quality) or see a slide show of your photos.  We usually use the included video cable to hook it up to the TV to watch the slide show.  Our kids get a kick out of it.  You can also protect your favorite photos and save your favorite camera settings.  I also like the fact that you only need two AA batteries to power the camera as opposed to the four AA batteries that most other cameras require.  Just make sure you use NIMH rechargeables, which are a wise investment with any digital camera purchase.  All-in-all this is one feature packed camera.

<b>Drawbacks</b>

I've heard many reviewers of this camera complain about the lack of a viewfinder.  I'll admit that it would be nice to have a viewfinder, but as I use the camera more and more it becomes less of an issue for me.  Once in a great while I have a hard time seeing the LCD screen in extremely bright sunlight, but once I attached the include LCD sunblocker (just a flimsy piece of black cardboard) I could see the LCD screen just fine.

Another drawback is the shutter lag, but I have to say that most cameras in this price range have some sort of shutter lag.  What is neat about this camera is that you can halfway depress the picture taking button to warm up the camera.  Once you see the red light you can press the button the rest of the way and the photo will be taken instantaneously.  It takes some practice, but I've gotten pretty good at it.

Finally, the camera tends to white-out the images in dark settings.  This is easily solved, however, if you learn to use the proper settings.

<b>Final Comments</b>

This is a great 3.34 megapixel camera that gives you plenty of bang for your buck.  Sure, there are nicer 3 megapixel cameras out there but you will pay considerably more for them.
