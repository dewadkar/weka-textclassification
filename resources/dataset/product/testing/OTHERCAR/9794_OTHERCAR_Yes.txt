            I purchased my 1995 del sol SI in June and since then it's been through some heavy modifications.  I started with a new paint job, etc.  Nowadays, it's one pretty sweet ride.  Due to Honda discontinuing the del sol in 1996, I purchased the car used from a reputable Honda dealership.  The sole intent of purchasing this car was merely to add it to my "lineup" of Honda's and of course, to trick it out something fierce.  As for tricking this car out, it has been relatively easy - like other Honda's, but sometimes I ran into a few problems trying to find just the right stuff for the car.  This lead me to have some disdain for the car, but in the end, it was well worth it.

This car was definitely manufactured for a range of drivers.  I am 21 and love driving the car as does my 40 year old mother - she refers to it as her mid-life crisis.  She mainly loves how easy it is to take the roof off of the vehicle and the easy carrier for the roof that is built right into the trunk.  After having owned a Jeep Wrangler, it was a must that this convertible top be easier to take off and put on than the Jeep's top.

Before the car was tricked out, it was a head turner.  So, it just goes to show that the car is pretty sweet when it's all stock too.

I would highly recommend this car to any person of any age.  The car offers something for everyone, comfort, die-hard Honda reliability, and great looks.  The seats are to die for - the most comfortable of any Honda - including their Acura lineup (I have a 2000 Integra GS-R with leather interior, and this little car is way more comfortable).  The trunk is also very spacious which is great for the much needed cargo room in the little car.

Overall, this is a fantastic car that is a lot of fun for anyone.  I suggest that you find yourself a del sol as soon as possible and take her for a test drive, you'll be hooked - trust me!
