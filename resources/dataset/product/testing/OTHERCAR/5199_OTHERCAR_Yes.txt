            When we decided to buy a new car in November of 98, we knew it had to be full size. This alone narrows the choice. We started out at the Ford dealer and tried the Crown Victoria. Then down the street to the Mercury dealer. Since we had allready driven the Crown Victoria we decided to over look the Grand Marquis and opted to test the Lincoln Town Car. After driving it I was ready to go elsewhere. The salesman said try the Grand Marquis before you leave. I reluctantly agreed and he brought out a Dark Green GS model for us to test drive. I instantly fell in love with the way the car handled. It was roomy, comfortable and rode like a dream. I couldn't believe that this was a cheaper car than the Lincoln. The sales man said &quot;Well most of it is identical to the Lincoln. We bought it that night. Highway mileage has been impressive, a nearly constant 27 mpg, and in town not bad 17-19 mpg. Now nearly two years old we have nearly 55 thousand miles on it, and not a rattle or problem of any kind. In early December we were rear ended on the interstate, Estimated impact was 30-40 mph by the highway patrol. Certainly some damage, but not nearly as much as on the Lexus SUV that hit us. Its been repaired, and still drives like a dream. Without a doubt the best car I have ever owned. With retirement coming up in three more years, I'll be ready for a new one in about two more years. This will be the first car I have ever bought a second of.<br><br>
