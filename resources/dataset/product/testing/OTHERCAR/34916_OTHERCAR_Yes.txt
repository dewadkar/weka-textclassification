            I purchased my 2000 Odyssey LX in April 2000. My wife had trepidations about driving the Odyssey. Compared to her beloved Civic hatchback, Honda's minivan is a behemoth. With time however, she got used to the Odyssey and is now quite comfortable behind the wheel.

Don't get me wrong, the Odyssey is one fine machine. I'd buy another one today. I like most everything about it, with a few exceptions. None of what I'm about to describe are "show stoppers" but Honda engineers should take note in the spirit of continuous improvement.

1.) The back of the third seat should have hooks to hang grocery bags. The Chrysler product has them...why not the Honda?

2.) The cup holders in the folding table do not work well, particularly with tall containers. Everyone is entitled to stow their extra tall, low-fat decaf cappuccino without fear of being scorched.

3.) The rubber seals on the sliding doors are too sticky. With manual doors, it's a struggle to pull the handle hard enough to overcome the seal. In fact, I once pulled too hard and broke one of the handles. The service department did not seem surprised over the situation, which strongly suggests that this defect is known to them. The handle was replaced and new seals were installed under warranty. Still, the problem persists. It seems to be worse when the door has not been opened for a few days. This problem had me lamenting that I didn't buy the EX with power sliders, but from what I've read about their performance on this Web site, perhaps I'm better off with the manual version after all.

4.) I was astonished to learn that my front brake pads had to be replaced and the disks resurface after only 15,000 miles. Yes, I use the Odyssey mostly for city runs, but only 15,000 miles on a set of pads? Please!

There. I feel better having expressed myself. I hope I haven't scared off any would-be Odyssey owners. That would be a shame, for it truly is a good vehicle and the class of the field. But like I stated at the outset, Even the Best Can be Better.
