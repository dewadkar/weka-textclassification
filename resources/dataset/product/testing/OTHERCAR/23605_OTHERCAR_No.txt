            A CAR YOU MIGHT WANT TO AVOID

My wife and I were very excited about this car when we first saw it. 
We loved the design, the power, the ride, and the cabinet room.
The fact that the car had good reviews, very low mileage for the year (37k), and one owner helped us make the decision real fast.
After we bought the car, the first problem was the fogy windshield, no matter how high you put the heater, the windows won't clear 100% but we learned to live with this issue.

Exactly two months after the purchase, the oxygen sensor goes bad while driving on the highway, and it caused a major power surge in the electrical system. I was very disappointed, but I said &quot; it happens &quot;.
We fixed the problem at the dealer $350.00, and did the regular maintenance.

Shortly after, we started smelling a very strong fuel odor, we took the car to the dealer again, only to find that the O-rings for the fuel line were  bad and needed to be replaced. We were very lucky that the car didn't catch on fire. The repair was done for about $450.00

Three months went by, and we started to hear a rattle from the passenger side, the car went to the dealer, and they replaced the upper control arm, and a balljoint, and at the same time the car was at the dealer we asked them to check the engine for a hesitation. We were told that we needed to change the spark plugs wires. The cost for this repair was $500.00

The car still had some hesitation at certain speed, but nothing like before.

Late in the summer the Air Conditioning stopped working, we visited our friends at the dealership again, and they advised us that the condenser, and the drier units were bad, and they need to be replaced. Luckily, the previous owner had the same problem, and it was still under warranty. The dealer kept the car for about five days. 

The car ran smooth for about 3 months, and the trouble started all over again, the car now has about 56k miles, the spark plug wires needed to be replaced again, tune-up, plus a coilpack, and a module, the trip to the dealer this time cost about $800.00

The car was fine after that repair until we noticed a problem in the trans. The trans was not shifting properly. The last visit to the dealer cost us $60.00, and a diagnosis that the car needs a transmission with an estimated cost of $2700.00. that's when my wife and I decided that we cannot keep the car any more.

We were able to trade the car for $3000.00, and we don't miss a thing about that car except the acceleration when you get on the highway.

Due to the poor experience that we had with this car, I strongly do not recommend this car to anyone, unless you have so much time, and money to spare.

I feel that The Dodge Product has a very nice design, lots of power, very practical features, but no reliability what so ever.
