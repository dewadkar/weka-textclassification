            My wife and I own a 1994 Toyota Corolla  LE that we bought new . It was the basic model with a stereo and no air bags . We cannot have air bags as my wife is 4ft.11in. I am 5ft. 10in . this was the last model to come without them. 

We had such good service and dependability with this car by keeping the warranty checks continued even past the expire date , that we decided to look for a new Toyota Corolla for 2001.

My wife started by checking e-pinions and setting her price range - (we have to convert to Canadian $). Also we found out about Toyota's " no deal " computer system. The e-pinions gave us a whole page of inside information that was like ammo for a solder -my wife the trader.  

First she checked all the dealers in the area - and all the dealers within a 45 minute drive  in all out lying towns.  I went in to get the no deal price and the estimate on the trade in price of our older Toyota. 

The price quoted was $19,240 and a trade in price of
 $6000.  (These prices are all Canadian $ ) I got a print out of this to take to show my wife.  While on a shopping trip to a small town south of the city she dropped into the local dealer and she did the same thing. The quoted price was $18,600 and she was offered $ 6800 on her trade . 

With these two figures she then went to the corporate earning reports for Toyota in the library and saw that the 2002 models were being produced with cost saving efficiencies for the company.

 We decided to delay the purchase until the 2002 model came out and was past the summer season. By October my wife had saved cash to make the deal, she had $13,000 and was determined to get the car -with options for that.

We went to the out lying dealer and test drove the 2002 Corolla , we had the car cleaned -polished and interior wiped clear of dust , this makes a big difference. When the evaluation came back we had the trade in quote of $6990, and the 2002 Toyota Corolla was listed for $18,900. without options . 

In Canada if air bags are to be deactivated an Air Bag De-activation  form has to be filled out and sent to Ottawa for approval. ( 1800-333-0371) the cost of the kit is added to the price of the car. 

 Also my wife wanted the CE value package that  consisted of Full Wheel Covers , Body Side Molding, Air Conditioner, Tilt Steering Wheel, Key Less Entry,Power Door Locks, and Splash Guards. 

 The Corolla CE 2002 comes with the fuel efficient and peppy 1.8 liter,twin cam 16 valve with variable valve timing and gets 37 Mpg in city and 52 Mpg on the highway . 

Standard features not in our older model include: Child Protected Door Locks, Anchor Points for Child Restraint Seats, Intermittent Wipers, Door Map Pockets, Front and Rear Cup Holders, Digital Clock , Full Fabric seats ( more comfortable too), Rear Seat Heater Ducts,  Rear  Seat Adjustable Headrests,60/40  Split Rear Seat. Driver Vanity Mirror and Cargo Interior Lamp. 

The increased standard features are reasons enough for us to move to the new model. But we are so impressed with the Corolla performance and handling that we are sure that this is our car for the next 10 years.

We will miss our old Corolla , we had  no problems with that wonderful car ,but as fickle humans we were introduced to the sexier new model and we took it . I am sure as a used car our 1994 will serve her second owner just as well. 

In the end my wife bought the car for $12,037.50$Canadian (US$7,631.77)
drive away price  - with the car delivered to her door with roadside exchange of keys . 
Again we want to thank this e-pinion site for giving us the bargaining power to save big time dollars. We will enjoy a much better Christmas this year because of it. 
Update:
Jan10 
        We have been driving our car and we can't get enough of it. The little touches that have changed the way you sit in the car and drive are just great.I love the little storage area on the left ahead of the steering column for the garage remote control= just flip down and touch then flip back. 
We are more than pleased with our Corolla-but I have to watch the pick-up. It can put you over the speed limit so fast  and smooth that it is easy to forget how fast you are going.
