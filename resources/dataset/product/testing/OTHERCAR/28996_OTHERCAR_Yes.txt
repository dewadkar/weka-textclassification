            It has been a little over two months since I bought my new 2000 Honda CR-V EX. The main reason for my purchase was due to the recent increase in gas prices and insurance price, because it was a four cylinder model. 

Engine:

The 2000 engine produces 146 HP. It has its fair share of setbacks, it makes a lot of noise above 3000 RPM which will get annoying from time to time. Acceleration is average, you can't expect too much from a four cylinder, but it does its job well.

Gas Mileage

The car gets 22 MPG in the city, and 25 MPG in the highway, well above many other SUV's out there, Don't get the feeling that you will never have to fill up the gas tank, because it is pretty small.

Interior:
The interior is very roomy, with four cup-holders for the front passengers, but they seem too large, not even a Super Size drink from Burger King is large enough to fit in any of the cup-holders. The seats are nice and comfy, but no power seats are available on the EX or LX. Also a nice feature is the standard CD player on the EX model trim, for those of you with CD burners, this car reads them with no problems, unlike the Grand Cherokee. However a few extra speakers would have been a nice welcome in this car, with only four speakers, the music significantly loses whatever life it had with the windows down. The dashboard is nice and neat, with the gauges easy to read. The low fuel indicator light seems to take a break much more than usual, it comes on, then shuts back off. I know that the movement of gas in the tank causes this, but it occurs much more than average compared to other cars, where the light comes on, and stays on until you refuel. A sunroof would also be welcomed as an option.

Body:
The car looks real nice, especially when equipped with the EX wheels. The outer body of the car could use an improvement, a few dents have been made on the side doors, because people hit my car with their doors from parking too closely. This has never happened on my Jeep Grand Cherokee, on the Jeep only the paint would chip off, but on the Honda, the paint stays, but a noticeable dent is made instead. It has a weak outer shell. I have also seen a number of CR-V's on the street that have an unaligned grill. This is also noticeable on mine as well, however this is only limited to some CR-V's, not all.

4WD system

The four wheel drive system provides power to the rear wheels when it detects slippage in the front wheels. I think it should be the other way around. The reason for this is that when you slow the car, for instance, when you approach a stop sign but you don't come to a complete stop, afterwards when you press the accelerator a little hard, shifting the weight of the car to the rear wheels, the four wheel drive system responds with a sudden jerk, it feels just as though somebody gave you a slight shove from behind. This happens when you go up a steep driveway like mine as well. 

Handling:

The handling on this car is average, there is a lot of body roll when going through curvy roads. You have to know, it is a utility vehicle, not a sports utility vehicle. The turning radius is much smaller than other SUV's, a great feature for making quick U-Turns without tire squeals.

Quality:

This is something that Honda is known for, I am sure that this car will last for quite some time. However, don't expect too many extra services from the dealers, after all, it's only a Honda, not a Mercedes-Benz. Managers will be a hassle to talk to. I don't think customer satisfaction means much to them after what I went through with my dealer, Rosenthal Honda.

Overall:

This is a great car, but you get what you pay for, I recommend this car to a lot of people, but it could use a few improvements. 

NOTE: This is just my opinion of the car, by no means do I acknowledge for you to be heavily persuaded by this. I encourage you to test drive this car and decide for yourself whether or not if this car is for you. After all, you are going to be the one driving the car after you buy it, not me. So your opinion matters the most, not mine.<br><br>
