            We got our 2001 model Passat wagon (GLX, 4motion, fully loaded) almost a year ago, and _every_ day we realize just how much we love our car. Internally, the fit and finish is remarkable--just pull down one of the grab handles above the windows, and watch it float back up into position, or feel the glove compartment thunk shut. (To be totally honest, though, the glove box is pretty much useless if you keep the 1.5 inch thick owner's manual inside.)

The 2.8 liter engine on the GLX (required for the 4motion model) really does a great job of moving the car around. It's the basline engine for Audi's A6, and it definitely lives up to those standards. Great pull off the line--you'll really notice a difference from a standstill if you compare the 2.8 to the baseline 1.8T, although we have friends with the 1.8T who are still really happy with their performance (and their better mileage).

The last key thing for us is the 4Motion AWD system. This has two real benefits:
1) Obviously, in bad weather, this makes an _enormous_ difference. I've driven straight up a snow-covered hill, while other cars were literally sliding backwards and sideways off the road.
2) Everyday handling. The 4Motion system is almost identical to the Quattro used in all Audis, and it makes a tremendous difference just getting around. The car dives through the middle of turns as if it were a much more expensive sport vehicle.

Finally, if you splurge on the loaded model, you get all the awesome little extras that make it great to live in the 21st century: rain-activated windshield wipers, whose rate is a function of rain intensity and road speed; power seats and mirrors that are set to individual remote keys, and swing into position for you as soon as you open the door; a 200-watt stereo system (with subwoofer); and on and on...

Overall, this is really a tremendous car, and even fully loaded, at least $10K than the respective AWD models from Volvo and Audi. We really can't speak highly enough of it.
