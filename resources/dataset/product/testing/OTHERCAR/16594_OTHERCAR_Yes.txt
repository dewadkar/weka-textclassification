            This is my first digital camera (though I've used ones borrowed from co-workers).  I'm generally very happy with this camera, and recommend it and other, newer Cybershot cameras to friends.

As the other reviews have pointed out, the cost of "must-have" accessories are a big down side to this camera, though I would point out that the memory stick issue seems to be common among many, many cameras.  I've found that the small included stick is comparable to the other 2 megapixel cameras out there, regardless of the type of media they use.  My bigger issue is with the battery and case.  Basically, if you buy this, plan on getting the accessory case.  It really is essential.

I'm very happy with the picture quality.  You can see many of my shots on my web site (check my profile).  Click on the "gallery" link on the left.  Any pictures taken since September 2001 was most likely taken with the P50 or is clearly marked as coming from my SLR.

I have the 128 MB stick and rarely run out of room.  I think I ran out once on my vacation to China, and once because I was just lazy deleting pictures (I take a lot of shots with it.

My two biggest concerns with this camera are the "slowness" of the camera (cycle time between shots and focus time) and the night shots.   The camera seems to take a long time to charge up the flash, which has prompted me to turn the flash off unless I need it.  This is annoying.  My second problem is with action shots... I've had trouble doing a focus-lock type of action with it (where you press down the shutter partway to lock focus then depress fully to take the picture).  It's more touchy than I expected and took some time to get used to.  With impromptu situations, the camera just takes too long to focus and shoot.

At night, I've had a lot of problems with getting correct exposure on night shots (outdoors, mostly).  I think part of this is that I'm used to the flexibility of a good SLR, and am not yet comfortable with what's essentially a compact camera.  Maybe.  I'm not sure why this is (I'm still experimenting when I get a chance to shoot at night).  I'm beginning to think that this is either a deficiency in the camera or digital cameras in general.  Anyway, just be aware that you may have problems with shooting at night outdoors.

Indoors, the flash either seems too bright or not bright enough some of the time.  It's not too big a deal (most of the time, the shots come out fine indoors).  Just something else to be aware of.

In the balance, though, I'm very happy with this camera.  It works well, has put up with a good deal of abuse (it's in a messenger bag or backpack filled with stuff for work, laptops, books, printouts, etc.) and has survived well so far.

If you're looking for a good, simple to use camera, the P50 is for you.  It's great for web sites and smaller prints, and is very handy as a "always carry" type of camera.  The zoom and other features easily put it at the top of its class.  

I'm used to my Minolta xtsi SLR, so I'm not 100% satisfied with the P50 as a camera (I still use the film-based SLR for once in a lifetime vacations and events).  As a digital camera, this is one of the best in it's price/feature range.
