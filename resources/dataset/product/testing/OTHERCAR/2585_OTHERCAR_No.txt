            In 1995 I saw the new Eagle Vision TSI on my local Chrysler dealer's showroom floor, and had to have it. Boy did I get it! After 8 weeks of ownership I drove the vehicle a total of 2 weeks, the service dept. had the pleasure of keeping it the rest of the time. Fortunately, our state has lemon laws, and after I began filing the necessary papers Chrysler agreed to re-purchase the vehicle...if I bought another Chrysler. Ok, I'm not unreasonable, and they were trying, so I agreed to accept a Plymouth Grand Voyager. It had every available option, and I was really pleased until after about 17,000 miles. My family and I were on an outing to a football game, some 200 miles from home, when the transmission clunked, and stopped pulling. Even though Chrysler replaced the transmission, the new one made the same noises I had noticed in my first one. After speaking to several of my friends who had owned Dodge Caravans, or Chrysler Town and Country vans, I was astounded to find that they had all replaced transmissions in their vans. Two of their vans were on their third transmission. A little late, I began to research in Consumer Reports and other consumer magazines, and found the reviews of known problems with transmissions, in all Chrysler vehicles. As recently as last year I asked a friend who had recently purchased a new Chrysler minivan, how his experience had been with his new van. Regretfully, he had the same experience as me. Apparently the transmission problems are still being manufactured, and families are still sitting on the roadside awaiting the tow truck.<br><br>
