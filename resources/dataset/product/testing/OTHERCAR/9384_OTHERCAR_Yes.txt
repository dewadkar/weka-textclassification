            Being a lifelong fan of Volkswagons, when my commute to work became 38 miles one way, my husband and I decided that I needed something more reliable and more comfortable than my 1987 VW Golf. We went to the VW dealership and test drove a few of the newly used models. I immediately fell in love with the Jetta GLX. 

The interior is very roomy and the dashboard lights are something out of this world. My husband is 6 feet tall and is able to get comfortable in this car due to the steering wheel having tilt and telescopic features and the adjustment features of the seats. 

The other safety features of this car are daytime running lights, ABS, dual airbags, side airbags, and automatic locks. The car automatically locks the doors when you reach a certain speed which I feel is important in this day and age of car-jacking instances. I feel very secure and safe driving my car.

The only problem I have had with this car is that the back floor was flooding with water on the passenger side. This happened while the car was still under warranty so my husband and I dropped it off after explaining to the dealership what was happening. They belittled me by saying that I must have left the window down or maybe the door wasn't shut properly when it rained. To make a long story short, I had to take it to them 4 times before they found and fixed the problem. It seems the hose from the air conditioner wasn't long to go through the firewall to drain outside, so all the water was flooding the floor inside the car instead. It was a real nuisance not having my car and even though the service manager was polite, I feel that they should have found this problem sooner. 

This is a problem with the VW dealership, not the car itself so I would definitely recommend this car to a friend.<br><br>
