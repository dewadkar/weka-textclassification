            I recently bought a 1990 Acclaim with a little under 100,000 miles on it.  I traded in the Acclaim's predasessor, a 1987 Plymouth Reliant.  My little K car was running on her last leg, and I had to let her go.  In the used car lot, I saw this sad looking little rusted up Acclaim, and asked to take it for a spin.  I fired her up and took her out on the highway.  She jumped into high gear, and drove along at 85 as smoothly as if she was going about 40 mph.  

Aesthetically, she needed some work, but for $1,100.00 ($850.00 with trade), I couldn't pass her up.  Fortunately, the rust spots were only surface rust, and thanks to a coupon for Earl Scheib, she is now rust free and has a great new paint job.  

My Acclaim is the LE Edition.  It came with special wheel covers, chrome pieces around the wheels and bottom of the sides, a lumbar-support driver's seat, a computer panel showing any problems with the car, and several gauges.  The rear seats fold down in the backseat to make even more room in the huge trunk.

Standard on the Acclaim are an AM/FM radio (mine also has cassette) and four speakers in the doors on the car.  It has a 4 cylinder 2.5L engine with automatic transmission.

I LOVE my Acclaim, it runs wonderfully, is so comfortable and roomy, and was so incredibly cheap, how could I have gone wrong?
