            This is a good solid camera. I bought it 6 months ago (early in its product cycle) and had only one firmware upgrade via the internet. It is perfect for the high end amateur, however it lacks some features like f-stop, aperture control. 
Batteries drain fast, as mentioned in many other reviews and I recommend a card reader instead of a power supply to save the batteries.
The camera is simple to use and you will get good pictures even if you hand it to a tourist while standing in front of a waterfall in Yosemite park. 
If you use this camera in conjunction with a digital print service, nobody will be able to tell the difference to 35mm.
