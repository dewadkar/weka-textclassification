            Honda has got to be my favorite auto manufacturer.  I have been in love with the Honda Civic for years and years to come.  This car has got to be one of the nicest looking, fuel efficient, performance driven cars for the price it's offered for.  With the dependability of Honda, this car will last you for a lifetime.  The Honda Civic is a very popular car.  Almost everywhere I look, I see a Honda Civic.  I have been such a huge fan of this car, and the Honda company itself.  They make such great cars and offer at such a great price.  The Civic has a lot of power behind it also depending on what class you get it in.  The fastest Civic you can buy is the Type-R, but, those are mainly used for just racing and I think are only available in Japan right now.  The class right below that, is the SI, which is probably the most popular and desired to most drivers who know their Honda's.  Civic SI's are sold at Honda dealers for a price a little bit more than a standard Civic.  There are other different classes for the Civic that can be found at any Honda dealership.

This is such a great car and is a great purchase for the price and makes a perfect first car for any teenager.  Honda has been a well respected car manufacturer for decades and I will always love the cars that they produce.<br><br>
