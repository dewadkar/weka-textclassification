            After looking at digital cameras, I was about to lose my mind. Then I checked out the Kodak DC-215. The ease of taking pictures and the quality of the photos exceeds other cameras in it's price range.
    There are so many digital cameras on the market today, it is easy to become overwhelmed by all the technical information. All I wanted was a camera that I could take quality photos with and not have to study a manual for weeks. The DC215 really comes through with a simple, and well designed easy to use camera. 
     I have an iMac computer and the cables included with the camera do not support USB, so I opted to buy a card reader. That was the only surprise after I bought the camera. The cables included are definitely geared for PC, and adapters are almost as costly as the card reader.
     If you are looking for a camera that has excellent resolution, is very easy to use, and won't break your bank, you should take a close look at this camera.<br><br>
