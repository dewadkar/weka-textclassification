            I have to say, when I came across an opinion on this car, I had to write my own!
This was my dream car for so long, and 4 years ago, I finally got one.  It was the exact color red with a black top), and all the options I said I wanted.  I bought it a few years used, and got a great price.
This car was so much fun, and I had a blast while I owned it. It is such a sharp looking car in my opinion, and if I ever can afford another, I will go for it (as a second car).
It was great even in the snow.

I had no major problems with it at all, and what did go wrong was an easy fix.  The parts to the German cars are a little more expensive, but I found that they have to be fixed less often than other cars I have owned.

This car made me feel so &quot;in&quot;, so cool.  I know, its silly, but in the summer, cruising with the top down, radio blasting, on my way to the beach... (or to the grocery store, LOL) made me feel like I was in high school again.

Anyway, then reality set in; I was a wife, who now had to shop for a &quot;family&quot; car.  So, I traded my hip, happening, far out ride for.................a Dodge Caravan, yes a Mini Van! The vehicle that has &quot;Definitely not a hip, happening teenager&quot; written all over it!

I recommend this Cabriolet to anyone who wants to feel the thrill of being young and carefree, even if you have a Mini Van parked in your garage!
