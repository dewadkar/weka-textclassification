            My wife and I were looking for an inexpensive, passenger safe, all conditions car. Our Subaru Legacy is great for the job. We can feel safe when our 3 year old son is in the back seat, and we can also bring it off road when we need to do a little bit of work. 

   The Legacy has a great inside. The seats are comfortable and both of the front seats come with amazing seat warmers. A sun roof is available, which is a great feature to have in any car. Also the trunk is huge I can fit almost anything in it. It also looks great, the flashy new look will catch anyones eye. 

The Subaru Legacy has a V6 engine and has great great handling. It comes with AWD which is handy all the time like snow. I have never driven in the snow with so much ease. The AWD is fabulous and so is the handling. 

There is nothing bad about the Legacy. It is probably the most ideal car for the average family in America. Inexpensive, safe, can be used for any conditions,large trunk, great interior, great extirior look, great engine, AWD, and great handling. what more could you want for a car under 15,000$         <br><br>
