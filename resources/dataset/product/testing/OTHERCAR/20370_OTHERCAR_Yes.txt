            I went looking for an affordable SUV this summer. I fell in love with the Nissan Xterra. I took the Xterra out for a test drive (I never drove an SUV before) and was mortified with the ride - no power and the handling was awful. The salesman assured me that this was how an SUV drove. I then took two more test drives over the next few months to convince myself that I should get this SUV.I also test drove the Pathfinder and Honda CR-V. On a whim, I went over to a Mazda dealership to test drive the new Tribute. I liked the sophisticated look of it and figured what the heck. The drive was incredible. I put cars/SUV's through a pretty demanding test drive here in New York. Merging onto the Grand Central Parkway and LIE is a harrowing experience if your vehicle is underpowered. The Tribute's 6 cylinder engine handled the merges easily. The drivers view of the road is clear and unobstructed, the engine is powerful and the cabin is comfortable and quiet. New York drivers (hate to stereotype,but...) are known for their aggressive and sometimes unpredictable driving habits and the Tribute handled everything my fellow Noo Yawkers could throw at it. I felt the ride to be solid, safe and comfortable. I bought the car moments after we returned to the showroom. Here are the pro's and con's as I see them:

Cool:
- Quick and powerful engine
- Love the high seating position and wide open views
- Incredible Multi disc CD player that loads directly into unit
- Handles in a very car like manner
- Tremendous storage space - even without the rear seats folded down
- Rear seats are easy to fold down (and I am a spaz with such things)
- Decent gas mileage (20-21 est)
- Pleny of internal storage pockets/cup holders. The main storage compartment/armrest is huge (You can put a canned ham in there along with your CD's and tapes
- Mazda people have been incredibly professional and decent to deal with
- Price point and price/value relationship is strong
- It really is a good looking SUV (shallow perhaps, but a definite plus)

Drag:
- The ignition key slot is not lighted
- I would like to see a larger capacity gas tank
- What's with the 1960's type antenna that doesn't retract?
- The drivers side door armrest is sooo narrow
- The internal door handles are kinda cheap 'n cheesy
- My wife keeps taking it
- And yea, the gear shifter is way too long...

All in all the negatives are more of the minor irritant variety that do 
not distarct from the overall value/quality/performance of this vehicle. Yes, you can spend much more money on another SUV but this is one solid bargain that is hard to beat.
