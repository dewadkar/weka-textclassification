            A great investment for me was the SLK230 kompressor.  From mercedes for about 42,000 it wasnt a bad deal at all.  Its a 2.3 liter two seater roadster with a 4 in-line 16valve engine with a intercooled supercharger and 185 horses.  

The top is great.  There are no latches or anything just folds in nicely.  And the best part is it is a hardtop.  

At a price such as this the only problem is whether or not to go with this or the Porsche boxster.  I personally love this car.  Its got enough power to get me around after all I live in the city.  Its pleasant and reliable.  If you want something just for the sporty look then go with the Boxster.<br><br>
