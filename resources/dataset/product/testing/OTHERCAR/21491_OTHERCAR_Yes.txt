            We just bought a 97 Grand Prix, and we love it!!! It is roomy, fast, and comfortable. Those are things I most love about this vehicle. My husband loves it because it looks sleek and stylish. He also likes the speed and handling. There really isn't anything we hate about this vehicle, except that it has huge doors and sometimes in tight parking spaces they take up too much room.

To drive this vehicle is exquisite! It's handling is great and there is really nothing wrong with the way it drives. Although, sometimes there seems to be something wrong with the people driving it (maybe they need to go back to drivers ed or something). So I would recommend this to everyone even my family!<br><br>
