            I needed a camera that could take good photos, but I wanted to be able to put them on my computer and email to them to friends if I needed. I wanted to get a nice camera but nothing too &amp;#65279;extravagant. So this Nikon was a perfect choice. With a easy view screen on the back to view every picture you take, this camera tops the cameras in its price range (i got it for 500$). I have used this product at parties, to capture all the great moments, and family events that I could cherish forever. Take on vacations and store up to 36 pictures per memory card. What I love most about this product is all of its features. Its easy view screen on back that allows you to edit any pictures you dont want, quality settings of Fine, Normal, and Basic. These settings determine how much information gets into each picture. A neat feature is you can set it to a &quot;semi-automatic&quot; mode in which you can keep pressing the button and take up to 10 consecutive pictures. I find that feature amazing. You also have a choice for flash. This great Nikon product I have found to be very durable for I have had no mechanical problems yet, and its features are very easy to use. Some things you may dislike about this product is that you have to hold down the picture button for a few seconds before it takes the picture (except in semi-auto mode) and you may not like its price. It also eats up &amp;#65279;battery power fairly quickly. But no film cost easily makes up for the  batteries it uses. I personally recommend this product if you desire digital capabilities and 500 dollars is what you are willing to spend.<br><br>
