            A few years ago, I decided to buy myself a Neon.It was a 95 model, one yr old at the time.Has some good points to it, but the repairs, oh the repairs!
At the time it seemed the right thing to do.Now that I have a friend who is a mechanic, it certainly helps because this car would be draining my poor pocketbook otherwise.Thank God I can get some decent deals from him!
Here are the things I love about my 'Nellie': peppy, good gas mileage, hugs those curves very well, pretty good accessible things on the dash;ie.don't have to reach a mile to change the radio station, etc.,&amp; the console....love that console,decent trunk space.
The bad: the unlit ashtray ( a bummer at night), &amp; too many repairs! Since I have bought it, I have had the brakes repaired twice, had to get a whole new exhaust system, a new catalytic converter, a new muffler, new tires (all 4) twice, &amp; new ignition, battery twice, &amp; the bugger still stalls, &amp; the brakes squeak terribly when car is first started. It is totally embarrasing!
All together I think I have put about $5000. into this thing, yet still have a few more car payments to make on it.
I think you get a lot more for your money when you spend a little more. I cheaped out in the initial buying of the car, but am losing out in the end.
Perhaps I just got stuck with a bad deal. Perhaps a new model would have been a better way to go.
I learned from my mechanic friend that these cars have a bad repair history.Hope other people have had better luck here than I.<br><br>
