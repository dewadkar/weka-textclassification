            It's fairly well known that high school and college student will fall in love with pretty much any hunk of junk that is gas powered and rolls.  Well I was spoiled; I can no longer fall in love with any car other than the Subaru Legacy L Wagon.  Okay, maybe I could, but not without spending considerably more money than the L costs, and I have.

My baby kicked around between my parents for five years before I got her, and then I drove her like hell for another four years when, sadly, she was sold.  This magnificent car which, purchased used, served my family for 9 years and was still able to fetch an excellent price, is the machine that I fell in love with.

Oh I drove many cars in the time that I owned that Subaru L.  I destroyed a lot of tires and brake systems on the back roads of Vermont so I spent a lot of time in other cars, including a Jeep Cherokee, and I still love my Subaru.  

That car never let me down.  Even with a break line shot I was able to drive down a mountain and to a garage.  On flat tires the car handled very well and never cause me any trouble.  As a matter of fact that car never caused a single accident.  Oh, I did damage to the car, but driving fast on back roads that car was beautiful.  It handled like a dream, dealt with snow, ice, sand and all without breaking stride.

When school was closed I always managed to make it down the mountain, and I always made it back home.  I was never stranded with my Subaru, the engine was trashed from being taken off road, but it still handled like a charm.  The Jeep was a nice car, but it wasn't my Subaru, too big for one.  The Pontiac just doesn't have the four wheel capabilities, that I needed.  The Aerostar, well, nope.  The Talon is a dream of a car, but it's too darn small, and expensive as heck too.  All in all my Subaru L Wagon is the best car I have ever driven.<br><br>
