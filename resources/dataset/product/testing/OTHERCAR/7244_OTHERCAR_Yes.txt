            In April 1999 I bought the new 99 Mercury Cougar V6.  I was so impressed with the car I decided to spend the extra money and special order one from the factory so it was fit to my order.  From the first time I sat in the Cougar, I was eager to take it home, so the six week wait (which turned into eight weeks) was a major disappointment, but it made my new car all that more fun.
  The car is awesome except the only thing I do not like about it is the fact that the cruise control is not lit on the steering wheel, which is a pain in night driving.  Also, I would also like to see the radio controls on the steering wheel.  <br><br>
