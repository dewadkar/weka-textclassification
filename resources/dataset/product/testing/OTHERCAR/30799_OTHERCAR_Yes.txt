            For years I have wanted a digital camera.  Like most consumers, I was hesitant because I felt the quality of the pictures were just not worth it.  A year ago I would have said to just go for a 35 MM camera and buy a scanner; now however, my views have changed.

Cameras are getting better with megapixel technology and higher resolutions.  Battery life, focus and even the features are becoming more comparable to film-loaded cameras.  Even if you would only use this camera for family pictures to load into a photo album its worth it.  The camera comes with easy to use instructions and Adobe Photo Deluxe 3 for picture enhancements.

The camera is preinstalled with a 16 MB memory card (new shipments of the camera), easy to use software, and a handy strap.  The resolution is 1260X960 which produces a fine colorful picture.  The LCD screen is great for scrolling through and reviewing pictures but if that doesn't satisfy you it even has a cable that can hook to a standard RCA jack on your TV or VCR to review pictures quickly and amaze family and friends.  The price is not bad either!  I bought my camera at Target for only $299 including 16 MB of memory!  It saves money over film and development and you become much less conservative about your picture taking so you have more photos to enjoy!

The Olympus 340-R has 4 settings.  

1. Super high quality + which gives you 2 pictures at excellent quality.

2. Super high quality which gives you 18 pictures at high quality.

3. High quality which also amazes me at the clarity with a total of 36 pictures.

4. Standard, which can take more than 120 pictures at great quality!

I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone looking for a easy to use and inexpensive camera.
