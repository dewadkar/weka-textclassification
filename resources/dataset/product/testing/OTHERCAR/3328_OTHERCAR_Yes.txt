            Oldsmobile's attempt at attracting younger buyers is a hit.  The Bravada is well designed and very safe.  One of the main reasons I bought it was because it comes with the Smartrack system which increases traction in poor driving conditions.  Where I come from there is a lot of snow, so this feature comes in very handy.  I tried to purposely cause the vehicle to skid to test the system and it would not slide at all.
The Bravada handles like a car.  It has great pickup too.  In addition, the Bravada has many features which make stand out.  There is plenty of leg room in the front, it comes in leather seats, it has a digital compass/thermometer, and it also comes with a device which you can program to open your garage door.  One drawback is that there is little leg room in the back seat.<br><br>
