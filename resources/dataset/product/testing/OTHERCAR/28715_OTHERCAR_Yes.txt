            I am a high mileage driver (40,000 annually) and needed a car which would boast of exceptional miles per gallon as well as a car that wouldn't break down on me in the midst of a busy Los Angeles commute. I found that in the Toyota Echo.

Traditionally I am a Honda owner. In fact I wrote a review on my '92 Honda Civic Sedan back in 2000.  What a super car. This year, however, my Honda was 10 years old, and the mileage -- over 400,000 virtually trouble-free miles.  Why, you might wonder, with a track record like that would I ever switch from a Honda Civic to a Toyota Echo.  Three very big reasons -- the new Civic is less powerful, the Civic costs several thousand dollars more, and the Toyota has comparable repair/maintenance records to the Civic.

Way back in '91 I test drove a gutless, woefully underpowered Toyota Tercel, and compared to the Civic, well, there was no real comparison - and the Honda won out easily.  But last month, when I test drove the Echo, I was absolutely blown away with the its acceleration and maneuverability - and this with the air conditioner blasting away.  The Honda is now a heavier car, so that was certainly unimpressive, and the styling -- virtually unchanged, which means it is a bit dated.  I was less then impressed with the 2002 Honda Civic HX when compared to the Echo.

The Echo sports a "center mounted" gauge console, which can take just a few moments to get used to.  But I no longer have to switch my view to see the gauges which used to be blocked by the steering wheel of the Honda.  With only a 1.5 liter engine, my peppy little Echo compares nicely to my old Honda.  The Echo is a quiet little car too.  It rides higher than the Civic, so I no longer feel as if I'm driving a tiny little roadster either. Mine is equipped with air conditioning, the AM/FM/Tape/CD console, manual stick shift (of course) and a rear window defogger.  I should also add that I ended up with the 4 door model, but not by choice on that issue. 

So far my miles/gallon have averaged 43.8 on the Echo, so I am quite pleased in that category. The Echo does not come with a tachometer, which took some getting used to.  It also does not come with a coolant temperature gauge -- so it's back to idiot lights for me.  On the other hand, the air circulates better, and the air conditioner does not bog down the drive as it did in my old Honda. 

I did quite a lot of "shopping" on the internet to compare those two vehicles, and even considered an internet purchase at one point (but that's another story.) By the time I was finished reading the various reviews and had gone through a few test drives, I was pretty sold on the Echo versus either the Corolla or the Civic.

The biggest "pain" for me was with the way Toyota options (equips) their cars.  The Toyota Echo is advertised dirt cheap.  Unfortunately, you can't find one that way.  I suppose a few are placed at the dealerships for marketing purposes, but I found it difficult to locate a car that wasn't already equipped with what Toyota figures are basic requirements for people.  In a way, they were correct, because I did in fact want air conditioning and a rear defogger (both of which are options).  But I also wanted the fold down rear seats, but I couldn't care less about a radio.  It turns out that the two door model does not come with fold down rear seats, isn't regularly equipped with the rear window defogger, no mirror adjustment devices, etc.  In other words, the two door model is sold as a stripped down model, and if you want something slightly more, you're forced to consider the 4 door model.  So I went with the 4 door model.  I had already been driving the 4 door Honda Sedan, so it wasn't a killer choice for me. Just be aware of the options game.  In the end, I got a car equipped with a higher grade of radio, a cute (but rather stupid) spoiler on the rear trunk just so that I could get the options that I really wanted.  Isn't that the game???

It is early in the life expectancy of my little car, with only a paltry 3,000 miles on the odometer. I think this vehicle is a good choice for people who want a high mileage car, peppy enough to scoot around in, yet still a little fun to drive.
