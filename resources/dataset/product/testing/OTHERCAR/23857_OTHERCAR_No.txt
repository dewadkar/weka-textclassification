            The reason I purchased this vehicle was because my last car was in bad shape and I was in need of a vehicle.  I wasn't sure what I wanted to buy until I saw a Dodge Caravan.  This vehicle when purchased ran good, but now that it has 150,000 miles on it, it smokes blue smoke when the engine starts getting warm, and I have noticed that about this particular model.  The transmission has also had to be replaced at around 70,000 miles.  But besides that it runs great.  When there is a full load in the van you can really tell, the engine will struggle a little.  I think the ride and comfort is great, I have gone on many trips and enjoy sitting in the seats for long periods of time.  I don't think that I would recommend this vehicle to a lot of people, just because of all the work I've had to do, and the engine smoking.  It's been very reliable and never breaks down, but since the two major things(transmission, and engine)had/have problems it's not the best van to own.<br><br>
