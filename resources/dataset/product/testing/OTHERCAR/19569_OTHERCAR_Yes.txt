            When our son was born, my wife and I decided hat we needed a family vehicle. Unfortunately for my wife, I am not the mini-van kinda guy and we decided on a Ford Explorer. Now I know this is a review for a Chevy Suburban, so please read on. I was surprised to learn that we outgrew that vehicle by the time our second child was two. We needed something a little bigger and so we went to the the top.

I am completely satisfied with the quality of the vehicle. It doesn't squeak or rattle and the interior finish and trim is very solid. Upon driving this SUV for the first time I was expecting a boxy truck-like ride. Well, it's not. The ride is similar to that of a full size sedan, although I'd think twice about hard cornering. It's sure footed and I've never felt that it was going to roll over, but I'm also not one to push the envelope.  The gauges are well positioned and there is terrific visibility from all the windows. One minor complaint is that the control for the power mirrors requires a reach. 

The room is amazing. There is enough room for 8 full size adults and luggage. Take out the rear seat and fold down the middle seat and you have a 8' foot bed to do some real hauling. Speaking of hauling, the towing capacity is terrific and if towing is a priority, one can match engines and axle ratios to tow up to 10,000 lbs. All this hauling and towing either people or things does come at a cost. Just normal driving I get between 13 and 14 MPG. Not too bad for the size of this SUV. It's insane to look at this SUV and expect 20 MPG, so if you're looking for a real people or product mover, this should be one of your top choices.

One thing that is always a real concern is reliability. When I sold our Ford, which was well built, reliable and at 80K miles had not a squeak or rattle, I was really afraid that our next vehicle would not have the same luck. Well, so far so good. The only reason my Chevy sees the dealer is to get the oil changed and routine maintenance, although  the first major service is at 100K miles.
