            -1998 Mazda 626 LX, 5 Spd, ABS-
Looking around the roads of today, we quickly come to realize some of the most popular cars in one of the most competitive automotive sectors:  the family/mid-size sedan class.  While Honda and Toyota lead in sales as well as reliability, Ford is not too far behind with its Taurus.  Other drives such as Mazda's 626, Mitsubishi's Galant, and Subaru's Legacy have far fewer market shares, along with the other assorted American brands. 

Mazda's 626 is an interesting car.  It was a bit too small from 1993-1997, and in 1998 it was redesigned with a larger, more contemporary body.  While it breaks no styling barriers, it is definitely a elegant automobile.  The front and rear fascias have very nice features, and the prominent chrome grille gives the car an upscale look.  My girlfriend and I leased a Freeport Green 1998 626 LX in June 1998 (of course!), and it has definitely been a purchase we don't regret.  We searched far and wide in Southern California to find a 626 with a manual and ABS.  We were both moving to New England and needed a car with ABS to handle winters here, and we were both big fans of manuals.  We had tested Accords, Subaru Legacies, and Camrys, but coupled with the discount that was available on the 626 and the fact that we would not have to see ourselves come and go on the road as owners of Accords do, we decided to go with the 626.

On the road, the 2.0 Liter 4-cylinder does an adequate job of motivating the car.  It is eager to rev, and sounds happy doing so.  It does not sound over stained but a bit more torque would be welcome when tackling hills.  The V6 is definitely a sweet sounding engine, but its price tag was prohibitive at that time, but looking back we should have bit the bullet and splurged there.  The shifter is very smooth and accurate, but the throws are somewhat long, discouraging very quick shifting.  The clutch has annoyingly deep travel, and it took a while to judge its engagement point.  The brakes are reasonably strong, but we both would prefer disc brakes(they are drums with the 4 cyl, discs with the V6)in the rear as well, as this would probably help inspire more confidence. The suspension is way too loose as it stands, and the 14 inch wheels coupled with smallish tires (185/70R14) combine provide wallowy handling.  The steering remains very responsive and provides good feedback.  I quelled some of the cornering concerns by swapping the standard 14inch wheel/tire combination for a 16 inch wheel/tire combination from a mail order chain.  This improved handling beyond all expectations, so I would suggest not to opt for the Mazda alloy wheels which will provide a marginal improvement in the handling.  The new wheel/tire combo cost us a reasonable $550.  

The interior of this car is very roomy and well designed.  The two-tone treatment of the interior is very pleasing to the eye, further bolstering the upscale look.  The seats are quite comfortable for long rides, but lack some support on the sides.  There is ample leg, head, and shoulder room for four, a bit tighter for five, but overall, the new model's larger size has translated very well to the interior space of the 1998 626.  The controls are quite logically placed, and the swing feature of the ventilation system is unique and extremely useful.  The cupholders are in a good position away from vents and the radio.  Speaking of which, Mazda's factory CD system should be satisfactory for 99% of all people, but aftermarket changes are easily done as well.  Trunk space is quite plentiful.

The ownership of the car has been an excellent experience, and it is largely so because of its driving qualities and its reliability.  We have not made one visit to the dealer yet other than for scheduled maintenance, and the car has been completely bullet-proof (knock on wood).  

In summary, the 626's are great values, especially with Mazda's seemingly perpetually good rebates, and the combination of a great product (that's a bit more unique than an Accord or a Camry) along with a reliability which approaches that of the big wigs and great incentives make the 626 a must-see.  Test drive the LX-V6 for a great bargain multi-valve V6 with the sweetest exhaust note this side of a sports car, with even more content than our lowly LX.  The 1999 ES is a dressed up LX without any other performance changes.  The ES-V6 has all options, but its price approaches that of Maximas.  The LX-V6 is the bargain here, but a bargain that may be difficult to find, especially with the slick manual.  With the V6 and a good set of tires, this car can become a definitely willing partner to your desire for a fun drive.  Hey, even the lowly 4 cylinder is not that bad a choice, unless you're used to bigger displacement cars.  With Mazda's resurgent quality and reliability, Honda and Toyota definitely have something to worry about.  Buy the 626 now so that people will at least take a look.  With a Camry or an Accord, they're so commonplace that even a new model doesn't draw any looks.  The 626 is definitely a driver's car, whose talents are just waiting to be displayed.  <br><br>
