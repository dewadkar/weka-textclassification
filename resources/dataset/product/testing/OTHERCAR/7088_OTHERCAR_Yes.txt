            I bought my beautiful little Corsica a few years ago for a mere 2,000 from a car lot who didn't think it worth their time to clean up and sell for more.  The car had 115,000 miles on it and ran like a dream.  This V6 multi-port FI engine really flies and more than one person driving my car was surprised by its quickness.  In the three years that I have had this vehicle I have put over 40,000 miles on it, mostly by making long trips to Ohio, Pittsburgh and NH from NJ.  This car has never been in the shop, the only repairs it has needed have been routine maintenance things like brakes and tires and the only time it ever stranded me was when my battery went dead.

Even though this car is ten years old and is a four door sedan,it has the feel of a sports car when you drive it, due to the speed and responsiveness.  The car still looks sharp after all these years and the only thing I can complain about is the paint on the front end is starting to deteriorate, however, I haven't waxed the car since I got it and it is kept outside.

As a single mother of three, safety and reliability are key factors and this car has proved itself to be one of the best I have ever owned, new or used.  If you want to get where you need to go and have a car with extremely low maintenance, the Corsica is the way to go!<br><br>
