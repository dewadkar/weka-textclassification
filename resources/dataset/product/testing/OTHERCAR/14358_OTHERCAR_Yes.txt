            Recently I sold an 1998 Ford Expedition XLT, it was a great Vehicle but
I did not need a big SUV nor the car payment that went along with it. 
Through a lot of internet research (my wife did that) we settled on a
2000 Altima SE. I was impressed with the overall design of the car and
after test driving it, we decided to get it over a Mitsubishi Galant.

The car we got had everything on it we wanted, leather, moonroof, CD.
The color is Titaninum Frost and it is pretty. IT handles very well in
traffic and excelerated when you need it. It came with Firestone Tires
but the dealership switched them out for GoodYear Eagles.

The reason I opted for the Altima as pricing, style, and comfort and
resale value.  There are some drawbacks  but I knew that switching
from an Expedition but so far the differences have been minimal.

The dealership I bought from was very knowledgeable about the car
and I was very impressed with the personal service given to me and 
my wife.

This is a very affordable car and would excellent for small families 
or a young married couple.<br><br>
