            When I ride this car, I ride in the backseat.
The 2000 accord is very roomy in the back, there�s more than enough room for three well-fit people.  I�ve ridden in the back for over three hours with my mother and sister, and didn�t get claustrophobic or experience fatigue.  The seat belts do not slide into the wrong places, they stay right on the shoulder.  The speakers don�t blare right into my ears like in other cars of this class.  The air conditioner gets to the back easily.  
My aunt has a 1998 Accord, the main difference is that the 1998 closes in toward the back, while the 2000 seems to get wider.  The 2000 is a much better experience.
