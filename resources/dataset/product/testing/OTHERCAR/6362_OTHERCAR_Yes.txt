            I had been wanting to get a Monte Carlo for about a year when I placed an order in December of '98 for a new '99 Monte Carlo Z34.  In February of '99 I went to the Chicago Auto Show and saw the new redesigned Monte Carlo...and it came with the SS designation.  Forget the '99.  I had to have the new 2000 model.  I promptly made excuses to the dealer and and canceled my order for the '99 Z34.  When they became available in October of '99 I started my search on the web to get the best price.  Unfortunately noone was willing to sell for under MSRP list price.  I Finally found a dealer in Indiana to order one for me and get it for $1500 under MSRP...fully loaded!

This is my second new car.  The first was a 1991 Camaro RS.  This is better yet.  The sporty lines,  the sinister black paint and the growl of the powerful 3.8 v-6,  Which surprised me on how quick it is.  Personally I would have preferred an LS-1 from the corvette and camaro but this engine does what you want it to.

Many of the car magazines trashed the car because it was front wheel drive and it had a v-6, but I think that it is great car.  The leather seats and very comfortable, plenty of leg room and the back seats are not bad.  I can comfortably seat 2 adults.
 
My only complaint is that the sunroof when open makes to much noise to the point that you have to yell at your passengers to hear you.  But then again,  you open all the windows and sunroof, crank up the upgraded stereo system and go cruising down the strip and watch the envy of everyone that sees you.<br><br>
