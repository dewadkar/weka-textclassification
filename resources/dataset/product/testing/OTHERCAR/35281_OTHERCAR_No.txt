            My husband and I bought a used 1996 Mitsubishi Galant and we have a 3 brand new transmissions put in it before we even drove it 1,000 miles.  We bought the car with low mileage (32,000) and was assured it was a rental from the Mitsubishi company.  At that time they had just quit the rental car business.  In the first 3 months we had 3 brand new transmissions put in because they were defective and made the car quit in the middle of the interstate.  We were also told had we not bought the extended warranty that we would have had to sue to get rid of the car.  I don't know how a new one performs but watch out for the used ones.  <br><br>
