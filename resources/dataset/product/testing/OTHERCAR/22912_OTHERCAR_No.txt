            Attention:  this is a small person's automobile.  This is my girlfriend's parents car and I've driven it (and in it as a passenger) enough times to write this review.  In fact I felt it was my obligation to anyone interested in buying this car that I warn you about its downsides.  

I don't know how much I trust Nissan--I've never had a car from the company or known anyone else who has for more than a couple of years so I can't comment on generalizations among Nissan cars.

LOOKS (C+)

It's a pretty nice looking car--I guess.  Not really my type but it's fine if that's what you like.  It doesn't look so much like a cheap car from the outside--in the right colour with custom wheels it can look like a semi-luxurious ride.  The interior is also a little bit on the basic side--some areas look like they took a page out of a children's Tonka safari car; there's cheap plastic as far as the eye can see and it shows a distinct lack of detail in my opinion.

DRIVING (C+)

It sounds a little weak when you pull up to highway speed.  Not too impressive.  It has a smooth ride though and takes to the road fairly nicely.  Regardless of its small size, handling is not great--this is mainly due to the stiffness of the steering wheel.  It takes an effort just to manuver this car.  It is a good car for gas mileage and you won't have to fill up as often as some other cars out there.  Good visibility and easy to park are other good points.

COMFORT/SEATING (C)

Good room in the front passenger seat, very poor room in the back--you can barely even fit two adults and one child.  If the person in the front is over 6' tall you could barely fit ANYONE in the back seat behind them.  The seating is very poor in the back.  I'm 6'4" and it seemed like my head was going through the roof and my knee was jacked between the seat and against the door.  If you plan on ever having tall people as passengers for any lengthy ride (like 10 minutes or more) and care about how they feel, maybe you should reconsider on this car.  In the driver seat, there was enough room for someone 6'4" to drive it normally but it got uncomfortable for me pretty quickly.  The steering wheel can adjust to a nice height to give more room which helped.  The seats themselves are fairly comfortable and provide decent cushioning, good for longer trips.

STORAGE SPACE (B+)

Has a nice big trunk that should surprise you.  The back seats also fold down for added storage area.

DURABILITY (B+)

My review here cannot be too in-depth because this car has only been driven for just about 2 years now.  However, since then there have not been any problems with the car.  I can't forecast the future but I can't see this car giving anyone any bad short-to-medium term problems.

CONCLUSION

If you are smaller than an athletic 6' and can fit comfortably into it, aren't concerned with rear seat passenger comfort, and are looking for a slightly-above-average quality ride for a decent price (depending on where you buy it), this might be a car to consider.  But, I cannot recommend it from my personal experience.
