            The Accord Coupe; half luxury, half sports.  It is expensive but does it worth shelling out big bucks.  What is the &quot;buzz&quot; that goes on with this car?  Such factors as resale value and fuel efficiency are important.  While the sound system is rather cheesy, the performance is outstanding.  If you want performance, a great place to start is with the 2000 LX Coupes with V6 engines.

To Start you off Hondas have the best resale value.  I have heard that Hondas could hold up to 50% of its original value even after 8-10 years of regular use.  If you are interested with the Accord Coupe, I would also recommend you to test drive the 2000 Toyota Celica GT, 2000 Integra, 2000 Mitsubishi Eclipse, and the Toyota Solara.  From their you could decide which car fits you best.  Make sure you are comfortable!  Just because the car looks great does not mean that you should buy it.  If you are in a crash, you are more likely to get hurt in the Integra than in the Accord; but what to drive off is your choice.

If you have decided to go with a Honda, READ ON!  If not, I have reviews on other similar cars being posted.
By now you should have narrowed down to an Accord Sedan or an Accord Coupe.  Since you have clicked on 2000 Accord Coupe, I will assume that you have picked the Accord Coupe.  Now it is your decision to pick 4 cylinder or V6.

4 Cylinder

They are rather weak comparing with V6.  However, many dealers are willing to sell you 4 cylinder models with lower APRs.  In other words, 4 cylinder models are great for teens tight on budget.  Both EX/LX model have a 2.3 liter and a 150 horsepower engine.  What does this mean?  It is slightly more powerful than the Honda Civics.  In other words, it is decent.  By the way, the 150 horsepower is at 5700 RPM.  Torque(towing power) is at 152 pounds at 4900 RPM.

V6

It is the ultimate thrill for $2000 extra(brand new of course).  With a bigger 3.0 liter 200 horsepower engine, at 5500 RPM, you will be sure to be careful how hard you put the petal to the metal.  In a long run, more people are likely to buy V6 Accords, instead of the 4 cylinder when you decide to resell your Accord.  Torque is at 195 pound at 4700 RPM.

Now it is time to decide if you want EX or LX.  The LX is the base model and the EX offers add ons as a package.  Take your time to go inside and explore showroom cars.  Here is the difference.  Make your choice.

EX

If you are an adult, chances are you want the best for your money.  You want leather seats.  You want to have your garage opener to be built into your car's system.  Also, you want to show off your 16&quot; alloy wheels.  Furthermore, you would like to feel the cool, ocean breeze massaging your body as you look up to a clear blue sky.  In addition, you are also offered an in dash AM/FM CD Player.  When you are at the freeway, you control the volume and the tracks from your steering wheel.  When you are driving 70 miles an hour, you don't have to worry about spinning out because you decided to take a second off the road just to change the tracks.

LX

If you are a teenager, chances are that you would like to have an EX.  Don't get the EX unless you are satisfied with the wheels and the sound system.  As far as I know, I would buy the Accord Coupe LX with a V6 engine.  It costs $800 extra to have the moon roof installed.  From there, I would save up money to buy customized rims and install better speakers.  Also, I would get an Alpine or a Sony in dash receiver to replace Honda's weak 80 watt four speaker system.  You get more for your money if you decide to go to the Good Guys and have them install you Sony or Alpine sound systems than to have Honda upgrade you to their cheesy 6 disc in dash CD changer.  I would recommend that you have the alarm installed at Circuit City or Good Guys since Honda's alarm is another $500 extra(Alarms are already included in EX).  It is a tamper proof Karr alarm system but when you arm/disarm the alarm, the car's honk is rather embarrassing and annoying!  By the way the seats are cloth.  If you are commuting to Vegas or the desert, chances are you want your seats to last a lifetime without maintenance.  Unless you apply a special solution regularly, leather seats will crack.  Also, you could end up with minor burns with leather seats if you park your car under the hot sun.  Cloth seats are not bad at all, leather just looks better!

The ride

Smooth and quiet as a $35,000 luxury car.  After driving 20 miles the fuel indicator moved only 1 mm. down.  In other words, it is surprisingly fuel efficient for a V6.  SMOKERS BEWARE!  This car has no ashtray!  Ashtrays are an option!  The back is roomier than the Eclipse's and the Integra's back.  With cup holders at the back, your friends should not say &quot;could you hold this for me?&quot;  There are magazine holders at the back so your friend could slip a book in and snooze with piece of mind.  What is surprising is that there is a coin organizer and a glove compartment right under it.  Yet, there is another glove compartment at the passenger side.  The AC is so powerful that you will be cold after 5-10 minutes.  This is why there is an automatic climate control feature.  The odometer is digital so you don't have to squint just to check your overall mileage.

Well there you have it!  The only problem I had with this car was minor scratches and dent.  Furthermore, the in dash control has indicated that there was a problem with the passenger side air bag.  The dealer took care of this problem for free.  To recap, if you are satisfied with Honda's stereo system and rims, go with the EX.  If you don't like the stereo and the rims, pick the LX and buy your add on toys somewhere else like at Good Guys, Best Buy, or Circuit City.  If you care about performance but can't afford the BMW or Boxter you always wanted, go with the V6.  If you just want a roomy car, go with a 4 cylinder.<br><br>
