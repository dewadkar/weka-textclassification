            We were looking to replace my wife's Mercury Sable (8 passenger seating configuration) with a mini-van. So, we began with the "usual suspects": Toyota, Honda, Mazda and Chevy Venture/Pontiac Montana. For us the "must-haves" were:
Rear A/C, 
Tow package (mainly for heavy duty engine cooling),
Cruise control.

As much as the Honda may have appealed, we ruled it out because of the outrageous pricing. We did not want to pay 30K for a minivan. If we could find a basically equipped one. Most Hondas in the area are the loaded EX variety, which put you in the 33K  range.

The Pontiac Montana could have been bought with the our required options for 21,500 (before tax and title - MSRP on that vehicle was 28,300) However, the combination of safety and reliability ruled this contender out. (Consumer Reports used to determine safety and reliability) 

The Mazda MPV was an intriguing candidate. For a MPV with cruise(standard),rear a/c, and the "4-seasons" package (beefed up engine cooling, 3,000 lb tow capacity) could have been had for 21,600 - MSRP 26,600. The seat configuration is on par with the Honda. The MPV is pretty small for a minivan, but for our family of 4, could have worked.

That brings us to the Sienna. A CE with the "extra value" package (2nd row captain's chairs, keyless entry, cruise, power windows and doors), tow package (auxillary cooling fan, 3500 lb towing capacity) and "prefered accessory kit" (cargo net, first aid kit) cost us...19,888 - MSRP 25,468.

The Sienna rides very smoothly, handles decently, has comfortable seating and accelerates nicely. (for a minivan) You will not be blown away by any one thing in particular, but the sum of the parts is very impressive. Fit and finish are what you'd expect from a Toyota, even in the CE. We've rode with 7, including a carseat and were comfortable. Just took a trip of about 1K miles, with some very long stretches of 5  hours and were very content with seat comfort.

My only complaints are: The seat configurations are not up to the Mazda/Honda standards. (or the 04'Sienna) But you do have some flexability with the "tumble forward" capability of the rear bench. And, the instrument cluster could have come off a Yugo. Very primitive. I think the only reason the CE doesn't have a tachometer was to get people to buy the LE. Why else when you can get a CE equipped with all the same options as on a base LE for cheaper?

I'll update this when I have some more time...
10 Months after purchase...
First, I realize this review was only posted recently. I'd written it some time ago, but had some problems with getting the email confirmation from Epinions. But I digress.

A few observations on our Sienna at around 10,000 miles:

MILEAGE
Our actual mileage has been about 15 city/24 highway. If you're really lead footed, I'm sure the city mileage could drop even further. The highway mileage is pretty consistent. We usually cruise at about 65-75.

COMFORT
Still very pleased with seat comfort, a/c, heat, etc. Took a long (3K miles) trip in the summer and came out of it happy. 

INTERIOR WEAR AND TEAR
The interior is a light grey and dirt does show up. Particularly on the carpet surfaces where dirty feet end up. A dark grey carpet would wear a lot better. The seats look ok, and the fake velour on both the seats and armrest surfaces don't show visible wear.

FIT AND FINISH/MECHANICAL
No annoying rattles yet, but the interior trim around the driver's side window is a bit loose. The engine is still quiet. I do notice a tiny bit of uneveness when braking. (My spouse doesn't notice it.) As we did significant mountain driving this summer, my theory is the rotors may have warped a little.

All in all, we're pretty happy.
