            I went through two other cameras before buying the Kodak DC215 and this one is tops. The box boasts &quot;Incredible pictures. Incredibly easy.&quot; These are absolutely true statements. This camera has 1152x864 pixels, 1.8 LCD,automatic, fill, red-eye and off flash modes, 10 second self-timer, 2x zoom, macro, captures JPG and standard FLASHPIX image files, date stamp, 4mb memory card and so so much more. It works with either Windows or Macintosh systems. I do suggest investing in a ac adapter though. When using the LCD the batteries go pretty quick.

I also like the size and weight of the camera. To me it is just right:-)
We have taken a lot of pictures with this camera and everyone has come out perfect. Our favorite things to photograph are sunrises and sunsets. With this camera we always get all the beautiful and brilliant colors. The zoom is easy to reach and use. 

It comes with Photodeluxe and Pagemill software. The Photodeluxe program is a fun and easy to use application. I love using this camera and software because it is so easy. It isn't a chore like some cameras when uploading pictures to your pc. With this one,you plug in the cable,switch the camera to connect and poof, you have pictures. You get to see the pictures on your pc before uploading and can choose to transfer one or all.

If you are looking for a easy to use camera that takes quality pictures then you should check out the Kodak DC215. I don't think you will be disappointed.<br><br>
