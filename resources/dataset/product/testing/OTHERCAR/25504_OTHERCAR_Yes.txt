            We bought a 1992 Mazda B-2200 extended cab in December of 1991 because my husband needed a new truck. The reason we went with the Mazda is the fact that it was the only truck that had enough room in the back seat to fit our child safety seat.

We didn't plan on keeping it this long, but after over 8 years and 65,000 miles, why not?!

We have had some mechanical work done, tune-ups, new brakes, tires and oil changes, but no major work. The ride is a little bumpy and uncomfortable, but trucks were not meant to be comfortable when we bought ours. I think the trucks of today are meant to ride like cars, but that only happened recently.

When this truck finally gives out, we will be in the market for a full-size truck, so we will have to go with another car manufacturer, but if Mazda made a full-size, we would definitely consider purchasing one.
