            Dodge Grand Caravanis a very roomy car. It also looks very sleek and cool even though it is a van. With 5 people in our family, we need all the room in cars while traveling to places. The Dodge Caravan is excellent. Even in the back, there is enough room for 3 people, and for them to stretch their legs. The trunk is roomy and handy when you go shopping for large things. The only bad thing about this van is that it breaks down very easily. Our family has had this van for 2 years, and already has seen the body shop about 5 times for break downs. But nevertheless, if your family is large, youre looking for Dodge grang Caravan. <br><br>
