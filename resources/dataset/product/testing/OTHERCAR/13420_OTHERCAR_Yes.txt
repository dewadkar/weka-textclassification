            When we went car shopping, we had big problems meeting in the middle. I wanted a camaro and he wanted a truck. I wanted something sporty and small and he wanted big and buff. Well we ended up meeting in the middle with a blazer. It's not small but it's not big, it's sporty, sharp looking, and good size 4.3 liter engine in it. 4 x 4, 4 doors, and a lot of options that we aren't used to. 

We live down a huge hill, so in the winter time the 4 x 4 is great! I'm sure it would be a great family car. We use it for normal things like shopping and work, but it is awesome for hunting and fishing. When we camp (assuming it's not raining) we flip down the back seats, flip the tail gate down, flip up the glass window, throw some blankets in there and sleep in there. 

Not only is it all conveniant for the driver it is also great for the passengers also. 
In each back door they have their own cup holder and astray, along with the window button. It also has "push on the go" 4 x 4, there are 3 buttons on the dash, they are 2 HI, 4 HI, and 4 LO. You just push the button and that's it! 

It has lots of room, (those back seats that flip down are very helpful), not bad on gas, good handling, very quiet, child resistant doors, a lock for the windows to where only the driver can control them, driver side air bag, anti-lock brakes (which I hate, but I guess people like them) Very easy to drive (backing up takes some getting used to) (I am used to driving a little saturn though, so you can imagine what that's like) the steering is tight like a performance vehicle, it rides very smooth like your floating or something, and it seams very safe, if you were to ever get in an accident, heaven forbid. I love this car so far, and have not had any problems with it
