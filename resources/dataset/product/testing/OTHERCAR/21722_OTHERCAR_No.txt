            I leased my 1998 Convertible Z24 Cavalier about three years ago.  I liked the sporty look and the relative zip and handling during the test drive.  I had always wanted a convertible, and this seemed like the perfect fit for my price range.

On the good side, the car still drives really well, although the original tires were terrible and had to be replaced after about 20,000 miles.  The convertible top is easy to use and automatic, opening or closing in about 8 seconds.  The vehicle handles well, has good pickup and braking and I still think its got very nice lines for an inexpensive domestic car.  It is VERY comfortable to drive and is one of those cars that seems to &quot;fit&quot; the driver like a glove.

The downside, unfortunately, is that this is not a very well put together car.  I have approximately 30,000 miles on it now, and have had the following problems:

The passenger side door drops slightly when ajar, making it difficult to open and close. 

The automatic driver's side window has now failed twice, needing repair both times. 

The CD changer has sounded scratchy since I bought the car, no one has been able to fix it.

Rattles like crazy, it wasn't bad when I bought it, but it has quickly become a very noisy car.  The front windows in particular rattle on any kind of road.

And the worst thing of all, is that the top leaks, sometimes badly.  I have had it in for service five times for this, and it always works for a short time after and then reverts to its leaky ways.  I understand this is a chronic problem with Cavalier convertibles, and had I known that, I never would have bought the car.  I lived in Phoenix, AZ originally, and it wasn't too much of a problem, but now living in Houston, TX and parking my car outside every day, it is.  I am constantly getting to my car after a rain storm to find the front seats soaked.

Fortunately, Chevrolet dealers have always been very helpful in terms of taking the car and doing the work for free, it just seems they can't fix everything permanently.  The bottom line is, I expected a little better engineering for my money.  If you have to have a convertible, there is no doubt this is a fun car to drive, and having the top down is a blast.  If you can stand all the nagging things that will go wrong, and live somewhere where it rarely rains, it might be an okay choice for you.  If you are looking for something solid that wont see any shop time for the first five years, look elsewhere.
