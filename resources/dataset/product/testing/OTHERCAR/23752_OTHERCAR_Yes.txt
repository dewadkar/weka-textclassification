            My wife &amp; I bought this car in 1998, and it has been a great car.  It handles fantastically, it runs well, but we found out after our 2nd child was born that there is absolutely no room in the back.  With a car seat containing a 3-yr old and a carrier/seat containing a 4 week old, my knees end up touching the steering wheel &amp; dash board.  I am 6'1&quot; tall, and I find it most uncomfortable to either drive or ride as a passenger.  I would not recommend this car or its subsequent models if you need any room for people in the back seats!<br><br>
