            I own the 2003 model. I have been driving the C230 for eight months now and it is definitely one of the most fun cars to drive. It is equipped with Auto, leather seating, CD changer, xenon headlights, dual sunroofs and heated seats. The 2002 model supposedly had troubles with supercharger lag during acceleration on the automatic models, but that was taken care of for 2003 with a new 1.9L engine. The horsepower is a few ponies less at 189hp, but when you hit the gas the car flies. Plus the 5-speed auto transmission helps alot.

At 3400 lbs, this little coupe is no lightweight, but the weight makes it feel solid in corners and on the highway. And while it isn't as quiet on the road as an S-series sedan may be, it is quite comfortable and easy to carry on a conversation. Another great thing is that German engineering is everywhere -- from the intuitive lighting controls to the funky headlamp washers and rain-sensing wipers. Although the spare tire is way too overcomplicated if you are stuck on the side of a rain-slicked road at night.

The C230 has a fairly large trunk area for the size and the rear seats are very roomy for a coupe. In fact, I am able to put my 13-month old daughter in the rear with little problem. It's not a sedan, but usable if I need to drive her in it. Without the baby seat it can comfortably seat two adults with plenty of legroom.

Now, for the value part. The car starts at around $25K which is a great price for a car company that sells cars for upwards of $60-$120K. The fact remains, that although it is loaded with air conditioning, 6-speed manual transmission and computer, you should plan on adding another $5,000 or so for options. Generally available options include the sunroofs, leather seating and option packages for rain sensing wipers, headlamp washers and xenon headlamps. Wood trim is also an option, but is hard to find since most dealers don't pre-order it. The standard aluminum trim is nice though and doesn't look or feel cheap. Also, the trip computer is very extensive. I purchased my 2003 model for around $30,000 even plus tax, which is still a steal compared to a similarly equipped 3-series BMW or even the small lexus or Infiniti. Just remember you are buying an entry-level Mercedes, not an S class. So don't expect the same level of luxury.
