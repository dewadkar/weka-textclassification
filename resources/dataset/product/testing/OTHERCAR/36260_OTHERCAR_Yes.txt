            To be short and sweet, I love this car. It just runs. The 1998 Corolla LE was the first new car I ever bought and I have been very happy. It has the go to get on the highway when I need it yet I don't have to visit the gas station very often. 

When I was about to drive it off the lot the sales person said Enjoy the car 'it will probably last longer than you want it to'. So far I am at 30K and the dealer has pleasantly fixed any problems I have had. I even got cookies and a bottle of water from my dealer after a major service.

Side note: My parents have the 1999 Camry and they are irritated that my 98 Corolla has some nicer features. 

Options above the LE trim: Side Airbags, Cruise, Flaps, Mats.

Great things: I feel good knowing there are side airbags to protect me in such a small car. Even though it's small camping trips, two people, are not a problem.

Problems: A bit noisy compared to bigger sedans I have driven but not horrible for it's class. There are quite a few cars of this make and even the same color on the road. I often have to identify my car by its unique selection of stickers and the license plate.
