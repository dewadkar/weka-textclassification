            A year and a half ago I purchased a used Jimmy, a 1994 LE to be exact.  Because I got such a terrific deal on an excellent used car, I feel the need to tell everyone I know just exactly how GREAT of a deal I got.  

Anyone in the market for a used SUV, should take at look at GMC's Jimmy.  Perhaps not as easy to find as the Ford Explorer, but they are usually offered at significant savings.

I bought my 1994 for $11,000 and it only had 26,000 miles.  It was in immaculate condition, looking as if no one had ever even sat in the seats!  The LE addition comes with all the bells and whistles - electric windows and door locks, rear defogger and rear wipers and a sound system that rivals anything I've ever heard and THIS is the sound system that comes with the car!  My husband, who owns a 1998 Altima is the music buff of the family and he is very jealous of my sound system.

I am a hockey coach and have put an additional 20,000 miles on my Jimmy, most of it carrying kids and a ton of hockey gear.  I have all the room I need and with the back seat down, I have more room than I will ever need.  It takes only one hand to put the rear seat down and is easy and simple enough to do that my 10 year can do it by herself.  

This is the most comfortable car for long drives that I have ever owned.  After 4 hours behind the wheel in route to a hockey tournament, I don't feel &quot;cramped&quot; or &quot;stiff&quot; at all, I feel like I've sat in my easy chair watching television.

If your in the market for a good used SUV, the Jimmy can be a real bargain!<br><br>
