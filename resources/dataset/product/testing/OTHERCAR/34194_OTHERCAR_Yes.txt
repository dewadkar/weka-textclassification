            In Dec of 1999 our faithful Jetta died at 160,000 miles of hard driving. I had been eyeing the Passat ever since the body style changed in 1998. Being a Volkswagon loyal, I wanted another Volkswagon, and I wanted the flagship! We bought the Passat GLX 00 in silver, with the all weather package which includes heated seats and the sound system. We also have the moon roof package.
I adore the moon roof, its quick and you just click the knob, I find it to be very precise. We have all power door locks, I love the alarm, but I have had the car for over 6 months and I still have trouble with the child resistant door locks. I am always clicking it the wrong way. Also, the cup holders are funky, and if you are holding 2 cans,  you cant quite reach the air conditioning controls.
We opted for the cloth seats, I do not care for leather. The seats are wonderful for road trips, we recently drove the car to Arizona, a 700 mile trip, its a wonderful road car. We have the Turbo engine and it is quick and responsive, I have had the car at 100 mph and it handles very well, the steering is also very responsive. I like the stiff suspension and the rack and pinion steering, one of the reasons I am such a Volkswagon loyal.
The dealership where we bought the car was in Hayward Calif and they made the buying process very easy. The first oil change was free, and Volkswagon pays for service for the 5,10 and 20,000 mile service. I just took my car in for the 15,000 mile which they do not pay for, it includes an oil change, and the cost is only $50. However, I received a lot of annoying calls from Volkswagon of America reminding me that service is due, they never seem to mark in their data base that they have already called me.<br><br>
