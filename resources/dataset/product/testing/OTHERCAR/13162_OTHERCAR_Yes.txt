            Subaru has been an automotive pioneer for decades now. Gone are the funky designs and odd looking Subarus of the 1970s and 1980s, today�s Subarus boast contemporary styling combined with technological innovation.   Take all-wheel drive for example, many modern automobiles offer this feature that Subaru, basically, brought into the mainstream. Before the quirky Subarus of the 70s, four wheel drive was generally thought of as a truck feature.  The Subaru Outback VDC is essentially the culmination of all that Subaru has accomplished thus far, it is an all wheel drive wagon with stability control or Vehicle Dynamics Control, packed full of comfort and convenience features. Although the Legacy GT wagon is the best looking Subaru, the VDC wagon is the most expensive Subaru.  A really great combination would be to put Subaru�s 3.0 L flat 6 engine into the Legacy GT wagon (maybe call it the Legacy GT-6), and give it a 5 speed manual transmission, full time all wheel drive and 16 inch wheels with Pirelli tires.  

At first glance one might be shocked by the nearly $32,000 sticker price of the Outback VDC Wagon, and the shock would be justified.  Typically, Subaru has been about value, and in fact value is just what you get when you consider the entry level price of the Legacy GT wagon which  also offers all wheel drive and a boxer engine.  In the case of the VDC, $31,895 simply seems excessive. For under $30,000 today�s new car shoppers can get behind the wheel of a loaded Toyota Camry, Nissan Maxima, Honda Accord, or even a decently equipped Dodge minivan. But in all fairness, those vehicles don�t have all wheel drive, nor are they available in station wagon form.  

Fairness requires comparing apples to apples, or in this case all wheel drive wagons to all wheel drive wagons.  The Subaru Outback VDC is the least expensive all wheel drive, 6 cylinder wagon you can get (other Subarus are less expensive).  The closest to the VDC in terms of price is the VW Passat Wagon w/ 4-motion. The Passat is an excellent car, perhaps a bit roomier inside than the Outback, and the price comes in around $32,375. More expensive, but not by much. The comparisons are few, as not many car makers offer all wheel drive wagons - Subaru has 3.  The Volvo Cross Country is an all wheel drive wagon � price: about $35,000.  Audi�s All Road is also an all wheel drive wagon- price: about $42,000. Even the Chevrolet Venture minivan has an all wheel drive version, and it�s priced at $33,120. Sure, many will complain that comparing an Audi to a Subaru is like comparing a poodle to a pit-bull, and in some ways that is true.  But one can�t help but notice, in the world of all wheel drive wagons, Subaru is running with a fast crowd.

Inside the Outback VDC, the interior feels slightly cramped.  From the outside the Outback appears to be a more substantial car than on the inside.  There is plenty of storage room in back � that�s the beauty  of  a wagon.  Seats are comfortable, but the rear seats lack adequate leg room for anyone over 5�5�. Despite the dual sunroof set up, there is still plenty of head room.  The fact that the front sunroof is flip up only is a bit of a disappointment, but that flip up only sun roof is most likely the reason for the abundant head room. The McIntosh stereo sounds very good and offers especially excellent bass response. However, the appearance of the stereo is, at best, odd.  The premium sound system has a strange black and gold look to it with two round knobs taking the place of the more modern toggle switches.  Again, the system sounds good, but it appears as if someone stole a �really killer� stereo from a 1975 Camaro, then grafted it into the Subaru.  Is that nitpicking? Sure, but remember this is a $32,000 car.

On the road, the Outback VDC feels refined, while maintaining a sporty edge.  There is little road noise, and wind noise is minimal as well.  Although it�s really cool to have two sunroofs, driving a speeds over 40 mph with the sunroof open produces a terrible fluttering sound that can only be overcome by opening a few windows. Handling is predictable and there is surprisingly little body roll considering the Outback sits about 1 inch higher than non Outback Legacy GT. The 3.0 Liter, H6 engine is not the powerhouse you might think, on paper 212 hp sounds like a lot, especially considering the Outback Wagon�s compact dimensions.  Certainly the performance is adequate, but those expecting WRX �like speed may be disappointed.  Performance expectations are high due to the Legacy GT�s already sporty 165 hp from its 2.5 Liter flat 4, the Legacy GT seems to deliver more power for its size than the H6.  Most of the 212 hp is most likely sapped by the 4 speed automatic transmission as well as the full time, all wheel drive system. What the flat 6 lacks in sheer power, it makes up for in smoothness.  Subaru has managed to make their H6 engine as smooth and refined as any V6 on the market and is, in fact, more refined and quieter than most American V6s.

Overall, both the Subaru Legacy GT and the Outback VDC are more than adequate cars.  The VDC is the ultimate Subaru for those that want the refinement of a 6 under the hood combined with the performance and safety inherent in the all wheel drive and stability control systems.  The Legacy GT wagon is a great looking car (looks more European than Japanese) with most of the features of the more expensive VDC, but at a substantial savings. If you really want an Audi All Road, but are put off by its $40,000+ price tag, consider the Subaru Outback VDC.
