            I got my Sony DSC-707 about three months ago.  I had a digital camera before, but it was a Kodak DC 120 from 1997 - fantastic for its time, but no longer enough for me because of its lower image quality and the mysterious dust that had started to gather inside the camera.  I basically felt disappointed in all the fantastic pictures I could have had, had I had a better camera all along.

I decided to purchase the Sony after my photography teacher recommended it - he has one too.  I was further convinced by the big lens (and zoom power), as well as the fantastic image quality.

After testing out the camera in the store, I was especially excited about the different modes in which one can set the camera.  I especially like taking photos at night or at concerts and other dark places, so shutter speed is the setting I need to adjust most often.  On my old Kodak, this was a very laborous process - I had to scroll through the shutter speeds with a button, which could only go upwards (so, if I was at a speed of 1 sec. and I knew I would be better off with a 1/2 sec., it would take me about a minute to go through all the speeds - and cause me to miss the picture.  With the Sony, the shutter speed is easily adjustable with a wheel right next to the picture-taking button (excuse my horrid lack of photographic action vocabulary, I'm an amateur).  And it adjusts to both higher and lower speeds - no longer will I have to scroll through a menu and miss my picture.

The camera takes pretty good close-ups with a press of the macro button, too. I use it to photograph food I make, and the pictures are worthy of some serious drooling!  Admittedly, my dad's Sony FDC-MV91 is a bit better for serious macro photography - it focuses a lot faster and can even focus on written material that is literally touching the lens.

Another feature I'd like to mention is the nightframing and nightshot capabilities.  This camera has a built-in 'night vision'.  The nightframing is for those pictures that you take almost in complete darkness - you know, you're outside at night, taking a picture of your friends, and you can't see anything through the viewfinder because it's too dark.  No need to play marco polo - turn on the nightframing, and you can see them in night vision until you press the button and take a normal picture with flash.  You can also take pictures in night vision by using the nightshot setting.  They have the usual greenish wash typical of night vision.

Basically, I haven't looked for any feature on this camera that I haven't been able to find. I even tried out the video function on my unsuspecting friends last weekend.  And the batteries seem to last for an incredibly long time, so it's perfect for bringing to parties.

The only thing I'm having a bit of trouble getting used to is the weight balance of the camera, which is quite different than the brick-like Kodak DC120 (which was rectangular, evenly weighted, and a bit heavier). I'm sure this won't be any trouble for those of you who are used to manual cameras, and I too will get used to it quickly.
