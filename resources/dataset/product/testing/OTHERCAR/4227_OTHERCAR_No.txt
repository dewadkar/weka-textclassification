            The 1994 Cadillac DeVille is a beautiful car, no doubt.  I have the 4.9L with 89,000 miles on the clock.  It is more comfortable, spacious, more stylish, simply more luxurious than any other luxury car out there.  Of course except for the Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham, but if you want to be a bit more understated, opt for the DeVille.

I am a fairly big guy, 200lbs, 6'4&quot;, and I fit in this Cadillac wonderfully (as I do most Cadillacs).  This car has it all too.  
All the normal functions on the car from the windshield wipers to the power steering to the parking brake are all catered to the drivers needs and comfort.  What that means, is that everything is easy to use, they work well, and they are thought out.  For example, the power steering is variable.  What that means is that at low speeds and when you park, there is a lot of assistance from the power steering so it is easy to park.  On the freeway or at high speeds, there is less assistance, so it is easier to handle.  The climate control system is also wonderful, and you will impress all your friends by purchasing this car.  Its the little things that make luxury cars luxurious.

Although some people are a bit skeptical about buying a front wheel drive car (as I was), don't worry.  This car handles VERY WELL and better than a rear wheel drive.  You would be surprised how nice it takes corners.  Acceleration is also very satisfying. 

On the backhand though, there are some bad points.  This car came with two options for engines:  the 4.6L northstar, pumping out about 270 horsepower, and the 4.9L (your regular pushrod V8 that you find in most other V8 cars) putting out about 200 horsepower.  Always opt for the northstar engine.  I have taken a few apart and found that they are real works of art that are revolutionizing the way engines are built and how they work.  They are more efficient, getting better gas mileage than the 4.9L, they have loads more power, and they will probably last longer too.  I won't get too technical, but that is the engine you want!

If you are looking to buy a newer DeVille (1994 and up), try to steer clear of the 1994 models.  1994 was the first year for the newer body style and as for all first year cars, they tend to have more problems than the following years.  Also the 1995 and newer DeVilles have a sleeker body style, and interior (I like them more).  A bit more technical info for you...  The 1994 DeVilles have a transaxle (front wheel drive transmission) that you need to service (change fluid and filter) every 20,000 miles.  The 1995 and up models you need to service every 50,000 miles.
Last but not least I would just like to say that owning a luxury car is expensive.  From gasoline to brakes and regular servicing to not so regular servicing.  For example, call and ask your dealer how much new shock absorbers are for this car (thats the only place you can get them).  After you regain consciousness, you'll realize why these cars ride so well.  It's about $2500 for 4 new shocks including labor!!!  OUCH!!!  My mother just bought some for her van for $30 a piece!
My advice: Lease a new one.
