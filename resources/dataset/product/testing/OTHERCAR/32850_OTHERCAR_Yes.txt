            Nikon has been known for its cameras for many, many years. It made history when it launched its 900 digital camera series in early 1998. First the 900, then the 950, followed by the "destined-to-be-classic" 990, and its latest 995. But in between the 990 and 995, Nikon launched the 880! The 880 is known as the "baby 990" among digital photography enthusiasts. A title that fits it very well. The 880 is smaller than the 990, and it is cheaper. It has about 90% of the 990 features plus some that the 990 does not have! PC World features the 880 in 1st place (June 2001). 

Why should you own a CoolPix 880?

Let's start with its low price, awesome quality pictures & great features. The price I bought it for is $575 (originally priced at $699.95) but it's going down! The quality pictures you get are just what Nikon is so famous for. The camera takes 640X480 images to 2048X1536. This larger number means you can print the image at 10.2 by 7.7 inches without losing quality!!! The features -- it has enough automation for the beginner (point and shoot), and it is the type of camera that grows with you. As you learn more about digital photography, you will find that the vast 880 features will make YOUR photography even better. One professional photographer told me that the 880's Scene Mode enables you to take pictures such portrait, beach, and landscape in a minimum number of steps! Whereas to get the same quality pictures, in other cameras lacking this mode, would take a LOT of experience! The 880 also captures 40-sec movies at 15 frames per second! I can't tell you how much I enjoy capturing those wonderful moments in this camera, and then downloading and sending these movie clips to family and friends.

You also have accessories available for the 880. You can expand your reach by using add-on lenses. Nikon offers fisheye, wide angle, 2X telephoto, and 3X telephoto lenses provided you get a $10 or less step-down ring. Although, the 880 doesn't have a hotshoe to connect an external flash unit, digislave flash units work with the camera by firing at the 2nd flash emission. I also recommend, you get the charger and rechargeable batteries because, as it is true with ANY digital camera, you will save a lot of money in the long run. And, of course, there are more accessories that you can get for this camera. :)

The 880 isn't perfect, but then again, is ANY camera perfect? I think Nikon should have included the charger and rechargeable batteries with the camera as well as included a bigger size CF card. I also would have loved it if the 880 could use the different available lenses without a step-down ring which may produce vignetting at different settings. Lastly, a hotshoe for an external flash unit is a must. But, as mentioned earlier, there is a workaround for this shortcoming.

Lastly, these cons do not make this camera any less than it is. It looks and feels great PLUS it produces excellent quality photos. Its many features give it the well deserved nickname "baby 990", a "baby" with great potential. This is the kind of camera you put on your pocket or purse so you can carry with you anywhere. It is automatic enough for the beginner, and advanced for the intermediate and professional. It grows with you. :)
