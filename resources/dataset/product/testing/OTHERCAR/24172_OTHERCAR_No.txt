            I purchased my Camaro on my birthday, May 1996. I love my car just for me. It is a small, cute car, but definitely not for family. Since my purchase I have become a &quot;NANA&quot;. Trying to get babies &amp; all their gear in this car is a chore. The ride is not smooth, &amp; there is a lot of rode noise. The purchase price was great, I got a repo with only 15000 miles, it's cute, it gets great gas mileage, &amp; it gets me a lot of attention. Ha.. The size is not the only negative for me. I have no wrecks, &amp; no tickets. The insurance is pitiful. I have to pay teenage, high risk rates just because it is a CAMARO. This car is for someone that wants to just be cute at a price. I would not really recommend it to anyone.<br><br>
