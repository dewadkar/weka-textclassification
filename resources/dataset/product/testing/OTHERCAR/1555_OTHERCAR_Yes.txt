            When we got out Dodge Caravan I was thrilled with it.All the room and the extended wheel frame made for a lot of room to take lots of things with us.
The interior of the van has a lot of plastics that snap in place.As a result of this we have lots of rattles.Some of the parts came off and had to be put back while other parts broke.Was getting unreal when you consider there was  no kids in the car since they were all grown.
Then came the air condition.Every summer we have to get it recharged.A service place told us Chrysler was good for this and they never fixed the problem in the vans.The cost of this costs us over a hundred every spring.
We went to Chrysler with this problem and they told us it was not under there warranty.You have to have extended policy for this.
That was only part of the problems we have had with this van and we bought it new.
I would like to say we have always had Chrysler products but now thing  about another product who who will stand behind there products.
