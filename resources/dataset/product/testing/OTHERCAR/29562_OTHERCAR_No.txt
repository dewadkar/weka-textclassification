            This was my first digital camera, and considering all of my problems with it, nearly my last. I primarily bought this to use for auction photos, and did not expect a high quality picture. I did however expect some reliability from it. Within 30 days, the battery compartment hinge broke, and the camera ceased to function. Repeated e-mail to Vivitar went unanswered. I finally looked to see if I could figure out what was wrong, and discovered with the cover broke the batteries did not make good contact. I solved this by taping the cover closed. Within two months, picture quality began to decline(poor to begin with) and colors were terrible. I finally decided this was because the auto flash was not working correctly. Since what little time it had worked, it had eaten batteries like a Cadillac eats gas, I decided that enough was enough. It still sits in my junk box downstairs. A sad reminder of $160.00 thrown away. Considering the fine performance I have had with a Vivitar scanner, I would suggest they stick to other products than cameras.<br><br>
