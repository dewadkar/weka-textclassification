            I was looking for a ultra-compact camera with a 3x optical zoom for my wife to be able to carry around in her purse.  I compared the ultra-compacts by Canon S400 (too big and heavy), Pentax Optica S (too small), Minolta Xi (too square), and Fuji F410 (awkward design) and found that this Casio felt just right - not too big and not too small.  

The design allows for a comfortable grip despite being less than 1" in depth and weighing in at around 5 oz.  How they got a 3X zoom in this package amazes me (made by Pentax).  The 2" screen is unique to all others and really helps someone with far sightedness.  

The photo quality for a 3 pixel camera is excellent and rivals my 4 pixel Minolta F100 camera in comparing 4x6 photos.

The camera comes with a docking cradle that is also unique in that it serves various functions: 1) battery recharger; 2) direct download to your computer via USB port; and 3) allows automatic slide show of your pictures.

The only downside I have found so far is that because of the lightness of the camera you may tend to move your hands when shooting so you need to hold steady when shooting.  You can use the viewfinder to steady the shot but it is very tiny.  If you have large hands/fingers this may also be a difficult camera to manage the function keys.

Paid $399 (US) at Ritz Camera store.
