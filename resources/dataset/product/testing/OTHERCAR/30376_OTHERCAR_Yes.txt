            We were looking to replace our '94 Dodge Grand Caravan that had served us well over the years therefore, we checked out Minivans, SUVs and briefly thought about a larger sedan. Thought we would check out GMC Jimmys and saw the Pontiac AZTEK which really caught our eye.  Styled for the new millenium you could tell this vehicle was not only different but functional from the start.  With a &quot;What's that?&quot; - our journey begins.  

On approach, the AZTEK is commanding with the low entry height compared to the visibility height when in the vehicle.  As soon as you open the doors, you know you're in for something special.  The front upholstered seats are very comfortable for short or tall people as well as practical with the camouflaged-type pattern.  The rear seats sit higher so rear passengers are not only comfortable, but can see clearly all around.  Ample leg room and head room in the rear is something we haven't seen offered in any other vehicle on the road.  This car can set 5 TALL adults comfortably.  

Engineers and designers took time for the little things that people do and need on a day-to-day basis:  Like the large glove compartment that folds ALL the way down for those drive throughs;  the dual climate control will settle all disputes on the hot and cold issue;  separate rear passenger air vents to settle the &quot;Where's the air?&quot; disputes you hear; windshield wipers that actually clear the ENTIRE window; cup holders that hold large drinks for the front and 2 cup holds per rear side; and portable bags in the front doors for pick-up-and-go times.

The Pontiac AZTEK is made for the active couple or family whether you're a soccer mom, avid outdoor person, or simple an older couple who is young at heart and likes to travel in comfort and style.  The AZTEK has a 3-fold design in that it is roomier and better gas mileage than the SUV Chevy Blazer;  more versatile, stable and has better maneuvering than the minivans; and finally, has the ride and road handling of a sporty sedan.  

Features, features, features - What do you want? Pontiac thought of it in the AZTEK.  Optional Onstar system and separate radio/CV controls for the rear passengers or sunroof.  We got the 10-Pioneer speaker system (2 subwoofers)with 6-CD changer.  The &quot;Scat Cat&quot; also has a rear radio with controls for tail-gating, camping or whatever.  We got the pull out cargo tray (holds 400 lbs.)  This has hidden compartments to tuck away all of those things that people have rolling around in their cars, plus more.  It actually pulls out for easy grocery loading.  The tray is portable and easy to remove and roll away when you want to replace it with: the camping option- tent and air mattress.  The air mattress is inflated with the air compressor that's built in the rear side of the Aztek which is used for load leveling on a daily basis.  Perhaps you want to hike - the hiking option comes complete with backpacks, rubber floor mats and removable seat covers.  There's even a biker's package and sports package.
Whatever your needs or fun is, there's sure to be a package to please that reasonably priced.

When I first drove the AZTEK at night - I felt it needed a soundtrack.  With the keyless entry, all the lights come on and upon entry in the driver's seat, the red display makes you think mission control should authorize you for departure.  

Pontiac took a lot of time thinking about the controls.  They have extra the radio/CD controls on the steering wheel with a MUTE button.  The cruise is conveniently located on the lane changer as well as the windshield wipers.  The lights have an AUTO feature with photosensor so, you don't ever had to turn your lights on or off.  There are fog lights as well.  The dual climate control is marvelous for those &quot;can't make up you mind days&quot;.  Power driver seat is great for the Mutt and Jeff people we are.  (Would be nice to have the settings memorized for driver 1 and 2).  The Driver Information System is fantastic for trips or around town, giving gas mileage information, how far you have to go before filling up, which is based on your driving habits.  These can be set for driver 1 and driver 2.  6 diferent ways you can decide how you want you doors to lock and unlock and many, many other features.  Heads-up display is also available.

Safety, safety, safety.  The wide Pontiac stance gives this vehicle the ride and stability of a sedan.  Daytime running lights and the AUTO light feature is great.  Wide windows gives you the glass bubble feel, especially with the option sunroof.  Front and side airbags are standard.  Antilock brakes are standard.  The front wheel drive comes with the Pontiac Positraction control for great handling on those not-so-nice days of snow and mud.  All wheel drive option is coming soon, but you will probably have to sacrifice the great gas mileage and sedan ride for it.

We obvious bought this vehicle and are having a great time with it.  Cars have always been just transportation for me, and I have never understood the love affair thing that guys have with vehicles.  All of that has changed.  We flip for who gets to drive the &quot;Scat Cat&quot;.  I highly recommend this vehicle and think it will be a sleeper until the word gets out.  The exterior styling is new millenium and nonconformist which might turn some off - but once they see the interior and feel the great ride, there's no need for the salesman.  Hats off Pontiac - you did a great job.

P. S.  I hear the engine needs no scheduled maintenance for 100,000 miles.  Obviously, we'll have to wait a few months before we can report on this.  But, I do like the only gas and oil theories.<br><br>
