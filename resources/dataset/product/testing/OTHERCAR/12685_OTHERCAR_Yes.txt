            I Own a 1997 Cavalier 2 door. I think it looks really sharp - but of course, I'm prejudiced. It has air bags and anti-lock brakes which are both great safety features. The 3 speed transmission shifts very smoothly. It has plenty of spunk, and I have no problem passing cars when I have to.

The ride, I think, is very smooth. It seems, so far, to be very reliable.  I bought it used over a year ago, and have had no mechanical problems (thank God!).

My Cavalier has almost 50k miles on it. And I think it will serve me well for many years.

The only bad things about it are the interior plastic components. A few of the snap on plastic molding parts are broken or about to break.

Over all, I give a thumbs-up!
