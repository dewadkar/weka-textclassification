            Diesel.  This is a word that conjurs opinions from automobile owners of noisy, dirty cars and especially trucks.  Obviously these people have never been introduced to the Volkswagen TDI line of cars.

The TDI is a fantastic diesel engine!  Turbocharged and quiet it zips through city traffic with ease and sips fuel (you have to learn to quit calling it gas) like a bird.

The TDI is available in the New Beetle, Golf, and Jetta.  I chose the Jetta because of its size.  I preferred the Passat but it's not available in the US with the TDI.

The Jetta is a really fun car to drive.  Well built and tightly finished it glides through traffic with ease.  I have the 5-speed (automatic?  YUCK!) and it shift effortlessly and really gives you a feel for the road.

The finish of the car is excellent.  I have had no problems with my vehicle, which currently has 28,000 miles on it.  I drive a lot for business, and it's wonder putting down 35 cents/mile on an expense report when my cost for fuel is less than 3 cents/mile.  You read it right...  THREE CENTS PER MILE.

The Jetta is rated at 42 MPG city and 49 MPG highway.  That is on the low side.  I typically run about 45 in the city and 53 highway.  This thing doesn't know the meaning of empty!  People hop inside I make sure to point out the odometer reading to them.  350+ miles on the trip odometer and still well over half a tank!  I will get over 700 miles on a tank (highway) before I hit the filling station.  

Speaking of the dash.  The Jetta has this eye-catching color scheme of purple lighting with red/orange indicators.  It seems like a neon glow at night but is very well designed to only bring necessary information to the driver's eyes.  Plus it down right just looks cool!

OK... after the glowing... the downsides of the Jetta.

The rear seat is cramped.  For kids it's just fine, except that they put their feet all over everything (front seats especially) so get the dark interior.  My beige interior is fighting a losing battle.

I've heard rumors (hasn't happened to me yet) that VW has a problem with window regulators.  I've had this confirmed by VW service but (knocking on head/wood) I haven't been hit yet.

The front bumper spoiler is WAY too low to the ground.  If you pull up too far on a parking curb it will glide across it.  But when you back up if the rebar rod in the parking curb are sticking up they will grab the spoiler and rip of off the bumper.  I've had it happen twice to me.  Figure $200-$500 to fix it.  Of course, after it happens you learn how to park it.   :)      Easiest thing to do is either not pull up all the way in the parking space or back it in.  The rear bumper is way high and the car is short enough that you can park short to the curb and still be well inside the space.

Would I buy it again?  YES!  Personally I'm waiting for the diesel Passat to land in the US.  VW... are you listening????  

I hope this helps...   also, for great VW TDI information try going out to http://www.tdiclub.com  and you'll see a TON of information from owners regarding every aspect of the TDI.
