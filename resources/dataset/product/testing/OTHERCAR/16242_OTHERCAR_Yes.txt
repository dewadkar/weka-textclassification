            I chose a new car because of the warranty.  I chose a Toyota Corolla because of the manufacturer's reputation for reliability.  I expect a Toyota to last much longer than most other cars.  

The 1999 Corolla has a lot of great little features that come standard, including a driver's side vanity mirror, 3 cup holders, daytime running lights, a radio with cassette player and a light inside the car that has a delay before it goes off.  There is a lot of trunk space, and driver's side and passenger side airbags.  The car makes very little noise when running.  Most importantly, it drives very smoothly.

I was unhappy with few things about my new car.  It doesn't have a dashboard clock (something that I had come to depend on and really miss).  It also comes with headrests for the back seats.  It may not be a problem for other people (height could be a factor), but they caused a major blind spot for me.  It was simple to fix, however.  I now drive around with one of them in my trunk.  The car is also unbelievably low to the ground.  The first time I drove with 4 people in my car, I was very surprised by how little it took to cause the bottom of the car (muffler?) to scrape on the ground.  

Overall, I love the car.  It drives great and I am confident that it will last me a very long time.<br><br>
