            We bought this car new off the showroom eight months ago.  I sold my Mercedes and bought the Volvo C-70 convertible high powered turbo.  What a mistake.  The car has less than 8000 miles.  I have owned cars for twenty-five years and have never had a car with as much trouble and with such sorry service.  First, we had the car packed up with the kids and were going to the beach for a week.  I checked the oil before we pulled out of the driveway.  The dipstick handle broke off in my hand when I tried to pull it out.  So I called the Volvo dealer.  It would take a week to get the part in and then they would need the car for several days to repair it.  I wasn't willing to take the car on a several hundred mile trip and not be able to check the oil.  So we had to unpack the car and take our other car.  So it sat in our garage then the dealerships garage for almost two weeks.  A month later I was putting the top up before a thunderstorm and it stuck in the open position.  I had to manually raise the top but not before the interior and me became soaked.  It takes about thirty minutes to manually raise the top.  I took it to Volvo of Greenville (SC) and it has been there going on four weeks.  I was told three times the past week that they don't know what is wrong with it.  The service manager told me it is tying up his service bay.  They refuse to loan me a car because I bought it at the Savannah dealership (I've since moved to the Greenville area).  They assured me again they would call me today and update me with the latest theory of why it is broken.  Guess what, they didn't call.  I called Volvo customer service 800 number and was told it would take three days to investigate this problem.  I asked the person on the other end of the line to have someone in management call me.  Guess what-no one called today.  In the meantime I have to have my wife drive me to work and when I am on call (I am a surgeon) it is a real pain in the you know what.  What a joke of a car and company.  I could have bought a Yugo for a lot less money and gotten this kind of car and service.  I will never buy a Volvo again and will sell this one as soon as I get it back, whenever that is.  I actually drove a 1979 VW today because it is more reliable than this Volvo piece of junk.  Their ads brag about how safe they are.  Sure, because they sit in either your garage or the dealership's garage forever.  This pile of junk has sat for the past six out of eight weeks.  Never again.  If you want a Swedish convertible, buy a Saab.  My father has had a Saab convertible since '88 and has never had any problems.  Wish I had done the same.  <br><br>
