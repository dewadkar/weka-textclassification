            My wife and I were looking for a SUV in the price range of $17,000.00 to $25,000.00.  With this price that gave us room to look at many other SUV's.  We first saw the Rav4 we weren't sure if it was enough truck or not.  So we ask the dealer (Thomson's Toyota in Edgewood Md.) if we could test-drive the SUV.  It had everything as an option i.e. electric mirror adjustments, two-way moon roof, luggage racks, six CD changer and tape deck.  Wipers in the rear window, the back seats can roll forward so that the space in the back of the front seats is enormous.  The engine is so quite that you sometimes don't think that the truck is on.  Now when the winter comes we are going to have some fun in the snow.  The gas mileage is somewhere around 22 to 30 miles per gallon.  That's wonderful and it takes 87 octane.  The back door is very large and basically is the whole back of the truck.  It also has little extras like warnings when you are low on window washer fluid, or that your gas cap is not on.  Power windows, power doors just finishes off our best buy in 1999.  By the way (Monty at Thomson's Toyota) is a great Christian salesman that was honest and fare with our final price. To top off the sales we were able to take the Rav4 home and never gave it back!:&gt;)

Sincerely,

Rob &amp; Bea Allen
