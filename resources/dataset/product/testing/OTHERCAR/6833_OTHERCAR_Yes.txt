            I do not profess to be an expert on automobiles.  My knowledge of maintenance and mechanics is limited to routine check-ups and what I read in <i>Consumer Reports</i> and <i>Road & Track</i>.  I recently inherited co-ownership of a 1995 Subaru Legacy wagon, and I have definite mixed emotions.  To shed some light on this topic, a list:

<b>PROS:</b>
1) For winter weather, traveling in snow and ice, and climbing slippery slopes, there is no finer maker of automobiles.
2) The Subaru brand name is a highly dependable one.  People who need one for the above reason tend to be repeat buyers (my family has owned three of them.)
3) More-than-ample cargo room in the back.  We packed luggage for 4 adults, a wheelchair, and an oxygen exchanger, and I could still see out the rear window.
4) Spacious.  Those 4 adults sat fairly comfortably in this car for over 6 hours each way.
5) I feel safe in my Subaru.
6) Higher than average resale value.

<B>CONS:</b>
1) Subarus tend to run somewhat high in price.  They have basic models which start at about $15,000, but the average car with standard equipment will rarely leave the showroom for less than $20,000.  (The mid-class Forester with the average options package costs about $24,500.)
2) The gas mileage is, at most, fair.  My Legacy has been averaging around 19 city, 24 highway.
3) Road noise is not well controlled.  Raising your voice to be heard can lead to minor throat pain.

<b>PROBLEMS THAT MIGHT ONLY BE WITH MY CAR:</b>
1) When the windshield was replaced, half of the fuses were blown soon after the repair. 
2) That wasn't the first time the fuses have died young.
3) Pick-up is not at a premium here.  You may have to floor it to get into those highway merges.
4) The brakes seem a bit soft.  Maybe they just need to be replaced.  We'll get that checked out.
5) When braking, the car does a little dance which is reminiscent of a grande mal seizure.  Again, new pads?
6) Something is wrong with the starter.  I think.  Well, let's draw you a picture.  One day I go to start my car, and it decides it would rather sleep in.  No <i>click</i>, no noise of any kind other than the <i>bing-bong</i> of the seatbelt-reminder.  We call the station, they come to tow it away.  It starts for them.  Hmm.  They take it anyway, and the mechanic says that it was probably the starter motor.  "Okay," says I, "Replace it."  They do, we get it back, it works.  So on my way home from a 350-mile trip this weekend, I stop for gas.  After filling up, my car is apparently tired.  Hmm.  Won't start again.  No <i>click</i> which would indicate a battery failure, just nothing.  I contemplate my options.  150 miles from home.  Brother, mother, and elderly aunt in the car.  95 degrees.  So we wait 5 minutes and try again.  Nothing.  Open the hood, you say?  Okay.  Damned if I know what I'm looking for.  Brother, turn the key.  It starts.  Okay, so I don't know what's wrong, I spent $400 on an unnecessary starter, and it can happen at any time.  We're calling Subaru in the morning.

Having said all of this, I still stand behind the brand.  I've been pricing a new Forester (my next car, I'm pretty sure,) and still have confidence in the purchase.  I would advise considering the extended warrantee, and only think about this car if you're in an area where it's needed.  Subaru comes standard with 4 wheel drive, and I have yet to see a car perform better on snow, slush, or ice.  Make your own decision as to whether the pros outweigh the cons.
