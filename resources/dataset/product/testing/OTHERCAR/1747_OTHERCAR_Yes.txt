            I use to own a 95 Firebird-- man, that thing drove so great!!!  I was very comfortable to drive for the driver &amp; was able to pass anything quickly &amp; easily.  They are also beautiful cars!!  Performance-wise it was a dream.  I loved that car.  There were drawbacks which caused us to sell it though- mainly for the passengers.  If you rode shot gun for a long distance, you'd get leg cramps.  It was like your legs were straight out in the floor board and it was tough.  The backseat was small- two people max &amp; the real trouble came when you had small children in car seats.  I literally had to fold the front seat down and step into the back floor board in order to pull the kids out of their seats.  It sat way low to the ground &amp; was very ackward.  For a single person, this car was affordable &amp; just rocked!!  For a family, you will probably end up doing what we did after about a year, and finally break down &amp; trade it for a four door.<br><br>
