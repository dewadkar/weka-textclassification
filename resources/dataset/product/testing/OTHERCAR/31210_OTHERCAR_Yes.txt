            This 60 year old grandmother bought a Jeep Liberty Limited about a month ago after driving a KIA Sportage for four years.  I was drawn to the Liberty by its great look and way it handled during the test drive. The bonus was the model I selected has more bells and whistles than I know how to use yet. 

 I chose a salsa red Limited 4x4  with pale gray leather interior. The color is vibrant and turns a fiery red in the sunlight. It sure  turns the heads of some good looking guys with it's classy looking SUV design. 

The front bucket seats are comfortable and easily adjust with the multi-level electric selector. The plush leather seats make for additional comfort and a feeling of luxury. I also appreciate the tiltable steering wheel. Adjustable height seatbelts are a plus since I'm a bit short. The electric window levers are located on the middle console which tends to be a bit awkward. The dash has gorgeous dials with easy to read displays during daytime and at night. There is ample headroom, and elbows don't bump between driver and passenger. Both sun visors flip down to reveal lighted mirrors, much needed by those who must apply their mascara while doing 80 down the freeway.

 Although I haven't sat in the back seat yet, it's ideal for my grandkids. The back seats do fold forward and lay flat for additional cargo space.  You'll find handy cup holders on each door for back seat passengers.

There is an excellent radio/stereo system with 6 CD holder. The speakers are so magnificent they will rattle your bones. One negative for the interior is the lack of a foot rest for the left foot while driving. However, the console between driver and passenger seats is well designed for comfort and use.

Cargo space in the back is minimal, but I really like the cover in the cargo department. After shopping you can roll and snap this into place thus hiding packages, etc. There are a couple of tie downs there too to hold items in place.  The bonus for me is that with just a couple of clicks of the alarm button, the back window pops open automatically. When my hands are full this feature is most appreciated. The two part back door is ideal. With just the upper window portion open you can still put packages into the cargo area without opening the lower portion of the door.  I do have a complaint about this back window as it's very difficult to see through with the rear view mirror. The tint is too dark. At night it's almost impossible to make out images behind the car.  

The heated side mirrors are a dream. No more rain or fog to block my view. The rear window also defrosts and sports a wiper that is very efficient. I now have my first fog/running lights and they are super for night driving on dark country roads. 

Now for performance. This granny doesn't drive slow, so I am happy to say this car responds to my every command. Having driven 4 cylinder vehicles for the last decade the 6 cylinder is a treat (except when I visit the gas pumps). Acceleration from a stop is excellent. Passing is not a problem. Merging onto the freeway is a snap. I find no problem with performance in this area. I'm anxious to try it in the mountains during the coming holiday season. Cruising speed is so smooth and so is the suspension. I live in an area with countless potholes and poor road conditions, so the car's performance over roads of this type was one thing I checked during test drive. The car takes the bumps without a rattle or chatter. The driver feels little, if any, jar.  There is no wind noise at high speed either.

I like the way the car holds to the road. Also  braking is superb; it feels like the wheels are grabbing the pavement when I come to a stop.  When turning corners though the car takes them a bit wide compared to my old KIA. I'm adjusting to this longer wheelbase.

Low gas consumption is not on my winning list for the Jeep Liberty. My lead foot and the 3.7L V6 have given me about 15 mpg. Most of this driving is in town, and minimal rural roads. I am hoping that on long road trips this number will increase, especially since it does have the automatic overdrive feature. Today, I had the let the tank get to near empty. I  was nearly scared out of my seatbelt by a very loud "bong." At first I thought it was an air raid warning coming over the radio because it was such an alarming sound, but then I realized it was just the warning for low fuel. The tank gulped nearly 16 gallons at the warning level.

In my opinion, I got a lot of luxury and a lot of car for my bucks. The Jeep is such a pleasure to drive I find myself making excuses to go somewhere. I would encourage anyone interested in purchasing an SUV to test drive the new Jeep Liberty. I think you will agree that it's an exciting new model to own and to drive.
