The Saturn SW2 wagon has become our back-up vehicle of choice (it's just not big enough for full-time family mobility).

As a growing family, currently three of us, we needed more room. Besides the requisite car seat we also needed to fit a stroller, diaper bag, food bag, suitcase, and more whenever we were going on a short trip.

We upgraded our Saturn SL2, the sedan, to the Saturn wagon in hope of capturing some extra space. Although the hatch in the back helps, the storage space is barely larger than the trunk in the sedan. Typically our stuff was piled to the roof and in the extra space in the passenger seats.

However, if you are looking for a quality family vehicle with a little pizazz under the hood, the Saturn SW2 will fit the bill. It is very comfortable, has a good sound system, and never, ever gives us trouble.

Unfortunately, we had to get a Ford Explorer to accomodate our growing list of equipment on a regular basis, but for quick family trips the Saturn is still our favorite pick.<p>
