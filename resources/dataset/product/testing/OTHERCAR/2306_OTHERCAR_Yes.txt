            I purchased my KIA Sephia LS in December of 1998. At the time I had really liked the car, based on appearance and pricing. I had not known of anyone who owned one, but had seen quite a few on the road. So I bought the showroom model.

It is an attractive, loaded model. For around $13,000 I received the deluxe sound system, which truely does perform! It has been used at many parties!! I love the woodgrain trim package, it really sets off the interior. I also enjoy the power package, with power locks/windows.

As of present, my KIA has over 53K miles on it. I mentioned in the "cons" section that I had to deal with several recalls in the beginning. I feel these were due to the 1999 model being new! The KIA dealership treated me well each time I took my car in. The recalls involved a bad connection with the fuel pump, defective rotors on the front brakes and a windshield wiper bracket problem. I was in and out within an hour with each recall service. 

Currently I am into my thrid year of ownership of my KIA. I have not yet regreted the purchase of this car. It has been dependable, and is relativley cheap on upkeep. I am looking into purchasing a new KIA next year. Not for any reason other than to have a newer model.
