            On January 31, 1998 I took delivery of a left over 1997 Geo Tracker, 2WD,Convertible.  I traded in a 1992 Nissan Sentra XE 2dr which was very problematic.  Since that time I have been driving along very happy in my Tracker.  The vehicle is very fuel efficent, fairly reliable, and tons of fun to drive.  I like the convertible option on my vehicle.  Its perfect for the South Florida region.  I wouldn't recommend the convertible for those in the Northern Section of the country however. 

 Since taking delivery of my Tracker I now have 44,500 miles on it.  It has not been a completely flawed vehcile to own however.  At about 10,500 the air conditioning compressor went out on the vehicle.  I was not to happy at that time because it of course happened in the dead of summer on a day in which the temperature reached about 96 degrees.  The air conditioning problem was fixed under warranty and I was soon back on the road to enternal bliss.  At about 15,000 miles the clips that hold the back window into place broke.  This took about 3weeks for the parts to come in.  During that 3week wait it had rained quite a bit so the interior did acquire a little water damage.  The clips did break again shortly before the warranty ran out and were replaced a second time.  The last and most recent repair was at 38,000 when I noticed a loud tapping noise in the engine.  Later the tapping noise was accompied by the &quot;CHECK ENGINE&quot; light that refused to go away.  Of course since the very short GM warranty had expired this repair was on my shoulders.  According to the Chevrolet dealer in town I a blown EGR valve.  This was corrected in a matter of a day and was a fairly inexpensive repair ($118.00). 

 Over all I am satisfied with my purchase.  I would have to say that when it does come time to purchase another vehicle I don't think another Tracker will be in my driveway.  I will probably choose a vehicle from one of the better know Japenese makers.  I would recommend this vehicle to those people who are looking for a fun, expensive vehicle.<br><br>
