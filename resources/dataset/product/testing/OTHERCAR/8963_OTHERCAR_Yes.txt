            I bought a 93 Mercury Topaz. I bought this car a year ago because I needed a car that was better for long distance road travel than my 84 Toyota 4x4 Pickup was.  I bought it last year with 8700 and now it has almost 100000.  Over the past year the only repairs that I have had to do are the standard repairs for a car with as many miles as this car has on it.  This car has the 2.3 liter engine, automatic transmission, air, power locks, power windows, power drivers seat and tilt steering wheel.  It gas mileage ranges between 22-25 in the city and 25-29 on the highway.  I have not had any problems with any of the electronic devices in this car.  The engine is very well powered and the car has very good acceleration.  The car also has very good handling under typical driving conditions and under heavy acceleration.  all of the controls are very well marked and easy to reach.  For a car of its size it has a great deal of interior space.  I am very glad that I selected this car and would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a reliable mid-sized car.<br><br>
