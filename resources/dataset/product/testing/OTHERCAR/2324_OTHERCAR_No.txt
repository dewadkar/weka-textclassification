            Here is a car that is cheap.  It may cost little in the short run, but in the long run you are going to have more problems with these than you will with any other car you may buy.  You have no power, you have no control over slippage except for the tires, these cars are so compact that a single accident will probably total this car.  So cheap is the word.  To be honest I would not put a baby in a Kia.  They are too dangerous.  I have made a little table again if you would like to know the disadvantage and advantages of these cars:

ADVANTAGES:

These cars are really cheap, you usually have friendly service when you plan to buy the car.  The lights are highly visibile.

DISADVANTAGES:

In the long run it will cost you money to get the car fixed.  Only 2% of the car is actually made in the USA.  No Power, Gas Mileage goes way down after a month.  They are compact, compact.
