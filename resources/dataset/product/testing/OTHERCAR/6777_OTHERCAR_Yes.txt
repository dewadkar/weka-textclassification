            I bought my 97 Plymouth Breeze 4-Door two years ago from a major rental car chain. It had 30,000 miles on it and now, about 2 years later I'm approaching 80,000.  Okay, first I have to say WHY I bought this car. First of all, it really is a sporty car! It has a very cool, aerodynamic look to it. Secondly, I'm a big guy. I have a hard time fitting into some cars, especially 'compact' or sports cars.  I have NO trouble fitting in the Breeze, nor does anyone else. Everyone is very impressed with just how MUCH room is in the 4-door. LOTS of ROOM!! That was a big selling point. 

Now here's what i don't like about the car.  First, it's a 4 cylinder, which means obviously it takes a tad more physical effort to propel the car-but that is NOT the car's fault. Anyway, driving the car is a pretty good experience. It starts with no problems, takes off fast and have no trouble going 80 in traffic on the way home from work.  I take excellent care of my car, changing the oil every 3,000 miles which, for me, is every 6 weeks.  

Ive heard people talk about problems with the head gasket an oil leaks with the 97 Breeze's and I have to tell you, I had the same problem.  A month after I bought it, that's what had to be changed. For about a year or so, it was smooth sailing.  Last month at 65,000 miles, I had to change the spark plugs and drive belts on the car ($185.00).  The car tends to shake just a little if you go over 65. 

The one thing I most HATE about this car and I might be wrong, but no one seems to be aware of the problem, nor does the mechanics who work on it.  The A/C goes out from time to time.  &quot;Well, that happens in some cars&quot; you might say. But along with the AC, the vent no longer works either.  I will just be driving along, and all of a sudden- NO AIR. The vent wont blow anything out except a slithering whisp.  After I park the car and it sets for a few hours, the AC will work again.  

I had to replace the entire steering column because when I adjusted the steering wheel, it broke (while I was driving)-scary. My driver's door pops really loud when I open it.

So in closing, despite the repairs-most of which were covered in warranty and extended warranty options, the Breeze really is a great car. In it's defense, I take care of my car, but i also push it hard, driving over 30,000 miles per year and I think it's held up awesome.  It's a great, roomy sporty looking car and so far, the repairs have been very affordable and it's proved to be an awesome, dependable car. It's never broke down and refused to start. I love it, but it has a temper.
