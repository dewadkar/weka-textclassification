            I've owned my '91 Intergra LS Hatchback for two years now, and I've learned a lot about being in love with a car.  My first auto was a truck, an old, beat up little truck, it did me well, but didn't provide me with the kind of power and handling I wanted.  Next, I came upon a scrappy old mid 80's &quot;sports&quot; car (econo-sporty).  It was slick, a stick, and could take off at a decent clip, but due to wear and tear, I was still jealous of everyone else on the road.

It all changed for me the first time I took my Integra out, having gotten used to the stick and the clutch, and opened it up on the Interstate.  Thank God the cops were sleeping that day, because I was flying along at about 120, handling the car like an old arcade game, when you want to switch lanes you just think about it and suddenly you're there.  Coming down the entrance ramp, I gave myself whiplash jamming on the gas.  Ok, it's not a Vette, but hey, I didn't pay for a Vette, either.  

Now I have a job that requires me to drive 40 minutes every morning.  I hate having to wake up earlier, I hate having to pay for gas (although I should note that the mileage is great - about 26mpg on a 9 1/2 year old car which has been well taken care of.  I hate watching the odometer go higher and higher, although it's not something I worry about.  Everyone I've spoken with and everything I've seen shows that the 120,000 miles this baby's racked up brings it to the equivalent of a teenager, and it's got a lot more to go.  One thing I don't dread is sitting in my Integra for that trip.  I'm a computer technician at a school district, and I rack up quite a few miles just during the day.  You can't make me happier than to tell me that I have to drive to the furthest school to do some work... extra driving time, and I get PAID for it!!  I can't say enough good things about this car.

Do the basics, have a mechanic check it out, give it a good examination, take it for a ride, but if the deal's right, and the car's in good condition, by all means, the Integra is a great ride, a relaxing drive, and a wonderful car to own.<br><br>
