            I wanted to try an inexpensive digital camera before investing in a more expensive one. 

Well, I lived and learned once again because this experience reminded me that we only get what we pay for and all I got from this was headaches and junk pictures.

I bought this camera in September 2002 and by November 1, I disconnected it from my computer. The camera never took a decent picture.  It sits in a desk drawer and is headed for the trash.  I tried 10 fresh sets of batteries in this thing and they will not work so your photo range is limited to the length of your USB cord.  Ahhhh, there is nothing like being tied to a leash while you are trying to take pictures.

The few photos I was able to get this thing to take were almost unrecognizable.  They were of very poor quality, grainy and distorted.  They looked as though they had been taken with a fish eye lens on a 35 mm.  

I called customer support once and sat on hold forever. I never did get get to speak to anyone about the problems I was experiencing. I imagine they were busy listening to others (who were lured into buying this unphotgenic product by the price) complain about the fact that this camera does not work.

I chalked this one up to a bad experience but a good lesson.  Buy quality products if you expect quality performance -- and this isn&#146t it.
