            The Jeep Grand Cherokee is the best!  First, the exterior styling is wonderful and the interior is the same.  Also, with the introduction of the spare tire underneath the car instead of on the side of the trunk has made the car even better.  Even though there are many models available, they are all great.  The front seats are large and roomy and the back seats are very comfortable, comfortable enough for road trips.  Need an SUV to tow a boat or trailer?  Then choose the Jeep Grand Cherokee.  There are several engine choices including the 4.7 liter V-8, the 5.2 liter V-8, and the powerful and fuel efficient 4.0 liter 6 cylinder.  And all these features plus more, for less than other luxury sport utility vehicles.  The  Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited with a V-8 is the same price as the Lexus RX-300 with a 6 cylinder!  And the Laredo is less!  Wether you choose the Laredo or the Limited,  you are getting a great SUV.  Most people lean towards the Ford Explorer when they want to buy an SUV, but if I were you, I would consider looking at the Jeep first.  As a consumer, I looked at and test drove both the Jeep and the Ford, and I have to say the Jeep has a much better ride!  So remember, when you're looking for a sport utility vehicle, look at the Jeep first and you won't regret it!<br><br>
