            I have decided on buying a Toyota Avalon, after seriously researching at different sites, including Epinions,Consumersguide,etc. My system involved first calling a few places with my list of desired features and price, thus narrowing my search down. However, when contacting &quot;DARCARS TOYOTA&quot; in Silver Spring and letting them know the features I wanted and how much I expected to pay for the car, the response I got was exactly the opposite of what I expected: the sales manager was confrontational, told me I &quot;wanted this and that,&quot; and that he had no time for it. He was rude and standoffish. I had expected a welcome to a client who knew what she wanted and was a sure bet to buy with a minimum of wasted time, but he made me change my mind about buying at his car dealership.
Have others (especially women) had a similar experience?
So--love the vehicle, hate the dealer's rude treatment.<br><br>
