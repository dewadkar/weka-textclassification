            Im a mother of three young children in a military family, we travel ALOT!. I traded the comforts of a full size conversion van with all the works for a 2000 Hyundai Accent!!! I was hooked on the warranty alone which includes a great road-side service program free! The thought of breaking down with three screaming kids in traffic terrified me, but no more with my new Accent. 

I even bought the hatch back! The mileage is fabulous!! All three kids still fit in the back with plenty of room to wiggle. As a mother, I couldnt be happier with the basic model I purchased. The interior in the back is so easy to clean! The rear seat and interior as so basic and durable, there is nothing for my children to break during boring road trips! The trunk area still has plenty of room for groceries, soccer balls, and all the other neat things we drag around with us! The rear seat folding down is a nice option when Im buying big items.My husband, who is 6'5'' was comfortable driving it through four states, and the kids in the back didnt die, to their amazement, after their father moved the drivers seat back. 

After driving the van with its big v-8, I was for sure I would get ran over on Missouri's curving up and down roads. No need to worry about that, Ive already got two speeding tickets in it going up hill on the interstate!!  Its easy to drive and turns on a dime! You would be amazed how tight it turns! I can do a u-turn on a two lane road and never come near the shoulder, it definately helps out in the packed parking lots! 

I wish I would have had this car in college!! The price was right and you cant beat the mileage! This car is easy to maintain, easy to service, easy easy easy!Its great owning this car, Hyundai even calls me still to make sure Im happy with it. The customer service is fabulous! This is the perfect &quot;girl&quot; car! You dont have to do anything but have regular oil changes, and if ANYTHING goes wrong, from a dead battery, locked your keys in the car, ran out of gas..Just call the road-side service number and they will find someone to be there in a few minutes, even in my small town!<br><br>
