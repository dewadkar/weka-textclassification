            Mazda has got to be one of the best kept secrets in the automotive world.  Mazda makes great cars.  Sure they may be a little niche-y but given the choice, I�d rather have a Prot�g� than a Civic, or a Millenia S rather than an Accord.  And so it goes with the newest version of the tried and true Miata, given a choice between an Eclipse or a Miata � you guessed it � I�ll take the Miata. 

The recent restyle of the Miata gave it a little more aggressive look � more like a real sports car.  Critics mocked the early versions as looking too girly and cute, granted the first Miatas are cute, but the still have all the fun of an old MG, with the reliability of a Toyota.

The 2001 Miata is simply the best Miata yet, and that�s how it should be, the newest version of a car should be the best.  No one wants to repeat the near deadly blow given by Ford to the Mustang name when they introduced the Mustang II.  Mazda knows what they have and they ain�t going to fix it if it ain�t broke.

On the road the Miata is noticeably stiffer.  The Miata LS is 16% stiffer than last years model, and 22% more rigid.  This may sound like a lot of jargon, but from behind the wheel, it is obvious what this all means � better handling and little or no cowl shake.  The Miata has a go-cart like feel when cornering. Turn in is quick and sharp. Obviously all this handling prowess comes at the expense of ride comfort, but it is tolerable.  On twisty roads the new Miata feels as surefooted as other sports cars costing double the Miata�s meek entry price of $21,000.  The 5-speed is fun, and throws are short.  Each gear virtually clicks into place. <b>The 2001 Miata adds 15 hp over the 2000 model,  making the total 155.  155 hp in a car this size is plenty.**</b>  On the open highway, drop the shifter from 5th to 4th, squeeze the gas, and just try not to smile � you can�t do it.  Acceleration from a stand still is brisk.  The new VVT system adds power, but it seems to come on all at once.  Despite what the Mazda press release says, around town driving can be a little tedious.  At about 3500 rpm, the Miata�s 1.8L engine surges with what feels like turbo lag, even cars that are turbocharged deliver the power more smoothly than the Miata.  However under anything but light acceleration, the Miata is pure fun.  This is a true sports car � an Alfa Spyder or Fiat 124 for the 21st Century.

Inside, the Miata has a few shortcomings. One downside for this car is noise, even when the soft top is up.  The top is very thin and plenty of wind and road noise find its way to your ears,  opt for the removable hard top if this is to be your main mode of transportation.  Once the top is down, and why wouldn�t it be, a wind baffle helps to keep the cabin somewhat free from turbulent wind at the back of ones head.  Also, a serious lack of storage space may have most women scratching their heads when trying to carry a normal sized purse.  The best anyone can hope for is to store 5 or 6 CDs somewhere in the cabin � �you�ll get nothing and like it !� 10 minutes behind the wheel and you'll love it. The return of chrome ringed gauges add a classic touch to a car that is destined to be a true classic.  The red, backlight dashboard is cool looking, without being gimmicky.  Seats are more comfortable than Miatas of years past.  Once a person is use to the sporty seating position, a trip of about 3 hours would be somewhat comfortable, but this is no Lexus.  The usual switchgear is where it belongs, with the main complaint being the tiny heating and ventilation button.  The circular fan switch is so small, a regular sized person must use only the thumb and 1st finger to adjust it.  The stock stereo sounds better than average, but the display is sometimes hard to read.  The center console has been redesigned, and now houses two cup holders, one driver complained that one cup holder was placed exactly where his elbow would normally rest.  It's minor, but this car has gotten so good, the only complaints left are minor.

The Mazda Miata is about fun. It�s not practical, and it doesn�t isolate you from the road like a Toyota might.  The 2001 Miata is probably the perfect 2nd car.  For the price, only the VW GTI comes close to the Miata in the fun-to-drive factor (remember I said �for the price�), but the GTI�s top doesn�t go down � that makes for an easy choice.  Zoom Zoom indeed.

(**155 hp was the published figure from Mazda, they have since said that the new figures were over stated by 8%, this means the real horsepower should be more like 142.5.
If you bought a 2001 Miata, Mazda wants to make it up to you by offering free scheduled maintenance and a $500 debit card to spend on whatever you want.  Check with the dealer, they should know more).
