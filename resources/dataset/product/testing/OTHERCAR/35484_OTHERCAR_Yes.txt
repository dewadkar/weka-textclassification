            My wife and I needed room for our growing family.  We wanted a minivan and Chrysler was our first choice, but the quality concerns made us procrastinate on making a decision until the 99 Odyssey came out.  We really wanted All-Wheel Drive, but Honda's reputation for quality won out.  We live in Wisconsin and had to have a van shipped from a dealer in Kentucky because of the demand.

We loved it immediately.  It is very roomy.  We enjoyed the fact that we were getting a van which we didn't have to remove the third seat.  We underestimated the benefit from that feature.  Not only does the third seat fold flat, but the well that the seat slides into provides a large amount of extra storage space when the seat is in the upright position.  I would bet that this van has more room for moving &quot;stuff&quot; than a Suburban.  It easily beats any other minivan for the amount of space to pack belongings.  

When we go on trips we have my wife and myself, two kids in child seats and three large dogs with room to spare.  We remove one of the middle bucket seats, fold it up and it fits BEHIND the third seat, along with the rest of our belongings for the trip.

The vehicle drives very well. It has excellent power and great brakes.  There is however, too much 'boost' to the power steering.  It takes some time to get used to...

The issues I have with the van are:  
-Power sliding door feature malfunctions often.
-Several small squeaks have developed in sliding doors and tailgate.
-The tailgate flexes at the middle edges over bumps and potholes.
-Door obstruction reverse feature would hurt any child before the sliding door actually reversed.
-Very poor stereo
-No All Wheel Drive - The Traction Control is a poor substitute.

I would recommend this van with the above exceptions.  Hopefully, they are first-year quirks that Honda has ironed out.  However, I would not buy this van again, unless the above problems were addressed and it would absolutely have to have All Wheel Drive.<br><br>
