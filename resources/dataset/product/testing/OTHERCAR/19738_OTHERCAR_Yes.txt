            I've admired the STS for quite a while now, and finally bought one. Everyone makes their point about the handling of this heavy front-wheel drive car, but being that I travel a good bit and live in Iowa, this is about the only luxury car I'd own now.

The power, luxury and handling all make a tremendously nice package that would suit all but the most astute car enthusiasts. I'm not a motorhead, and I have driven Mercedes and Lexus cars, but this is just the complete package... looks, power, feel, front wheel drive and comfort. Nothing else pulled me to it like the STS did.

First gear isn't quite what it could be off the line, but once you hit about 15-20 MPH, it really hits stride. I've blown many a teenager out of the water, but the STS tends to get beaten right out of the gate.

Traveling on highway is really where the power struts its stuff. I can pass a car in no-time, though you do have to be careful with the front wheel drive at high speed acceleration. It likes to jump around a bit as it pulls, so two-hands on the wheel is a must.
