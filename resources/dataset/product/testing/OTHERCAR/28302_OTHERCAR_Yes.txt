            I've had an Elph2 APS camera for years, so when I decided to go digital, the Digital Elph line was a logical choice. I looked at the offerings from Sony, Minolta, and others, before deciding on the S230.

I'm not going to list every feature here, there's plenty of info on Canon's website, and right here on Epinions.

PROS
***********
I really like the size of this camera. It's small (and thin) enough to fit comfortably in my pocket, which allows me to carry it with me most of the time. This has caused me to take many more pictures than I would with a larger camera, since a camera is no good if it's sitting at home. The offerings from Sony and Minolta that I looked at were fairly small, but both were too thick for my taste.

I also love the fact that the S230 has some very advanced features for such a small camera. It doesn't skimp on features just because it's small. Some of the advanced features I really like:

* iSAPS technology for great pictures! The auto white balance and auto focus do a good job of setting up the picture.

* 9-point auto focus. The auto focus does a good job, even if the subject is not in the center of the picture. It even works good if there are multiple subjects.

* Great movie mode. You can take movies up to 3-minutes long (better have a large CompactFlash card!), and the picture and sound quality is great! I usually pack the RCA and USB cables when I'm visiting friends or on a road trip. This allows me to plug the camera directly into most TVs or VCRs and view the movies (and pictures) on the TV. I was surprised how well the camera picked up the sound for such a small device.

* Plenty of manual settings. Sure, you can set everything to auto, and that usually works fine. But, it's nice to have the option of manually adjusting the settings for when you want to get the "perfect" shot. There's even a white balance historgram for more advanced users!

* 3.2 megapixels. For MOST users, this is more than enough. I've made beautiful 5x7 (and even nice 8x10) prints from this camera. In all my life, regardless of camera (I have 35mm SLR's, APS, and Digital), I have NEVER blown a photo up to poster size. Therefore, I DO NOT need a 5 megapixel camera!

* Orientation sensor. If you take a shot with the camera rotated vertically, the orientation sensor somehow knows this, and shows the pic right side up (instead of on its side) when viewing in the LCD screen or after downloading to the computer.

CONS
*************
* This camera has a very weak flash. If you're going to be taking pictures in low light that aren't within 10-12 feet or so, you may need an external light source or flash.

* Terrible redeye reduction. The redeye reduction doesn't work well at all, and if you have it in redeye mode, there's a very long delay from when you press the shutter and when it actually takes the picture. I leave redeye off all the time, then fix the pictures in Photoshop. (Photoshop Elements has an auto-redeye remover tool that works great. Not bad for a $99 product!)

FINAL THOUGHTS
**********************
This is a great all-around camera for weekend warriors. The size is perfect for carrying in your pocket. You should invest in a large (at least 256MB) CompactFlash card.
