            The Monte Carlo is sleek and sporty in appearance, yet large enough to carry the entire family in comfort. The interior has plenty of leg room in the back for the tallest basketball player in the family, yet is small enough that the petite lady of the house is comfortable behind the wheel. The Monte Carlo comes fully equipped with all the goodies that you would normally expect in a much more expensive model, yet fits the pocketbook of the average wage earner. The ride is pure comfort and very quiet. It handles very well both on the open highway as well as the curves through the mountains. I bought the Monte Carlo for my wife who, because of a disability, was no longer able to get in and out of her 1998 Camaro Z28. The Monte Carlo is very easy to get in and out of. She is impressed with how the car handles as compared to her Camaro. The 4-wheel ABS system makes this one of the safest vehicles on the road today.<br><br>
