            This has been a great pickup.  I have the V8 Quad cab with the short bed.  It gets 17 miles to the gallon in the city and 19 miles to the gallon on the highway.  Which I believe is about the same as the dealer said it would get when I bought it.  

I decided on the light driftwood color, which is a very shiny silvery tan.  It doesn't show dirt which is nice.  The paint job has been pretty good, the truck is two years old and still looks brand new.

The Quad cab feature makes it a whole lot easier to load things in your back seat, including people, but if you are tall, their isn't a lot of leg room in the back.  Also, the back seat is a little hard, but its not so uncomfortable you wouldn't want to travel in it.  The ride is fairly smooth, especially in the front seat.  Also the cab is pretty quiet, you hear a little bit of wind noise, but it isn't bad.

I haven't had any problems with this truck except that the power steering has had to be fixed twice this year and my breaks are going out.  To be honest, I've had problems with the brakes.  Sometimes, when you break it is choppy, like you aren't breaking completely.  Some of my friends have complained about this same thing and they have similar truck make and models.

My Dodge has quite a bit of towing power, even though it is only a V8, not the V10.  I have no trouble pulling my camp trailer.

All in all, I have been pretty satisfied with the purchase.  My only complaint is the brakes.  I would recommend a Dodge truck to just about anyone.  It has been a lot nicer than any Ford truck I have owned.  

I would also like to mention that the heater and air conditioner are perfect, and since I live in Nevada it is important to have fully functioning air conditioning.  It cools off and warms up like a breeze.<br><br>
