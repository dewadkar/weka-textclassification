               This newly designed 2001 Sebring convertible has style and comfort in mind.  I was first looking at the Ford Mustang and decided on the Sebring.  The Sebring has much more bang for the buck.  You can seat four adults comfortably and the car is not much larger.  The trunk is very spacious (for a convertible), so you can pack up for the beach and not worry about leaving the top down.  

   I love the leather seats.  They are very easy to keep clean and very durable.  The wood trim looks good but I find it's easy to scratch so you need to be careful what you�re using to clean it with.  The stereo and all accessories are very easy to access.  The cluster is easy to see during the day (white) and at night (blue light).  The Driver side floor mat has a hook to keep it in place (every car should have that).  

   The engine has been boosted up to 200hp 2.7 litre 24 valve engine.  That�s plenty of power for this car.  The engine feels tight and the passing gear really kicks when you want it to.  Front wheel drive is also another plus.  I have to drive this in the winter.

   I'm a younger guy and a lot of people told me that this car was for an older person, but I have to disagree.  This car has lots of feature compared to other convertibles out there, in this price range.  
 
   The only complaints I have are, the top is a little hard to clamp down (they told me that this would get worked in), and that the paint colour I chose (blue) shows scratches easy.
