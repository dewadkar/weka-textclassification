            I have been the happy owner of a 98 Forester L since June of 97. Now our little beast has 50 K on the odometer and it is still a joy to own and drive. But there have been problems and this is where Subaru has really made the ownership experience a joy.
My wife and I bought our Forester new in June, 97. We were actually looking to buy a Suzuki but one look and test drive with the Forester made us believers. So what do we like?
1. Handles like a car. Unlike most other sport utilities the Forester corners and rides like a car with little tendency to roll. It is firm on the road and not at all harsh riding. It is not a &quot;Woods bashing machine&quot; but I doubt that most SUV owners actually do go crashing around in the wilderness.
2. Lots of power, yet reasonable on fuel. The Forester has more than enough power for it's size yet it doesn't guzzle like a Lincoln Navigator. We tried the Honda and Toyota and Suzuki. The Forester had a much better feel, more power and in our opinion a better fit and finish. It easily handles a 2,000 lb trailer, unlike the Rav 4 or the Honda CRV. It also has power to pass and climb, something lacking in the Suzuki Sidekick.
3. Easy to get in to. Unlike many SUV's the Forester has a low entry  point, so it is very much like getting into a car or wagon. No jumping up to hop in to the seat. Yet it still has plenty of ground clearance.
After 2 1/2 years and 50 k we still like our Forester. The problems we have had stemmed from getting one of the first off the production line. We have had some engine work done to get rid of a rather noisy start up slapping sound and some brake and hardware work. But unlike other vehicles I have owned, Subaru suggested the changes and happily covered all costs and provided us with a loaner. The end result was a better product and a lasting fan and customer. All in all I would recommend the Forester to anyone who wants the SUV look and feel, while still wanting the comfort of a car. It is a very stable reliable car, great in snow and casual off road use and very safe feeling to boot. This SUV is a 10.<br><br>
