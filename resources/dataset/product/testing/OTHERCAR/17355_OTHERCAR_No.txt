            I owned a 1995 4 cylinder Accord LX and wanted to step up to something a little more plush, so I purchased a 2001 EX V6. After reading a lot of good press, I didn't put that much time into my shopping, having been very satisfied with my last Honda. First, let me say that I am mostly happy with my car. Honda deserves its reputation for building car with tasteful asthetics and high quality. While not stunningly attractive, I think Hondas look good over time, and I usually keep a car for a while.

It was almost 100 degrees outside when I was test drove the Accord, and it was just not possible to drive without the A/C for more than a couple of minutes. Unfortunately, this hid the fact that the Accord is not a very quiet car. The V6 makes quite a bit of strained noise during even moderate acceleration. Perhaps even more disappointing is the amount of wind noise at highway speeds, and if there are buffeting side winds, get ready for some howling.

The whole driving experience is a little numb compared to that of my last Accord, and the V6 does not feel much more powerful than the old 4. The transmission is also less refined than I expected, with terrible management of the 1st/2nd gear transition. At times the first gear almost seems optional, as the car shifts *immediately* to second gear under light acceleration. Pressing a little harder forces the car to remain in first gear too long, and I sometimes let off the gas a little just to get it to shift. This contributes to the perception of a noisy engine. Furthermore, when I slow to around 5 mph to take a turn, or when a red light turns green before I come to a complete stop, the transmission usually shifts quite roughly as I resume acceleration. It doesn't seem to know which gear to select.

The verdict? I still think it is a well built car that will give me little trouble over the years, but I guess I was hoping for a little more.
