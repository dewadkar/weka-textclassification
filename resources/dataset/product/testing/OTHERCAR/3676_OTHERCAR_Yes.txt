            I'm still trying to get over the fact that this van has a big, ugly, pointy nose...BUT I love this van.  We bought this van because we were outgrowing our 4 door sedan.  A friend of our had this van.  We rode in theirs several times and really liked it.  The features that attracted us are still our favorite.  The power sliding door and the modular seating.  In our 4 years of owning this van we have had NO problems with the power sliding door.  We have replaced batteries in the remotes twice...and one remote even stopped working.  I carry the working remote since I drive the van most of the time.

This van has lots of power!  I have taken advantage of this several times.  We have taken 4 long vacations in it.  We have had no problem towing a trailer either (we had an after market class 2 hitch put on.)  We have found the gas mileage to be EXCELLENT on the freeway, even with running the air conditioner (and a topper and towing a trailer!)  We have averaged around 30 mpg in strict freeway driving.  It runs closer to 20 mpg in our combined city and freeway mileage.

We find the van roomy and comfortable with our family of 4.  We have used it with the seats in varying positions.  This van has 3 seats across the middle and 2 in the back.  We take the back seats out for storage on trips.  Around town I keep the back seats folded up and I still have plenty of room for groceries, stroller, and bags.  A few times we have removed all the modular seats for LOTS of room to move big items.    

We have had several trips to the shop this year, but that is for maintenance we expected.  We have gotten new tires, brakes, and a main belt.  None gave out..we just knew it was time to replace them.  Recently the pulley blew off the water pump, but I was able to get it off the freeway and safety before losing too much power.  We also had a gasket replaced on the exhaust system.  This van is reliable and I feel safe driving the kids and myself around in it!

Complaints include the lack air circulation in back.  There is a fan in back, but we live in a hot climate (traction was great when we lived in a northern climate...no problems on snow!) and it just doesn't get the cool to the back.  The air actually gets too cold up front and we often turn the cold up.  The support inside the headrests on the front pieces fell apart.  I just fixed it myself.

We plan on keeping this van for 3-5 more years.  We plan on replacing it with a NEW Olds Silhouette...one decked out with climate control for the whole van and TV/VCR!!  We bought this van new but I would recommend it as a reliable used purchase also.  Just look beyond the UGLY exterior!  This van would be great for a family with young kids or others looking for power in a minivan with great storage and towing capacity!<br><br>
