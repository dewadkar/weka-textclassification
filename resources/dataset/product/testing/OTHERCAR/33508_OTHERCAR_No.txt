            I wanted to buy a Christmas present for my aunt who loves to take snapshots.  My aunt has been using a point-and-shoot film camera, and rarely makes prints larger than 4x6.  So I wanted to buy a camera that was easy for her to use, while she enjoys the flexibility of digital pictures.

I decided to buy the <i><b>Fuji Finepix A205</b></i> because I found a really good deal from Amazon.com.  About $132.00 shipped, with a free 64 MB x-D memory card.  Wow!  Although I'd been expecting to spend around $200.00, this seemed like such a great deal and I couldn't pass it up.

<b>Exterior:</b>

The buttons on the top are pretty self-explanatory &#150 power-button, take pictures, view pictures, and record movies.  And the buttons on the back of the camera for viewing pictures and accessing the menus are simple and easy to use.

The <i><b>Fuji Finepix A205</b></i> has a nice 3x optical zoom, which is great.  However, I didn&#146t like how it works: it&#146s operated by a horizontal lever that you push down or pull up with your thumb to operate the zoom, which feels awkward.  And it&#146s a &#147step&#148 zoom, so it stops at designated intervals, instead of a fluid movement.

The camera itself is made of silver-colored plastic.  And it feels somewhat cheap compared to the high-impact plastic or metal exterior of pricier cameras.  However, the <i><b>Fuji Finepix A205</b></i> is not flimsy and still pretty durable, and should not be harmed by regular impact or friction.

I've also found the camera to be quite thick.  It doesn't make it difficult to use, and it doesn't look bad, but it sure is chunky compared to most other digital cameras.  You would never describe this camera as "sleek" or "compact."

<b>Power & Memory:</b>

The <i><b>Fuji Finepix A205</b></i> uses two regular AA batteries.  You can use standard alkaline batteries (two are enclosed), or Nickel-Metal-Hydride rechargeable batteries which will last longer.

The <i><b>Fuji Finepix A205</b></i> uses an x-D card, which doesn&#146t seem to be used as widely used as the compact flash or SD format.  (As far as I know, only Olympus and Fuji cameras use the x-D format.)  Compatibility is a good thing, and I was sad to find that the x-D card was not compatible with a multi-card reader I was using.  However, the x-D card isn&#146t a huge obstacle to enjoying this camera, because most of the newer external card readers now accommodate this format.

The x-D card is also a really tiny card.  Small is good when it comes to portable electronics, but an x-D card is so small that it&#146s hard to handle and easy to misplace.

<b>Taking Pictures!</b>

I was very pleased with the picture quality of the <i><b>Fuji Finepix A205</b></i>.  I&#146ve compared 4x6 prints I took with the <i><b>Fuji Finepix A205</b></i> using the highest resolution (1600 x 1200) with 4x6 prints I took with a Canon PowerShot s230, and developed at my local photo shop.  Comparing the two sets of pictures, I found the Fuji shots to have great color, sharpness, and clarity.  The best results were for pictures taken outdoors in the daylight.  For night time indoor shots with flash, I found that the color was a little washed out in the Fuji prints compared to the Canon prints, but they still looked pretty good.

<b>Now, the Bad Stuff:</b>

Probably the biggest functional drawback of this camera is the low-resolution LCD screen.  The LCD screen is of such low quality that most of the time, I&#146m unable to tell whether the picture I just took is in focus or not.  The ability to quickly see the picture you just took, and having the choice to retake it, is one of the basic benefits of digital photography.

Also, there seems to be no battery life indicator.  The camera will alert you when the battery is low, but there is no way to check of the status of the battery life.

<b>Conclusion:</b>

The <i><b>Fuji Finepix A205</b></i> is an okay low-cost option for those who really don&#146t need the fancier functions of digital cameras, such as the ability to manually adjust shots.  If all you want are some decent quality 4x6 snapshots or some pictures for web-use, the <i><b>Fuji Finepix A205</b></i> will do: quite simply, it takes pretty good pictures.

But the poor quality of the LCD screen really detracts from one of the fundamental advantages of digital photography, which is the ability to confirm whether you just took a good, in-focus picture.

Although I was thrilled by the great low price, in the end, I decided to get another digital camera.  I feel a little weird not recommending a <i>camera</i> that takes <i>good pictures</i> (what else is a camera for?), but in the end, I just felt that I could do better with my money than the <i><b>Fuji Finepix A205</b></i>.
