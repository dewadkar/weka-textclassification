            The four door Saturn SL2 was redesigned for 1997 and has enough toys and dependability to keep parents happy while being roomy enough for a growing family.

<B>Choosing The Car</b>

Our family did an enormous amount of research before choosing this car.  Safety was our chief concern and an accident in early 2001 proved to be a mere inconvenience, not a tragedy because of that research.  The car sustained over five thousand dollars worth of damage from a side impact at speed in an intersection; an impact so severe that the fiberglass and plastic doors were shattered, littering the road.  What impressed me most, given that I was driving alone at the time, was that <B>the entire safety cage</b> maintained its integrity.  I was out of the car, shaken but not injured, within a minute.  That�s after the impact and a 180-degree spin into a median.  A co-worker following behind me pulled over and said I was shaken, but lucid.  

Nothing else you�ll read about this car is as important as me walking away from that accident without a scratch.  We purchased this car with slightly higher mileage because of its 1997 redesign.  Good choice.

<B>Other Features</b>

Since its initial test drive, the car has driven smoothly with one minor transmission problem.  We chose a five speed manual transmission as opposed to the wimpier automatic to make the car appear peppier, and there is something fun about downshifting in a little four cylinder with no power.  

The car has always handled well, and if its turning radius isn�t as tight as I might like, the car corners well and the steering is fine.  

An optional electric sunroof lets the wind whip in while the sound system doesn't require a NASA scientist to help program. And did I mention the four doors?  Unfortunately, power locks are optional and guess whose children never lock their doors? Still, the backseat is roomy enough to fit a 6' tall teenager and his two brothers so the complaint is minor.  There are also children safety locks on the rear doors, preventing little hands from opening the door from the inside.  Think of the back seat of a police car.  We no longer use them, but they were a nice feature when our youngest was younger.

Gas mileage is average for this sedan type; we're typically seeing 30 mpg on the highway and in the low-to-mid 20s in local driving. One alarming feature is the gas gauge itself. For some reason � perhaps a bad gas tank float - the first half tank zips by in 80-100 miles. We typically get another 150 or so in the second half tank without running the gauge down to low to avoid stirring up silt.

Since buying this Saturn 18 months ago, we've had virtually no repairs bills. A few oil changes and one unfortunate tug of war with a seat belt harness that was most definitely pilot error and not the vehicle's fault make up the extent of our mechanical problems.  For a family of five, that kind of dependability is worth its weight in gold. 

So, dependable and roomy, cost-efficient as all get out and a nice smooth ride. What's not to like? Saturn has earned a repeat purchase from me the next time we're ready to buy a new car.
