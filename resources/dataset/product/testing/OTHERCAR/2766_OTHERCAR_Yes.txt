            I bought my Jetta in mid 1998.  I bought this car because it looked sporty and it was cheap.  I bought it used with 8,000 miles on it.  The person before me bought the car and took the bike and the owners manual:(

The car is not the most comfortable car in the world, but I have had no problems with the car after owning it for 2 years.  Not once have I had to take it into the shop for anything. 

This car is fast and reliable.  I would only recommend the 5 speed for the 4cyl model.  The 4cyl is peppy for 115 HP.  This car rides as good as the BMW 318is I used to drive.  I am most impressed with the A/C in this car.  I live in Texas and I have never driven a car with A/C as powerful as this car.  It will freeze your hands!

The car drives like a rock.  You feel every crack in the road and can be confident in taking corners at high speeds.  I also like how it handles in the rain -- it really holds the road, which is rare for a car of this size.

If you like a true driver's car at a good price this car is for you.  VW is really making waves.
