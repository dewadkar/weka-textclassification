            A friend of mine first introduced me to this camera a few weeks before we were expecting our triplets.  He had purchased the camera for his business, which I am part of.  We had used to camera for products for our website.  I, being responsible for the website, had only had experience downloading the pictures to the computer and then editing them.  The download always went great and the pictures were easily editable and always showed a great amount of detail.

I borrowed the camera, having never used a digital camera before.  We took some shots of my two older boys and our niece and nephew.  This camera made for an easy transition from using a 35mm to a digital camera.  Needless to say, there are 100�s and 100�s of photo�s of my children now.

I have since �convinced� my friend to sell me that camera.  We are still snapping photos every chance we get.  I think the kids wish they had never seen a camera.  :-)

<B>What You <I>Should</I> Know</B>

What you should know first off about this camera is that it definitely <B>does</b> have a zoom on it, contrary to what the <I>Epinion</I> Spec Sheet shows about it.  It also says that the estimated price for the camera is <I>under $100.00</I>.  I wish it was, but they actually run for about $329.00 on the Internet now.

What I liked most about the <I>D-490Z</I>:

<b>o</b>  <I>Very</I> easy to use - great for a first time digital camera user

<b>o</b>  Great quality photographs - there are 4 settings on the camera for �quality� of photographs.  The �high� quality is very well defined and allows for easy editing.

<b>o</b>  The zoom on the camera is superb.  You can zoom in on your subject before taking the photo, or take the photo and then zoom in on the photo using the LCD on the back of the camera.  

<b>o</b>  The LCD is very easy to see.  I have had experience with LCD screens on still and video cameras.  I have seen some that have major degradation on the screen and others that are very hard to see in bright light.  This LCD was easy to see even when outside taking photos of the kids.

<b>o</b>  Very lightweight and small - This was very important to me, being that I had 3 carriers and babies to carry around.  After having the triplets, our hands are definitely full when we are out and about.  I can stuff the camera into my pocket or clip it on my belt when it�s in the carrying case.  Some cameras that I�ve looked at would definitely not be suitable for this.  They would definitely have my pants pulled down around my ankles.  We definitely <B>cannot</b> have that happening.

<b>o</b>  It also has a video function on the camera which allows you to use the camera as a video camera for up to 60 seconds of filming.  It�s not quite as fast and accurate as a video camera, but I was definitely impressed.  It uses <I>QuickTime</I> format and files at 15 frames per second.  

<b>o</b>  Software is easy to use and easy to install.  The <I>Olympus Digital Vision</I> was very easy to install and came right up looking for the camera and gave thumbnails of all the photos on the SmartCard.   


<b>What You <I>Shouldn�t</I> Know</b>

You definitely should not know how many batteries you are going to have to buy for this camera.  I was amazed at how fast it sucked the life from the batteries.  You can either use the dual AA batteries from Olympus (approx $35.00).  You need two of those by the way.  You can also use 4 AA batteries.  The two Olympus batteries do seem to last a little longer, but not to justify the $70.00 that you are going to pay for them.  I will continue to purchase my family packs of Duracell�s.  

I have, however, figured out that if you take the digital photos by looking through the lens, instead of using the LCD screen on the back, you will save enormous amounts of battery life.  I only turn on the LCD when I absolutely have to.  This has not been a hindrance and has saved by many dollars in batteries.  

The flash has to be flipped up in order to use it.  This can be annoying for us <I>�forgetful�</I> males are using the camera.  My wife always seems to remember to flip it up before using it in the house.  I can never remember and it causes me to have to retake after I realize I can�t make out the figures in the photo.  Not a flaw, but definitely an annoyance.  

8 MB SmartMedia card is included with the camera.  This will work for you for a while, but as you get more proficient with the camera and start utilizing the video feature and the high quality photographs, you will need to upgrade the card.  You can get SmartMedia cards at an all time low right now.  I have a 64 MB Card in mine, and it has been more than enough.  

The cable that comes with the camera is a Serial cable.  USB would have been <I>very</I> nice and a whole lot faster.  You can however get an adapter that will convert this to USB.  You still will not get the full speed of straight USB, but it does help.

<b>Summary</b>

This is an extremely easy camera to use and adjust to.  I believe that if you are shopping for your first digital camera, you�ve found it.  This one will teach you all the ins and outs of using a digital camera.

There are many digital cameras on the market today.  You will find many with more features, higher resolution, and much bigger price tags.  For the money, you are definitely getting a superb camera in the <B>D-490Z</b>.
