            I bought my 1993 Toyota Camery four years ago at this used car lot not too far from my house.  I had a 3 cylender Chevy GEO Metro that was on its last leg and was in need of a car that was bigger and more dependable.  I had heard about Camery's from many people who had said that they were one of the best cars around so I looked into it and decided that that was the car I was going to buy.  I had never even seen one or been in one so when I went to this car lot and saw a silver one I thought I would get in it and take it for a ride.  I had my friend with me who has experience buying cars.  I fell in love with it the moment I sat in it!  It drove so smooth and was so much roomier than what I had been used to.  And it was also so quiet!! I didnt want to look any farther! I got it immediatly.  

I have not been at all disapointed in it in all of the four years I have had it.  The only thing I have had to get fixed on it are the brakes but that is from everyday wear and tear.  I think its a great car and hope I have it for another 4 years or more!<br><br>
