            When the late 80's / early 90's rolled around, Pontiac was in an identity crisis.  Were they a low-cost &quot;loss leader&quot; like Chevy, a sporty in-between sandwiched between Chevrolet and the upper reaches of Buick and Olds or just what???

The Grand Am, a luxurious muscle car of the mid 70's, made a came back as an anemic sedan in the mid 80's.  It even looked, boring!  Then Pontiac rounded the corners, softened the edges and added some spirit to its lineup.

The model reviewed is a 1992 four door with an Olds designed Quad 4 engine.

<b>ENGINE</b> The Quad Four 4 cylinder engine has the power and thirst for fuel as a V6.  It's a little noisy under hard acceleration but it is fun to drive, at least from the power standpoint.

<b>RIDE</b> Harsh?  Well it's not that bad but sometimes it feels like the car is splitting in half when you hit a bump.  I think that it's the sporty stiff suspension.  In a &quot;touring sedan&quot; (if it fits in that category), the ride should be a little softer.  

<b>COMFORT</b> Nicely designed cockpit.  Many controls are at fingertip reach.  Do not like the &quot;bolsters&quot; on the front seats.  These keep your hips and butt from sliding.  Don't think that you'll pull enough 'G's' to need them and they hurt if your hips aren't the right size.  This is not a 600 horsepower American-LeMans Sports car, regular buckets would have been fine.  Rear seating is not bad, but the angle of the rear doors makes it a twist to get out of and it's a 4 door!

<b>BUGABOOS</b> Bad paint, fit and finish have haunted many GM cars from the 80's and 90's.  This one was repainted free out of warranty.  Lots of electrical problems (Power door locks, locking at inopportune time, taillight wiring draining battery, ignition switch and so on).

In summary, Pontiac wanted a sporty car.  It looks the part but it is just above average basic transport.  Please have everything electrical checked if buying one used.<br><br>
