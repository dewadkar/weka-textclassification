            I have always been rather turned off by SUV's...they seem overlarge, difficult to maneuver, and a true pain in parking lots.  I never have thought I would like driving an SUV, nor could I ever imagine my petite mother trying to manage such a bulky vehicle.  So I was very surprised when my mom decided to buy the Subaru Forester.

After taking a test spin and testing out all the cool features, I found the Subaru to be truly built to accommodate a woman.  The seating proportions are just right, and the steering, accelerator, and brakes respond very well.  The ride is impeccably smooth, and while the Forester is a rather small SUV, it doesn't have the sickening go-cart feel of other smaller vehicles. My mom's main comment was: &quot;this car feels more like an extension of my body than a machine.&quot;

While not as roomy as a minivan or other SUV's, the Forester has enough room to comfortably seat a family of five (there's even a headrest in the middle back seat!), as well as to cart around a ton of gear.  The doors and back hatch are very easy to open, even by short or weak (such as myself) people.  I really like how easy it is to move the seats for added space...it was such a hassle with our minivan.

Lots of extra goodies make the Forester fun as well as practical. A wonderful moonroof extends over both the front and back seats, which adds a surprising feel of lightness and airiness to the car.  We opted for the new side airbags as well, which on top of the other safety features adds up to a pretty secure vehicle.  Everywhere I look there are little places to put things, including a great flip-down door in the front for sunglasses.  What really beats all though are the heated seats.  I've never been in a car with those before...and since it gets really chilly here they really can make a difference.  Turn on the butt-warmers mom!

I honestly believe that if women were surveyed to see what features they would most want in an SUV designed for them, the Subaru would fit the bill.  Safety, proportion, sleek design, fun features...the Forester has it all.
