            The first new car my husband and I purchased in the last 10 years was the 1999 Nissan Maxima.  We wanted a reliable car that would not be in the shop every other week like some of the other cars we have had over the years.  We own a 1986 Jaguar, need I say more.

The Maxima has been everything that we hoped it would be.  The interior is roomy, the seats are comfortable and the car handles well, like a Jaguar, fast and quick, while able to make the sharpest turns without any problems what so ever.

The interior has all the features, with bucket seats, leather rapped steering wheel, 8 speaker stereo, power seats, windows, doors locks, and sun roof. In the back, 3 adults can sit comfortably in the back seats  You can fold down one of the back seats too.   This is useful for carrying large and long items.   We fold down the seats when we get firewood.

Because there is a 3 year warrantee and maintenance contract, we have taken the car back to the dealer for minor checkups. Oil change mostly.  After the 3 years have expired, we have an independent auto shop we like to go to because that is usually when the dealer try to make a killing off your ignorance.

We have had this car for a year now and I would highly recommend the Nissan Maxima to all my friends.
