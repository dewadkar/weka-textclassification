            As parents of a newborn who owned a Ford Escort,we learned quickly that a 2 door car just wasn't going to be good.We purchased our cutlass,with much reluctance on my part.I thought it was too big for me to handle.I quickly changed my mind:this 6 cylinder vehicle is powerful whether in snow or normal conditions,it is comfortable to ride in with its plush seats-good for long car trips.It offers an extremely large trunk-great for all the baby gear we haul,although if the things shift in the trunk while driving and end up way back,you will have a hard time getting them out if you are short like me.This car gets excellent gas mileage,although not as great as the smaller cars.

A friend of mine asked what it was like to drive this car and I told her that it had the power of a smaller truck and it felt like you were sitting in an overstuffed couch on wheels.The only problem is,with the heat on and those seats,I get a little too comfortable sometimes and don't want to get out!lol.
