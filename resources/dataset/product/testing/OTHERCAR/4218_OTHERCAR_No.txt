            I bought my 1996 Caravan to replace my 1988 Voyager which had many mechanical problems.  I was told Chrysler had redesigned the transmission on the new mini-vans, so I decided to buy one.  What a mistake!  Again, I had to replace the tranny and two axles at a cost of over $3000 during the first 60,000 miles.  Then at 82,000 miles I was told the front axle had to be replaced again.  

From the first day I bought the car, the windshield wipers would mysteriously run then stop on its own.  I never knew when it was going to happen.  My family and I just thought there was a little gremlin inside the engine playing jokes on us.  The van had a great comfortable ride, but i couldn't afford the repairs on it.  I decided not to keep it and still feel sorry for the poor person who now owns it.  I have owned three Chryslers during my 26 years of driving and have had major mechanical problems with all three of them.  I will never buy another Chrysler product again and don't mind sharing my opinion with anyone.  <br><br>
