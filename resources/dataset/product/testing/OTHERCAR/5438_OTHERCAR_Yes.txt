            Unlike others on here, I have been driving my car for a few thousand miles so my review may be more helpful.

I researched cars for quite some time before driving off the lot with my new Elantra.  No other car out there can match safe features and standard features...plus you gotta love that warranty.

All new Elantra model cars come with the same engine (2.0 liter 140HP engine) with may seem a little weak but push those RPM's up and it starts to show that 140HP.  This is one of those RPM engines so in order to get that extra power you must run engine a little harder. Most power can be found in the 4500-6000 RPM range. (Redlines at 6500)  My car came home with a 5-speed which seems a little more fun to drive than the automatic.

The inside and outside of this car look like a $20k car...you may be shocked at the initial quality.  I usually don't care about audio systems but the CD stereo has a 6-speaker sound system with a little more power then the standard system. (100 watts) The factory speakers are quite sensitive so even though the wattage is low it sounds nice.  

The down....

During a test drive we are on the lot when?....during the day of course!  That means that we never really see how the headlights perform and the Elantra headlights just seem dark and low.

Don't follow anyone on the highway because the paint is VERY thin scrapes and chips show up all over the place.  (I have to get the side trim replaced due to a shopping cart that scrapped off all the paint with a light hit.)

Inside-

When new the car was shhhh quiet but now some miles later new squeaks and rattles have sprung up..I'm gonna try out that super warranty so that should fix those issues.

Overall...

I love this car!  Price and features match no other!  At least test drive it before writing it off if you are unsure.
