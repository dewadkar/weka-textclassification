            I guess that first I need to say that I'm not a camera expert.  However, the fact that we had a couple of new additions to our family (twin nieces!) made me think about buying a decent camera for all the pictures I knew I would be taking. I have a friend who is quite satisfied with his Fuji DX-10 and, after I saw some of the pictures he had taken, I decided that this was the camera for me.

The Fuji DX-10 is compact and very easy to use.  It has a built-in flash, LCD monitor and live audio output.  I also like the fact that I can just erase my mistakes rather than keep a bunch of imperfect prints.  There was also a serial cable included to connect it to my computer.  I really like the free Adobe software that was included so that I can alter photographs.  This comes in quite handy with some of the gag photos I make for the kids in the family.

For a person who is not really a pro at photography, I am becoming quite good at taking and editing my photographs.  This is the camera for those who just want to point and click and couldn't care less about all the technical stuff.

I purchased this camera for $260 at a local camera shop but am sure I could have gotten a better deal at some of the larger chains.  However, I got lots of tips from the clerk on exactly how to operate the camera that made it worth the few extra dollars.
