            I bought the Daewoo Leganza because of the price and features of the car.  Leather seats, cd player, professional look were important in my car purchase decision.  I basically have been very happy with the vehicle and am especially happy with the service I receive from the South Philadelphia dealership from which I purchased the vehicle. 

Pros: 
1. Great price
2. Great warranty
3. Great customer service

Cons:
1. Poor heating, it simply does not warm up quick enough, nor warm enough. 
2. Poor defrost time.  It takes forever to defrost the windows.
3. A V6 option might be needed, pickup is decent, but could use a little more power.
