            This vehicle fits that saying of &quot;when boys get older, their toys get more expensive&quot;.  I'm not a huge fan of this vehicle but my husband loves it!  He loves it for these reasons:  it's fun to drive, it handles well, ok gas mileage as far as SUV's go, relatively inexpensive to buy, drive and maintain, reliable, and above all, it's just so &quot;cool&quot; especially with the top down.  The only thing he complains about is virtually no trunk space with the back seat in.  
I don't like it for several reasons:  
1.  It's extremely loud (virtually impossible to carry on deep conversations - or any conversations for that matter - when you're on the road).  It's definitely not designed for long road trips, especially on the highway.  
2.  It's cold in the winter and while it heats up quickly there's still lots of cold drafts
3.  It's definitely not a practical family vehicle.  Try getting in and out of that thing when you're 9 months pregnant!  (I won't mention that our 8 month old son loves riding in it because he can actually see out the large plastic windows).  There's only comfortable seating for 4 adults or 3 adults and 1 car seat.  No room for the in-laws.  Even picking up a couple people and their luggage from the airport can be a tight squeeze.
4.  I find it's difficult to see out of those plastic windows when driving, especially the rear one, especially during a rain or if the vehicle hasn't been washed recently.  I'll take glass windows over plastic ones anyday.
5.  I find there's a huge blind-spot and to do shoulder checks I need to do alot of manuvering to see past the support beams.  Check this out when you test drive it.
6.  If you've never driven a SUV, they have a high center of gravity and can tip quite easily.  I discovered this while dodging a bale of hay in the middle of the freeway (only in Texas) and almost tipped us.  This may have to do more with the driver than the machine (I'll admit) but take it into consideration.
7.  I do like to cruise in it in the summer on the beach with the top down.  Just one pointer though - don't live in a 3-story walk-up with this vehicle.  Every time you take the top up or down you have to carry two windows up 3 flights of stairs.  Have a garage or place to store the miscellaneous disassembled parts (back seat, hard top etc) if necessary.
Anyway, that's about the extent of my experience with this vehicle.  I think it's a great vehicle for a single guy in a somewhat southern climate.  It would also be a pretty good mid-life crisis type of vehicle, but it's just not happening for practicality.  (anybody want to buy one?)
