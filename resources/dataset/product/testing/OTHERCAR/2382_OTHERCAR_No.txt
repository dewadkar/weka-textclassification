            I've had my Toshiba for about 1 1/2 years now.  I've taken a lot of pics with it in every conceivable light.  For the most part it does what it is suppose to do...take pics.  However, it comes with a manual the size of a novella telling you how to work it.  That's my first complaint.

Next are the cheap parts they added to it.  The crappy plastic lens cover with constantly falls off.  The rubber cover for the battery charger and PC hook-up that a good 30 seconds to match up and close...annoying.  Finally is the sling to carry it around your neck so that you don't break your $700 camera is itchy and useless.  If you really do attach it to the camera the way they intended your new purchase would be hitting the ground very shortly.  I had to sew mine together to keep it safe.

As far as the camera goes...it does horrible in low light even with a flash.  Also, most pics come out blurry that a regular camera would take normal.  For some reason the camera wants you to be perfectly still for every shot.  It is my understanding that Toshiba put out a patch for the light problem, but I have no clue how to do that to fix it.  As far as the other features, I haven't really taken the time to read the book.  I point and shoot and pray for a good pic.

Last but not least and my biggest complaint is that I lost the CD software that came with the camera and had to PAY 20 bucks for the CD and shipping to get a new one because Toshiba doesn't offer a online version or even a freebie replacement.

My next camera will not be a Toshiba, I'll find something else less complicated and better made.  I'm just grateful I was able to get it for under $600.
