            If you are looking for a sedan, and want a reliable, well equipped but fairly priced vehicle with good performance, then the Accord EX V6 might be the one you seek.  I think this is the best car for about $20,000.  I believe Honda builds the best engines in the world for this class of automobile. The look and feel of the plastic is outstanding compared to Camry and Maxima.  I have owned 2 previous Hondas and they have all had very good reliability.   

The engine is smooth and responsive; this car accelerates from 65mph to 85mph easily. The car handles well in all weather conditions, including snow. Interior build quality is excellent. Features included with the EX V6: AC, cruise, Honda security alarm, sunroof, leather, 6 disc CD changer, 8-way driver seat adjust, climate control, automatic transmission, ABS, traction control, air bags, and floor mats!  

The dealers usually jack the MSRP to around 24,000 but you can easily negotiate a cheaper price.  My suggestion is to negotiate &quot;on the road price&quot; which includes taxes, freight and other charges.  Anything above $22,000 &quot;on the road&quot; would be a bad buy.  If you are looking for the Accord SE aim for $19,750 and if you are looking for the LX aim for $21,000.<br><br>
