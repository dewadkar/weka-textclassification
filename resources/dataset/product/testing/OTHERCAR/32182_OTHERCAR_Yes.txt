            This car has been pretty decent so far.  (A much better experience than with my 1990 Nissan Maxima.)  It gets good gas mileage (around 28 MPG) and is a great value.  I bought this car @ 18,000 miles and have approximately 30,000 miles on it.  I replaced the alternator and serpentine belt two days ago. The cost of replacement wasn't too bad after having work done on a Nissan! Other than that, I haven't had many problems.  I don't like the factory pinstripes; I peeled them off.  My car is white and has black bumpers.  I just wish my car was one color!  I have no power accessories (power locks, windows, etc), but that is okay considering I have a base model car.  I'm a small girl, so the size doesn't bother me.  My tall guy friends beg to differ.  One being 6'1" has a bit of trouble getting in and out of the backseat.  If you are overweight or very tall, I wouldn't recommend this car for you.  As far as safety goes, this car comes with both driver and passenger side air bags as well as anti lock brakes.  The seat belts are annoying and get in the way at times.  I like the folding back seat for easy access to the trunk.  The only interior light in my car is the dome light.  My biggest complaint is the horsepower.  I have to shut the air conditioner off when riding up hills or passing people.  It took a while for me to get used to limited options such as the tachometer.  I was used to having the tachometer in my Maxima and then switched to the Cavalier which has no tachometer.  I also wish the glove box locked.
