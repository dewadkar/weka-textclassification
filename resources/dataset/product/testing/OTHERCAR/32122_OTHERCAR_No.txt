            I test drove a Chevy Metro, Hyundai, Kia, and a Daewoo Lanos. I bought the Daewoo Lanos. First, because of price; 10650 minus a 1000 dollar rebate because it was a 99. Second, the warranty; a 5 year 60,000 power train warranty. Third, Daewoo pays for all service requirements for 3 years or 36,000 miles. All I have to do is put in gas for the first 36,000 miles. Oil changes, tune up's wiper washers, brakes, all fluids are free of charge. Fourth, it came with power everything and a anti-theft device, although I paid extra for air conditioning. Last, in my opinion the Lanos SE test drove better than the Metro, Accent, Kia, and Corolla. In the Kia, I ground gears twice during the test drive and I've been driving a stick for 11 years.
I love the price, handling, options, looks, and feel. It drives well in the city and good enough for me on the freeway. It steers well and has plenty of power for a 1.6 engine. Road noise is minimal considering it is a low end car and the ride is good. The seats are very comfortable front and back and there is enough room. I'm 6 feet, 230 pounds and I fit perfectly.
