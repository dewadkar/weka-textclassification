            I love my S4.  I look around to see what would I rather have... Nothing.  Well maybe a Ferrari Modena, new 911 Turbo would be nice.   But if all wheel drive is valuable then your choices are limited.  WRX, BMW 330Xi, a few other... VR4 maybe.  I have had some cars that felt much more positive in the corners, but over all, these days I am looking for.  Fast, safe, fun to drive, interior room, comfortable, makes me feel important.  An S4 meets all my qualifications.  It's stealth.  Silver, tinted windows, and the rest is stock.  

You know I don't need to go 0-60 any faster then 5.8 seconds and what is really important to me is 70-100.  I don't know what the time is but it is good enough.  I have had faster ('93 RX7) but over all practicallity of this car rocks.  The snow with some Pirelli snowsports on the freeway I tell honestly is barely any different then pavement in the summer.  70 mhp jerk the wheel back and forth and it just goes back and forth.  No excitement here.  

I use this car as a truck carry 3*4s, concrete, you name it.  I use it as my race car.  I race down dirt roads sliding on every corner.

Even though the limiter is at 143mph I still managed to get mine to 146.  If someday I feel like going really fast like my RX used to be I will get the chip, but I have had this car 1 year and it meets my needs.  A few minor problems.  Terrible brake dust on the wheels.  A little road noise, but considering how much lighter it is then an A4 I will take the noise.  At 35k miles basically nothing.

Good luck.  The new one will have 344HP and is lighter and stiffer but I still like the 2001-2002 body.  I would really like the additonal back leg room though. Stiffer is good too.
