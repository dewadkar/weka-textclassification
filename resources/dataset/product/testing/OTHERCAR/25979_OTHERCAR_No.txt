            This is not a review of a specific model per se, but rather a conglomeration of many Cavaliers that I have driven over the past several years.  One was a base model sedan with no cruise control that I was forced to take on a long trip.  Another was a convertible that a friend rented when we went to the beach.  Another was a brand new top-of-the-line Z24 coupe owned by another friend.

Despite a price range of 12,000 - 20,000 within the Cavalier model lineup, my impression has always been the same. GM couldn't care less about the design of this car and only sells it to meet their Government mandated fuel economy standards (CAFE) that allows them to sell much more profitable Tahoes and Suburbans.  It's completely unburdened by the engineering process.

The car has two good points I should mention.  The first is that the bigger 150 horsepower engine really is quite powerful and accelerates and car nicely with either transmission.  I think 0 - 60 time with the automatic is under 8 seconds which is great in this class.  The other good point is that the automatic transmission shifts smartly and crisply, and the stick shift is fun to drive, at least when it comes to the performance of the powertrain.

Unfortunately every other aspect of this car is sub-par. The interior especially does not impress.  It's horribly designed in terms of ergonomics, and even $10,000 cars like the Kia Rio and Hyundai Accent use better quality materials.  Hard shiny black plastic everywhere the eye can see.  That would be acceptable 10 years ago, but in todays small car market, when you have much more competent cars like the Ford Focus winning awards for ergonomics, it is pathetic that Chevy doesn't do any better with the interior.

The chassis is an old design, dating back almost 15 years, and you can feel it.  Every bump in the road feels like it goes straight into whatever unlucky hand happens to be holding the steering wheel.  If you take a corner even a little too fast the back end bumps around like it's on hydraulics.  You're not going to find that on a car with an independent rear suspension, but GM probably won't update the car until 2003 or 2004. (and then it will be based on a current European car design, like what Ford did when they brought the Focus to the US).  With the except of my friend's brand new Z24 every Cavalier I have even driven or rode in has had unexplained rattles.  


It's very interesting to me that there are 2 very different definitions of the word "Cavalier".  One is "A gallant or chivalrous man, especially one serving as escort to a woman of high social position; a gentleman. The other is "Showing arrogant or offhand disregard; dismissive".  Somehow the second definition seems more appropriate.
