            I have found my inner child, and he's a thirteen-year-old boy. This is a tremendous discovery for someone's mother to make, if you ask me, but I think it's true. 

The whole thing started because my old Mazda RX-7 needed work. A lot of work. I owned the car outright, but it had reached the age where it was going to take thousands of dollars a couple of times a year to keep it driving anything like I wanted. Despite argument from my significant other, my emotional attachment to the RX-7 -- my first ever fun car -- was such that I really did plan to just keep fixing it again and again, or else replace it with a newer RX-7 if I could find one. 

Well, just as I was about to finally bite the bullet and get major transmission work done on the RX-7, my main squeeze threw me and our two-year-old son in his van, and took me out to a car lot where, side by side, sat a used Corvette and a newer RX-7 turbo. I test drove the RX-7, and found it similar to the one I already had, only with absolutely zero cargo space. I planned to test drive the Vette, but they'd locked the keys in the car. Inspired, though, I headed to the Chevy dealership to see if they had any used Vettes. And they did -- but not in my price range. To my surprise, though, the showroom floor Camaro SS was available at a price I could talk myself into. Giggling a little inside, I took a Camaro SS for a test drive. 

I was surprised by how much I liked it. Tons of zip, enough cargo space to pick up a reasonable load of groceries if I needed to, comfortable seats that were even big enough for my son's car seat... if only I liked the way it looked. I thanked the Chevy dealer for the test drive, and headed up the street to the Pontiac dealer, where I found a bargain: a low-miles, bright red 1995 Trans Am, six-speed with the Hurst shifters, half the price of the new Camaro SS. So I took that one for a ride too.

First of all, I have bad knees. So a few years ago, I came to grips with the notion that I wouldn't be driving stick anymore. It had been years, but it came right back driving that fun car... a little slow stop and start around surface streets, then out onto the highway and next thing I know, there I am in 6th, severely over the speed limit at 1500 rpm. I took the car out of gear, got off the freeway, and went back to the dealership, angel on one shoulder saying &quot;But remember, you can't drive stick anymore, remember your knees shaking in traffic?&quot; and devil on the other saying, &quot;Who cares? Who CARES! This car RULES!&quot; This, like I say, is where the teenage boy comes in.

I looked at every Trans Am on that lot. Unlike the Camaros, they didn't have any automatics in stock. I worked that dealer, had him showing me every little feature of every Trans Am, and then I got back in the aged RX-7 and, responsibly, drove home without buying a stick.

But back at the house, I started my Trans Am research in earnest. I was intrigued to compare Firebirds and Camaros, learning that more Camaros are made than Firebirds, that a larger percentage of women buy Firebirds than Camaros, while the opposite is true of Camaros. I walked around for a few days saying things like &quot;Hey, it's a version of the Corvette engine,&quot; and &quot;I think traction control would be a major plus,&quot; and &quot;Okay, can you explain the difference between gear ratio and axle ratio?&quot;

Just like that, I'd managed to tell myself I could sever my emotional bond with my RX-7, and I knew that I wanted to replace it with a hefty American V8. For a new, sporty car, that meant I had 3 options: Firebird, Camaro, or Mustang. For a slightly used car, a Corvette.

Frankly, I just don't like the looks of the new Mustang at all. And to get the same horsepower that are standard with a Camaro or Firebird, I would have had to spring for a Mustang SVT Cobra, with a higher sticker price than I wanted to pay for a car whose looks I don't like, and which I constantly see lots of on the road anyway. What's more, I fail to see why the absolute top-of-the-line Mustang, the SVT Cobra R, actually gets any play when you could buy a new Corvette for the same price. People actually pick a Mustang over a Vette? Ford must have some advertising whizzes. But naaaah, the Mustang was never a contender for me.

The used Corvette was. However, after a fair amount of contemplation, I decided that what I really wanted to do was buy my first brand-new car, where I got to pick out the colour and everything, and it came with a solid warranty and no miles on it and it would be mine from the very beginning. So, back to Camaro vs. Firebird. 

First of all, the base V6 was right out. I'm sure it's a great car, but after driving the 305-horsepower V8s, I had to have one. I didn't even bother to test-drive the 200-horsepower V6 Firebird or Camaro. If I'd been in the market for a V6, however, either the Camaro or the Firebird would have been a hands-down win over the V6 Mustang, which I've rented and, frankly, enjoyed less than a Camry -- which is too bad, because I wanted to like the Mustang. 

Deciding between the Camaro and Firebird ended up being easier than one might think. While I liked the way the Camaro handled, and its features and options, and while the price was right and there were plenty of Camaro SSes around that were automatic transmission, the bottom line is I liked the looks of the Trans Am better. It took me the better part of a week to find an automatic Trans Am to test drive, to be sure I liked the way the automatic transmission felt. Deep down, the teenage boy inside me kept hollering the whole time: &quot;You don't care! So what about your knees! Get this one! Get it! Get it! Yeah! Don't drive the dying RX-7 off this lot!&quot;

When I finally found one, it was an automatic Trans Am with the WS6 performance package on it, and it was a 2001, which meant I wouldn't be able to take advantage of the $1500 rebate for the 2000 model year, and the bottom line there was that the car was just a little more expensive than I really wanted to pay, for features that I wasn't likely to ever really capitalize on -- 17&quot; wheels, 15 more horses, and the functional scoops with tougher-looking hood, for example.

I ended up picking out an automatic Trans Am to be delivered from about a hundred miles away, with the only options being chromed wheels, traction control, and the &quot;performance axle&quot; with the 3.23 ratio. While the waiting for the car to be delivered was sheer torture, I could not be happier with the vehicle.

First of all, I'm thrilled with its pure oomph. I'm learning to drive all over again -- if I drive this car the way I drove the RX-7, I'm going to get arrested. Step anything but lightly on the accelerator when the light turns green, and the tires will squeal. This car is very quick off the line -- the same kind of driving that would keep me reasonably in step with other cars before now leaves me seeing them far back in the rear-view mirror. Of course, this means I've got to be vigilant if I'm not the first one up at the light. ;-)

Pickup is exceptional, even at highway speeds. This means the car really is terrific in California freeway traffic: if I need to be somewhere else, fast, it's no problem. It's great to have the power to accelerate out of potentially sticky situations even when the overall flow of traffic is already exceeding the speed limit. I'm also very happy with braking (since I don't have downshifting for an added measure of control, in an automatic) and the car's overall responsiveness. Take a week of Silicon Valley driving, and you're guaranteed a few chances to find out how your car reacts to adverse traffic scenarios. 

While I've heard complaints about visibility, I have to say it's superior to what I had in the RX-7. Yes, the rear window is short, so you don't get a tall view of the road there, and that takes some getting used to, as does seeing the rear spoiler in the reflection. However, the side mirrors are excellent, and the glance-over-the-shoulder blind spot is much smaller than the one I had with the RX-7, which was enough of a blind spot to hide an entire Geo Metro (ask me how I learned that one). 

I didn't get the driver's seat with lumbar support, just the basic 6-way power seat. If I were expecting to do nonstop roadtrips, or if I already had back problems, I would likely have opted for the upgraded seat, but I'm perfectly happy with this one, and suspect I would be even for the occasional roadtrip. However, I expect a passenger would want to make more frequent stops to stretch his legs, given the lump in the floor which I understand hides the catalytic converter, and no one but a child could make a roadtrip in this vehicle as a back seat passenger.

Speaking of children, my son's toddler car seat fits quite nicely in the back, and there are tether strap anchor points for two car seats. While I think his view was better from the passenger seat of the two-seater RX-7, in the Trans Am he can watch all the mirrors and has the view out the tinted glass T-tops. Although he does tend to kick the passenger seat some, he's got enough room to be comfortable, and his major problem appears to be when we stop -- he will start screaming, &quot;Go! Go! Go, car!&quot; I also find that it's nice to be able to reach easily to hand him things and so forth, without having to tell him to keep his hand off the shifter and not kick the stereo, like in a 2-seater. And of course, I love it that now all three people in our family can go for a ride in the fun car at once. 

The stereo is great. I did not opt for the 12-CD changer, figuring that if I do someday decide I want one, I can probably find one that will work with the car's head unit for under $600, the price of the factory-installed changer. I'm definitely going to get spoiled by the radio controls on the steering wheel, too.

I'm thrilled with the T-tops as an open air alternative to a convertible. Lots more openness than even a huge power moonroof gave me on the RX-7, and little enough wind turbulence that, even though I have three feet of hair, I am comfortable and hair doesn't get blown in my face, restricting my vision. An equally long-haired passenger reported the same thing. I've been advised, about the T-tops, to unlatch them in the event that the car ever needs to be jacked up, so as to avoid any potential torque being applied to that part of the car, which could result in a leaky T-top. By the same token, the manual says never to take the car through a car wash that sprays high-pressure water in the area of the T-tops, so it looks like this will be a wash-by-hand car forever. What's more, the manual says the chromed wheels are prone to damage by brushes in a car wash... so I guess I'll be washing it and making periodic visits to the upscale car detailers. 

Though classified as a sub-compact, this is a bigger car than you would think. It's nearly as long as my main squeeze's extended GMC Safari, and weighing in at 3500 pounds, almost as much as a Coupe DeVille and more than a Chevy S-10 pickup -- this car weighs as much as some SUVs. So you can't drive it like you would a lightweight vehicle. Nor does this vehicle get subcompact gas mileage: for Silicon Valley traffic driving (admittedly with the air conditioning on) I seem to be getting about 17 miles to the gallon.

The list of standard features on a Trans Am is truly exceptional, especially for the price. No, it doesn't have the full complement of luxury sedan features, but one wouldn't expect it to. But the list of standard equipment is long enough that it barely fits in the section for it on the car's window sticker. 

Overall, I would wholeheartedly recommend this car to anyone who wants a fun, fast car, with a few caveats: you won't be able to fit a huge amount of cargo in it (though it's got adequate space), you won't be able to carry around a gaggle of your friends, and it will be anything but cheap to fill it with the premium gas the manual sternly recommends. Additionally, I would not recommend this car to an inexperienced driver. The steep rake angle of the hood makes it hard to get a feel for where the car ends, and similarly, it's hard to know this moving in reverse. Further, with the major amount of oomph right at all speeds I've driven so far, and a top speed that's supposed to be 160 MPH, I would not recommend this for a driver who is inexperienced or prone to recklessness -- which is bad news, I suppose, for teenage boys who aren't inner children.<br><br>
