            I bought this car 6 years ago for my daughter to drive. Beleiving all the hype about legendary Volvo reliability. Beleive me its just a legend with no basis in reality. First there were the engine mounts --they get loose at about 50,000 miles and need replacement, front end alignment is a annual event, leave it in the snow three days and pay acouple of hundred to remove the rust on the brake rotors. A/C --now this is truly a mysterious event in this car with its climate control it periodically puts out a whimpy cold breeze --then a warm breeze --then none. Its sensing the tempature in the car (very poorly all the time). 
 This car squeaks, rattles, and odd pieces are always falling off. Molding from the door, or around a window, a latch here, a button there. I've replaced the horn button 3 times. Never fear though your trustly Volvo shop always seems to have just the part you need to fix it on hand. Think about it. The window wiper arms are bolted on with a nut that constantly comes loose. You replace the arms ($140 every 2-3 years). Of course you know when you turn on the wiper and they don't appear that its time. When I called my dealer he told me to keep a wrench in the glove box. Every try working under the hood no a highway in the dark while its raining. There are web sites discussing these problems as though they are common everyday car problems.
  I'll spare you all the dreary details of my adventures with Volvo and only mention two other items to be aware of:
If you fail N ox on the emmissions - its a new catalytic converter - $700 (there are no adjustments on this car!).
  If you ignition key fails to turn --$900 to replace the entire steering column. But again never fear your clever Volvo mechanic knows how to do it --he's done 100's. As a matter of fact out of the 6 Volvo specialty shops I tried they all knew about it over the phone and how to fix it.
  My swedish brick (see web site of same name) sits in the driveway waiting for AmVets to pick it up. Since my key won't turn in the ignition. Volvo when I contacted them said they recommend you replace the lock before this happens. Of course there is no warning it only had 82,000 miles on it.

PS. This is not a lemon story. This is normal Volvo stuff. If you look at their repair manuals you'll see they practically rebuild the car at the 75,000 mark. Ever wonder how those shops that only do Volvo work survive?
