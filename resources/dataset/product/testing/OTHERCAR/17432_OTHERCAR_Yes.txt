            I recently purchased a '99 Honda Passport EX-L.  After 3 weeks, I am still very happy with my decision, and let me tell you, it was an extremely informed one.  I spent 6 weeks researching, test driving, and scrutinizing all different makes and models of SUV's.  

First of all, the Honda Passport is basically an Isuzu Rodeo, which is a very capable SUV in itself, as Isuzu has a good reputation for their 4WD vehicles.  Honda does modify the interior somewhat, bringing it up a few levels from the Rodeo.  

When checking prices, the Rodeo's were not substantially cheaper, but they do offer a better warranty.  However, I think the warranty doesn't make up for the fact that Honda's resale value is something like 20% higher than an Isuzu. I feel with Honda's reputation, they would be very careful when choosing another makers auto to modify as their own.  

The Passport I bought is loaded, with leather, moon-roof, and a VERY capable 3.2L V6 with 206 HP.  This was a major attraction I had to the passport, as many of the SUV's I drove, were largely underpowered (Xterra, 4Runner, Pathfinder).  The Passports roominess dwarfed all the other SUV's I examined, except for the Jeep Grand Cherokee being similarly comfortable.  

The Passport exterior is very rugged looking, while the interior is functional, while remaining classy.  The Xterra's interior was very disappointing to me, looking extremely barren, and with their popularity with the 'Gen X' crowd, you won't purchase one under MSRP.  The Passport also doesn't sit quite as high as the 4Runner or Pathfinder, which makes it more stable around corners.  

In the end, I did like both the 4Runner and the Ford Exlporer Limited, but both these vehicles similarly equipped were well over $30,000.  I purchased the new '99 Passport for $26,000, which required a little haggling with the dealer, but I also knew that Honda was offering the dealer incentives to move the remaining 99's...which goes to show doing some research on the internet can be invaluable when it comes to negotiating. <br><br>
