            hi there, i own a neon and it has been my first car. I have found this car to be very dependable and has never let me down... I have driven it everywhere and have already got over 26,000 km on the car and it still has not presented me with a problem..  it may be a small car, but it is still very comfortable and very affordable, it costs half of what a larger car does and goes just as good and far... what it is like to drive this vehicle is it is nice and compact, easy to get in and out of places, people who are larger people would not like this car, as there is not enough room to accomodate the larger person.  I also work at a dealer and have found that the neon is a very popular car, especially the newer ones,, at a price even a student like me can afford..<br><br>
