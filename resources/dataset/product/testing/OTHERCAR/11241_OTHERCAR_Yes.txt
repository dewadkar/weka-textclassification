            My husband and I had one as a rental, and we both thought it was a fun little car to drive. We had a  GS model with ABS, which I have heard is hard to find. We had the car since Friday and dropped it off on Monday. We later went to a dealer Monday night and took a Aerio SX All Wheel Drive again with ABS out fora test drive. The All Wheel Drive has a heavy steering and you loose a little bit of horse power as well. Nothing too bad, I kinda liked the heavy steering you got.<p>                                                      We told the salesmen are situation and asked if we could trade in our 2003 Hyundai Tiburon V6 towards the car. He asked his manager if we could and he said yes. We both told him we would think about it. We were back two days later with the Tiburon and wanted to take again a Aerio SX out for a test drive. My husband liked it, I did not.<p>                                                      For starters the interior is too plushy and is not going to hold up to the normal wear and tear, also having the same material on the door is also quite dum. Also the seats did not offer me enough leg room and found out I could not get comfortable in them, and in less then an hour my knees were aching.The rear seat is the best in a lot of other small cars we have test drove and can easily accommodate a pair of six-footers in reasonable comfort. I have no problem with leg support in my Tiburon!<p>                                                  the car handled nice over the bumpsand is not jittery as one might think, my husband and i were impressed by that. Consumer Reports said the ride is stiff and choppy on any surface, with abrupt side-to-side motions, which it is not, the car handle the bumps beautifully!<p>  The 145-HP, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine provides adequate acceleration. It averaged 25 MPG overall in mixed driving on regular fuel. The four-speed automatic transmission shifts smoothly. the All-Wheel Drive is a 1,000 option.<p> The interior of the car is fairly spartan and the bits and peices of the trim fit well. Most controls are well placed and easy to use, although some minor ones are a little akward, like the cruise control. The handy clock and temperature display were a nice feature, the Aerio`s radio controls are large, clear and easy to access.The cup holders were nice, but would have like them more in the middle of the driver and the passenger seats, and not almost on the floor. Getting in and out of the car is easy with the tall roof and large openings.<p> You loose some of the trunk size on the SX model then you do on the S and GS models of this car. The 60/40-split rear seatback folds to enlarge it.<p> Suzuki claims to have the best warranty out there, but if you compare it with, Hyundai, you would see that Hyundai really does have the best warranty.<p>Overall the car is nice, and I might consider one in a couple years, if they improve on them. They have already improved on the horsepower with th 04`s, now they offer you 155 horsepower, but not nice enough for me to want to trade in my 03 Tiburon (which is more fun to drive) in on one. Also I think for the price of one, I think you are paying to much for one, it too was not enough for me to trade in my Hyundai.
