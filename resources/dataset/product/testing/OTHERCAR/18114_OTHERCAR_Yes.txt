            The Mystique caught my eye while driving past the dealership.  One closer look wouldn't hurt so around I went.  Test drive?  Sure, why not?  The seat just sort of hugged me and getting it into a good driving position was as easy as could be.  Radio, cassette player, clock, storage beyond the typical glove compartment.  Mirrors on both visors, driver controlled locks on doors and windows, dual air bags, even an overhead hand aid to help get the &quot;seniors&quot; out of the car.  Storage between the two front bucket seats.  Wow, if this drove like it looked.Out onto the highway and talk about great handling.  Oh, I was really getting hooked.  Turn signals, controlled wiper speed, anti lock brakes - the list goes on.  Back at the dealers I touched the brushed velvet interior, ran my hand across the padded steering wheel and said, &quot;At least I got to drive a rich man's car today.&quot;  As the salesman approached he smiled and asked, &quot;What do you think?&quot;  I knew I just couldn't afford such a &quot;gem&quot;, but I had to know.  Well, two years later, I still love my Mercury Mystique and am so glad I decided to check it out &quot;up close.&quot;<br><br>
