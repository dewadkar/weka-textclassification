            The new Volkswagon Beetle has got to be one of the best new cars of the Millenium. It totally took the nation by surprise when the producers brought it back out onto the market agian. This car is very fun, to drive and just look at. Whenever I see one of these cars rolling down the road I just have to stop and stare. I love the green colored ones. There are so many options for one to choose from. It's amazing really, that this car has come this far, and is still catches people's eye when it goes by. The producer has even put some of the original things in the list of options for people to choose from. I think that the new beetle is worth every dollar spent on it.<br><br>
