            The Oldsmobile Silhouette is a great minivan and the price is great too. My husband and I just purchased a 1999 Oldsmobile Silhouette and I must say it is the best investment in a vehicle I've ever made. We have 3 children ages 1, 2, and 13, and now we can all drive very comfortably and to boot the children can be entertained by the video entertainment center. The entertainment center has been a life saver for those long days when the babies have been at the daycare and are very tired, hungry and cranky. The entertainment screen really makes a hugh differents in the stress factor of life. There are a few things that I wish had been included in the van and also a couple of things I have had problems with. For one the automatic sliding door has been a bit of a problem. It doesn't always shut so you have to play around with it, sometimes I even have to move the van so the door will shut. Also there isn't any storage area available to the driver, for example there is no place to put your toll booth tokens or a box of tissues. The cup holder is on the side of the passenger seat so if you want to store anything in the weaved hanger that is between the two front seats you don't have anything to hold you beverage. However, overall this is a great minivan and I would recommend it to anyone.<br><br>
