             This car has to be one of the Best cars I have ever driven. I have one, it is laser red and drives like it is floating. The standard 4 door all wheel drive, is a great package, you can buy this package for somewhere around $35,000 - $40,000. There is also a package that consist of the 4 wheel drive along with 4 low and 4 high. This package can cost a person anywhere from $38,000 to $46,750. You can customize your tires also, from 17in to 36in that is what I have and it is wonderful. Being up high also is more comfortable but also is proven to be safer. The Navigator I have comes with the choice of an &quot;Alpine&quot; or &quot;Bose&quot; sound system. The &quot;Alpine that I selected sounds great it has the best sound and kick that I have heard in a factory system. I would say that the Bose probably sounds just as good or better. Well I hope this helps you with your decision to buy the &quot;Lincoln Navigator&quot; <br><br>
