            The DX3600 is a great camera overall.  To make this easy to read, I'll look at it in several different sections: Image Quality, Features/Ease of Use, and Batteries/Power.   

IMAGE QUALITY
This was my first real digital camera.  Before this I owned a 640x480 that didn't even have an LCD.  When I first "developed" the pictures from this 2.2 megapixel wonder, I was extremely pleased.  Every daytime shot was perfect, even with moving objects, which just doesn't happen with my 35mm camera.  90% of the lower light shots were great, but some taken indoors were a bit dark.  The red-eye reduction mode of the flash works great for people shots, but expect a bit more of a delay on the picture.  Overall, I would give this camera an 'A' for images.

FEATURES
This camera doesn't have that many controls, because Kodak prides themselves on making simple, easy to use cameras.  Although this camera is basically a point and shoot, there are some menu options to work with.  Some of the nicer ones include slide show, date stamp, three flash modes, LCD brightness, etc.  All of these work very well.  Some really good camera people may not like the fact that this camera has no controls for exposure, white balance, etc.  
I was also pleased to find out that this camera used CompactFlash, because Memory Sticks are too expensive and Smart Media Cards have been having some problems.      

POWER
I cannot stress this enough: DO NOT BUY KODAK RECHARGABLE BATTERIES!!!!!!  They are cheap quality and won't hold a good charge.  Also, save your money and DON'T get the Camera Dock.  What you do is buy a energizer NIMH battery and charger set and a card reader for the memory.  That will do the same thing as the dock, but it will save you about $40.
