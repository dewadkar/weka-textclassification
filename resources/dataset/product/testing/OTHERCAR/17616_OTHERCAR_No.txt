            I bought my neon in June of 1998 because I needed a smaller car ( I had an SUV) and I wanted better gas mileage. Since I bought my car I have been very disappointed. I live in a hilly development and cannot get my Neon to make it up most of the hills unless I push the gas petal to the floor and then it rarely goes above 30 m.p.h. I thought this was because it was a 4 cyl, but cars of a like type seem to have no problem. The neon is also difficult to back up it (maybe because of the spoiler), both my husband and myself have noticed it is difficult to see what is behind you because of the way the vehicle is designed. Perhaps my two biggest disappoitment came this pat winter. I had to pick my child up from day care and the neon would not make up a hill when there was two inches of snow on the ground,  my child was not in the car yet or we would have been stranded. When I decided the neon was not for me I went to trade it in and found it has lost it's value so quickly I owed $3000 more than it was worth and it was in excellent conidition. Although the neon was not for me I did get good gas mileage and never have had any problems with it breaking down. So it might be more suited for an individual who lives in a flat area.<br><br>
