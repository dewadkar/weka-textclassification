            Normally, I would not spend this kind of money on a camera, digital or not. I am a point-and-shoot kind of photographer. After a friend brought an earlier version of the Mavica to my son's birthday party, I decided I needed to do some more research.

Even though it is loaded with options, the built in floppy drive is THE reason I bought this camera. No extra cables or expensive media are required. Just pop in a floppy and you're ready to go. The floppy itself becomes a basic HTML page, organizing the photos for you for future reference.

My one reservation was the ability to have photos. My wife scrapbooks, and does not like the expense of printing out photo-quality copies on our printer. However, we have uploaded photos to snapfish and ordered reprints for only 50 cents each. The quality was great. I'm still amazed that I can't tell the difference between my prints from film and those from the Mavica.

My kids love the MPEG feature. I take little 5, 10, or 15 second movies (which easily fit on a floppy) and send them to grandparents on a regular basis.

It is very easy to use, though some of the advance features take a while to master. I really appreciate the multiple flash levels.<br><br>
