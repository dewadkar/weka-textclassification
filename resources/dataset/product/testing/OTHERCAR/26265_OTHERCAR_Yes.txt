            Well, as of December of 1999, I have been driving the Civic Si.  I am over all pleased with the car 100%.  I have had a few minor flaws in the car, but they are all bound to happen no matter what you buy.  

This car has a lot of power for the size and also the steering is outstanding.  The steering is extremely tight which makes it hug the curves extremely tight.  I can go around a curve at a good amount of speed and I will not hear one screech come from the tires.  The low profile Michelins that they put on the car go with the aspect of the car as well as the handling the car needs.  

I am very hard on cars.  And so far, the car has been able to stand up to the Rhode Island roads..(which are considered to be the worst in the country).  The clutch is so smooth making the gear box just want to give the car more and more power as u drive on.  And for passing speed...there is left over power in the car in 5th gear to pass a car when doing 80mph. 

I was amazed at how well the car felt on the road, in my hands, and how it looks.  I would convince all my friends and anyone in the world to by this car over any car in its class.
