            Ok, I've now owned my Vibe GT for about 6 months and 15,000 miles.  I purchased this car in February in Michigan after my Blazer ZR2 was totaled.  Other cars in the running were the Hyundai Tiburon, Subaru Impreza Wagon WRX, Toyota Celica GTS, and Dodge Neon SRT-4.

My final decision came between the Tiburon, which I really liked more, and the Vibe, which was more practical.  Well practicality won out.  I test-drove a GT model, which was the only one that would have enough HP for me.  Unfortunately I found out that the last 30 HP is above the 6,000 mark on the tach.  I decided to go with this model anyway as I needed a car quick and it seemed to fit the bill for gas mileage and price.  I mainly drive the car to and from work on a 100 mile round trip daily split between city and highway driving.  I also chose it to carry my 80-pound German shepherd and other bulky items.

Pros - I have been quite happy with the mileage that hovers in the high 20s even with my serious lead foot.  The car has also been quite pleasing to keep me at the head of the pack as long as I keep the RPMs at a high range.  I have been able to fit many things in and my dog is happy to have the whole back end.  It also seems to have great ground clearance for a car and handles the dirt roads quite well.  It also corners as well as many sports cars.  I have had no problems yet and the Toyota power plant has been living up to its reputation of reliability.

Cons - A week after I bought the car, it snowed.  That night the car was almost in the ditch.  The car has terrible handling in any slippery conditions.  I have not figured out if it's the tires, the lightweight, or the lack of AWD but it does not like winter.  As soon as the brakes are applied on snow or many times in rain, the ABS kicks in and does not help much.  This is the main reason that I will be trading it in for a more SUV like vehicle.  The lack of a decent engine in the AWD version frustrated me from the get go.  Other quirks are the lumbering shifter with reverse in a terrible position, the bad placement of the parking brake handle, the loud engine noise, required manual removal of the rear headrests before folding down the seats, and a plastic rear interior that has my dog and other items sliding all over the place when driving.

Overall I have been fairly happy with the car and have gotten used to many of its oddities.  As much as I thought I wanted the AC plug in the car when I bought it, I have not used it once!  It does not accommodate a three-pronged plug or many bulky adapters and therefore has been all but useless to me.

As an update to some asked questions I have added the following.  The car as the GT platform is only offered in the 1.8L engine out of the Toyota Celica GTS.  That's supposed to be the fast Celica.  It is fast but mated to the wrong gearbox in this case.  The power band for this engine is between 6000 and red line at 8100 RPM.  It works fine in the Celica, but with the Vibe's 6 speed that is mandatory for the GT, it has trouble staying in that upper band to get the true power.  This will not matter for most people as the lower RPM range has about the same power that the base model has throughout.  Most will not run the car to 8100.  All the controls are very much Toyota, but fully functional and easy to use.  Once you get used to the unique interior design, it is found to useful.  This with the exception of the parking brake which is too small and in a bad place.  The seats have a great cloth which resists most spills and dog hair.  The seats are all comfortable. I am 5'10" and have to have the driver's seat moved up a bit.  A 6'+ person would have no problems at all.  Likewise the back seats have more room than expected and are found to be more comfortable than many larger SUV rear seats I have been it.  While I have found the driver's seat to be quite comfortable, it does lack lumbar support and the knob the is there to tilt the seat is goofy and useless in my opinion.
