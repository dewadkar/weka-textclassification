                In commercials and in my dreams, I've drooled over the Chevrolet Suburban for years. Who wouldn't, with four active children, the occasional visitor, and boisterous pets to carry here and there?  Unfortunately, for many families, including mine, the sticker is the one hurdle to high to leap.  Until, of course, one decides &quot;now or never,&quot; and simply commits the hefty chunk of money needed to purchase a Suburban.  After that, the joy of finding something that is worth what it costs take over, and the financial sacrifice doesn't hurt quite as much.

   In April of last year--after renting a tiny, torturous car to visit my critically ill mother across the country in Tampa--the kids and I decided to take the plunge.  We knew that we were going back to Florida in April, my son was coaching high school football and track, and we just needed the spaciousness of one of the big SUVs.  

   In Laredo, prices are not as competitive as in other parts of Texas, and friends told us we could save money going to San Antonio, which is undoubtedly true.  But there had been a hail storm, and our local dealer had a damage sale--vehicles with various amounts of hail damage at discounted prices.  The Suburban LS we fell in love didn't have a mark on it, naturally--but we drove it off the lot the day we test drove it.

   My first concern, as a mother, was safety.  The incidents with Firestone tires and Explorers were being widely reported, and I was worried about the vehicle's stability.  On our 3,000 mile round trip to Florida we never experienced a bit of difficulty handling the vehicle.  There were uneven lanes in one place with graphic signs warning of vehicle rollovers, and quite a bit of construction, but our only near misses as far as accidents involved careless drivers.  And when someone behaved recklessly around us, the Suburban's easy maneuverability kept us out of trouble.

   My second concern was that I wouldn't be able to maneuver and park a vehicle that looks more compact on the outside than looking back from the driver's seat.  I'm not as tall as my children, and was worried that I might have poor visibility.  The large windows with their well-thought out curves give excellent open space to see through; even when I don't use my mirrors as frequently as I should, I can keep track of traffic around me.  I can also back and park easily.  In fact, two of my four children &quot;came of age&quot; in the Suburban, and used it for the driver's license test and that dreaded parallel parking.

  Comfort was also a key concern, because my daughters and I really suffered on our first trip to Florida.  We wanted a vehicle everyone fit in--there are six family members, a rottweiler, and a great dane.  Although the dane was just a puppy at the time of trip, we needed a vehicle he could still ride in as an adult.  

  The Suburban has room for all of us, including the dogs.  In Tampa, I had up to 9 people in the vehicle, 2 of whom usually suffer from motion sickness if they're not in the front.  They were able to read in any of the seats with no ill effects.  Additionally, on the way back, a sister rode with us.  The separate controls for the air conditioner were life-savers, as she is always too cold and the kids are always too warm.  We were all able to negotiate comfortable temperatures.  

  To save money, we shared the driving and didn't stop overnight on the way back; the front seats recline while still allowing the people in the middle seat enough room to be comfortable during nap breaks.  Speaking of money, we went at that period when gas was nearly $2.00 a gallon.  I didn't keep very accurate mileage logs, but we spent only $300.00 on gas round trip, using the vehicle extensively in city driving in Tampa.

  There are a number of other features I love, like the table with cup holders in the middle seat, and the hand grasps to climb up into the middle seat, since not everyone who wants a Suburban is tall enough or limber enough to get into a raised vehicle easily. 

  I had thought about a Ford Expedition, but rode in a friend's and didn't like it nearly as well.  The rear seats were raised, something like the seats in a movie theater, to provide a better view, I suppose.  I found them uncomfortable and annoying.  They were also harder to climb into.  And the side windows were smaller, so I suspect families with children might have more bickering over who sits where on long trips.

  The only problem we've had with the Suburban is that the interior lights had a bad fuse and the middle and rear windows didn't open correctly.  The dealer fixed both problems, but I heard from a friend that window problems are common with the 2000 model.

  After wanting a Suburban forever, we could have been disillusioned if the vehicle hadn't lived up to our expectations.  Now we can't imagine not having one.  Although we had no trouble finding space for everything on our July trip to Florida, we already have plans to use the luggage rack with a carrier for our next trip, to free up more interior space.  Having a vehicle that &quot;grows&quot; with us is a rewarding first!

  For family safety, comfort, and value, we're convinced it was worth every penny we pinched.  And as an added plus, while appearances shouldn't matter the most--it's a doggone pretty SUV, too!<br><br>
