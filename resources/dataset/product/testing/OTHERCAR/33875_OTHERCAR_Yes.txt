            One sentence: &quot;ONE AWESOME VEHICLE!!!&quot;

Mine: 1994 Toyota P/U 4X4 Std. Cab. 2.4L inline four cylinder SOHC, fuel injected, 5-speed w/ 116HP and 140lb-ft of torque. Goes anywhere, does anything, takes a lickin' and keeps on tickin'. Bought it new in 1994.
I have hauled trailers cross country, recovered stranded vehicles, climbed tops of mountains, crawled rocks, traversed snow, and gone to formals.

I am a one percent-er that uses my truck in the bush regularly. The four wheel drive with 4.10 axle ratio and free-wheeling hubs is unstoppable! There has not been anywhere that I could not go. My truck has been the one to save others lives and it has saved me. The flexibility of the suspension is excellent. The engine has plenty of torque to pull out even the toughest stuck full size pickup. 

The interior is handsome. It is easy to access and read every control. The transmission shifts flawlessly, the a/c freezes perfectly, and the heater is hot enough to cook with. The features are plain but intelligent. 
IMPORTANT: ALL EPINIONS MEMBERS PLEASE READ THE EPINION I WROTE, TITLED 'IT WON'T LAST LONG'. THERE IS SOMETHING YOU SHOULD KNOW.






Mine has over 124,000 miles and it has not been in the shop ever except for regular maintenance.

If you find one, BUY IT!!!<br><br>
