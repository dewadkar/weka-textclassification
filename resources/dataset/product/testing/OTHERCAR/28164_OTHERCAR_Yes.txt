            I recently purchased the Fuji Finepix S602z, and couldn't be more pleased with it.  Here is a quick outline of what I think are some of the most important features:
-Takes Compact Flash Types I and II (CFI+CFII) (so it can take microdrives)as well as Smartmedia (SM)
-Takes AA batteries so that you can use rechargeable NiMH AA's or Alkalines if you are in a pinch (instead of expensive proprietary rechargeables from companies such as Canon and Nikon) and it has great battery life
-Flash hotshoe for external flash attachment
-Big 6x (35mm-210mm) zoom

-Several burst/continuous modes
 1-Up to 5 shots @ 5 fps, full resolution
 2-Up to 25 shots @ 5 fps, full resoltion BUT only the last 5  are saved (this is nice in action situations when you can't  really anticipate the action, this way you hold the shutter  release early without wasting shots, and let go when the   actions done)
 3-Up to 40 shots @ 1.8 fps, 1 megapixel resolution
-Two different movie modes, both are 30fps (like tv) w/ sound, and limited only by the size of the storage media and its transfer rate(SM is fast enough to store video till its full, however most CF only stores about 30 seconds at most because of its lower sustained transfer rate, on the other hand microdrives are fast enough and can also be filled with video to their capacity).  One mode is 320x240, the usual for digital cameras, but the second mode 640x480 is really nice.  NO other digital still camera on the market today does 640x480 resoltion(640x480 resolution approaches DV quality).    

-VERY fast shot to shot times (many digitals take 3+ seconds to store the image before you can take another, this camere takes a little over ONE second)
-VERY little shutter lag (many digitals have a bad 'lag' time between you pressing the shutter release and it actually taking the picture)
-Well placed tripod mount (Good balance, and you still have access to the battery compartment and the CF/SM compartment)
-Full Automatic mode if you want to let the camere take care of all the settings (and it does a good job of it)
-Manual controls if you want to take control of shutter speed,apeture,ISO,EV,focus(very nice manual focus ring)

I cannot say enough about how please I am with this camera.  It is a lot of fun, and easy to use.  My experience with cameras before this has been mostly point+shoot film based (and one point and shoot digital), and yet the manual features on this camera are so easy to understand, i switched to full manual mode after the first few days.  I would suggest this camera for people who want a little more control over their pictures than point+shoots give, a bit of zoom, and a GREAT value.  Most cameras with similar specs are $200+ more than this camera.

I would suggest purchasing this camera with 2 Sets of 4 1700mAh+ NiMH AA's ($10-$20 each set), a NiMH charger ($20), and a 340MB Micrdrive($100-$150).
You can also purchase a filter tube adapter that allows you to attach 55mm filters/lenses to the camera for about $30-.
