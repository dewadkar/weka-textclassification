            I, actually own two Achieva.The first one was purchased for my wife, and for a 1.5 years when I have opportunity to drive it, I was enjoying it, especially couple times when we took long trips. Very economical, reliable, and comfort is more than just an average. I liked it so much, that when time came for me to start looking for a newer car, I new what I am doing to look for. It took me some time, but now we have twins at home, the only difference is a color, even model S is the same. Of course, I have to mention that both cars have V6. This was my choice, because I knew that Quad4 is not very good engine, and at the same time V6 3100 is one of the best on the market. For two years since I first introduced myself to Achieva,I feel that it was very good choice. No visits to the shop, very good mileage for gas. Very easy to maintain, which basically every man can do himself, including change oil, antifreeze, plugs, etc. It does not mean that I already done it, I just studied this car how I am going to do this. I did not have a chance to drive this car with V4, but with the V6 it drives like a race car. With proper care, this car will last for a long healthy life. I would strongly recommend anyone who is looking for a used car at least consider this one as a front runner.<br><br>
