            Great value for the money, lots standard like ABS brakes and AC.  Great service for the minor new car quirks, but very minor!!!  Highly recommend, great handling, solid feel. Very roomy rear seat.  Excellent standard sound system.  Brakes have a very solid feel.  Excellent fit and finish. Very roomy trunk that will fit anything!  Controls are easily identifiable and located well for windows, doors, radio and heater and AC.  Only two complaints are that there should be more thigh support for driver seat and tires other than Firestone should be used.  They have worn very poorly and I only have 25,000 miles!  Great car otherwise.     <br><br>
