            When we first started looking at minivans, the Honda Dealership was just an obligatory stop along automobile row.  When the salesman said that we would have to order the van, pay full sticker, then WAIT 6 weeks to get it, I thought he was out of his mind.  But a friend of mine had done just that and was kind enough to let me drive her van.  I knew immediately that no other van would do!  

The Odyssey has more room than any van I have ever seen.  We were able to put two strollers in the back of the van and were at the STARTING point of storage in any other van.  Later, when we travelled to the beach together, she was able to fold the rear seat down (with one hand) and we had incredible cargo space!  

The Odyssey has much more spunk than the other vans that we drove.  If you have to drive a mini van, at least you should have one with some &quot;get up and go&quot;. 

What sealed the deal was when I began researching the safety of the Odyssey.  It was the only van to get all 5 stars in the government crash tests.  It was also chosen number one in safety and reliability by Consumer Reports magazine.  

I highly recommend the Honda Odyssey for anyone who has children.  This van will handle four child seats with ease.  In addition, for older children there are temperature controls for each seat.  No more whining from the back &quot;I'm hot.....I'm cold&quot;.  Plus there is actually room for the children, their paraphernalia AND groceries!<br><br>
