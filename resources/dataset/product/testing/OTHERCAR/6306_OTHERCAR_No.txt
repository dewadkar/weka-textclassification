            I took over the payments on this car from a friend that had leased it. I liked the cars design and overall seemed to be a good investment. I was going to pay off the balance and resell it and take home a couple thousand dollars. It was sold to me far below book, and I didn't see any problems in the resale. Boy was I wrong. 

First to tell you a little bit about the vehicle. 
This is the 1996 Dodge Avenger ES 2.0, 16 valve, 4 cyl. coupe. It has a five speed trans. and gets pretty good gas mileage. 

Some of the things that I liked about this car was:
1. Pretty cool in design. (It's not too bad for a coupe)
2. Good gas mileage(as noted above) I would get about 25mph (average)


More about the things that I didn't like so much:

1. This car is HEAVY! It is like a tank at times, and because of the weight of the car the engine cannot put out enough to make it zip like you would like it too.

2. I might just be too fast of a driver but the tires that I had on the car didn't last at all. I know this isn't a review on tires but in my opinion this heavy beast is to blame for the short life of the tires that it wares. I had 4 bald tires before I hit 30,000 miles. 

3. The cruise control on the car is just a pain. It's not like other normal cars. I think that you have to take too many steps to make it operate the way that it should. You have to turn it on (located on one side of the steering column), then flip the lever on the other side. It's just not practical to use, or try and learn, or mess around with when you are moving at over 75mph.

4. I didn't like how the seats where so low in the car and the driver's side window was so high. If you want to stick your arm out the window it's not comfortable, you have to strech to do so. I'm 6&quot;3 so it's not a height factor.

5. As noted I'm tall. The center counsel can be a nuisance for your legs. I couldn't take this car on long trips because I just couldn't get comfortable and relax. 

6. Most of all, what I disliked the most was the resale on this car. It was terrible. I think this car was over $16,000 and at 37,000miles and less then 4years old I was almost begging for someone to take it at $8,000 in my local paper i see the same year going for around $6,000 that is terrible for someone that is interested in getting something back on this car.

7. Plus: This car burns/leaks oil, I had to take it into the shop to check it out. I find out that the main gasket in the engine is shot and had to have the whole engine pulled and put back together. I was lucky that it was still covered under the warranty (over $600) but my image of the craftsmanship of the car isn't the highest. Also the Car hums on the passanger side when I would take it on the interstate. 

This is a good car for college students. It's not the smoothest ride, but it's a cheap car. Would I buy one again? No Way! You can find a better car for your money. (at least the ES)
The car is flashy and if you aren't in college or someone between 18-25 you might send of the wrong signals to co-workers etc. 

In conclusion, this is a nice looking car that has its problems. I haven't had a time where the car wouldn't start, but I cannot say that I am confident in the dependability of this car. Choose wisely friends.<br><br>
