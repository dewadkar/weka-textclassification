            The 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee is one of the best &quot;highway&quot; vehicles I've ever driven. Comfort, safety and great visibility make for a great trip. I've got 36,000 miles on my current Jeep, and traded 18 months ago when I was in my third year with an identical 1994 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo. My 2 wheel drive model has excellent handling in snow, and the interior is roomy with solid back support. As a boy scout leader, our troop seems to think this is the only way to travel. Probably the best SUV on the market!
The in line six cylinder engine is more than adequate for hauling big loads and intermediate towing assignments.<br><br>
