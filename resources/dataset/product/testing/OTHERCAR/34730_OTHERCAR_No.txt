            Before purchasing a CLK 430 Cabriolet my Father purchased a Sebring to see whether he would like a Convertible. This was a big mistake. Even for the low price the Sebring was still a joke. When driving anywhere above 30 MPH the back window would begin to rattle. Also when entering the car you would have to pull a lever to move the seat forward to let passengers into the rear. No problem expect a extremely larger noise would come from the seat. The cars handling was no better either. When making a U-Turn the car would make it so broad. The turning circle must be huge! The Handling and Response is absolutely pitaful. Driving the car was no excitement. Also the front seats were rather un-comfortable and offered no back support at all leaving the driver and passenger with back cramps. As much as I hate the car I must say the rear seats were reasonable comfortable. There were a few good points although. The Soft Top is insulated and pretty nice. The back seats also provide nice leg room and so do the front.

Well If you have a small budget and need a convertible grab a Sebring. Otherwise steer-clear. Maybe it was just our car that had these problems or maybe it was a mass-production problem. For the money the car isn't terribly bad. Just remember you will have to put up with some of these possible problems! Maybe if you went up a step to the JXi or the Limited you would have a better experience than I did.<br><br>
