            The main attraction of this car has to be the price.  At S$69,888 this is definitely the best value-for-money car one can find in Singapore.  The Sephia is actually more spacious inside than viewed from outside, and can easily accommodate 3 adult passengers at the back.   Styling is pretty neutral, neither outrageous nor conservative.  

On the move, the car is relatively quiet, except for the noise generated from the Korea-made Hankook tires.  Seating position is easily adjusted, with height-adjustable seat belt anchorage and front height-adjustable driver seat.  Speed sensitive power steering feels good, and for a budget car, it even comes with power wing mirrors and a dimmer for instrumental light!  A single-disc CD player with 6-speaker system comes standard as well.  The 1.5l DOHC engine feels lively, though not eager at revs above 4,000 rpm.  Suspension is above average, offering a generally smooth ride. 

One complain, the hand-brake has not been re-positioned for the right-hand -drive model, it is on the front passenger's side instead of the driver's!  The 4-spoke steering wheel looks decent enough, but I must say that the panels were produced to a budget, and I'm not really convinced that they will last.

This car will certainly find a home with those who are budget conscious.  I have ordered the car, now awaiting its delivery.<br><br>
