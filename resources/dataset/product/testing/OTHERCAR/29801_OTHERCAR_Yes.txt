            I bought this camera for two reasons 1) Its a Kodak!  This is a respected name and I felt certain that I would get a good product.  2) It came highly recommended by a friend in the computer industry whom I highly respect!  Armed with this knowledge and a receipt so I could return the camera if it failed to meet my expectations, I just marched in, grabbed one off the shelf and bought it!  

What I got was far more then I expected.  Just point and click and you have a remarkable image.  This is the most basic application.  From there you begin to experiment and find that you can organize your photos user defined folders.  There are several focusing methods.  Light and White balance are selectable or automatically controlled - its up to you! 

Cool bells and Whistles:  Select text and/or date to appear on each photo.  Built in audio recording and playback for each photo.  Use your camera like a video camera for your computer (i.e. internet phone or web camera)- This list goes on!

Downsides:  There a couple of problems but they seems to be inherent to the digital camera world not just to the Kodak DC series.  Unless you buy the AC adapter you will be spending a lot of time and money changing batteries.  And unless you purchase the optional parallel uploading device you will be spending a lot more time waiting for images to upload via the asynchronous port.  The USB interface is faster and better then asynchronous data transfer� but the wait time is still somewhat painstaking. 

What I found best about this product though is NOT the bells and whistles but the quality of picture I got!  We are talking about pixel density that my monitor could not display.  With the right printer (I use the Epson Color Stylus 850 1440x750dpi) and -photo quality paper you can truly get amazing clarity photo printouts.  

In conclusion and to sum it all up I would have to say  �Kodak � Way to Go!�  I have had people ask me where I got my pictures taken and blown up to 8.5� x 11�.  When I tell them I did it with the Kodak DC260 and printed it out in my home office they are blown away � and you will be too!
