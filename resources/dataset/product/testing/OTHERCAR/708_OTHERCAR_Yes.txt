            A digital camera is a sensitive device and requires love and care for a long life. Nikon takes it to an extreme. It is an overtly sensitive one...that resorts to whirring sounds on a medium to rough usage...like turbulence in airlines. The whirring sounds degenerate in clicking and finally a loss of picture prompting you to call up the tech support. 

I found that I wasnt alone in this experience. The whirring clicking sound seems to be a oft reported problem.

It also has tricky controls, a user interface thats not very intuitive, and yields a low battery life.

On the sunnier side, it produces good results and has a good view tracker.

Be extra...extra careful with this baby...its a crybaby for one.<br><br>
