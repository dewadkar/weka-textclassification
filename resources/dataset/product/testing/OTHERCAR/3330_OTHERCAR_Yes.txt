            I've owned two Bravada's now and have found them to be an excellent value for the price. Oldsmobile has engineered a vehicle that is fun to drive, a workhorse and a very comfortable family car. The Smart-Track system is a life saver. In bad weather, and Michigan get's plenty of it, it handles as if it was a warm summer day. There's no slipping or sliding on wet or snow covered roads. The interior of the vehicle is richly done with an instrument package that's convenient and easy to operate. The most admirable feature of this vehicle is its maintenance. The first Bravada I leased only needed to be in the shop twice. The vehicle I currently lease made its first trip to the shop just last week for a breather valve. I've had it since 1997. In summary this is a great car with super features.<br><br>
