            Last things first- the PT Cruiser is a two thumbs up.  Even though I prefer a car with oh say 365 horsepower, this four cylinder slow-poke scores a direct hit with me.  You simply have to give extra credit for styling that denotes anything more daring than an Altima and pricing that anyone can afford ($22,000 loaded, AFTER this initial added dealer mark-up period runs its course).

Just look at the range of itches this car can scratch.  Do you have kids?  A dog?  Many dogs?  Many kids and dogs?  Well, here is a vehicle that can haul a load while not humiliating every time a hot girl pulls abreast at the stoplight.  You also won't worry about destroying the fine interior hauling those dogs because  you aren't paying for rich Corinthian leather here.  Do you want a car with unlimited customization possibilities?  Here it is and brand new with warranty to boot.  Can you say hopped up computer chips, projector beam halogen headlights and carbon trim panel parts?  
And probably one of the largest market sectors for the PT, teenagers, students and all the under 25 crowd.  Remember that putt putt engine?  Perfect for those teens riding on mom and dad's insurance.

The PT is priced right, drives great (seating position is bolt upright but the headroom is generous), has that new-Beetle distinctiveness that is almost unheard of these days especially for a car in this price range, and probably will deliver excellent long-term quality satisfaction numbers due to the comparatively simple and tried and true mechanical content.  This car does not contain any radical or revolutionary mechanical advances, any cutting edge hiptitude stops with the exterior. And, most people will love or hate that exterior.

Please buy this car in the vast numbers Daimler-Chrysler expects.  We need the inspiration to embolden all other car makers, and fast.  Seen a Nissan lately?  Didn't think so, the dealers haven't seen you lately either.
