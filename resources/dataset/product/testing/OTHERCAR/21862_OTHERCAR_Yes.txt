            I absolutely LOVE my Subaru Outback Limited.  It is safe and reliable.  

Positive Qualities:
High ground clearance - higher than many SUV's.  

Weight - The Subaru weighs almost as much as a Cadillac.  The heavier the car, the better it will fare in an accident and this car is as solid as they come.

Cargo space - I just spent the weekend moving into a new house just using a pickup and my Subaru wagon.  The pickup was better for furniture because the space was not confined but the car was better for boxes.  Better than a pickup truck?  Yes, because I could stack the boxes high.  I could fit 24 boxes (the kind reams of paper come in) in just the back area!

All Wheel Drive - We bought the Subaru because it was the only car below an Audi with all wheel drive.  We could have bought an SUV but we love the gas mileage and the luxury feel of this car.

Compliments Galore! - I have never had so many compliments on anything in my life as I have on this car.  We have a couple friends who never tire of telling us how much they like it.  One guy stopped me at the gas pump to ask what I thought of my car.  He thought they were beautiful vehicles and wanted to buy one.  I told him I loved it.


Drawbacks:
Power - It could use a little more horsepower. It has almost enough power, but could use a bit of a boost.
