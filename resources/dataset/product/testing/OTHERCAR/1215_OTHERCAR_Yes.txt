            My husband has owned his Jeep Comanche pick up truck since 1990 and I have to say it is one of the most reliable trucks I have ever seen. He has had it for ten years and has hardly had any problems with it at all which is not something you can say about a lot of cars and trucks. 

It has over 100,000 miles on it and is still going strong. He had to replace the brakes once a couple of years ago and has replaced the battery once but other than that he has never had it in the shop. About the worst problem he has with it now is that the tape player in it does not work but that is really minor compared to the troubles most people have with their automobiles. 

Everyone who has ever owned a Jeep Comanche has told us they love them and they are great trucks and several people have even offered to buy his Comanche from us since they know it is so reliable. 

The only real downfall of his truck that I can think of (besides not having air conditioning)is that it does not have much cab room and is not really a great family type vehicle but for him just driving it to and from work it suits us just well since I have my own car for family use. 

It is nice for use of hauling stuff though, especially when moving it has really came in handy. All in all I would have to give it a definite  thumbs up!<br><br>
