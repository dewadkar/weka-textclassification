            I leased this vehicle because my 1999 Boxster was NOT reliable, after being on a flatbed 3 times in 10 months, I wanted out.  I loved the car, but it just wasn't reliable enough.  I wasn't prepared to give up on Porsche, so I'm trying again.

This new car has subtle changes, but significant ones.  Having driven both, I can say that the 2000 Boxster is significantly better than the 1999.

There is naturally the small increase in horsepower and torque.  The big difference is that it now comes in around 2200 rpm instead of 4500.  The torque keeps pulling all the way up to the rev limiter too.  I'm told this was to make the tiptronic versions more responsive.

This car has the sports suspension (commonly known as the 030 option).  It rides quite a bit stiffer than the stock suspension, but it is not harsh at any speed.  Totally unnecessary unless you plan on racing the car.  The stock car handles very well.  The car does feel a lot more solid when closing doors with the sport suspension.

The top has a thicker lining so there is now less wind noise than before.  Too early to tell if it will be any warmer in winter.

There have been numerous other cosmetic changes that I won't go into.  My primary reason for getting this car was to be my daily driver and to race in autocross events.

This will be a daily driver and will see all 4 seasons.  I'll be ordering a set of snow tires later in the year.  I don't anticipate any problems with driving the car in the snow - except maybe deep snow.

Now for the fun stuff - autocrossing.  This car is super for autocrossing.  Put a set of race tires (Kumho's) on the car and it positively flies.  I have been able to consistently index in the top 5 in every event since getting this car.  This car stops and turns in.  It does have a tendency to understeer in the longer turns.  Lots of fun nonetheless.  This is why I chose this car.  I wasn't sure if this was a wise choice trading in the 1999 for a 2000 until I autocrossed it.  This is a significantly better car for autocrossing.

No maintenance problems yet.  I have around 1300 miles on the car at this time.  I'll update later in the year.

I am planning on getting a tow hitch installed so that I can tow a small trailer with my race tires to the various race events that I attend.
---------------------
It's now Sep 2002.  For the most part, the car has been reliable.  There have been a few mechanical problems: clutch replaced @ 15,000 miles.  Dealer and Porsche would not warranty the clutch.  Very unhappy about this.  There is a knocking from the front - apparently some bushings (I believe) that need to replaced only if the Boxster is driven hard.  A micro-switch in the handbrake that was stopping the handbrake light from coming on.  This also prevent operation of the top (which requires the hand brake to be on).

Still an unbelievable autocross vehicle for one that is absolutely stock.
