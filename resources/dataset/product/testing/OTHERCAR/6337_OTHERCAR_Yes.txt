            I was looking for a car to use in my business that would be presentable, but that would not take as much investment as many luxury cars. Volvo is a thinking man's car. 

The Volvo Coupe is an extremely pleasant car to drive. The cars steering is responsive. You can impress your friends with Volvo's tight turning radius. The gas mileage is acceptable. And the Coupe has adequate power to enter freeways or get out of danger.

I drive about 5,000 to 6,000 miles each month. The Coupe is a comfortable car to remain in for a long period of time.

Volvo's famous safety features are well earned and there are times every week when I witness terrible drivers doing terrible things that I am thankful that I have those safety advantages around me. In fact, the reason that I bought this Volvo was the fact that a previous Volvo saved my life.

I was parked on a photo station stop high in the mountains near Tahoe. The earth underneath the pullout had washed away. The pavement literally snapped and sent me tumbling down the mountain, repeatedly turning over and over. My car was totaled. I walked away with only bruises. Give me Volvo.
