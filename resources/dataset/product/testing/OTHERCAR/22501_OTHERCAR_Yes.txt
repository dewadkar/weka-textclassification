            This is a great car that was very well engineered.  I personally traveled to Germany and back over a dozen times to work with German engineers to help make this a great car for the North American market.  The one I own has a 4 cylinder automatic with very few options (everything I wanted was included in the base model).  It is very peppy and never fails to get me out in trafic or to pass someone on a two lane block top.  This car was based off of a German car called the Vectra so it is designed for Autobon speeds and handles the express way very nicely.  The interior is very roomy for a small/mid-size car.  I can fit all three of my children in back seat with little problem.  Two out of my three are still in car seats if that gives you an idea of the size.  Gas mileage is very good, near 30 overall.  The stereo system isn't bad for factory and you can order a new one with an upgraded system that really rocks.  The trunk is decent sized.  I'm a musician and I frequently carry my guitar amp, effects and guitars around without a problem.  You might think I am biased because I worked on this car but let me just say that there are plenty of other cars I have helped develop that I do NOT own.  When you consider the cost of this vehicle and the performance you get its a great car and is under priced in my opinion.  Get one, you won't regret it.
