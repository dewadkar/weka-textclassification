            I used this camera this past summer on a camping trip with 25 junior high students.  We used it to take pictures of the kids activities to send home via e-mail for the kids' parents.  This camera worked great!  I enjoyed using this digital camera so much better than a conventional one.  The coolest thing was that you could immediately view the picture and retake it if you did not like the way it turned out.  My only complaints about the camera are that downloading pictures directly from the camera is very slow, but an external drive fixes this problem.  Also, the picture viewing program that come with the camera is not enough for editing pictures.  I recommend Photoshop.  <br><br>
