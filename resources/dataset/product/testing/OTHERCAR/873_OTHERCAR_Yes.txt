            I've owned the Olympus C-3000 for over a year now and have taken close to a thousand or more pics with it. With each use of the camera it gets easier to use. At first all the controls and menus it has was daunting but now I realize I wouldn't want a camera without all the features. This camera does it all! The picture quality for a 3.3 megapixel camera is awesome. Play with some of the manual controls and you can get pretty creative with your shots. The auto focus works I would say 80% of the time. Great tool.
 Make sure you get a 128MB Smart Media card you will enjoy being able to take quite a few pics before you need to run back to the computer to download them. I've shot over 80 pics in HQ mode and still had room. When you want to shoot pics for email or 4X6 shots you can cram about 500 or more on a 128MB card.  The flash could be a little better but the information on the website is accurate. After about 8-9 feet you can tell the flash is at it's limit. Powers up in about 3 seconds and your ready to start shooting. Record times to memory card is pretty fast about 1-2 seconds if your shooting in HQ mode and a little faster in lower settings. 
 The camera is durable, I've banged it around alot in the last months and it's still kicking. If you can find one on Ebay or where I bought mine from Half.com you can probably get them now cheap. You won't be sorry great cam. I've used Fuji and Canon Digital cams and this is the best so far.
 Records little videos about a minute in length with audio, just make sure you have good light or it will come out grainy. Works great outdoors and poor indoor lighting.
