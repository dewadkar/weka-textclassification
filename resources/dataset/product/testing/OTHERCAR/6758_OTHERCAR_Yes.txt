            What can you expect from a 4wheel drive SUV, that costs under $20,000 including tax and destination charge? A lot, actually. This is my first foray into Hyundai, and I bought this car because I wanted a "winter" car. New Jersey has been hit lately with some paralyzing snowstorms. Being a mom, I can't always trust my cute little Neon to get me where I need to go in the snow. 

I thought a lot about what I wanted from an SUV, and really, status aside, I decided that the Hyundai Santa Fe fit right into my life. For now.... 

One of the key factors in this decision was the "disposability" factor. It's a cheap vehicle, with a strong warranty, and if I keep it for two years, or even for 5 years, (the full warranty term) I can't lose. 5 years leasing a Jeep, I'd spend as much. And for that matter, wouldn't be covered after year 3. 

Upon first look, the Santa Fe is a nice looking truck. The low, flat front end looks a little 'station wagon-ish' but, all in all, the paint job is pretty, and the two tones make for a sharp looking car. I chose mine in Silver. The interior is comfortable, in the front and rear. No complaints about the ride, either. Smooth. As with any SUV, you feel like you might tip over at times, while sharply turning at higher speeds. The Santa Fe makes no exceptions. 

The Santa Fe LX comes standard with cruise control, remote keyless entry, power and heated mirrors, and daytime running lamps. Also available is the 4 speed shiftronic, and V6-cylinder engine, with the 4 wheel drive. Also ABS comes standard on the 4WD. MacPherson strut front suspension and double wishbone rear suspension make the Santa Fe's handling a veritable dream. Also available is the optional limited slip differential. 

Did I mention that 5 year warranty? And did I also mention the 10 year power train warranty? 

The interior of this vehicle is beautiful, although a few buttons on the dash feel a little "inexpensive." The front leather bucket seats are comfortable and classy. The split rear folding leather seats are comfortable and practical. The rear trunk space is adequate, as with any comparably sized SUV. 

Available too, are the side impact air bags, and front dual airbags. I'm a fan of safety, as I enjoy living, basically, so for me, it was a no-brainer. 

The cupholders, excellent. The glove box, perfect. The center console, is roomy. There is a place for everything and I like that. The Santa Fe also comes with a roof rack, which can come in handy when venturing to IKEA- of course I don't ski, but maybe a bike might make it's way up there. We'll have to see. 

So what don't I like about this car? Not much. Other than the social stigma of driving a Hyundai. No one seems to recognize the car. They ask me what kind of car it is. I answer, "It's a Santa Fe." Not wanting to admit to the Hyundai part. But eventually I give in. I am met with raised eyebrows. It really is a luxurious car for the price. Yes, the design is a bit odd. Sort of like the "odd" design of the Toyota Rav4 or the Durango. But, I've gotten used to it. 

The styling is nice, if you like that sort of thing. The recessed foglams are sharp, the rear corner-style lights are nice, and the rear hatch door has a window which opens independantly. The interior is well managed, and the stereo with CD changer and Navigation system is classic! You won't feel Hyundai in this SUV, trust me. Take it for a test drive. 

My first time in the snow was last week, when we had about 20 inches fall in northern New Jersey. I was happy that I was able to go out in the weather and not worry about getting stuck. I fared very well, thank you, and all for some pocket change, basically. 

Hyundai is pushing these suckers right now, and if you're interested, now is the time. They'll give you 0.9% financing, and or about $1500 cash back, and you can get them to go down about 10-15% on the sticker price. Don't forget too, that the warranty is worth something. 5 years of freedom is worth a lot to me. I know that any new car is going to have a problem or two. Usually within the first two years. But that extension to 5 years is terrific. 

So far, I love this vehicle, and I hope my Neon doesn't get jealous!
