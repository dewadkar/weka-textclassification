            I am a Honda person.  I have owned one forever.  I bought the first Odyssey in 1996.  I adored it!  It was the best drive, and it felt like I was driving a nice car, not a van. 

Then it was redesigned.  Power doors! Excellent, I thought.  I upgraded last September, (after waiting 6 months), to an EX 1999 Odyssey.  Three days later, the power doors started jamming.  The buzzer would buzz for no reason, the doors would not open unless manually opened, and finally, THE DOORS WOULD OPEN BY THEMSELVES AS I WAS DRIVING!! Not good with three small children in the car! The car was in the shop three weeks out of the first four months I owned it, all for this problem.  Honda would not take the car back. ( I had to wait for one of my kids to get sucked out of the car while driving I guess.)  Finally, they fixed them on the third try.  I later found out that there has since been a VERY HUSH HUSH recall for this same problem.  (I have the memo obtained by a friend who is a Honda car dealer to prove it.)
Also, two of my friends with the EX had similar door problems, and still do.  Buzzers that won't shut off unless you disable the power switch, doors that need to be shut manually, jamming doors that won't open at all, etc.

The Odyssey is a great van with a superb 4 star crash test record.  But my advice is to stick with the LX model which has manual doors.  The same great car without the dangerous, pain in the neck power doors.  <br><br>
