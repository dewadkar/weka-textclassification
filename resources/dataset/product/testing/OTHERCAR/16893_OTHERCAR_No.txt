            The FD95 is a good looking, very feature packed camera - but...
The Sony brain-trust must have been fried when they added two specific features to the FD95.   First they <b><i>Freeze</i></b> the viewfinder while it is autofocussing.  The autofocus takes from .5 to 1+ second.  If you are trying to follow any action this annoying feature simply won't let you.  The delay between pressing the shutter button and the actual picture being taken is expected and well understood.  But freezing the image for a second while you are trying to follow your son and a soccer-ball is - well, it's <b>LUNACY</b>!  
Switching to manual focus to try to avoid this is fruitless.  While the freeze is less (not gone, just less) they included a feature designed to &quot;help&quot; you focus.  Every time you touch the focussing ring the image is magnified in the viewfinder by 2X.  If, once again, you are trying to follow action while focussing - <i>you can't</i>. 
I returned my 95 because of these two features.  Sorry Sony - but you either planned this to be annoying (for upgrade purposes) or you simply don't know enough about the market you are selling to.
Otherwise the camera is wonderful.  Good feel, good quality photos, excellent features.  Just an incredibly dumb freeze &amp; 2x focussing mag.<br><br>
