            I entered a note about this Blazer before but I can not find it.  The automatic headlights are uncontrollable and come on when they want to.  They do not go off till after the sun has been up for 30 to 45 minutes.  this makes it impossible to see the overhead console lights, radio lights etc. because they are dim when the headlights are on.  The driver can not turn this feature off.  Also the service tech can not turn this feature off.  The computer climate control is also driving me nuts.  It runs the fan when ever it decides to even though the fan control is in the off position.  It also varies the temperature of the air coming from the vents.  It blows hot, cold, alternating, in about a 1 minute cycle after it reaches the temperature set on the dial.  

Also this car has been the shop 8 times already and is going in again next week.  It is not as reliable as it should be for a new car.  I will not buy another one.  I would trade this one off but a Chevy SUV is only worth less than 1/2 of what it cost 1 year ago so I will have to drive for a while. I think this is a poor value for the cost.<br><br>
