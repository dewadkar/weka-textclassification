            What's the big deal with SUV's?  Maybe there's something wrong with me but I don't understand their popularity, today.  To try to understand this weird public madness, we rented a new Infinity QX4 for a trip from SF Bay Area to Portland, OR, a round trip of 1500 miles.  We did this last week, partly out of curiosity and for consideration of some possible storm systems in the high mountain passes we had to travel through.  We have driven this many times in the past in our regular vehicles, a '90 4-cyl. Camry LE and an '88 Acura Legend.  We are a family of 4 (2 adult sons).  I'm 5' 7-1/2&quot; and the boys are 5' 8&quot; and 5' 10.&quot;  My wife is small at 5' 2&quot;.  So, we are not a large family by any means.  We make the 700+ mile trip in about 10 hours so we are not dawdling along the way.

It was an interesting experience - one that convinced me that my prior impressions were correct - SUVs of this class and format are highly overrated.  These are multiple purpose, compromise vehicles.  As such, they don't do any one function well.  Instead, we are forced to accept mediocre to poor performance in many areas.  The &quot;sport&quot; part of an SUV is in the owner/driver - you have to be a good sport about driving to tolerate and fund them.  Except for the specifics noted below for the QX4, these general comments should apply to the Izusu Trooper, Jeep Grand Cherokee, Mitsubishi Montero, Toyota Forerunner, etc.

The ride is the pits.  It's jiggly/jouncy and busy on concrete or grooved pavement at 70 mph.  It wanders in high or gusty winds.  It's high off the ground and feels tippy and makes exit/entry a chore.  They lack decent leg room.  They lack carrying capacity under the tonneau cover behind the rear seats - less than the closed trunk of the Camry or Acura Legend.  The purchase price is expensive and the gas mileage is abysmal.  And their lights blind other drivers.  They're heavy and underpowered.  So, what is it that makes them so popular with the public?  Sitting up high off the ground is a substitute for performance??!!  Is a testosterone image all that important?  What happened to independent thought and logic?

If one wants comfort, handling, carrying capacity, 4-wheel drive - consider a Suburu Legacy Wagon, Camry All Trac Wagon or the Volvo Sport Wagon.  I think they are much better vehicles and values.  If you are young and single and the back seats are seldom used or for short trip around town and you have a need to keep up with your peers, maybe an SUV in this size group makes weird, masochistic sense.

No, I'm not a nerd or a prude and have nothing against having fun.  I did enjoy checking out the handling on a large empty gravel construction lot and some gravel roads.  I've ridden dirt bikes, driven up to 10 ton lorries in the military, held a novice SCCA race certificate, participated in road rallies and one autocross, so I'm not a stranger to motor vehicles.  But this makes no sense to me at all since only about 5% of all SUVs are ever driven off-road.  

Here are the specifics for the QX4 - Bad stuff first:

  No interior aircraft-type reading lights so common on luxury vehicles - a major issue for my wife who likes to read even at night (a moot point for this vehicle - see note below).
  Front cup holders are awkward for driver to use.
  Ride is so choppy at freeway speeds, passengers cannot read newspaper or books.
  Seats are comfortable but lack leg room for 4 adults - results in sore backs on long drives.
  No road feel in steering and variable power assist results in vague, mushy, wandering characteristic at freeway speeds - fine for around town.
  High drag coefficient and heavy weight results in poor gas mileage and makes straight tracking stability a challenge in high or gusty cross winds.
  Lacks luggage space - can't carry 4 large pullman suitcases hidden from view.
  Anemic acceleration, labors up long uphill grades.
  There is a pronounced left/rear blind spot making left lane changes dangerous.
  Gas mileage sucks - 17 mpg in flat country, 15 mpg (in 2-wheel drive mode) through the mountains; our Camry averages 34 mpg; Acura averages 29 mpg, both inmuch better comfort.
  Extra height makes entry/exit to/from vehicle an effort.
  No glove box light.
  No memory for the electric driver's seat adjustments.
  You pay a lot extra for the Infinity name - this is just an options loaded Pathfinder.

Now, the good stuff:

  Great Bose Stereo w/ 6-CD changer - really deep, firm, tight bass with no buzzy or boominess to it; good highs and mids, too.
  Very smooth auto transmission, works well in all modes - 2-wheel, 4-wheel auto, 4W-hi and 4W-lo; no surging or lunging during gear changes.
  Auto 4-Wheel mode works well on slick or gravel road surfaces.
  Weight distribution for cornering in 2-wheel drive mode is fairly predictable - easy to control on gravel roads using throttle to control under/oversteer.
  Brakes are great - easy to modulate and pedal does not kick hard during ABS use.
  Good, short turning radius - fairly nimble for around town maneuverability.
  Large, heated, remotely controlled side mirrors.
  Built-in fog lamps.
  Climate control worked very well and quietly.
  Windshield wipers were silent - no mechanical click at end of each travel direction.
  Compass and ambient air temperature/ice alert thermometer worked well.
  Sunroof is quiet in both retracted or tilt-up ventilation position.
  Fit and Finish is very good - on a par with other quality Japanese brands.
  Engine is smooth and quiet except when more power is needed - that happens a lot.
  Lots of small interior storage bins, slots and compartments.
  Good analog instrument panel - easy to read and intuitive controls to go along with them.
  Remote key entry/alarm system works well.
  Retracting Tonneau Cover is easy to use to hide luggage items behind back seats.
  Luggage rack is easy to adjust and use.
  Smooth Cruise Control, cannot be engaged below 30 mph; maintains its set-speed memory until ignition switch is   turned off; has temporary cancellation button.

That's my take on this vehicle and the type in general.  

I also believe they are prone to rollover in high speed emergency maneuvers as reported by 20/20 and 60 Minutes news exposes.  They can be dangerous to the unsuspecting and inexperienced.

 Sorry that I am going against the grain of public opinion on this one!
