            I bought my Lebaron because it was a sharp looking, new for 1987 Car.

This vehicle has turned into one of the most dependable cars I have ever owned.

I can't say I haven't repaired anything, but most of what was done is normal wear items on a vehicle with 107,000 miles on it.

Most major costs have been due to, my now 19 year old son and immovable objects likes trees and tall curbs.
 
My son uses this old Lebaron Coupe to commute between our home and his college every weekend, a 200 mile round trip.

It is still quiet at highway speeds few rattles and when pushed still go 125 mph safely.

I recommend this vehicle to anyone who needs inexpensive, dependable transportation that is built like a small tank.

I say this because my kid drove the car home from both accidents, one of which sent it airborne 3 feet, drove the right wheel assembly back 3 inches and under 4 inches so it drove on the sidewall of the tire on his way home.
