            I recently purchased the 2000 Toyota 4 Runner Sr5 V6 Automatic after much debate.  I previously leased a 1997 Nissan Pathfinder SE and loved it!  The ride was comfortable, decent acceleration, and the BOSE sound system was amazing!  I would have purchased another Pathfinder except I had a bad lease experience with Nissan Motor Acceptance Corp.  So, I turned to Toyota because I trusted them, great resale, and I have driven Toyota in the past.  The 4 Runner is very similar in size to the Pathfinder and I LOVE the way it looks!  It has a larger &quot;trunk&quot; area.  Acceleration is adequate although I think it could be more powerful, I sometimes have to floor it on hills.  The heater is a bit noisy.  The cd/cassette/radio is adequate (hard to compare with the Bose system in the Pathfinder).  I like the running day lights.  The fog lights come in very handy at nights.  Turns sharp.  Ride is comfortable.  I feel very secure in this SUV.  For the great resale and Toyota name- I am a proud owner of my Toyota 4 Runner.<br><br>
