            Man I tell you what, this car is sweet. I don't even care if it is 9 years old, the body is still straight. The seats can twist and contort into all sorts of cool positions. Everyone from myself (5'7&quot;) to my large friends (6'3&quot;-6'6&quot;) can easily fit in the front seats with a couple pulls of a lever (driver and passenger).

The interior is all moo-cow leather (some imitation in places like the doors). This means no itchy cloth or sticking to vinyl when it gets all hot and nasty like it does constantly during the summer. (That's why they call it 'Sunny' California.

Five of the six windows are tinted giving it a real 'pimp-daddy' look. It's stylish without saying &quot;Hey! Look at me! I'm an obnoxiously trendy MOFO with too much money on my hands&quot;. Well maybe I do have the money... but that's a different story.

I must say that it is also one of the fastest cars I have ever been in. I have driven a 6-cylinder Fiero, but is shook violently at high-speed.
