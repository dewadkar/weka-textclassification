            If you're in the market for a top quality digital camera this is the one. As a former owner of Nikon's earlier model, the Coolpix 900, I find the 950 to have a number of worthwhile improvements. The most significant improvement is in image quality and storage as well as the ability to use the camera equally well as a point and shoot and for professional applications. No other camera on the market has the versatility, control and power of the 950. Nikon also supports the best technical resource forum I've come across. The forum is moderated and is a great place to learn the ins and outs (as well as pros and cons) of this extremely sophisticated high-end digicam.

Easy interface to a Mac and flawless transfer with a powerbook equipped with a PCMCIA slot.

Battery life best with Energizer Lithium but also works very well with rechargeable Nickel-Metal
Hydride cells. Don't even think about using alkalines!

Its ease of use allows both beginners and professionals the opportunity to take high quality images without spending more than ten minutes reading the manual. Since I began using digital cameras a year ago I have taken more pictures (some worth keeping and. . . some not!) in one year than in the last five years combined. This is the camera to acquire if you want ease of use, supreme image quality and excellent technical support!

Nikon also has completed one firmware upgrade for this camera and will undoubtedly offer another which will improve (and fix a couple of software issues) an already great product.

If this sounds hyped, let me assure you it is simply my enjoyment of this camera. I love it!
