            I went car hunting one Saturday afternoon with my girlfriend to find her a potential car. After test driving Civics and even a base Camaro, we walked over to the Hyundai area of the dealership. We had heard about a big savings deal that was going on at the time, and wanted to check out what was on the lot. We were quickly greeted by an eager salesman, and he started his spill about the 2002 Hyundai Sonata.

"This thing looks like a Mercedes in the front, and a Jaguar in the back!" exclaims the salesman. That was one thing I agreed with him about. I also think the front can slightly resemble a Lexus with the way the headlights are configured, and it definitely does have the curves of a Jaguar in the back. Then, sales pitch after sales pitch about safety features, warranty, blah blah (I guess you can probably tell that I wasnt too impress with this salesman).

Enough about the salesman, here is my take on the car. The exterior is definitely easy on the eyes, with premium level styling. It is definitely a whole lot better looking than its 2001 models. The engine in the model we test drove was their 2.4L 4-cyl engine, in which all the fluid caps are easy to see along with easy access to the battery. You will find that Hyundai cars all are configured this way.

The interior is also nice to look at. The instruments were laid out well, along with the middle console. My only suggestion for changing the interior is to not make the middle area bulge out as much. Other than that, I think Hyundai did a good job with their new design.

Ok, now for the drive. I was quickly impressed with how smooth and quite the four cylinder engine was! It did not feel like a 4-banger at all. The motor provided above average power throughout the powerband, and this engine is mated to a shiftronic automatic transmission, which you get on all Hyundai models with auto. I admit, the shiftronic was definitely a little more fun to play with in the Sonata, as compared to the Santa Fe I test drove not long ago. The car's handling was not bad, either. It had a certain tightness about it, but still rode like a passenger car.

I still need to mention that all these cars come with the 5yr/60000 mile bumper to bumper warranty, and a 10yr/100000 mile powertrain warranty. The price on these cars is an unbelievable value: MSRP is around $16,000 for the base models, with $18,000 for the loaded version V6.

I havent test driven the V6, but there is supposed to be a 30hp difference in the motors. However, the same V6 is also available in the Santa Fe, and that motor was much noisy than the 4-cyl. Other features you can get on the Sonata are power everything, wood trim interior, and even leather.

The only main concern about this car I have is will it retain its value and be as reliable as the huge warranty proclaims? Only time will tell on that one. However, in the present, this car is a heck of a buy, and gives luxury like features and performance that can rival cars twice as much in price. Two thumbs up on this ride!
