            My first car was a 95 Mirage. I have only the fondest memories of it. The Mirage is what a mechanic buddy of mine calls a runabout. It's not overly imbued with style or outrageous comfort, but it will get you from point A to point BE safely and reliably. I think it was the best choice I could have made as a 16 year old leadfoot with nothing for money. It served me faithfully for two and a half years until I decided to upgrade to an Eclipse.

For a car with no amenities (manual doors and windows and such) the Mirage had an incredibly comfortable interior. To use the cliche it fit like a glove. There is plenty of legroom not only for the driver and the passenger but also for the back seat passengers. The cloth seats were very durable and easy to clean. The wheel and pedals are within easy reach for anybody and there are enough pockets and niches to store change and other necessary evils drivers have to put up with. The factory tape deck was very decent (although the speakers needed work) and the acoustics in the passenger compartment use the limited stereo output to great effect (for those of you who like it loud). I guess I was lucky enough to have a car with AC for that price but that worked great too, no complaints.

The Mirage has enough power to propel itself at highway speeds, but not for overly aggressive drivers. The best part about it is that not only does it average around 35 city miles per gallon, it will also run on kerosene (figuratively speaking of course). For over 2 years, I filled up with 87 octane gas, and the day I sold it, it ran as smoothly as the day I bought it. It's also incredibly forgiving to lack of maintenance. 5K oil changes will keep it running like a clock, I should know.

The Mirage is also sporty-looking. That means that if kept clean and tidy, it looks impressive enough to be a decent car for a teen. The rear spoiler is a wonderful factor for that purpose.

Another selling point is the low cost of repair. For example, the class of tires required for the car is one of the least pricey ones around. Parts are also comparatively cheap, and being Mitsubishi factory replacement parts, completely reliable.

As a final testament to the powers of the Mirage, here is the sad ending to my Mirage story. I sold my beloved white 95 ES two years ago. At the time of sale, the car had been in 3 accidents that I know of, was missing both bumpers and a blinker. and it still ran like a Swiss clock and fetched me 3K from a private party buyer. On the brighter side, owning the Mirage as my first car, made a die-hard Mitsubishi fan out of me.
