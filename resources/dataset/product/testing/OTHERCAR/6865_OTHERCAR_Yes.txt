            A few months ago, I figured it was time to start shopping for a new car. And I came across Hyundai. A co-worker of mine had recently bought a Hyundai Sonata and he told me about the great warranty Hyundai has now.
  I went looking around to several places, and then decided to take a good look into Hyundai vehicles. I wanted a somewhat smaller car. And I saw the Elantra and really liked the looks of it. Immediately went and test drove the car and was immediately sold on it.
  It is a sporty looking compact vehicle, that rides very smooth and quiet. The price was right and the warranty Hyundai has is excellent. They give you a 10 year warranty on the power train with 5 years bumper to bumper. 
   This is a great deal for someone buying their kids their first car, and if you are looking for a economical, yet sporty looking family car this is the perfect choice. <br><br>
