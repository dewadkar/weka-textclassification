            This is the fourth SUV we have purchased. We started out with a GMC Jimmy in the late 80's followed by two Chevy Blazer's in 1993 &amp; 1996. The 1998 Mercury Mountaineer is by far the best SUV we've owned. The 4 doors, hood and rear door fit perfectly and are solid. The exterior paint (dark blue over gray) is flawless. The interior is free of squeaks; the leather seats very comfortable (and cool in the summer), and there's plenty of head and leg room if you happen to be tall. The V-8 engine is quiet and powerful and my wife absolutely loves the ABS (Anti-Lock Braking System) and AWD in the winter (Full Time All Wheel Drive - no buttons to push or levers to shift). Ours is equipped with a host of standard features and luxury appointments (Leather, cruise, tilt, power windows, power door locks, power tailgate, keyless entry and remote entry, fog lights, overhead console, am/fm/cassette/disk, power outlets, dual airbags w/side impact beams and more)and worth every penny more than the Explorer. Everything has operated as advertised and gas mileage is as expected for the V-8. It handles very nicely and is remarkable easy to park for a vehicle that has &quot;bigger&quot; feel. One last little thing - it has rear seat A/C &amp; heat and separate volume controls for rear seat radio headsets which are very useful for passengers. <br><br>
