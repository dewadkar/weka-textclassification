            i own an 83 supra and it is the coolest and funest car. it has an inline 6 cyl with a 2.8 litre engine, gets 20-25 miles per gallon and has excellent ecceleration, this also comes in a turbo model that boasts 232 hoarse power at four thousand rotarions per minute and comes stock with extra wide 15&quot; aluminum rims. If you are considering buying one of these fine import autos than i think you have made a wise choice. You can also join SOGI, a supra owners club, in which you get discounts at hundreds of toyota dealerships and performance parts retailers nationwide! Also i have heard of many supras running for as long as 270,000 miles! without and major mechanical repair, take care of it and it will laast you a lifetime!<br><br>
