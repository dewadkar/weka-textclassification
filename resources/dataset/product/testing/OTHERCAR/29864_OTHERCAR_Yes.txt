            I've been purchasing the Kodak line of digital cameras since their early 190 series (if I recall the model # correctly). It was bulky and very low resolution. But still I was a pioneer and moving to make a mark in the digital world.

I've since upgraded almost every 18 months to the next model and have stopped at the 265. Why? Because, now there are other options besides Kodak once you get to the 3+ MB pixel range.

First, the 265 is a solid built camera and you should be able to get one for less than $500. I've been very happy with it except for ONE BIG COMPLAINT - BATTERY LIFE!. It's true what everyone's written about the camera, the various features, etc.. but the battery life is short. Invest in recharable LI-Ions.

<B>Future purchase for me:</B>
I'm now considering the upgrade to the 3+MB pixel market. I'm looking to spend another $1K to get ahead of the curve. So, I'm looking at the successor to the Sony DCP1. It should be arriving in the stores late March.

I've decided to get away from Kodak b/c the other manufacturers have caught up with Kodak and simply offer a better product. Take a look at the reviews on the Nikons as well as the Sony.

Good luck in your purchase.
