            I purchased the DC 25 several years ago when it was the first consumer lined DC that had an LCD screen.

<b>It's Pros</b>
This Camera will mostly be very cheap to get by now. It is extremely simple to use, a great camera to pass down to your parents if their somewhat computer literate.
I've found that the best feature of this camera would be the ease of use, because it came out before many of the features available on newer DCs had come out.
If your looking for a bottom end of the line camera just to take pictures for email only, this camera is a good one for you.
It also accepts compact flash and due to it's low resolution it would fit incredible amounts of pictures on one.

<b>It's Cons</b>
And there's a lot of them now...
The worst quality about this camera is the extremely low resolution of pictures it works *alright* for emailing them and Internet work, but as soon as you print them you discover the poor quality.
All the pictures have added colors to them, a little green begins to show up everywhere. Now this is something that Photoshop can help a great deal on minimizing, but even then you can't get rid of it.
The LCD works well and does allow you to view live feed through it, but it has an extremely slow refresh rate.
The baterries are also a major drawback, it uses 1.5 volt lithium to which costs $15 each time they run out...however they do last much longer then today's DCs. I found 3 or 4 days of full use, 2 weeks-3 months of average use.
Lastly, there are very few features with this camera, it's basically a cheap 35mm regular camera but digitized. So about the only things you can do is view, delete, change resolution from low to high and switch the flash from Auto to Fill or Off (it does not have Red Eye).

<b>In Conclusion</b>
This camera would work for only a specific type of person.
If you only want to email friends or family and quality doesn't matter and if your on a limited budget then this could be the camera for you. But I would advise if you do have a bit more money, then I really would suggest looking for a higher quality Camera.<br><br>
