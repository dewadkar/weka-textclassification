            I recently bought the 2000 Chevy Impala LS --- it has a great profile --- the familiar Impala marque on the rear door coupled with the Impala LS inscription on the lower front door panels gives the car a terrific European look.  It handles great in traffic and the 3800 engine gives the car enough pick up ---even in NYC city driving conditions --- to get on highways without too much difficulty.

The new Impala comes with enough options to keep everyone happy but doesn't overload --- if you're looking for separate bass, treble, balance and fade controls --- because you're &quot;knob happy&quot; --- forget it --- it's all in one convenient location.  I especially like the heated seats --- an option --- but well worth it.  It keeps you warm while you wait for the rest of the car to warm up --- and since I don't live in Las Vegas anymore --- this is important, because I've forgotten how long it takes for the average car to &quot;warm up&quot; -- both figuratively and literally in the winter.

The car was under $24,000 loaded with seemingly every possible available option.  It gets great stares from everyone and is well worth the price.  On a recent road trip I averaged almost 30mpg (when traffic thinned out enough to use the Cruise Control.  I'm in my early 40's and for anyone around our age who needs four doors --- more room than we used to need, but still want to make an impression without spending a fortune --- this is one great car.

The pass through afforded by fold down seats in the rear also means huge potential cargo space for skis or fishing poles --- wish I did either one --- but I do like the big trunk --- it held several suitcases and lots of souvenir bags without even trying.

I kept hoping that GM would make something with style to keep up with Chrysler --- it doesn't have the awe-inspiring look of the LHS or the 300M but it's still distinctive and is quite a bit cheaper --- add my $2,000 rebate from my GM Mastercard --- and this car was a bargain.

Enjoy the ride.
