            I lease the Acura CL Type S back in December of 2000.  My first impression of the CL was impressive.  As time went by, the CL was actually a great disappointment.  The first thing I noticed was that the Bose system has no sound quality at all.  The biggest problem of the system was no bass.  I was wondering if that sound system was really a Bose.  I can say the CL can be a dangerous car to drive.  The VSA function does not work at all.  Several times the VSA has worked against and almost got me into a major accident.  This happens whenever I drive on a curvy road.  If you go too fast, the VSA will brake on you.  Instead of braking gently, it brakes very aggressively.  It made swerve back and forth for a couple of seconds and then it stops.  It had gotten so bad that I had to turn off the VSA function everytime I drive.  The CL lack many functions that a luxury car should have.  Even the simplest function like folding rear seats that the CL lacks.  Another problem are the factory wheels.  These wheels scratches very easily if you bring it to the car wash.  It looked like paint chipping off.  As for the Michellen tires, poor quality also.  If you hit a pothole, even the ones that are not deep at all, the tire will be history.  You will either get a blowout or a huge bubble.  The delivery of the vehicle was poor.  There was already a dent on the roof and the passenger seat had a unremovable black spot.  

The only positive thing I had to say about the CL is the design of the exterior and interior are great.  But for the overall performance, a great disappointment.
