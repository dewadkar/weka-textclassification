                I have bought 9 new GM cars including four Buick Park Avenues, '87, '94, '97 and '00. Unfortunately, the '97 was a better car than the 2000.
Pros of the 2000 (and the '97): Very roomy, great trunk space, excellent     ride, good handling, same excellent highway mileage as previous PAs.
Cons:  According to the dealer where I complained, the transmission whine     is normal and the very poor quality cruise control is also normal,     i.e. as Buick designed it.  (Apparently, REDESIGNED it.)
    Most of my travel is on major highways--mostly interstate.  While traveling through Virginia on I-81, the cruise control drove me nuts.  When set at 65, it was fine on the level.  But uphill or downhill it consistently either dropped 2 mph or gained 2-3 mph.  If you are in traffic where others with quality cruise controls are &quot;on cruise&quot;, they will be forced to pass you on the uphill, and you will pass them on the downhill.  Of course, if there is traffic in the left lane, then you have to disengage the cruise to keep from bumping the car ahead.  This cruise is the poorest that ever came on any of my new car purchases.
    If you use the cruise control a lot, don't buy this car.  If a poor cruise control and noisy transmission don't bother you, the car has many other fine features.
