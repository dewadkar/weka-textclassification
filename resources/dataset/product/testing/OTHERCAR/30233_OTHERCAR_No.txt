            This camera is not worth anything to me, much less the $89.95 I paid for it. Like others who have purchased this camera, it was my first, and I wanted a simple, inexpensive digital camera to send occasional pictures by email. A very simple wish, I thought.

When I saw the first pictures I took - simple ones, of my apartment - my first thought was that I must have received a defective product. They were so fuzzy, so snowy, so filled with vertical lines, and so awful (there's no other word for it) that I thought this can't be the way it's supposed to be. In addition, the battery indicator kept alternating from Full to Almost Empty, even with 2 entirely new sets of batteries in there.

I knew this would have to go back for a refund, but just to be sure, I contacted Agfa support and explained the problem. They reminded me (thank you very much) that the eSmile is a low resolution camera aimed at the beginner digital camera user. They forgot to mention that the user must also be half-blind in order to find it acceptable. They asked me to send them sample photos, and I will update with their response as soon as I get it.

I also tried taking more pictures, in different ways, to see if I could get anything at all out of this camera. I discovered that if I took the pictures from 3-6 feet away from the subject and I had EXTREMELY bright light, they looked okay. If this is the only way the eSmile can produce a useable picture, it is almost useless to me, since I do not live in a portrait studio but rather, in the real world.

I do not recommend this camera under any circumstances but here is a quick rundown of some of the features:

Good: *Simple to operate
      *Comes with a video cable so pictures can be viewed quickly and
       easily on your TV
      *Small and portable

Bad:  *Batteries do not last long and it doesn't come with an adapter
      *Serial connection to PC makes for slow downloading of pictures
      *2MB storage capacity (16 pics) is not enough
      *Poor photo quality unless you live in a photographer's studio world

Update: Here is Agfa's response to my inquiry:
