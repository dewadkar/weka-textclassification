               The 2000 Celica. What a looker. When the time came for me to get a new car once I saw this one the choice was much easier.
   First things first, this car looks great!!! It is so sporty looking but not over the top. Compact yet not as cramped as most cars of this style tend to be. It is simply pleasing to the eye and anyone and everyone will ask you about it.
   The Celica drives like a dream. It is fast but safe and secure. Very smooth acceleration and rides very well. You almost feel like your floating on air. Most cars that sit so low to the ground, I have found to be a rather bumpy ride but not this one. This car is a dream to drive. 
   The interior is lovely. Just as pleasing as the outside. Sleek and aero dynamic. My Celica has the sun roof which is an added bonus. Not only does it add to the cars decor but it also is great to pop open on beautiful days.
   I would say this car is great for anyone. Young people enjoy the attention and older people enjoy feeling young again. This is truly a great car and I would recommend it to you!<br><br>
