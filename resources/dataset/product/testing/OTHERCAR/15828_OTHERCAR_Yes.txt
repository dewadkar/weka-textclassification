            I have had my Solara for about a year now and I look forward to driving it every single day!  After looking at several other vehicles in the same price range and doing research on the 'net, I concluded that the Solara had so much more to offer for a vehicle in the low $20K range that I just had to check it out.  My local dealer had only 3...and all three were out on test drives the day I visited the dealership.  I went over the Honda dealer to check out the V6 Accord coupe and drove that but wasn't too pleased with the clunky shifting and limited backseat room.

The following week, I went to another toyota dealer in a nearby city and drove the Solara.  It was so smooth, quiet and felt so luxurious!  I was sold immediately. 

If you're ready to move up into a more expensive ride, but want something that looks different from all of the other cars on the road, this car is for you.  I still feel a sense of pride when I drive it, and I have had many comments from friends/family when they ride in it with me that they are very impressed by how quiet it is.<br><br>
