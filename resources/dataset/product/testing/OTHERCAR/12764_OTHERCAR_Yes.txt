            I purchased my 1993 Dodge Stealth due to the fact that I at times can thrive on attention. In which this car gave me and still does.  The other reason is the very intense competition I have with my twin sister.  In which we tend to try to out do each other in many  area's.  Such as who has the fastest car, who's looks the sleekest, this competition is not only in cars its in clothes, men, and many other categories as well.  

My choice with the Stealth has been an excellent choice she has a Corvette in which the Stealth has often taken the lead as far as its quickness.  As well as its mechanical stability and the list goes on and on as to how outstanding it is!

I bought it two years old in which I have no regrets in purchasing this car.  It has been worth every penny I paid for it in which I believe I paid $22,000.00 for it.  The insurance can be a little high due to the fact that its a sports car but its still with in reason. 

The only other thing I was surprised about was that your only allowed to put premium gas in the car which has not  turned out to be bad at all.  I usually get about 400 in town miles per 20 gallons.  So it all works out about the same.

I often say my car looks like me because its small in the front and big in the back.  You don't often find a car that has features like its owner.  Not to mention its beauty right? 'wink'

The Stealth has surpassed all my expectations of a vehicle!  I have maybe put $1000.00 into it and that includes a set of new tires (in which that was the majority of my expense), a new ignition, and then a few oil changes here and there which if you know me you know I'm a typical lady as long as it has gas then thats all I worry about. 

 Just to give you an idea in the 6 years that i've owned the car I may have given it an oil change 7-8 times. It now has 90,000 miles and is still in excellent running condition.  The car still has all its original parts with the exception of the tires and the ignition switch.   And doesn't require a tune up until 100,00.00 miles.  So could you ask for a better car?  I think not!  Its definitely a ladies car!

I personally highly recommend this car to everyone.  Especially those ladies out there who thrive on attention in all area's of their lives this is the car.  And then if you want a low maintenance car so you can spend the rest of your money showing off the rest of your assets then this is the car!


In final I highly recommend this car it is well built, low maintenance, extremely fast and a beautiful car to drive in.  I have no negative comments in regards to this beauty.  With the exception of the back seats not really built for adults.  Other than that its a wonderful vehicle to have!!!
