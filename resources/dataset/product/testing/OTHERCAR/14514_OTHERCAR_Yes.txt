            The RAV4 is a great car but if you're buying a used 1996 make sure that the recall work to the front differential has been done or at least checked for damage. Toyota issued a recall notice to all known owners about a year ago asking them to come into a local dealer and have the differential checked for abnormal wear. The incorrect manufacturing of some axle seals apparently caused this. Symptoms were described as being anything from loosing some acceleration power to not being able to even move off from a standing start.

I'd noticed that my RAV4 was particularly slow on the uptake, especially when turning right, up a hill from a standing start and sure enough according to the Toyota repair man my differential was down to its last few teeth and it was a good job I had it fixed. $4,000 of free warranty work and a day later I had a brand-new differential installed and now I must say my RAV4 is decidedly perky! Big thanks to Toyota for owning up to the manufacturing mistake and getting it all fixed in a very professional way.

So, if you're buying a used 1996 RAV4 ask the owner if they had that recall notice and if the work was done. Even if it wasn't and you have a problem it might still be possible to have it fixed.

In addition to all of that, here's my opinion on the car:

If you're used to driving small, European or Japanese cars you'll notice the similarity in feel to the RAV4 - firm and responsive. It also turns extremely tightly and can be parked virtually anywhere.

The four-wheel drive is well worth getting if you live in a snowy climate or think you might drive in sand somehow. The RAV has very little problem with either of those hazards but I have had it almost bottom out once in snow - it's a higher clearance than a car but not that high. If you can afford the ABS I'd recommend you get it for icy conditions. I don't have it and once or twice skidded a little too far even though I've been pumping the brakes. However, the times that I'm most glad to have my RAV4 is when it snows because I know I'll have very little problem getting home (I live in Colorado).

Tall people (over 6'2&quot;) should avoid the manual RAV4 and the 2 door. There is not enough legroom for the driver. I rented a manual for a week and almost crippled my back from the contortions required! I own an automatic and have no such problems with that.

The worst problem I've had with the RAV, baring the recall is with the tires - the factory Dunlop tires wore out within 20,000 miles. But if you're considering a '96 you shouldn't have that problem!

One of the best things about the RAV4 is the high headroom. The trunk can easily swallow large boxes (Webber Grill, lawnmowers etc.) whole.

I firmly recommend the RAV4 for fun driving and safety. I just wish it didn't cost so much!
