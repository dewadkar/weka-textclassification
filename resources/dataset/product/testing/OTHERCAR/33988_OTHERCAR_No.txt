            I bought a Jamcam Jr. a few months ago simply because of the price. I needed something just for my on-line auctions so I could make more money. 

 I was somewhat pleased with this camera but it does not take good pictures in the house. For your pictures to come out well you need to be outside and in good sunlight. It only stores up to six pictures at a time and it's much like using a 110 camera. You really have to focus or else half of your picture won't come out. 
 
 The price was under $50.00 so that was a plus and it is very easy to use. The camera comes with a Microsoft picture it '99 cd rom and great instructions. I would recommend this to any one who is trying to get there on-line auctions started but I would not recommend it for family pictures. If the pictures are to far back or to up close they come out blurry. 
 
 Overall it wasn't a total waste of money but if you are going to invest in a digital camera for all kinds of picture taking this is not the one to get! I guess that's why they call it the Jamcam Jr.!<br><br>
