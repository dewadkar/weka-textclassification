            I purchased a 1999 Chevy Silverado in January of '99. It is a 1500 extended cab, 4X4, w/ Z71 package, almost fully loaded. It is now December and I have over 41,000 miles on it. The truck has great power and it pulls 3 or 4 four wheelers on a 25' trailer with ease. The truck is going to the shop for the 5th time. They have put 4 front diff. seals in it, both ext. cab widows were replaced, the drivers power window boke and the window fell into the door. The pass. door leaks both air and water and the dealership has &quot;adjusted&quot; 4 times and it is not any better. My odometer and gear indicator went out and they replaced the display. My dash pad was replaced because the paint or dye would come off on your hand. There  is a rattle and a rubbing sound coming from the rear end of the truck that everyone, except the dealer, can hear. The steering colum or something in the steering box rattles and sounds like it is going to fall apart. My drivers seat track broke. I am a Hard Core Chevy fan and i am very disapointed that my $30,000+ dollar truck is a piece of junk!!!!! The dealership continues to &quot;look at it&quot; an nothing gets fixed!!! I would wait a few years before buying a new Silverado, let them work out the bugs.<br><br>
