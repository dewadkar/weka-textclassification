            In the past five years, I have owned a Ford Aerostar, a Ford conversion van, a Chevy Venture, a Ford Windstar, and now a Plymouth Grand Voyager.  Without a doubt, I recommend the Plymouth Grand Voyager over and above any of the other mentioned vans I have owned.  

First, the price was perfect for our budget.  Second, this van has lived up to every claim made by the dealership during the selection process.  

I purchased this van in November of 1999. I just returned from a trip to Florida and I cannot stop raving about the way the van handled during the trip.  With most vehicles I have owned, when the speed reaches 50 and above, a shimmy starts in the front end.  This van doesn't get a shimmy until it reaches 75-80 miles an hour (legal speed limits in the south) and then it is so slight that it in no way affects the driving ability of the van.

I was told it would get 18 miles a gallon around town and 20 miles a gallon over the road.  It has been averaging 19.2 miles around town and 21.3 over the road.  The four captain's chairs or bucket seats in the van must have been ergonomically designed for total comfort, whether driving, riding, or sleeping.  As the primary driver, I can honestly say that I was never uncomfortable while driving even after 3 to 4 hours without stopping. 

I recommend this vehicle to families, couples, or anyone who wants value, comfort, and reliability.<br><br>
