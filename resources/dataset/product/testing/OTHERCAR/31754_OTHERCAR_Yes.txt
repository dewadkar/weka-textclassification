            Here is my epinion about my BMW 323I 1999 model after driving 8000+ miles (I will try to stay away from factual numbers that car sales person can give you at the dealers.  Instead, I will try to provide you what I really think about the vehicle):

<b>PROS:</b>
<b>Handling.</b>  Handling is absolutely awesome.  Once, I was driving 90+ mph on I40.  All of sudden a roadrunner appeared middle of no where.  It was on a suicide mission or maybe chased by a coyote.  It ran straight towards the driver side door.  I swerved (keep in mind that I was driving 90+ mph) to right side of the road to dodge the roadrunner, but unfortunately, it went under neat my car and � I was so amazed how well the car handled that sudden jerk I made in such a high speed.  I just kept on driving as if nothing ever happened.  I know that if I was in my old Honda Accord or Acura Integra, I won�t be writing this review right now.

<b>Interior Design.</b>  I really love how they redesigned the famous BMW Cockpit like driver seat.  Gives you more legroom and looks more spacious than before and yet it still gives you that &quot;I am in the cockpit of F-15&quot; feeling.  Also, Love the fact that I can choose High-Gloss Finish instead of Myrtle Wood Trim around the dash and doors.  Sports cars and Wood Trims just don�t mix that well.  Best of all, I really appreciate how BMW added multi-function steering wheel: Now you can control the radio and CD player at your fingertips.

<b>Sound System.</b>  I highly recommend upgrading the stock stereo system to Harman-Kardon sound system.  It comes with 12 speakers including 2 subwoofers: Do not under estimate the power of these subwoofers.  They are small (located in the trunk), but powerful.  It will not shake your neighbor�s kitchen table, but it will rock your ears!  Get it!  It�s worth it!!!

<b>0-60mph.</b>  I know that everyone loves to read about this number, and so do I.  I can tell you, yes, it is fast, but obviously, it is no McLaren F1; however, you can still take 0 to 60 mph in 7.1 seconds according to BMW North America.  I never timed it myself, so I am not sure how true that is, but when I need to take left turn on those yellowish red lights, it never have failed me, so you can say that I am happy with its acceleration.

<b>Xenon Headlights.</b>  Another must have item.  You will not appreciate what these lights can do for you until you see them yourself.  Trust me, it's awesome.

<b>CONS:</b>
<b>Costs.</b>  I bought my first BMW because I can afford it, but I do think that the price is bit too high.  I could have appreciate little more if the price was few thousand $$$ lower.  But don�t get me wrong here, I still love the car and you will get your money�s worth.

<b>Room.</b>  This is something they are very lack of, but then again, what do you expect when you purchase a sports car, right?  The front two seats are as comfortable as they can be.  It has 10 way adjustable sports seats, so you can adjust to fit your taste or height for that matter.  However, the back seats is not as impressive as the front seats.  Still very comfortable, but because they are lack of their legroom, I would definitely call �shot-gun� for a road trip.
