            The G1 3.3 Megapixel camera is a nice upgrade to the Pro70, but the G1 has its problems. I've owned the Canon Powershot G1 for about 2 weeks, and previously have owned the Canon Pro70 for 6 months. (See my other review about the Pro70 vs the Nikon 950).  

What I liked about the G1:
--------------------------
(+) QUALITY: SHARP SHARP SHARP! Like the Pro70, the G1 sports a sharp lens. What makes the G1 even sharper is Canon's addition to a digital equivalent to ISO 50 fine grained film. WOW is all I could say!

(+) LCD: The flip-out LCD is excellent for taking shots at extreme angles. Usually, you would have to crouch down to get a low angle shot, but the LCD allows you to twist it so you can look down at your composition. The Pro70 had the same flip-out LCD feature.

(+) SHOOT LIKE A PRO: The manual features make the G1 SLR-like. With pro-like features such as auto-bracketing, exposure-lock, flash exposure control, what more can you ask for? The hot-shoe on the camera allows you to take high-quality flash photos. I use the Canon 380ex flash, and the quality is amazing compared to an on-board flash. 

(+) JUST POINT AND SHOOT - EVEN MY GRANDMA CAN USE IT : And you don't have to be a pro to use the camera. Set the camera to auto-mode, and it becomes a nice point-and shoot camera. The LCD is also nicely hidden, and you wouldn't even know it's a digital camera.

(+) FORM FACTOR: It's small, but not too small -- easy to hold. It doesn't have that weird camera twist like the Nikon 950/990. A hot-shoe is on the camera if you want to add an external flash. The LCD is self protecting (twist it to cover the LCD, twist it 180 degrees to use it). Canon thought of everything.

(+) LONG BATTERY LIFE: The Canon has incorporated a lithium-ion battery which allows you to take 200-300+ pictures per charge (depending on LCD use). Unlike the Pro70 however, the G1 camera kit does not come with a separate power charger adapter. You have to charge the battery in the camera. The power charger adapter the Canon sells is a car-charger/home-charger hybrid that sells for $200! Yikes. However, you can get a compatible charging device made by Lenmar that only costs $50.

(+) OTHER NOTEWORTHY FEATURES: Raw format, takes CF Type I and II, Spot Metering, Saturation control, Sharpness control, packaged remote control allows you to take pictures and flip through pictures when shown on a tv screen, macro mode, night mode, av priority, tv priority, p mode, panoramic stitch help mode, 30 second video mode, black and white mode.

What I disliked:
----------------
There are only a few things I disliked about the camera, but to me, they are important to list here...

(-) NO FILTER THREADS?? : Why Canon did not put filter threads on the lens boggles me. The lens is what brings light into your camera. Any dust, fingerprints, dirt, or scratches that go on your lens affects the image quality of your picture. A nice quality multi-coated filter costs about $30. The lenses on these cameras are probably 10x more expensive. I would recommend protecting the lens on any of your expensive cameras. To get a filter on this camera, you need to buy a Canon lens adapter that adds size to the camera. About 30% more size. I bought a smaller adapter by Lensmate that fits 49mm filters.

(-) FOCUS PROBLEMS: For some reason, at ranges of about 2-4 feet, the G1 has trouble focusing. It does not happen all the time, but it does happen. This is very disappointing, since you may want to get a shot that close, but find out later it is out of focus. A work-around would be using the manual focus until you get a sharp image. Judging whether the image is sharp on a small LCD though may be a hit or miss.

(-) ADAPTER INCOMPATIBILITY: I bought a lens adapter and a telephoto converter that allows me to zoom at ~150mm (vs ~100mm). The quality of the tele-converter is great, however using the adapter and converter blocks part of the focus assist light of the camera. The focus assist light helps the camera focus (yes, the F word again), on the subject at low-light. The Lensmate adapter blocks less of the focus assist light.

Bottomline: The G1's features and quality definitely outweigh its shortcomings. If you want a sharp, high-quality, portable camera, this is the best one to get. One of my favorite personal sites that gives good examples of pictures from the G1 is on http://studio-on-the.net, then click on G1 Photos.
