            For a vehicle that is so cheap, this compact car really performs well.  It looks great, has a relatively smooth ride, and it's maneuverability is wonderful.  It is great for any person on a budget that wants a nice car.  Compared to the other cars in its category it is the best.  I would know, I drove all the competitors when I bought the car.  The car is simple and fun to drive.  The engine is weak, but it can go when you step on the accelerator.  The turning is great and it is a joy to drive.  Unfortunately it is very low to the ground and light, so accidents and damage are easy to find.  I got into an accident earlier this year with this car, and even though it was a low speed crash the damage was extensive ($4000).  But I was not hurt and it is a safe car.  Overall I would recommend this car to new drivers and people looking for a nice loaded vehicle for about $15,000.<br><br>
