             I was on my way home when this car caught my eye sitting by the road of a car dealership.I did not know at the time I was going to be a proud owner of a Chysler Sebring Jxi convertible. I fell in love with this car at first sight. It stole my heart from the time I slide down in the driver�s seat. This was defiantly a dream come true. I am a previous owner of a 1994 Buick Skylark, which has been a great car. I have no complaints. After laying my eyes on this car, I felt it was time to reward my self with a newer car.
. 

I have always wanted a convertible as long as I can remember. I had no idea how much this car was. I just new it fit my personality and I had to have it. It is a very sleek car with fine lines and great curves. This car is very sporty but at the same time it is very luxury. It is all trimmed out in gold and is completely loaded. Just to look at the car it makes a statement. The car passed every expectation I was looking for. The second important test was,� how dose it drive and handle?� I did my test drive and was very impressed. It handled great. It hugged tight going around corners. It is quite but yet quick, it makes for a smooth fun in the sun ride.

I am very impressed with the push of the button and down goes the top. You have no hassle with taking the top up or down and it is not only easy but also quick. I also like that when the top is up the car looks just as equally great. This car gets 30mpg (Highway) and is worth every penny.

The Sebring Jxi is a sport coupe with great performance abilities and suave good looks. I do have to add this car is a little pricey but you get sporty with all the benefits of luxury. Power seats, cruise control, power windows, power top, front wheel drive just to name a few.

Extra comment: This car is not on the lemon list. All research done shows good reviews.
