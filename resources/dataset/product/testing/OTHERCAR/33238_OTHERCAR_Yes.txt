            I drive 600 miles a week and need a car that is comfortable, reliable and economical to run; I found all of this and more in my new Pontiac Sunfire.  Until now I had always owned midsized sedans with six cylinder engines.  When it was time to trade in my 98 Chevy Lumina I knew I needed to cut down on my gas costs and that would mean buying a smaller car.  I looked at Dodge Neons and also looked into the 4 cylinder Dodge Stratus.  Both were nice cars but didn't deliver the bang for the buck that the Sunfire did.  For a little over $15,000 I got a 2002 model with alot of options and a nice sound system.  My family of four was impressed with the amount of room in the Sunfire and with the comfortable ride it delivers.  

I spend at least 12 hours a week in my car and the Sunfire has turned that into a pleasant experience.  It has an excellent sound system with six speaker sound that makes even my kid's rap CD's sound good.  I've been pleasantly surprised by the amount of power the 2.2 Liter L4 Engine provides. It has plenty of get up and go to pull me out of tight spots while driving on the interstate.  

It is a smooth handling car with a nice solid feel.  I also like the red dashlights which are easy on the eyes at night and also easy to read.  The seats are comfortable and firm and I don't have that boxed in feeling you sometimes get when driving a small car.

So far I have no complaints with my purchase.  After comparing it to other cars I can't believe the great options I got at a great price.  I bought the car when factory discounts were being offered and got the Special Edition Package which includes 4 speed Automatic Transmission, CD Player, Security Package with keyless entry, Power Door Locks, Windows, and Mirrors, Cruise Control, Chrome Wheel Covers and P195/65R15 BSW Tires.  The Dodge Neon I looked at was only a 2001 stripped down model for the same price.  
 
I'm pleased to say I've cut my gas bill in half and have a smooth, sporty, quiet ride as well.
