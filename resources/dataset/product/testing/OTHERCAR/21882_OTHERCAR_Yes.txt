            GMC has been able to meet success in many categories.  With the 2000 Sierra Classic Crew Cab, it offers something to the working person.  There is no doubt that this truck makes a good work truck.  It is reliable and tough.  Let me add that this pickup is even more important if you are in the mood to play. The Sierra Classic Crew Cab will be in that play mode without any restraint.  

Last month, I spent a day with a dairy herdsman in his daily routine.  For this review, I will say that Dan owned a brand new 2000 GMC Sierra Classic.  He grew up a true cowboy who loves his animals.  Dan and I attended the same community college.  West Hills College.  The dude was a hero in town.  He knew his ways around a horse and calves.  West Hills was doing very well then.  The small community has a good history of producing great cowboys.  After receiving his degree in Animal husbandry and weed management, he got into business  with his parents and started moving his herds from one grazing area to the next.  This type of work is inherently difficult.  It can be even more difficult if you have a vehicle that is breaking down at every corner.  I ran into Dan again at the local rodeo organized in Clovis, CA.  All true cowboys know about this quaint, little Americana for its strong tradition to promoting a rough lifestyle.  Dan talked about some presentations at the Big Fresno Fair this year.

Dan transports his two horses in his trailer hooked to the Sierra. He only had room for one saddle in the back of the trailer.  He placed all of his other equipment in the back seats.  That's also where he took his nap between the shows.

For sure, such a guy makes this GMC Sierra Classic work for him.  

<b>What is this truck made of? Let's check it out now</b>

Depending on what you want, you will find out that the Sierra sports a 12-valve, OHV, 4.3 liter V6 engine.  Some of the options that are offered on all models are:  AM/FM stereo with CD, remote keyless entry, a six-way power driver's seat and heavy duty trailering equipment.  It a great heavy-duty battery, air conditioning, cruise control and more.

I recommend this truck to you if you are the type of guy who wants a truck for work and play.  The 2000 GMC Sierra Classic Crew Cab is the cowboy's truck par excellence.  Well, remember you can always upgrade to some more power.  It all depends on your needs!<br><br>
