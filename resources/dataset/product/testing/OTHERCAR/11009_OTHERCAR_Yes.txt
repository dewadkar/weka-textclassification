            I bought this van for the fact that I have kids and do good bit of school functions that require me to transport other children.This van has lots of free room for everyone.I love best about this van is that it has been very reliable I have owned mine for six years now and have had do only miner work on (oil change, tune up etc.)I can proudly say this vehicle has never left me strayed before. I have owned other cars before and this one by far was the best investment I  have made so far.Driving this van is a little bumpy but no worse than others. People who I recommend buying this van is someone who has a family or just needs a vehicle that they won't have to replace or be stuck with lots of major work every time they turn around.<br><br>
