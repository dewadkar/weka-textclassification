            This car was good to me even though I only had it for a year.  Living in a winter prone area having a four wheel drive is a must,  but it was also a good car to have in the city.  Being that it is so small it was perfect to fit in the small little areas where you have to park.  The only real downfall with this vehicle was the fact that it was so small.  You see, we are on the road a lot, and even though my husband is only 5'10&quot; it was a very uncomfortable drive.  This is a very good car for short commutes, but it is not one for people with families or people who need to travel a lot.  As a single person I would love to have a tracker again, and maybe some day if we get a second car this one will be it.<br><br>
