            I bought Nikon 5400 after about 3 months of researching. I had an old Olympus D450-Z 1.3 MP and it was about time to upgrade. I am not a photographer but I know a thing or two, and I am trying to learn how to be close to one.

Before I buy anything, especially if it is something expensive I get organized. I read reviews from everywhere, comparing products for a long time. The process of choosing the right camera wasn't easy. I read hundreds of reviews from professional and amateur photographers in magazines and websites, but also from simple consumers and everyday users.

I started with 7 5MP cameras: From Canon the S50 and G5, from Olympus the C-5050, from Sony the DSC-V1 and the DSC-717 and finally from Nikon the 5400 and the 5700.  I&#146ve seen more but I quickly narrowed my selection to these.

Here I have to say before you buy any camera visit www.dpreview.com and www.megapixel.net
They have test photos and reviews for almost all the cameras out there. 

So after comparing features, prices and photos side by side with 10 IE windows open at a time, I learned so much about photography (:)) that I decided to go for a more serious model. There fore S50 got thrown out. 
At that point the new Canon Digital Rebel came out which is the cheapest SLR ever, by far! But then I thought that it is big and needs extra lenses and that means too much money there fore out of my budget and not a traveling camera.
I wanted something that is serious and at the same time small enough to be able to take with me everywhere without thinking it&#146ll be a pain to carry.

For the above reason the DSC 717 got out of my list too. It was also an old model and the newer models had more features. 

So now I was left with 2 Nikons 1 Olympus and 1 Canon. 
The photos of all of them were excellent. So I had to find other things to consider.

First to go was the Olympus. It was old, and had the stupid proprietary thing with the panorama feature like all Olympus cameras do. You need Olympus branded memory to take panorama pictures my old 1MP camera had that and I hated it. Olympus Branded memor is expensive and hard to find. 

At this point I started flirting with the 5400. The ore I read about it the more I liked that camera. It was a small miracle. Wide angle, descent zoom, lots of features even for the professional and so small! I&#146ve also visited best buy to see the cameras from close and feel them once again. Nikon cameras looked so... professional. The grip is so nice and the materials look so serious and sturdy. Sony V1 was ok, and very small but the Canon G5 was like a brick and feels like cheap plastic. 

The feature that makes me like V1 is the night or low light focus capabilities. The imaging chip, I thing is the same with the 5400. (Yes the 5400 uses a Sony imaging chip) while the lenses are Carl Zeiss.

	
On the other hand the G5 had also aided focus for low light and amazing color balance on it's photos. 

Then the 5700 had 8X zoom and an LED screen to use instead of the LCD so to save battery. And of course the legentary NIKKOR lense

And finally the 5400 had the best touch and feel, wide angle Nikkor Lenses and so many features that it is crazy (I&#146ll come back on this)

Oh well to cut the long story short, I threw out 5700 first because of the price (slightly more expensive) and also because it is big and old and no low light focus (I hate Nikon for that). After all 8x zoom is not that useful.

Then I decided against V1 because it has less features than the Nikons and Canon's G5. V1 is more for the amateur than the professional. Not that I am a professional, but I am trying to learn.

Finally I decided against Canon, mainly because of 2 reasons. First I read in many reviews that when you take photos with flash there is shadow on the right lower corner of the photo, because of the wrong position of the flash! That so threw me off. The second reason is the cheap looking built of the camera.

NIKON 5400
So I was left with Nikon 5400. I bought it. I have it for few months now and I still get amazed!(how did Nikon put sow many things in there?! It is so small!)
The wide angle is so useful: For those group pictures, for big buildings, for wide lakes, for everything. The 4X zoom is enough, the 5.1 MP more than enough. 

Versatility:
I&#146ve taken pictures everywhere: In museums, outdoors, indoors, with flash with no flash, fireworks, with snow, at dusk and dawn and at night. The camera takes whatever you throw at it. The photos are breathtaking. I am still learning the features. I read the manual but there are so many, I have to reference at it every once in a while. 
Design:
The camera is so well designed that it just fits right in your hands. The flash is positioned in such a perfect way that even if you don't use the red eye reduction system there are no red eyes! (You know that annoying multiple flashing that everybody complains about after you take the photo?) It needs to be used only when the persons you are photographing are standing kind off far away.
The size and weight of the camera allows me to just throw it in my pocket, bag or shoulder and go!
The battery life is descent. It takes 2 hours to charge and you can take about 2 days of photos. (I think about 200-300 photos, using the LCD for all of them).
Quality:
The photos are bright and crispy clean. No noise, unless you use the high ISO settings and even then you can use the noise reduction system. 
I am not going to write about the features it has because those you can find else where

The only cons I&#146ve found is one I&#146ve known before I bought it and it is the no low light focus aid. But I&#146ve taken photos in low light conditions (even in no light conditions) and they are great. You just have to play little bit with the manual settings and focus.

After I bought this camera I&#146ve found a book about Nikon Digital cameras. It is an e-book by Peter iNova, a professional photographer. This camera is his favorite one. I bought the book. It is very nice and teaches you a lot of things about photography and digital imaging from the camera to the computer (Photoshop).
With this camera I learned so many things and I am getting better and better. I think after all the readings and comparisons I made the right choice. This camera is the best point-and-shoot out there. For the amateur photographers who want to learn more, but also for photographers who want a traveling point and shoot camera. (yes this camera has also a simple point and shoot feature that you can use when you want to take a quick photo, or when you give the camera to somebody else to take the photo : )
