               After owning a 1994 Jeep Cherokee for about 5 years, I felt it was about time to make a change. But what else could I possibly turn to except another quality made Jeep product?
   On the most unexpected lot sat a newly arrived Jeep Wrangler. Besides the attractive red color, what really caught my eye was the 4.0 liter Sport decal on the fender.  After much thoughful consideration and practically emptying my checkbook , I finally drove off the lot with what would soon prove to be a very great buy.
   It wasn't anymore than a few days when I began to discover how drastically different this Wrangler was from previous years.  SInce my uncle had owned a 1994 Wrangler up until a year before I purchased my 99' Wrangler, it was quite easy to make comparisions in practically every aspect between the older, sloppy handling Jeeps, and the seemingly improved ride/handling Jeep.
   As i stated before, the most drastic change that I noticed was the unexpected responsive handling. Unlike Jeeps from the previous years, the Wrangler introduce in 1999 is equipped with rack and pinion steering. By doing so, gone are the days of the squarrly, ill-handling Jeep of yesterday, something that has haunted the Jeep Wrangler line for some time. Because the Wrangler has such a short wheelbase, they will always have a tendency to be roller skate on ice. But no longer is there a 10" gap between steering left and right.
   Although there has been much critisism in the past on the ill-handling Jeep, one thing has remained the same.  With 195 standard horsepower produced by the 4.0 liter engine, the Jeep Wrangler Sport seems a most appropriate addition to the product line.  During the times of the CJ-5's and CJ-7's, the one item that Jeep owners couldn't deny was the available power they had.  Although the Jeeps are not raw, trailer pulling powered machines, they definately have a weight to horsepower ratio that would surprise most.  If its a fear of  lack of power and stability for off-roading you have, let me put that to rest quickly.
   After driving in North Dakota for a few years, you soon discover that one of the most important assests a person can own a dependent four wheel drive vehicle. But why stop there when you can purchase a four wheel drive vehicle that is intended for more than just practical needs?  Anyone that has owned a Jeep will agree with me that any product made by Jeep must of been tested in every corner of the world.  After must snow and mud testing, I can proudly say that this Jeep product once again doesn't disappoint.  Its been practically everywhere, from mud as deep as the running boards to snow beating on the bumper. Not once was I disappointed by its performance.
    Along with its improved powertrain and drivetrain, the interior also went through s slight cosmetic change. The gages are set back in the dash a little further and are now more convenient to view. The seating is more than comfortably adequate for a Jeep.  Besides these minor changes, nothing much is different.
