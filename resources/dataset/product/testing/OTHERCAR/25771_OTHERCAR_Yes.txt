            I bought my 1993 Nissan Altima GXE (used), with 57,000 miles on it.  I too wasn't too sure about getting an Altima.  I was on the low end as far as budget goes and couldn't get anything running over the $10k frame. After looking at several other models at the Nissan dealer, I came upon this one, which was the cheapest one at $7,500. I financed it and by the time I'm done I will end up paying close to $10,000.    For this price on a used car I can tell you I was amazed at what my car has given me.  I've had it for about a year now and had no major problems with it.  It is roomy enough for a mid-sized sedan and great if you have children, offering a lot of trunk space.  It is not a high end luxury car, but it is the closest thing for someone keeping a low budget in mind. 

By now, I've put a good 20,000 miles on it and had no problems, which to me is good for a 7 year old car.  Not only that, I could tell the car had been in a previous accident and there was little or no damage to the car's interior mechanism, which is good.  Some cars just blow from any little accident.
 
The only thing I've had to do often is change the break pads. But, then again, I am someone that is constantly on the road. I've been told by my mechanic that Altimas are known to need constant break repair.  Other than that, regular maintenance, is a must for everyone.  

I have no complaints about my Nissan Altima.  I would definitely buy another one.  And, I would recommend this car to anyone, especially a family with children who are looking for something close to a luxury sedan, but that can't afford anything that's too expensive.
