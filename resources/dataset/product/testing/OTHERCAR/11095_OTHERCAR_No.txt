            I remember the day clearly, I had already graduated from a two year Nursing program, passed the boards.  I was on my to getting my BSN and a year into that program and felt I deserved a brand new car.  

I preface with that information because you would think someone with a little education would have an eye for a good car.  I wanted to buy American...don't ask, I was young and very proud to have volumes of opportunity.

After shopping for a few weeks I thought I found the perfect car.  It was small but not too small, great on gas, mildly sporty, had a roof rack, automatic,  and above all the perfect price.  It was a Pontiac LeMans.  

Well, PONTIAC is American, but the engine was made in Korea! Need I say more?  

I refused assistance for purchasing my new car, I wanted to do it on my own.  That dealership saw me coming.  

I was proud of my accomplishment as I signed the contracts, I got my keys and was now the owner of a NEW car.

Within one week, the car was back in the shop!  There was recall on the wiring within the engine and the rain storm I drove through triggered the stall.  Fortunately I had purchased extended warranties and the towing was FREE.  The car was back several times but each repair was free so I didn't think anything of it.  

The braking system is poorly made, which leads to excess wear and tear on the brake pads which in turn ruins the rotors.  I had this fixed and then just bought in the car every three months for inspection.  I had purchased the new rotors and pads through a program where the pads are replaced free.  This car was high maintenance.

The engine, was just the worst.  Parts were difficult to find if I didn't go directly through the dealer and the dealer charged a small fortune to fix.  The car had no pick up.  You could hear everything.

I learned from this experience though, research is the key!  I was in too much of a hurry.   I later learned that this car may have 'qualified' to be a lemon.
