            My son and I rented a 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 I-6 for our trip to detroit for the auto show.  I wanted to rent a 4wd just to be safe because those lake effect snow showers can get bad.  

   I rented my red Jeep (same color as my old 96 Grand Cherokee) Laredo from Enterprise Rent-A-Car (it was hassle-free by the way).  The drve was 5 hours not factoring in the 30 minutes worth of rest and refueling stops we made, and the Jeep remained comfortableand easy to drive.  It's a big jump handling wise from a Lincoln Navigator to a Jeep, and it was a good one.  The cloth seats were more comfortable than leather, The old 6 cylender really worked well being in a light (for an SUV) package, and the standard stereo was great. The 2nd generataion GC's are indeed better ovearll than the 1st gen sold from 1993-1998.

    There are a few things that remain though, good and bad.  The good things are its great traction, Cool style, great value, agility, handling, and good power.

     The bad are the poor backseat and cargo space, and sometimes bad intereior quality, and the poor fuel econemy no matter which engine (worse with the V8). 

    As you can see, most of my gripes are with the interior.  When Jeep re-does the GC (and please Jeep, don't mess it up liek you did with the Cherokee replacement),  they better make the interior bigger to attract customers like myself and others.  And while you're at it, throw a small 3rd row seat back there that stowes under the floor too.
