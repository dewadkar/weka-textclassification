                I fell in love with the S-10 pickup shortly after going to work for a small delivery company that had seven of the S-10's in fleet. When trucks that are used in such commercial applications they will either quickly shine or fall by the road side. The S-10 shined early on and kept producing profit up into the 350,000 mile range.   I know this sounds impossible but it is true. The main problems that seem to repeat themselves where electrical and transmission.Transmission faults occur at the 200,000 mile range and where easily repaired buy a few bearing replacements.That is very impressive when you consider at least 50% of those miles was at max payload.   The electrical problems come from the normal abuse of bouncing down the road day in and day out. These problems where more or less lighting and environmental controls. These problems occur around the 175,000 mile range.   So these are the main reasons I purchased a S-10. Normal everyday driving these little trucks will last a long time when proper maintenance is kept up on the vehicle.<br><br>
