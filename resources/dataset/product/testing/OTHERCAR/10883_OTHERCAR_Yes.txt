            The picture quality of the PV-DC2590 is great, you can take photos at 1280 x 960, with 1.3 mega-pixel. Resolution at 1280 x 960 is more than most people will ever use.

 It has a 3x Zoom lens that works smooth and quick. The 3x Optical has a zoom range from 34-102mm. Plus a 2x digital zoom, this is for more close up detailed photography.

The camera is in a plastic silver case and it looks a lot like your instant 35mm cameras with a built-in flash. 
        
<b>What to look at?</b>
1.	You have a 1.8 inch LCD Color viewfinder. This is nice to see what the picture looks like and if you wish to keep the picture or delete it. You can also view up to nine thumbnail images so you can pick the one you want to view.

2.	There is a Monochrome Display LCD Panel. This LCD panel is on top of the camera. Here you can see the condition of the batteries, flash mode, time lapse mode, Black &amp; White mode, recording mode, self timer and how many pictures are left to take. It also shows which of the two Compact-Flash Type II slots are being used.

<b>Pros</b>
The pictures look absolutely beautiful, for a camera under $500 it offers a lot.

There is a modem card included with the camera. What this means, now you can send pictures to your home computer. It is available in the US only and made for the PC and Windows. There are instructions for those Macintosh users.
(I haven't used the modem card yet.)

There are two Compact-Flash Type II slots, now you can use two Compact-Flash memory cards at the same time or use one slot for other cards like the modem card. It comes with one 8 MB Compact-Flash card.

Easy to use software, the software is for the PC and Macintosh users. They also include for Windows Adobe Photo Deluxe Home Edition 3.0 and for the Macintosh Adobe Photo Deluxe 2.0.

There are four flash modes to choose from: Redeye Reduction, Automatic, Always on and Always off. I like it in the automatic mode and get excellent results.   

You can record four seconds of motion at 320 x 240 resolution. Four seconds doesn't seem like much time but, you will be surprised at what you can record in four seconds. It is saved in the AVI format.                           

<b>Cons</b>
It has a 1 to 2 second delay when you use the flash. What I mean by that is, once you press the button to take your picture, it takes 1 to 2 seconds for the flash to fire and synchronize with the shutter. 

It is a battery eater, the color LCD is what eats up the batteries so quickly.  I suggest a set of 8 Ni-Cad batteries, that way you can always have 4 charged batteries to go. 

<b>More info on the camera</b>
1.	Auto Focus

2.	 A 10-Second Self-Timer is built in.

3.	NTSC Video Out and Serial interface.

4.	Size 4.65 inches wide x 2.68 inches tall x 2 inches thick and weighs 9.8 ounces.

5.	PC users need Windows 95, 98, 2000 or Me; Macintosh users need OS 8.0 or better.

6.	Six record modes, Super Fine, Fine, Normal, Zoom, Motion Image and Burst. In Burst mode it can take up to 16 images at 1/2-second intervals.

7.	Resolution is 640 x 480 VGA or 1280 x 960 SVGA.

<b>Bonus</b>
There are four AA alkaline batteries that come with the camera. Then there is a coupon to mail in to get four AA Ni-Cad batteries with the charger for only $3.00 to cover shipping and handling. There are also more coupons if you wish to purchase additional Ni-Cad batteries.
(I highly recommend to order this for only $3.)

The four batteries with the charger are FREE; I don't understand why they just don't put it in with the camera when you buy it.

<b>My last words</b>
The Panasonic PV-DC2590 PalmCam also comes with a hand strap, Serial cable for the PC and a Video cable.

This is a nice handling camera and takes excellent pictures. It will take most people a little while to get use to all that this camera has to offer.

I highly recommend this beauty.
