            I recently found myself having to trade in the Mustang convertible for a more &quot;family-oriented&quot; vehicle.  After a lot of research and price wars, I was able to locate a 1995 Honda Accord.  I have never been happier with a purchase!  From the front wheel drive to the massive trunk space, it's proven itself to be a comfortable, economical, and good looking vehicle.  With the extra leg room, the little one loves the idea of not having to kick the back of daddy's seat.  It's got a 4-cylinder engine, but it seems like it's got quite a lot of kick for a four banger.  Only thing I could complain about would be the handling in snow - the front wheel drive helps, but I still get a little slip and slide if I take a turn too fast.  I would recommend the Accord to anyone, and if you look, the car will hold it's value on trade in.  It's most definitely a great buy.<br><br>
