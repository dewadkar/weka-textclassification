            <b> Why this truck? </b>
I choose this vehicle since it affords me the ability with the long bed to haul items without the bed-extension (just over 6') and still have the relative height and comfort commuting the 38 miles each way on the highway and through city streets.  
<b> Price w/comparison </b>
Listed out at: $26,515, purchased at $22,900. Even though the sticker price is high it is still about 2-3k less than the Ford version and about 5k less than the F150.  Even though the F150 gives you more passenger room.  For my needs I carry people only for short trips so its never a real issue.  If you have kids then its great for them.  
<b>The Ride </b>
The truck rides slightly stiffer than a full-size car (but heh, it's a truck) but it is very quite and comfortable on the highway.  Off-road the truck rides great and it's compact size helps when running through narrow trails and high brush.  Molehills are best taken at an angle and what I don't like is the fact that if you get high center, the weakest wheel gets most if not all the power.  But that's the price you pay for the 'auto-hub lock' feature on most all SUV/4X4 vehicles now days.  Just pack a shovel and some carpet (or just use rocks around the area) and the truck will climb right out of the hole (assuming you are in 4Low and 1st gear).
<b>Fuel economy/power </b>
I seem to be getting about 17.5 MPG in city/freeway driving and need to fill up about 280-300 miles.  The fuel light comes on at about 16 gal used but it holds just over 19 so you still have a ways to go if you need to.  If you need to punch it the truck doesn't rear up on the front.  It seems rear up on all four tires and immediately blasts forward. If you want to have a bit more muscle during this punch then I would recommend you go for the super-charged engine which runs you up from the 180HP to 210HP. 
<b>Radio/gap insr </b>
I got most of the options available but if I had to do this again I would upgrade the CD to the 6-CD player version.  The sound from the AM/FM radio is nice but just play a CD and it seems like a BOSE (very nice), 6-speaker system.  
If your dealer does not offer the 'gap' insurance I would highly recommend it.  The cost is only $200 and in the event of a complete loss the gap insurance will cover the depreciation.
<b>The deal</b>
The truck listed out (after 'desert protection' package) to $26,515 but if you pay more than $23k you are paying more than you need.  I talked them down to $22,900 and most likely could of gone less but I was in and out of the dealership after only 1 1/2 hours and took advantage of their 0.9% financing.  
I would also recommend their premium repair package. This will cover you for up to 100,000 miles and if you don't end up using it you can get a full refund, pro-rated if you do use part of it.  The cost is about $1,600.
<b>Details/Options</b>
Overall it's a great truck with the options that really help it stand out.
