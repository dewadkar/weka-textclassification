            I have a 1992 Dodge Dakota that I purchased with 7,000 miles on it in 1994.  What impressed me at the time was how solid it was for a mid-size truck, and the fact that I could tow a 2-horse trailer with 2,500 pounds of quarter horses inside!  What impresses me now is that 6 years and 180,000 miles later, it STILL has the same power in its economical-to-run V-6 engine.  Other than the regular maintenance that every automobile needs to have, I have only replaced the fuel pump, and that only happened after more than 160,000 miles!  I can't say enough about how dependable this truck has been.  It is surprisingly good in snow (no, it is not a 4 wheel drive), corners well and stops on a dime when I ask it to.  I drive almost 100 miles round-trip for work every day, and my family never worries if they know I'm in my truck!  My significant other and I have driven this truck straight through from WI to WVa twice, once pulling a heavily loaded trailer.  No problems, and no &quot;seat sores&quot; either!  Will definitely buy another IF this one ever wears out!!!<br><br>
