            When we bought our Sportage we had just come out of bankruptcy (from a failed business) the year before so what we could qualify for finance-wise was limited.  Living in Maine we wanted a vehicle with 4WD & an automatic.  We had never thought we would ever consider buying a Kia, but in our situation it was one of the few choices we could afford.  We bought it at the end of a summer that was not too hot.  Little had we known that the a/c was on its last legs (we would not find out until almost a year later what was wrong with it would take $600 to fix-we have not had it fixed).  That following summer was sweltering with several days in the 90s (and Maine can get quite hot in the summer, believe it or not).

I like driving the Sportage.  It is a good size for me (I am 5' 11") & I like the height (I do not feel like I'm on the ground as I did with my Subaru Legacy); I can see what is going on in traffic in front of me (ie gives me more time to react).  It came with a cd player, but I had my own installed with a mini-sub woofer so the sound is good.  I like the cruise control option & the sun roof which I use a lot. It does not corner well & shakes on the highway at fast speed (sometimes), but other than that it drives & handles well.  The acceleration is not bad for a 4 cyl. & the gas mileage isn't bad for an "SUV" (avg. in the low 20s).
  
The first year went by with only having to do the occasional oil/filter change (so far, so good).  At the 60000 mile mark we had the routine stuff done totaling a little over $600.  

Then came Christmas of 2002.  A ton of snow fell the last week of the year & we discovered that the 4wd did not work.  Plus our exhaust/tail pipe was falling apart (& a shield from the bottom of the car literally fell off after starting it one day).  

We have taken the car for an inspection today.  Other stuff that we need done: a new windshield due to a crack from a rock that hit it on the highway & a patch on one of the tires (has a low leak).  I am awaiting an estimate to get the inspection.  We take it to our local Kia dealer who is usually good (we figured they would be the best since they work on them all the time & they are just down the road from where we currently reside), but often do not answer the phone when we call to make an appointment.

We will not be keeping our Sportage after July.  We are special ordering a Honda Element EX.  We trust Honda's reliability & find that the overall versatility of the Element will better fit our lifestyle.  I am sure I will miss some of the things about the Sportage, but I will NOT miss not having a/c & 4WD!
