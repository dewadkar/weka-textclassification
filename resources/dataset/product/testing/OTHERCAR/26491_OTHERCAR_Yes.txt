            When in the market for a compact truck, I did my research on all brand names and varieties.  My family used to own a 1996 S-10 with a four cylinder engine.  The truck was great except for the fact that it used an underpowered 4 cylinder engine.  

When I decided to buy my truck, I test drove virtually every 6 cylinder model of compact truck since all the fours were too weak.  The 6 cylinder in the S-10 and Sonoma puts out plenty of power for hauling and passing.  After I bought my truck, my Dad returned to the dealer the next day and traded his 1996 for a brand new year 2000.  My Dad is not the type to make impulse buys and nothing was wrong with our old truck.  He was simply that impressed with my truck.

Both of our trucks are 4.3 liter V6s with extended cabs, 5 speed manual transmissions, 3.08 rear axle ratio, bucket seats, and the third door.  The manual transmission in the Y2K model is much smoother than the one in our 1996 model.  The 3.08 rear axle ratio provides for improved fuel economy but takes away some of the truck's get up and go.  If you are not going to use the truck for serious hauling/towing, get the 3.08 axle ratio.  The 6 cylinder engine still provides plenty of power to pass and haul in most cases.  My Dad's truck features the sport suspension which is excellent for road and light off-road use.  Go with the Z85 or ZR2 package if you want a work/off-road truck.  The third door is very useful for loading and unloading larger items from the back seat.  When choosing the 3rd door option, you sacrifice one rear seat and both rear speakers.

The interior of the trucks is quiet and roomy.  The front bucket seat provide for excellent comfort.  Both trucks feature the optional CD player which sounds very nice.  It doesn't skip unlike many stock CD players I have listened to in my day.  I do miss the rear speakers, but it isn't a huge disadvantage.  The back seats are still cramped, but are improved from our 1996.  The truck rides very quietly with no squeaks or rattles.  There is still some wind noise since it is a truck, but the truck feels solid and sturdy.  The V6 in the S-10 sounds very nice if you are into the sound of the engine.  It is nice and low unlike the high pitched 4-cylinders and 6-cylinders on most of the competition.  The cruise control on these trucks is excellent.  I am usually not a fan of cruise control because I have never actually used cruise that keeps a vehicle at a constant speed.  The cruise in the S-10 is different.  When used on highway and it didn't fluctuate one bit.  The truck climbed large hills on the highway in fifth gear while in cruise without any trouble.  When tackling the same exact hills in our 1996 four cylinder, I always had to shift to fourth gear and press the gas pedal all the way to the floor.  The V6 doesn't even seem to work hard while climbing the same hills.

If you are looking for a small truck test drive the competition and then the Chevy.  You will be amazed at the different, especially in the 6 cylinder models.  The rear seats are better in some competing models, but everything else seems better in the Chevy.  The price is also slightly cheaper for the Chevy with the options that we selected.

If fuel economy is of the utmost importance, go with the 4 cylinder.  These engines have been improved since our 1996 model, but still aren't super powerful.  If you can afford about $1200 extra for the V6 and its slightly lower MPG, go with the V6!  You will not regret getting this extra performance.

Two members of the same family bought similar trucks within 24 hours from the same dealer so Chevy must be doing something right.  Elco Chevrolet in Ballwin, Missouri was very helpful in both truck purchases.  Elco is unlike some dealers who jerk the customer around and try to make them feel stupid.  Before going to the dealer, look up dealer invoice prices on the net.  This makes for an excellent negotiation tool.

The whole S-10 experience has been excellent and I would buy another one in the future.  <br><br>
