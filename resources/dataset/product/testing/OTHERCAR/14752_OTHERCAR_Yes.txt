            I've loved the Honda Civic Crx Si 91,  for years. The moment that i opened up the hood of the crx, i saw the potential the car had! The only problem i have with the car is that it doesn't have a back seat space for the family, otherwise its an all out perfect car!!! The best thing is that the Crx fits in the tightest spots when parking. That takes a lot of time away from looking for a spot.   This little &quot;jewel&quot; can be modified to go against, even the hardest corvetts. Even if your on a tight budget a set of rims, and an exhaust, can make this car look great!  This is the car of my dreams!!!I guess it all depends on the type of person you are to really let your imagination run with ideas for this sporty car. 
THE POSSIBILITIES FOR MODIFICATIONS ARE ENDLESS!!!<br><br>
