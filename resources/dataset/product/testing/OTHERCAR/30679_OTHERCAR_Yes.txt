            I love my &quot;new&quot; Jeep!!  We recently bought a '97 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited.  I can't believe I drove anything else! My husband has always been a huge fan of the Jeep.  We also have a '74 CJ5.  We decided we needed a new vehicle, as the one I was currently carrying our children around in was so small, a Tracker could probably have run it over.   

My husband went and got pre-approved for a loan at our credit union, without telling me.  When he told me that day, I told him he was crazy and we could not afford another high car payment.  On the way home from work that night he stopped and found our jeep.  The next day we went in, I test drove it, and we bought it.  

Riding in the Jeep is like riding on a cloud.  It has leather seats, CD and cassette player, power everything.  It even has defrost for the side mirrors!!  I've never heard of such a thing!  One of the features that I love the most, is the child lock rear doors.  There is little switch on the door when they are opened, that when you turn it on, the doors can only be opened from the outside.  This will be perfect when my daughter gets a little older and will want to play with that &quot;pretty shiney thing&quot; on the door, while driving down the road.  Right now, she enjoys using her toes to hit the window switch, rolling the window up and down.  

My husband's brother and his wife have owned a Jeep like this one for almost 4 years.  We used it last fall to make a 2800 mile round-trip ride to see my family, and we took our 65 pound Chow Chow too!  We couldn't have been more comfortable!  I would recommend this vehicle to anyone.  It is enjoyable and convenient for even those who don't have children. <br><br>
