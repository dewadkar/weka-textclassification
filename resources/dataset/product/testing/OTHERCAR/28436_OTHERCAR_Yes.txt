            When it comes to the success of a new car, I find myself rarely wrong. From the time that I hear of the concept, or see the sketches, I can pretty accurately predict how it will be received by the buying public and how it will live out its product cycle. Gifted, you ask?  Not really. I have simply been watching the industry rather closely for the last twenty years, and in that time, with few exceptions, the manufacturers have proven to be somewhat predictable, making my assumptions fairly easy.

Now, I am of course not perfect. Every now and again, I find myself surprised at a certain outcome. I had my money bet on the Eagle�s Audi copycat, the Premiere, especially in stunning ES Limited form. I was certain that the multinationally developed Sterling would be a hit. Unfortunately, though, we somehow got the worst of all worlds instead of the best. Also, I am still scratching my head about the failure of the taught Merkur XR4Ti. I knew at the time what the obstacles were that lay before these cars, but, after assessing the product, I did not feel that these problems would be enough to ultimately unseat them.

My embarrassment as a car guy also extends in the other direction, as, in addition to success, I have inaccurately predicted failure. The jumbled behemoth, known as the Lincoln Navigator seems to sell like hotcakes despite a fourth-grade attempt at applying Lincoln elements to an Expedition.  Nissan�s under powered and pointlessly styled Altima is one of the company�s best sellers, and sometime while I was asleep, it became cool to own slow, tiny, impractical BMW convertibles. Again, I saw elements that could shape the course of the cars future, but miscalculated the public�s reactions. In other words, I see why they are so popular; I just feel that, given what they are, they should not be. 

The focus of this Epinion, however, is one that initially baffled me the most. When the Toyota Avalon first arrived for sale six years ago, I gave it three model years to live. I figured that, being a moderately attractive Toyota, there would be a small initial surge from loyalists, followed by a steep drop off. After a bit would be spent on some mid second-year modifications, Toyota would pull the plug as they watched consumers slide straight over to Lexus and their similarly priced ES300. Who would want a Toyota when a Lexus could be had for similar money? Good question indeed.

Toyotas used to be edgy and youthful alternatives to what tragically conservative America typically bought. Then, as success flourished, the tied began to change. I recall, as a little boy, being enamored by a neighbor's brand new, 1987 Cressida. It was crisply angled with flawless proportion. The body was beautifully detailed with stunning, European looking wheels, tasteful chrome bright work and mirror-like black paint, miles deep. Anyone thinking BMW 3 Series would have been wise to talk with Toyota first. By 1989, though, the Camry had seated itself as a cultural phenomenon, and was beginning to compete with the Maxima, not the Stanza. This, plus a less successful, rounded-off makeover, rendered the premium Toyota a bit obsolete. Let us also not forget that 1989 was the year that the industry was all a buzz over Toyota�s new world dominating Lexus line. As stated before, the entry level Lexus seems to float in and out of this price class, and at the time, the new ES250 was stomping all over the poor Cressida. So, logically, it promptly and unceremoniously disappeared.  

�Avalon� in Celtic legend, is an island, represented as an earthly paradise in the western seas. It is also a town in southwestern Pennsylvania, a 1990 �coming-of-age� movie by Barry Levinson, and for the 1995 model year, Toyota�s new premium car. At first glance, the plain, slab sided new car did not seem like much of a step beyond the Cressida which it replaced. It was, though, in fact quite a different car. It was the very first six-passenger sedan sold in this country by a Japanese automaker. Built on a stretched Camry platform, the Avalon was also the roomiest Japanese car ever offered in the U.S.  A front bench seat was offered instead of Toyota�s typical buckets. In addition, a more powerful version of the Camry�s 3.0 liter V6 was employed matted to a 4-speed automatic. After riding in one, it finally dawned on me. The new Avalon is not competing with the BMW 3-Series or Audi 90 as the Cressida was; it was competing against the Mercury Grand Marquis and Buick Park Avenue. This represents a rather new age bracket for Toyota and subsequently, was a new sort of venture. This was why, for me, it was difficult to spot.

The Avalon did not offer the strong power, boulevard ride, towing capacity, or historical merit of the traditional big cruisers. It did, however, bring with it quality, and most importantly, brilliant packaging. A problem with this sort of car has been in the past, the way the body was allocated. Large trunks, bulky drive shafts and overgrown engine bays left little room for the occupants and despite their overall size, cars like Buick�s Roadmaster, felt surprisingly tight inside. The Avalon was ideally proportioned and though exterior dimensions were reasonable, the interior felt expansive. Ergonomics were ideal too, something that is often poorly handled on large cars. Also, the powerful V6 scooted the Avalon from 0-60 faster than the Grand Marquis or Chrysler New Yorker, while returning substantially better fuel economy.  At $30,000 dollars, well optioned, it was pricier than its competition, but in typical Toyota fashion, it�s not so much the things it does for you, but all the things that it doesn�t do to you, that really make it great.

After witnessing steadily increasing success, Toyota got serious for the Avalon�s 2000 model year redesign. Toyota representatives have even gone so far as to call it �Toyota�s Buick�. The new Avalon is larger, more powerful, and with increased safety features. All of this was accomplished while holding the line on pricing to put the car square into LeSabre territory. The distinct new premium Toyota is built along side the Camry (upon which it is still based), in Georgetown Kentucky. Built in the U.S., for the U.S. My drive time in a 2000 Avalon was under rather unusual circumstances. Because of my frequently embellished performance driving capabilities, I was asked to act as chauffer to one of my wife�s friends, the day they were married. This meant to the church, the reception, and the airport. There was some concern that certain fraternity brothers may try to intercede on this joyous day, so I was instructed to constantly check for tails and elude any followers. I was in the car, (the brides 58 year old uncle�s) in total for almost two hours and had the opportunity to test its extremities a bit, especially as we found ourselves late to catch a plane. 

The new model is a bit taller than its predecessor, but wheelbase, track, and length are unchanged.  What is truly astonishing is that despite similar proportions to the original (and surprisingly useable exterior dimensions), the Avalon feels even larger on the inside. Forty-layers of petticoat with a five and a half foot bride stuffed into them fit through the rear door with ease and had plenty of space inside (51 cubic feet in the rear). In the second generation, Toyota paid special attention to gaining the most spatial bang for the buck. The rear seating position was relocated back and up a bit. Raising the roof an inch also helped to expand the greenhouse area, lending a more spacious feel. Also, width increased 1.2 inches to help combat the 3-across seating troubles of the last car. At 16 cubic feet, the Avalon�s trunk will please travelers, as will the terrifically low lift over height. Storage is plentiful between the seats and in the doors, for maps and such. Structural integrity, even over broken pavement, is flawless, feeling to be carved from a single piece of steel, and at 68 decibels, cruising on the freeway, the Avalon finds itself nearly as quiet as it�s vault-like, Lexus step sisters. The dash is clear and relatively easy to understand, and the steering wheel nice and thick. It was odd for me to be in a Toyota that had a column mounted shift lever, but its fluid action helped to break me in with a smile. The center control panel is wonderfully positioned for ease of use, but still allows for adequate knee room for a center, front seat passenger. The LCD displays, though, were a bit difficult to decipher, especially with the confusing climate control pictogram. This leads me in to an important point. 

Buick is still the master in this large-car market segment and a little attention the way instrumentation is handled would benefit Toyota greatly. Larger controls that are easy to grasp and offer little resistance, large gauges and displays, and lots of contrast are some important aspects that make LeSabres seem so comforting to the arthritically prone, sight impaired seniors. Besides, universal design concepts benefit everybody. If you can, indeed, figure out the stereo system, you will be pleased, as the optional JBL unit offers a fantastic, 250-watts of sound. Leather upholstered seats felt very comfortable, but are clearly designed for long trips by heftier people than I. Side bolstering is a bit soft for sporty driving. Also, though I like the simple, and realistic placement of plastic interior wood accents (which were above average in quality), I felt that the hue Toyota chose to imitate was too orangey of a stain. A more exotic tone should never be used when trying to convince occupants of its authenticity.

 The Avalon�s styling may take some getting used to because it is sized like a large car, but not necessarily proportioned like one. The forward canting stance and clear lens headlamps help to lend a modern appeal, while the Avalon wears some of the nicest looking rims that I have seen on a Toyota. Some of the details are a bit odd, though. The nose is thoroughly anonymous and unimaginative and the squared off roofline (for accommodating six-foot clientele in the rear seats) pushes its C-pillars back so far that from some angles, the Avalon looks like a hatchback. In addition, the body-side rub-strips relate poorly to the design and look tacked on after the fact. I do like how Toyota stylists used the edges of the tail lamps to hide the seams of the trunk lid, and the wheels are reasonably well placed against the slab sided body. Overall, the appearance is classy and distinctive (as Toyotas go), though the car looks better in person than in photographs.

On the road, Toyota�s VVTi, 3.0-liter dual overhead cam V6 is as subtle and smooth as I have seen. For those that may be unaware, variable valve timing (VVTi) is becoming increasingly popular these days because of its ability to draw more power from smaller lighter engines. Instead of valve timing simply being a constant in the engine, it is continually retarded or advanced based on the conditions of each revolution. This �smart engine� technology allows the engine to run more efficiently by taking better advantage of each cylinder revolution, ultimately allowing less power to be converted to useless heat or sound energy. Power is now up to 210 horsepower and 220 pound feet of torque at 5800, and 4400 rpm�s respectively. This is quite a usable number for a variable valve timed Toyota engine, bit still a bit higher than some of the some of its competitors that, through overhead valves, can muster torque sooner. This is an important element given the older age group expected to buy these cars, and the fact that they will not necessarily be pleased that the Avalon can still only tow 2000 pounds (a class III or IV hitch is needed in addition to an anti-sway device). The new Avalon is a bit slower than the old one, which is odd to me given the negligible weight gain (less than 200 pounds), more power, and a slick automatic, but the deed is still done in a competitive 8.4 seconds. 70-0 braking was not stellar at 214 feet. This is a bit longer than competitors from Chrysler and Buick and the Avalon�s big tail waggled just a touch under hard deceleration. The 4-speed automatic with intelligence control and slope compensation control shifts flawlessly and always picks the right gear. When inclines become a tricky, the transmission apportions power so well that you need not apply much more driving consideration than on normal flat road. The all-independent suspension allows for a comfortable ride while not permitting excessive wallow like some of the competition. I understand Toyota�s choice to utilize Michelin Energy plus, 16-inch tires, as they aid in delivering a compliant ride, but I am not a big fan of theses tires as they are easy to unset and squeal. However, as would be important to this market, they are durable and cheap to replace. Also, to show that Toyota has been doing its homework into what the aged trust and do not trust, the spare tire is full size.

The usual assortment of safety features for this price class, apply, including dual front and side airbags, ABS, daytime running lights, side impact beams, front and rear headrests, child safety locks, keyless entry, and anti-theft system. The Avalon also features seatbelt pretensioners with force limitation that cinches the belts in a frontal collision, helping to minimize force on the body. Also of note is what Toyota calls VSC (Vehicle Skid Control). This system combines traction control with ABS to help reduce excessive tire slippage. Toyota makes this system sound more complex than it is, so just know that it applies brake force to slow slipping wheels. This system has been well proven in various forms in lots of cars, but as power control is not modulated at the source, long-term usage, say in heavy snow, can result in hot brakes, that will temporarily shut the system down. The big Toyota should see 21/29 city/highway miles, putting it above much of its mamouth-engined competitors. In addition to wide seats and a big trunk, travelers will be pleased with a sizable, 18.5-gallon fuel cell.

 Toyota�s product website optimistically places the Maxima, 3.2TL, and Volvo S60 as the most direct competitors. This is laughingly unrealistic, though, as potential Avalon buyers will be looking for a large touring car, not a midsized or compact sports sedan. They have to be, as one drive in the Avalon will remind you more of a Lincoln Continental, than a hot-rod Maxima. Thusly, I feel satisfied that my quandary has been remedied. As the baby boomers enter the early stages of senescence, they will indeed need another plateau to step to when trading in their Camry. Some of these people are retiring and as children leave the nest, are trying to simplify their lives. Part of the perspective gained from this period is that a slightly pricier and more image conscious Lexus is not practical on a fixed income, and generally unnecessary, given the availability of the thoroughly satisfying Avalon. I know my father, who retired at 51 just this year, no longer feels he has something to prove in the driveway. There are also certain theft, tax, and insurance advantages to owning a Toyota over a Lexus.

Ford says that market research suggests that there is still at least one more redesign left in the Town Car, Grand Marquis, Crown Victoria set, as our grand parents are still around to make new purchases.
Still, though, this sort of car, while once prevalent, is now in the minority, seen often as taxis.
As this sort land yacht concept has beached itself throughout the nineties, the sexagenarian set has even been compelled to start buying minivans in an effort to maintain that big trunk and floaty feel. As long as Chrysler has that market, Toyota needs to sneak into retirement home parking lots another way. I cannot see an Avalon in my driveway any time soon, as it is simply too sedate. However, for those who want a safe, comfortable, and reliable car that will lower their blood pressure instead of raise it, the Avalon will do nicely. In every way other than appearance, it is what the greats in this market like Buick and Mercury should be building and I applaud Toyota for another successfully executed, completely non-controversial product. A bit dull, yes, but entirely competent in everything that potential buyers in a more mature market will ask. 

It is my feeling that Toyota simply despises having to build the Avalon. I say this because of the fervor that the Japanese titan has been in, in recent years to move away from their stodgy image. The fact of the matter is that the average age of a Toyota buyer is now approaching 50, which unfortunately makes cars such as the Avalon, a necessity for survival. Toyota�s premium sedans of the past such as the Cressida, were more the trendy, BMW alternative. Now, unfortunately, as the market has become saturated and Lexus has stopped all over that ground, Toyota�s premium model has become what the Chrysler Fifth Avenue was fifteen years ago.  Still, though, Toyota is not stupid in trying to tap into an increasingly rare market where the only strong competition is really Buick and a few Ford products. So, the big, practical sedan market will likely see another ten solid years as the last of the World War II veterans stop buying new cars for themselves and seek comfort in assisted living conditions. For now, though, as Lincoln and Buick have long embraced, smart senior citizens have money to burn, so why not hand them a match.
