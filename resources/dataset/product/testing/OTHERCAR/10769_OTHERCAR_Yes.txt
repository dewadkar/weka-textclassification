            I bought my red '92 Suburban 1500 in September 1997, with 107,000 miles on the odometer for $12,000.  I was managing a sports car racing team, and needed a better tow vehicle. It has proved to be both stable and easy to drive on extensive trips. 

After reading numerous complaints about the brakes, I simply had the ABS system disconnected.  This was easy to do and the brakes are now great!

The first time a race car was towed, the trailer wiring caused the taillight fuse to blow.  Subsequent driving (in overdrive) led to a damaged transmission; it turns out the overdrive solenoid and the taillights share the same fuse! The entire transmission was then replaced; a heavy-duty torque converter and an added transmission fluid radiator were installed for reliability. Oh yeah; the overdrive solenoid got its own fuse!

Two years of race car towing was just too much for the engine.  The need to maintain 50 mph on steep grades led to the use of second gear and more than 4000 engine rpm. Both the rod bearings and the crankshaft were damaged.  These small-block Chevy engines have well-known problems in the "bottom end" which were long ago addressed by the racing fraternity.  I replaced the engine at 170,000 miles in August 2000; the new engine has four-bolt steel main bearing caps with oil grooves, the crankshaft rod bearing throws were cross-drilled, the rotating assembly was balanced, and a high pressure oil pump was installed.  The horsepower is unaltered; all modifications were made just for reliability.  Typical oil pressure (hot) is now 50 psi at 2500 rpm.  

"Standard" maintenance items have included alternators, brake cylinder rebuilds (front & rear), a radiator, a power steering pump, power steering hoses, oil cooler lines, rear brake drums (both were cracked), the air conditioning evaporator coils, fuel pump, and sundry smog equipment.  Both steering arms, the Pittman arm, both sway bar bushings, both driveshaft u-joints, and the windshield were also replaced.  The horribly designed aluminum heater coils have failed thrice; regular checks of coolant pH are now done.  Front brake pads last about 30,000 miles.  GMC/Chevy "factory" Suburban replacement parts are very expensive.  Rod bearings from my local Chevy dealer are $25/pair; the same parts are about $8 at my local NAPA parts dealer and $2 at Pep Boys!  When I needed a new glass on the driver's side mirror, my Chevy dealer would only replace the entire assembly ($130); I bought a replacement glass at Pep Boys for $14.  I am now retired and no longer do any towing, so the stress on the vehicle is minimal.

The only other modifications made involve the audio system.  I really like the layout of the '92 dashboard (LOVE that five band EQ!), and so decided the keep the factory "head unit."  An FM modulated CD changer has been added, and new speakers installed.  A 40Wx4 power amplifier (with active crossovers) drives the front and rear speakers, and two added speakers in the rear doors.  This maintains the use of the factory "fade" control, so optimum sound can be provided at all seats.  The big change here is an 8" dual-coil subwoofer, which has been incorporated in the center console in a ported enclosure.  It is driven by a 200 watt amplifier which uses the outputs of the stereo crossover units (set to 100 Hz).  All the wiring is out of sight; the amps are under the middle bench seat (left side), and the CD changer is under the front passenger seat. The added speakers in the doors, the subwoofer cover on the back of the center console, and the CD changer controller provide the only visible evidence of the added equipment, thus not attracting thieves. 

California has now passed more stringent smog laws which affect light trucks and SUV's, and some of these have been imposed on older vehicles.  My Suburban always passed with ease in the past; in December 2002 I was forced to replace the catalytic converter (again) and do a major tuneup in addition. The ignition timing was retarded to reduce COx emissions, and the truck was almost non-drivable. The NOx emissions then passed with ease, but the COx emissions were right at the test limit.  The smog test center advised me to try to sell the vehicle out of state, since California is trying to force all "big polluters" (aka old SUVs) off the road, and even more stringent smog requirements are expected. I know I could install "Split-Fire" spark plugs, a higher voltage spark system, and use cheaper (lower octane) fuel.  That would lead to lower COx emissions, but pre-ignition (also known as "pinging") would damage the intake valves. For now, I reset the timing and regained my old horsepower.  My only sister lives in Reno, and would love to have my old truck if it fails the next smog test in December 2004.  The paint and body are in good condition, and even the upholstery has survived intact.  At this writing (January 2003) my Suburban shows 224,000 miles on the odometer.
