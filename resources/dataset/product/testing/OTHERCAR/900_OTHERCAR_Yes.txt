            My relationship with a Lincoln LS is merely for an hour or so. I was invited to a local Lincoln dealership to test drive a car and try my luck there if I actually won one. 

Made an appointment there and found out that the salesman who was supposed to be there for us was actually busy with apparently someone else. We were promptly greeted by another gentleman who was happy to introduce us to this new addition to the Lincoln family. 

Striking similarity to a '95 Mitsubishi Diamante made me love this vehicle even more. First we tried the V8 mated with a five speed automatic that could be shifted like a manual as well. A rather common feature found in more and more vehicles these days, did not find it to be very easy to shift gears at low rev situations. Since I am looking for a car with a manual transmission, I was more interested in the V6s with the manual tranny. After sometime, I was brought an LS with a manual transmission. While I started drooling over this brand new piece of machinery, the sales people were struggling to open the rear doors as something must have stopped functioning properly. I guess the car was already due for its first stop over at the dealership even before it got out of one. After several people were involved, they were finally able to open the rear doors for us. 

Lincoln LS seemed like a beautiful car with adequately spacious interior. The dash layout was surprisingly attractive considering it is an American car. After all, they will have to go a long way before they can create something that is as luxurious as a Lexus or as practical as a Honda. The seats seemed very comfortable as well as provided adequate lateral support for sporty driving. 

The V6 made a sweet note when I pushed it hard. The 17&quot; wheels (as far as I can remember) and sport suspensions really did make a lot of difference. This is the particular area (along with the availability of the five speed transmission) that made me think that this car will really make an attempt to fight with the sporty imports that dominate the minds of some of us that enjoy driving.

I believe my short stay at the Lincoln dealership at Plano was also quite enjoyable. The Indian gentleman was very informative. He knew about his car. Since we were invited to test drive the LS, he never &quot;tried&quot; to get us behind an LS that very night. The dealership was nicely decorated, almost like a Lexus dealership. To my greatest surprise, I was told that there would not be a free loaner car when the car would be in for service (I always get free loaner car even when my Lexus gets an oil change). 

Compared to other vehicles in its class, the LS will always be less expensive. If they can prove it to be more reliable and durable, it should have a bright future.<br><br>
