            </b>A couple of coupons and a rebate -- which brought my end cost under $15 -- lured me into buying this contraption.  I was tired of waiting for rolls of film to be used up and developed, and figured this was a good way to experiment with digital photography.  (I was even willing to carry the silly-looking thing around, despite having no children to blame it on!)  Unfortunately, I have been very disappointed.

When I received the camera, I eagerly went out and snapped a few photos of some home improvements we had done.  Then, so I could upload the images, I proceeded to install the Disney Pooh software that came with the camera.  What a memory hog!  I'm still limping along on an old P1/100mhz with not much RAM; which made Pooh like the proverbial man who came for dinner!  

For one thing, it goes full-screen, overwriting the toolbar, whether you want it to or not (which I didn't).  Then you have to sit thru a graphic-intensive (read: S - L - O - W) intro... only to get to an all-picture interface.  I want my menus and instructions in <i>English</i>, thank you very much!  (Yeah, I know, the software was intended for kids.  Bah humbug!  Would it have hurt them to have pictures for the kids *and* a menu bar for mom and dad?)  I don't know how much time I wasted, just trying to figure out which artist's rendering would lead me to the "upload" function.  It was probably an hour before I gave up in frustration.  Then came the final insult -- in true Disney fashion, the darn thing goes through movie-style "credits" -- <i>with a full musical score</i> -- before it will sign off!!  <i>There is no way to stop them.</i>  They hold your computer hostage.  It's like watching grass grow!

I went to CNet and downloaded a freebie photo editor, then had another go at the upload... with no luck.  My USB port was dead!  (Hmm, time to write an opinion about Compaq?)  My husband was finally able to extract the images on his laptop computer.  

All the hulaballoo we went through to get to them, made the final product twice as disappointing.  Large shapes are recognizable, but are fuzzy and have little detail; and the colors are very washed-out.  If you have ever moved a little while taking a picture at dusk, that is about what these look like.  Also, what you see in the viewfinder is not quite what ends up in the actual picture.  It is difficult to get your intended subject centered in the frame.

I'm relieved that I didn't spend any more than I did on this camera -- in a way, I still feel like I spent too much.  I'm going to try amannuc's suggestion for a fix; but if that doesn't work, JamCam will probably be headed for the landfill (OK, the closet shelf -- I'm a pack rat).  My conscience won't allow me to put it on eBay -- or even donate it to charity!
