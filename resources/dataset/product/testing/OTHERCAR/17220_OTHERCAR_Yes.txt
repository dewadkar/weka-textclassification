            Yes oh yes, I drove this car for two years of my life. Untill the end, I really have very few complaints about this car. It ran well. I was fairly quick. It was a convertible. And the gas mileage was decent. If you are looking for a good reliable safe car, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a sporty little car this may be the one for you. I drove the car back and forth from Arizona to Los Angeles many times with no hassel, or break downs. That car really was a fun little toy. The only problem was, when it started to go. It went quick. So I guess I would recommend it, but only if you realize that it is a fun car, not the most reliable, but fun.<br><br>
