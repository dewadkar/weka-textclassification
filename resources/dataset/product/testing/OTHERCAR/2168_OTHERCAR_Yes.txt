            It took me about 2 months to find an Agfa CL34 (1.3M pixels).  Had to order from www.henrys.com in Toronto to get one.  It was worth it.  Great cam for the $.  Digital Cam, Movies, and Webcam.  Only slight problem is that the camera does not have a built in microphone.

Great cam for the $.  But, if you are reading this around mid-year 2001, check out Kodak DX3500 and DX3600.  Also, Sony DSC-S75.  These will be more expensive but worth it if you have the $.  I don't think these are webcams.  But should be very good for high res pics and low res movies with sound.

For now (as of April 2001), the Agfa CL34 is terrific for the $.  There may be a CL45 (2.1M pixels) in the future.  Nice quality pictures and easy to use and flexible software.  Hopefully, it will be available from US suppliers soon.  I got lucky.  It took less than a day to get here from Henry's in Canada.  Canadian warranty, but that's okay.  There is a Canadian rebate on the Agfa Canada site. I will send in the rebate and see if they send me a check in the U.S. since I bought it in Canada.  I paid a premium to get the camera now, but it was worth it!  Price shown includes rebate.

Where is it available in the U.S.?

Please let me know your experiences.

Thanks,
Alan
