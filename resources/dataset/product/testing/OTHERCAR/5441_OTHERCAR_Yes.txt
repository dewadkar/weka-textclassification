            PROS: Very affordable; Reasonable power; Well-tuned suspension; Super warranty; Well-equipped with standard features; Huge cargo space; Great styling; (purple gauge!); Alloy wheels; Good tires; 4-doors; Did I mention very affordable?

CONS: 20 more HP, and this car would be perfect! Also, I have noticed that rear-view visibility is a little limited.
--------

First off, I'm speaking of the GT model. I have no idea about the GLS.

I, like many other people, have always consider Hyundai to produce flimsy, unreliable cars. My first encounter of the Elantra GT was in the November 2001 Road and Track magazine, where it received a very favorable review. At the time, I was considering something along the lines of the Sentra Spec-V or even the Subaru WRX. However, I value things like leather interior, and neither of those cars even provides that as an option. They do, however, provide much more performance.

My second encounter with the Elantra GT was at an auto show, where I also saw the Sentra Spec-V and the Subaru WRX. I was very much impressed with the Elantra's styling, inside and out. Compared to the other more expensive hatchbacks in the show (Ford Focus, VW GTI, Mercedes' new hatchback, etc), the Elantra more than holds its own. Basically, I could not see why this car costs MANY THOUSANDS less than those other cars.

I'm not going to go into detail with the standard features of the car, since you can read them in the specs. But the most impressive parts are the standard leather interior/shift knob/steering wheel, the front side airbags, and the HUGE cargo space (twice the cargo space of the Elantra GLS).

Now I own a red Elantra GT with moonroof, but no ABS. I couldn't find a car with ABS that's in a color I like, but that's okay since I live in sunny California (BTW, the Cardinal Red is hideous, but the Rally Red is beautiful; know the difference). The car is very reasonably peppy, has great handling, and my favorite feature may be the purple gauges, which I didn't know about until I bought it. Nice bonus!
