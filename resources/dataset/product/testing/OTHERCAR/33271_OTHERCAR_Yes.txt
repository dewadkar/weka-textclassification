            We bought our Voyager about 3 months ago.  My wife was in our home town, about a 6-hour drive away, for her baby shower.  We were expecting our fourth.  We really needed a van, because our Corsica was too small when we had our third child.  

We had done a little research on the kind of van we wanted, and had decided on a Grand Voyager or Grand Caravan.  On a whim, my wife and her parents visited a local dealer to see if they had something we might like.  Our van was there.  They test drove it and my wife decided it was the one she wanted.  At $10,000, it was the best price we had seen for this model.

Two days later she arrived back home with the van.  It was not a Grand Voyager, so it had less room in the back.   But there is still plenty of room for our children to spread out, and just enough room behind the back seat for luggage.  They really enjoyed the trip back home.

I took it for a test drive, which wasn't quite that because we had already bought the van.  I was pleased with the comfort of the driver's seat.  I also liked being a little higher over the road and being able to see so much through the huge windshield.  It handles well around town (for a van).  The first thing I noticed, though, was that the engine was "spark knocking," which is the metallic popping sound an engine makes when it is lugging.  The engine was not lugging when it made this noise, so I was not pleased with that.  We have an appointment with our mechanic to get the timing corrected and get a tune up, and hopefully that will clear up this problem.

After a couple of days, I noticed spots of oil forming under the engine.  I found that the drip was originating between the engine and transaxle.  It turned out to be a leaky rear main seal, which is a very expensive repair.  Our dealer agreed to pay half of the repair if we would bring the van back to him.  We took the 6-hour drive and got it fixed.  Our half of the bill ended up being about $250.  

The rear right strut is really noisy, which we will fix when our budget allows.  It squeaks like rubber-on-rubber, and is very annoying.  

The least pleasant thing about driving this van is climbing hills with a full load.  At higher speeds it will maintain speed, but below about 70 mph on a hill we have to drop it down a gear.  However, it is not a huge inconvenience.  

The seats are very easy to remove, but once they are detached they weigh a ton.  I'm no whimp, but I had a really hard time lifting the back seat back into the van.  

Aside from the moderate mechanical problems, we really enjoy our new van.  When the problems are fixed, we will enjoy it much more.  It has a nice, smooth ride and is fairly pleasant to drive.  We enjoy the extra room and the decent gas mileage as well.  It looks pretty nice, and the finish keeps its shine.
