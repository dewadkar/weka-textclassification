            Ten years ago I owned a 1985 Astro and decided to buy yet another Astro last year.  I found a used 1997 LT (Luxury Touring) model that had 72k miles and bought it.  I bought the Astro because I really wanted a large vehicle that I could haul the occasional bicycle or extra large item, or to even camp out in.  I love the extra room, the truck like ride, high seating position to view the road, and overall flexibility of the van.  Great for hauling outdoor sporting equipment.  Some or all of the rear seats can be removed for awesome hauling, or left in if your cargo of choice tends to be people.  The Astro is a perfect size for many people - smaller than full size vans but larger/tougher than the car-based minivans.  

Chevy made a few changes to this vehicle since its inception in 1985, but unfortunately they failed to address some key issues which have plagued the Astro and has led to such horrible reviews over the years.  Flimsy plastic vacuum control tubing which breaks from normal engine heat, cheap pot metal handles and body hardware that breaks off easily, and cheap plastic intake manifold gaskets that have led to serious issues with cooling system and engine breakdown.  Using better quality parts could have saved GM a lot of customers who were turned off by reliability/quality issues.

The negatives are possibly too much of a burden for some, but it depends on what kind of person you are.  If you don't mind working on the van yourself and have a bit of mechanical knowledge, most things are relatively easy and cheap to fix.  For example the $6 cheap plastic hose that controls the heater fan which is notorious for breaking.  Someone who takes their vehicle in for repairs for every little thing might find it too much, in terms of inconvenience and the added cost of having a mechanic do the work.  Also, the cooling system needs to be checked frequently because low coolant levels can lead to degrading of the the cheap plastic intake manifold gaskets, which is a huge expense to get fixed.  Carbon build up is very common with Astros, leading to glogged EGR valves, throttle bodies, and fuel injectors.  I recommend routine use of gas treatment when filling the gas tank to prevent carbon build up.  I also recommend not getting the AWD unless you really need it for snow and ice.  The added weight, complexity, expense, and decreased gas mileage with the AWD system was a turn off for me, so I got a 2WD model.
