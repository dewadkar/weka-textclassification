            I own a small painting business and needed a van to work out of.  I looked around at the vehicles in my area and saw lots of dodge trucks and vans.  I assumed they must be good if there were so many around, thus I purchased a new 1997 ram van 2500.
I love the AC, sound system, and seats in my cargo van.  After these,there is alot to be desired.  AC works excellent and cools vehicle fast and efficient.  Radio and cassette has four speakers and sounds like higher priced models.  Both front seats are bucket with arms and tall backs and with me being 6'2&quot; fit me quite well with no backache or cramping.  
There are quite a few things I do not like about the van and the service that Dodge stands behind.  The right rear door when opened can be opened to the point where it swings open and can break the left rear taillight.   This has happened twice since I have owned my vehicle.  The ride in the van is horrible for such a supposedly well built vehicle.  Cruise control has not worked since I have had the vehicle...even after having it brought to the attention of the service department of the dealership.  Drivers seatbelt also does not work correctly after being checked by service department.
There are a number of other small problems with vehicle that have been addressed by service department.
I have missed over 7 days of work for problems with vehicle that should not have happened and do not recommend this van to anyone.  
After writing one card and one letter to customer service never heard from company in either of two cases.  <br><br>
