            I recently drove a Cirrus as a rental car while another Chrysler car was being serviced. I didn't expect it to be a really great car, just about what my Acclaim is. I was wrong! The Cirrus does feel like a luxury car on the inside. I wouldn't say it is as nice as a Audi, Infiniti or BMW, but it is a step up from a Ford or Chevy. The power seats are a very nice touch that add to this luxurious profile. They are easy to understand and use, and really help you adjust the seats to your exact comfort level. 

The rest of the interior is also nice. The climate and sound controls are very simple to understand and the buttons and rotor controls are fairly logical. The speedometer/tachymeter/etc. are in a neon orange which is actually a little hard to look at, I prefer white, but orange is really not a good color. The back seat is very large. I found the back to be about as large if not larger than the NEW Ford Taurus. The head room is a little better (at least it feels better) and the legroom is really quite spacious. 

The suspension and handling weren't as good as the Ford Contour, but weren't terrible. The car is nimble, and moves well. The engine, which in this model was a 2.4L dual overhead cam four-cylinder which was very powerful. When I first started to drive this car, I thought that it was the V-6 model. The engine wasn't real loud under heavy acceleration either. The transmission doesn't indicate the gear you are in on the actual stick, it is below the speedometer. This is good if the shift is near the wheel, but in this case, it was just confusing. 

The new Cirrus (now called the Sebring Sedan) will be on sale in the coming weeks. While I haven't driven it, I have read that it is better in almost every way over the older model. If this is the case, I would highly recommend considering it for your next family car.<br><br>
