            Pros:  Sporty, excellent braking and handling, turns on rails, 30 MPG+, cheap to maintain, reliable, parts readily available, customizable, unique, very technologically advanced for an '89 design

Cons:  cargo space, very low riding (hard to see over big vehicles), does not accept most infant carseats, unforgiving to those who refuse to check and replace the timing belt on time

The '90-'94 DSM (Diamond Star Motors) (Talon, Eclipse, Laser) cars had four flavors, covering a broad spectrum of driver tastes:

The Base Eclipse (no Talon equivalent), with a 1.8L engine was a pretty econobox which got excellent mileage but was severely underpowered.

The GS (Talon ES) which had a 2.0L DOHC engine making 135HP and getting about 30MPG highway

The GS-T (Talon ESi)which was the same engine, only turbocharged and making 195 HP stock and still managing good mileage (though requiring premium gas)

The GSX (Talon TSi) which was the turbocharged model with an advanced AWD system which was way ahead of its time (and still is)

I currently own a '94 GS with 120,000 miles on it.  I bought it used with about 54,000 miles on it.  It's a bright white with black top.  It is a beautiful car, inside and out.  If you treat these Japanese-engineered works of art with proper maintenance and respect, you can expect high mileage and a long life with great performance.  I suggest synthetic oil every 3,000 miles.  You must also check the timing belt REGULARLY for wear and proper tension.  This is so very important because this belt works VERY HARD on the 2.0L engines, and because if it breaks, you will probably have at least 5-8 bent valves.  The manufacturer recommends replacement every 60K miles, I'd say have it checked every 15 or so to be on the safe side.  On the early DSM's this belt was recalled because it was not tough enough, which should clue you off to the importance of proper maintenance of this part.  

This is my second DSM.  My first was a '91 Talon TSi (Turbo AWD) which was the same exact color.  That car is (was for me) a real pavement-scorcher.  But this review is of my current car, the GS, so that's what I'll stick to.

I have had no reliability problems at all with this car.  I drive conservatively and pretty responsibly.  This car looks fast but if you treat it well and don't beat the crap out of it like most teenagers do, it will last a long, long time.  (Incidentally, the only problem I ever had with my first DSM was a leaky transfer case, but this was replaced free by the dealer through a recall).  The 135 HP engine is plenty for a car that only weighs 2500 lbs., though I sometimes pine for the old TSi which was capable of making my stomach churn at every red light.

The cockpit controls are well-placed and work well.  The ergonomics are excellent.  Steering is tight and very smooth.  The suspension is wonderful; any DSM, Turbo or non, will ride straight and smooth at 120MPH+.  Alignments are needed infrequently because the only adjustment that can be made is Toe-in.  

This is not a family truckster.  The rear seat is so very hard to climb into and most infant seats simply don't work with the rear buckets and 3-point belts.  The low ride makes it very difficult to see around SUV's and trucks.  Despite these shortcomings, it is very fun to drive and hugs the road.  You can take corners twice as fast as the aforementioned road pigs.  I know because I own one of those, too.  I find this car infinitely more fun to drive on pavement and much easier on the wallet.  It spoils me and then I have to retrain myself to drive my Explorer.  No more hard cornering, no more super-tight turning radius.  Still, each vehicle has its place, and the Eclipse is just an all-around, fun, sporty, fuel efficient, daily driver for 2.  No kids, luggage, or groceries.  A perfect commuter vehicle.
