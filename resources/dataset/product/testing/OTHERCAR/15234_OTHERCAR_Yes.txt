               I bought the Acura Integra in my sophomore year in college kept it till graduation.  Therefore I believe that my three years of driving this machine has truly given me great insight on this vehicle. Firstly the Integra that I had was the LS version, which is the base model.  However even this model comes well equipped with cassette player and automatic windows and side view mirrors.  The car is absolutely fabulous to drive.  The drive is firm yet not rigid, and the handling is so good that the driver feels extremely confident about most turns in fair weather.  I drove the car through the winters of Boston, and it gave me no problems.  The batteries never died out over winter and the car never had any mechanical problems.  This car is perfect for college as it even handles a lot of stuff as it has fold down seats.  I have literally handled all my dorm and apartment moving with the Integra.
   The only problems that I ever had with the Acura in over three years of driving it were a faulty cup holder and a weird noise which came when I applied the brakes.  The cup holder was fixed under warranty by the dealer.  The other problem occurred due to the fact that I had kept the car at the college parking lot over winter.  Therefore the snow had caused a layer of rust to build over the disc brakes.  The mechanic told me that the problem would erode away in a few days of driving, and it did.
   Other than that it was smooth sailing.  The car was always a pleasure to drive as although it didn't have the VTEC engine that comes with the top of the line versions the engine was definitely  powerful.  It gave out more than 140 hp and was more than enough for me.  The back seats held two passengers in a bearable state unlike other two door cars, whose back seats and leg space are not even capable of handling toddlers.  The Integra is a great car for your money.  The only thing that I may advise against it is that Acura has not changed the shape since 94, therefore I believe its only a matter of time that they will introduce a completely revamped model.   Although I believe that the shape is sill very stylish.<br><br>
