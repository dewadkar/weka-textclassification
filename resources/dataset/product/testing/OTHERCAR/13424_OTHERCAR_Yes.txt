            We recently purchased a 1996 Chevy Blazer. The price was good the mileage was low compared to the newer Blazers. The newer Blazers were selling for 25-29 thousand. We purchased a 1996 for 18 thousand and it had 40 thousand miles on it. We haven't experienced any mechanical problems with the blazer. The room in the blazer is a blessing when you have two little passengers in the family. If you have more then two kids I would recommend stepping up a size to the suburban. It was only four thousand dollars more then the new blazer and almost twice the room. Our blazer is the 4 door 4 wheel drive. The 4 wheel drive is push button on the dash so it is easily accessible and convenient. The blazer gets 17-24 mpg on the freeway so the mileage is pretty good. If you want to go from a car to a suv i would recommend the blazer.<br><br>
