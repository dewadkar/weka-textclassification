            This van has been nothing but trouble over the last year and I wish that we had the money to replace it.  First of all, the transmission went in March and had to be replaced which cost a fortune.  When I had it inspected in June they replaced the brakes which now need to be replaced again five months later because when I go down a hill or stop too quickly the whole thing starts to shudder violently.  The clock/stereo has stopped working and yesterday we went to release the emergency brake cable and the handle came off!  Now we have no emergency brake because the AAA guy had to cut the cable to release the brake.

Also I hate driving it in the winter.  I feel very uncomfortable on slick roads, maybe because I'm used to a manual transmission which gives you so much more control over the car.  In this thing I feel like an accident waiting to happen.

Not only are there mechanical problems but the thing costs so much money fill up, especially in the summer when I'm running the AC and the mileage is terrible.  I try not to use it except on really hot days but why even have a vehicle with AC if you can't afford to run it?  

I swore I would never drive a minivan and got talked into it by my mechanic who said it was the safest thing to drive.   I'm so sorry I let him convince me to buy this piece of junk.  I'm living for the day when I can get rid of it and buy a car again.
