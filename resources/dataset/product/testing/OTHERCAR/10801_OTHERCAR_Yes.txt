            <b>SUMMARY</B>

The Fuji 40i delivers appeal wherever I take it.  Although it may be lacking some features found in other digital cameras in this price range, additional features (such as its ability to record movie clips and play mp3 audio) definitely makes up for this shortfall.  Because of these additional features, the 40i belongs to a class of its own.  The 40i has grown on me, it has acquired a �must-have� status along with my Palm PDA and cell phone, I never leave home without my 40i and a set of extra batteries.  It is become a part of my regular lifestyle.

Keep in mind that I am not really into photography.  In terms of 40i being a digital camera, it delivers average performance.  However, it is definitely adequate for everyday point and shoot.

<B>PROS</B>

-the unit is surprisingly small and this makes it highly portable � at the same time, the 40i fits comfortably in your hand whether you are carrying it or capturing a few shots

-overall, the unit seems solid with quality construction, the buttons on the unit are functional, logical, and easy to use

-ready to go right out of the box: charge the high quality 1600 mAh nickel metal hydride rechargeable AA batteries with the supplied charger, pop them into the unit and you�re ready to go

-nice bright LCD monitor to see what you�re shooting

-the 40i on auto setting is a no brainer, just point and shoot

-manual capture allows for flash, macro, and white balance tweaking

-great documentation and software supplied

-video features: the 40i is capable of capture 80 second video clips with sound � at first, I found it quite strange but after playing with it a little, you�d be surprised at how much one can film, i use this feature 70% of the time!

-playback is surprisingly smooth on the little monitor, the 40i has a built in speaker that is loud enough for some real time play back in noisy environments.  It reminds of watching mpeg files on a Windows-based Pocket PC PDA

-speedy USB connectivity, the 40i becomes a removable drive when plugged into my desktop PC

-technically, one could use the 40i as a mobile storage solution such as an Iomega ZIP drive although I am unsure if it affects the smart media.  Try at your own risk

-the unit comes with a remote control for mp3 audio playback controls; it doubles as a digital camera control for snapping shots

-has a standard tripod mount opening

-did I mention that the unit is sleek?  It comes in a baby metallic blue to really stand out from the crowd

<B>CONS</B>

-to take full advantage of the 40i, one might have to invest more dollars on additional accessories: leather case ($13), 64 meg smart media to store more mp3�s or capture more video clips or pictures ($130), additional rechargeable batteries ($5/ each), AC adapter ($30), etc.

-the 40i can chew up alkaline batteries fast, I don�t suggest using alkaline batteries at all unless it�s an emergency

-poor camera cover design, a lot my friends with similar units have had problems the automatic lens cover not being able to close

-no digital zoom, it does have minimal zoom capabilities but negligible

-the zoom function disappears altogether when image quality is cranked up

-some users may find the buttons a little small

-unlike the unit itself, the remote control looks and feels
low quality

-very poor quality headphone supplied, worst then them old school gameboy ear buds

-memory: my 40i came with a 16 meg smart media for less then average storage space, 

-cannot change batteries or smart media if mounted on tripod

-only supports mp3 files encoded at 128kpbs

-mp3 playback feature is limited, it has the basic bass boost, track skip, repeat and volume controls, does not support mp3 tag information

-the system has a funny little mp3 copyright protection method called �InfoBind�, this means that one cannot simply load to the unit and transfer to a different computer

-slow operation on macro mode

-batteries take 13 hours for a full charge *yawn*
