            I drive sports cars competitively, but needed a small wagon due to a recent family addition.  After careful research and test drives, the WRX Sportwagon stood head-and-shoulders above the competition.

The WRX Sportwagon drives like a real sport sedan.  It has acceleration and handling combined with the safety of All Wheel Drive.  It's not a sports car, but it does have a real back seat and storage area that neither of my RX-7s can offer.

Subarus are practical cars with a good reliability record, but the price was the clincher.  The WRX competes with the Audi A4 and BMW 325ix wagon for $10,000 less.  2002 "leftovers" are (were) available for <b>LESS THAN dealer cost</b>, even though there are no changes for 2003 (excepting an illuminated ignition switch and dual vanity mirrors in the visor).  I got my WRX Sportwagon for under $22k, and can't believe what a good value it is.

The "base" WRX comes fully equipped with equipment that is optional on some of its competition (A/C, power windows, power locks, remote entry, cruise control, fog lights, in-dash 6 CD changer).  You can read the specs and reviews in all the popular car magazines to hear the praise for the WRX.  The latest Grassroots Motorsports featured a test between FWD, RWD and AWD.  The WRX sedan beat the BMW 330i and Acura RSX Type-S in dry handling and ate their lunch in the wet handling test.

Complaints?  Almost none.  The shifter is a bit notchy, but will likely loosen up over time.  Otherwise, the car has been perfect; a real blast to drive.

For the price, there simply is no competition when it comes to performance, utility and overall value.  It's not the biggest "small wagon" available, but if the size fits your needs, there is no better choice.
