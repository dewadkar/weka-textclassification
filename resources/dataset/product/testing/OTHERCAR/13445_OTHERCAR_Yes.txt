            I bought my 91 Blazer mainly to use for surf-fishing along the outer banks of North Carolina. It`s a great truck for this purpose as it is well centered for use in the sand and has plenty of torque. My truck had a bad engine in it when I bought it used 4 years ago and I had a 99 factory engine installed from my Chevrolet dealer. Also went ahead and had everything firewall-forward replaced. So essentially now I have a new truck that is very dependable. 
It is very versatile in that I can remove the back seat to put fishing gear in the back in case of bad weather. It also is a great truck for towing due to the tremendous amount of torque offered by the 350. After the new engine was installed I had a new cat and Flowmaster muffler installed as well as a K&amp;N air filter. I get good throttle response and better fuel mileage with this settup...about 17 on the highway.
This truck is pretty stable on the road or off-road considering it is a high-profile vehicle. Rides well for a truck of this size. I have Dunlop radials on it,31x18.5`s. A little larger than stock but well worth the price for off-roading in the sand.
This truck is a good choice for anyone who loves the outdoors and enjoys getting off the path.  <br><br>
