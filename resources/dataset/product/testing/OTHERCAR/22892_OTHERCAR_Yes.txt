            To be fair, I should say up front that I have a 1989 240SX, not a 1990. However, any '89 manufactured after January of 1989 is identical to a 1990, so I feel I'm fairly well qualified to opine.

First of all, I'd like to dispel the myth that this is a &quot;chick&quot; car. While there are any number of women who drive and enjoy the car, it's no Geo Metro. While somewhat lacking in horsepower (especially for us previous V8 fanatics) it has some of the best handling for a USDM (That's US Domestic Market) vehicle that we've seen yet. If you're looking for an inexpensive and upgradable sports car built on a solid platform and capable of taking a porsche on the twisties, this is the vehicle for you. The 1989 240SX actually has better numbers on the skidpad and for momentary Gs than a 1989 Porsche 944 due to its strut front and 5-link rear suspension.

It's easy to see how the 240SX follows in the footsteps of the original Z cars. The vehicle is built for low weight, not for comfort, yet manages to not be so bad even on long drives - And I weigh over 300 pounds. It also has ample legroom, though I do have to crack the sunroof if I want to sit up straight. Then again, I'm 6'7&quot;. If I can drive this car, nearly anyone can drive this car.

Due to the low weight (2750 lbs.) this car is snappy off the line even with its limited 145 crank hp. There's a plethora of aftermarket hopup parts available, partially due to the fact that the 180SX (What the 240SX fastback is called in Japan) is possibly the most popular drift racing car in its home nation. You can also purchase imported 1.8 liter or 2.0 liter turbo motors, and they are a direct drop-in; there are also turbo kits for both the SOHC motor found in the early models (like the 1990) and for the DOHC motor in the later ones. Imbued with a 2.4 liter I-4, this car has plenty of torque, even if it's a bit lacking in horsepower.

On the down side, the rear seat is commonly referred to as the &quot;Japanese Torture Trap&quot;. Anyone larger than a child will be exceptionally unhappy in it, especially in the fastback model; One's head tends to come in contact with either the roof or rear glass with unfortunate regularity. There are no cup holders, and popping out the ashtray (AKA coin holder) and putting your cup there has two unfortunate side effects; First, if your cup bursts you'll be pouring liquid into an enclosed space containing some relatively minor portions of your electrical system, and second, it makes it very hard to operate the shift lever. Also, over time the electric door locks (if so equipped) have sometimes quirky behavior, which may necessitate getting in and working on it, or a visit to the shop.<br><br>
