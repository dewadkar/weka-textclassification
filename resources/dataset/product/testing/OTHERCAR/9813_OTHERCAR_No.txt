            First of all, a confession....I actually drove the Mazda 323F, which is the hatchback version of the Protege that is not sold in the USA, but putting that aside, this review will concentrate on my experiences with this vehicle.

I will start off with what I liked; which was the very spacious and user-friendly interior.  At long last Mazda has learnt how to make high-quality interiors that don't resemble the aftermath of an explosion in a plastic factory.  The seat fabrics and carpets are made from good quality materials and the plastic moldings are equally well textured and chunky looking.  But while the "plasticky" Japanese look may have gone, the dashboard is ergonomically flawed with switches scattered all over the place, some low down and out of sight.  The Protege also loses marks for its angle-only adjusting steering wheel and low ceiling.  Mind you the luggage area is generous, as is rear seat space, and I am not going to complain about the excellent air conditioning, hi-fi system and clear, easy-to-read instruments.

But sadly don't expect any rushes of adrenaline from behind the wheel.  As soon as the engine is started you notice unpleasant vibrations coming through the gear stick, the pedals and the floor.  And that gearshift....the manual shifter feels rubbery and imprecise and is not a pleasure to use at all.  At least the clutch feeds in progressively, and throttle reponse from the 1.6 litre, twin-cam 16-valve engine is willing enough if not fantastic.

Handling is safe and secure, but never exciting.  The tiller is lifeless and dead, and it just doesn't encourage you to drive the Mazda with any degree of gusto at all.  

But if all you want is a solid, dependable runaround to drive to the grocery store, then you could do a lot worse, the Protege is well made, reliable and easy to live with, but in the crucial areas of driving enjoyment and refinement, it lags behind the class leader - the Ford Focus, which is where I recommend you put your money if you are a keen driver.
