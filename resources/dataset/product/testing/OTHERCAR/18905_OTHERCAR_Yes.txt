                 I am a fifty-year-old legal secretary and realtor driving a 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee that I bought in 1994.  This was my third Jeep Cherokee and I will drive this one until it &quot;gives up the Ghost.&quot;  It presently has over 140,000 miles on it, but still has the power and pep of a youngster (kind of like its owner!).  I take it to my Jeep dealer for service and would recommend that women do the same.....but do your homework and take it to a dealer that you trust.  I have replaced a lot of the parts that normal wear and tear requires, but that is to be expected with maintaining any car for this length of time.  The important thing to me is that I can drive in any weather with confidence (as opposed to fear).  When others say they will not go out somewhere because it is supposed to snow that evening, I scoff and say &quot;I'm going.....I drive a Jeep.&quot;                                                         

     The other consideration is the class and comfort of this car.....I am a realtor and often am required to drive prospective buyers around in my vehicle.  I call it my travelling office....with phone and CD player.  I highly recommend this car to anyone.  And when this one dies, I will immediately look for another Cherokee to take its place.
