            If you are like me you are on a limited budget.  Therefore you are looking to get the most car for your dollar.  Look no further!
The Saturn S-Series has is surprisingly roomy, has plenty of acceleration, fantastic gas mileage, quality service, stylish looks, and most important of all a great price and great financing.
Saturn is a car company that succeeds by delivering a quality product, keeping customers happy, all at a remarkably low price.
Comparable prices exist in cars like the Focus, Elantra, and Daewoo Nubira, but none have the total package.  Ford delivers an unreliable car, Hundai has poor service and a poor track record, and Daewoo has no track record to speak of.
The only con for the S-Series is its lack of horsepower.  Although it is enough to get around town and highways, when you try to pass a truck going up a mountain you have to drop down a gear and floor it.
Overall I give it a thumbs up to anyone looking to get a good car for a low price.  This car's monthly payments are so low it is as if you bought a used car, due to the great financing and great price.
