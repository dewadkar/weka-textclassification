                  I was on a waiting list for nearly a year, and this car was worth it.  I have never driven a car that delivers more smiles per gallon than this roadster.  It seems to be an extension of my reflexes when zipping through the curves and revving like crazy to 9000 RPM.  The car is mild mannered up to 6000 rpm at which point the VTEC takes over and the engine starts to sing like a Super-bike on the banks of Daytona.  It takes a while to get used to winding this car up to speeds that would explode any other engine, but once you get used to holding a gear two thousand more revs than normal, the car is a blast.
      Handling is fantastic.  The rear end will step out on you especially on cold tires, but is as easy to modulate the slide as a go cart.  The ride is firm but not uncomfortable at all,  and lets you feel with the seat of your pants what's happening around corners, very rare in a street car.  There is no cowl shake and only a few squeaks from the top can be heard with it up,  none when the top is down.
      The power top goes down quickly and Honda took great care in designing the ventilation system that allows for a comfortable cabin in all but the worst of conditions.  The optional windscreen works well especially with the windows up to allow conversation at highway speeds and wind buffeting reduced as well.
       Styling is a matter of opinion but I feel it looks better than the XKE that I have loved since a child.  The car attracts rubberneckers like you wouldn't believe.  One dislike I have about the car is I'm afraid to leave it sit in a public place for long because there will be a crowd around the car when I get back.
        Other dislikes would be no clock, which isn't a big deal, and the plastic rear window that scratches easy.  The spare cannot be used on the rear wheels because the size difference could damage the differential so in the event of a rear flat, the spare must be put on the front and then the front can be installed on the rear.  At least it has a spare. 
        Small nits compared to the overall package.  I would highly recommend this car to anyone who enjoys driving and wants a dependable car that will run circles around vehicles costing twice the price.  Killer engine, F1 style cockpit, race worthy handling, stunning looks and Honda reliability at a price thousands less than any rival,  who could ask for more?<br><br>
