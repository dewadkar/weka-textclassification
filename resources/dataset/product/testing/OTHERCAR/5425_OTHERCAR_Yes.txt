            The Chrysler Corp. seems to be struggling a bit.  It�s not for a lack of good products, certainly Dodge trucks have etched themselves on our collective consciousness as tough and durable alternatives to Chevy or Ford. And the Dodge Viper consistently makes the top ten where performance is concerned. The Jeep Liberty is a ten fold improvement over the Cherokee it replaces. But what about the sedans � names like Sebring, Stratus, Intrepid, and Concorde don�t seem to ring any bells with many consumers.  Again, not for a lack of good products � those cars are all fine choices, but seem to suffer from an anonymity of sorts.

A perfect case in point is the Chrysler 300M.  Typically, Chryslers have been more about luxury than performance.  The 300M seeks to blend the two in keeping with the heritage of Chrysler�s �letter cars� of the 50s and 60s. Granted, the number 300 used to be an indication of horsepower, but times change.  Chrysler�s latest 300, the 300M, is an attractive and well balanced performance sedan similar in execution to an Acura or Infinity.  The problem with Chrysler is that no Acura or Infinity customers seem to be cross shopping the 300M with the I35 or TL. There�s no GOOD reason for this, other than the fact that the name �Chrysler� lacks the name recognition or panache of an Acura, Infinity, or even Lexus. Lets face it, when a consumer hears the name �Acura,� they are not confused with thoughts of minivans or mid priced convertibles. The name Acura means a few, specific things � luxury combined with performance and reliability. Chrysler should do the same. Give all the minivans and mid priced sedans and convertibles to Dodge, and let Chrysler stand as a premium brand that balances performance and luxury.

Global product strategy aside, the 300M is quite a capable car. It does, in fact, blend performance and luxury, and does it very well. Inside the 300M are nice, little touches of class such as the white faced gauges with chrome rings around them, an analog clock with the same chrome treatment, and a beautiful wood an leather steering wheel. Although the steering wheel has many cruise control buttons, they do not light up at night, forcing the driver to take his/her eyes off the road for just a second. The instrument cluster glows in a backlit neon bluish tint that feels both modern and retro at the same time. The luxury side of this car is obvious. Leather seats are soft, but the leather lacks the quality feel of a Cadillac, Lexus or even a Toyota. Two person memory sets not only the seats, but mirrors, and radio stations as well (including the steering wheel in the memory settings would be even better).  Rear seat leg room is excellent, rivaling even the much larger Cadillac Deville, head room is also excellent. Climate control buttons are simple, straightforward and easy to reach. Audio controls are a little more confusing and seem to lack the ergonomic thoughtfulness found on many Japanese cars, but an in-dash CD changer is a welcome feature on any car. Overall the dash is well laid out, and conveys a simple elegance. The main detractor inside the 300M is the overuse of cheap looking and feeling plastic. While much of the interior has a quality feel, much of the dash and console area seem cheap by comparison.  

On the road, the 300M lives up to its performance heritage with firm suspension and plenty of power. Sure, a 300M should have 300 hp, but 250 is plenty.  The 300M is powered by a 3.5 liter V6, and while 250 hp is, in fact plenty, this car lacks the all out grunt of the MUCH more expensive Cadillac Seville STS. Still, acceleration is brisk, and the engine has a pleasing growl even under hard stomps on the gas.  The Chrysler�s V6 also has a sporty exhaust note, something that is noticeably lacking on other sport/luxury sedans such as the DeVille DTS, Lexus GS, and Infinity I35.  Hard cornering is nothing short of fun in the 300M, and while it�s easy to make  horsepower comparisons to Cadillacs costing $10-20,000 more, the 300M will out handle most any sedan with the possible exception of an Audi or BMW.  Comparing an Audi to a Chrysler? Surely the grumbling has begun, but the 300M isn�t just an appearance package, it�s really a stiff and sporty  car.  When pressed hard, the nose has a tendency to push in the corners, but such is the nature of front wheel drive cars. Remember, this is a car that can make spirited driving a blast, but still carry 5 adults comfortably. There is a slight price to pay for the 300M�s agile cornering ability.  On rough roads, the 300M�s ride seems a bit harsh, lacking the softness of an Acura or Lexus. However both Acura and Lexus sedans are prone to much more body roll than the 300.  

Continuing the sport theme is Chrysler�s Autostick, auto/manual transmission.  This shift-it-yourself automatic is one of more responsive systems of any car that is so equipped (with the possible exception of Porsche).  Once the Autostick mode has been selected, the shifting is precise and quick.  The shift lever itself has a quality feel, with virtually no excess �play� right to left. The only drawback to the Autostick is the clunkiness with which it slides into the Autostick gate, there is a bit of a catch when going back and forth between full automatic and Autostick that is slightly unnerving. To enter Autostick mode, the driver must shift into one extra notch below the �D� for drive, then move the lever right or left to move up or down a gear. In other auto/manual equipped cars such as the Kia Optima, the shift-it-yourself mode is entered by sliding the shifter to the right, then moving the lever up or down to select a higher or lower gear.  The type of system used in the Kia is much more intuitive � this is a minor point at best, and most drivers will quickly adapt to the Chrysler system with no complaint.

Overall the 300M is an under appreciated sport sedan that is worth considering when shopping for other sporty sedans.  BMW owners will likely not be swayed, but anyone considering a Lexus, Jaguar, Acura or Infinity owes it to themselves to test drive a 300M. The handling prowess will bring a smile to your face � it is an incredibly tight car. Even though the interior is not up to Lexus standards in terms of quality and comfort, it does have an elegance that is lacking in other American cars � even the DeVille�s interior seems bland by comparison. The 300M�s few shortcomings can be boiled down to just three. 1) too much road noise 2) some cheap interior pieces 3) no lights on the steering wheel mounted controls.  All told, the 300M is a good looking, roomy, somewhat affordable, sport sedan that offers a lot of sport with a little luxury.  Base price for the 300M is around $29,000. That does not include such extras as a sunroof or chrome wheels. The standard 300M is all you need to fulfill the sporting urge, but still retain the practicality of an everyday car.
