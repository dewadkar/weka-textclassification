            So for my first car as a teenager I needed a good and reliable car. Thinking in 5 years I will be in my 20's I should get a family car. Sure enough I had a family when I was 21. While my car had a few problems, a noise here, a noise there, it was a great car.

One day while going to the grocery store someone made a left hand turn in front of me and hit me head on. The sound, the smell, and the way my car ended up will always remain on my mind. My airbag went off and broke my nose. I had burns from the airbag on my arms. That is actually good if you consider the following: since it was a head on accident in most cases the engine comes in towards the legs and feet. Mine fell out. That's right, completely fell. I lost no leg room. I could easily have had more serious injury than my back, neck, wrist, and nose hurt, I could have been killed or had my legs broken. 

My daughter escaped the accident with only a scratch. 

Just a word of advice for all parents of young kids: if the airbags ever go out in the car with them in it, leave doors open. They pack gun powder in the airbags to help it to shoot out. The powder is thin and quickly fills up a small space. By the time I got to my daughter she was choking on the powder.

Thank you Saturn for helping to save my life. Ps. when I bought my car in '94 I bought it for 10,900. When my accident happened in '98 the insurance paid me 10,500. They definately keep their value!<br><br>
