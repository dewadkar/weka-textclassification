            My mother needed a digital camera for various uses, including a high quality camera for family photos and a specialty camera for professional uses (physics high speed pictures).

I looked around and time and time again the Nikon Coolpix 800 was favored over other cameras, and also claimed to be a lower priced Coolpix 900 (950, 990).

Our experience with this product has been great.  With both three different 640x480 modes and 3 different 1600x1200 (2.1 megapixel) modes, you can really choose your quality.  You can shoot anywhere from 400 pictures (low res) to around 4 on the highest quality setting on a 8MB card.

The battery life is okay, all digi-cams eat batterys.

My advice: You can't go wrong with this great camera.  <br><br>
