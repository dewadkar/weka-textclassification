            OK, let's get to the bottom line here!
I am relatively new to the computer world...everyday I run across something that I have no experience with while playing around on the computer. The digital cameras are no exception!!!
I recently borrowed a HP camera from my brother for a few days...I had no idea how to work the camera when I picked it up. Two days later when I returned it, I still had no idea how to work it! I could take pictures like you would with a normal camera but other than that I was lost!


Last week I borrowed a Kodak DC215 from a different relative. I LOVE this camera!!! You will find a list of the top five reasons a beginner should buy this camera listed below...

#1 I had no problem at all learning how to operate this camera. I even hooked it up to my computer without any glitches when I was ready to load the pics into my computer.

#2 The software that comes with the camera is easy to install and very incredibly easy to use. 

#3 I loved the fact that the lens cover is on a cord and dangles from the camera when not in use...it will never get lost! I am notorious for loosing things, ugh!

#4 It is made by Kodak...such a trusted brand when considering a camera.

#5 The price is right!!! These cameras can be purchased for under $300.00! How great is that?!?!



The one thing that I didn't care for was that I went through the batteries very quickly.
Solution...use rechargeable batteries so you don't spend your life savings keeping the camera in working order! 

I highly recommend this camera for those of you who are as digitally challenged as I am! Lol...there's hope for us yet!
