            My  1993 Mercury Sable was the best family car that I ever owned. Plenty of room for the kids and all the groceries, and very comfortable, and smooth riding,it was a  very reliable car.It was fully loaded with all the luxuries, such as A/C , power steering and power seats. power windows, am/fm/ stereo cassette, duel air bags, cruise control, tilt steering. It had a v6 motor so it wasn't all that great on gas. 
I would Highly recommend this car for someone with a family, it's not all that sporty or fast. It is dependable and economical for us with kids. This car would also be excellent on the road for long trips, such as vacations, and long business trips. The only thing I can say that I didn't like about the one that I purchased was the color, Never buy a White car with black interior. They are the worst to keep clean, regardless of how often you do it, White always looks dirty.
if I was going to go buy another car, I would definitely look for another Mercury Sable, just a different color. 
something that I just remembered about this car, that I thought that I should share with you, is that I owned this car for less then 1 year, and it was re-called three times.
