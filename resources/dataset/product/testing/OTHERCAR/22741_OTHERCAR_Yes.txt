            I really love Pontiac Grand Am I used to drive a 93 2 dr se.It was burgandy and it looked so great the interior was gray witch was cool, and it got alot of looks and everyone loved it and it also could get up there on speed it handels pretty good i want to get one you can find them cheap but they have alot of miles.It is not an expensive car i would recommend it for a first car or even your next car.I dont really like the new model the dash looks like a pair of boobs.It is still a great car and you have access to the trunck from the back seat witch can be good and it can be bad.I think a 93 with about 80,000 miles would cost about 4500 with 100,000 2900 even cheaper.I really really like this car!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>
