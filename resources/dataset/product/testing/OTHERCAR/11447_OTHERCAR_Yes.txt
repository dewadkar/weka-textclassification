            The Caravan SXT is a very nice van indeed. For the 2004 model year the Caravan comes in two trim levels, SE and SXT. (This review does not cover Grand Caravan or Cargo Van.) 

With the Caravan SE you'll get the four-cylinder engine (150 horsepower at 5,100 RPM and 165 pounds-feet of torque at 4,000 RPM), 15-inch steel wheels, air conditioning and a four-speaker stereo with a CD player. 

Upgrade to the Caravan SXT to gain the V6 engine (180 horsepower at 5,000 RPM with 210 pounds-feet of torque at 4,000 RPM); 16-inch alloy wheels; dual-zone air conditioning; power windows, door locks and heated mirrors; cruise control; a tilt steering wheel; a six-speaker stereo with cassette and CD players; second-row bucket seats; floor mats; and a cargo net to name just a few. You can upgrade the SE with many of the power options that are standard on the SXT, but you'll have to get the SXT if you want optional ABS or integrated child seats. 

The Dodge Caravan SXT is a superbly built and designed minivan offering good power and a smooth comfy ride. 

From the outside, this van is positively gorgeous compared to other "rectangles" on wheels currently available. It&#146s a beautiful combination of classic lines and curves. I definitely give Dodge two thumbs up on their aesthetically pleasing exterior. 

Acceleration is sprightly with the standard 3.3L V6, although, keep in mind, it's not designed to be a dragster. It has enough pull to instill confidence in just about any situation. The transmission shifts nicely changing gears with near imperceptible smoothness. Handling has definitely impressed me as being sporty yet supple in all road conditions. Cornering is amazingly car-like and stable, letting you take corners and make turns with confidence. This is one responsive van. Inside noise levels are very low allowing for real conversations all the way to the third row without yelling. 

Inside you'll find everything made of high quality material and within easy reach, as though some thought actually went into their design and layout. Again, nice lines and curves create a pleasing visual atmosphere. 

The SXT is very nicely equipped with plenty of nice features such as an optional overhead console with storage; light; compass; outside temp; built-in garage door openers; and trip computer with time traveled, miles per gallon, and miles until empty. The standard stereo is a six-speaker am/fm cassette with CD player, which will show you the name of the radio station, song, and artist (if offered in your area) in addition to sounding great. Storage is of course excellent with plenty of it throughout the van. The cup holders are quite good, holding even the largest mega soda drink firmly. With the optional rear split bench seat, you can take out either side (or both) for additional storage and still have seating for five (or four). 

If I had one complaint, it would be the lack of a rear air option. The short model of the Caravan is a mere six inches shorter than the Grand Caravan and Daimler-Chrysler determined that this shorter length is sufficiently small as to not merit rear air conditioning vents or controls. I disagree and would have liked the option at least. On the other hand, the heating and air conditioning system is equipped with dual fans in front and appears to adequately cool or warm the interior as desired. 

Pricing on this van is currently quite competitive with big incentives to get buyers into the showrooms and out the door with a new van. 

All-in-all our family really loves this new van with it's comfortable seating, nice looks, peppy yet smooth engine, and large feature list. I have no reservations in recommending this minivan to anyone in the market for one.
