            In the early 1990s, the Porsche organization saw its financial debts mount as showroom sales continued their downward slide from its peak in 1987. Faced with the prospect of going out of business or becoming another acquisition in a larger automaker's portfolio, Porsche decided instead to remain independently-owned and reorganize its management and manfacturing processes. In doing so, the 928 and 968 models would cease production, and a single platform would be designed to offspring the company's only two production models, the 911 and the Boxster.

The Boxster, the first all-new model from Porsche in some 20 years, was first displayed as a prototype at the 1993 Detroit Auto Show. The chief designer of the Boxster was Grant Larson, an American who graduated from the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California and worked at Audi's design studio before being hired by Porsche. Styling influences recalled Porsche models from the past, including the RSK, RS60, 550 Spyder, and 356. Stefan Stark was responsible for the Boxster's interior design which originally included the use of the Porsche hallmark 5 dial instrumentation in the show car, but was later reduced to 3 overlapping dials for the final production version.

In a mid-engine layout, the rear-drive Boxster retains the company's celebrated flat-six engine type. But the introduction of the Boxster, and later the 996-type 911, marked the end of air-cooled flat-six engines for Porsche. Ever-increasing emissions and noise regulations have finally exceeded the technological capacities of Porsche engineers and the air-cooled flat-six engine, so the switch to water-cooling is no surprise to anyone, but it historically marks the end of an era at Porsche. 

The 1997-1999 Boxster's 24-valve 2.5-liter engine uses an aluminum block and cylinder heads, with integrated dry sump lubrication. The valvetrain is virtually maintenance-free due to automatic hydraulic adjustment, and the chain-driven camshaft has an automatic tensioner. VarioCam, Porsche's variable valve timing system, works together with the Bosch Motronic M 5.2 engine management system (ECU/brain) to reduce hydrocarbons in the emissions and to help produce as much torque as possible from the 201 horsepower engine.

Two transmissions are available with the Boxster: a manual and an automatic. The 5-speed manual transmission was developed in conjunction with Volkswagen and features a tensioned cable shifter. The floor-hinged clutch pedal operates the single-plate dry clutch with hydraulic actuators and uses a 2-piece flywheel. Overall feel of the Boxster's manual shifter is, unfortunately, clunky and vague-feeling (like all other VW manuals). A short-shift aftermarket kit might help the situation, but it'll never be mistaken for a Miata's snick-snick operation. The 5-speed Tiptronic transmission is sourced from ZF, and can be operated as fully-automatic or switched over to the manual shift mode for clutchless shifting. However, the Tiptronic is still based on a conventional automatic transmission with a torque converter, so &quot;manual&quot; shifting is always subject to the transmission's electronic conditions and programs (i.e. it will not upshift or downshift unless conditions allow). Porsche desperately needs to replace the Tiptronic with a more respectable sequential-shifting clutchless manual transmission, like Ferrari's F1 transmission in its 355/360 models, which also offers a fully-automatic mode.

All Boxsters are assembled in two locations: Zuffenhausen, Germany, and Uusikaupunki, Finland. The Zuffenhausen factory is Porsche owned, while the Finland factory is owned by Valmet Automotive where Saab 9-3 Convertibles are also assembled in-line with Boxsters. Since Boxster orders exceeded Porsche's Zuffenhausen fulfillment capacity, Porsche needed to contract with Valmet to handle the additional volume. Porsche production teams duplicated the Zuffenhausen factory operation in the Valmet factory to maintain the same high level of quality throughout all Boxsters, no matter which site they were assembled. Both factories employ manufacturing processes that were heavily influenced by Japanese automotive manufacturers, an initiative spearheaded by Porsche board member Wendelin Wiedeking, and the subject of a business management book by James P. Womack and Daniel T. Jones called &quot;Lean Thinking.&quot;

The Boxster is most likely to be cross-shopped with the BMW M Roadster, Audi TT Roadster, and Mercedes SLK230. BMW's lesser-performing Z3 2.3 and 2.8 models, as well as the Honda S2000, Mazda Miata, and Toyota MR2 Spyder round-out the roadster class rivals but because of the price difference are less likely to be seriously considered. From a statistical perspective, the Boxster S compares most closely with the Chevrolet Corvette Convertible. But as they saying goes, there are Porsche guys, and there are Corvette guys. The culture gap between these two marques is still as wide as Budweiser and Warsteiner, unless you are wealthy enough to overcome culture by owning both!

For the 2000 model year, Porsche has introduced a second Boxster model, the Boxster S, that represents a higher-performance version of the original model. Significant new standard features of the S model include: 3.2-liter 6-cylinder engine producing 250 hp, Motronic ME 7.2 engine management system with E-gas electronic throttle, 6-speed manual transmission, red-painted brake calipers, perforated (cross-drilled) brake discs, 17-inch wheels and tires, dual exhaust tips, soft top with roofliner, carbon filter in the climate control system, center front air intake, driver's and passenger's illuminated vanity mirrors in the sunvisors, silver instrument faces with aluminum dial rings, 3-spoke SRS steering wheel, revised and upgraded interior materials, and an alarm system with interior zone sensor and remote control.

Performance figures for the S model: 0-to-60 mph in 5.2 seconds for the 6-speed manual, and a 161 mph top speed. Fuel mileage is 18 mpg city, 26 mpg highway, with a 16.9 gallon tank. 

Even the standard Boxster model has benefited from the 2000 model year improvements: it now has a new 2.7-liter 6-cylinder engine producing 217 hp, along with the ME 7.2 ECU and E-gas throttle.

Base price for the standard Boxster is $42,195 and the S model is $51,430. No longer the &quot;under $40,000&quot; roadster as it was introduced in 1997 for $39,900, but in reality the typical selection of options pushed most Boxsters to $43,000-$45,000 for the first three model years. The new standard features unique to the S model are relatively bargain priced (it would be more expensive to upgrade the standard Boxster to S model specifications) and its extra horsepower has changed the car's character from satisfying to sensational. Its 9/10ths a 911 in many ways except price. Consider that a 911 Cabriolet costs $80,000, for which you get 50 more horsepower, a rear-mounted engine, a slightly upgraded interior and rear seats, and ... a front end design that looks exactly like the half-priced Boxster! Porsche is attending to the styling issue and soon the 911 and Boxster will wear separately distinctive faces. 

But for some buyers, the less-expensive Boxster S offers all of the 911's hallmark performance, handling, and sensory attributes, which then makes the 911 seem overpriced. Except for two important facts: Porsche has stated that it will never race the Boxster model, and there will never be a factory-built Boxster Turbo. Both of these policies are aimed at protecting the 911's heritage as the premier Porsche model. So, if you're looking to professionally race a Porsche against BMW M3s and Ferrari 355s, or if you are a devout follower of Porsche Turbos, the 911 is your only choice.

A side note for Turbo fans: Gemballa, a respected tuner of Porsches based in Germany, offers a 310 hp turbo kit for the 2.5-liter Boxster that boosts acceleration to match that of the new S model but with a 175 mph claimed top speed. The Dm30,000 cost, however, makes the new S model much more of a bargain.

One of the great aspects of ordering a new Porsche in recent years has been the exhaustive option list available from the factory. The Boxster S is no different, with an option list that is 9 pages long, not including 7 additional pages outlining standard equipment and color options. Some might feel these options are a complete waste of money, but I admire Porsche's level of customization which can custom-tailor any of its cars to each owner's personal tastes. And unlike aftermarket products, Porsche's extensive factory options boost longterm resale value because of their authenticity. Some options can even become highly sought after in the collector car marketplace.

Whether you choose the regular Boxster or the S model, both offer four seasons driving via the optional traction control, heated seats, and hardtop. For some roadster buyers, these options add unnecessary weight to the car which, in their minds, can detract from the car's maximum performance potential. But I offer these arguments: Porsche, every bit aware of performance, would never offer options or accessories that would severly limit the car's performance in a way that would risk the car's characteristics and credibility as being a true Porsche. Secondly, even if more than half of all Boxster owners designate their Boxsters as a second car for weekend drives and track competition, the other significant collection of owners who rely on their Boxster as their only car for daily transportation require four seasons driveability through rain, snow and, uh, sleet. Porsche smartly took this into consideration, not only with the Boxster, but with the 911 as well. In fact, the Porsche hallmark has always been to design sports cars that excel both on the track and on public roads in all types of weather. I can't say the same for the Miata or S2000 or even the M Roadster (all of which do not offer traction control or some form of 4WD as an available option).

In conclusion, if I had to choose only one roadster to own today, it would be the Porsche Boxster S. The standard Boxster would be a fine choice, too, and as the S model begins to penetrate the marketplace, 1997-1999 Boxster resale values should finally begin to dip below the $30,000 mark, opening up Boxster ownership to an anxiously awaiting enthusiast crowd that previously could only afford Miatas or used Z3s. It may not offer the stellar maintenance record of a Miata or S2000 (assuming the S2000 follows the tradition of previous Honda sports cars, such as the NSX and Prelude), but none of the Boxster's weaknesses will likely keep you from reaching your destination, nor end up costing thousands of dollars to repair. When you think about the high amount of maintenance required by competition-spec race cars, including Porsche's own 911 GT1, the Boxster looks like a Honda Accord by comparison. And the Miata and S2000 will then look like kitchen appliances. This is not to suggest that performance and reliability are inversely proportionate, but its my opinion that a perfect sports car cannot be built. To do so would be to create a car that is no more desirable than a Krups toaster. Even the ultra-conservative &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; recommended the Boxster in August 1998 saying it is &quot;the closest thing to a perfect sports car&quot; while the Miata was praised with the familiar-but-secondbest &quot;simple and fun&quot; motto. The Miata and S2000 are great achievers, but they do not invoke passion like that of Porsches and Ferraris. I put a price on that kind of desire, and for the cost of two Miatas and an occassional unscheduled maintenance repair, I would happily own a Boxster S and never look back.<br><br>
