            I was looking for something better in a car than the 1996 Buick Skylark I was driving.  Although it was loaded, it did nothing for me.  I bought the Alero back at the beginning of June, and I know that hasn't been long, but being a mechanics daughter and owning 4 brand new cars, I know this is a good one.  I bought the GL3 4 door sedan, with the v-6 (could never go back to a 4).  I absolutely love this car.  It handles so well city and freeway driving.  Very quick off the line and comfortable.  The all wheel traction control is very nice as well.  We just got hit with a huge storm and I had no problems driving through the standing water with this car.  I think the seats are comfortable as well, and I like the placement of everything.  The cruise control on the steering wheel is nice, but having to get used to the windshield wiper controls on the right of the steering column is interesting.  I had my father check out the car (after I bought it, I just had to have it after driving it), he said the placement of everything in the engine was a nice set-up, with everything relatively easy to get to.  That helps, since he'll be working on it!  The trunk is huge and the split rear seats are a great accessory.  The stereo has excellent sound quality.  All in all, I think this car is definitely a keeper, which is exactly what I was looking for!  <br><br>
