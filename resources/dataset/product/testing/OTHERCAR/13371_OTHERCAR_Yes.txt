            I owned a 1993 Chevrolet Cavalier for 7 years, buying it new in October of 1992. Buying this car was not in my plans, but you know how it is when you get &quot;car fever&quot;. I was in the mood to look, and had pretty much decided on a Geo Prism,when I saw this pretty bright aqua Cavalier sitting behind the dealership. It still had the transport stickers on it, and had not even been cleaned up after coming right off the truck. I had to beg the people at the dealership to even let me get inside of it.

Well, I was sold, from the moment I got inside. It was very comfortable, and just the perfect size for me. To my amazement, it had a CD player with an exceptional speaker system with equalizer. 

I had just spent seven years with a Honda CRXsi, which was just a remarkable car. I loved the small sports car feel of that two-seater. It was solid black, inside and out, quite a beauty. But now, I was ready for something a little larger. The cavalier seemed to be the perfect choice.

I took it for a spin around the block, and on the highway. The mileage was 3 miles when I took off! The ride was smooth and I was even more impressed with the handling.

This Cavalier was a V-6 engine, so it was really peppy, and in all the time I owned it, I never felt like it bogged down when I needed a little speed to pass.

In the seven years I owned this car,I really spent very little on service. I kept it maintained regularly, using the same mechanic each time. I had to have the ignition and starter replaced once, a water pump replaced, some hoses, an exhaust pipe, a new battery twice, and a water leak in the front area beneath the windshield, but other than those it was relatively trouble free. In seven years I don't consider those bad repairs. 

In the last year I noticed rust underneath the doors on both sides, not on the doors themselves, but on the frame below the door. The rest of the paint on the car was still as bright and shiny as the day I bought it. I kept it waxed regularly, and it was never garaged. 

One thing I noticed which is only funny, is when it had rained, and I had to get something out of the trunk, I always would get drips of water on my head! You would think I would have learned after awhile. It had something to do with the way the trunk lid went nearly straight up above your head instead of at an angle.

My car came with high performance quality tires, better than what was put on regular Cavaliers. It was a package that was a step above the rest. When I bought new tires a few years later, I had to buy some to fit the rims, so I did have to pay a little more then.

There were 68,000 miles on the car after seven years,which is a little less than the average yearly expected mileage. Most of those miles were around town, with very few long road trips.

Why did I get rid of this car? Well,I don't consider it getting rid of it, I was letting someone else have the pleasure of driving it for awhile. No, the truth is, I wasn't planning on buying a car THIS time either. I just went browsing (should have known better), and found a 1998 Buick Regal, just traded in, with 6,000 miles. The best part was it belonged to a family member's neighbor,who only traded it in because she wanted black with heated leather seats, instead of white with cloth seats! So here I was buying a car again, because I couldn't resist.

I only hope I get as many years and as dependable service from this new (used) car as I got from my 1993 Cavalier. <br><br>
