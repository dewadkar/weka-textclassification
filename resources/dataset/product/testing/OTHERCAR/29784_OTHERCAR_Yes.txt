            We purchased a used 1991 Mercury Tracer wagon as our first family vehicle.  So far we have been very happy with it!  It is very roomy and we haven't had any problems with it yet.

We have AT, with power locks and windows.  The two carseats we use fit great it the back seat.  The trunk area is spacious enough to fit our stroller with groceries too!  When we visit the drive in we can even lay the back seat down to make a bed area to lay in. 

The only problem we've come across, although it can be good at times, is that the odometer doesn't go over 85mph!  That prevents us from ever speeding and we know it would be a good car when we hand it down to our kids!

The top racks are great for when we have to transport things, even a Christmas tree.

I love the look of the car too, very contemporary, doesn't even feel like we're in an actual &quot;station wagon&quot;.  

I would recommend this car to any young family who needed a more spacious vehicle.  <br><br>
