            We actually only got our 99 Corolla CE because the dealer gave us a good trade-off with our leased Tacoma (on which we were WAY over on miles).  

It's a pretty nice car.  Has some get-up-and-go.  It is also very affordable.  We were able to get a nice number of features on our car without emptying our wallet.  They way this car performs is pretty good, it is simply the physical aspects of the car that I don't particularly care for. 

For one thing, it is very small.  Also, when I found the exterior I liked, I found out it only came with beige interior, which has proven to be a very bad choice with two young children.  The car is only about 9 months old and already has a nice collection of stains.  

Another thing I don't care for is the fact that the bumper does not extend to the wheelwell, as it does on some of the cars I have had in the past.  One month after I got this car, I was rear-ended on the freeway.  The bumper bounced right back, but I got a nice dent between the bumper and the wheelwell.

Overall, all I can say is that I have had better cars.  I guess I would not necessarily recommend this to my friends.<br><br>
