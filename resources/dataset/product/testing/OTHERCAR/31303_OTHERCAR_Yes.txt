            The Volvo Cross Country station wagon is a quality car that provides
room enough for an entire family's needs.  Complete with a quality 
engine, furnishings, and enough room for five persons, the Volvo
station wagon also has room to carry  ang else you want to.  It gets
great mileage (about 24 miles to the gallon) and comes with great
accesories, such as heated seats, cargo nets, and a roof rack.  It is
a perfect automobile for a family because of the extra cargo space
which is great for road trips and camping trips.  It is also extremely
safe, with side impact protection and dual airbags.  It provides a
 great mix of safety, comfort, and cargo space, while still having a 
powerful engine.<br><br>
