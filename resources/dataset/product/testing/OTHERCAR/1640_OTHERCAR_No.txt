            I bought my standard transmission, five speed overdrive, used three years ago.  It is a 1992 model. It has 90,000 miles on it and has had no major problems and sounds as smooth as new. The alternator just died but perhaps that is not too unusual for this age of the car. It gets great gas mileage and with the cost of gas up so much, that saves. I bought it since these Toyota engines have the reputation of lasting up to 300,000 miles which I am hoping to get. I primarily use it for basic commuting though take some several hundred mile trips once or twice a year. The only annoying minor stuff that has broken are both inside front door handles which one can buy at a dealer and install oneself in minutes, the door and trunk locks often take several key turns to get the car open and the windshield washing mechanism's motor seems to run but I can get any water to spray out onto the windshield. The air conditioning works fine and heat is great. I wish the trunk was deeper and or larger to fit a bicycle in and still be able to close the trunk completely. I would purchase a Prizm again. My wife has an automatic 1990 model, also quite dependable. <br><br>
