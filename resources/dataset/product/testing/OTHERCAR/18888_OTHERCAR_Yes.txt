            I bought my 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo about a year and a half ago.  I was looking for a vehicle that looked nice, got around, and had plenty of room.  Well, with this jeep I found all of that!  

I have a strong opinion on never buying new cars.  You can save so much money otherwise!  My jeep looks brand new, and I ended up saving around 20,000 buying it used.  

As for getting around, the jeep is extremely nice.  It is very sleek and, like some sport utility vehicles, does not at all seem bulky or too big.  Steering is excellent, and it handles turns with grace.  Hauling friends, packages, and pets around has definitely gotten a lot easier.  I have found their is plenty of leg room, and room for up to five people, with plenty of space.  

The back end is GREAT for packages, safety equipment, pets, or whatever you desire.  And an added plus - you don't have to get out of the car to put stuff inside!  

This jeep has two cup holders in the front, as well as a little storage compartment, perfect for kleenex, napkins, maps, whatever.  The seats also recline to very comfortable positions.  There are also little ash trays, so nicely designed I only noticed they were there a couple weeks ago, on each side.

The only con I can even think of on this vehicle is the lack of cup holders in the back.  This would be nice when eating on the run, etc.  

However, overall, I know I will definitely always have a jeep as one of my vehicles!  They are great for any family, even for single people.  And you're sure to feel cool driving one!
