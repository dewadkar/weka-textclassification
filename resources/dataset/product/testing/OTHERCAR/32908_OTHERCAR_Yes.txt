            I am the original owner of a 91 Rodeo, 4x4, standard shift, now with 185000 miles!
It has not been religiously maintained, anything but, and so far, I have had virtually no problems with it. Still get 22 miles to a gallon which beats most SUVs. 
This vehicle is a work horse, has brought me safely home through the deepest snow on mountain roads, and still drives like a dream. 
I tested others before purchasing the Rodeo, none have the same roomy interior, except, of course, for the Honda Passport which is basically the same vehicle, only more expensive with a lesser warranty.
The exterior is still flawless, no rust anywhere! The interior is in excellent condition as well. Many of my colleagues bought Ford Explorers or Jeep Cherokees that same year, and most are on their third trade-in for various reasons.
When the time comes to trade, believe me, it will again be a Rodeo! It's the sleeper in the industry.
