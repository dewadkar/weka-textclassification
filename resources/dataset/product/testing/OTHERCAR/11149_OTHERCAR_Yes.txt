             To tell the whole story, I have to begin this way...

 We had leased a 2001 Lincoln LS, and the only thing I liked about the Lincoln, were the "ooh's" and "ahh's" from  people impressed by the overpriced car. We were given a deal from our dealership to turn our lease in, and buy or lease another vehicle. So, we purchased the 2003 Sable. The only conditions I made to my husband was....it HAD to have leather seats, it had to be the greenish-gray color, and it had to have the bells and whistles.
 
 So...he bought the Platinum Edition. I HAVE to brag about this car! It gets good gas mileage, it's a smooth ride (smoother than the Lincoln in my opinion), we haven't had a problem from it (we had taken our Lincoln in a number of times because the motor in the windows kept busting), and a few other petty problems. It's also got GREAT "get up and go" power. 

 The only thing I found that is a bit "off" is the blind spot...it really is a "blind spot". But once you get used to the car, it doesn't pose a problem. 

 The front end also seems longer than it really is. (It may just be me though).   It may not look as good on the outside as the LS, but it's still a handsome car, with lots more spunk than the LS. The trunk is also very spacious. The seats fold down, so that is a plus as well.
 

 You get more for your money with this car. We have also had a Taurus (a 2000) and I LOVED that car, but I am far more impressed with the Sable. I now have a car that I am FINALLY attached to, and plan to have this one around for awhile.  (Unless we get my dream vehicle...the Lexus RX300. 

 I hope this helps.
