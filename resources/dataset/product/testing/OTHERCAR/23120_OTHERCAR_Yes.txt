            I bought this car in the summer of 99. I actually bought it because my previous car (a Chevy Corsica) had a transmission problem while on a roadtrip and I didn't have time to get it repaired.                       It was the car of choice for me, because I got to drive the 98 model as a rental while at a school for 4 months. I fell in love with the ride quality and the roominess.
   The roominess was probably the nicest thing about it, because I have 2 children and when we take a road trip we really take a road trip. Specifically, I bought the car and within 3 days my family and I drove 3000 miles so I could go back to work (we were on vacation when we bought the car). No one had any complaints and we all noticed the increased comfort and ride smoothness. Now that's a test of a used car and it passed with flying colors.
   There is a recall on the 98 model for the right rear brakeline so make sure that's taken care of before you drive off. The problem is that some of the brakelines are getting worn through by an improperly placed exhaust clamp but the dealers will take care of it for you once the recall notice is in your hand.
   The head gasket is another problem I've read about. Evidently, the 98 and earlier models have a problem with head gasket going bad at or after 55,000 miles. Like I said I've just read about this information and it was actually here on EPINIONS that I read it. So be aware of the possibility when you are making the deal and use it to drive the price down. 
    Overall I highly recommend this car but I want people to be aware of the problems likely with it. I am at 43,000 miles myself and have only had oil changes and the brakeline recall. So HAPPY DRIVING and be safe out there. <br><br>
