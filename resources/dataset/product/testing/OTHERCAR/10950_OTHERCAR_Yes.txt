            Well, it's my first BMW so I am a little star struck but it's not my first performance car. I find the quality outstanding and details finished to a fine point. Being a person who appreciates beauty and good looks the color that struck me was the Titanium Silver. I found that this color brought the lines and curves out on this model quite well. The darker colors are fine also. The performance is good with the 194hp 6. Personally, I would like to have a few more horsepower to make up for that slight lag when stepping out of tight spots at speeds around 60 to 70. The handling is BMW, outstanding to put it in a nut shell. The person who would like a car like this would need to like finer automobiles. I personally like to keep a clean car although the &quot;BEEMER&quot; is not my primary vehicle. It makes a nice 'getaway' car, meaning, a pretty girl OR if you prefer (handsome guy) and a weekend destination that is not clearly defined, with reservations along the way, or in a wonderful place, anyway I hope you get my point.<br><br>
