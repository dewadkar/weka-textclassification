            This car can be described with one word only:  POWERFUL.  But because of the 100 word limit, I will go on to describe most of the features and things I love about this car. :)

It's V8 NorthStar engine makes this car one of the most powerful cars on the road.  Barely tapping the gas peddle makes the car accelerate unlike any other car I have driven.  The Boss AM/FM/CD/CASS/12DISCCD CHANGER sounds great, very crisp and very clear music from stations even very far away.  Seat warmers make the car very comfortable to drive in the winter time.  The Digital display says almost anything that could possibly be wrong with your vehicle; from leaving your turn signal on, to changing your engine oil.  Some more features include automatic headlights, automatic windshield wipers, temperature control for driver, passenger, and back seat; seperatly control their own air flow.

This car is very pricey, but it is a very powerful and will catch the attention of others going down the road.  I would suggest giving this car a test drive if you are looking for a luxury car in the higher price range.<br><br>
