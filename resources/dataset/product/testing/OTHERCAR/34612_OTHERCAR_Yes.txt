            In August of 1999 I was involved in a very bad collision in my 3 month old Subaru Legacy Sedan. As I was taking a left turn a car came speeding around a corner and slammed into my car at the right rear tire. I was sent into the spin of my life (I don't even know how many times, but a witness said four times around). When I finally stopped spinning I began to catch my bearings and realized that I wasn't hurt at all. I immediately jumped out of the car because I had been hit directly in the gas tank and I was afraid of a fire. I went around my car to inspect the damage and found that the gas tank and the bumper was still there, but the rest of the underside of my car from the rear passenger seats and back was gone! It was scattered down the road up to 180 feet away. The car had also been bent into an angle resembling the shape of a boomerang. The rear end had been knocked about four inches to the left and had caused the moonroof to pop right out of the roof of the car. Seeing the damage, the paramedics that arrived kept asking me if I was sure I was alright. I'd been shaken and stirred, but I was fine. 

The guy in the other car, a Ford Escort, suffered head and facial injuries and his car was completely destroyed. I felt pretty darn good about surviving the accident so well until I arrived at the car rental place and they tried to get me to rent a......Ford Escort!!! (&quot;NO WAY! Give me the Buick over there instead.&quot;)

I had my car towed to a collision center where they replaced the entire rear end including the shield panel behind the rear passenger seats and the gas tank (the gas tank had been bashed in but never ruptured). After seven weeks and $10,000 of my insurance company's money, my beautiful 1999 Subaru Legacy is back in business, happily parked out front as I write. It runs just as great as the day I bought it and I love it so much I plan to keep it at least 10 years (God willing, and barring any more Ford Escorts from hell).

Go and test drive one. I guarantee you'll fall in love with Subaru.<br><br>
