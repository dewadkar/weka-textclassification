            The BMW 323ci is a remarkable vehicle. As a BMW owner for many years, I've been very pleasantly surprised at the power the 323 delivers with the new 2.5 engine. The addition of DSC (Dynamic Stability Control) in addition to the previous traction control system (AST) is a great improvement, offering lateral control in addition to just front and back traction control.
It's not a car for everyone. If you're looking for a quiet, more refined ride, the Audi may be the choice. If you want front wheel drive, Volvo has a great car. But, if it's performance, fun, safety (more than any other in the class, including Volvo), then the Bmw is the only choice. The active safety offered by the balance of the car and the DSC system exceeds the safety of all others in the price range. In more than one case, the BMW has given me the opportunity to get out of trouble before I really got into it. I might mention that this trouble was caused by people talking on phones in other cars, eating, playing stoplight dragster and lane changing with no notice as opposed to me trying to be a formula one driver on a curvy road. The BMW gave me the opportunity to get out of the situation before it got bad.
I love everything about the car, except that my insurance company thinks it's a high risk vehicle. <br><br>
