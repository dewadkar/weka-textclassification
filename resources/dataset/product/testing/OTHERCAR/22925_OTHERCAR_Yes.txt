            I recently just purchased a 95 Jeep Wrangler, Green with a hard top, alloy wheels, and chrome package. All I can say is....Sweet! This little baby rambles.
  I bought it because ill be in the snow and the &quot;on the fly&quot; four wheel drive makes getting out of bad situations a sinch. The 5 speed manual is as smooth as butter and the brakes react great. I feel like im driving a little tank, and that makes me feel safe. 
  The other great thing about the Wrangler is it's little possibilities. Often people look into a 4x4 with expectations of great off roading, but often your local city obstical course can be a challange enough. Many a times has my little baby got me out of a crowded parking lot by going up and over curbs and islands and into the open street.
  Style is also another big factor. The Jeep Wrangler is such a versatille little car that it can accomidate anyones looks. From rough red neck with lifts and nobby tires, to teen machine with a bikini top and nice rims,this little thing styles.
  Now style isn't everything, comfort is also essential. Although it dosn't have corvette racing seats, it still rides pretty comfy. With more of a sitting up chair, you feel like a comander of the road. The ride is a little bumpy, but lets face it, if ya wanted smooth you would buy a caddy. The back seat is a little small, but hey I don't have to ride in it so who cares. Another great feature on this car is the heater, it gets warm, and quick.
  It's a little noisy because of the removable top, but then again it's great fun in the sun. It turns great and is small enough to fit in almost any parking spot. I love my little tank.<br><br>
