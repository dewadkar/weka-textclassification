            I bought my 2002 Honda Civic EX Sedan Automatic on December 8, 2001.  For a bit of background, I'll be 40 in about a month and I've been through a LOT of vehicles.  I can honestly say that I'm happier with this vehicle after 3 months than with any other vehicle I've ever owned; and I've owned vehicles that are much more expensive than this Civic.

The only reason I went with the EX was because I wanted the V-TEC engine.  I didn't think I'd ever use the moon roof but I find myself using it quite often.

The options I got on the car were the splash guards and a rear wing spoiler.  I felt the car was a bit bland and the rear wing spoiler made a big difference in the overall appearance of the car.

The car is surprisingly quiet.  I'm not very tall (5'9")but I have plenty of leg, head, elbow and shoulder room.  All of the controls are agreeably placed and function as you'd expect.  The engine and transmission are very smooth and make for a comfortable drive wherever you go.  I've driven this car in Atlanta traffic and on a long trip and it's been very comfortable in both extremes.

Sometimes I'd like the car to have a bit more pep but then I remember that I'm averaging 34.5 MPG in town and 37 MPG on the road.  I can live with a bit less pep and keep those averages.

I did a ton of homework before buying.  I test-drove all of the other usual suspects.  Rather than explaining why I didn't buy the others I'll tell you what pushed me toward the Civic.  

The overall feel of the Civic just screams quality.  The way the doors shut, the way the body parts fit together, the interior cloth is far superior to the competition, even the plastics felt superior to me.  

The dealership I bought from also gets very high marks.  If you're in the Atlanta area, give Team Honda on Thornton Road a visit.  You won't be disappointed.
