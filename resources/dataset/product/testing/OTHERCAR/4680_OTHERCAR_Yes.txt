            NOTE:  THIS REVIEW APPLIES TO THE 2001 model, since it is virtually identical to the 2000.  Unforunately, Epinions has structured the site so people looking for information on new vehicles are guided to reviews written by people who haven't owned them very long!  I feel that my review of the 2000 Tundra applies to the 2001, so I am adopting it for use here.

Minor changes for 2001 are optional color keyed bumpers and tailgate handle on Limited models, optional notepad holders, and 2 new colors replacing two dropped ones.   

I bought a '2000 Tundra SR5 access cab 2wd last fall. So far, I love the vehicle. I bought it because I wanted a reliable truck that I could buy and keep for years, rather than selling when the warranty was up. I also wanted a four door extended cab truck to replace my regular cab full size Ford. 

I hadn't seriously considered the Tundra UNTIL I took a test-drive on a whim. I was instantly impressed by the superior level of refinement and quietness, even though I wasn't sold on the styling. The Tundra really does drive almost like a Camry, at least compared to its competition. I THOUGHT my '98 F-150 was quiet and handled well. After driving the Tundra it sounded loud and coarse in comparison. 

The Tundra is very quick and powerful. The engine is smooth and refined, and the truck seems even faster because the engine provides the power with so little noise and vibration. Actually, it IS fast (for a truck).  0-60mph in 7.8 sec in 2wd access cab form.  Body lean is a little much in turns, and it will occasionally bottom out on bumps, but that is the price you pay for the super smooth ride and ability to absorb road imperfections.  But compared to most other trucks I've driven, it actually has very stable, controlable handling.  I also like the light touch on the brakes and steering wheel.  This can be a negative in some vehicles, but I don't feel the Tundra loses much in terms of road feel due to this.  The easily applied brakes make the Tundra feel safer to me.  They're not grabby, either, just easy to apply.  "Carlike", you might say.

For anyone who uses the vehicle for commuting and ocasional hauling, the Tundra is the best of the lot, UNLESS you need to haul adult passengers in the back seats. It is tight compared to the domestic makes, though suitable for short trips. The looks problem I had with the Tundra were eliminated by the 265/70-16 tires and wheels added by the distributor, as well as omitting the wheel flares seen on many models, which are oversized for this vehicle, and throw off the proportions of the vehicle.

I LOVE: the quiet ride, fantastic braking ability for a truck, competent handling, abundance of well designed cupholders, two level console, great resale value, Toyota quality (no defects in 8,000 miles) , powerful acceleration.

I HATE: very little, actually. The parking brake pedal intrudes on leg room somewhat, the paint is surprisingly easy to chip for a Toyota product, the driver's seat could use another 1" of travel, and some sort of duct work intrudes on front passenger leg room fairly severely. The pop out cupholder works fine, but is flimsy and the passenger's leg could easily break it. 

If you are looking for a car-like ride, but need a truck, you would like the Tundra. If you like a truck with a lot of pickup that can also haul and tow, it is also an excellent choice. It is NOT the truck for you if you believe that "size matters " . It is also not the best choice for really heavy duty work. When Toyota comes out with a 3/4 ton version, then it can compete in that area. I use it to tow a 3,500 lb trailer, and it does just fine.  Actually, it surprises in this area.  I pull away from stop lights with trailer in tow, and sometimes forget I'm even towing at all.  Overall, only the Chevy Silverado even compares in daily use comfort and refinement.  I also have a 2001 Tahoe, so I'm fond of the Chevy/GM trucks too, but I have to say that I find the Tundra easier to handle.  The slightly more compact size comes in handy except in extreme-use situations or when carrying passengers, which I don't.

UPDATE: After one year of use, it's still running and performing almost flawlessly, but I do have a few minor "flaws" to mention.

- Door indents are too weak, and the door doesn't want to stay open on inclines when you're rooting around in the back for tools. Potentially painful.

- The fuel filler door has a lock operated by your ignition key, but no remote opener! This means you have to pull your keys out of the ignition and walk back there to get to your gas cap.
