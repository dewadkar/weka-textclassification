            I originally wrote a great review for this car. However, the transmission problems have grown worse in recent months and trips to the service department have uncovered that the transmission problems are a "known" problems and there may be a "fix" by mid-year.  However, researching further - see Edmund's Townhall discussion on the Lexus ES300 - uncovers many owners with this problem that date back several years - and still not addressed by Lexus. 

Unfortunately, these problems do not show-up during a test drive but begin to appear after a few hundred to a few thousand miles. My issue now is one of ethics. Since this is a "known" problem, you would hope that the sales people would let you know before spending a good deal of money.

My advice to any one thinking of buying an ES3000 or Lexus in general, is to steer clear until there is a clear fix for this problem and Lexus repairs it's credibility with it's existing owners.
