            This is the car that started it all for me. I bought my 92 Geo metro 2dr 5 speed about 3yrs ago and I love this car to this day. It always starts for me in the morning and that is important living in Canada where you can get -37 Celsius some nights in the winter.

When I bought my car it had 123,000 Km on it, just barely broken in as far as I was concerned. There were metros in the paper with 280,000 Km on it and the owners I called usually said the car outgrew their family and they needed something bigger but the car ran great they said, come see it for yourself.

I finally settled on the one I have now because the mileage was right, (for me anyway) there was no rust, and it was clean. I paid 2200.00 CDN for it and never regretted it since.

There were a few things I had to do with this car when I bought it as you do with all used cars and they were as follows, (I could not believe how cheap everything was to fix)

New struts, about 60.00 CDN each
New strut mounts (rubber things on top of the strut that attach it to the car) 54.00 each CDN
New tie rod ends, about 55.00 per side CDN
New control arms, about 108.00 per side CDN
And 150.00 labor to the mechanic to do this all.

The reason I replaced these parts was because when I bought the car there was a knocking noise in the front driver end when I went over a bump. My car has to be QUIET when I drive it cause that's the way I like it. Even the mechanic told me I was wasting my money on half the stuff that I was replacing but I didn't care. It made me feel better about my car and considering the car never cost me much to begin with I thought no big deal. Anyway, the knocking noise did disappear after the parts were replaced.  :)

The oil was changed by me in my garage faithfully every 3000 Km and still does not burn a drop of oil at 228,000 Km.

Since then over the past 3yrs I have done my brakes on this car and boy was that ever a treat. 18.00 CDN each for BRAND NEW rotors on this car. I told the guy at the parts store that he misunderstood me, I wanted a price on NEW rotors, not how much it cost to turn the old ones. We had a good laugh over that.  :)

I had a oil leak that was at the end of the cam shaft behind the timing belt cover, that cost a whole 90.00 CDN to fix including labor to the mechanic.

Replaced the timing belt after a yr. (preventative repair)

Replaced the exhaust, 50.00 CDN for the muffler, and 75.00 for the exhaust pipe from the converter to the muffler.

Hmmm, now I'm stretching the old brain trying to remember what was done on this car, not much left now except for tune-ups, tires, etc. Speaking of tires............. are tires ever cheap on this car. It cost's 15.00 CDN to get a flat tire repaired and for 25.00 I can get a brand new tire installed at Walmart here in Canada. It does not get any better than this I tell ya. Not to mention the gas mileage. I save about 100.00 per month in gasoline costs from what I used to spend.

The only thing it really needs right now is a new battery, it drains real fast when I accidentally leave the lights on and run into a stop for only 5 minutes. But what do you expect? It looks like the original AC Delco battery. Good thing it was a standard, it was so easy to push, jump in and bump start it. Only one time did I have to do that. 10 minutes later the car started from my next stop off the battery.

This car is so good and cheap I told myself if I ever had a chance to purchase another one, what the hell, grab it. This one won't last forever (I think) so I bought a 98 metro that I love too. My wife drives that one for now while the van we own sits in the garage. That saves us another few bucks in gas every month now too.

In closing, I met a courier one day at work who was driving a 1987 chevy sprint car for work. This guy was so cheap, he actually had this thing converted to propane. He had just under 500,000 Km on it and his secret was when the engine died on him he would go to a pick your part auto wrecker, pay 79.00 CDN for a motor, pay a mechanic 300.00 CDN to replace it and off he would go, he was on his 3rd motor at 450,000 PLUS thousand kms. WOW!!!!!!


What a great car!!!!!!!!
