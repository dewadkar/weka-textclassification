            We purchased our Dodge in 1993, brand new.  We�ve since traded it in, however, it�s a truck that I will never forget owning.  It was and is my all time favorite.  Our �baby� was a two tone red and white, Cummins diesel, dually, fully loaded, 4X4, one ton, extended cab.  To say the least she was a monster, and everything about this truck screams out power.

The truck was purchased as a work vehicle, hauling equipment used in our business.  We are in the industrial high-pressure washing and steam cleaning business.  The bed of the truck was more than accommodating for our needs, able to haul whatever we would need to complete a job.  The Cummins diesel engine was extremely powerful, able to tow whatever we could hook up to the back of the truck.    The inside of the truck was comfortable, except if you had to sit in the back of the cab.  I feel that area was rather cramped, and was only suitable for children, or small adults.

Since this truck was so wide and long, you really needed to set up your right turns.   There were numerous times I found I had to back-up so I didn�t hit something. *laughs*  I also had a hard time parking the truck in a parking-lot.  I was always afraid of hitting a car beside me with the dual wheels, or fearing that the bed was sticking too far out.  That was always solved easily by parking at the end of a row, and taking up as many spots as I wanted, because no one really parks down that far.  Hey, the extra walking distance was great exercise!

We had to replace the brakes on the truck numerous times.  I think the reason for this was because we would tow our boat (24 ft cabin cruiser) quite a distance to a lake.  We would have to go down a rather large hill, and even using a lower gear and the trailer having a brake system, the brakes on the truck would still start to get really hot.  The last time we needed to replace the brakes was due to a seal leak.  It seems that Warrior had the same problem after I�d read his post on this subject.  The fluids leaked all over the rear breaks, causing us to have the whole rear brake system replaced.   This was to be all warranty work, which we ended up in court over because the dealership did not want to pay.  Needless to say, we received the money for the brake job that we paid, court costs, and a reimbursement of the balance from the extended warranty we purchased.

I really miss this truck.  We now own a 1998 Chevy � ton, she has her advantages, but nothing can replace the Dodge Diesel Dually we owned.
