            The all-new MR2 Spyder has a history that dates back to 1985.  The original MR2 was supposed to be "a Ferrari-like sports car, but without a Ferrari-like price."  Redesigned for 1991, the MR2 continued as a mid-engine sports car, but was dropped in 1995 due to low sales.  When the 3rd generation MR2 first arrived in 2000, it remained a (M)id-engine, (R)ear-wheel drive, (2)-seat sports car, but this time as a roadster.  Changes for 2002 include an all-new sequential manual transmission (SMT).

<b>EXTERIOR</b>: The MR2 has always been a stylish sports car from its inception.  This body style, however, does not have that striking Ferrari-like look that the previous generation (1991-95) had.  The angular headlamp covers with the round headlights look strange on this car, in my opinion.  Maybe this is because I am so used to seeing MR2's with the flush (pop-up) headlights.  Otherwise, the side scoops and 5-spoke, 15-inch alloy wheels look nice.

<b>INTERIOR</b>: Due to the fact that the engine is right behind you, it can be quite loud on the highway unless your coasting.  Otherwise, the small 4-cylinder engine is quite refined.  With the top up or down, wind noise above 50 mph is noticeable-- at about 70 mph it becomes annoying.  Any faster than that, due to the very short gears, engine noise takes over.  The MR2 is ergonomically correct with big, well-placed controls that are easy to understand.  The MR2 is very low-- 48.2 inches to be exact.  This translates to a minimum amount of headroom for people tall folks, like myself.  To save weight, Toyota skimped on seat padding, which after a while, can make the seats rather uncomfortable.  The pedals are very close together which is a good thing if you want to race, but a hassle for everyday driving.  Once, I accidentally stabbed at the BRAKE pedal when I really wanted to hit the "GO" pedal!

What puzzles me the most about the MR2 is its sorry excuse for a "trunk".  The diminutive 1.9 cubic feet of cargo space is insufficient for everyday use.  Most of the "trunk" consists of a bin that resides behind the seats.  You forget about using the front as storage space because the spare tire sits there (unless you remove it).

<b>ENGINE</b>: The MR2 is powered by a 1.8-liter DOHC inline 4-cylinder engine.  This is the same engine that can be found in other Toyota products including the Corolla, Matrix, and Celica.  In the MR2, it puts out only 138 horsepower at 6,400 rpm, and 125 lb./ft. of torque at 4,400 rpm.  Although the numbers look small, there is only 2,195 pounds worth of MR2 to carry around.  That means that each individual horsepower has to push only 15.9 pounds-- very impressive.  Around town, the MR2 has an adequate amount of of low-end torque to get out of its own way.  As speeds pick up, though, so does the fun factor.  The short-throw 5-speed manual transmission and VERY light clutch make shifting entertaining.  I would like to see Toyota put a 6th gear in MR2 mainly because it revs rather high in top gear when cruising at 70 mph.  I was not able to test their new SMT (Sequential Manual Transmission).  I averaged 27.4 mpg on the recommended regular fuel.

<b>HANDLING</b>: The MR2 is VERY fun to drive.  Just point it in the direction you want to go, and mash the throttle-- that is all there is to it.  The steering ratio is quick, and makes for an extremely enjoyable drive on twisty roads.  Despite the fact that there are 15-inch wheels front and back, it still handles as if it were on rails.  With most of the weight leaning more towards the rear (as with all mid-engine cars), oversteer can be a problem if you get too wound up, ESPECIALLY on slippery surfaces.  There is very little body lean in the corners and almost no nosedive when braking hard.

<b>RIDE</b>: A stiff suspension combined short 96.5-inch long wheelbase conspire to make the MR2's ride choppy, but not as uncomfortable as you might think.  Due to the lightweight, some sharp bumps can register harshly throughout the cabin-- enough to the point where you might want to check the rims for any damage.

<b>RELIABILITY</b>: All Toyota products are very reliable in general.  So far, no recalls have been issued.  During my test drive, there were no problems at all.

<b>VALUE</b>: The MR2 is a nimble, quick roadster.  When compared to the Mazda Miata, the MR2 seems more like a weekend toy, than a daily sports car.  Overall, I feel the Miata would be a better overall dollar value than the MR2 mainly because it is more usable for everyday situations.
