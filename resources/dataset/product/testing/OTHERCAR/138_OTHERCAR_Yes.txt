            I received this camera from my wonderful wife for Christmas this year after much thought.  I never really use a regular camera because I feel it is a hassle to deal with the photo finish labs, pay an exuberant amount for film development only to be disappointed.  Not anymore! This camera is great. For a beginner, the ease of use is comforting.  The pictures look great on the screen no matter what and the images print good on Kodak Photo paper.  The hint to producing good prints is to chose Soft on the cameras display.  Overall, an easy to use, general camera.  I'm well on my way to being a shutterbug.

Now that I have had time to really use the camera and try out the FREE Ofoto.com offer see my other article at : <a href='/cmd-review-775D-CD2247-38632DD4-bd1'>http://www.epinions.com/cmd-review-775D-CD2247-38632DD4-bd1</a> ), I am even more impressed with this camera.  The picture quality is outstanding, even in 640X480 mode.  
If anyone is interested in seeing some sample photos I took with this camera just let me know by emailing proline@shawneelink.net .  I would be more than happy to share my photos with you.

A word on the form factor, if I may.  The size and weight of this camera needs mentioning here.  Never before have I seen a megapixel camera so small.  Not saying they don't make them, but this is a real plus.  The camera easily fits into a shirt pocket or even a small purse.  This is one thing that I didn't even consider before but very important.

The flash on this camera is fantastic, too.  Bright, white light that even lights up the yard at night.  I recently got on the receiving end of this camera and man, it is bright.  So many settings, you can really customize the way you take pictures with the MX-1200.  Fuji really meant business when they designed this camera.  A slightly less than professional would make good use of the features or autopilot if you just want to shoot.
