            Bought this car from a rental company in December 1998.  It had 11k miles on it at the time.  In 3 years have put 190k miles on it.  I travel about 1000k miles a week so I spend a lot of time in it.  This car has served me well and will continue to do so.  Will be shooting for 250k and evaluate it from there.  The only major mechanical failure was the transmission had to be replaced at 59k due to a failed torque converter.  This had been a problem for these cars but consider that the transmission is a Ford built CD4E. The problem has since been resolved.  The replaced tranny has been fine.  The engine is remarkably solid for such a small motor.  I have the 2 liter 4 cylinder.  Burns no oil at all.  I change every 5k with synthetic.  This car is well maintained and it has paid off with its longevity.  Gets good gas mileage.  30 to 31 highway.  The only complaints I have with this car is the driver seat sits too low for my comfort and road noise could be less but is still satisfactory.  The following is a list of components I have replaced on the car except for oil, filters, and other fluid changes, tune-ups and drive belts. Most of these should be considered routine maintenance because of the high number of miles on the car:
3 timing belts - $700
4 new struts - $300 (did myself)
front brake pads - $40 (did myself)
front stabilizer bar - (replaced under warranty at 95k)
2 oxygen sensors - $150 (did myself)
timing belt tensioner - $400
battery - $50 (did myself)
glove box door - (replaced under warranty at 15k)
fuel filler pipe - $120 (did myself)
total - $1760 (not bad)
My advice for this car or any car:
1. stick to the maintenance schedule!
2. change the transmission fluid every 15K miles
3. get the 100k mile warranty - mine paid for itself when transmission was replaced 
4. do simple routine maintenance yourself if you can and you will save a lot of money
