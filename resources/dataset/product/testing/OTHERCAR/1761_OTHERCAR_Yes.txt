            I purchased this vehicle, because I had wanted a four door for some time and my father's lot had one.  I have the ES with V6 and automatic.  It fills my needs (four doors, leather, sunroof, ABS), but there are somethings that I wish were better (Auto trans, power, mileage). The car averages about 23mpg which I guess is alright, they recommend 91 octane, but I was told 89 would be alright.  I wish the suspension was more firm.
I plan on putting on a chip &amp; muffler system which should bring the power up to about 200.  I wish it was more prone to modification like my Civic.  Hondas are still the premium japanese brand, but the price is at a premium.  I am so used to manual transmission that I might be biased.<br><br>
