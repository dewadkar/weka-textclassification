            Yes, it's a fun test drive.  But, it's a pain to own.
--------

At 12 months and 20,000 miles, my 3.0i Suburban Assault Vehicle has been a disappointment.  It has already been recalled several times (from electronics to steering wheel problems).  It has been in the shop multiple times for other defects (cracked cord coverings, back gate problems, rear vent defects).  

The steering column covering has been replaced once already, yet still makes a horrendous noise when it extends and retracts.  The side mirrors frequently get stuck in the down position after backing up.  The latest is a squeak in the brakes at parking lot speeds which the dealer informs me can't be fixed; it's some sort of problem with the non-asbestos brake pads (gee, I don't hear it in the Lexus).  The dealer is helpful and all the work is waranteed.  Yet, this is not the level of quality that I had expected given my past experience with BMW's.  Our other BMW was in the shop once during the same time frame - and that was for it's annual inspection.

Friends with the same model report similar problems.  My dealer told me about one owner whose X5 shut down every time he went down a ramp in a parking lot.  It was found to be due to a faulty valve installation.  The dealership had to replace the vehicle.

There is no storage space in this car.  The center console holds a few CD's and BMW's custom cell phone - an overpriced ($900+), ancient Motorola flip up (not even a Startac, but the old, bulky model). There are four almost adequate cup holders.  Two "talls" from Starbucks barely fit in the front holders.  Anything larger and the passenger has to hold his own drink.  The back cup holders are very flimsy.  An accidental whack from a loaded school backpack will take them out completely.  If you are a smoker, rejoice, this is one of the few cars still made with built-in ash trays.   

This is a tiring car for long trips. The gas/brake pedals are placed a little too far towards the left. (I finally figured out that this is probably because it's configured to fit a clutch as well.) The driver's leg is forced into a slightly awkward position while driving - okay for short distances, but can cause cramps after 2+ hours. The bench style back seat is almost flat, not angled back, therefore there is little knee/leg support making long trips in the back very uncomfortable. The sport suspension makes going over pot holes and road humps great fun for back seat passengers (think school bus).

The V6 engine is underpowered for a car this size.  Attempting to merge onto a busy highway with the air conditioning running may be more excitement than you need.  That's with only the driver in the car.  Add a few people and luggage - someone had better be prepared to get out and push, even with the AC off.

We ordered ours with the built-in TV/VCR unit - an overpriced, under-engineered option. The earphones storage units were not well designed - the earphones fell out everytime we hit a bump. I fixed the problem with a bit of velcro (why didn't this occur to anyone at BMW?) The screen completely blocks the driver's view out the back.

On the positive side, this is still a BMW.  It handles beautifully.  Drivers of BMW sedans will disagree (my husband does) but I think anyone switching from another manufacturer/model, especially a minivan, will be happy.  The numerous safety features are a major plus.  

This car is a dream to drive in the torrential downpours that we get during the summer; it does not fishtale, it does not hydroplane. The rain sensors on the X5 sets the speed of the windshield wipers - one less distraction to worry about while driving through bad storms. 

The xenon headlights are a vast improvement over regular lights and are a must if you do a lot of night time driving in rural areas. The increase in visibility is worth the extra cost. The parking device can be annoying sometimes but is a must if you have dogs or need to parallel park frequently.  


Be warned, gas mileage on this vehicle is under 16mpg (20mpg highway, sometimes).  It only takes premium gas. 

The X5 is made in South Carolina.
