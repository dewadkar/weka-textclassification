            The Nissan Maxima is one fine automobile.  I have a 1998 Maxima SE in Sterling Mist (kind of a grey color) and it is certainly a striking car, visually. Of course, the Maxima's quality doesn't stop there. The interior is remarkably roomy - as spacious as any luxury car I have driven, yet it is not unwieldy or &quot;boat&quot;-like, as many other full-size sedans are. No sir.  This vehicle is as nimble and easy to maneuver in and out of traffic as any sports car I have owned.  The Maxima truly can get up and GO, and the 2000 model is even faster.  The Bose stereo system can thump like any punk high-schooler's can, and the car gives a rather  quiet, smooth ride.  I HIGHLY recommend the Nissan Maxima if you are looking for a full-size car that doesn't have DORK or FOGEY written all over it. This car has class and a great deal of spunk at the same time. You won't be disappointed, trust me!! <br><br>
