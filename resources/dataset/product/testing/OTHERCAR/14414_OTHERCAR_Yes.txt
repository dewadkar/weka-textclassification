            I have driven the car for 3400 miles so far and have become very familiar with it by now. I am averaging 18.5 miles to the gallon around town with the air off which borders on unbelievable for a 340 h.p. V8. 

The onboard computer makes it easy to keep track of the mileage on both a current and historical basis. There is an easy to read display that you can turn off if you don't like it - I leave it on to monitor gas mileage. You can store up to, I think, the 10 last tankfuls(manual reset required) in a bar graph. The computer also keeps track of either a 3.75K or 7.5K maintenance schedule. I didn't think I would use the voice recognition technology, but man, was I was I wrong. It is a truly great standard option. I particularly love the analog clock.

I traded in a BMW 740I for this so I'm familiar with sporty luxury automobiles. My wife still drives my old BMW 540I and I can tell you that this car is quicker after it gets going in normal driving situations - not a little quicker either, a LOT QUICKER. Off the line it's six of one, half dozen of another which feels faster. Braking is excellent but definitely not as fluid a feel as the BMW's whom have braking down to a science.

When considering handling characteristics, the M45 compares favorably with the 540I and better than the 740I. These are the only newer cars I'm familiar with to compare against. I couldn't tell enough from a test drive of other vehicles to compare anything except overall stiffness. I live in Florida and, if you've been there, you already know it's pretty hard to find a windy road but the few I have encountered were negotiated with ease. The vehicle dynamic control is excellent - really keeps you out of trouble. Infiniti realized that it could be a little pervasive so they gave you an on/off switch. They exercised thought when they automatically reset it to "on" position when you restart the ignition. The M45 is a very stiff ride with the 18"'s - not too stiff though, just right for my tastes.

While this is no 7 series, or even 540I for that matter, it is certainly no slouch. The cabin is ultra comfortable. And both cooled and heated front seats! The only other cars that have that are well over 20K pricier. The drivers left arm rest in the 7 series was so low as to be utterly useless and the 540I isn't much better. While I would have rather had the CD player in the dash instead of the Tape Player, at least the changer is in the glove compartment instead of the trunk like the 7 series. 

The M45 has been well thought out in regards to creature comfort. The longest ride I've been on yet was about 4 hours but I arrived as if I had been in my Barkolounger all afternoon. I averaged 24.5 on that trip and had the cruise set at 78. Mine came in Diamond Graphite - awesome color. It also had the comfort package and 18" chrome wheels - beautiful. 

I was only able to negotiate 2K from list but the car had only been out a week. I also got them to throw in a rear spoiler - uninstalled - to cover the phony $500 doc prep charge - what a ripoff. I installed the spoiler myself in a Saturday afternoon. Need to check the air pressure? Not a problem - sensors in the wheels make that possible without leaving the driver's seat. 

I find the Bose stereo more than adequate but if I was into exaggerated bass, I would probably be adding a subwoofer. The M45 also has an Economy A/C mode which still runs the compressor but saves gas. July days in Florida will probably require the full A/C but we'll see. From my best guess, I would say that you lose 2mpg with A/C and 1mpg in economy mode. 

I looked at Audi, Saab, Volvo, Lexus GS430, and Jaguar and they really couldn't touch the performance of this car for anywhere near the money. This car probably won't sell but that is sad because it is the best deal out there if you're into V8 performance like I am. This is one of the best power plants out there. I'm not totally enamored with the transmission but I've been told that the tranny can be tweaked with software programming. It really isn't that bad - just a little erratic. The manual shift pales in comparison to Tiptronic but it is adequate and definitely a lot better than not having it at all. 

This car is so smooth and so fast that if the dealers can get people behind the wheel, they will be able to sell them. On the other hand, having an exclusive car is pretty neat too. I get more comments with this car than I ever did with the 5 or the 7 series plus they don't have that instant hate factor that bimmers suffer from with some people. I feel very safe with front, side, and curtain air bags. I highly recommend this car. This is a 2003 automobile - the Epinions pulldown only goes to 2002.
