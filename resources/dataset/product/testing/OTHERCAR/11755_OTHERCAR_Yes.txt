            Those who have read my reviews must think I own a camera shop. LOL.. no, but photography is a hobby, and I've bought a few cameras in recent months.  Hey, I don't drink or smoke, and haven't gone to a movie in over a year - I have to waste money on <b>something</b>.  Actually, I buy these things, keep them at work, use them on my lunch hour, and enjoy letting others know about them.  Not a bad way to spend lunch, doing something you enjoy.

<b>THE DC-3200 BY KODAK</b>

The DC-3200 has been on the market for a number of months now, which is actually a long time in digital camera terms.  Like one year to a dog is seven to us, six months in the digital camera world is an eternity, with new models coming out almost too quickly for folks to catch up on.  This is a "get it while you can" item however, and I do recommend it.

<b>THE GOOD</B>

Ease of use is the key with this camera.  If you cannot figure this thing out on your own or with the help of the well-written manual, then you need to just give up and use disposable film cameras from K-mart.  The DC-3200 is really <b>that</b> easy to use.  

With this camera, you get a connection cable that with the included software, will allow you to transfer photos you've taken into the computer.  You get 4 Kodak "Photolife" AA batteries, a wrist strap, camera (of course) and manual.  You can begin taking photos right out of the box.

The LCD screen on the back and menu button gives you access to all of the camera's features.  It's very easy to understand what each "command" on the screen allows you to do.  A "select" button lets you select which option you wish to change.  The manual of course, walks you through step-by-step, but many of the commands are easy to figure out without even looking at the book.

You have two photo sizes to choose from:  1152 x 864 pixels, which will appear very large on your monitor, and is the size you'll need for printing photos.  In that size, you have two "quality" settings, being "better" and "best".  Best offers the lowest compression of the photos, which means the photo is "cleaner", but will only allow you to take about 6 photos before filling the camera memory.  The "better" option allows you to take more photos, but slightly degrades the image quality.  The third option is "good", which also decreases the photo size to 576 x 432 pixels, just slightly over half of most monitors screen size - a good size choice if you know you're going to save photos only for on-screen viewing.

Other options you can adjust are several settings for different lighting conditions, the ability to turn the flash on automatic, always on, or always off, and various other controls for viewer photos you've taken on the camera's LCD screen, erasing them, and more.

Photo quality is actually quite good for a camera in this price range, and with a "fixed-focus" lens; that is, a lens that does not use an infrared beam to focus on your subject, but is pre-focuses on a wide range.  The lens being glass instead of plastic adds to the quality.  You will want to take as many photos as you can in the largest size and "best" setting, but even the lower settings are not that bad.  Photos of subject in the 7-18 foot range from you are generally very good and reasonably sharp.  Long distance objects (such as mountains) will lack a bit a detail since this is a fixed-focus camera, and not an auto-focus.  There is no real zoom (called an Optical Zoom) on this camera, but there is a 2 X "digital" zoom - one that crops and enlarges the central part of a photo.  This leaves you with a degraded image, but if you need to get closer to a subject, it does give you the option.

<b>THE BAD</b>

All is not perfect however, with this camera.  You are in this price range, dealing with an all-plastic body, and not super sturdy plastic at that.  To some, this camera feels more like a toy than a "real" camera, but it is a good working model.  You do not, however,  want to drop this camera on a hard floor, even at a low distance, so keep the wrist strap around your wrist when handling it!

As with many digital cameras, battery consumption is <b>enormous</b>.  Use the LCD screen as little as possible to help, and if possible, buy a set (or two) of NiMh rechargeable batteries and a charger.  If you <b>must</b> use throwaway batteries, buy AA Duracell ULTRA brand, as they seem to work well with high drain items like this.

There is no lens cover with this camera, nor a cap.  You must take care not to bump the lens against objects, or treat the camera harshly.  The lens is recessed into the body some however, which somewhat helps to protect it. The camera does not have a self timer, or a red eye reduction mode on the flash - they could have been included, Kodak! 

The DC-3200 allows you to use Compact Flash memory cards to extend the photo memory.  With an 8 megabyte card installed, the camera uses it instead of the internal memory, and your "best" photo storage will increase from about 6 to around 22.  You can of course buy a 16, 32, or 64 meg card to extend the memory even further.  A USB card reader is a device that plugs in to the back of your computer, and allows you to remove the camera card, and download your photos to the computer that way - a much faster method than connecting the camera directly, and it does not use the camera batteries to do so.  There is no card included with the camera however, so this will be an additional charge.

Expect a slight shutter delay, especially when taking flash photos.  When you press the shutter button to take a photo with the flash "on", there will be a second or so delay before the camera takes the photo.  Hold it still to avoid getting a blurred photo.  Annoying, but workable.  The flash is also a bit too strong, so when taking photos of people, you must stand at least 7 or so feet away, to avoid flushing their skin tones out.

<b>THE MISC.</b>

If I haven't put you to sleep yet, here's the "Grade":  In terms of ease of use, I give this camera a solid "A".  Photo quality = "C+", and what you get with it a "C-", since you have to spend more to get a memory card (which I feel should have been included with the camera).  For someone's first digital camera, or one for the kids/teens, this is an excellent choice.  You do not want it for those cherished European vacation photos, but as a day-to-day casual use camera, it's just fine, especially at today's price of $149.00.
