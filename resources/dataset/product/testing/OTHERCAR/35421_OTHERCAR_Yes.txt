            The Mini name has quite a history in the US and Europe, although only genuine auto enthusiasts stateside will recognize the name. The Austin Mini was first built and sold in England in 1959. The original goal of the Mini was to offer British families a good, affordable car that offered some sporting fun as well. Even though the Austin Mini frequently gets credit for being the first. Mass-produced front-wheel drive car, the Citroen Traction Avant actually pre-dates the Mini by more than a decade. Still, it is the loveable little Mini that first made many Americans aware of front-wheel drive. With plenty of racing success, the early Mini, Mini Cooper and later, the larger Austin America proved that there was more to American automotive life than just V8s and rear-wheel drive.

BMW now owns the Mini name, and it&#146s BMW that has engineered the new Mini. Clearly a reinterpretation of the original Mini in spirit, style and performance, the new Mini seems to be enjoying ten times the recognition and success of the original that inspired it. And with good reason, the Mini Cooper and Mini Cooper S offer lots of fun and &#147look at me&#148 coolness for about the same price as Toyota Corolla or a loaded Honda Civic.

The new Mini is available in two styles, Cooper and Cooper S, the S being the performance model boasting a 163-hp, supercharged engine, and stiffer suspension.

The Mini accelerates with enthusiasm and with just enough noise to remind you this is a sports car. Handling is perfect with the car feeling stable and well balanced in virtually all driving situations. A quick run through the slalom brings a smile to the driver&#146s face as the little car seems to beg for &#147just one more turn&#148 like an eager puppy on his morning walk. Thanks to an electro magnetic system, steering feel is terrific and gives the driver a connectedness to the road that other sporting cars cannot match.

The clutch is surprisingly light, but the shift lever clicks into each slot with precision. Brakes are excellent and offer the same go-kart like connectedness as the steering. 

The Mini is not a big car, but interior room is surprisingly adequate. Adults can ride in the back for short trips, but tall individuals will want to make it a short trip. Rear seats fold down with ease to offer expanded cargo room, but this car will never substitute for the family minivan in terms of hauling ability. The mostly spacious interior is notable more for its look rather than abundant functionality. Inside, the Mini is decked out in all the retro-fun the sassy car can hold. 

A large, round speedometer sits right in the middle of the dash, and chrome toggle switches (similar to the original) control such functions as power windows and door locks. Cooper S offers a rally style tach bolted to the steering column.

Mini didn&#146t leave safety out of the equation  - the Cooper S comes standard with ABS, head air bags, de-powered air bags for both front seat occupants, side air bags, passenger air bag deactivation switch, and traction control. A stability control system is optional.

The Mini is simply a thrill to drive, although the sporty S model can feel a bit harsh for everyday commuting and on long trips. As a daily driver the normally aspirated and softer sprung Cooper would be the way to go. However it is hard to overlook the inherent fun of a 2700 lb, supercharged car with a 6-speed manual transmission and 16-inch wheels shod with P195/55R16 tires. The Cooper S is the perfect weekend car for enthusiasts on a budget.

Overall, the Mini Cooper is worth all the hoopla and stays true to the original&#146s mission &#150 affordable, fun transportation with a good dose of style and performance. Everyone drives a Civic, live a little &#150 the Mini is calling you. If there is a more fun, functional and sporty car out there for $20,000 we haven&#146t found it.
