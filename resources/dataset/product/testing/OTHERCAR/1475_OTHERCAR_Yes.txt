            Driving the Escalade is like, well, driving a Cadillac. It is very comfortable and fun to drive.
It is missing some important Cadillac features...like Memory Seats..like Climate Control..like a plug to plug your trailer lights in.

I compared this car with the Navigator, and even though I like every feature in the Navigator, the Cadillac is just more comfortable to sit in.

The Navigator had a very hard seat.

The Onstar System is very cool to play with, but I don't think it is worth the approx. $20 per month. Anybody with a cellular phone could duplicate most of the features.

The heated seats are wonderful. There could be more room in the back seat. I felt the Navigator was roomier, but the specs say no.

It should have volume for radio and fan controls in the steering wheel.
