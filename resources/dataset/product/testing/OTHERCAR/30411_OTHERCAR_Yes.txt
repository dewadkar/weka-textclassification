            I purchased the Suburban because I needed room for medical equipment for work and ski gear for play. The amount of secure storage is limited to the inside of the car and is barely long enough to accommodate skis, poles and peripheral gear. To accommodate these items, one must purchase additional bolt-on rooftop storage containers, which are extremely UNsecure while the vehicle is parked on city streets. There should be under-floor storage, but there isn't, making a specific lack of lockable interior stowage. Also the second and third tier of seats allow, respectively, little and severely-limited legroom for passengers.

On the other hand, the vehicle runs great and the Vortec power plant is wonderful on fuel economy. The rise for the front seat passenger and driver is relaxing and luxurious and the vehicle is well-styled and impressive. It's off-road capacity is surprisingly agile for such a large frame. 

All in all, I would purchase the truck again, but with the knowledge that I'd need a very well-integrated, lockable rooftop storage unit.<br><br>
