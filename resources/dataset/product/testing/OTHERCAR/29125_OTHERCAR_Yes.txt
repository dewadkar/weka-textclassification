            This truck is great. I leased it in 1998 as a 1999 model and took delivery right off the rack truck. It now has over 60,000 miles and is still doing great. It has never been in the shop for anything. Nothing has gone wrong with it.Everyday I travel over 70 miles to work and enjoy it. This truck came in handy when I hooked a chain to the hitch and pulled out a couple tree stumps the other day with the greatest of ease. I am completly pleased but sad when my lease will be up. Hopefully i will be able to get another excellent truck.<br><br>
