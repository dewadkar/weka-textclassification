            My husband and I got a Cavalier after he got rid of a very expensive truck (and very expensive payments). We actually got the Rally Sport coupe model. The car was fantastic and did very well for over 2 1/2 years. The only reason I got rid of it was because I was sick of driving a stick shift.

The car is very sleek, with a great paint job! It had a built-in CD Player/radio, nice interior, and a lot of room for being a 2-door car. The car also got excellent gas mileage. We averaged 34 MPG on the highway. 

The car was very easy to drive, especially for a stick. We did not have one ounce of problems with this car during the time that we had it. It ran very smoothly, with no engine or mechanical problems whatsoever.

If you're looking for a smaller, fun, economical car, this is the car for you!
