            I am a Technology Coordinator for a small school district in Texas so we do not have a lot of money to waste. I researched this camera for about a month before purchasing two for the district. This camera by far is the best I have seen at taking action and still shots. I recommend it highly in that it is very versatile. It uses a diskette to capture the images on instead of the cumbersome cords and wires that other cameras require. It takes beautiful color photos inside and outside. We have used the camera to take pictures of students in various sports related events as well as district U.I.L. meets. I do have a one gripe about the camera in that there is NO red eye reduction. But with all the other bells and whistles you hardly miss this function. It has a True 16X zoom for those distant shots and can grab an image that is only 6 inches away from you. I believe that Sony has come up with a winner in this camera line.<br><br>
