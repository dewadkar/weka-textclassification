            Well, I guess nothing is really completely free. But, the great little Celica GT comes as close as any car does. I helped my daughter buy one brand new in the summer of 1993. She drove it, hard, for five years, at college, to work and back and forth between North Carolina and Northern Virginia. She got a few dents, and probably didn't change the oil more than once every 10k miles (probably?- c'mon Dad- you KNOW she only had it changed when she was home visiting!)

In early 98, with over 60,000 miles, she wanted something bigger for her business. So Dad traded her his Mercury Sable wagon, and agreed to sell the Celica for her. I was amazed to get $10,000 for a car we had only paid $16,000 for new, five years before. This works out to only $.10 a mile to drive a really fun, stable and extremely reliable car.

Our Celica was the GT- up from the base, but not the big engine in the GTS. It was a 5 speed- the only thing that makes sense in a sports car, and was bright red. We equipped it with a manual sunroof at the dealer.

The Celica was always fun, very stable, with a nice design that provided lots of room inside. We drove it home once (my wife and I) with all our luggage, plus 2 50lb dogs! A lot of fun, for very little money.<br><br>
