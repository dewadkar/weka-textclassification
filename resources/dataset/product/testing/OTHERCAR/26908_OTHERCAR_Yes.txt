            I recently bought my first toyota- a camry dx with 143,000 miles already on it. I guess most people would think I am crazy but I knew if what I heard about it was true I had gotten a steal. I go everywhere in it and i use it on my paper route daily. Other than routine oil changes I have done no repairs to it.It runs like a top and is great on gas mileage which is very good considering gas prices these days. I give it 5 stars and highly recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a nice car, low cost, low repair bills, nice riding, and ease of handling. It is truely a wonderful car.<br><br>
