            In getting my first car..I can proudly say I made a good decision.  I have a 1992 Nissan Maxima with about 110,000 miles on it.  They aren't highway miles, but then again, they really aren't city miles either.  This car has been a pleasure to drive, own, and to maintain.  Oh wait, that's right, I don't have to maintain it! In the 9 years I've had this car, the only thing I've had to fix/replace are the brakes.
   Forget maintenance..this car is a joy to drive!  I was skeptical when i saw the &quot;4DSC&quot; (4 door sports car) sticker on the car window, but I am truly amazed what this car can do.  It's no ferrari when it comes to pickup and handling, but it's close enough to fool me.  The engine gets a little loud when you rev it to get good pickup, but most cars will do that. :)  As for handling, when the thought of turning enters your mind, chances are the car has already begun to turn.  I wouldn't say it is a touchy car handling-wise, but it's response time is above average to say the least.  
   Inside the car, the seats are very comfortable, and for both the drive and three more passengers, there is enough leg room and head room to go around.  The middle seat in the back is a little skimpy, but I have yet to see a mid-sized car with one that isn't.  All the gadgets are conveniently located, except for the trunk button which is on the door, instead of on the floor of the car where most release buttons are.  The cruise control is a little deceiving as well, because you need to push a button on panel of the car to the left of the steering wheel, and then set it on cruise control by using the buttons actually on the steering wheel.  The built in cup holders block the radio, which sometimes is a pain.  Other than that though, everything inside the car is perfect.  There are arm rests and grips (on the door and ceiling of the car for holding on to while getting in and out of the car).  The clock is above the radio, so it doesn't interfere with the display like in some other cars.  The car has a spacious trunk that can hold a few reasonable sized suitcase.  It also has a small little release door in the back seats of the car to fit long objects through.
   I could go on forever talking about the qualities of this car.  What is important is the reliablity, convenience, and the overall quality of the car.  I know when it's time to buy a new one (if that time ever comes!!) the first place I will go is back to my Nissan dealer! <br><br>
