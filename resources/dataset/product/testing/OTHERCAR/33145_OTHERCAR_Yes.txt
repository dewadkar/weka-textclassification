            While my car was in the shop, I was given a 2000 Malibu for the weekend as a rent car.  I used it to go out of town.  The car can be described in four words:  EXCELLENT IN EVERY WAY!  

When I was sitting in this car, I really felt like I was at home in this car.  It has plenty of interior space.  The dashboard gauges were easy to read.  As for radio and climate controls, there was no problem trying to reach them.  The seats were very comfortable as well.

The Malibu has plenty of power as well.  The engine is a 3.1L V-6, with plenty of power for passing.  It was matted with a 4-speed automatic transmission.  It shifted nice and quietly.  It handled very nicely.  Some people might say the steering is a little loose, but it did not bother me at all.  This car performs very well for a sedan.  I had no problems with exterior appearance.  The only thing I would change on this car is the size of the tires.  They need to be a little bit bigger.  

I think that the Malibu is one of the best cars Chevrolet has to offer.  It was hard for me to give it up when I got my car out of the shop.  The next time I shop around for a car, Malibu will be on the shopping list.  It should be on yours, too.<br><br>
