            I researched digital cameras for a few months, both online and in my local stores, before I finally made a purchase. There are cameras out there with higher MegaPixels and more &quot;gadgets&quot;, but for the average user, this camera is the best value for your money. 

It's a 2.1 MegaPixel, and unless you're going to take professional photos, don't waste you money on 3 MegaPixel or higher. The features are great, the onscreen menu is easy to use once you've read the book. 

I got this camera a few days before Christmas, and took about 150 pictures over the first week I had it. They turned out terrific! And I didn't even use SHQ (Super High Quality)...I only used HQ (High Quality). The software that comes with it is the fanciest, but very useful. It includes the ability to crop, resize, add text to the picture, reduce red-eye, add sound to the picture, and a lot more I haven't got into yet. 

It tells you how many pictures you have remaining, according to the size of memory card you're using. It has a fill-in flash mode, which only flashes when it's needed. Basically, all you have to do once it's set up the way you want it (which is simple) is point and shoot. 

It's a durable camera, and fits in your hand nicely. It comes with an 8 MB memory card (allows 16 pictures on the HG setting). I checked most retail stores, and it sold for $399 - $499. I used www.mysimon.com (highly recommended) to find the lowest price on the net, and found it for $375....brand new! 

When I ordered, I was offered a special package which included the camera, a 32 MB memory card (allows 64 pictures using HG), a USB card reader(a must have), and a set of rechargeable batteries with the charger...for $599. This was through www.turboprice.com. 

So, over all, for the average person (not wanting to take professional photos)this camera is by far the best value for the money. Don't waste money on a 3 MP camera or higher, 2 MP gives you great quality pictures for less money.  <br><br>
