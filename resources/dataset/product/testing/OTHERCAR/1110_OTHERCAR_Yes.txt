            After putting my Suburban through rigorous and extensive driving conditions, this is by far the greatest vehicle I have ever owned. Check this out: I drove my Suburban from San Jose, California through Mexico and on to Guatemala! I took it hill climbing in the hot Baja Desert, raced through hurricane ravaged mountain terrain in the jungles of Chiapas, and drove through flash flooded desert rivers in desolate regions. And most of this extreme driving was done when the Suburban had over 70,000 miles! When I got back from the Mexico/Guatemala trip I felt sure that my Suburban would be at a minimum out of alignment. To my surprise the alignment was still within specs! It now has over 100,000 miles and I'm using it for the daily commute in Silicon Valley. I've had it serviced regularly according to the manufacture's schedule, and not once have I experienced serious mechanical problems. Obviously the gas mileage is not great, but better than I expected. I average around 16 to 18 miles/gallon on the freeway. The only knock I have is that the Suburban uses a lot of oil. This is normal, but irritating. With a 42 gallon gas tank, I need to put in a quart of oil every 2 to 3 fill ups. Other than that it drives like a Cadillac, climbs like a mountain goat, and is as tough as they come!<br>
