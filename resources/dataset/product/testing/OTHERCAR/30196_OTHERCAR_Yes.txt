            My family has had a 1992 dodge Caravan around for over 7 years now.  It is still running great without major problems.  The Van just hit 100,000 Miles a few months ago.  It seats 7 people comfortably.  I'm not talking aboiut 7 kids.  I am talking 5 adults and two kids, plus a bunch of luggage.  So If you are looking for a sporty van to haul your stuff around, this is the van to do it in.  The acceleration is good, and runs fine at higher speeds.  Highly recommended.  Very nice minivan for the price.  <br><br>
