            I own a 1994 Jeep Wrangler SE.  I love it, but it's not for everybody.  If you like a car where road sounds are non-existent, you don't want the Wrangler. You hear everything with the soft top and only slightly less with the hard top.  If you have half doors or soft doors, you won't be able to hear the radio.  

I love my Wrangler.  I have wanted one since I first heard of the concept of ownership.  I have a great deal of fun in my Jeep and I find that I am a better driver in it than I was in my previous car (1991 Mitsubishi Eclipse).  I just got my beach permit and can't wait to take it out onto the sand.  However, before buying one, there are some things you should be aware of.

1. The Jeep Wrangler did not come with automatic transmissions until sometime around 1993 or 1994.  So, if you are looking for a used Jeep and can't drive stick, you are going to have to go for a relatively new Jeep and they do hold their value.  I have also been told that the automatic is something of a dog unless you have 6 cylinders.  If you can't drive a stick shift, you are missing out on the true Jeep experience, I know I am.

2. The Jeep is not a quiet ride.  You will hear "road" sounds.  Soft tops tend to flap at higher speeds adding to the noise.  I just pump the music up and ignore it.

3. The ride in a Jeep is not smooth.  Most people don't realize that SUVs in general are not built for smooth rides on Highways.  Only luxury SUVs have that designed into them.  Due to the high center of gravity, the vehicle does move and bounce with the road.  Personally, that is one of the things I love about the Jeep, but I know a few people who have been surprised by it.

4. Sound systems for the Jeep are not all that abundant.  Unless you choose to remove all of your trunk space by putting a set of speakers behind the back seats, you are limited to custom fit boxes in weird positions throughout the Jeep or the sound bar.  I have been told by numerous people that the sound bar is a complete waste of money.  Once the top comes off, the speakers become useless.  I've got a set of speakers in small boxes sitting on the wheel wells, but I am not sure what I am going to do with them once the top comes off.  

5. Security.  The Jeep is not for people who are paranoid about theft.  It's been said that a Jeep can be stripped to it's frame with nothing more than a screw driver.  Hard doors and top and a dual lock for the hood will make the Jeep as secure as most vehicles, but then the Jeep isn't as much fun.  Consider alarms, hood locks, and ignition kill systems when shopping for a Jeep.  Diehard has a new battery with security built in that I might give a try.

6. Storage.  Similar to security, the Jeep has very little in the way of storage.  I have a box I keep behind the rear seat which is screwed into place, and a center console, but these are not standard items and are not all that secure when the top is off.  They also don't store a whole lot. If you are a pack rat, this is not the vehicle for you, unless you never have more than 2 people in the vehicle at any time and can afford to replace the rear seat with a storage box.


I love my jeep.  It's a blast to drive, it's not the typical bubble shape of all of the other cars made today, it's tough and there are tons of little toys and accessories you can add to it.  It's also fairly simple mechanically speaking.  I have been bold enough to do a tune up and minor repairs to the jeep myself, saving myself several hundred dollars in mechanic fees.  It's has the best of both the winter and summer vehicles.  Convertible for the summer, 4-wheel drive for the winter.  It's just not for everybody.


:New note added 5/1/2000:

I put the soft top on this weekend and got to the beach.  First sun burn of the season!  Drives great on the beach, but you have got to remember to air down those tires. :)

A few notes on the change over from hard top to a soft top.  If you live in an area where it is warm enough, don't even bother with the hard top.  They are expensive and the heating system in every jeep I have been in has no problem keeping the Jeep and driver warm even with the soft top.

Unfortunately, here in New York, you need a hard top for the winter.  To do the swap from hard top to soft took me and a friend about half an hour to do at an even slow pace.  The first time we did it, we did it without instructions and we still managed to get it done in about an hour and a half.  The hard part, that first time, was trying to figure out what parts went were and whether we had all the parts or not.  

Now that the soft top is on, I can take the top down in 2 or 3 minutes.  It takes a few minutes longer to put it back up, probably because I usually end up trying to put it back up after dark.

If you have all of the original pieces, no tools should be necessary.  I have replaced two hand screws with other screws (lost by previous owner) so I have to have a screw driver.

One note on beach travel.  When heading over an incline, even if it is rather small. try to take it as close to head on as possible.  You don't want to learn the hard way.  I nearly did.  My Jeep pulled out of my idiot manuever none the less.

And that's one to grow on.

-- Another Update --

I'm still loving it.  However, at the current price for gas, the gas mileage is becoming a factor.  I've heard of worse, but 14-16 miles per gallon is not good.  Especially since my fiance lives 40 miles away.  Between the short trip to the train station and the trip out to her place every weekend, I end up dropping over $50 a month into the gas tank.

Noise is definitely an issue.  I'm OK with it, but you have to consider passengers feelings too.  I've had a good number of people say they love riding in my jeep, but couldn't take the noise or the wind for long trips.

-- Yet another update

The role of my Jeep has changed.  I'm now living with my Fiance and the Jeep is used strictly for commuting to the train station.  I still love it.  However, I must reiterate that the Jeep is not a very secure vehicle.  

My jeep has been broken into twice in less than 6 months.  Both times, they only took my rear speakers and other minor items.  One time they just unzipped the windows to get in.  If you are going to leave your Jeep in a parking lot all day long, either have the hard top on it or don't leave anything of value in it.  The hard top won't stop a theif.  The second time they smashed my drivers side window to get in.  I no longer have rear speakers.  It just ain't worth replacing them.

I have had to invest some money in a new transmission.  I understand that 80,000 miles is still young for a transmission.  New Jeeps now have a 100,000 mile warrantee.   My guess is that either the previous owner abuse the transmission, or that since 1994 was one of the first years for Automatic transmissions in the Jeep, that there is a problem with the initial design.
