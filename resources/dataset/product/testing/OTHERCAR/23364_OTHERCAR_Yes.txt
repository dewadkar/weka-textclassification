            I am a big fan of both SUVs and Mercedes, so naturally I love this car.  It is not only powerful, it is luxurious too.  This car is sleek and beautiful and drives like a dream.  Some of you may not like SUVs, or Mercedes for that matter.  If you don't like either, then this car may make you think twice about both of them.  For those of you who want to cruise in style this is absolutely a car for you.  Take this car for a drive and I guarantee you a pleasant surprise, for it is definitely worth it.<br><br>
