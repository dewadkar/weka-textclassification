            We bought a 2002 SC1 (used) to replace my venerable '83 Toyota Tercel wagon (231,000 miles, but starting to lose power and rattling more).  We did our internet homework and narrowed our choices down to Honda 2dr Civics and the Saturn SCs.  The claimed mileage on FuelEconomy.gov helped in this winnowing down.  We wanted a car that got at least 35 mpg since I do a lot of driving.  The SC1 (SOHC) with standard transmission claimed 40 mpg, and the Honda 'only' claimed 39.  The SC2 (DOHC) with standard claimed 38, so we zeroed in on an SC1 that was in our price range, and found we could get a 2002.  There were 5 for sale at three different dealers, and we bought our 'new' car after test driving it and doing the used-car-price dance, which we do well since we've lived in Asia where the price on EVERYTHING is negotiable.  I have been driving it to work (150 mile round trip every day) for two weeks now, and absolutely love it.  It has plenty of pep for an economy car, the styling is pleasing to the eye and aerodynamic, and I have gotten 41, 42 and 41 mpg on the three tanks of gas I have put through it.  The neat little 'upshift' light really helps maximize the mileage, but you can 'wind it up' if you have to pass some Hummer that's in the way (getting his 8 mpg)!  I am 70" tall (5'10"), and find the seat quite comfortable (the springs in the seat in my old Toyota had worn out, and I had to sit on a firm foam pad to keep my back from hurting).  I read all the reviews of this model here before buying, so I am trusting your collective judgement about the reliability of Saturns.  All in all, this is a great little car for what I bought it for: long commutes at cruising speeds (65 mph).  The people who 'hate' this car would probably whine if you hung them with a NEW rope!
