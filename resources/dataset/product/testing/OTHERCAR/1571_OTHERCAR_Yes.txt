            Hello As the owner or two Chrysler products mini vans i must confess that they are the best running and most easy to maintain vehicles that i have owned. I curently drive 800 mlles a week on my 1995 Dodge Grand Caravan without any thing having to be done other than standard maintaince with 76,000 miles i am confandant that i will see over 200,000 on this vehicle before it needs any major repairs. My wifes 1995 Plymouth Grand Voyager has 41,000 miles and has never seen the shop other than standard maintainace and is tight as a new model. Thru my job i have driven Dodge, Plymouth or Chrysler mini vans since they were interduced by Lee Iacoca in 1984 and have log over 600,000 miles on different models without missing a single model year. The greatest things about driving this vehice is its car like dring and handling, great visablity in trafic and super fuel mileage for it size ( i have averaged 19mpg in a high altuide location with metro and highway driving daily).I can give no negative input on these vans, try one you will yove them!<br><br>
