            We were in need of a New Vehicle but I was between Jobs so we looked for an inexpensive car.  What we found was in expensive, but not Cheep, EVERY part of the car rings out quality.  

We have most of the options, which aren't many because almost everything comes standard, the only thing we didn't get were Leather Seats and a Sunroof. A small list of standard features include Power Windows with Lock, power Locks, 4 wheel vented disk brakes with anti-lock, Aluminum Wheels, Dual air bags, Alarm and keyless entry, CD &amp; Tape Stereo, luggage rack, folding side mirrors with remote adjustment and heat, Tilt, Cruse and may more.

The power plant is Quality as well, its 2.0 Liters and 4 cylinders has more than enough torque and Horse Power to keep up with traffic, even with an automatic Transmission. It is a pleasure to drive in the City and on the freeway it can defiantly handle the fast lane, on long trips you better use the Cruse Control because you can be going 80 mph and not even realize it, that is how smooth this car is.

As a grocery getter it is excellent, the rear lift gate pops up and out of the way and unlocks with the keyless entry, the back has tie downs, ample storage space and the deck is made out of Stamped steel not cheap card board, it pops up to revel the spare tire and more storage space, the rear seat folds down if need be and it even has a cargo screen if you don't want others to see your stuff.

The styling is Great, It is a good looking car, inside and out, the visibility is first rate, it has a large Green House and small blind spots. The layout of the interior is just right with nothing out of reach, it has full gages which are analog White on Black and are easy to read. The seats are very comfortable even on long trips, and are 4 ways adjustable. 

You can tell that attention was spent in the details even the cup holders are Cool as they pop out with the push of a button.

We haven't had any problems in the 9 months we have owned it, and the gas Mileage is still improving above the sticker amounts with every fill up.

Our only gripe would be sometimes steamy windows, but we fixed that with careful use of the air recalculation button.

This is a great car, everyone should have one, the Quality and list of standards and options are far above what we expected especially for a car that was $3000 less than the nearest stripped Domestic model.

If you buy this car you won't regret it.
