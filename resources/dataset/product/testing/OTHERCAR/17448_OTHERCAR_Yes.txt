            I purchased a 97 Prelude SH about 2 1/2 years ago and have not been disappointed at all.  Other than regular oil changes the car has only been into the shop twice.  Once for a recall on the ball joints and once because the ATTS failed.

I drive this car a lot because my daily commute is 35 miles each way.  Although the manual transmission can be a pain in traffic, the extra quick pick-up this car has is ideal for quick lane changes and you will truly love it when you can open it up on the freeway.

I am now selling my car and want everyone to know that I am finding that it held its value incredibly well.  Even with 41K miles on it, CarMax is offering me more than I still owe.  Both Honda and the Prelude have an excellent quality reputation and this pays off in the aftermarket.  This is the second Prelude I have owned (also had an 88) and the excellent trade-in value was true of that car as well.

I highly recommend the Honda Prelude as an entry level sports sedan for those people who want to have fun driving and don't want to ferry around all of their friends (there really is no backseat to speak of, especially if you are over 6').<br><br>
