            This is not your average SUV.  This vehicle is a true four-wheel drive.  It is a truck.  Does it have little noises here and there?  Yes!  Does it roll around the corners a bit?  Yes!  It's a TALL vehicle.  It's not going to ride like a car when it comes to those things.  As for the repair problems that some people are reporting, let's keep in mind that Land Rover has only been in this country since 1987, so as far as finding parts and diagnostics, it's a bit more difficult than some of the vehicles that have been here quite awhile.  Remember, the Japanese cars had this same problem 10-15 years ago. 

My husband is an import car dealer and buys and sells 20 of these every year.  They are our favorite vehicle to drive.  We have a 1996 Disco SE on our lot right now and drive it at 80 mph every day without problems. 

The check engine light problem has come up a few times with vehicles he has purchased, however in these cases, it has been related to an O2 sensor. Once this is replaced, for a cost of about $200, we have had no further problems.  

A chronic problem with these is that they leak power steering fluid.  This can happen even with the newer ones.  You can buy a kit to fix the power steering leak at the box if the box is leaking, or it could be a line.  In our experience, when you buy a kit to fix the box, it usually runs about $500. Castrol power steering fluid seems to help with the problem as well.

The cost of repairing this vehicle is quite costly.  Especially if taken to the Land Rover dealership.  We only have our Discos diagnosed at Land Rover; we take the vehicle to a reputable mechanic for repair work at a significantly lower cost.  You must remember that an expensive vehicle will be more expensive to maintain and repair.  A Land Rover is an expensive vehicle, thus the costly maintenance and repairs.  Repair costs are relative to the cost of the vehicle.

As for safety...a few months back, a couple from out of state were driving on the interstate downtown through our city and somehow ended up going over the bridge on the highway and dropping about 50 feet into the river. They survived this without any injuries.  The vehicle?  Land Rover Discovery.

All in all, we think these are great rugged vehicles.  They ride smooth.  They are a very heavy vehicle and feel heavy, but still have the get-up-and-go that a lead-foot like me looks for in an automobile.  The seats are extremely comfortable, and driving or riding in one is like being in a moving room--they are extremely spacious inside.  We can pack drywall, lumber or a carload of friends in one and hit the road.  And of course, they are very cool.  When driving down the highway, its a neat feeling that hardly no one else has one.  If they only knew what they're missing...<br><br>
