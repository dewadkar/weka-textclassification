            I bought this camera when my baby was born. And I'm so happy I have it!! I can keep taking tons of pictures of her without thinking about the cost! 

The camera is really good. The zoom is very powerful, and the pictures are good for digital pictures. I like the fact that I don't need to think of storage, because this camera uses diskettes. So if you're going out, just toss in a few diskettes, and you're all set!

A digital camera is especially useful for me because I love making web pages. And I can send pictures immediately to my family in India.

The things I don't like are, first, digital pictures as of now do not have very good resolution -- not the fault of this camera -- so if I want to take prints out of them, the quality is not good. Of course, on the web it looks really good. The other thing is that for some reason my floppies develop errors after using a few times. So sometimes I lose my pictures. I don't know if this is a problem with this camera or not, but this is what I have faced.

Otherwise I really love this camera, and I'm very very glad I have it.<br><br>
