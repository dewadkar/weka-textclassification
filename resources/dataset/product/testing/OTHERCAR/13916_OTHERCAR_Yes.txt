            The price, color selection, option packages, construction, and drive are all huge perks for this car.  It is extremely safe on the road with its reinforced frame and airbag setup.  I found my test drive extremely satisfying, and a large improvement in the drive of my old car as far as smoothness of ride goes.  When in the Saturn, it almost feels as if I am riding on air.  Having a CD player as a basic option was another excellent perk... there are NO good radio stations where I live so having a CD player was a must. :)  Anyhow, the only complaint I had with the Saturn is the complete lack of kick.  This car red lines at 5.5(x1000)rpm!  It is extremely sluggish shifting gears between the 40-45 range and 70-75 range.  Realize that this is coming from a college student, however, who likes his cars to have some semblance of a race car ;)  Flooring this car has virtually no effect on its acceleration.  Now, with this said, I know that there are MANY who could care less how their car accelerates as long as it is safe, roomy, dependable, has good gas mileage, and gets them where they need to go.  If all this is true, the 2001 Saturn S1 is your car!  The option packages available for this car are: power lock/windows, keyless entry, safety (which includes anti-lock brakes, traction control, and side curtain airbags), upgraded speakers, and moonroof.  My car has the safety package and was leased for $212/mo with $0 down.  An excellent deal.
