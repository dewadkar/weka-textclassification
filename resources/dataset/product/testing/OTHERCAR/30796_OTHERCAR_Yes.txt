            My wife had purchased this camera for me as a birthday present and needless to say I fell in love with it right away.  The pictures I have taken so far are without a doubt far superior than those I have ever taken with a 35mm camera. Plus, on the 8MB smartcard that comes with the camera, you can take up to 120 pictures (average quality setting) before you run out of space.  It did not take long to learn how to use the different settings from the flash set up to the Zoom in and motion features, etc, etc.  Plus I love the feature of the view window in the back to see the picture you have just taken.  If you don't like the picture you can simply erase it and try again. Just don't run the viewing screen too long because this eats up your battery charge quickly. 

The software included with the camera makes editing pictures fairly easy also.  It is very easy to take a picture of the newborn baby, the family pet (or anything else), download it into your computer, fix any blemishes and then pop it into an e-mail for friends and family to see.  Certainly faster than getting film developed and mailing pictures off.  If you are thinking about getting a digital camera in the near future,  you will not be disappointed with the Olympus D-340R.<br><br>
