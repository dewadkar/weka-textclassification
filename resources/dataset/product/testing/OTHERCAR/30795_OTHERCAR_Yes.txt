            After several months of debating, I finally decided on the Olympus digital camera.  I read many other reviews on the camera and found that the majority of the people who own this camera were pleased with their purchase.  I couldn't agree more.  The camera produces beautiful images, on screen and when I print them out with my photo printer.  A lot of people say that this is a battery killer, but I disagree.  The only reason it eats so much battery life is because of the LCD screen.  If you use the camera without the screen then the battery life is excellent.  The big complaint is the included serial connection for uploading the camera images to the computer.  When you have several Megabytes of images to upload, it becomes time consuming.  Also the inclusion of a optical zoom would've been a nice feature, but for the price you get what you paid for.  Although the camera is a bit on the bulky size, its not something to stress over considering the image quality that you receive and the price that you pay for it.  The software is simple to navigate with.  Documentation is detailed and helpful.  The use of a glass lens instead of a plastic lens is certainly is a nice touch.  The camera also features burst mode where you can snap up to 10 pictures in a row by just holding down the buttons.  You get plenty of options for image quality.
