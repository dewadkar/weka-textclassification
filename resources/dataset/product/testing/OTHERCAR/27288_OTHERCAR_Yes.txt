            We were looking for a SUV, but not a monster.  The Durango fit the bill.  Big enough but not too big.  We purchased a blue 2000 SLT Durango loaded with all of the goodies, (not leather in Texas), love that stereo.  During our search I test drove several SUV's looking for the one that was just right.  The Explorer was too small and rode like a skate board.  The Yukon was nice but big and pricey, ditto for the Expedition, can hardly fit those in the garage.  Then I drove the Durango and my mind was made up.  
The ride, handling, turning, pick up and go were superior to all of the others that I test drove, and the utility was also above the others as well. The Durango is well put together and everything has a tight will built fit and sound ( door slam sound tight). The gas mileage could be better but I have managed 20 mph,with a tail wind, on the highway with the 5.2 V-8.  But I didnt buy the "D" for its good gas mileage.
I love the utility of being able to haul around 8 people then quickly change, fold the rear most seat down to haul more cargo or even more cargo with all back seats folded down.  The rear storage bin is a super idea, but Dodge could work on better cup holders.
All in all a super buy and great vehicle, plus it looks great!

1000 mile update. So far sooo good, no problems, except with the law.  This dude gets up and hauls.  I have to watch the lead foot.  Also with the lead foot you get very pooooor gas mileage.  But it sure is fun, reminds me of a camero I once had.  The stereo rocks!!!

6000 mile update. I have had the Durango for 6 months now.  Still no problems.  Still love it.  Very solid vehicle.
