            I bought a 2000 Kia Sephia January 3rd and so far I love it. I bought it because of the relatively low price and the commercials showing over 200,000 miles driven. I also liked the looks of it (I picked Pewter color both because it's really pretty and doesn't show dirt much). At still under 10,000 miles I've had none of the problems that many others apparently have had. It handles like a small car but it's tight and zippy. Anybody on a tight budget with a small family would be happy with it. It's certainly not a luxury car, but it has everything I need (air conditioning, power steering and brakes) without power windows and door locks and other fancy things I don't need. It does have a cassette stereo and I have a portable CD player with power and cassette adapters and it fits right into a slot on the dash. But it doesn't have Cruise Control, the only thing I miss. Again, so far so good, or maybe even great!<br><br>
