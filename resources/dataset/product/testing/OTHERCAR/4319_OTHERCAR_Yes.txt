            I have the 25th Anniv. edition LE...currently 178K miles...it has comfortable front seating (I use it as a daily 50 mile commuter)...rear seating a little tight(my children were small when I first bought it so it worked well for me then)...solid body, lots of features for an economy car of this vintage(pwr win/locks/mirrors, sunroof, ABS, tilt steering, CD)...no squeaks...ride is comfortable but too much road noise can be bothersome...trunk is large for a car of this size but low for easy access (lockable rear seats also fold down for easy access to trunk)...being short I really enjoyed the adjustable height driver's seat...and the ease of access for regular maintenance (oil, spark plugs, etc.) is great...
