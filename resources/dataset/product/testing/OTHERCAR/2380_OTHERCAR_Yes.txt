            A digital camera is a huge purchase for most of us, and one purchase where you don't want to go wrong.  We researched cameras for weeks, comparing features and abilities, and this is the one we bought.  We've never regretted it!  Here's what sold us:

<B>* USB Compatible *</b>  I can't stress enough how important this is.  If you have, or will one day have, USB, you have to get a camera that supports it.  We're talking mere seconds for downloads of large graphic files, instead of minutes.

<B>* Rechargeable Battery *</b>  Plug it in and juice it up.  Why throw away money on batteries?  You can even use it while it's charging.  This is a must feature; it will save you countless dollars.  Charges quickly (maybe an hour for from 0% to 100% charge).

<B>* LCD *</b>  Yes, you can live without it, but why?  See your pictures instantly, and delete the ones you don't like so you can take more.  This may use extra battery life, but take the plug in charger with you and it won't matter.  An LCD display lets you keep only the photos you want, which is important if you have limited disk space.

<B>* Zoom *</b>  You know why this is important.  What's cool is that you can also zoom in on the LCD screen and see all areas of your photo in close up.  This will show you if the photo is fuzzy or crisp, and let you see facial expressions, even in group photos.

<B>* Image Expert Software *</b>  By far the best software we've come across.  You can use the Quick Fix feature and then go in and sharpen, deepen, and add color (we like more blue in our photos).  Also, this software has a great screen saver option -- just select an album as your screen saver and you're done!  Makes it easy to update the photos, too.

<B>* Video *</b>  You can actually take videos with this camera -- no sound, but it's still fun!  The movies go up to 60 seconds.  We have captured the first time our infant batted at a toy with his foot, his funny faces while tasting new foods, and even my husband getting 2 ringers while playing horse shoes. We also got some awesome shots of lightning, and you can freeze the panes (but I haven't figured out how to turn those panes into photos, if you even can).  You do have to switch modes when recording and viewing videos, which is a little bit of a pain, but not a huge deal. 

Another nice feature -- you can turn off the sound.  This matters to us because our little guy would stop whatever he was doing when he heard the camera, and we'd miss the shot!

This is a great looking camera and it comes with lots of accessories - recharger, USB cable, strap, lens cover, and 8 meg card.  I'd definitely recommend getting at least a 32 meg card, too (about $60 when we got ours).  64 meg cards are out there or coming soon, and this is noted as being upgradeable to 128 megs by firmware, which is yet another plus.

The camera didn't come with a case and doesn't fit in most (it's 3" thick, which is too big for most cases we tried), but we found a nice ICON one that holds the camera and accessories and is still small enough that it doesn't feel like you're hauling around a video camera.

We've noticed only 2 down sides: first, in some lighting (usually soft yellow lights, like those our living room) it's hard to get clear shots.  My brother has this camera too, and says he has learned to manipulate the flash so this isn't an issue (my husband and I haven't taken the time to investigate our photography taking as much as my brother has; we just point and shoot and mostly get great pictures!).  The second thing is that the rubber guard protecting the recharger, USB and serial ports tore off after about a year.  We can still affix it to the camera but it is no longer permanently attached (this was truly the only part of the camera that could be considered flimsy, and the guard itself wasn't, just the bottom where it attached).

And the lowdown from a site that our guru brother in law has said is one of the best, when it comes to digital camera reviews:

We got this camera during a Toshiba promotion offering $100 rebate, so our bottom line was about $550.  The list is $799 but Yahoo Shopping currently shows a few stores that have it under $400!  One is listed here (I know nothing about this store, but the price is good so it might be worth investigating - the page says they don't sell any gray market or refurbished items):

We've taken thousands of photos and are extremely pleased with this camera.  I recommend it to everyone!
