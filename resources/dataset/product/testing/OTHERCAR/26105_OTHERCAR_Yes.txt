            I am so thoroughly happy with this camera, that I even sold my slr film camera!! The quality is wonderful, so crisp and clear, and it is very easy to use. It has features that many professional cameras have. For one thing, not only does it go beyond the 1200 dpi resolution with the hi-pict mode, but you can take pictures in various modes as well, even black and white if you so desire. Not only are the colors accurate, but the sharpness and quality are awesome. This is the first digital camera I have had as far as higher end and it definitely left me impressed. The camera comes not only with batteries, but a battery charger which itself is worth a lot. A nice camera case is also included.
I bought a memory card for it and now can go anywhere without worrying about running out of memory for pictures. The camera itself has 8MB storage, but that gets used up easily in Hi-Pict mode. I love everything about this camera. I really cannot think of anything wrong to tell you about. Anyone who wants a very high quality camera without forking over lots of money should consider the 750EZ<br><br>
