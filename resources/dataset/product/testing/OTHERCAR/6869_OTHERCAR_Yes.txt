            We bought our hyundai back in June 99.We havent had any car problems It
runs wonderful and is easy on gas.We bought this car because we really needed to get into a newer car. Our other car was really acting up. We have been really happy with this car. We went on several trips with the car. We did have a lack of space on one of the trips but that was our fault cause we brought too much stuff.

The only thing I dont like is now that we have two kids, most of the backseat is taken up.When we go grocery shopping the trunk cant hold all the groceries and Our sons stroller.


Its a nice car that I would recommend to a couple or a couple with one child.<br><br>
