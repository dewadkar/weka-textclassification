            The 2000 Pontiac Montana is a absolutely terrific vehicle, we had been looking at various SUVs, and a few minivans for about 2 months. The larger SUVs offered the space and flexibility we wanted, but were gas guzzlers, typically getting less than 15mpg in the city, and less than 18mpg on the highway, not to mention being very expensive. Most other minivans we had looked at measured up in the space and flexibility departments, but a few did only slightly better than the SUVs did on mileage, and the ones that did seem to meet all the requirements were close to $30,000... 
Enter the Montana, one of the best mileage performers in it's class, more than ample space for both passengers and cargo alike, a host of convenience features, and for those of us with children CUP HOLDERS EVERYWHERE !. Various seating configurations are available, and if you've got some trips to the Home Improvement store coming up, all the rear seats fold down and or come out quickly and easily.
I haven't found much that I dislike about the Montana as of yet, it is a smooth riding minivan with a sure feel on the road. 
I think the Montana is an excellent choice for automotive buyers that are looking for a reasonably priced, sporty, well powered minivan, built for a growing family. I would highly recommend a test drive if you are in the market for new automobile<br><br>
