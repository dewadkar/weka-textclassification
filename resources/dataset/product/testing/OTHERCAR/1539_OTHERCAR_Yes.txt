            We bought our '96 Saturn SL1 new as a family car. We were looking for something inexpensive but safe and reliable.  I think we found it.  We have been extremely satisfied. 
My only negative comment would be that it is relatively small.  We can easily get our family of 3 in it.  But it would be a tight fit for 4 tall adults. 
Another great thing about the Saturn is the service.  In all my years of having a car I have never had such great service from a dealer.  And I never walk away dissatisfied or feeling ripped off.  (and I must say that is a first for any type of repair or service shop!) 
I would definitely buy another vehicle from Saturn.  I hope they will come out with a Mini van sometime in the future!<br><br>
