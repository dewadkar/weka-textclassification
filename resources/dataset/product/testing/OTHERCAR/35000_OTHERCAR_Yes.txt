            She had driven all the ordinary cars that the rest of us drive to work.  She had put the long hours at her accounting firm job.  After raising her sons and seeing them getting successful in their own fields, it was time for her and her husband to start getting to the delicacies of life.  For sure, she had to start pampering herself.  And she deserves every single minute of it.  <b>Who would not say <i> go, girl!</i> to such a mother</b>!  Meet Margo (not her real name for confidentiality reasons!), the mother of one of my best friends.  I have known this family for quite some time now from church.  Two of Margo's sons are about my age.  Our love of great vehicles is at the base of our friendship.  A few weeks ago, Margo got herself a <b>2001 Lexus LX 470</b> for her birthday.  This great mother's vehicle became my tester this past week-end when George, her son, came to pick me up for an outdoor Jazz festival.  What I discovered in this Lexus greatly impressed me.

<b>Lexus Zaps the psyche of those with affinity to luxury and class</b>

<i>Lexus' short life and introduction to the American market</i>

Not too long ago, about 11 years, nobody knew that much about Lexus.  No automotive consumer identified Lexus with a brand of luxurious cars and SUVs.  Still with its status of newcomer in the automotive industry, this Japanese import is surely kicking butts and turning heads on our freeways and highways.  One look is not enough.  It often takes two long, good looks to appreciate the designing and engineering feasts that this SUV represents.  Over its relatively short period of existence, it has produced some of the most wanted vehicles that most well-off and class-conscient American consumers want to purchase. <i>No wonder the 2001 Lexus LX 470 has been this hard-working mother's quiet dream vehicle!</i>.

<b>So many staggering, important statistics:  The numbers of sold vehicles count</b>

Lexus vehicles are hot items in the US.  If you look at the number of vehicles sold in this country, you will realize that Lexus had sold 1 million cars in this country.  All of us can remember how the company started with two hot sedans:  LS 400 and ES 250.  It has also produced such high-flying sport coupes such as SC 400 and SC 300.  They got all the rave reviews from automobile journalists and reviewers. So far, Lexus has bumped the competitors so hard that it has become the number 1 selling luxury import.  It has beaten the perennial holders of this position such as Mercedes-Benz and BMW.  <i>You can now realize why, last year, the company sold 20,000 vehicles in one month!</i>

<b>Quality vehicles, sophistication, great technology, innovation and improved performance are some of the features</b>

The 2001 Lexus LX 470 can sit eight people easily.  That's great in case you have some children and grandchildren to truck to various activities.  It is also equipped with a wood/leather steering wheel, a digital compass and auto-dimming rearview mirror.  If you care about the safety of your little ones, it has the shifter-linked door locking and child restraint system.

What I love the most about the LX 470 is the fact that the driver can raise the SUV with a control switch and light that will show its current suspension height and recommend optimal leveling as the road becomes steeper or flatter.  It takes some getting used to harness all the power of this SUV, of course!  A few more things that the LX 470 comes equipped with are:

*  Intuitive Parking Assist System with sonar range finders

*  Dynamic Laser Cruise Control System

*  DVD System and a navigation screen that doubles as a movie screen.

*  And all the standard equipments  such as automatic climate control, power window, cruise control, power heated front seats etc.

This 4-door Sport Utility can give you a 13/16 miles per gallon in city/highway.  With a 4.76, 8 cylinders producing so much power and thrust, you will realize that you are not only safe but also in command of a power plant of a SUV on the road.
