            My dad worked for GM so of course I've always had Chevrolets. Well, the Cavalier RS if fantastic. I have a 91 - I've been driving it for 9 years now and with 178,000+ miles it's still going good. Little things are falling apart but with that many miles it's only a minor inconvenience. It's very dependable - chevy's always are. The car is quick and gets 30mpg. I drive it hard, I accelerate fast and stop quick. I'm hard on my brakes. I've done routine maintenance and besides for the alternator being replaced a few times nothing major has broke down.
I've been thinking it's time to change - my work takes me farther from home than before and I believe I'll get another Cavalier. I truly like it.<br><br>
