            The GMC Jimmy is a reliable suv. I have had for the most part no significant problems. Its wide wheel base helps for the feel of a safe ride and corners without fear of tipping over. The factory built in sound system is an excellent system for the basics. I have had the car from 1995 until now and there are for the most part zero squeaks. I recommend this for first time drivers due to its very small blind spots and also its obvious size factor. The acceleration for the v6 engine is surprisingly good due to its weight and size. It has maintained itself very well. Other than the basic maintenance the truck needs basically no work. I would absolutely recommend this to friends and family.<br><br>
