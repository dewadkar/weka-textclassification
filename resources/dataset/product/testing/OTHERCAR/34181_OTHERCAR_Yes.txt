            I purchased a 2000 Passat Wagon in July 2000 and have been very happy with this car.  I now have 120,000 on it and can say with confidence that this is the best car I have ever owned and that includes one Lexus LS400 that is consistanty ranked as the best car in the world.  

I Have the GLS V-6 with the 5 speed manual and think this combination gives me the best results for my needs. Economy is 27 MPG overall-not just highway- although I do a lot of highway driving.  The power is excellent and I find that the engine is so flexible that I can pull 5th gear as low as 30 MPH with out a wimper.  The car handles very accurately and has an excellent and smooth ride.  It is very quiet on all kinds of surfaces.  

The seats are all day confortable for a big guy like me at 6'3" and 230 pounds.  My daughter also has no problem getting comfortable and she is only 5'1".  

I have replaced the following parts on this car: timing belt, oil-fuel-air filters, 3 sets of tires, 2 sets of wiper blades.  Everything else is orginal including the brakes.  If its one thing I hate its going back to the "stealership" for anything but maintenance, and this car must feel the same way.  My dealership experience has been good also with them providing me a loaner when they changed the timing belt as specified at 90,000 miles.

As I stated above I have owned many cars and tend to put a lot of miles on them in my job.  To say that this is the best car I have owned puts it above the mentioned Lexus, Toyota Camery, Toyota Corolla, 2 VW Jetta's, several Chrysler's, Pontiac Grand Prix, Lincon Town Car, and a couple of others I would rather forget.
