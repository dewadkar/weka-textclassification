            I brought at 1995 Saturn SC2 and I never had ANY problems.  Last fall, a Chevy Z71 pickup truck ran a stop sign and totaled my car, hitting me on the drivers side.  I walked away without a scratch.  I looked around at different cars and SUVs, and finally decided after test driving a 2000 Saturn SC2 to get a new one (with the insurance money from the 1995 paying for over HALF of the brand new one!!!)  Even though the design has changed, both inside and out, my new 2000 drives the same way as the old one... just the way I like it!!!<br><br>
