            I purchased a 1997 Plymouth Breeze and have had it for almost 3 years.  I love the ride that the car has.  It drives like a big car even though it is only a mid-size.  The power window and door lock options are a must and the AM/FM stereo is superb.
The sporty look and feel is great especially for a family car.  I am pleased with the gas mileage that I get and use only regular unleaded.
The only thing that I dislike about the vehicle is the adjustments on the steering wheel.  It is hard to adjust it to the perfect level.  But the dash board is easy to see and the back seat is very roomy.  The trunk size is more than sufficient for a family of four to go on vacation. <br><br>
