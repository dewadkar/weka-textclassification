            I recently bought myself a Nissan Pathfinder. I based my selection on a lot of things, cargo space, size, power, and the such. The Pathfinder was the best in all of those. Sure, the price is high, quite high, but with all the stuff you get, it's worth it.
I think the best thing for me was the AC that worked. The AC in my old car was, well, bad. And living in Arizona, you need good AC.
The Pathfinder is also very stylish. It's very nice looking, unlike some other SUVs *cough* Aztek *cough*.
The engine is excellent, there is no struggle to get up to speed or anything. I would say my biggest problem is the fact that you don't feel like you're going very fast when you really are. I caught myself going 60 in a 40 MPH zone, not knowing it at all. Luckily, there's never any cops around...Anyway, I really love the awesome engine, and I do believe the Pathfinder could be excellent transportation on a road trip. The MPG is pretty good, though I'm not too fond of the Premium unleaded gas that is supposed to be put in for best performance. The Premium gasoline is 20 cents more than regular unleaded here. But, I'm not one who travels much, so it won't be too bad.
