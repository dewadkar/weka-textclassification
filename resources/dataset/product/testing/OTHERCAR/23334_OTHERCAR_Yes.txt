            Usually my summers are filled with exotic travel to hot places.  This summer took me to a hot place with an exotic car.  I expected to be picked up in my cousin's &quot;regular&quot; Jeep Cherokee, but much to my surprise, I was wisked away in her companies new 2000 Plymouth Prowler. (I was told that the car was purchased by her company as a perk for an Application Developer from Seattle who came from Microsoft and moved 3,000 miles to join her company) You have to see this car!

The car is quick, comfortable, but a tad small--luckily I was traveling light.  My cousin is a mom, however, she is quite a number when driving in this car.  I had no idea the excitement and attention I was going to receive in Baltimore.  The Prowler is sleek, smooth, and mighty quick.  Our 40 mile drive was filled with on-lookers and laughter.  Although this car may not be practical for a family, it is a perfect weekend car.  There are only a limited number made, in only three colors per year and 2001 could be the last chance to get one.  See you on the road!  <br><br>
