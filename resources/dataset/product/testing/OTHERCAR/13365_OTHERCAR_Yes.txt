            I just got my car, which is a caprice classic 9C1(Ex cop car), about one month ago. I paid 3600 for it and it had 101,000 miles on it. I got interested in these cars at first because of reports of them going over 300,000 miles without major breakdowns and if you keep them up. Well I would have to say its true, the engine in my car is in beautiful condition. Last weekend I had just torn it all apart to make sure I wasn't ripped off and just had some nice looking plastic pieces on the outside of my V-8 LT1 small block 350 Chevy engine. Many mechanics whom I *trust* have told me about these engines and how they can take a real beating and still run fine. It must be true seeing as a Texas state highway patrol officer owned this car before me. I'm sure it was beat. The engine can put about 265 horses out. The same engine is used in some model corvettes and in the Impala SS, which in essence, this car is. I've read a few different numbers but 330 ft. lbs. of torque is about the average amount of torque you get. This car is a big heavy car, weighing in about 4300 lbs. but it sure can haul. You can turn the tires over without even worrying about it from a dead stop going straight. I just put all new super sport performance tires on the car and it still squeals them if I give it some juice. I try not to drive it too hard but it is just too tempting. Usually people see the car and think "Oh big old heavy slow thing" and then they try to fly past you in a little 4 banger. Its funny to see the look on their faces as you easily pass them. It is a sleeper, although my car is still all white with the spotlight and everything a cop would have minus the flashing lights. I have yet a person to do something dangerous by me(such as cut me off). I would recommend this car for a kid because of it being big and safe with airbag and power everything and people tend not to drive too stupidly around you. The only thing is that it does have a lot of power. My car has cloth upholstry all around, but some variants have a vinyl back seat. I would assume it makes it easier to clean up prisoner's "bathroom mishaps" off of vinyl. :-). Overall though it is like having a big nice luxury car with the "balls" of a corvette. I do admit when I first got it I was a little worried if it would really be as quick as I was told, and it was. I know most of this opinion is about how fast the car is, and that basically is because I was very suprised. It's not the fastest, of course, but it is a fast car and its also comfortable. I have had to do nothing to my car except replace an O2 censor on it (caused check engine light to come on) and adjust the valve covers and roller rockers in the engine(My choice, I like to fidget with things. I would recommend not doing this, took awhile). The heavy duty suspension is very nice addition, its like riding on a fast cloud. Also the steering/handling is very tight like a sports car, but not AS tight. Its a nice mixture between luxury and sports - and no its not like a cheap ford ;-). I know a lot of my friends are looking into getting a car like mine, I had to search for about 2 years to find a good deal on the car, being in mint condition and I got it for only $3600(That is extremely good, I was about to settle for $4200). Just be careful when looking for a Caprice "9C1" because there are a few "rats" out there. Don't goto a car dealer, private people are the best, infact I got my car off eBay. At the dealer they wanted $7200 for a horrible looking caprice that only had the 350 in it, not the LT-1. All the caprices before 94 had the 350. The Ford Clown Vic was faster than those cars by about 20hp. If you were to get a Caprice, go for the LT-1 and get everything.

****UPDATE****
I have recently put AR-136 American Racing Mags on the car and a set of Ravin Cat-Back exhaust 2-1/2" with medium mufflers, it sounds awesome. I was going for the 60's muscle car sound and I got pretty close. Its a real head turner now and having the new exhaust lets my car breath a little better, you can feel a difference in the gas pedal. Soon to come when I get a little bit of money back, a custom air intake and who knows what else! My car now has about 106,000 miles on it from the time of this original report and I still love it. As I said, great car.
