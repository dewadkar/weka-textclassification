            The Lincoln Navigator has to be one of my favorite SUVs on the market.  It is SO burly--I just can't resist it!  Its like a really awesome mack truck (but of course makes an entirely different statement...)One may be wondering if I actually drive a Navigator and I must admit that my car is far inferior, but as a fan I can say that if you are thinking about buying one, you should absolutely go for it.  I'm sure they're lots of fun to drive, but more importantly: they make you look really cool and other people will be jealous of you.  If I see someone driving a Navigator I automatically wish I were them, or at least that they would pick me up for a ride.  I would say that a black or maybe silver model would be your best bet, and don't forget tinted windows and a CD changer (these optimize the jealousy of your friends and fellow drivers.)<br><br>
