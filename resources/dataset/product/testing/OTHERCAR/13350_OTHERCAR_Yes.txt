            I received this camera as a christmas gift.  It was my first digital camera and as it turns out�a perfect beginner�s model.  So simple to use, it�s like a simple point and shoot camera.  But, on the other hand, so simple to use, it does come without limitations.  

This camera features:
1) The standard Smartmedia storage card, usually a 2 or 4 mb card comes included.  This can be upgradeable to 16 mb and is a smart investment.
2) A built-in four flash mode (auto, always on or off, and red eye).  It is not very effective at distances over 8 feet.
3) A 10 second self timer.
4) Manual mode.
5) 1.5 Megapixels resolution, an excellent feature for quality printouts
6) 2x Digital Zoom feature capturing pictures in two sizes (640x480, 1280x1024), permits zoom up to 2x without distortion, yet maintains the resolution.  This is accomplished by cropping the image to only include the center and thus can not compare to the optical zoom.
7) Macro zoom, another excellent feature that allows focusing of objects that are only about three and a half inches away�great for taking photos of small objects.
8) Bright LCD screen, can be turned on or off.  If kept on, your batteries will die very fast.
9) Cables to connect to T.V. for viewing
10) Serial cables to transfer images to computer.  This method is very slow.  There are other options to transfer images, such as a floppy disk, but this must  be purchased separately.
11) Uses AA batteries, both a positive and negative attribute.  This camera goes through batteries very quickly.  Although you may use an adapter to plug into an outlet, it has to be purchased separately.  Fortunately though, these are only AA batteries, and the cost of replacement is much less than that of a Lithium battery.
