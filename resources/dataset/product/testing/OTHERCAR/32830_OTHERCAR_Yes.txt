            I bought my Cavalier new in 1995, as a single mom with a newborn baby boy.  I was very interested in its low price, since I was a single mom, and its dependability -- didn't want to break down with a tiny baby!  The car has been great.  I bought it in June of 95 and it has 100,000 miles on it now.  I have had no major problems with the car, minor maintenance type work (such as brakes).

It's sporty look makes the car stylish as well as affordable.  There is nothing I hate about the car.  It has excellent acceleration and handles great.  <br><br>
