            This was our first ever new car.  We got it for my wife in Feb. of 1999.  She commutes to work every day and it now has about 40,000 miles on it.  When we first got it, it was a head turner like no other.  We could go for days or even a week without seeing one on the road.  Not so anymore.  <b> After my experiences with a 1996 diesel (TDI) VW Passat, I knew this would be another great car.  The TDI engine even sounds more like the older beetles.<b>
My wife gets around 50 mpg and the engine has been absolutely perfect and free of any kind of problem.  When you set cruise at 75 mph and you head up a steep mountain pass, the 1.9L engine will pass V6 powered Camry's like they are sitting still.<b>

Maintaining the car has not been all pleasant, however.  We have had our trunk release and fuel door cables adjusted about five times since new.  We paid over $500 to add the center arm-rest which is a lot for a bunch of molded plastic.  We paid over $500 to have the small driving light lens replaced after a rock hit it on the interstate; it turns out that in order to replace the lens, you have to remove the front bumper!  All beetles share in door lock switches that go bad ( our dealer wants $392 to replace it even though we've had the door apart three times already).  The service manager told me that over 60% of those switches fail but only in the Beetle. Virtually all the switches on the driver's side door have been replaced at different times at wth some expense.<b>

My old Passat never had a problems (after 297,000 mi) but it was actually made in Germany as is my new TDI Jetta Wagon that I love.  It may be that the imports from Mexico are the problem, I don't know.<b>

In any case, even with the shortfalls and expense of caring for our beetle, my wife will have nothing else.  The fuel economy of our TDI's easily make up for these kinds of bothersome and often expensive repairs.  We have a total of five friends that have invested in TDI's from VW after hearing us rave about them.  They are simply fantastic cars.
