            I first purchased my c30 back in 98, i was really excited about all the hype i heard about digital camera's. So i went and bought one. At the time i was using a KTX 400mhz. pc. i could not belive how easy it was to install and operate the photo finishing software. As soon as i installed all the drivers and connected the port's. I went out and took pictures. When i downloaded the picture's i could not believe the quality of the image it produced. And when i print picture's from pc to my HP ink jet 812 printer loaded with photo paper. Once again, the results were astounding. Depending on the resolution, you can save up to 40 images on an 8mb flashcard.
Also if you don't have a computer, you could connect it to you're vcr and save you're picture's to video tape. Imagine that, no more photo albums to deal with or have to buy. Imagine how many images you can save to a 6hr video tape. Now it uses four aa baterries that actually come included when you first purchase the camera. I think HPc30 is the best money can buy when you are gettng you're feet wet in the digital age.
I recomend this for the novice at art in photography.<br><br>
