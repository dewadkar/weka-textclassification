            I am proud to declare my epinion of the 2000 Nissan Xterra XE that has been tested thoroughly by our family now for the past 3 months.  We purchased the Xterra last year, trading in our trusty 1993 Ford Explorer XLT.  We were looking for a vehicle with a smoother ride and more capable and comfortable on and off-road handling.  Additionally, we sought a vehicle that would be reliable, durable, and safe.  After much research on Epinions.com, in industry and consumer publications, and test driving, we concluded that the Xterra fit the bill in every aspect.  Here's why:

<B>1. RIDE AND HANDLING</B>
Granted, compared to a 1993 Explorer, the ride in a new dump truck may be more comfortable.  However, after test driving other SUV's (namely a 2000 Pathfinder, 2000 4Runner, 2000 Explorer, and 2000 Lexus RX300), the Xterra's ride was definitely impressive.  While not as plush or luxury-car like as the aforementioned competitors, the slightly firmer but very responsive and comfortable ride characteristics of the Xterra are definitely above average for a smaller SUV - and the cost is significantly less than those vehicles as well.  The suspension soaks up your average pothole, speedbump, trail rut, washboard surface, etc. with only slight jarring to the interior cabin.  Off road the suspension travel is impressive and fits with the vehicle's true intended disposition and utilitarian purpose.  Handling off and on road likewise reflects the vehicle's utilitarian nature.  In an urban environment, the Xterra's handling is very civilized - parallel parking is a breeze, and the vehicle handles extremely well in traffic.  On the freeway, it's pretty typical SUV - I did notice that because of it's taller profile it tends to catch crosswinds like a sail at times, but the firm but responsive steering conveys a great deal of confidence to the driver.  Even in adverse conditions (snow, mud, rain, ice), the Xterra never missed a step and is predictable and manageable on all accounts.  All in all, a very athletic but civilized performer as far as ride and handling.

<B>2.  RELIABILITY AND SAFETY</B>
With our Explorer, we had come to enjoy a great deal of satisfaction with the reliability of the vehicle and wanted something as (if not more) reliable.  Nissan has an impeccable (and in my opinion underrated) record for reliability in its trucks.  The Xterra so far has been no exception.  I once had the pleasure of driving a Nissan Patrol while abroad, and the Xterra imparted a similar feel of durability and toughness.  The truck is not flimsy in any regard, unlike others in its class.  It is definitely built solid - take one look at the frame and you'll see that this is no urban SUV wanna-be!  Fit and finish inside and out are exceptional.  We have had no mechanical problems with the vehicle to date, and with proper maintenance, should have very few in the future.  In the safety arena, the Xterra has standard dual airbags.  The size of the vehicle also attributes a higher level of safety to its occupants in the event of an accident - a high stance (even higher for those seated in the rear seat) and side impact door beams provide an excellent shell of protection around driver and passengers.  In fact, the Xterra has been very highly rated by the IIHS and various insurance companies for its exceptional safety design and crash test results.

<B>3.  CREATURE COMFORTS AND OTHER COOL FEATURES</B>
The Xterra was definitely borne of and marketed to an active lifestyle.  Nissan really hit the mark when designing a vehicle that people can actually USE as a sport and utility vehicle.  Most other so-called SUV's on the market tout themselves as being able to support an active, outdoor lifestyle, but often fall short of that mark in many respects.  In the Xterra, there's everything you need and nothing you don't.  Leather seats are not an option (should they be, in a real SUV?).  The closest you get to luxury seating in the Xterra are the optional neoprene seat covers.  There are storage nooks and crannies everywhere, from a map pocket on the side of the passenger's seat to storage wells in the cargo area and in the doors.  There are also 10 lash points in the interior cabin to which you can bind, bungee, or strap down pretty much anything that will fit.  Near each passenger entry/exit is a handle to make entry and egress from the vehicle quite easy, despite the higher step-in height (alleviated somewhat by the optional step bars).  There are 3 12V power points in the vehicle as well (2 in the dash, one in the rear cargo area).  Very nice.  The roof rack has a mesh basket in which wet items can be carried and subsequently blow-dried in transit.  The roof rack itself is beefy aluminum tubes which accept a variety of aftermarket or optional attachment devices for canoes, kayaks, bikes, skis, you name it.  A rather neat design is also found in the stadium-style seating of the rear seat.  Good visibility for rear seat passengers!  And as far as roominess, we did sacrifice some going from the Explorer to the Xterra.  We have a 4 month old daughter, so the car seat takes up noticeably more passenger hip room on the rear seat than it did in the Explorer, but it's still not uncomfortable.  Cargo area is again decreased from what we were used to, but is still more than adequeate.  A couple of Labrador retrievers plus gear easily fit for a weekend away.

<B>CONCLUSION</B>

All in all, we are completely satisfied, if not thrilled about our Xterra.  We've already logged almost 38k miles on it already, and it's never missed a beat!  I am thoroughly impressed with this vehicle and no doubt it will be part of our family for years to come!

<B>UPDATE - 60,000 MILES, ONE MORE KID, AND A DOG</B>

Well, we've chalked up almost 60k miles on the X's odometer and in that time we've also had another child!  Now there are TWO car seats in the back, and I can say that passenger room is definitely fully consumed at this point.  With a rear-facing seat (the convertible kind - rear/front facing; these are generally quite large) in one of the outboard positions on the rear bench, either the driver or passenger loses virtually all of their recline ability in the front seat.  Guess who that would be (me).  Sacrifices...  Anyway, comfort still rates highly, and after the seats are both forward facing, I don't think it will be a big problem.  It is actually a lot easier to seat and unseat the kids from their car seats in the outboard positions due to the height of the vehicle and the rear seat.  Mechanically, the X is as sound as it was when new.  There are a few rattles that have cropped up, but I've found the possible sources for these on the Xterra Owners Club website.  The driver's side power window is acting up also, but I think this to be a loose connection.  We've added 31x10.50 mud terrain tires and have noted a very slight noise increase but also better traction in all conditions, especially off-road or in mud/snow.  60k maintenance will be done soon and I'm sure we'll be happy taking the X across the country this summer!
