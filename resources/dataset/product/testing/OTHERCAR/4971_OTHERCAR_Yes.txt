            I was in the market for a new car to replace my 1995 Eagle Summit.  When I was driving home from work and saw this car that really caught my eye.  I had to catch up with the car to see what it was.  When I caught up to it and saw it was a Hyundai I couldn't believe it.  It was so sleek and luxurious, I had to find out more.  I went to the website to see how much they cost and saw 23900.  Now I was really intrigued.  I went to the local dealer and test drove one.  I fell in love.  Roomy, quiet, and great handling.  I felt like I was driving a Lincoln or Lexus.  So I bought one.

I love my car. It handles wonderfully, looks good, is very safe (4 air bags) & has lots of toys. My car has 15600 miles on it and I have only had it to the shop for regular maintenance (oil changes and 15k mile service) I did however make 2 appointments because of the check engine light coming on, but both times this was because of the gas cap not being seated properly. This has to do with the emissions on this car. 

There are only 2 models of this car. There is the XG300 and the XG300L. 

The XG 300: 
3.5-Liter, 194 Hp. DOHC V6 
5-Speed SHIFTRONICï¿½ Automatic Transmission 
Fully Independent Suspension 
Front and Rear Stabilizer Bars 
Dual Front and Side Airbags 
Front Seat Belt Pretensioners w/ Force Limiters 
Leather Seats w/ Power Front Seats 
ABS w/Traction Control System 
Automatic Air Conditioning 
Trip Computer 
Power Windows and Locks 
Automatic Headlight System 
16" Aluminum Alloy Wheels 
Cruise Control 
6-Speaker Premium AM/FM / Cassette / CD Audio System 
Keyless Entry With Alarm 
60/40 Split-Folding Rear Seats 
18.5 Gal. Fuel Tank 

And the XG300L adds: 

Power Glass Moonroof 
Heated Front Seats 
Two Position Memory Driver's Seat and Outside Mirrors 
Leather and Wood-tone Trim Steering Wheel 
Electrochromatic Rearview Mirror 
Rear Reading Lights 

Not bad options for a car that bases at $23,999.00 for the XG300 and $25,999.00 for the XG300L. The only option for both of these models is an eight disc changer. The cars gas mileage is 18 city/26 highway. 

WHEN DRIVING THE CAR. 

When I drive this car I feel like I am driving a $40,000.00 car. I feel smart because of the price I spent on this car. And I feel proud to drive a Hyundai. 

The car handles very well for a larger car and the shiftronic gives it a sporty appeal. All of the features are well laid out and within easy reach. It is a fun car to drive. 

The car has traction control and ABS which help out in the winter since I am in Rochester NY. 

The seats are extremely comfortable and stay comfortable through long drives. The drivers seat also raises up which is great for me since I am only 5'2". And they both have lumbar support. 

So what are you waiting for. Get to your local Hyundai dealer and test drive one. You will be glad you did!!!
