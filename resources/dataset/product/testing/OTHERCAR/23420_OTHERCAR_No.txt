            While I write this, I am trying to remember the Old Cutlass that my father had.  All I can recall is that it was Forest Green, and that the seats go to be about 150 degrees in the sun.  Other than that, it was not all that memorable. 

This car is different from that image, and I have to admit that I enjoyed the test drive.  While the exterior is not retro or new age (it seems that most new cars fit into one or the other category), it is pleasing and sufficiently different to be noticed on the road.  The interior of the GLS that we drove was nice, with comfortable leather seats, and all the trimmings.  Power, acceleration, and handling were good, but not great compared to other cars we drove (Concorde, Impala, and Outback).  

I guess one should look at the fact that the Olds nameplate represents the more luxurious side of GM, and not necessarily the performance/cutting-edge style side.

Since this was to be my wife's car, she did the majority of the driving, while i hung out in the back with the kid.  She liked the seats, which are very comfy, but was disappointed in the steering (she seemed to think it was a little to loose).  The roominess was less than we expected (you need to move to the Aurora to get the room $$$)

Compared to the Impala and the Concorde, there was just not enough luxury to make up for the smaller interior and the less-than-sterling performance.  While this is a nice car, and I would enjoy one, I don't think that you get the best bang for you buck with this one.  <br><br>
