            I own a Audi 1999-1/2 A4 and a 1988-1/2 Samurai JX.  I drive my Samurai more.  It is a Suzuki Samurai though, do not expect a Cadillac ride and enormous space inside.  I have put about 5 times what I paid for my Samurai into upgrades and modifications and now the only stock parts left are the dashboard, frame and sheetmetal.  

Great 4 x 4 for offroading.  Too light for the snow and rain - slides too much.  Great for parking in NYC.

A fun, practical, small and nimble 4 x 4.  This is no Jeep Cherokee or Wrangler (thank goodness).  Definitely not for everyone - but each Samurai owner is a Zuk fanatic in their own way.<br><br>
