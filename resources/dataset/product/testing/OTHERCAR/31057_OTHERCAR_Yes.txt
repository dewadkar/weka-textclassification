            I live outside of Honolulu. My kids attend school on the other end of town. Not only are there the usual drop offs and pick ups, but then there are the extracurricular activities. This means extra trips into town, often during rush hour. I wanted a car that would handle well in stop and go traffic, be very thrifty, and be able to haul my ever larger kids.

The 2003 ECHO is Toyota's current attempt at a cheap car. The company made previous attempts with the Tercel. While the Tercel wasn't bad, the ECHO is in another league. The ride is slightly better, less nervous, more sure of itself in corners. The engine is the same size as the Tercel's but considerably more refined and powerful. Early Tercels used a 1.5 liter engine with a carburetor, developing 60-65 horse power. Later models increased the number of valves to 12, and the horse power to the upper 80s. The ECHO features fuel injection and 16 valves with computer assisted variable timing. The new engine delivers 108 horse power, and it delivers its power over a broader range of RPM. In practice, this means the car is fast off the mark, and passes with a surprising degree of confidence in the automatic transmission's overdrive gear. The ECHO's gas milage is similar to the Tercel's, in the mid to upper 30s.

The car is light weight, making it more responsive to the gas pedal, and to Hawaii's trade winds. The ECHO stands tall. While this adds more sail area to cross winds, it helps with the car's overall comfort. People sit high. You can actually see over the roofs of Civics and Camrys. The high seats (for a car) aid ingress and egress. Thigh support is a bit lacking, but back support is superb.

The back seat is a revelation. Again, people sit high up (no more knees in one's chin). Leg room is decent (actually, it's amazing for such a small car), and your toes fit nicely under the front seats. While there are three seat belts, only the outboard seats have head rests. Three adults back there would be cramped. Two are quite comfortable. My kids don't remember our old Tercel very well, but they know our 1997 Saturn SW2. Their first comment about the ECHO concerned their amazement over the back seat. They complained about the Saturn's lack of leg room, and the back seat's funny contours. The ECHO, a much smaller car, has a much better back seat. The back seat is good enough to allow the ECHO to function as the family car.

The car interior is supposed to be funky. It's got that center mounted instrument panel. There's that cute, small steering wheel, and the storage bins everywhere one looks: Under the steering wheel, on either side of the radio, by the parking brake, in the doors, behind the front seats. Let's not forget the two glove boxes (upper and lower) while we're at it, the three cup holders, or the drawer under the passenger, front seat. The interior is a study in hard plastic, in my car's case, in several shades of gray. The ECHO is one of the few cars that looks funky and boring simultaneously.

Toyota tried to make a $10,000 car, but good luck paying that. The $10,000 comes before local taxes and fees. It also doesn't buy you much. You get two doors, a manual transmission, and steering that uses you for its power. My car came with 4 doors, an automatic transmission, air conditioning, a split rear bench, "improved" instrumentation, a CD player with improved speakers, central locking, and power steering. Missing are any kind of remote mirror adjustment, power windows, rear window defogger, cruise control, or ABS. Mine cost $14,000. That's a far cry from $10,000, but not too bad. Just remember that it's easy to drive the cost of the car up.

Now for a few comments on basic functionality. I have already mentioned the peppy engine, so I will go to the tires. One option Toyota offers is larger tires on larger rims. Other reviews speak of the smaller tires' propensity to squeal. I think Toyota changed the tires it uses. The Bridgestone Potenzas corner very well without squealing. I have fun slinging this car into curves, even if my kids don't. On the freeway, wind noise is fairly low. Engine noise is low pitched, and tire noise on rough patches is somewhat pronounced. Rough patches also cause a mild buzzing in all four doors. While the ride is hardly serene, it is very good for such a small car. Its ride is far less nervous than the Honda Civic's.

The instrumentation is simple and functional. Some people complain about the lack of a tachometer. I don't think it's needed. Pay for the instrumentation package that includes the tachometer, and you will see your speedometer shrink, and become harder to read.

There are no arm rests. Yes, there are things that look like arm rest molded into the door, but they are too short for one's forearms. The trunk opening extends down to the bumper, but stops 6-8 inches shy of the trunk's floor. The trunk is quite roomy and fully carpeted. The trunk lid pivot arms might crush tall items when the trunk is closed. The optional 60/40 split rear seat allows the storage of large items. Both the seat release knobs and the remote trunk release can be disabled.

I'll finish with the improved sound system. You get it either with the radio/CD player, or with the combination unit that adds a cassette player to the mix. You get six speakers: Two little ones for the dash, two bigger ones for the front door, and a pair of 6x9s for the rear shelf. The result is a remarkably smooth overall frequency response, and adequate bass. The controls are a combination of sensible knobs, and large push buttons. I wish all car stereos were like this. Just the thing for sitting in rush hour traffic.
