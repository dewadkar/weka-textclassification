            I'm not a computer pro, but I'd been drooling over the new digital cameras since they first came on the market, long before I had a computer.  I loved photography and took classes for it both in high school and college.  The power of editing your own photographs appealed to me more than trying to write it out on an envelope at K-mart.  But the realitie$ of owning my own darkroom made me endure.

Then a friend stopped by to show off his latest toy.  The Polaroid PDC640.  Within minutes of taking it out of the box, he was taking pictures.  I was pretty envious until he told me he got it for $200.00.  Well, $200.00 is a very affordable price.  Most cameras I'd been drooling over were $500-$700 range and on up from there.  Next payday, I had my digital camera in hand.

It is remarkable light and easy to use.  With the view screen on the back, you can examine thumbnails of your pictures and delete the really bad ones or lock the picture in so it cannot be deleted by accident.  It is so easy to use and my genetic coding made me toss the instructions away.

Working on batteries or a powercord that attaches to any outlet, you can take a variety of shots.  There is a built in &quot;smart&quot; flash (you can turn the flash on and off yourself or the camera will judge if a flash is needed).  The rear view finder allows you to take pictures without looking through the view lens.

And there is one little perk that most people won't mention.  I got the camera primarly to take pictures of my God-daughter's new baby.  After a few shots of the baby being held by everyone in the Labor and Delivery room, he was taken to the nursery.  My God-daughter's husband was allowed inside to take pictures but was afraid to use my camera.  Though it was against the rules, the nurse on duty volunteerer to take pictures for me (only birth parents are allowed in the nursery).  It took a minute to explain how to work the camera and she came back with 5 of the best shots we had of the new baby.  She adjusted the lights and positioned him for me and even got that one nude picture that his mother begged me for, because one day, he'll be sixteen.

This is an easy system and the Software included will allow you to edit and manipulate photograps.  I printed over 50 pages of pictures for the family and had then back at the hospital the next day.  Far faster than the hospital photography could deliver.  But I'm not the professional.<br><br>
