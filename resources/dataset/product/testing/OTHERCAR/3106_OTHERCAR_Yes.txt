               I really needed a reliable car.  That is Why I purchased my 2000 Elantra.   I have been driving it for about 5 months, 6,6oo miles, and I haven't had a single problem with it.  The only inconveniece I have had with it was going in for a recall.  There was something that needed to be fixed in the engine.  I have not noticed any real change in the car since the the recall.  The engine excellerates smoothly.  It gets good mileage on the interstate and it rides very smooth once the engine is set on cruise control.  For the price this car has a satisfactory amount of power.  However the engine does have a tendency to want to decrease the rpms a little bit faster than I like when I ease up on the gas.  I think that the car handles well for its size.  I haven't had any problems with it hydroplaning in rain.  Its breaks are quite responsive.  I think that the steering is good.  I have talked to other Hyundai owners and they tell me that their vehicles are still running well.  I would imagine that any company that gives you a 5 year, 50,000 mile warrantee is producing a quality vehicle.  

   The inside of the car is simple but nice.  I find the seats to be comfortable.  The radio, tape player that is standard with the car is easy to use and easy to reach.  The speakers are decent.  They have a slightly above average volume, but they get a little bit of static when they are played at a high volume.  The heater and air condition units work well.  The heater does not seem to take any power away from the engine.  The air condition does take some power away from the engine, but nothing substantial.  The steering wheel is easy to adjust.  I haven't had any problems with the power windows and locks, which I believe are standard with this vehicle.  Overall I think that it is a comfortable ride.  The only thing that I don't like about the inside of the car is the angle of the seat.  It makes me feel like I am laying down instead of sitting at the wheel.

   I think that this car is a good buy.  It is a fun and reliable car to drive.  This car has a sporty look to it.  It comes with a wonderful, practically unbeatable warrantee.  All in all it really is quite a bit of car for your buck.  If you are looking for a reasonably priced car with most of the options, and a fair amount of power, I would recommend this vehicle.  I would like to emphasize that if there are more than one of these cars to choose from at your dealer, drive all of them.  I found that the first Elantra I drove did not seem to have as much power, or shift gears as smoothly as the one I ended up buying.  Although the dealer insured me that was not possible and that I was imagining things, I would beg to differ.    <br><br>
