            We have really enjoyed everything about our new Civic!  We purchased the 2001 Civic EX six months ago.  The EX came with the VTEC motor, power moon roof, CD player, and keyless entry along with all of the standard features.  The interior is really nice and the styling is great.  The paint job seems to be a quality one and has a smooth finish.  We have has some small scratches and abrasions that rubbed right off that would have left marks on our other vehicle (not a Honda).

The acceleration is good and the ride is very smooth and remarkably quiet.  We have taken some long road trips and the car is very comfortable.  It has a responsive feel to it that I really like.  It doesn�t float all over the road, but grabs it and begs to be driven fast!  I�ve owned a 1992 Civic that I was very happy with, but this one feels like they have made some major improvements in the handling.

The sound system is a four-speaker setup that included an in-dash CD player.  This might be the one area that could use some improvement.  The sound is not great to begin with, but there is also a problem with the CD player that makes it lose its memory.  The player is coded for extra theft protection and does not work if removed from the car.  The problem is that the code goes out during normal play about twice a month.  They have told us numerous times that they are working on a fix, but we still haven�t seen a new radio.  That is the only complaint I have at all about the car.  Besides that, the car has had no problems and I would recommend it highly!
