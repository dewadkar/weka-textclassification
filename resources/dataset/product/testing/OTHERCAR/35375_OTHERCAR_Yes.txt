            I love my 1992 Acura Integra so much.

You know this because I take it for granted. This car just runs and runs and runs...and runs.

It's pretty much all I could ever ask for in a car. It holds a LOT of stuff when you wanna pretend it's a pickup truck. It looks cool when you wanna impress. It has all of the accoutrements that you need to make driving a pleasant experience and it's got the power when you just need to get around this guy in your lane going slow!

I just religiously change the oil ever 3,000 miles and replace thingies that need replacing when they are due to be replaced...and that's that! Really!

The only comments I would make to the car's designers would be to rethink where they put the speakers in the back; it seems that if you open the back hatch and the car is wet or it's raining, water gets right into the speakers! Eek!
