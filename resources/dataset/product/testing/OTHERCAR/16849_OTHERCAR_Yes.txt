            ...because it just may be worth something to an antique shop in a few years. Digital Cameras have ARRIVED.

  My parents have literally an entire room devoted to holding their thousands of photo albums.  These photo albums contain hundreds of thousands of old decaying photos that they will most likely never look at again.  Besides the fact that it is nearly impossible to find the photo you want it is always a little dangerous to flip through the pages because they are always falling apart.  In addition, the pictures themselves are not holding up well. 
 
  Every single weakness  of paper photos that has likely become obvious to anyone who owns a significant number of conventional photos can be eliminated by using a digital camera instead.  A digital camera can store an infinite number of photos in the space the size of a traditional photo album.  These digital photos can then be organized and indexed to be readily available at the touch of a button.  They will never age.  They can be copied over and over with no loss of resolution.
 
  In contrast to my parent's room of photos, I have a single cd case which holds every photo I have ever taken.  (I obviously had to go back and scan a good number of photos that I had taken before I got my digital camera)  

  When it came time to decide on which camera was right for me I made an early decision to choose a Sony.  I have always been a firm believer in Sony and feel that it is usually a good bet that their product is at least as good as any other on the market.  They are usually the most durable and dependable, as well as being generally the most user friendly.
  With that decision firmly behind me I researched two moderately priced models, the MVC-FD90, and the MVC-FD85.  

  The MVC-FD90 is a little more expensive, with an $900 price tag as opposed to the $800 asking price for the MVC-FD85.  Thus, the two cameras can be considered relatively the same, with the MVC-FD90 possessing just a couple of added perks.  The question that must be answered by each individual customer is, are these extra perks worth the money.  For me, the final answer was, YES.  

  Both cameras come equipped with goodies such as resizing, cropping and zooming post-editing features, as well as auto formats which allow for sending as email and printing for traditional photo albums.  The two aspects of the MVC-FD90 which were definitely worth the extra $100 were the increased zoom (twice as powerful) and the manual focus.  These two tools allow for even more spectacular photographs and can make even the most staunch traditional photographer forget about his EOS REBEL.<br><br>
