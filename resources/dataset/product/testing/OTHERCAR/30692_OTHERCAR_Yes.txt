<TEXT>
            <I>This past summer, with my newly obtained license in my hand, I went out looking for my first car.  Of course, since I am only a senior in high school my budget is not that big.  I started looking at the used cars and was ready to buy a cavalier but the car sold the day I went to look at it again.  At the time I was really upset.  I had fallen in love with the cavalier and had already told some friends about it.  

About a week later I went out and started looking for another car.  I went to my local dealer and there was one particular car that caught my eye - the 2000 Pontiac Sunfire.  The model I looked at was indigo blue with the chrome wheel covers - It looked great.  I eventually would go back to the car dealer many more times looking the car over.  I learned a lot about the car and noticed that it had everything that I wanted...except for the monsoon radio.  Luckily there was 1 car left, that had everything that I wanted, in the state I live in and I bought it.  I can honestly say that that was the best purchase I have ever made in my life</I>

<B>Overall Look</B>
The overall look of the Sunfire is a very sporty look.  The spoiler on the back is a really nice touch.  Depending on which package you buy, there is also an option of a sunroof.  This really adds to the sporty look.  Another option that can be added is the chrome wheel covers.  This really looks great against the indigo blue of my car.  If you want a car just for looks this one would be a great choice.

<B>Roominess</B>
A very important aspect of any car is how much room there is.  This may be the area where the Sunfire falls short.  The backseat of the Sunfire is extremely small and it is hard to get into.  I have the two door model and have had friends complain about the leg room in the back.  This is especially a problem since I am 6'2 and have to have my seat all the way back.  

As for the roominess in the front it is pretty good.  If you are under 6'2 then you will have no problem.  Anyone over that may be uncomfortable or may have trouble seeing correctly.  This car seems to not have been built for tall people.  If you are over six foot I would really advise test driving the car before you buy it.

The trunk and glove box room in this car is another story though.  The glove box is big enough to hold a six pack of pop and you should have no problem fitting in anything that you want to put in it.  Unless of course, it would be a twelve pack.  In that case you would have to use the trunk.  As far as the trunk goes it is extremely big for this size of a car.  I have had no problem putting in anything that I have to.  It is especially good for hauling around groceries.

<B>Comfort</B>
The front seats in the 2000 Sunfire are extremely comfortable.  You should have no problems riding around on family trips.  So far I have never had any soreness while sitting in the front seat of the car.

As far as the backseat goes, the leg room is a big problem in terms of comfort.  As I already stated, there is barely any leg room - especially when the seats in the front are as far back as they will go - in the back seat.  This is really a problem when traveling along for more than half an hour.  My car is the two door coupe version and maybe the sedan has better seats.  As far as the two door coupe, though, you will definately notice the lack of comfort in the back seat.

<B>Gas Mileage</B>
Another great thing about this car is the great gas mileage you will get.  The gas tank is about 15 gallons and costs (right now) about twenty dollars to fill it up.  Once it is filled you should be able to go about a week until you have to fill it up again.  I have noticed that I get about 18-22 mpg in the city and 27-35 on the highway.

<B>The Radio</B>
A very important thing to a high school kid buying his first car is the radio it has.  Of course, I was no exception as the radio was one of the key selling points for me with this car.  I chose to have the monsoon radio (the highest option) and have received many compliments on it.  The peak wattage (400) is far better than acceptable.  The added CD player is a great feature.  Whether you are looking for mirror-thumping (that would be me) base or delicate sound you will be more than happy with the monsoon radio.

Even though I have not tried out the standard radio on the sunfire I have heard that is also really good.  If you know what a Cavalier's radio sounds like you could have a pretty good idea of the Sunfire's standard radio.  I do not believe that the CD player is standard but every model that I saw had one included. 

<B>Standard Features</B>
A key thing about a car is what features it has.  The standard features on the 2000 Sunfire will not let you down.  They have just about everything included that anyone would want.  What is not included is available in the optional packages they offer.  Here are some of the standard features that this car includes:

-Air conditioning
-5 Speed Manual Transmission
-Rear Window Defogger
-Dual breakaway rearview mirrors
-Rear Spoiler
-Gauge cluster including tachometer
-Dual Front Air Bags
-4 Wheel ABS breaks
-Daytime Running lamps
-Passlock theft-deterrent system

I tried to list a lot of the more popular features but if you would like a full list I would recommend checking out the Pontiac.com homepage.

<B>Optional Features</B>
I already have mentioned some of my favorite options: the sunroof, chrome wheel covers, and the monsoon radio.  All of these greatly add to the overall look and feel of the car and I would recommend them to anyone.  Of course, everyone is different.  For this reason I will list the rest of the options.  Hopefully you will find what you are looking for.

-Power Steering
-Keyless Entry
-Power Windows
-Power Locks
-Cruise control
-CD player
-Alloy Wheels
-Power Mirrors
-Automatic Transmission
-ETS (electronic traction control)

Of course, there are even more options available.  Again, I would have to direct you to the Pontiac.com homepage as this is the most likely place where you will find out the information that you need to know.

<B>Handling</B>
The handling of the 2000 Pontiac Sunfire is excellent.  I have only had my license for a year and even I have no problem handling the car.  The Electronic Traction system is a nice added feature.  I live in Michigan and the winters can be pretty rough.  Especially this year when we have had a record amount of snowfall for December.  Being my first car and my first winter driving I cannot comment on this aspect of the handling as good as some other people may be able to.  All I can say is that I have not been in an accident yet, or even in the ditch.  This car, in my opinion, handles great.  There have been few times when I have lost control but always seem to get it back in a second.   I would recommend this car to anyone for all-season driving.

<B>Conclusion</B>
This car is one of the best cars that money can buy.   For roughly $16000-$17000 you can get a car that will handle great in both winter and summer.  The look and feel of this car will impress many people.  It is a great feeling when you see someone turn and look at your car when you are driving.  All of the options also add to the value of this car.  Whether you are a student or a family looking for a �hipper� look I would recommend checking out the 2000 Sunfire.  It is definitely worth the money.  If you have any more questions about this car, don�t hesitate to email me at:  Charliebatchfan@aol.com.
