            I bought my 1995 Dodge Dakota 5 years ago. It has been the best automobile I have ever owned.  I bought it, for the simple fact of being a small pick-up, but got a lot more.  I have a five speed, V-6 Magnum.  I get 25 to 30 miles per gallon in the city, and 40 to 45 miles per gallon on the highways and interstates.  As of right now, I have put 60,000+ miles on it, and not as much as a rattle has been heard. The oil is changed regularly, but that is not all that makes a good truck. It is quiet; the muffler has none to very little noise. It has a very smooth ride, over bumps and railroad tracks. I have no problem hauling my 18 foot bass boat, nor do I have problems getting it out of the water {the V-6 Magnum is a powerful little engine}.Every man needs one of these little trucks, just to pull their big trucks out of trouble!<br><br>
