            I Purchased a used 1998 Pontiac Sunfire SE convertible via eBay earlier this year.  During the 1998 model year, the convertible version of the Sunfire was only produced in the SE version (in subsequent 1999 and 2000 years, a GT version was also available; the primary difference in the GT was a more aggressive looking front bumper).

Even though the car came with over 41,000 miles it was extremely clean and runs well.  The 2.4 liter DOHC has plenty of pep, and the car handles tightly.  Unlike many other small convertibles, there's actually enough room in the backseat for real passengers, and the muscular styling at the rear conveniently results in a reasonably large trunk for a small car (I've taken my family of four on long trips in this car, and all our luggage readily fit in the trunk).

The 1998 Sunfire convertible came with many upscale touches, like a power convertible roof and a glass (not plastic) rear window with a defroster, things you historically didn't find below the Saab/Mercedes category of convertibles (I still see plenty of $40,000 ragtops locally with plastic rear windows).

Another big plus for this car is the styling.  The body of the 1995-2000 series Sunfire convertibles is a nice mix of sporty curves with common sense layout.  The interior is comfortable while still looking aggressive, with nice deep buckets in the front and a well laid out rear bench.  If you can get one of these with the optional sports package, there are also lots of nice leather touches up front (steering wheel, shift boot, etc.) 

My car came with the top end CD/Radio 6 speaker system, which sounded pretty good for a factory system.  Since I'm nit-picky about sound, I ended up replacing the head unit and speakers, but I'm sure the OEM system would be fine for most people.  

Negatives?  Only a few small ones. Like all convertibles, the Sunfire weighs about 300 pounds more than the generic sedan or coupe version of the car, because Pontiac adds additional structural steel stiffening to the bottom to make up for the lack of a fixed roof (which is needed to keep the frame stiff; older convertibles -- ergo, pre mid 1970s, before stiffening became common in design -- are notorious for flexing like crazy on bumpy roads).  I can tell that over the years, some piece of stiffening in my car has come loose somewhere, because I get a little rattle "down there" every once in a while (nothing loud, but just enough to annoy).  Gas mileage is O.K., but not as good as other small cars I've had (perhaps due to that additional weight).  And - for whatever reason - Pontiac only built in one cup holder up front(which bugs me a little but really annoys my wife).  There are two in back, albeit one of them is poorly designed, such that it can only hold a small cup or can of soda (I can see the scenario; on any Saturday night, passengers in Sunfires all over the country are fighting -- after the stop at 7 Eleven -- over who gets the larger rear cupholder).  

But those minor complaints aside, this is flat out the most fun you're going to have with a small domestic car.  I've had more compliments driving this around than any other car I've ever owned.
