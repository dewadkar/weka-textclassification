            Ok we had to get rid of our truck because I was pregnant with our third child. So we went looking for a family car, and there she was. Our baby. A 1996 Toredor Red, dual exhaust, sun roof, all leather, souped up v-6, added wood through out the car, and only, are you ready, 21,000 miles on her. We bought this car in 1999 so you could only imagine how well the one owner took care of it. Now granted we have only had this car for a year, but we have had not one problem with it. Perfect car for space, reliability, etc. I highly recommend this car! Not only does it serve the purpose of being a family car, it is also one of the sportier 4 door sedans around. We are proud to say we own a mercury!!<br><br>
