            After many, many hours researching the internet and talking to actual corvette owners, I finally broke down and purchased a 2003 coupe. I LOVE IT! The handling and power are terrific. The feel of the seats, the leather wrapped wheel and a cluster of gauges that keep you informed of multiple functions through out the car. I choose the 6-speed to really enjoy the sports car experience. I had driven a 1998 coupe when it was new and enjoyed it and five years later Chevrolet has done a good job to work out any bugs from the early C5's. I took advantage of the heads up display and the power memory driver's seat is priceless. I only have 200 miles on the car so I can't wait to get it broke in and push the tach into the real power band. After watching the video that came with the car, you truly begin to appreciate the technology and work that go into the making and designing of the Corvette. The drivetrain is noisy but the video states that it is "normal" for the transmission design and location. The body panel seams are not as equal as I would of liked to see in this priced or any priced American made vehicle but other then that the car comes with a huge list of standard equipment that will amaze you.

With a steep price tag, you can probably lease one for much less then you would of imagined. I was able to get payments into the $500's. Not bad for a $50,000 car.
