            We just purchased a 1992 Mazda MPV (January 2004) It's main reason for purchase was for my fiance to get back and forth to University, and to carry our 11 year old daughter around. The vehicle we bought has 130,000 miles on the clock, and only had the 1 owner from new. It had been looked after religously! With oil changes every 2000 miles, tire rotation every 5,ooo miles, regular servicing, tunes, etc. The engine runs very strong, despite its 1994 age. It is not the 3.0 V6 model however, it is the 2.6 4-cylinder version, and has plenty of power when needed. We currently get approximately 25MPG out of it, which really is quite good for such a large vehicle.
<p>
As for space, the MPV is of huge proportions on the inside. It has seating for 7 people, and when sitting in the very rear, you would think you were on a coach! It looks so far to the front. The seats are very comfortable and quite luxurious. The MPV has rear air and heat, controllable by a function center at the rear.
<p>
All in all, this is really an excellent vehicle to own. I would recommend one to anyone looking for a quality, luxurious, economical, and inexpensive mini-van. It really is amazing to have so much room on the inside, and yet be relatively small looking from the outside. An MPV (4.5m long) is actually smaller in length than a Chevy Impala (5m long)... which is amazing when you are sitting in the rear of an MPV looking forward.
<p>
The front passenger seat can go all the way back to being flat, even with the middle row of seats moved all the way forward. This allows a passenger to lay down with their legs fully outsretched. How many vehicles can you say are able to do that?
<p>
Good gas mileage, good performance, excellent interior with power everything, amazing amount of room... BUY ONE!
