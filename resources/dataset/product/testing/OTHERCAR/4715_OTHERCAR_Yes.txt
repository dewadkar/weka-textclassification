            BMW, The Ultimate Driving Machine?  Yes and No.  The Midnight Blue 7 Series my fianc� and I own is certainly a beautiful looking car as it rolls down the road but it doesn't come problem free.  This is my second BMW, the first one was a white BMW 328 convertible that was an absolute lemon!  Yes, I did learn my lesson the first time around but I did not purchase the 7 Series.  It was given to me by my fianc� because it's on a three year lease and he's driven it so much that we're over the mileage limit.  Since I work close to home, we traded in the lemon and bought a Lexus SUV LX470 (we love it so far).

Anyhow, getting back to 7 Series.  Here's my overall assessment of the car.  (Note: to see my fiance's assessment of the car, please see his epinion.  User name is &quot;Huge.&quot;  He's owned 5 BMWs.

What I like:

1   The ride.  This car drives like a dream and is very smooth on the road.  The seats are incredibly comfortable.

2.  It overall comfort.  It has tons of room in both the front and back seats.  Passengers love riding in it.

3.  The stereo system is fantastic.  Very high quality.

4.  Bells and whistles.  There are lots of them so if you love hi-tech gadgets, this is a dream car.  Very cool.

5.   I like the way the car looks and the overall design.  There is a lot of attention to detail and it's generally very attractive.  It's also really fun to drive and handle incredibly well.

6.   I love the heated seats!  This is a must because my fianc� and I are always fighting about our temperature differences (in our house, outside, inside, etc.)  These heated seats have spared us some fights.

7.   Onboard computer.  I'm not sure if I love this option or hate it.  The onboard computer gives computer generated voice driving directions (a great thing for men!).  I never find myself trying to be a backseat driver.  However, the position of the on board computer on the lower right hand side of the dash does make you take your eyes off the road.  So be careful.  Also, the voice often interrupts to give directions when you're listening to music; this can be extremely annoying.

8.   PDC: Parking Distance Control.  This is a cool options and a must have.  No more scratching your  front and back fenders.  PDC beeps to let you know how close or far you're coming to objects.  Since this is a big car, this is a great feature.

What I dislike:

1.   Electrical problems: Before you buy, be sure to ask your dealer about the electronic locking system.  The locks never seem to work properly with these cars.  I had problems with both the 7 Series and 3 Series.

2.   The 7 Series also has a mysterious exhaust problem.  When the car is idling at a stop light, it often makes an irritating high pitched whistling sound that BMW mechanics can't seem to fix. The humming sound comes and goes and every time I schedule to bring the car in the sound disappears.  Either that or the mechanics suddenly have lost their hearing.  Actually, a mechanics did hear the whistling once and we were told the problem was corrected.   One month later, the sound was back.

3.   The other issue I have with this sedan is it's a monster of a car, especially for a woman.  I'm fairly tall (5'9&quot;) yet I find it difficult to see out the windows even with the seat properly adjusted.  There are also a few blind spots.

4.   The position of the built-in phone console between the front seats makes it impractical to dial while driving.  I find myself taking my eyes of the road to make calls which concerns passengers when they're in the car.  I've disconnected the phone which cost an ungodly amount to begin with -- $1100.00!  I bought a Nokia phone which I plug into the lighter and it works just fine. 

5.  DO NOT try to roll down both back windows at the same time with the front windows rolled up!  You'll bust your eardrums if you try it while driving over 35mph!  I'm not sure if this happens on all cars but this is a major design flaw in the 7 series.

6.   Gas guzzler.  I live in Northern California.  Need I say more.

7.   CD changer is in the trunk.  This is a major drawback because I'm constantly in the truck putting in new CDs.  If you're lazy or forgetful, you'll end of listening to the same CDs for days on end.

8.   Brake dust is a major problem.  As soon as I get the car cleaned, the wheels seem dirty again.  I feel like I'm constantly at the car wash.  If you plan to have the car for a long period of time, you may want to consider upgrading the brake pads.

9.   Getting a service appointment in my area is an absolute nightmare!  They always promise loaner cars but never seem to have any when you drop your car off.  I have not been impressed with service.   Obviously this is not a &quot;car&quot; problem, but it does factor into how I &quot;feel&quot; about my car.

10.   If you're planning on getting a car with tan interior like we have, be sure to consider black floormats.  Tan floormats get dirt stained within days of purchasing the car.

Overall: This is one of the best sedans on the road yet is has some drawbacks that cause me irritation.
