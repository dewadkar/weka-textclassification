                Do you want a new sleek, sexy car?  Look no further than the BMW 3 series.  This car was introduced into the BMW family in the summer of 1999.  The minute i first saw one, I fell in love with it.  This car has all the amenities of a luxury German engineered car, and at a decent price.  The 323i starts at at $26,990(including destination charge) and the 328i starts at $33,400.  
    
    The new 3-series is a great improvement over the old one.  It has more space, and a larger engine.  The 323i has a 170 horsepower 6-cylinder engine, and the 328i has a 193 horsepower 6-cylinder engine.  As well, the most noticeable change is the new body, with a sleek, elegant new look, but yet still sporty.  
    
    I love this car because it is so user friendly.  For example, it has an automatic dimming rear-view mirror so when driving at night, the lights of cars in the rear don't blind the driver.  Another great feature is on the radio, when going in and out of radio zones, by pushing and holding the FM button the radio, the car will automatically pickup and store and the 6 strongest radio frequencies in the area.  
    
    There are tons of amenities which can be selected to tailor the car to your own specific needs.  For this reason, the majority of BMW's are ordered directly from the factory and it takes approximately 2 months for delivery.  Some of the nice features include lumbar support, rear fold-down seats, heated mirrors and seats, fog lights, xenon head lights, and an onboard computer.  The onboard computer is nice because it tells you the average miles/gallon, average speed, outside temperature, and how many miles until the car runs out of gas.    

As for driving, this car sure drives great.  I chose the automatic transmission over the manual, and the shifting of gears is extremely smooth.  The car accelerates great, a cool 0-60 in 7.1 seconds(the 328i does it in 6.6 sec).  The car corners amazing as well.  The overall feel of the drive is excellent.  I feel very safe, as if driving in a tank.  The car also sticks to the road like glue.  It has stiff steering wheel and gas pedal.  The stiff wheel I like, especially when driving on the highway because it prevents the car from swerving much in the lane.  I recommend this car to anyone who is in the market for a luxury sports sedan with an attitude.  The car is a beauty and attracts a lot of attention.  A Great Buy.


<b>AN UPDATE ON A YEAR OLD CAR</b>-After having this car for a year, I can report to you on all the problems it has had.  Don't get me wrong, it is a great car. It hasn't had any major problems, and it drives ridiculously amazing. But I have had many small problems with it (all of which I got fixed the other day for no charge).

First the sunroof was broken. It would work spontaneously and sometimes I would open it, but then it wouldn't close. Next, I had really squeaky brakes, which I guess happens on all cars. I also had some insulation stuff come out from a corner in the trunk, and once in the car. Just recently, when I shifted into park one day, the gear shifter (not the transmission) got messed up, so that I had to be one gear below the actually gear I wanted to drive in. There was once something rolling around in the ceiling too. The windows also would squeak rather loud whenever I put them down. And lastly, I have a problem with the engine coolant light coming on even though its reservoir is full. But...as I have said, BMW fixed all these problems free of charge!

I have a year 2000 323i and other friends of mine who have the same car have experienced similar problems. However, people that I know who have the 323ci have not had any of the problems I have had. And who knows...the newer models may be better built and have less problems...I just thought potential buyers should know of some possible problems before purchasing the car. Other cars in its class are the Acura 3.2 Tl and the Lexus IS300.<br><br>
