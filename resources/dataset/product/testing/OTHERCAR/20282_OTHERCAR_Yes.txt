            The first car that I purchased was a 1990 Nissan Sentra that was completely stripped: no radio or a/c (I added these later) and a 4-speed transmission.  This car was a pleasure to drive until summer '98 when the air conditioning system ran out of freon. I decided to trade in the car instead of purchasing a new air conditioning system- air is a must when you drive a black car in Atlanta!  I shopped around for a few weeks before settling on a Nissan Sentra or a Honda Civic.  The Nissan dealer ran one heck of a sale at that time so I bought a 1998 Nissan 200SX for under $13,000.  The 200SX is a little two door sporty version of the 1999 Sentra.  It has a spoiler, a sun roof, a cd player, cruise control, power windows and locks and the list goes on and on!  This car has been an absolute joy- even better than the Sentra!  I have had NO problems (just like the previous Nissan I owned), the gas mileage is great (over 40mpg), it is agile and responsive, and is so fun to drive!  I am sold on the Sentra and the 200SX.  You can't do any better for the money!<br><br>
