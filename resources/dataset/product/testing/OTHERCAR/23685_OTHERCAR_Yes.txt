            This is the first time I've seriously looked at buying an American car in over 20 years. The PT is nicely designed and thought out. If the mechanical side lives up to the rest of the design, this is a sure-fire classic.
How did I get here? My van got totaled when somebody hit me. The rental company gave me a big Impala at first, but I took that back as a danger to me and the rest of the world. The only other car they had was the PT Cruiser. So I took it. My thinking? Cute to look at, but do I want to be seen in one ALL the time? Hmmm, have to think on that. 
But from the first moment I got in I was impressed. The visibility does have a couple of small problems, but it is better than my Mitsubishi van, which was about the same as my previous car, a Honda Accord. Initially, the acceleration seemed a bit weak. Then I punched it a little, and whoops (!) she got up and WENT! Better than my van or the previous Accord, or my wife's current Camry (which is no slouch!). It ain't a Chevy short block with a Holley 4-barrel, but it was more than enough to merge, pass, squeeze out of a tight spot between 2 18-wheelers, etc. The model I'm driving is the "Touring Edition", but this is supposedly the same powerplant as all the other PTs. I can't figure out what everybody else is complaining about. It's not an Audi Quattro, or a Mustang 5.0, but what are you looking for? I found the handling to be quick, robust, predictable, and stable. Mind now, I haven't done any cones or test tracks, this is all local highway driving. 
I like what I've been driving.

Now if I could only figure out how to carry my canoe when we head out for a canoe weekend!
