            My Infiniti QX4 is the second Infiniti product in our household.  The first is a 1998 Infiniti I30, which performs like a dream and rides beautifully.  After I accepted a job in Denver, I decided to purchase an SUV.  Based on our experience with the I30, the first choice was the QX4.  Even though the 1999 models had already been released, I found a new 1998 that had not yet been sold.

After less than 250 miles, I had some serious vibration when driving at highway speeds.  The dealer's service department told me that the vehicle needed an alignment.  I thought that odd with only a few miles, but didn't give it much more thought.  I then drove the car from Texas to Denver to start my new job.  I wasn't sure I would make it there!!

The vibration was intense and there was also a high-pitched whistle (which turned out to be from the sunroof).  Over the next two months, my vehicle stayed at the dealership more than with me.  The details are painfully long, but suffice it to say that by the time the vehicle had 5,000 miles, I was on my third set of tires.  To Infiniti's credit, they replaced them at their cost.

During this period, the local dealership was not able to adequately determine the source of the problem.  Infiniti finally flew a technician from California to Denver specifically to examine my car.  They touted this to me as their commitment to customer service.  My response was &quot;Why would I want a car that NEEDS a technician to fly across the country to diagnose a problem?&quot;  The result of his visit was the third set of tires.

I have also complained to them that shifting from first to second is extreme. Passengers in my car notice it.  It is embarrassing to drive what is perceived to be a luxury vehicle only to have people ask why the shifting jars them in their seats.  This issue fell on deaf ears with Infiniti.  The manager at the local dealership told me that he drove the car, and the shifting was normal.

Finally, this is the most seriously under-powered vehicle I have ever owned.  We live close to the mountains, and I don't feel comfortable taking the car on I-70 through the mountains.  There are times when I have the &quot;pedal to the medal&quot;, and am doing 60 mph.  Cars (and SUVs)with significantly less sticker prices are zooming by me.  We have now resorted to using the I30 for mountain trips, which is truly sad upon reflection.  We bought the SUV specifically because we wanted to use it in the mountains.

As for my final words, &quot;I own one and I DON'T understand.&quot;
