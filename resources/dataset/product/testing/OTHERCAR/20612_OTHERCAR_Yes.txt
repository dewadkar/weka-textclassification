            I have driven 60,000 miles in my A4. I love it, it's the most comfortable and stylish car I have ever owned. The quality of the interior, mine is black leather and wood, is unquestionably luxurious. The BOSE concert stereo is wonderful with the exception of the 6 CD changer in the trunk. This has always bugged me. When you finally work out which way to insert the cartridge, the electro mechanical noises are disconcerting. Mine finally gave up the ghost after 18 months.

AUDI thinks of everything, the interior lights come on when you come near the car and the key allows you to close the windows and sun roof from the outside. (How many times have you got back in your car and turned the ignition on to close the windows!!! ) There is a first aid let and special pouch for your skis, so you don't get snow inside the car. 

Compared with most 4WD cars or SUV, the A4 has great fuel economy, at 24-26 mpg in mixed traffic conditions, 27-28 on highways. Compare that with your average SUV 4WD at 14mpg. (it is also much safer than an SUV, by they way. You are almost 6% more likely to get killed if you drive an SUV by the way, the car you hit is going to be even worse off!)

The only thing they don't have is a 'door open' warning light on the dash. (Yes, it has a trunk open light, not a door open light!) I questioned this with my dealer and they thought it had one too, but just wasn't working. As the car was still within 50K miles, they changed the entire instument panel for me. But it still didn't work ... because there is no indicator light ... duh!

The downside of the A4 2.8 is without doubt it is underpowered at low speeds. It cruises nicely at any speed, but the pickup and acceleration is not really there. I guess the 6 cylinder engine purrs well at high speeds (95+) designed for European highways and long distance driving.

Another downside is the cost of maintenance. The free services run out at 50K, which I think is low for a quality car. The 62.5K service, my dealer persuaded me to change the timing belt ("and while we have the front end off, we recommend you change the water pump"). OK, $1,700 later, I left the dealer.... broke. The thing that really peeved me was I had a flat tire a week later and it was clear the wheels had never been removed. I had to call AAA to change the spare. You would think that they would at least rotate the tires occasionally. When I questioned this with AUDI, they said that it wasn't standard servicing option to do this "as the tires wear evenly on a 4WD". If this is the case, why were my front tires down to the wear limit and the rear ones OK? Realistically, you are going to pay 25% more for labor costs for most German cars compared with your boring old American car. (I think it's worth it to get superior German engineering though.)

A minor point is the lack of rear visibility. I reversed into another car the first week I had it. Whoops.

In summary, as long as you are the driver or passenger, you will love this car, if your kids are small or you have short friends, they won't mind the back seat, but there isn't much legroom back there. I expect to keep mine for another 50K miles, it still looks new, and I prefer it to the newer model A4.
