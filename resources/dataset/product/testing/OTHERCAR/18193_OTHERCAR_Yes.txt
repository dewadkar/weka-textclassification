            I purchased my new '96 Pathfinder LE in April of 97.  With a $34,000 MSRP (approximately) I was able to get it for under $28K...and it has every option imaginable...  The heated leather seats I could do without here in Phoenix, AZ...but the rest of the goodies I like.  

I have had only two problems with the car.  The first problem was that it took three replacement CD players to get one that would work more than a few weeks.  I suspect this is a known problem with the particular equipment they used.  The second problem was that the OEM tires (Bridgestone Desert Duelers) were horrible.  They cupped and wore prematurely.  They howled on the highway, and caused a bad steering effect.  So bad were the tires, that I thought the whole suspension had problems.  I had it checked, and the suspension is good.  A new set of Michelin tires, and the darned thing rides smooth as silk, and quiet as can be (for a truck.)  I can't believe the difference a good set of tires make on this car.

Other than that, the car has had no problems.  It gets 18 mpg city/highway...has remained rattle and squeak free.  The steering is precise and tight, and the engine noise seems less than when new.  It drives and rides much better than it did the first 20,000 miles, (thanks to the new tires) and I believe I will keep it another three or four years.  <br><br>
