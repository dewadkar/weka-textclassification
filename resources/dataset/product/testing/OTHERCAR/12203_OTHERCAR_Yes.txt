            Yes, the Dodge Viper is a raw, mean, torque laden sports car.  However, does it deserve super car status?  What about for those who are looking for a daily driver capable semi-exotic?  The Viper is good, and sometimes GREAT at what it does - which is to provide tons of smiles for its passengers and tons of smoke with the rear tires.

The Viper has more than enough power to embarrass most teenage boy racers in the normal Mustang next to you at the stoplight BUT might require some finesse to do so.  Any car with as much bottom end power as the Viper will need some technique to launch properly, even with the HUGE 335mm tires on the back.  

There are other reasons why the Viper doesn't possess all the qualities of a car you would want to drive every day.  The plasticky convertible top, for instance.  And not all models have A/C.  The biggest complaint for those who have owned it is the lack of ABS.  The tires are expensive enough with normal wear, let alone having to replace them if you flat-spot them in a critical braking maneuver.

The Viper makes a great sunny day weekend car, which is probably how it will be used by 75% of the people that buy it.  But I don't think it has the capability or the luxury to perform as much more than that.

To conclude on a positive note, if you are interested in modifying your Viper, there are some very simple and wonderfully rewarding things you can do to bring it to the 500hp level.  Modifying the intake, the exhaust (and catalytic converters if you wish), and fuel delivery will bring about quite a few more ponies and will make it that much harder to launch off the line.<br><br>
