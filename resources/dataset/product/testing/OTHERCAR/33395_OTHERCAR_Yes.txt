            The quality of VW cars is unquestionably super.  Tell me what other manufacturer can offer a car with a 10 YEAR/100,000 MILE WARRANTY.  Yes, you heard it.  That is what I call true European manufacturing.  The Jetta is a no doubt excellent car.  The tires are wide which provide for better handling and a smoother ride.  The whole engine is kept well with many covers and other means of protection.  The car's halogen bulbs look like crystals from a front view.  For a price of around $16,000 this is a best buy.  OOOh, and did I mention the OVER 40 standard features?<br><br>
