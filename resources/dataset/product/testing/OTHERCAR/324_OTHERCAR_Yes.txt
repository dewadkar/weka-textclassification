            I have been the owner of Ford Explorers for the last 8 years. Before that, a Ford F-150 pick up. When it came time to trade in my 94 Eddie Bauer Explorer, I figured that I would just get a new one.

But........ I went to an auto show here in Tampa and tookmy time checking out the new SUV's. I have always been a loyal Ford driver, but the Xterra at the Nissan display caught my eye. It is truly distinctive looking and the smaller size than an Explorer makes some sense when city parking is concerned. I decided that I wanted something new. I was getting tired of having to carefully pick my maroon Explorer out from the 4 or 5 others that always seemed to be in every parking lot.

After picking up the brochures, I did some research on the internet. The Xterra certainly faired well in consumer reviews, and the price is unbeatable in the market. The top end SE 2wd Xterra lists around $24,000 which is alotmore palatable than the $32,000range of the 2000 Explorers. 

Time for the test drive, arranged through Autonation.com. I was impressed with the handling and the smooth ride. The Xterra is built on the Frontier pick up chassis and is a solid frame. While not a mechanic by a long shot, I could feel the difference over the Explorer. I am also comforted by the long experience with the Frontier that service centers have. Essentially, this is a Frontier pickup mechanically, with a snazzy shell.

So...... I bought it. I have been driving it for about a month now and I still never fail to get comments at the gas station from folks who are impressed with the way it looks. I purchased the Blue Denim version, but also would have gotten the silver or white one. The interior features are a bit spartan, no real frills, but everything is easily accessible and easy to use. Cargo space is ample although to put the back seats down, you have to remove the cushions. That is a bit annoying, but not particularly difficult to do. 

The V-6 is a must, as I don't think the V-4 would have enough get up and go. The Xterra corners well (well for an SUV that is) and has a nice solid feeling on the road. The interior bike rack is an outstanding feature for bikers out there and is easily usable, holding two adult size moutain bikes easily. 

While by no means does the Xterra ride rival the Lexus or Navigator, I could buy 3 Xterras for the price! 

At $24,000, the Xterra is a bargain and compares favorably with much higher ticketed SUV's. But most of all, it is just plain cool looking.
