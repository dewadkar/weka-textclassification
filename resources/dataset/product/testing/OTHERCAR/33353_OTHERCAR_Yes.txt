            This is the greatest car I have ever owned.  I bought a 1999 Nissan Pathfinder last year and I have never been so satisfied with a purchase.  This car has such a smooth ride, I feel like it's more of a luxury car than an SUV.  It is an affordable alternative to the Infiniti Qx4.  Nissan is also a very trustworthy and reliable car company.  I am currently leasing the Pathfinder, and am already interested in the newest model.  I am seriously contemplating purchasing the 2000 model after my current lease is up.  

It costs about $25 to fill up the gas tank, and has what I consider to be great gas to the mile.  The inside of the car is leather and VERY comfortable!  It has heated seats, depending on the make and model.  This SUV is very dependable, yet stylish.  The sleeker, smoother look of the 99 and 2000 models really top the 96/97 models.  Only added benefits.
I would recommend this SUV to anyone.  A teenager first learning how to drive, a college student, or it could be a family car. I love the Pathfinder, I leased the 96 model before the 99.  I hope that you will seriously think about purchasing this fine piece of machinery.<br><br>
