            It was with some apprehension that we gave up our trusty '81 300D for an SUV. . .especially at the money. We found a dealer (Eurocars - Tallahassee) that was straight and found us exactly what we wanted (well, almost, we had to take the heated seats which will not likely be very useful in Florida) to get a timely delivery. There was no pressure and a frank discussion of the relative merits of things like extended warranties.

The delivery and purchase were smooth and hassle free. Next we faced a lot more electronics and hydraulics than we have ever seen before (and are still learning about all of the goodies)and are getting comfortable with it one week later. It all works quite well indeed. The Bose system is excellent.

The car rides very, very well. It is smooth away from a light and takes rough roads very well. There are no rattles (yet), or squeaks, and the care is tight and well mannered.

Now 4 months later we have experienced some malfunctions: the cruise control went out at 1100 miles and the automatic seat adjustment feature that modifies with the different drivers is also out. We are now experiencing some driving fatigue from the seats when over two hours, perhaps because my wife and I are tall.  We have not yet found the seat positions that would say that we could sit in these seats all day.

We plan to keep this car for a long time and are quite satisfied with the deal and the car. We hope that continues and that the mechanical problems reported in the 1998 are all corrected . .they seem to be.<br><br>
