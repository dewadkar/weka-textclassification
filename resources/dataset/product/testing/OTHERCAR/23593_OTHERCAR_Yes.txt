            Overview:

I bought this car brand new back in July 2001.  I don't have too many complaints about the car.  It's fun to drive and has been dependable and trouble-free.

Under the Hood:

It comes with a stock 3.0 liter inline 6 that pushes out 215 horses and 218 ft. lbs. of torque.  The only downside to the engine is the average 21 mpg of gas that it consumes.

Exterior:

Very clean and sporty styling.  I love the self-adjusting HID headlamps.  The taillamp design is the first of it's kind.  It's a trend-setter(just check the new nissan altima and maxima taillamps).  The stock silver 17 inch wheels that came with my car are very sleek, however, I wish I would've known about the polished version.  It also has a big polished tailpipe, so be careful when going up or down steep driveways, i've bent mine already.

Interior:

Very comfortable seats.  The guages are simple and easy to read.  But there is a guage that measures fuel efficiency that I really have no use for, and wonder why it's even there.  I love the look and feel of the steering wheel.  The car only came with an automatic transmission that year but it also has a manual e-shift option.  When this option is used you can shift on the steering wheel formula one style.  It's a very cool feature.  The six disc in-dash changer has worked flawlessly and the 6 speakers are very responsive.  There is one feature on the stereo though that I find that does not work very well.  It is the "Traffic" button.  It's suppose to tune you into traffic news where ever you are.  I find it useless.
