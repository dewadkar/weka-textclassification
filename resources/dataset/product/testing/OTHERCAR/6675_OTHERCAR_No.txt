            I don't own a Dodge van, but I do drive one at work frequently.

I work valet at a casino and our transport vehicle is a 15 passenger Dodge van.  Currently it has 23000 miles on it and it's starting to show.  Granted, it has been driven into the ground, but aren't these vehicles made for hard usage?  It creaks and moans with every move it makes.

It's currently out of commission with a broken axle(?) and I'm not sure when it will be repaired.

The stereo is ok for a basic people mover, but for a long trip it would leave a lot to be desired.  I've taken a few customers home and the highway manners are acceptable for a vehicle this large, during a rainstorm would be a different story though.  I can feel the pull in the steering when I brake hard when it's dry, so rain slicked roads would be a nightmare.

I know the axle problem is due to the abuse me and my co-workers put on it, but the creaks and moans alone would keep me from buying one.<br><br>
