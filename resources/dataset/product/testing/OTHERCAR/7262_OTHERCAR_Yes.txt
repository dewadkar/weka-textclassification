            This car is great... I own this car. Great power, pickup and I get a mileage of 34 on the highway. But city mileage is less than 20. I have a fully loaded car with Onstar security feature. It comes with a BOSE music system as an option for just 50-100$ more. Thats a best buy. Its also equipped with Eye-Que Display, this shows all engine and car controls displayed on the windshied. I have been put in 13000 miles... Absolutely no problems so far. 0 Maintenance. Got a great look and quick pickup. 
One thing I always look for is service and recently I had a problem with my car when the security feature disabled my engine. It was because GM said the key uses some radio signal to start the engine and if the key is damaged even slightly it will disable the engine. They sent a tow truck, took it to the dealer, dealer gave me a drive back home and fixed the problem gave me a drive back and all I had to do is sign a paper and take my car. Never paid a penny.
Good work is always good. No matter who does it.
