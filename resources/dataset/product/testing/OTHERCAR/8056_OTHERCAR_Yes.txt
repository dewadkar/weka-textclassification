              My grandfather was a devout Buick man. His first car in the '40s was a Buick and he bought nothing but Buicks until 1988 when he bought a Grand Marquis. He bought that Mercury because Buick no longer sold a rear drive full frame V8 powered car. If he were around today, I would've told him to forget that rear drive nonsense and revisit Buick. The Century would have made a perfect car for him. I rather liked it myself!

Powertrain: A+
  When I picked up the Century at the Enterprise Rental lot I was a bit miffed. I had been promised a new 2002 Camry and the thought of driving around in a Buick for the next four days did not appeal to me in the least. But then I took the car out on the Grand Central parkway in Queens, NY (which for once was not backed up with traffic!!)and I noticed the shear power and smoothness of the V6 engine. Now I admit I've not been keeping up with Buick powertrains so I assumed the engine under the hood was GM's 3800 V6. When I arrived at my parent's home, I popped the hood to find that the Century uses the less powerful 3100 V6. I was shocked because this Century felt very powerful and refined. This was aided by silky smooth four speed automatic. GM builds some of the best shifting automatics I've ever used. It was also very responsive to dropping down a gear for passing. Despite this performance, I averaged about 29MPG on the highway and about 22MPG around town. Pretty darn good especially for an old school pushrod engine!

Steering and handling: B

  This is not a "pinky steerer" like my grandfather's old Electra 225 was. The wheel while a bit thin had a quality feel to it. The steering feel itself was pretty good and not numb at all. While the car does feel big, the good steering helps it feel a little smaller than it is. In fact this steering feels better than that of the 2001 Honda Civic. The new Civic feels lifeless.As for the handling, well its a bigger car so it is not possible to toss the Century into corners. The suspension is rather soft and the car does float a bit over bumps. The handling does feel very safe and secure in a way Buicks of old could never master. The standard ABS brakes are strong and provide good feedback. The body structure is very strong and gives the Century a solid high quality feel even over bumpy roads.

Interior: C+

  The interior is where the "old Buick" shows up most. I'll hand it to Buick designers for producing a tasteful looking dash. The dual mode climate control system is superb and allows the driver and passenger to control their own environments. All cars should have this. The plastics used on the dash while better than in some Pontiacs and Chevys I've seen is still not up to the standards set by the Japanese and Europeans. The split bench front seat is thinly padded and while not uncomfortable it also not very supportive. Side airbags are not available. And then there is the steering column shifter. Always less desirable in my opinion, this particular shifter takes some practice. It is too easy to slide pass drive into one of the lower gears. I also missed having a tachometer. Tachs are not necessary in cars with automatics, but its nice to have one if only for the slightly sportier flare it lends to the dash.

Exterior: B

  The Century will not win any beauty contests but it is a plesent looking car with some nice crisp lines. The tailamp treatment is attractive enough and the overall design is fairly classy and refined. The Buick Regal is the sportier brother and it looks a bit better and bolder. Its a bland styling effort but so are most other cars in this class.

Overall: B+

  With the Century, Buick has really nailed it's target market. Here's a car with a decent and roomy interior, high quality, good road manners and good old American values for a good price. The Custom sedan starts in the low $20ks with a more lavish Limited running a few thousand more. I'll admit the Century is more a car for Grandpa then for me but it give me some new insight and respect for GM cars. Its nice to see an American car company build a high quality piece such as this Buick. I would have no reservation recommending this car to others. It offers much value for the money. If you like the overall package but want something sportier, check out the Buick Regal or the Pontiac Grand Prix. Same basic cars, more fun attitude.
