            We bought this vehicle new in 2002.  It has been a good vehicle for us.  We have put a little over 30000miles on it.  It drives well on the highway up to about 85 mph.  It handles fine in the city.  Everything has held up pretty well.  

It has been in for a recall repair and that went very well.  We were able to get in quick and the repair was done that day.  It has also been in to get a seat repaired that started splitting at the seam.  Last a storage box in the rear broke.  All repairs have been done under warranty and were hassle free.

On long trips, I just wish it would hold more luggage in the back.  If it were just a few inches longer!  It seats 5 well, but seems to not hold enough luggage for more than three on a long trip especially when there is a baby.  Of course, it also seems to be too big in some ways.  It is big enough that it is hard to keep it clean.  Maybe some kind of functional cargo area would help us keep the day trip stuff more organized.  That is my main complaint.  

Another negative is that it has limited towing capacity.  We were looking at a boat, but decided on a motorcycle because it just wouldn't tow much of a boat. 

Also, we lost a remote.  That is expensive to fix and maybe it would be harder to lose if they made something that fit in your wallet or pocket better.  Perhaps a credit card key that would unlock/lock the car automatically when you got close.  For that matter, it could remote start too with a push of a button for cold mornings!
