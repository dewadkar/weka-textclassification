            The Camry is one of the most widely driven mid-sized cars in California. It is so popular that it becomes difficult to find your own car amongst all of the other Camrys of the same year and color.  So, one would think that it must be a dream come true.  Hardly.

A nightmare would come closer to describing reality.  Yes, this car has a very commercially popular design.  And, the V-6 models are quite fast off the line.  However, beyond the engine, this car totally falls apart.  The brakes are likely the worst ever installed in a vehicle priced over $15000.  I have two business associates that also have Camrys and their opinion of the braking capacity is the same.  After only 5,000 miles on the car, the brakes sounded as thought they were without pads and the stopping time is long and frighteningly shaky.  Its hard to imagine that there has not been a recall on the brakes.  

There has been a recall in fact on the steering column.  The notice stated that a screw may come loose and possible cause the steering wheel to come off in the drivers hands and increase the chance of an accident.  Even before receiving this notice, I feared taking the car above 75 mph.  The car doesn't exhibit responsive handling characteristics at higher speeds.  The seats are soft (as opposed to firm) and do not have a lumbar support or adjustment capability.  This makes long distance driving nearly painful.

Overall, this car is an example of how good marketing can overcome poor product design and performance.  I rate this car a C-.<br><br>
