            I have owned a 1995 Chevy Camaro Z28 conv. for nearly two years, although it has had its problems it is a fun car to own and drive.  My Z28 is equipped with the LT1, the former Corvette engine giving is 320 horse power stock.  Now it seems everyone is looking to imported cars for speed and they forget about the powerful American engines in cars such as the Z28.  These imports do have a weight advantage, but to make them fast requires expensive modifications.  If you are like me you want power right out of the showroom without spending thousands of extra dollars.  However, the imports are more reliable.  My car has been in and out of the shop frequently, while imports usually last longer and have less problems.  The only reason I do not like my Z28 is the mechanical problems.  The fun of driving it far outweighs the mechanical problems.  I would recommend this car to anyone who enjoys driving and doesn't mind spending money on the occasional repairs.<br><br>
