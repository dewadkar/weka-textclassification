            I have owned a Kodak 3400 for two days now, my first digital camera. 

It is wonderful! Easy to use straight out of the box! I was amazed at the wonderful pictures this camera takes in the fully Automatic mode. I had my mind made up on the DC280 and found that it had been replaced by this model. I could not be happier with my purchase. My wife, who is far far from a being techno literate, took wonderful photos from the minute she started and all I did was tell her what each button was. She loves the camera and loves how easy it is to use. We can probably get better photos by using particular settings but, we absolutely love the pictures on full auto mode! I have not tried printing yet, but would expect that these will be great also. 

This is a great camera for the money. I immediately purchased a charger and rechargeable batteries which I would recommend to anyone who buys a digital camera. I would also suggest a set of Lithium batteries for spares. I had trouble finding Lithiums but found them at a Walgreens drugstore of all places.

Only con is the LCD screen is placed so that looking throught the viewfinder with you right eye may leave a nose smudge on the screen.<br><br>
