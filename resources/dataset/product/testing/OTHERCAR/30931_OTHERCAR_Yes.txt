            I purchased my Sebring used from a lot.  They had it advertised for $3999; Blue Book was up to $6999.  I had to pay $5999 due to the financing and my credit history, but I didn't mind, because it was still under Blue Book.

Anyway, I drove it home without incident, but later on, I found a slight drip.  From my auto knowledge I found it to be Transmission fluid.  Seemed to be coming from the pan.  Some might say, "well it's a used car!!" - true enough.  But I had a 1990 Geo Storm that had NO problems when I bought it, except for the need for a new air filter.

*UPDATE*
Through my own investigation, I've found out a couple of things.  First, this car started out as a rental car, back in 1995-1996.  It was used as such for 1 year/21,000 miles, then sold apparently at an auction to a consumer, who then turned around and sold it to a dealer, who then sold it to another owner, and then back to a dealer.  Apparently, the previous owner(s) chose not to take care of the car, because every single one of the fluids needs to be flushed.  Midas quoted me $299 for this; the dealer I bought it from will let me just get it fixed free and only pay for the fluid (roughly $30-50 for all).  I changed the oil and the coolant, but the powersteering and transmission fluids are just too much effort, might as well let the guy do them.  But because of the transmission fluid, it's really hard to tell what the gas mileage is on the car.  I CAN say that CITGO gas is terrible.  Sometimes I'll fill half a tank and get 100 miles; other times I'll only get 60.  So as far as gas mileage I really can't tell.  I've been considering selling this one for higher than what I got it for, paying off the loan, and getting a '97 V6, instead of this 4 cylinder (I hate 4 cylinders).  I like this car, but I think the one I got is just not suited for me, even though it's still a great car.  

Aside from the problems with my Sebring, I find it to be a fantastic car.  It floats like a cloud, no problems with acceleration, and driving with the top down is almost therapeutic.  This is a great car for a single person that needs reliable transportation; I can already tell.  Don't let my "used car" issues deter you.  This is a great car, and just because a lot of shopsters see this car...let me tell you something.  99% of problems with new cars in shops is due to the OWNER not taking good care of it.  Oil changes, filter changes, tune ups, good gasoline, system cleaning, and good storage methods all make for a well maintained car.  If more people would take regular care of their cars, they wouldn't be in the shop as much.
