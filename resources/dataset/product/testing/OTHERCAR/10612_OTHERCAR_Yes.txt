                Mazda's B2600i Extended Cab pickup is truly a refined mini pick-up.  I bought one new in 1992, and have never regretted it.  The cab is large enough to put the seats back far enough to accommodate a 6'2&quot; fellow like myself, and have plenty of room for rain gear, sweaters, groceries, etc.
Due to the long wheelbase, the ride and stability are more like a '53 Buick, than a Japanese mini pick-up.  The dealer installed &quot;factory&quot;
sound system rates a B+ and the dealer installed A/C still works like a champ.  The 12 valve four cylinder engine provides better than average torque, although aggressive shifting may be required.  The interior has held up very well, in spite of staying outside, in the elements (no garage).
    On the downside, the bumpers (front and rear) are prone to rust.  Also, the right side window winder vibrates to an open position, causing some rain leaks, if not watched.  Because an over-2 liter four cylinder
engine usually has a vibration problem, Mazda has equipped this vehicle with a truly monstrous flywheel/clutch assembly.  This makes smooth shifting an acquired trait, and first gears synchros wear quickly (no problem if you know how to double clutch).  For winter driving, significant weight should be added to the bed to compensate for the light load there.  The factory tires and shocks should be replaced with oversized units at the first opportunity to enhance handling characteristics.  At 60,000 the front disk assemblies needed replacement for rusting from the inside out (a first for me).  
    So, all in all, this is a great cruiser, particularly on the interstate.  Low ground clearance and soft springing preclude off-road hijinks.  A keeper, for sure.    <br><br>
