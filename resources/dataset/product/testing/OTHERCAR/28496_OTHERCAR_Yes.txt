            This is my 3rd Grand Cherokee, and even though the specs were identical to the 2000 model that I leased before this one, it seems as if time has allowed Jeep to dramatically improve the quality of the vehicle.  Yes, some people complain that the style is dated, but it's still a handsome SUV.  I leased a 2003 high-end Limited with the high-output V8 engine and 5-speed (really 5 1/2 speed) transmission. $38,700 sticker -- after various incentives and firm negotiation got the price down a bit more than $5,000.  The HO engine is awesome -- lightning fast, and if you're gentle with the throttle, surprisingly good gas mileage for a Jeep.  During the first 2,500 miles of ownership I've averaged 17-18 mpg; my 2000 Laredo V8 averaged about 14 mpg.  On one recent 400 mile all-highway trip (speeds averaging about 70-75 mph), I enjoyed well over 20 mpg.  Yes it's on premium fuel, but I can live with that.  Some of the "trick" options work well -- I've grown to really appreciate the dual zone climate control, memory seats/mirrors, and rain-sensing wipers.  Only complaint -- the factory equipped tires are really lousy.  Mine came with the Goodyear Eagle LS -- I immediately replaced them with Michelin Cross Terrains (got $150 credit from the Michelin dealer).  Noticeable improvement in traction (especially wet), handling and road noise.  I had to file this under the 2002 model because this stupid website has no means to list 2003 Jeep reviews!
