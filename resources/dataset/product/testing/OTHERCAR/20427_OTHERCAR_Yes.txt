            I extremely enjoy my Volkswagen Jetta.  I have had it since May.  I can say that it is the best car I have owned.  

The engine is powerful yet does not burn a great deal of fuel.  The only con is that you have to fill the tank with premium.

The interior is spacious, for the front passengers.  You have to work with the front seats to comfortably fit adults in the rear.

The stereo is fantastic.  There is no need for an upgrade in my book.  You can hear this car coming from a block away.  The con is that the CD changer tends to skip when there are no bumps hit.

The sunroof with cold weather package is great.  I haven�t had the chance to use the heated seats on a cold day but you can tell when they are on now.

The rims are classy.  They are 16� which meant that I did not have to change my driving style due to the adequate amount of sidewall on the tires.  I live in New York City and there are plenty of potholes here.

The seats are solid and hold you in place while taking spirited turns.

I have only run into one problem with the Jetta.  A micro-switch went bad on the break pedal.  It caused the break lights to show and turned off my cruise control while I was on the highway.  I called VW service and I was in the next day and out that night.  The service was quick and the job was done well.
