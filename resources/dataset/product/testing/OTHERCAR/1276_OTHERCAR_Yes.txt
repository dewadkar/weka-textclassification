                 Back when I used to own a photo lab, I prayed that digital cameras would never be this good. Well, they did and now I'm no longer in business.Recently I laid my bitterness aside and decided to go digital myself. I was not prepared for the unbelievable product delivered to me by my Nikon 990.
     This camera just about does it all. At 3+ megapixels, the best of which has no compression and amazing clarity,this product should be considered by anyone interested in digital. Although the camera has some very advanced features for the know hows amoung us, it produces beautifully when operated in the fully programmed mode. That means you can just point and shoot with fantastic results.Both the metering system and the focusing capabilities rival some of Nikon's best &quot;regular cameras&quot;.
      The only negative things that I could find were the fact that this camera is a bit power hungry, so a fresh set of rechargebles are highly recommended. Also I have found that because of the location of the flash, even the red-eye reduction feature still leads to time in photoshop correcting eye color.Nikon did provide hot-sync capabilities to add or use different flashes, although I have not as of date tried this feature.
      This product carries a bit of a hefty price tag, but is well worth the capital.<br><br>
