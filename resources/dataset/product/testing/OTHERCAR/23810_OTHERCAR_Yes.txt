            Working for a Toyota dealership allows me the opportunity to find out how both customers and dealer personnel feel about the cars we sell. With the release of the new Echo, the response has been pretty terrific. In recent years, Toyota has stopped production of its more affordable compact vehicles like the Tercel, the Paseo, and the base model Truck. Now with the advent of the Echo, they can hope to reclaim some of the young adult crowd they have lost to other manufacturers.

Simply put, this car is a great value for the money. It looks so tiny on the outside, almost like a toy. But the interior room is incredible. I am 5'9&quot; and my friend is 5'10&quot;, both a little taller than the average woman. But when Erin sat comfortably with the driver's seat in the proper position, I had more than enough leg room, without having my knees pressed into the back of her seat, as is sometimes the problem with these compact cars. Even more amazing is the trunk! I could not believe my eyes when I saw how much room there was back there. A fellow employee actually climbed inside and we closed the lid on him, (not for long though!). This trunk is very close in size to the trunk of the Camry, which is a much bigger vehicle. I find myself wondering if the left out important parts to make all of this extra room, but I can't find anything missing yet!

The Echo also gets terrific gas mileage, which is a definite plus right now. With gas prices soaring, this car would be great for those long commutes or weekend getaways. Everyone knows the Toyota reputation for long-lasting vehicles, so I won't bore you with the rundown on that. 

My one and only complaint about this vehicle is the dashboard. In my honest opinion, it looks a little cheap. It is that hard plastic that is common in the lower priced vehicles, and I just prefer the dashes in the mid-range cars. It is completely functional and all of the controls are within easy reach. It is purely the appearance of the materials that puts me off a little. 

When this car arrived at our lot, I actually found myself trying to figure out a way to get out of my Corolla lease. This car is less expensive, and so much more fuel-efficient! I would definitely recommend it to anyone on a budget, or with long distances to travel.<br><br>
