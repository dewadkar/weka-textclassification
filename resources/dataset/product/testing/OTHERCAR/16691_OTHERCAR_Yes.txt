            There is lots to be said about the Sony Mavica FD85, first off this camera is very easy to use and what you do not understand the owners manual contains instructions which are very easy to read and understand. This camera is well worth the $500 just to have the floppy access which saves tons of time, you no longer have to connect your camera to a computer it is as simple as putting the floppy into your computer and all your pictures are there ready to be looked at. This feature is also great because you no longer have to take up precious hard drive space to store pictures with the low price of floppies you just store your disk for later viewing. As for picture quality it has 4 settings you can use and all are great quality for being a 1.3 megapixel in the lowest setting which is still great for viewing on a computer you can fit close to 35 pictures on each floppy which is great. The best feature on this camera definately is the battery life, even with the battery that comes with the camera has close to 2 hours of picture time which compared to all my other digital cameras that ran on AA batteries is unheard of to me and saves lots of money for a little extra money a 4 hour battery can be purchased and i definately will making this buy. The only real downsides to this camera i can say arent major at all 1 is the weight it is a little heavy but technology is heavy second thing is the lens cap gets in the way which is just a neucsence more than anything. Well you heard my view on this camera and i am a regular person using this not a computer pro i hope this helps in your decision. Thankyou for your time
