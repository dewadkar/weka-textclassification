            I bought the car because its interesting price, but now I know that the price is that low because daewoo obviously saved money on parts quality.

In one year this car left me standing at the side of the road already 2 times. The first time there was something wrong with the alternator and the second time the gear was broken. It took 2 weeks before this gear was repaired.

Last winter the car had also quite some trouble getting started when it was really cold. I am concerned what next winter will bring.

The car uses also rather much fuel for a 1300 engine whereas the acceleration (especially when on the highway) is quite poor.

Normally I buy a new car every 4 years, but this one I want to replace before the warranty ends.<br><br>
