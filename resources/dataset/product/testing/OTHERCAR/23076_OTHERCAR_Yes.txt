             I have been wanting a digi camera for a long time. I went every where looking to find one I could afford. I went to CompUSA, OfficeMax, then i went to Wal*Mart and found the PDC640 it was $199.96 I thought that was a good price. So on my next payday I went to but it. But low and behold it had been rolled back to $179.96 I thought oh boy even better!! I have had it for two months now and have been taking pics of everything. 
 The thing I like the most about it is that it has four settings of pic quality from 10 to 96 pics. The poorest pic being @ 96 are still good. Just not as crisp. 
 The Camera comes with a connect cord for your PC, and one for you tv. It also has a wall plug power cord, a nice case, and the software to run and store your albums. The PDC640 also has a LED screen for viewing your work, but be warned the screen takes alot of battery power.<br><br>
