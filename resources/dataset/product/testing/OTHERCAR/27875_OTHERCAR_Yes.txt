            This summer I recently got married to a Corolla driver. At first glance, her 1999 CE model looked a little dinky to me. My first thoughts were "Wow that's a little car, and listen to that high pitched whine of the engine, this reminds me of a neon!" While I am sure she was thinking, "Why doesn't he ever pick up his socks?" 

Ah the wonderful differences between men and women! 

She had leased it for 3 years 36,000 miles for a great price of $228 a month! And the lease just came up on September 28th. 

So we drove that silly little car back down to McInerney's Toyota dealership to see what else we could get. 

What we found was the Toyota Corolla S. A kind of "sport" model if you will. The basic design is the same as the rest of the Corolla's, but this one comes with standard CD, power windows/locks, cruise control, and a cool little red S just above the right rear taillight. We chose the metallic black model with black interior, (the S types only come with black interiors.) 

The S type comes with the standard Corolla 1.8L DOHC (Dual Overhead camshaft) 4 cylinder. A nice engine, but a more desirable inline 4 cylinder would be well accepted I believe. The engine is the cars one weak point. Not in it's design, but in it's absolute lack of power. Don't get me wrong, this is still a speedy little car, but don't expect to do 0-60 in any less than 12 seconds. 

The handling is incredible. I am not one to notice or care much about handling in cars, but when I drive this car I feel like I could corner a dime. 

All right, let's all get to the good juicy stuff, the inside of the car. 

*Front Seats* 

The S type comes with a nice set of comfortable cloth seats. I am 5'10" and with the driver's seat all the way back, it is a pretty good fit. If you were much taller, you would run into a few problems. But for me and my wife, (she is 5'6") it is perfect. The farthest we have driven it so far is to the dealership and back (a good 40 miles) and I must say it is a great ride. 

*Back Seats* 

Now for a compact car, the S type has a huge back seat. I have sat in cars twice the size of it, and still had less leg room. But it is still not very comfortable. If I am driving with the seat all the way back, (remember I am 5'10") my mother in-law, (a petit woman about 5'5") is a little squashed. I could only imagine if a taller person had to sit back there with me driving. 

If I am sitting back there with my wife driving, it is pretty comfortable. My legs would get cramped after an hour or so, but whose don't when you are riding in a car. 

The back seat comes with 3 shoulder belts instead of the old 2 shoulder/1 middle lap belt combo, a nice touch. 

And they have now upgraded the old single drink holder for the back seat into a double! How wonderful! 

*Rest of car* 

The trunk space is huge, I find it to be almost as big as my '86 Grand Marquis' trunk, which is massive. It is very adequate for luggage or groceries or whatever you desire (no dead bodies please). 

One strange thing is that while the interior is black, (seats, dash board, etc.) the inside roof is a creamy grayish color. I am going to check with the dealership to see if this is normal. 

The odometer is digital, as well as an outside temperature gauge located inside the speedometer. A quiet luxury. The steering wheel has a very cool Toyota logo implemented on it, as well as some nice stitching that matches the gauges. 
*Gas* 

With gas prices falling again, (Oct '01) this isn't too big an issue, but it's standard mileage is 32 in the city, and 41 on the highway. 

*Drawbacks* 

The only drawbacks I can come up with (besides engine power and seating issues stated above) are the price and the size. 

Toyota cars are known for their durability and great design. Right now Toyotaï¿½s are selling like hotcakes. 3 years ago, Toyota dealerships were offering incredible deals on their cars, but with their current success, haggling the salesmen down to a more reasonable price is next to impossible. He was completely unwilling to change the price stating that "I want your business, but these cars aren't hard to sell at all." in not so many words. 

And we all know that ALL CAR PRICES ARE NEGOTIABLE. 

I only got a couple hundred off! And he acted like I was stealing his children's future! 

If you are looking for good deals check out (www.carsdirect.com) a great site. 

The other drawback that I can see is that the Corolla is a very small car. With all the SUV's on the road today, getting in an accident in a Corolla could easily be fatal. This is always a drawback when buying a compact car.
