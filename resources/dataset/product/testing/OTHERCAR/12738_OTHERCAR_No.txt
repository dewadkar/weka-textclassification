            We bought a 95 Quest with 38,000 miles on it in December 1996 and sold it in October 99 after adding a further 30,000 miles.  We wanted a van for the usual reasons: transporting kids and the occasional long trip.  As we'd never had a van before, we didn't want a behemoth.  My wife was used to driving a Ford Fiesta (OK, I know they were a joke here, but they are neat little cars in England, where we come from), so the compact Quest worked fine.

Dual a/c and radio with rear controls worked well once the kids got over the novelty of playing with them.

There isn't a whole lot of luggage space.  For us, when there were only four of us on long journeys, that was fine.  The rear bench seat slides forwards and makes a reasonable amount of luggage space.  However, if you have more than four of you in the family and you regularly drive on road trips where you have lots of luggage, you might want to consider something a bit bigger.

The middle seats were captain's seats.  Both those and the front seats were very comfortable.  A sliding middle seat gives easy access to the rear bench.  The captains seats were fairly heavy - my wife couldn't remove them easily.  We have replaced the Quest with a 2000 Sienna, which has seats that are significantly lighter.

I was disappointed in the rear bench seat.  You cannot take it out, short of getting to work with a wrench.  This means that there is no configuration which seats 4 (or 5) with maximum luggage space.  Although you can take the middle seats out and slide the bench all the way forward, you cannot sit on the bench in its forward positions - the seat is folded up.  It is certainly less configurable than the Odyssey or Sienna, but I don't know if Nissan have improved things in newer models.

The ride of the Quest is pretty smooth and long journey's were comfortable.  It drove more like a car than a truck.

We had a fair number of trips to the dealer for maintenance.  The radio went wrong.  So did the antenna.  And both front doors' power locking: one had got such that if you tried to open the door, it instead locked all the doors.  It became a very bad idea to leave the keys in the car!  Two batteries went within 18 months.  A rear window strut broke.  And we had a lot of brake work done.

We were fairly happy with the Quest, or we wouldn't have kept it three years.  However, we are much happier with the Sienna we have swapped it for.  Mind you, we are of course comparing a 95 model with 68,000 miles with a brand new 2000 Sienna, so maybe it is just the newness of the Sienna that impresses.
