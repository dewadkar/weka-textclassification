            I bought this car in October of 1989 - it was a 1990 Nissan Sentra XE - 2-door, standard transmission, 5 speed.

I LOVED this car - it had 6 miles on it when I bought it! Talk about BRAND NEW - I was just out of high school, and working full time {finally} and my Dad thought it time for me to take on some financial responsibilities.

Well, I STILL have this car - and my husband now drives it to and from work.

It has never had let me down and I think my 1999 Grand Am has spent more time in the shop than the Nissan has!!!!  It is a wonderful little car and  is great for a teenager and young adult alike.
