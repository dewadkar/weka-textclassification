            I purchased a slightly used (1952 miles) Outback at the end of September - my 3rd Subie since 1991... and so far, this one is the best!(91 Loyale, retired at 165,000 miles, 95 Imprezia, still running fine at 215,000)  It handles like a Subie, despite being higher off the ground (which is great for backroad driving in WV), but is WAY quieter than any Subie I've had previously (the 95 Imprezia was particularly noisy, though).  While it guzzles gas a bit more (gets 25 mpg as opposed to 30 in the 95) than older models, it more than makes up for this shortcoming by having plently of cargo room &amp; comfort enhancements.  It is also the only SUV type vehicle out there that meets all passenger safety requirements - or so I am told, anyway.
My sons &amp; their friends are avid mountainbikers, and this car can easily carry 3 bikes on the roof - but after a frozen cyclocross race this month, we discovered that it will also hold 3 mountain bikes in the cargo area, as well - that's a lot of room.
Drawbacks so far - the legroom space in the back seat can be a little cramped if you are tall and you routinely truck around kids over 6 feet in height - they fit, but the leg room is tight.  And watch out for that pop-out cupholder - it is not exactly stable, and may dump your drink!<br><br>
