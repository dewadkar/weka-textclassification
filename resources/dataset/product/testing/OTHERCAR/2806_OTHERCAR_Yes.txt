            The Olympus D-400 Zoom digital camera is absolutley amazing. Awesome PC compatibility make this extremely versatile and easy to use. There is no developing needed and you can print all pictures out from your PC. This camera has it all. Don't be warded off by its 1.3 million mega pixels because that is plenty. Looking onto the fairly large lcd digital screen on the rear of the camera is pure delight because basically you are getting a sneak preview of what the picture is going to look like. Just slide in a memory card(also used on the Rio mp3 players) available in 8mb, 16mb, and 32mb and your ready to start snapping away. The 8mb card holds up to 30 or so pictures depending on what resolution/quality you want your pictures and the 16mb card has capacity for up to 70 pictures! Awesome! The cards are reusable, just simply slide your memory card into a flash card(floppy disc-sold seperatley) and transfer them onto your PC and then delete the pictures from the camera. You could even transfer the pictures back to the camera if you wanted to. The D-400 has a 3x optical zoom and a 2x digital zoom making for effective zoom shots and you can view your previous photos on the screen while the camera is off. The Olympus D-400 Zoom digital camera is one of the best and you can pick one up for around $400 at your nearest Circuit City.
