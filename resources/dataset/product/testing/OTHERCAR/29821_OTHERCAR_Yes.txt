            I had the task of purchasing a couple of digital cameras for work.

Someone else specified a Sony because it took floppy disks, and I chose the DC-260.

It has been a little while since I used it, but here's what I remember...

Things I don't like :

o I really don't much like the look of the camera - it just looks odd.

o It takes ages to switch on - really annoying.

o It's battery usage seems a little odd. It really didn't work well with regular batteries, and I had to use NiMH, which isn't really a problem.
It did seem to get through batteries pretty quickly, even more so when you use the LCD often.

o It seemed a little heavy.

o Didn't have shutter or aperture priority control.

o Very slow to recover from a shot.

Things I did like :

o I like the fact that you can upgrade the s/w it uses.

o The fact that it rotates the images when you take pictures on their sides is an extremely smart feature. I really miss that with my Olympus C-3030.

o The camera seemed to be much better at coping with shots into the sun (backlit), of the sun shining through trees, for example; than my Olympus C-3030 is.

Some shots taken with this camera :
