            Five years ago we had planned to buy another Montero, but didn't like the '96 model's new  jump seats & all the hooks and holes left in the back if you removed them , so we set out to find a different SUV.  Since I dislike using a lift and duck style back door, and the extra thickness of the tailgate type made the jump distance a bit high for one of our elderly dogs, we limited the new search to mid-sized SUV's with side hinged back doors only.  That pretty much left us with Land Rover Discovery,  Tahoe/Yukon, or  Isuzu Trooper -- we chose the Trooper LS based on the lower price tag, belief in Japanese car reliability, and the Trooper's generous cargo capacity.

The Trooper has exceeded our expectations.  It has been in for repairs only twice in five years: once to replace the starter, and once to replace a back seatbelt (dog ate it).  Meanwhile, we've really grown to love those 70/30 split back doors!   When parallel parked, if you open only the larger of the two, you can unload cargo and dogs toward the sidewalk -- away from the traffic.  With both doors open, it's easy to load and unload big items, and if you need to drive with an extra long piece of lumber sticking out the back, the little door is just right.

Long visibility is one of the best features of the Trooper. I love being able to see way down the freeway, to avoid problems or make lane change decisions with plenty of time to spare. The Trooper has all the power it needs for confident freeway entry, lane changing & passing, as well.  

We've used the huge cargo area (with back seats down) for hauling everything from antiques to railroad ties. Two or three 110 lb + dogs can stretch out in comfort back there, too.  The rear mounted CD changer has always worked well, even while bumping over unpaved country roads.  

The Isuzu dealer we use for maintenance has been polite & helpful, though unable to fix an annoying seat belt that sometimes seizes up, not allowing the passenger to move forward without unbuckling it & starting over.  Because of the boxy shape of the Trooper, interior wind turbulence & noise used to be a problem when we drove with the front windows open, until we learned we should open the back windows a couple of inches whenever the front ones were down. That did the trick -- less noise and no more windblown hair.  

One real gripe -- the seats are not very comfortable for longer trips.  We expected a truck-like ride in a truck, but think Isuzu would do well to add better lumbar support, and to provide the bucket seats with a fraction more length & width plus a bit more cushioning to make the inevitable bounces and bumps easier on the derriere.  Haven't looked at the new 2002 Troopers yet, so maybe they have improved their seating ... if so, we just may be tempted to get a new one this year.
