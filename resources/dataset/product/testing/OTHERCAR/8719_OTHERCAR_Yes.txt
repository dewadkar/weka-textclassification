            Wow I'm pregnant. Time for a 4 door.  The salesmen kind of talked me into a car he called a gold Bonneville. Sounded horrid to me, but all he had to do is get me in the driver's seat!  

My &quot;sandstone&quot; 95 Bonneville is perfect. Plenty of room for 5 passengers and can easily squeeze in a 6th if the person is short. (the hump in the front middle is very high).  I was elated to know that you could sit comfortably in the back seat with a full size car seat in the middle. In my last car you had to angle your hip just to shut the door.  The tether on my car seat is put to good use in my Bonneville.  

The trunk holds my huge stroller, and all baby supplies, plus leaves plenty of room for groceries.  I have a clear view out all windows and feel safe in traffic.  

Power is adequate and the reliability has been excellent.  There are many nooks and crannies to store things inside.  Gas mileage is fair (mid to low 20's) for a V6.  

I plan to buy another Bonneville in my future.<br><br>
