            In January 1989 I decided to buy my first car.  This was a difficult decision as I really did not know a thing about automobiles.  I looked around a bit at used cars because on my budget I really did not think I could afford a new car.

After looking around for a while and being disappointed many times I decided to look in the Nissan show room in my neighborhood.  At that time the Sentra was going for $10,000 brand new with no extras.  Now, I had been looking at a seven year old Honda for $7,000 and I thought well for another $3,000 I know I will be getting a new car and not someone else's headache.  With automatic, air-conditioning and tape deck the total with tax came to $11,000.  This was the best investment I ever made.

I still have my Sentra today and it is going into its twelfth year.  Granted the car only has 60,000 miles on it but even still it has travelled the highways and streets of New York which can be extremely rough on a car.  So far I have had only two batteries, two sets of brakes and one major overhaul on the air-conditioning.

The Sentra is great on gas having only four cylinders but with today's prices of gasoline I am grateful for this.  The car has taken me everywhere without major incident.  As a woman who drives alone at night on occasion this is extremely important.

The only complaint I have is that the defrost systems is not the best and sometimes in the winter I have to drive with the air-conditioning on to clear the front and back windshields effectively and quickly.

On a whole I recommend this card as a great investment. I take it in twice a year for its spring and fall maintenance and this is more than sufficient.<br><br>
