            Our family of four was split on different style of transportations. Ladies in the family wanted a nice sedan with room enough for at least 4 adults.  Our dad on the other-hand, wanted a truck so that he can haul big items time to time.
I didn't want to disappoint any of them-after all, I have to live with them.

We decided on Toyota Tacoma Double Cab Prerunner V6.

I've checked other trucks with 4-doors: Ford Ranger, Dodge Rams, Nissan Frontier... The reason I chose Tacoma?

Advantages:
1) Roomy:  It seems to have the most spacious room for all four passenger seats.  We were even able to fit six people in the car once(don't tell the  authorities).

2) Power:  V6 engine has enough power to do all the things we wanted it to do:  Hauling people, huge refridgerators, and other shopping errands.

3) Looks:  It just looks great!  Dodge would have to come in second, but Rangers and Frontiers aren't pretty.  Frontier looks ready to transform into a robot (~transformers~ more than meets the eye~).  Tacoma looks great both in and out.  Inside, it looks and feels more like a sedan than a truck.

Disadvantages:
1) Ride:  Well, it's a truck.  I guess I have to accept its bouncy ride especially in the back seat without any heavy load.  

2) Noise:  It's not too bad, but again compared to a sedan(not a fair comparison, I know), it is much more noticeable.

3) Short truck bed:  This can be solved by purchasing a "Bed Extender" option.  With the extender, it is regular bed size.

Latest Addition to the Review:  I suppose I forgot to mention anything about its mileage.  I was getting 13-15 miles/gallon before.  That's when I used to put in ARCO gasohline which has 10% ethanol mixed in.  I heard that the additive(ethanol) may lower mileage from someone, so I decided to try Texaco.  Surprise, surprise!  I'm now getting around 15-17 miles/gallon!  It's been really noticeable.  So, it may be more desirable to you to use gas without the ethanol mixed in.
