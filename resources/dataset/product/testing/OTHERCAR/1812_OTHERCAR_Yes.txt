            I still remember the day when I first sat behind a wheel and my daddy taught me how to drive. It is not so long ago. It was at the beginning at this year. At first, I remember, I was a little afraid, but when I felt Durango, felt how it goes, learnt how to maneuver it, I did not let my daddy drive anymore. I wanted to drive it so much. It has fast acceleration, good brakes, strong, nice and quality chassis, it gives you a lot of breathing space. I like it so much, that whenever we go to a family trip, I drive. I do not let my parents drive anymore. Because <b>this is the car that really makes the driving fun.</b>. It's only drawback is, that it uses so much fuel (15 gallons/100 miles).
