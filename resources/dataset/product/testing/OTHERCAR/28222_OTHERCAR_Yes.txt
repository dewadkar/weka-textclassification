            My friend recieved a brand new Durango last X-mas and I've never driven in any truck like it.  It's got room like a suburban but with a trendy new look!  Dodge's are definitely built to last because this SUV can handle anything!  The Dodge Durango is reliable, handles great, has 4 wheel drive for all that off-roadin and is the most comfortable truck I've ever riddin in!  If you want a truck that's got room for the entire family plus the dog I greatly influence you into trying a Durango, it would be my first choice.  Although it is quite expensive, it's worth every dime!  Power everything, Anti-lock breaks, Alarm, and a great sound system just add to the perfect interior and exterior of this SUV!  If your looking for the right truck that will take you anywhere you want to go.....take a DURANGO--you can't feel safer in any other vehicle, TRUST ME!!!!!! <br><br>
