            I needed a car to get to work and school, so my parents agreed to let me buy one. I originally wanted a Jetta because of their good reputation for quality -- a friend of mine has a 1980 Jetta and it's still running strong --, but all that was on the auction block the day I went was a Passat. for $1000 (us), I walked away with my Passat which I lovingly call Paulina.

As a college student, I have certain expectations of a car. Good fuel economy is a must, a large trunk to carry plenty of equipment -- if you're in film school trunk space is at a premium -- to and from from school, roomy, and most importantly, it must be a tool to meet girls. While this car doesn't fullfil my latter expectation, it does satisfy my other expectations, and then some.

The 2.0 litre 4cyc engine has more power than one would expect without scarificing fuel economy. I've raced soccer moms in SUVs who try to prevent me from merging in front of them with the greatest of ease. 

The 1st generation of Passats has a bad reputation when it comes to reliability, however. Most of these problems surround the automatic transmission. The 5-speed manual transmission is a better choice, not only for that reason, but it also makes you appreciate the refined performance of Volkswagen vehicles. The five-speed combined with the great handling of the vehicle makes for a very fun drive.

The optional retractable moonroof is great. I have A/C, but I never use it because the moonroof is just too fancy.

Drawbacks of the car include, front-end is too low to the ground -- this why very few passats have air-vents on them, they snap-off --, no cup holder or place to install and aftermarket one, and. But the biggest drawback is the cost to repair and maintain a Passat.

My many mechanics describe the Passat has "Volkswagen's Cadillac" -- they probally don't know about Audi -- thus justifing the high cost of repair. Another cost related problem, it's difficult to repair the car yourself which out investing in proprietary Volkswagen tools. Spark plugs cannot be removed with a special $120 wrench adaptor, the throttle body cannot be adjusted without another tool, and shop manuals are difficult to get a hold of -- you might see them on the internet, but usually they're out of print. Even "universal" oil filter wrenchs fail to clasp the slender VW oil filter. If you're a handyperson this might be troubling to you.
