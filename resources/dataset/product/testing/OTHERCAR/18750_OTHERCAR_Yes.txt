            I have had a brilliant silver G35 coupe with 6 speed manual transmission for one month and 600 miles.  I absolutely love it (I'm a 49 year old male former 300zx owner).  Whatever cons one thinks up are vastly outweighed by the pluses.  This car is fast and the 18 inch low profile tires hold the road like glue.  The styling is beautiful.  It is so much fun to drive.   Having never had more than a 5 spd I thought a six speed would be almost too many gears but you get used to it right away and I often skip gears on the way up and down.  

Do not expect a quiet luxurious ride as this is a sport coupe.  You do feel the road but I like the amount of feel.  I would not describe it as a harsh ride.  I gather it's smoother than the new 350Z which has had complaints about ride harshness.

Sure, my daughters (14 and 16)complain about climbing into the back seat but we take our 4 door for any long trips.  Headroom is only a factor if your 5' 9" or more but even then you can slouch a little for short trips.  Trunk space is tight but I have another car with a big trunk and you can fold the seats forward for longer items like my 7' fishing rod.

In summary I can't say enough good about this car and can not imagine anyone who gets it being disappointed unless you don't have an alternate car for larger cargo needs or longer trips with the family.
