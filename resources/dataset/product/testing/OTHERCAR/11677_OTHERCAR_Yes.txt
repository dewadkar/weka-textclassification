            Some men wax poetically about that special car they had before blissed marriage.  Perhaps it was an early mustang convertible, a sleek corvette or a Ford Fairmont they painted bright orange with silver trim on the tires.  I personally lament my Subaru Outback.

Marriage had me give up my bright silver Nissan 240SX.  I missed its sleek curviness and superb handling, but my wife more than made up for it.  So much in fact that after 2 years of marriage we had two children.  Trading in the 240SX we faced many decisions...SUV, 4-door cavalier, mini-van hell?  Then, we saw it! An ad featuring Paul Hogan...stomaching my dislike of Mr. Hogan we went for a test drive and picked up a brand new 1997 model.

Never before had I bought a car that I could find no fault in after one month of ownership.  Not so with the outback.  No blindspots, no annoying rattling of the windshield and the tie-down thingy on the gas tank actually worked.  Unfortunately, my wife's third pregnancy brought on the revelation that the fault of the outback was....not enough room for 3 car seats!

Today, I drive a white mini-van....God...how I miss my outback....<br><br>
