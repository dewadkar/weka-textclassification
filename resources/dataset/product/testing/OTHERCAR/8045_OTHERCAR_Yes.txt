            Well I bought this car last year from a guy that bought it for his daughter.  Turned out she couldn't drive a standard, so he had to sell it.  He bought it from an older lady who did alot of highway driving, so it was taken care of quite well.

When i first drove it, i loved how smooth it shifted.  Very nice to drive.  I live up in Alberta, Canada, so I also needed something that was going to do well in the winter.  And it does handle well in all conditions.  Note I only said 'handles'.

My biggest beaf about the car is the automatic seatbelts.  Nice idea in theory, but not in reality.  When it dips below 10 degrees celcius (about 50 fairn.) they basically stop working.  I try to get in the car, but they are always in the way.  Below freezing they don't even want to move.
My odometer stopped working as well at 197k.  I guess this is a good thing if i wanted to sell it, but not so good after the person finds out.  To get it working I would need to replace all the gagues (its a sealed unit) (about $400 CAN).  So currently it still says 197K :).

The radiator fan shakes the whole car when it spins.
But it is cheap to drive.

I haven't had to do hardly any work to it.  Lots of room inside, seats still work! :)  and are very comfortable.
