            I purchased the Olympus C2500L at a pivotal time in my life--in October of 1999 just after this camera was released.  I had just changed jobs for the first time in 15 years and was going through the usual adjustments and thought I'd reward myself by buying this camera so that I could teach myself a little about photography. It would be a stress reliever.
  I have really enjoyed the Olympus C2500L.  It is a great camera--even for someone like me who does not know much about photography.  I had previously purchased the Olympus D320L--which works fine as a point and shoot camera. But I wanted to do some &quot;Art&quot; photography, and I know that it is possible with the C2500L. 
  Eighteen years ago when I married I asked my husband to give me an Olympus OM-1 (completely manual 35mm) as a wedding present.  I always wanted to learn to be a photographer, but I found that it was very expensive to go out and take 24 exposures and have them all turn out bad.  Of course, that is the beauty of digital photography and this camera in particular.  Once you've gotten past that bite of the initial cost, you can snap away and make as many mistakes as you want with no cost other than the loss of your own time. 
  For the user with little background in photography, you can put the camera in Program mode and just shoot away--taking snapshots all day long.  But this camera allows the potential for doing so much more.  It has an aperture priority mode and a manual mode.  These don't work quite like they do on a regular SLR camera--you have to do some toggling and selecting in the menus, etc.  But the potential is there.  I bought the book &quot;A Short Course in Olympus Camedia C2500L photography&quot; and found it useful.  I also subscribed to the listserv on the C2500L and learn a lot from the photographers there.  I am STILL learning this camera a year after I bought it--mainly because I just don't have that much time to play with it (full time job, husband, 2 kids who play multiple sports).  However, I take the camera just about everywhere I go.  I quickly discovered that if I wanted to take soccer shots I needed the Telephoto adapter to get decent sports close ups.  I also purchased the flash that comes with this camera so that I could take pictures of play performances at the high school where I work.  Both of these accessories are really nice to have with this camera--even if you are a beginner, like me. 
  One of the nicest features of this camera is its macro capabilities--it can get REALLY REALLY close--and it is a pretty easy feature to use.  Also, it is quite easy to bracket exposures--even in Program mode, so that you get the right exposure for your shot.  I've used the remote control and timer feature to take group photos that include me.
  I'll probably upgrade to the next digital SLR within a year or so, but I really haven't finished exploring this camera yet.  The quality of pictures is really good.  I bought a 128 MB compact flash card and use a 32MB smartmedia card in the camera as well.  The dual card feature is really nice--keeps you from having to swap out cards so often. 
  Cons would include not the easiest to understand manual for all the sophisticated features the camera offers.  Also, I've noticed that once the sun goes down it is harder to get the shot you want in the dusk.  Again, probably just my inexpertise.  The on board flash can be finicky at times and if it isn't happy the camera just WON'T take the picture.  And the on board zoom is NOT enough to do sports shots like I wanted to do sports shots.  The telephoto adapter helps somewhat, but then you are locked into telephoto mode and can't zoom back out without removing the adapter.  Also, the telephoto lens did not come with a lens cap for it, so I just try to be careful and carry lens tissue around all the time.  You need several sets of rechargeable batteries--especially if you are going to review your photos in the LCD panel.  But all in all I find batteries make it through a photo session.  <br><br>
