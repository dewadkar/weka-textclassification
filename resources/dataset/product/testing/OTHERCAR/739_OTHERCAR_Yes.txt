            My Nissan Altima was my first car, and I have to say it was worth all 12,000 dollars. At 78,000 miles, I've yet to bring it in for repairs. It runs perfectly. 
     Not only is it reliable, but its gas mileage is incredible for a car that feels like a luxury sedan. I get a good 35mpg highway, and with gas prices the way they are, that helps!
 This car is pretty roomy for its class; I think it seats 5 comfortably. The trunk has plenty of room, plus a pass through into the cabin through the center console.   
The Altima provides a smooth ride, with a stop-on-the-dime ABS brakes. Scored pretty well in crash tests,too. Not the quietest when it comes to keeping out noise, but I really can't complain.
     What I love most about it is the great interior. It has streamlined seats and dashboard, plus a rich looking dark wood trim and chrome door handles. Trust me, you never feel like you're sitting in a mid-priced car when you're in the Altima. Seats are comfy, even in the back.
    If you're in the market for a car under 15,000, even under 10,000, a 94 Altima is definitely your best bet. When your in it, it makes its competition look like cheap pieces of plastic. It blows away the competition! Hey, it must be a great car when my only cons are its cup holders and ridiculously tiny glove box!<br><br>
