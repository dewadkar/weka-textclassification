            First, let me say I have had this Camera for almost a year.  I had wanted a digital for a year or so and the quality was never quite good enough for the price, but then I took the plunge last Xmas (1999) and spent some of my hard-earned bonus on it.  I've been quite happy with it.  

Q: How's the picture quality?
A: It's quite good for a 1+ megapixel Camera.  It beats some of the 2+ Camera's I've seen.  In relation to tradtional Cameras I'd say the quality is close to, but not quiet 35mm quality.  It is a little better than 110mm.  And certainly better than polaroid.  Check out this site I used when I did my image comparisions.  It's a little hard to navigate, but the side-by-side pictures are hard to beat.

Q: What do you like best about this Camera?
A: It looks like a camera!  It is a little hefty with 4 AA batteries in it, but it generally looks and feels like a camera--not something off Star Trek! The buttons are right where you would expect them and no bizarre &quot;my camera is space age&quot; posture. 

Q: Speaking of batteries, how is the battery life?
A: Generally I can count on getting 36 HQ pictures out of the (alkaline) batteries if I use the flash for every one of them. Though if I can keep from looking at the pictures on the viewscreen and keep everyone else from wanting a peek too, I can get 50-60 Pictures with the flash, 80+ without. Bottom line the secret to good battery life is to not use the viewscreen and stick with the viewfinder, which I think let's you take better pictures anyway. 

Q: How many pictures does it hold?
A: Well, this thing comes with an 8 Meg SmartMedia card (not the same as CompactFlash.  CompactFlash has a larger capacity and stores images quicker, but costs more and if I am not mistaken uses more battery power) which holds 36 images at HQ and 12 SHQ (same size image, but SHQ has no compression) or 80 at the lowest quality-setting.  I love taking pictures with this thing, you might want to get another 8 meg card. or maybe a 16 Meg.  Much larger is not practical unless you carry batteries with you.

Q: How do it do with movement?
A: This camera has an ISO speed of 640 film equivalent.  Which is pretty decent.  Though you will find that a flash is required for all but the sunniest days or you will get some blurring unless the person or object is perfectly still.

Q: How does it do in low-light?
A: Very well.  Monkey with the white balance a bit and even without the flash, images come out pretty well.

Q: How good is the zoom?
A: It could be better, I'd like to see a 5x or 6x Optical zoom.  But the Optical digital combo works pretty well.  There is some pixelation with the digital, but it's liveable.

Q: What about the menu, I heard it was hard to navigate?
A: I don't think so, but the non-technically inclined may want to try this camera before buying.  I found it much easier to use than anything else at the time.

Q: What don't you like?
A: Batteries. This thing eats them if only because I like it so much. I'd suggest you get some recharables.
