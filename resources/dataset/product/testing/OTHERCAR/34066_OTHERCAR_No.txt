            I aquired our 96 Neon when my then girlfrined (now wife) and I got together. From the first time I drove the car, I had to say that it lacked power. The 2.0 Engine just slugs up hills, and it hardly get out of its own way. The tranmission has a slip in it, talked to the transmission shop and he said that the Plymouth keeps him in bussiness. As for gas meiliege, we get about 23-26 on the highway, my Plymouth Acclaim gets 32 with a V-6. Every Neon I have seen up till the new model came out has a bad squeek in the breaks, which i assume is break dust. We replaced the breaks on ours and it is still there. The worst part is that there is no anti-theft system (like Chevy's Passlock) and they are stolen in less then 45seconds by the local police dept (ours was stolen, and recovred 2 days later). Here is the funny part, in 96, a passanger side rearview mirror was an option, and this being a basic model, did not even have one of them.  I must say, I will never buy a Neon again, once I pay off this one, I will be buying a Ford or Chevy.
