            Well, I originally did not want to write about my truck because i am a bit superstitious about my vehicles but, I can't not tell about it, it's a great running truck!
We purchased this truck used three years ago and have not had one single problem with it.
Besides regular maintainence, we have never had to replace anything.
There is one bad thing about it, the turning capability is terrible.  Trying to park in a tight parking spot is next to impossible between the size of the truck and the turning.
We have relatives that live over 200 miles away so, we put alot of wear on our truck.  We are also a single income family so, it is our only vehicle at the moment.
So far, we have over 100,000 miles on the motor and it still runs great.  It has a light under the hood with a wind up cord incase you need to check under the hood and it's dark outside.  The stock radio works great.  It is an extended cab so, it seats 5 pretty comfortably.
The bed is a small size bed, a 6'.  It isn't a gas hog either, we can make it to our family's home and back one one tank of gas and still have a bit extra.
All in all, a good, reliable vehicle.<br><br>
