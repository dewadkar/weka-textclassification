            Time to get a minivan.
I have always enjoyed the terrific qualities of the Honda line, so the Odyssey was almost a no brainer.  I say almost, because at the time, they were almost nonexistant on dealer lots.  Knowing this, we opted to test drive a Sienna.  Ugh. The room was minimal and the prices as high or higher than Honda.  Seems that the Toyota dealer was upping their price to compensate for the lack of competition from available Hondas.  
Off to the Honda store.  Found a silver LX just off the truck, test drove and purchased.  Amazingly, the dealer came off the sticker $2500.00.
That was 30k miles ago.  Since then, the performance has been flawless.  Its far more spacious than any of the other vans, converts seating arrangements easily and travels wonderfully.  I keep the oil changed every 3k with Honda fluids and filters and just replaced the oe Firestones with Michelin Harmony rubber.  Local driving yields approx 19 mpg, long highway runs give 28 mpg with the cruise on 70 mph.
Downside : 
Doors : The passenger doors stick.  This model has the manual doors, so I cannot speak for the EX.  When I say stick, I mean unable to open them!  It can take several attempts to get in.  I took it back to the dealer twice and they were unable to do anything, conversations with other LX owners revealed the same scenario.
Stereo : Very tinny and weak compared past and current accords I have owned.  Could it be due to the size of the van?
Body : The body is unbelievably soft and dents easily.  Take care where you park.
Noise : Again, compared to an accord, its got wind noise.
I realize that comparing this to a sedan is not an apples to apples affair; but; the plain truth is that no other van comes close to the Honda.  I've been in Fords and Chryslers that are quieter, but their fit and finish is not comparable with the Odyssey, not to mention their power and dependability, which is not even in the same universe. (neighbor has had a trans replaced in his ford with 6k miles, friends Chryslers brakes failed at 4k and cooling system crashed at 10k)
This is the van to have, if you must have a van.  The only other one to possibly consider is the Sienna, but it is severely lacking in space by comparison.
As far as high prices?  They're not that much higher than a domestic, and my peace of mind is worth much more than the cash difference.
