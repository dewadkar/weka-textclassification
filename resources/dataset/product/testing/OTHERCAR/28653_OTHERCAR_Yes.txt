            I got my Kodak DC20 the summer of 1997.  It is an awesome toy.  I love to take pictures with it. When I first got it, I used it all the time.  It's tiny, and it goes anywhere.

It will hold 8 pictures at 493 x 373 resolution or 16 pictures at 320 x 240.  The resolution at 8 is good enough to play around with.  (My picture on this site was taken with it).  At 16 pictures, the resolution is not worth the disk space.  Because of the low number of pictures it holds, when I use it, I keep my laptop handy to download the pictures so I can take more.  

It has a serial port interface, and it is compatible with every Windows PC I have used it with.  The transfer rate is pretty slow, though. I get tired of waiting for the pictures to transfer, and usually quit taking pictures after two or three sets per occasion.

It uses a 3 volt lithium battery, which can be found at any camera store.
Battery life could be longer, but it is still cheaper than film.  This model has no AC adapter.

If you like taking pictures at all, you need a digital camera.  Buy the most camera you can afford.  Look for a good warranty. (Kodak has a one year warranty).

Get one that has removable storage media, either high capacity memory cards or floppy disks.  Get one that has at least one megapixel resolution, a flash, and an AC adapter.

Last of all, use it.  Use it all the time.  And have fun.  Document your pictures, and back them up, like any important data.

And if you take any really good shots, send me a copy.
