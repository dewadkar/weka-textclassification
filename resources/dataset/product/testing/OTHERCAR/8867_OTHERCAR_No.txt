            I have had weird experiences with Accords this past year. In April of 99, I purchased a brand new 1999 Accord EX. I was satisfied with it, until 2000 miles later, I got this noise coming from the engine compartment. I took it to the dealer to find that the transmission had an internal failure. They replaced it with a rebuilt one(Which made me an unhappy camper). Well, at least they fixed it. Then more noise, they couldn't diagnose it, but if it has a serious problem, bring it back. it has 10000 miles now, still noisy, but unable to fix. I thought maybe it was just that single one. I recently purchased another one, passing the 99 to my wife. My 2000 is an EX V6, much smoother and more powerful. Makes the VTEC four cylinder seem like an old Ford pinto engine in comparison. This car, I drive off the lot to find the sunvisor snap off. Bring it in to have them fix it and the dealer dented it. With much debate, the dealer finally agrees to fix the dent. At 1500 miles, the engine already seems to be noisier than originally purchased. I'm not quite sure what the problem is. Maybe it's because it's American made now. I don't know if I'll ever buy one again. It does have it's good points though. It is very sleek and shapely. Handles very well and controls are well laid out.<br><br>
