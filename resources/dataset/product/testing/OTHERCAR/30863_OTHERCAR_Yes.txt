            I recently had my car in the shop and had to go about 200 miles out of town on a business trip.  The last time I went to this site, the roads were mud and I got very dirty working on the equipment.  I didn't want risk messing up the leather seats in my wife's Suburban.  So, I did the obvious thing and rented a car.  My requirements were simple, it had to have AC, a radio and cruise control. 

The local Enterprise agency had a compact all picked out for me when I got there.  Unfortunately, it didn't have cruise control.  When I challenged him on this, the agent said they didn't have anything else.  After I explained that it didn't necessarily have to be the best, cleanest car, he offered a Suzuki Grand Vitara.  It had 27,000+ mi. and the glove box door was broken, but I had my AC, cruise control and radio.

It felt a little strange at first but being a veteran of 80,000 mi. in a Geo Metro convertible, the controls were familiar except for the 4-wheel drive. Suzuki makes the Metro and Tracker for GM so if it looks familiar, that's why. 

I had no trouble keeping up on the highway, the thing handled the gravel and mud roads on the job site just fine.  I just had to try the 4WD to see how much difference it made on the mud and gravel roads.  It worked so well, I just left it on until I got back to the hardtop road.  I got a little better than 23 mpg on the trip.

It was comfortable if the ride was a little rough.  It handled easily around the job site.  It has automatic locking hubs on the front wheels so there's no getting out and wading in the mud to lock the hubs.  I folded down the back seat so I had plenty of room in the back to keep my tools and spare parts clean and out of the weather.  It was a little beat up so I didn't feel so guilty about putting my muddy feet into it. 

I liked it so much that when I got back, I went out and bought a 1997 Suzuki Sidekick.  You didn't think I was going to buy a NEW one and take it out on service jobs did you?
