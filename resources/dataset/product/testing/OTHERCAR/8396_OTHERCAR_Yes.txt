            This car looks good. I have been driving SUV type vehicles for twelve years, a Jeep Cherokee for about 10 years and for the last 2 years, an Explorer Sport 2DR. Never thought I'd change until... I saw the Coupe and had to have one. I did some research including the reviews herein and decided to buy it. It's a loaded Ruby Red Pearlcoat Sebring LXi Coupe with the 3.0L 200HP V6 and the 4 speed automatic w/Auto-stick option. Unlike some others, I live in the real world, I do not expect this car to be trouble free. Things will break, hopefully within the warranty period. That said the car performs very well while it's not lightning quick off the line (but not bad) it has exceptional mid-range/high speed acceleration. The auto transmission is smooth, the auto-stick feature is fun to play with, but really just a toy, a cool one though. As I read in a not so favorable review... you can't downshift to 1st at speed, apparently the other guy did not see this as a good feature...I do.
Handling is pretty good, they seem to have reached a good compromise between ride and handling. There is a little oversteer in hard cornering, but nothing I won't get used to. Cornering on entry/exit ramps etc. is pretty flat with minimal body roll. The 17" wheels and Goodyear tires do their thing more than adequately. The downside of the handling is the turning radius...if you make a lot of "U" turns this car will be a problem. I can live with it.
Inside, the coupe is real comfortable for the front seat folks... especially the driver. The rear seat is what you might expect for this type of car, not bad, but not a limo either.
Visibility takes some getting used to. Initially you feel a little closed in, the windows are narrow and you sit very low (I have to look up at Mustangs) but again you get used to it. The sound system is very good..read the instructions it will help. The sound system serves a dual purpose by the way, when it's on you don't hear the road noise. When it's off you hear a bit of road noise, but after all, it's not a Lexus Sedan. The trunk is roooooomy. I play guitar on the side and I can get all my stuff in there without folding down the rear seats (by the way...they fold down). I've heard the whining about a lot of plastic in the interior, somebody tell me which new car doesn't have that. Chryslers have always been good for me (except the brakes...gotta watch for that)so I'm not too concerned. The dealer is one I know well and I anticipate service will be good. I like this car.
