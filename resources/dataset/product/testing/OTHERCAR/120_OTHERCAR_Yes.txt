            First off let me qualify any statements that I am going to make. I have been in upper management in a one hour photo finishing chain for 6+ years, and have a tremendous amount of experience in all facets of photography. 

I received this camera as a gift from my company. I am a photographic purist. Film is a good thing. I like the tangeable quality of negatives. I like this camera. It is what is is, a low-mid priced digital camera. It is good for real estate appraisers, insurance agents, auto body professionals, basically any one who needs to file reports, that can be completed digitally, and needs to add photos to the reports. In my business, we provide photographs for all of the above mentioned professions. I see many of our customers are switching to digital cameras because after a simple upload of the digital file, one can drag and drop the photo into the document, and print it out in one easy step. 

The quality of the digital image from this camera is acceptable. What many, many people do is try to print 35mm quality images from these files, often on their home PC printer. This is NOT the way to go about it. If you are looking for a digital file, one to insert into a report, or to send to grandma across the country, then you will be satisfied with this camera. But at this point, I beleive that digital photography in this price range, is NOT a substitute for silver halide, of film based photography. 

One quality that first time digital users notice is that the depth of field in a digital image is non-existant. Depth of field is simply the amount of area, in front of and behind your subject, that is in focus. What photographers try to do is use this depth of field to simulate a third dimension in their pictures by having objects in the foreground and/or background be out of focus, creating the illusion of three dimensions. In digital photography, all objects are in focus. It is weird at first. If you are shooting objects, like houses, cars, construction sites, and the like, this is probably not a problem. If you are looking to capture good/great portraits of your family, stay with film. A digital image is much harder to convert to photo then going from photo to digital. Many people enjoy the convenience of owning a home scanner, which would allow yout to scan a photo into a digital file. 

The compact size of the MX 1200 was nice. It was surprisingly heavy. It appears pocketable, but the weight makes that inconvenient. The camera comes with a 4mb Smart Card. The  Smart Card is the 'chip' that records the image. A 4mb card will hold from 6-12 images, depending on what resolution you shoot at. I would recommend investing in a larger card, 16mb will hold 25-40 photos and cost around $25.00. Battery life is short. The camera uses 4 AA size batteries, and expect to change them after 25-30 shots. You can extend the life expectancy by not using the on screen display, but what fun is that?

So you have a digital image, and want real photos from them, and not the cheesy ones you can print at home on you ink jet printer. What is one to do? Well, here are a few options. There is professional digital printing avaliable to you from some One-Hour labs, like MotoPhoto, Ritz camera, and even select Wal Mart stores. The equipment to look for is the Fuji Frontier Digital Printer. It is a marvelous piece of technology. Another digital output device is a Fuji Aladdin printer, again in MotoPhoto, Ritz camera, and other independent photo labs. This is a more expensive option, figure on about $3.00 per print. My last suggestion is to go online for your digital printing. PhotoChannel, Seattle Filmworks and Ofoto are a few of your online options. All are good sources, and cost will be comperable to 35mm film.

All in all, I would say that if you are looking for a digital image capturing device, then this camera is a good option. If you are looking for a good photo, one to share, enlarge, copy for family and friends, then stick to coventional film based photography, and scan only those images that you wish to have digitized.   <br><br>
