            There are so many digital to choose from, I spent about eight hours surfing the web and visiting camera shops. I Researched price, features, storage medium, and ease-of-use. I didn't understand the Smartmedia card and I was going to make a decision on the purchase primarily because of a cameras ability to use a floppy disk for storage. Boy was I wrong, the Smartcard is a far superior medium. Make sure to buy an extra Smartcard and Smartcard reader, nothing is easier to transfer pictures to computer.

 This camera is very easy to use for  first timer I was able to take it out of the box and in 4 minutes we were making pictures. I love the size- although this was not criteria on initial purchase it fits easily in a shirt pocket or small purse. A zoom feature was important to me on the initial purchase. The 2700 comes with a 2.5 zoom lens, a larger zoom would be nice.  Anyone who knows nothing about photography (and probably does not want to know) will love this camera. It is convenient and the quality of the photos are magnificent. <br><br>
