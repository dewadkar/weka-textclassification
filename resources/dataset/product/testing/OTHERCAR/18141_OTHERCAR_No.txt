            My 1986 Honda Accord was destroyed in a side impact collision.  I needed a car right away and found a 1992 Mazda 626.  I had driven a 626 (manual transmission) previously and found it an appealing car.

The car I found seemed okay.  As a DX it seemed to lack many of the amenities of an LX, but I needed a car right away, and couldn't be as choosy as I'd of liked.  

Allow me to preface the next part by saying that:
- I have been told I drive like a lunatic
- the car had approximately 87k miles 
- and it was from a used car lot.  

Within a year I had replaced a $100+ component of the fuel injection system (some big black hose - I forgot the name), the radiator, serpentine belts, alternator and battery.  As well as 2 tires and all the brake pads.

The automatic transmission fairly jumps when going from first to second gear in normal handling.  Handling does not translate well from driver to road, so aggressive drivers must also be competent.  

The interior looks clean on first glance, but closer inspection reveals a lack of attention to design.  A contemporary Honda's subtle ergonomic design makes Mazda look and feel like the backward country cousin.

Overall I'd say it's ok, but if you can afford better (Honda/Acura/Toyota), do it!  If you commute, buy something with a cup holder.
