            I've owned several high end convertibles, and the Mercedes Benz SLK 320 is by far the best all around convertible on the market today. It's power top gives it the rigidity of a coupe when up along with the convenience of a               glass rear window with defroster (BMW still puts a substandard plastic one in the Z3). With the top up, it also                                  has a usable amount of trunk space, again unlike the Z3 which can only hold about a briefcase-size item whether the top is up or down. The SLK takes less than 30 seconds to go from coupe to convertible at the touch of a button. With the top down it is just as much fun as a Z3 due to its robust 3.2 liter powerplant that puts out 215 horsepower, even the tamer SLK 230 is plenty fast. With the 6-speed manual transmission it is just as fast, if not faster than the Z3 3.0 (I've driven both). The AMG sport package adds a firmer suspension that definitely makes it even more fun to drive.  Best of all, the SLK is as classy as any other Mercedes-Benz and far more rare than any BMW. My SLK 320 still turns plenty of headsï¿½ but I'm waiting for the AMG SLK 32 to come out next year, which will boast 349 hp and dust everything including the new BMW M Roadster.
