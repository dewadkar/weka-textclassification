            I recently took possession of a 2000 Boxster. I�d be lying if I said that the ~5 months of waiting wasn�t painful. Now that I've made it through the 1,000 mile break-in period, the fun is starting to begin!

Ordering Process:
Many (most?) people custom order their Boxster and have it built to their spec by the factory. There are &gt;100 options to choose from ranging from interior and exterior colors to heated seats to a stiffer sports suspension. After placing the initial order for your vehicle, you will typically have some time to change your mind.

I found the online resource: Porsche Pete�s Boxster Board at: http://www.986board.com/board/986board.htm to be an invaluable resource. This web site is an online community of Boxster owners. They will answer your questions about options, share pictures, driving experiences, and their opinions. Someone on the board had prepared an Excel spreadsheet that contains all of the Boxster options and its costs. This was an invaluable tool in selecting different option configurations.

Performance:
The 2000 Boxster has received an engine upgrade from 2.5L to 2.7L. The Boxster S has a 3.2L engine. Like wine, the Boxster�s performance is reputed to improve with age. Many Boxster owners report that their cars perform better after 10-20K miles. My previous vehicle as a 1997 Eclipse GSX. Overall, the vehicles seem to be similar in performance. The engine is wonderful at high RPM. I often forget to shift into 5th gear even when driving at 80mph on the freeway.

Driving Experience:
The ride is extremely refined. The engine is relatively quiet. I love the suspension on the car. I've never driven the 030 sports suspension. Perhaps it is even better? I've had the pleasure of taking the car up to 130MPH (top up). The ride was very smooth even at this speed. This vehicle makes you want to take road trips.

Shifting:
I LOVE the gearbox on the Boxster. All I can say is that shifting feels incredibly natural.

Brakes:
The brakes on the Boxster are superb. The Boxster S has an even more advanced braking system. 

Interior:
Compared to luxury cars, the Boxster�s interior is sparse. I selected a partial black leather interior with aluminum gauges and the aluminum emergency brake and shifter. I love how it looks. Now standard on 2000 models are silver interior door handles. 

Stereo:
Even with the �Hi-Fi� option, the Boxster�s stereo is weak. The head unit�s user interface is poor. Even non-audiophiles may wish to invest in a third party stereo system. Even if you intend on upgrading the Boxster�s stereo system, you should still order the Hi-Fi as this should make it easier for your audio specialist to install a �real� system. 

Storage:
While no roadster is practical, the Boxster has a reasonable amount of storage capacity in the front and rear trunks as well as a number of interior compartments.

My options:
Heated Seats � even though I live in southern California, I selected this option based upon Internet recommendations. I strongly advise its purchase. The heated seats make driving with the top down in the evening much more pleasant. A number of people have opined that it is the best option for the $.

Litronics lighting � these gas powered lights with the leveling system add both style and incredible night time visibility to the car. Once you get used to them, there is no going back to normal headlights.

17� wheels � get them.

P09 � The sports package is a must have. It adds all the features which should be standard (windstop, Hi-Fi stereo, cruise control, alarm, etc)

Pictures:
I have put some pictures of my exterior (Slate Grey Metallic) and interior options up on my web site: http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~ivl/photos/boxster/
