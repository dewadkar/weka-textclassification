            If you're the type who likes to attend car shows and check out the latest potential vehicle models, then you probably enjoy the anticipation that a new line of car or truck can bring. It's always fun to sit back and wait for the new vehicle models to arrive at the dealerships. What will they look like? What new options will be available? What interesting and unique styles will they dream up? 

One 2003 vehicle that's somewhat interesting and that's being delivered for the first time is the <b>Pontiac Vibe</b>, a vehicle that looks like a cross between a station wagon and an SUV. This is Pontiac's only new vehicle for the 2003 model year, joining the lineup that presently includes cars like the Grand Am, Bonneville, and Grand Prix. 

<b>Features of the Vibe:</b>

Pontiac's Vibe comes in three different trim levels: Base, All Wheel Drive (AWD), and GT. Some of the standard features that are available on all Vibes include airbags, 4 cylinders, independant suspension, electronic fuel injection, bucket seats, AM/FM radio with CD player, solar tinted glass, tilt steering wheel, rear window defogger, two 12 volt power outlets (one in front, and one in the center console), air conditioning, and a few others.

Optional equipment includes moonroof, power locks with remote keyless entry, 6- disc in- dash CD player, DVD based navigation system, alarm system, glass breakage sensor, fuel system shutoff, engine block heater, side- impact airbags, etc. This options are available on all three trim levels. 

<b>Dimensions and Other Specifications:</b>

The head room inside the Vibe is 40.6 inches in the front, and 39.8 in the rear. Leg room is 41.8 inches in the front and 35.4 in the rear. The cargo capacity is 19.3 cubic feet (or 54.1 cubic feet, with the rear seats folded down)and the total passenger volume is 111.5 cubic feet.  

Total length of Vibe is 14 feet, 3.9 inches. The width is 5 feet, 9.9 inches and the height is 5 feet, 2.2 inches. The fuel capacity is 13.2 gallons with the base or GT model, and 11.9 gallons with the AWD trim. 

Vibe comes with a 1.8 liter engine that produces 123 horsepower in the AWD, 130 in the base model, and 180 in the GT model. If you want automatic transmission, you can only get it with either the base or AWD. The GT is available only  with 6-speed manual transmission. 

<b>Final Thoughts:</b>

As I stated above, the Vibe is an interesting vehicle that looks like a cross between a station wagon and an SUV. It doesn't have as much rear cargo space as either a wagon or an SUV, but it's more stylish than a station wagon and more economical than an SUV. 

One thing that surprised me right away was the amount of head space available in this vehicle. Considering how dinky it looks from the outside, I was expecting a much tighter squeeze on the inside. It was actually very comfortable. The rear seat can hold up to three passengers, but I think it's really designed for two. It would make for quite an irritating ride with three passengers bunched up in the rear seat. 

I had read some slightly negative reviews on the handling of the Vibe, but I found them to be unwarranted. I drove the base model, with automatic transmission. The steering was quick and smooth, and the fact that the height is a little lower than an SUV makes turning a breeze. I didn't get that "tipping" sensation like I often get when I drive an SUV or a van. 

I like the interior of the Vibe, both for its stylish appearance and for the additional gadgets that are available. There are two electrical outlets and a DVD- based navigation system. This navigation system uses global positioning satellites to show you exactly where you are, in the United States. An actual map pops up, right on the display, indicating where you are, what interstate highways are nearby, etc. 

The lighting on the dash is red, with a black background, with guages that display the speed, RPM, fuel, and engine temperature. There's also a digital display that indicates the outside temperature. I found the red lights to be a little hard on the eyes, but they add to the stylishness of the interior. 

Now, let's talk about the bad points of the Vibe. The number one strike against this vehicle is the low horsepower, which ranges from 123 to 180. At these levels, the Vibe is sure to disappoint those who enjoy a fast set of wheels. Only the GT model has a decent amount of power, and it's only available with standard transmission. So, unless you're willing to shift gears while you drive, the best you will be able to get, in terms of power, is 130 horses, which is pathetic. 

Another bad point is the limited cargo space. If you want a vehicle that has lots of room for storage and for hauling, then you will probably want to pass on the Vibe. The storage space in the back is small- only 19.3 cubic feet. Lowering the rear seats does help increase the capacity (to 54.1 cubic feet), but it doesn't come even close to the large SUV's. Fuel capacity is minimal, too, with a tank that holds only 13.2 gallons (11.9 in the AWD). Of course, the fuel economy of Vibe is very good (27 to 36 mpg) so you shouldn't  need to make many stops for refueling, anyway. Still, I prefer a little larger gasoline tank. 

Vibe comes in an assortment of eight different colors. In order to keep the vehicle sounding cool, Pontiac decided to use creative descriptions, like Salsa (darker red), Satellite (gray), Neptune (blue), Lava (brighter red), Shadow (dark green), Frosty (white), Abyss (black), and Envy (yellow- green). The colors are pretty ordinary, in spite of their catchy titles. The exception would be the Envy, with its mixture of yellow and green. This one will likely turn a few heads, but the others are pretty standard.

Overall, Pontiac Vibe is a decent vehicle. I'm not quite as enthusiastic about it as some other people have been. Maybe people are excited because the field of new vehicles is so limited in 2003 that anything new and different seems more exciting than it really is. 

With a list price under $20,000 (and that includes a few additional options), Pontiac Vibe will likely do well this year in terms of sales volume, increasing the commissions of many hard- working salesmen. In a year of limited new- product offerings, the Vibe is likely to get more attention that it otherwise deserves. It's a decent vehicle, and it could be made better if the engineers at Pontiac would make a few changes. Perhaps with the 2004 model, Vibe will be revved up with more power and a little more room. Until then, I recommend Vibe only to those who want an economical vehicle and who don't mind the slow acceleration. 

I'm hoping for better Pontiac vibrations next year.
