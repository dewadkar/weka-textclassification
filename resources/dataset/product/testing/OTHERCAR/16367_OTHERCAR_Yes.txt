            The HP 200 digital camera is a great buy for the money.  The picture quality is clear and detailed, and as a first time digital camera user I found it to be very easy to operate and download. However there are some drawbacks to this camera. The first thing I noticed is that is seems to take a very long time to download the pictures to your computer. It is also impossible for me to find an a/c adapter for the camera in my area, which is a necessity if you take a lot of pictures because the 4-AA batteries drain very fast. I have noticed that if you take as few as 12 pictures and download them without an adapter they batteries are dead. I believe this is a problem with all digital cameras and not just HP models. However I believe that the accessories should be easier to find in local retailer, or should come with the camera. Overall though, I have to say that I feel like a got a great camera for the money spent, and I am happy with it.<br><br>
