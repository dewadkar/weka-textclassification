            I bought this unit about 2 years ago.  It caught my eye because it had many features to offer at a low price.  It comes with 4mb of memory which can handle up to 100 VGA images.  It also has a focus options that enables you to view images that are only 1cm away from the camera.  It comes with a video cable for TV output and a serial cable attachment.  Its pictures were quite impressive even with the lowest resolution setting.  It also has a built-in macro feature that enables you to adjust lighting in areas where there is not enough light.  It takes 4 AA bateries to power up this camera which i think is quite a bit of bateries but they last quite long. Overall, the Ricoh RDC-300 is a excellently valued camera with features of higher end models incorporated in it.   <br><br>
