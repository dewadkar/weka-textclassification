            I thought a car with this engine (V-6, 170hp) at this price was a steel. Well it was......steeling me blind!

The day after I took her off of the lot, the driver's side window molding popped off. Back to the dealer. This should have been a wake up call...

I have had at least 4 recall notices for various things (2 times for the brakes alone). The trunk seldom opens (unless at the dealer, of course) unless you physically stand behind the car and press the trunk button about 7 times and grab the trunk as soon as you hear "pop."

The starter/engine light came on within 1 year. Even with Mercury's road side assistance, they refused to tow the car to the dealer since the car was still running. Yes, but with this light on, as anyone with ANY intelligence about cars would know, it soon may not be running and I (female) would be stranded somewhere on the side of the road.

The car shakes at 70 mph like someone going through withdrawl. This car should be able to handle 120 mph let alone 70!

One of the fluid lights came on. Back to the dealer. Just a lose clamp or something. Oh, that's all?

I just had my brakes replaced at 25,000 miles. My mechanic said this is a little soon....should last until 35k or so (even with harsh driving). He knows I hate this car and offered up that he heard Mercury will be issuing another recall. This one for the emergency brake - you know, the one that never holds the car in place. And this recall is probably why my brakes went out so fast. No emergency brake to hold the car, so the regular brakes do much more work. Straight from the mechanic to you.

This car has the most uncomfortable seats of anything I have ridden (including horseback!!) I purchased seat covers to help, but that does not help the back pain after a 2 hour trip.

The paint job is tacky. I have chips everywhere and the car has little shine even after a professional waxing. 

I am running out of room and patience, so I'll leave with one more. Even if the car has all of these problems, at least I can drown out the noises with a good stereo, right? WRONG! Left speaker only works occasionally.

I will be going back to Japanese.

P.S. Did I mention I needed 2 new front tires after less than 15,000 miles? Ford and Firestone - a lovely couple
