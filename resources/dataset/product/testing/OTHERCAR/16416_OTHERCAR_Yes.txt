            The main reason we first looked the Nikon Coolpix 775 was because it was so SMALL. Simple as it. Most digital cameras are so bulky and heavy. This camera looks sleek and smart and really can be accessory!!!. It fits into most pockets and is very easy to carry around. I mean everyone who has seen this says WOW as soon as they see it. I mean my friends have liked it even before they checked out the pictures. Not many cameras can achieve that.

Before you just think its a beauty with no brains, let me first discuss the PLUS points. The camera costs only around $350 now and is really a bargain for the quality it gives and the NIKON brand name. Most Nikon cameras are $600+ and for our budget ($400-500) we were very glad to get a Nikon. It is basically a point and shoot camera and for starters-intermediate the features are excellent.

The key features are:

- Battery and charger come included. Most other cameras require you to buy the charger. I have easily managed with one battery so far.
- There are several settings that give the best picture for the lighting that you have.
- The 8MB compact flash card gives you around 37 pictures in the medium setting. We have managed without additional memory for 2 months now but it might be better to get extra memory. We have taken over 500 pictures but transfer it immediately.
- The transfer process is immediate and truly just involved pressing a button. It is extremely easy.
- It has a 3X Optical zoom which is really awesome, because quite frankly the 2.5 digital zoom is hardly used. Cameras with just digital zoom are hardly good.

Price:

As I said, the price is excellent. Today you can get it for $340 and for this price the camera is a steal. The Nikon quality is outstanding. We also purchased a protection plan from Best Buy for 50 bucks, so we do hope to keep this camera for a while.

Cons:

One con as I said is that the night pictures are not as good as the day pictures. It good but not outstanding and may be a concern for some. Also it is not a camera for professional users. It is only a 2.1 Megapixel camera and really cannot be as good as 3+ megapixel. If you are willing to shell out a little more, you should buy a Nikon Coolpix 995. 

All in all , I think its a great buy. The reason I gave it a 4 star was because of the night pictures, which matter a lot to me. If you don't really care, then you should be fine. For the price, it is really worth the money and win you a lot of friends with its sleek appearance.
