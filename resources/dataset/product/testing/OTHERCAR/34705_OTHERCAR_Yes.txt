            I own a 98 Hyundai Sonata, and I think its a great car.  Hyundai's have probably the best warranties around, although they didn't start the 100,000 mile warranty until 99.  I owned a Honda Accord before the Hyundai and my Sonata is every bit as nice, but cost thousands less.
The Sonata is a V6 and has lots of pickup.  The interior is very comfortable, and the controls are very accessible.  
Another great thing about Hyundai's is the dealerships.  I bought an Elantra in Florida in 93 and the Sonata in Texas last year, and these two dealerships were the most helpful, informed, and not pushy car salesmen that I have ever dealt with.  (I've I dealt with a lot)  I don't know if it is a coincidence that they were both Hyundai dealers.
If you are a music lover, the standard speakers in the Sonata were a little cheap.  You might want to go with an upgrade on the stereo speaker or switch them out yourself after you buy the car but other than that I am very happy with my car.<br><br>
