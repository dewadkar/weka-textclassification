            We have a Plymouth Voyager for four years and 80k miles, this past summer we looked for a replacement.  We went out and drove all of them.  The Toyota and Mazda were nice but a little on the small size.  When we go on vacation we take lots of stuff and packed our Plymouth to the max.  Everything we read about the Honda was positive and we really liked it when we finally found a dealer who had one we could drive.  We ordered an EX and were told it would take 5-6 months to come in.  4 weeks later we got a call that it was in.  We were sure surprised.  The dealer was easy to work with and we even got it at $500 under sticker price.  It now has 13k miles and has had absolutely no problems.  We have taken it on 3 1,000+ mile trips and it was a real pleasure.  The folding 3rd seat is real nice after having to remove the one in our Plymouth.  And when the seat is up there is a nice cargo compartment in the floor that works well for keeping things from shifting around.  We put the Honda cargo tray accessory in there to keep the carpet clean and now it is easy to go pick up mulch, sporting goods, and other stuff without having to worry about spills.  I change my own oil and the Honda is a piece of cake, the oil filter can be accessed through the passenger front wheel well.  Lots of power, real nice climate control sytem, good mileage (just got 25 mpg on our latest trip), and no problems.  What more could I ask for?  How about a better sound system and leather interior?
