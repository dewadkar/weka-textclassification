            This summer I have been driving my brother's Caravan a lot back and forth to our beach rental.  When you need to transport a lot of stuff in a weekend, (especially when you have two kids), you will appreciate the room that a Mini-Van has over most of the SUVs on the road today.

The 1998 Dodge Caravan is available in four models: (Base), SE, Sport and LE.  My brother�s company leased Caravan is the LE Model.  Basically on a leased car, they�re not going to let you beat up a loaded sports edition.  Companies expect wear and tear, so they provide you with the bare bones with maybe some creature comforts like Air and Stereo if your lucky.  

<b>Room with a View:</b>

Still the Van has a lot to offer.   It�s not as large as the Grand Caravan, about a foot and � shorter, but there is still plenty of room to pack away stuff when your traveling.  

This is a 3 door Van with a hatch in the rear.  The third door is a left-side sliding door and is standard on all Caravan models except the base model.  The van has two front bucket seats (captains chairs) with retractable armrests.  A removable short middle bench that seat two adults comfortable but you can squeeze three if necessary and a full length removable bench in the rear.

When you need to take a lot of cargo, you will remove the rear bench and use the LARGE space for packing up for your trips.  The caveat here is that it is difficult to unhook and remove the heavy seat.  Two people recommended here.  (If you want easy, go with the Honda Odyssey). 

<b>The powers that be:</b>

The LE model is equipped with a moderately powerful 6 Cylinder, 3.3 Liter, 158 Horsepower engine.  If you move up to the SE or Sport model you can get the 3.8 Liter, 180 Horsepower engine.

The LE model still had Power Steering a cassette stereo with 6 speakers and air conditioning.  But lacked some of the other nice extras like power windows, adjustable seats..etc.  If you want those move up to the SE model. Of course that is going to cost you a couple extra grand.
Yes it has a two cup holders�


<b>The Drive:</b>

I was pleasantly surprised the first time I actually drove the Minivan.  I thought the drive would be extremely stiff and I would feel like I was driving a bus down the freeway.  But In actuality, It handled just like my Jeep Grand Cherokee.  The Power steering made me feel like I was in any other car.  The large windows and mirror placement gave me little trouble in seeing everyone else that was on the road behind and around the Caravan.


<b>Conclusion:</b>  Yes, I was one of those people that said I would never buy a minivan.  But after two kids, I�m starting to reconsider.  My next car will definitely be a minivan.  Once you load both kids in the Jeep, there is very little room for anything else.  And don�t get me started on the car pool situation I have to look forward to either.
