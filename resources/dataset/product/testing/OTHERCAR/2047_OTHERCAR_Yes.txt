                 Today my father and I went up to Central Cadillac in Cleveland, OH looking for 2000 Cadillac Seville.  As we strolled the parking this amazingly beautiful car struck our eyes.  A dark red 1997 Cadillac STS was sitting in front of us.  I asked about it, but my dad wasn't interested because he does not buy used cars.  After the salesman gave his pitch and took us for a test drive not only was I in love but my father was too.  After the test drive papers were signed right away and I was off in my new car!  

     After one night of driving the car around town I realized this is one of the smoothest rides I have ever driven in before.  Adding to the enjoyment of the ride is the BOSE stereo system with 12 disk CD player, hands free cell phone included in the car, the 300 horsepower, Onstar navigational system, and cup holders!!!  

     Not only is the ride amazing but it fits 3 easily in the back seat making it easy to drive around my friends without any complaining.  The optional TV in the back of the driver's and passenger's head rests makes the back seat more enjoyable then it has ever been.  After learning about my car I decided to have some fun with it.  

     After taking a trip to a local discount auto part store the 4 mufflers now have chrome tips, and the gear shift knob has a Florida State University cover.  Many more things can be added to the car.  After I get done working this summer I will be putting in 4 12&quot; JBL subwoofers with 240 watt amp! This is a great car for old and especially young due to the sleek style, and look it gives.<br><br>
