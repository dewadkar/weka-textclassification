            This is one of the best cars ever built for the road. My first car was a '91 Integra RS, it runs great and requires little maintenance.  I love the over-all design of the car and the way that it seems to stand out in a crowd. The only problem that I encountered with this car was not replacing the timing belt soon enough which was quite an expense.  The fuel economy is unbelievable and the room and comfort is outstanding.  I would recommend this car to anyone.  In fact, I loved my '91 so much I recently bought a '90 GS.  It only gets better, when I bought the car it had 170,000 miles, today it is still running great and all I can do is praise the GS for all the added features that my RS lacks.  I would recommend the 5 speed instead of the automatic due to the drastic loss of power.  I also own a 1998 Mustang GT and I my '91 5spd will out run it any day of the week. These cars are full of suprizes and will win your heart and keep your wallet happy.  This I a great car and definatly the most fun to drive!<br><br>
