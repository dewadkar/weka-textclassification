            Here's the deal, think of the cars in the same class as the Maxima.  What do we have?  Toyota Camry, Honda Accord, Ford Taurus/Sable.  None of these cars comes close in terms of the price/performance, price/value ratio.  I got my 2000 GXE with 16 inch alloys, premium sound (w/CD), power drivers seat, and a security system for a little under $21,000!  Like the Taurus/Sable and Camry, this car can be considered a family sedan, but boy, it burns both these cars in terms of performance with it's 220 horses.  It's a "sporty" alternative to the Ford or the Toyota with a lot more style and character (an argument can be made for the new Taurus, it looks very sharp).  Compared to the Honda, it's a pretty even match in terms of value and performance.  However, the Accord is...well, "cookie-cutter" when compared to the Maxima.

The inside of the car is spacious to say the least.  The view from the front passenger side of the car is spectacular.  The rear seats also provide ample space for 2 or 3 adults.

The only real problem with the Maxima is the fuel economy.  I think I'm getting about 16 miles/gallon!  This is a big difference from my previous car, a 98 Sentra which gave me a consistent 30mpg.

All in all, this car is for the family man who still wants to have a little fun after he drops the kids off at school or soccer practice.  Also great for college grads looking to start a family.  Actually, it's an awesome car no matter how you look at it.  Great performance, distinctive style, and lots of room.
