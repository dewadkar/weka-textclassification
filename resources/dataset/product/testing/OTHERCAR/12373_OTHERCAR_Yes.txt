            This is a good car to have and I have like it ever since I bought it.  So far I have had no problems with it.  I would recommend this car to anyone.  I also have two 10 in subs in my car that put out some good bass but it could use some work.  If you are looking for a car to have good bass then I would consider another car because the back seats block a lot of the bass.  Other than that I like it.  <br><br>
