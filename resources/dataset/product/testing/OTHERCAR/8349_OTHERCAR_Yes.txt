            I've had this camera for a couple of months now.  I've taken a couple of hundred pictures with it and gotten some really good ones.  If you are expecting a $300 megapixel camera for this price, well wake up, because this ain't it!  If you are a person with some common sense who wants to be able to email pictures to your friends, this one will do the trick. 
 
It is difficult to compare this one with other cameras on the market, because this one doesn't have the newest technology(hence the extremely low price).  One thing is for sure; the lack of an LCD screen definitely helps the Largan conserve batteries.

Not great for flash photography(but OK); I mostly use mine for outdoor pictures.  You may view an example of a typical picture at:

The retail box comes with everything you need to use it(and more).  I have a friend with a really expensive camera and his didn't even come with the A/C adapter, but the Largan does.  It uses CR123A batteries which are very expensive at the supermarket, but are fairly easy to find dirt-cheap on the internet.  

The 2 meg memory is enough for about 30 VGA-quality pictures.  Try to get it with the Adobe software; it's very easy to use and powerful.  The biggest drawback of that software is that it expands the files tenfold, so it sometimes slows down the computer.  I love my camera and take it everywhere.  I constantly send pictures to my family.
