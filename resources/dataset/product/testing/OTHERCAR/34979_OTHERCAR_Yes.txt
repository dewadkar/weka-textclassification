               While test driving several makes and models of cars this past year, I thought I would go crazy! But, I found the Buick Century...what a car! I knew I wanted a mid-sized car because i was tired of trying to remove my 18 month old son from the back of our compact. And I drove several. But as soon as I got out on the road with the Buick Century, I knew I had found the perfect car!
  The Century drives as smooth as silk. It handles like a smaller car, but is roomy and comfortable. There are tons of options and a variety of colors to choose from. I chose the classy Silver. And at $20,000.00, it was a great buy!
  Standard equipment includes heat/air, electric windows, electric driver seat, driver and passenger side airbags, am/fm radio, cassette player, cd player, anti-lock brakes, cruise control, intermittent windshield wipers, remote lock/unlock, remote trunk, remote alarm, and (this is what i really like) you can set the lights to come on and go off automatically. I have trouble with leaving the lights on, so this has helped me out a lot! And of course there are all the technical things that come standard that I don't really understand, but I have over 6,000 miles on it now, and I have not had any trouble at all with it. Great gas mileage for a mid-sized car, too! Takes about $15.00 to fill her up, and lasts a long time!
  I know this does not sound very professional, but I am not a pro. I just wanted everyone to know how great the Buick Century is. I would recommend it to anyone. My mother just got a used one, a 1984, and hers is wonderful too! <br><br>
