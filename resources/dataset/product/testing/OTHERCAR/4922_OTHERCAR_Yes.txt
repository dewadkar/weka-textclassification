            I bought this vehicle for two reasons: style and capability. 

First of all, there is just something about a pickup truck that sets you apart from others on the road. Especially when, like me, you have Texas plates and a Stetson. However, this truck is not only for those of us who prefer country music. The looks of the truck are good enough to be seen in more formal situations. Besides, what is better than having that special someone right there next to you in the bench seat instead of across the vehicle in a bucket? I know my girlfriend loves that option, and the feeling is mutual. In short, the Ram works well in any situation from backed up to a campfire to parked with friends before the game to a night on the town.

Dodge did more than just make the truck look nice though. My Ram has the 5.2L V8 engine, the smaller of the two Magnum V8's (5.9L being the larger one), and I can haul as much as I can cram in the back, plus a full payload of stuff (or friends) in the cab. The engine, however, is not all torque. It can outrun most other vehicles on the road, if you are more the racing type.

One aspect of trucks that many people who do not own them hate is their size. This allows the Ram owner to drive with authority, because the height alone will protect the driver from many accidents. However, that same height makes it somewhat dangerous for those driving Geo's, etc. I prefer to have the safety of being protected from the other drivers on the road, because I am confident in my driving abilities, but it is something that one should consider before purchase.

Having the Laramie SLT Quad Cab package is a nice addition to a great truck. I have four doors, leather bench seats front and rear, CD player, onboard computer for calculations like Miles per Gallon (MPG), Distance to Empty (DTE), trip length in both time and distance, plus an outside thermometer and compass (all in both English and Metric units), large storage area under the rear seat, and a storage unit/arm rest in the middle of the front bench.

The biggest complaint I have against the Ram I now own is that I do not get very good MPG. Somewhere between 11.5-14.5 in the city, and 17.5-21.5 on the highway, but usually on the lower end of those spectrums. Also, a little more legroom in the rear area would probably be nice. The only other complaint, is not really aimed at the truck. I spend much of my time driving ina and around Annapolis, Maryland, and as such, encounter many roads that were built around the time of horse-and-buggy transportation. The Ram is just too big to safely drive down some of these roads, and many others must be driven with caution.

If you are used to driving a car, then you will either love or hate the Ram. The height gives you much improved visibility on everything except the first foot or so in front and behind your bumpers (front and back that is). Also, the extra length of the truck will take a little getting used to, and will be punctuated by the occasional bumped curb on right turns. However, soon you wil learn to enjoy the truck, which I have found to be just a s responsive as any car I have driven.

If you are the kind who loves 4-cylinders, high MPG, and being low to teh ground, avoid this truck. If you like a little (or a lot of) power under your hood, the improved visibility and safety that comes with height, and do not mind spending a little extra on gas to have the look and capability of the finest pickup on the road, this is the truck for you.<br><br>
