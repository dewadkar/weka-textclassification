            I have worked with digital cameras before at work, but when I wanted a personal one for casual pictures, I didn't want to spend too much, so I started researching for digital cameras under $300. My main considerations were price (of course), picture quality, size, features, and proven brand name. And all of this pointed to the Olympus Camedia Brio D-100. 

When I first took it out of the box, I was impressed by its small size, light weight and slick design. From the front, you couldn't tell if it was digital, it looked like a regular 35mm. The D-100 is even smaller than my Canon film camera. From it's backside, the 1.5 inch LCD display gives it away.

From my first test shots and fiddling around, I saw the picture quality was extremely sharp especially in SHQ mode. The camera automatically arranges the settings for almost any light condition and even adjusts the color balance quite nicely. I was a little disappointed in the auto flash that seemed to overexpose the image when shooting indoors or using macro mode (close up). Outdoor shots and medium to long range shots turned out very good and colorful. If you are not too demanding, and just need a point-and-shoot camera, the D-100 is the camera for you.

The menu system is a little confusing at first. The D-100 uses picture icons rather than descriptions or initials (except for the resolution modes). And some are really hard to understand and you need look up the "legend" in the guide book, but once you know, it is a simple to use.

The 2x digital zoom is not too clear. When you have it on zoom mode, the target image seems fuzzy. Another negative aspect that I learned about and experienced myself is it's power hungry nature. Since I have anticipated this from the start, I have already purchased rechargeable NiMH batteries, and this camera drains them after about 48 shots (using the LCD). So I suggest than anybody interested in the D-100, should use rechargeable batteries.

But the good points outweigh the negatives. I especially liked the USB port and the plug-and-play interface. I am using Windows ME, so I didn't even have to use any software. The OS immediately recognized the camera and uploading images is almost as fast as accessing a zip drive or CD-ROM. The OS treats the camera like an extra hard drive, so you could copy and erase files from the camera to a folder in your hard disk. The relatively accurate viewfinder is also nice to have. And makes me feel like I am using a normal film camera. Using the 8MB card (included) to store images, you could save up to 24 images in standard HQ mode, also like a film camera.

As a conclusion, this camera suits people who want a high-quality budget camera with many advanced features. This camera may also be the perfect replacement for your film camera, now that several online services offers digital film printing. Compared to others in the same price range, I would say this is the best.
