            The first Passat was introduced in 1974 and marked a radical departure for Volkswagen cars.  It was front-wheel drive, as opposed to rear-wheel drive, and was powered by a water-cooled engine as opposed to an air-cooled engine.  By the way, the name "Passat" refers to a European wind.

<b>EXTERIOR</b>: The Passat is no ordinary sedan.  Eye-catching and stylish pretty much sums up it up.  It took years before the Nissan and Honda to develop stylish "mainstream" cars (i.e. the Altima and Accord respectively), and even Ford with its Taurus has a LONG way to go.  Even the smallest available wheels (15-inch alloys on 195/65HR tires) look appropriate for the Passat.

<b>INTERIOR</b>: The turbocharged 4-cylinder engine in my test Passat is VERY muted.  The only noticeable noise you hear at full throttle (besides the engine) is a small trace of turbo whine.  At around 3,500-4,500 rpm, exhaust boom becomes noticeable, but is not loud enough to annoy me.  The Passat's shape is not only pleasing to the eye, it also provides a rather low resistance to the wind.  This explains the unusually quiet ride that I thought only could be found on a Lexus or a Mercedes-Benz!

The interior is very ergonomic.  The controls are easy enough to understand without having to use the owners manual.  The HVAC controls, however, are inconveniently placed low on the dashboard forcing me to either fumble around with the controls or take my eyes off the road.  Automatic climate control is available on the V6 model, but my tester did not have this feature.

The interior materials in my test Passat just screamed of luxury and quality.  Typical of a German manufacturer, but Volkswagen?  I found it quite hard to believe I was actually sitting in one.  Despite the luxury, the interior is mostly black, giving it a stark, "<b>IN YOUR FACE</b>" feel that I like best in a sports car, NOT a luxury car.

Inside, there was a lot more headroom than I had anticipated.  This is probably due to the fact that my test model had no sunroof.  The front seats are very comfortable, good lateral support.  My tester came with the standard cloth upholstery.  In the rear, the seats are firm, yet comfortable too, but feel a little more upright than the front.  The Passat holds about 15 cubic feet of cargo space, more than enough for the average driver.

<b>ENGINE</b>:  My test GLS is powered by a 1.8-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine.  It produces 150 horsepower at 5,800 rpm, and 162 lb./ft. of torque at a low 2,200 rpm.  It is mated to a 5-speed "Tiptronic" automatic transmission and sends power to the front wheels.  Despite the fact that the Passat is turbocharged, with 3,236 pounds (or more) to "lug" around, it just does not feel powerful enough.  

Around town, there is just enough torque to keep up with traffic but has nothing to spare.  Even at full throttle, the engine struggles to keep pace with traffic on uphills.  Liberal use of the Tiptronic seems to add a bit of pep to the cars acceleration, but that could be just a mental thing too!  On the highway, assuming its relatively flat, the Passat feels only adequate at best.  If I were to buy a Passat GLS, I would probably stick to a 5-speed MANUAL transmission.  There is more powerful V6 model, though, and for 2002 you can buy the new W8 model which should provide a MUCH better overall driving experience.  Expect to pay about $40,000 for a W8.

<b>HANDLING</b>: Even with the smallish all-season tires on, the Passat still corners great.  There is a little bit of body lean in the corners but is expected.  I find the steering wheel to be very responsive to my inputs and steering feel is nothing short of perfect.  The brakes are impressively strong too!

<b>RIDE</b>: Volkswagen has done an excellent job acheiving the perfect balance between a comfortable freeway ride, and sporty handling.  Though the suspension is a bit firm, I never felt any jiggle or bounce when riding over dips and mounds on the road.

<b>RELAIBILITY</b>: I noticed a "crunching" noise when making right turns at low speeds.  The owner of the vehicle noticed the same problem too, but said at the time, it was not severe.  A trip to the local mechanic revealed a problem with the upper control arm.  Unfortunately, with 68,000 miles on the odometer, the owner was left with a bill as the warranty stopped at 60,000 miles.  I have yet to find out how much it costs, but will update this review as soon as I get the rest of the information.

As far as recalls are concerned, <b>4</b> were issued so far.  For more information check out:

<b>VALUE</b>: Though the Passat with the turbo-4/automatic combination fails to inspire performance-wise, all Passats are elegant, sporty sedans and wagons.  They provide more luxury amenities and style usually found in more expensive cars which explains its rather high price compared to its competitors.  A 1998 Passat GLS 1.8T in excellent condition could sell for upwards of $15,000.
