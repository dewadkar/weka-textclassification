            Since my friends often leave their vehicles with me when they go out of town, I get the pleasure of driving them for a while and get to experience the feel of ownership, even if it is for a short period of time. Recently, my friend dropped off his 2000 Nissan Pathfinder SE with us. After twenty days and some 500 miles, &quot;I was totally smitten&quot;. 

I always thought that the Toyota 4Runner is the best, long lasting SUV in its class and probably I will continue to believe so. The main concern with 4Runner, for that matter, with any other SUVs, is that the ride is bumpy. Mind you, I own a Lexus as well as an Accord, so smooth quiet ride is one of my priorities. I was so surprised that this vehicle could easily be comparable to an RX300. It hardly had a truck like ride. My wife always complains that she finds sitting at the back seats of a 4Runner to be a total pain. She thought all SUVs were like that, until we test drove the new Acura MDX (I sincerely hope that Epinions will soon add that vehicle with the line of other Acura automobiles, so that I can write an opinion on that). We drove the MDX the day it came out as we got an invitation from Acura to test drive it. We went to Goodson Acura. 

Well, back to the Pathfinder, the interior seemed quite spacious (for my size) and we were able to fit four suitcases, two large boxes as well as my friend, his wife and daughter. 

I liked the white dials that reversed at night. The Bose stereo sounded exceptionally well for a factory stereo. 

The engine had plenty of power and considering the weight of the car, the acceleration was good enough.

I found the wet traction to be better than that of a Honda Passport but I wish it had traction control. There were times when the truck fish tailed on wet pavements. That is probably normal for an SUVs but all wheel drive / traction control could have improved the situation a lot more.

I compared our seat height every time I was at a red light and found that we were sitting equally high to most of the other SUVs standing beside us, if not higher. 

I loved this SUV. Anyone in the market for a moderately priced, good looking, fairly powerful SUV should definitely go for a test drive.<br><br>
