                   We bought the car because it was cheap, that's the bottem line. We wanted a brand new car in 1994 and the low price on the Topaz was very attractive. Dealing with Ford Credit wasn't that much fun but it's all part of the car buying game, isn't it?
       I love this car because it has been so dependable. For six years we haven't suffered a breakdown. Now, as I say this I must tell you that my husband does the regular maintenance on the car without missing a thing. Sometimes I wonder if people who give these cars junky reviews actually take care of their vehicles over the long run. With appropriate upkeep this 1994 Topaz has been an awesome car to have.
       It's not a fast car or anything fancy. The Topaz is a clean, easy drive. The only problem I have is that the seats aren't as adjustable as I'd like. I'm short and I have to use a pillow under my butt to feel comfortable driving. We have a V6 which to some may seem whimpy but this car has the power our family needs for both city and highway driving.
       If you're looking for a dependable, small family car, the '94 Topaz is for you. If the car has been well cared for the benefits of owning this car will be great. 
       Not for someone looking for luxury. If you have over $20,000 to spend on a car then don't stop here.<br><br>
