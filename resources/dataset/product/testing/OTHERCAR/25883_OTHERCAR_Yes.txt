            My Last Jeep was a Cherokee Pioneer 1985 model, 4 door 6 cylinder 5 speed transmission with towing package..  The Jeep went 310,000 + miles with only one major repair, that was when my X downshifted from 5th to 2nd to pass and blew the clutch to pieces.

Other than that it was totally reliable, burned less than 1 quart of oil per 1000 miles even with over 250,000 on it,  was tight and quiet.  

Jeep has a tradition of building solid transportation, and this one surely held true.  

I do not buy New vehicles, since I let someone else suffer the massive front end depreciation, but I would surely  recommend without qualms, with the caveat of having your mechanic check it over first, any of the older jeeps to anyone that needs a good vehicle for hauling, in town or, on the open road.
