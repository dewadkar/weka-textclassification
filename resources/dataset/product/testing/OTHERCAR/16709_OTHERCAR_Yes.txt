            I recently purchased a 2000 Chrysler Cirrus LX. I needed a car to primarily transport my wife and I to work every day, a distance of 65 km one way. To me, comfort is a priority. I'm a tall guy (6'1), and I needed a car with some room. The Cirrus has plenty of leg and head room. My mother-in-law was raving about how comfortable the back seat was, and how roomy it seemed. The rear seats fold down in this car, which proved extremely useful when I had to make a trip to the local lumber store to pick up some wood for a project.

The Cirrus feels and looks like a much more expensive car than it is. Mine is finished in &quot;taupe frost&quot;, and I have heard nothing but praise for it when revealing it to friends for the first time. The cloth interior practical, but stylish. I love the interior ergonomics, especially the dash and console layout. I really appreciate the voluminous center console, with it's useful pen and change holders. 

 The 150 hp 2.4L 4 cylinder engine is peppy with 2 people in the car, but it lags a little when the car is loaded up. Acceleration is good, especially when travelling at highway speeds. The ride is very smooth, and reasonably quiet. I'm averaging about 25 mpg, including both heavy city and highway driving. 

My only quibbles about this vehicle is that the blind spot is a little difficult to see when turning your head. You need to use your mirrors a little more than you would with other cars I've driven. The placement of the battery under the front fender well is a little strange as well.

If you are a person who likes to travel in comfort and style, and doesn't want to break the bank, this is a great car for you. It looks great, drives great, and makes you feel good behind the wheel.
