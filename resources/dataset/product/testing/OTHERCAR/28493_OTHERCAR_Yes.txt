            I finally got the jeep I've wanted for so long.  I picked it up six weeks ago and have not had a single problem so far.  No trips back to the dealer to tweak this or that, no strange noises or behavior.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it continues this way - which it probably will since I bought the maintenance package.  I plan on keeping this beauty for a long time.

The Overland is the top of the line Grand Cherokee and comes with almost everything standard.  There is only a small handful of things that you can add:  tire pressure monitoring system, chrome wheels, engine block heater, and towing package.  The only thing I don't have is the chrome wheels.  No way was I going to pay almost $900 for shiny wheels!

One of the things everyone has commented on when I take them for a ride in my new SUV is how smooth it rides.  I just don't understand why so many of the other reviews say that the Grand Cherokee rides like a truck.  

For the first time in over 20 years I am (sort of) looking forward to winter in Wisconsin.  I bought this jeep as my winter car because of the 4 wheel drive system.  I feel more secure about the idea of driving in the snow already and it's only October!  

I'm recently divorced, so no more husband to clear the 200 foot driveway; and to top it off, he got the snowblower!  I do have a very nice neighbor who will plow me out if the snow really piles up, but I am expecting to "plow through it" on my own most of the time.

Every time I get in, I think to myself, "I love this car!"  Really, I do!  The back seats are very comfortable.  If you have ever had to sit in the back of a Jeep Laredo, there is no comparison.  Whereas the back of the Laredo is awkward to get in and out of, cramped and a bumpy ride, the Grand Cherokee is none of those things.  

The only thing I wish were different were the gas mileage.  I'm getting almost 16 miles per gallon with mostly highway driving.  I spent $28 filling up at a price of $1.51 per gallon.  I had gone just about 300 miles since my last fill-up, which means at current gas prices I spent a bit over 9 cents per mile.  But what "get-up-and-go" this thing has!  When I put my foot down on that gas pedal, the generous 8 cylinder engine really responds.  It is so cool!!!
