            Given the difficulty to find one of these in stock, let alone to be able to test drive one, perhaps this feedback will be useful to those considering one.

It's been over a week now since I took delivery of my new 2001 CLK320.  This, coupled with the 2000 miles my wife and I drove in Europe as part of our European Delivery Program, rounds out our experience with the car so far.  I ordered this car in January 2001 and I took delivery of it in Germany the first week in June.

By the way, the European Delivery Program is a really nice program.  Basically, you pay retail for the car, and MB "gives you" 2 nights free hotel (you have a choice of some really nice hotels), a free lunch (really nice lunch) at the Delivery Center, a factory tour, car insurance while driving in Europe, a full tank of gas (in Europe, that's about $80), and cancels the $600 delivery charge.  If you were planning on going to Europe AND buying a new MB AND willing to pay retail for it, this program my work for you.


The car is simply one of the most beautiful new cars on the road.  Even after being introduced over three years ago, you simply don't find them in masses.  Of course, the ones you do see are probably Brilliant Silver - like mine.  According to MB, 43% of the new cars last year were in Brilliant Silver, their most popular color - followed by their two black colors.

Since the model year 2000, the CLK320 got an improved look made possible by new wheels and side body clading.  It's still no match for the CLK430, but for an additional $7,000, the CLK430 should be better in many respects.

The ride quality is typical European.  A little stiff or firm for the uninitiated, but this is a Mercedes - not a Caddy.  Its relatively quite, but you can definitely feel the rumble of the V6.

The car is fast for a six.  MB claims 0-60 in 6.9 secs.  Its smooth at high speeds (80+ mph).  The "tiptronic" auto transmission is nice to have. Truck space is decent.  It easily fits golf clubs.  One of the back seats fold down for additional space.

The TeleAid service is a nice touch.  It basically, provides any assistance you might need with the car 24/7.  In fact, it even comes with a concierge service for dinner reservations, tee times, etc.  MB provides an 800 number as well so you don't eat up the 30 free minutes of air time they provide for you for making calls in the car itself. By the way, when you first activate the system, you can use the 800 number and save the 10-minutes it takes to do it from the car.

Lastly, the car comes standard with 4 years scheduled maintenance included.  So you don't have to worry about the cost of tune-ups, oil changes, etc. for a while.


The Cons . . .

I know I'm being very picky about some of these faults.  I'm comparing this car to the BMW 5-series I used to have and my wife's Lexus RX-300.  In brief, my 5-series handled much better, with more functionality, and a slightly higher build quality.  Of course, my 5-series had sport suspension and 17" wheels, so perhaps it's not a fair comparison.  The steering feels a little heavy and the handling is no comparison to the 5-series.

Now for the nit-picky stuff, the sunroof switch is not one-touch (the door windows, of course, are).  There's no indicator for the cruise control being on, or for either door being ajar, or for seat-beats being unbuckled.  There's not much interior cargo space - no place to put change without it rattling around as you take corners. The steering wheel has no tilt adjustment.  Even in the most detailed mode, the Navigation system doesn't show street names - only the one that you're on.  The screen is a little small as well.  I'm already hearing small rattles from the rear when going over bumps.  I'm not impressed with the factory radio.

As one would expect, the back seats are tight fitting two adults at most.  In fairness though, they are still usable and better than many other coupes out there.

Perhaps, the worst thing about this car isn't even really about the car itself.  My experience with most MB dealers has been terrible.  Out of 10 salespeople, I could only recommend 2 to friends and family.  I would expect a lot better service - especially paying full retail for the car.  My experience with Lexus, and BMW to a lesser extent, easily outclassed my experience with MB dealers.  There's also the wait factor to consider.  Expect to wait between 4-8 months for a new car.  This will vary at every dealer, so do your homework.

Despite the cons, overall, I still like the car.  For me, the styling of the car makes up for much of the cons.  I have no doubt the next generation clk due out in 2003/4 will address many of these issues - of course, for more $$$$ too.
