            I received the Sony Mavica FD-90 for Christmas this year and I can't believe I waited so long. I love this camera! Having two small children and being an avid scrapbooker, I was forever taking pictures. Film and photo devoloping being one of the biggest things in our family budget. My husband finally decided that having a digital camera would certainly help us to save money in this area. I took the time to "play" with this camera at a local electronics store before purchasing it. The salesperson allowed me to take a few pictures in the store and take the disc home to see if the pictures would be the quality I was looking for. I uploaded the images to one of the websites that do digital images to prints and was very pleased with the quality of my photos.  

I did alot of homework on digital cameras and wanted to make sure I got the camera that I knew I'd like. The Sony Mavica FD-90 was a little more expensive than some of the other brands on the market, but I really liked the ease of the Floppy Disc drive. This was the biggest selling point for me. I just carry 5 or 6 discs with me wherever I go. I take the pictures at a mid resolution setting, 1280x960, then pop the disc from the camera and into any PC and they're ready to e-mail or whatever it is you'd like to do with them. No special software needed to upload pictures to your computer. So very easy to do!!! The number of pictures you can store on each disc all depends on the resolution setting you use. I've found that the highest setting on this camera takes up alot of disc space and only allows 3 pictures per disc. I only use this setting for "special occasions" such as birthdays and holidays, but the next setting down does just fine for every day pictures. This will allow me to get about 6 images per disc. 

Another feature that I like about this camera is the LCD screen. This enables me to see the pictures as I take them. I'm the type of person that just has to see my pictures as soon as possible so I've spent way too much money on the 1-hour photo developing. Not any more! I just shoot the picture, see it on the screen and know immediately if this is a shot that I like. If not, I just delete and go for another one. Its as simple as that. 

I also like the different "types" of pictures I can take with this camera. With just a touch of a button, I can take black and white photos as well as Sepia tone photos. No more special black and white film needed. This is a great way to capture "old fashioned" looking photos. 

You'll also find a MPEG movie feature on this camera. Great for recording short 5-15 second videos that can be e-mailed to family and friends. I've used this feature to e-mail videos of my little girls first steps and more. Again, you'll only be able to hold 1 video per disc, but its still a nice feature to have.

I do recommend buying an extra battery for your camera though. The one that comes with it will only take about an hour and a half worth of pictures and you need to wait till the battery loses all its power before recharging, to save the battery memory. I purchased a 4 hour, non memory affected, battery that allows me to recharge at any time and not affect the memory. This gives me the extra battery on hand at any given moment. 

After I've taken a few discs full of photos, I transfer everything over to a Zip disc and clear my floppy discs to use over again. You can't do this with a roll of film. I find that I take pictures now just to take pictures. I don't print out every one that I take, only the select few. My husband is convinced that this camera will "pay for itself" within 6 months at the rate I'm taking pictures. The camera is a bit bigger in size than your average "point and shoot", but I don't feel that its any bigger than my Canon Rebel SLR camera. 

If you've not noticed already, I must say, I LOVE THIS CAMERA!!
