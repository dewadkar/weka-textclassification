            I have owned two Lincoln's, and just finished a one week trip to Vermont with my family in a 2000 Town Car, rented from Hertz. This Lincoln is plenty big for four large adults, and all their luggage. Even loaded, it still rides well and gets decent mileage- over 20mpg, on the road.
 
The ride is quiet enough for three passenger to sleep, while one person drives. The 2000 Town Car has a much firmer suspension, and is less prone to rolling and drifting as the older models. 
But it is still a big car, and needs some space for parking, and for turning. 
Some features I like: the inside/outside thermometer, to tell you when the weather is cold enough that the rain may be turning to ice; the traction control, to keep you from slipping; the standard air suspension, to keep the car level, despite a full load; the standard multi-adjustable leather seats, very comfortable on a long trip; the keyless, pushbutton entry system, so that you can lock the keys inside- and still get in.
Features I don't like: the rounded body makes it hard to tell where the end of the car is- making it harder to park; rear seat legroom- surprisingly- could be a little better. I think they are now making a stretched version to deal with this problem.
Finally, the reason I say to buy used is that Lincoln's, while well-built and solid, have a terrible resale value. They depreciate dramatically in the first two years- far more than European or Japanese luxury models. You can almost always find lots of two year old Lincoln's, with low mileage, available for less than half of the original price. Since the styling changes little from year to year, why not wait and save almost $20,000 by buying a used one?
I have bought my Lincoln's new, but then I generally drive them till they have over 120,000 miles or so. But next time, I will definitely buy used, and let someone else pay for all the depreciation.<br><br>
