            The previous minivan that I owned before the Odyssey was a 1987 Dodge Caravan (a complete P.O.S.). Yes, I know...it's a miracle that I kept that thing running for 12 years!! Well, I finally thought that i should spoil myself, so I recently purchased the 2000 Odyssey EX w/ the optional Navigational System and I love the car. 

Since other definitive reviews (Vara's and cjk1026's) have covered the main issues on the car, i can only support their descriptions with my confirmations.  

The Exterior: Nice design and impressive, although i would have done something different about the back. In my opinion, the back of the car doesn't look that nice. From the front, however, it looks great. I learned that I gotta be careful when parking though, it's bigger than my old caravan. It's a fairly big car inside and out. Talkin bout the inside...

The Interior: Very roomy and comfortable. The DOORS are very convenient since they only take a pull of the handle to get them to open/close.  As for how safe it is, i'm not sure. I haven't decided to place one of my limbs between it while it's in the process of closing (Sorry to disappoint you).  If there are worries about safety, however, the option can be turned off with a switch located near the driver's seat. I would say that the SOUND SYSTEM is also good. Since my Odyssey came along w/ a cd player, it has made my life much easier. Previously i'd carry around a cd player w/ a carkit. The speakers sound very nice no matter where you are in the car, front or back. The AM/FM radio is like most radios, it has a tuneseek option and stations can be programmed into convenient #'s.  The sound system features which I cherish the most are the controls located on the steering wheel. It saves time and prevents me from taking my eyes off the road. POWER OUTLETS are located in the front and back of the car, which will make it convenient for passengers who'd like to plug in a cell phone or portable cd player. The NAVIGATIONAL SYSTEM can only be described as...cool. It will make any grown adult into a child again as he/she enters in their destination. The system is equipped with a voice which constantly updates you with directions and warnings. The system is fairly intelligent as well. While typing in your destination on the screen which detects your touches, it eliminates letters that can not be a possible destination (this helps if you're not completely sure on the spelling). The system will also recalculate a direct route to your destination if a turn has been missed. This is a great feature for those of you who get lost often (I swear I don't!!...). The inside of the Odyssey also offers a lot of ROOM. Each seat is given a good amount of leg room. The reclining option on the middle seats however leaves something to be desired. It goes back as much an airplane seat does if you purchased the coach option. O well...better than nothing.  Not only is there room for passengers, but there is also a lot of room for cargo.  The middle seats can be removed and the back seat can disappear in seconds.  The BACK SEAT can either bend forward, fold into the well(providing plenty of floor space), or bend back to become a bench (that you can look out of the trunk with). The japanese engineers in Honda were really creative and musta been on some kinda drugs when they thought up all this nifty stuff. 

The DRIVING EXPERIENCE: The engine in the Odyssey is the most powerful in it's class I've been told. Well...I don't know any specifics, but I know that it's pretty powerful. One time I tested it out myself (against the wishes of the passenger sitting next to me) and i found that this huge car could accelerate pretty fast. Being a guy that likes power tools and all, i'm not ashamed to be driving THIS minivan. I'm pretty comfortable in my seat while I drive and I can weave in and outta lanes on the freeway like a madman(Sorry to all those people I've cut off). I've also learned that the handling is excellent...especially when speeding up to a yellow light in order to take a hasty left turn before the light turns red (I know I'm not the only one!). O yea, before i forget, the engine is dead quiet. I've accidentally tried starting up the engine when it was already on because i can barely hear the engine. This is probably the quietest car i've ever been in.

The SAFETY: Ok...if any of you have read my previous car reviews, you'll know this is a major issue for me. If you've read my descriptions so far, you can assess that i'm what you might call an &quot;Insurance Company's Nightmare&quot; or just a &quot;Reckless Driver.&quot; I can truthfully say that I've driven off a road and totalled a car(May my Camry rest in peace). When you drive like me, safety is an important issue. I'm glad to say that I've purchased another car that has made a name for itself in the field of safety. Each seat of this car is equipped with a 3pt Seatbelt w/ a headrest and has passed many collision tests w/ flying colors. That means, I'm probably gonna survive when I total this car too! Just Kidding.

OVERALL: Great car, built like a tank that goes fast, comfortable, convenient for people who get lost (If they purchased the Nav System), and probably reliable (I've only owned it for a month, so i can't say for sure yet)


Note: I payed more than the MSRP because I'm impatient. If any of you possess this virtue you can end up paying less than me, but i couldn't wait to purchase this great car.<br><br>
