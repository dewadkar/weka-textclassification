            We purchased this vehicle from a dealer when it was a year (Jun95) and 11K miles old. Although it is a plain jane unit...ie ashtray, basic cassette/radio, and a five speed manual shift....it has served us well and is still humming along with 107K(Dec 99).

We bought the vehicle for its size, our price considerations and the Izuzu name. Quite pleased in all respects...Maintenance has consisted of the standard oil changes and occassional flush: a recall to repair head gaskets and not much more. Brakes (pads/discs and rear rotors) at 104k. Plugs were just replaced &amp; also just replaced the belts and the alternator at 106 K.. the alt died and replaced all belts as a pm measure.... 

Has been a great family vehicle.. four kids and two adults..and has had most of its miles on the highway. My wife has used the Rodeo for her daily commute of 45 miles each way to work.This is open road especially come these Michigan winters and she has been in four wheel often in her travel. Excellent performance and ease of use. Gas mileage has been an average of 17.5  pretty consistantly.
