            I went out and bought the 3.2TL after several test drives. I even did a few test drives of comparable cars (Lexus ES 300, Toyota Avalon, etc.). The reason I went with the Acura is simple. You get more for your money with this car. Starting at the front, the HID headlights are standard equipment (if you can even get them, they are lots of extra dollars on the competitors cars). The soft leather interior is like nothing I have ever driven in before! Very roomy, comfortable, and supportive. Could use memory seats but what can you expect for $28,000? The interior controls are very easy to figure out, very similar to the 1993 Accord I had before this. The cup holders could be in a more handy place (they are in the center console), but then where would the cd holder go? The stereo is marginal...I expected something more from Acura and Bose. I think I'll be adding new speakers for better sound. The plus of the stereo is the steering wheel controls for volume, and track/station changing. The Sequential Sport Shift option on the 5 spd. automatic is very fun! The cars exterior styling is a little bland, but what better way to hide your 225 horses? This car is a sleeper that gets up and goes! I also love the sunglasses holder above the automatic dimming rear-view mirror! The addition of side impact airbags for the 2000 model is a definite plus. I feel very safe driving in this car. Being that it is a Honda through and through makes me think that it is going to be a dependable car for many years (like my Accord). I feel like I really got a good deal of car for the money. I would have to say, this is the best buy in the luxury/sport sedan category!

Driving the 3.2 TL is like driving a dream. Very tight turning radius, great handling! Acceleration is quick, smooth and quiet. The quietness of the cabin while driving is incredible!

This car would be great for anyone who wants a great luxury/sport sedan but doesn't have a lot of dough to drop. The pro's heavily outweigh the cons!

This car would not be a good buy for someone who is short on money. The 3.2 TL likes unleaded supreme gas. Also it's probably not for people that can't handle a fairly bold driving experience.<br><br>
