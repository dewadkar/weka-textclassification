            The jeep cherokee is an excellent vehicle to own. I have two of them and love to drive them both. One of these is an 85 which has needed no major work done to it at all. They handle excellently on the road as well as off.The reason I bought this particular SUV is because it had a reasonable price. The price is reasonably lower than some of it competition. There is a decent amount of cargo space in this vehicle as well. Although, the seating space can be a little cramped in the back, the front offers a lot of room for those people who are tall and need their space. I am 6'2&quot; and have plenty of leg room in mine. I also know people who are taller than me who own the same vehicle. Besides the usual tune-ups and maintenence, it has not needed any work at all. The jeep is a very reliable vehicle to own. This vehicle is for people who want a nice looking means of transportation during the week, but want to release that more wild off road personality on the weekends.I drive mine on back country roads every weekend and love the way it handles in the mud and off road environment. Those who want a more luxurious SUV should look elsewhere cause this one is not for you. <br><br>
