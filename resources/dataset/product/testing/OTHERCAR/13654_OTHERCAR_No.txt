            I bought this vehicle b/c I had been driving an 86 Chevy Celebrity for 8 years and decided it was time for something new.  I fell in love with my Kia Sportage the second I saw it.  Well, looks can be deceiving.  Don't get me wrong.  The car is cute and fun and drives fairly well.  However, if it is power you are looking for, you are not going to find it in the Sportage.  Yes, it has all of the amenities and a fairly low sticker price but once you own one, or spend any time in one, you will see why.  The body feels like it is made out of aluminum foil and behaves as such in heavy, or even not so heavy winds.  I was in a fender bender the night I drove the car off of the lot and I was told that b/c of the thin metal that was used, my car would never be the same.  Also, I had to replace the battery after only having the car for one year.  Had this been another car, that would have been an easy task.  Not so for the Kia. Because this vehicle is fairly new in this part of the country, parts were extremely hard to find.  It took me an entire weekend to replace the battery.  I wish I had a better experience b/c I truly loved this car.  But things aren't always what they seem.  I felt like I was driving an unsafe vehicle b/c of how easily the car dented.  There were three mysterious large dents on the top of my car that I know didn't come from anything that I could have done to the car.  In fact, b/c I am short, I didn't even notice them until I looked out of a second story window onto my car.  So, those are the facts as I know them.  As I said, really cute car and fun to drive but potential buyers beware!!<br><br>
