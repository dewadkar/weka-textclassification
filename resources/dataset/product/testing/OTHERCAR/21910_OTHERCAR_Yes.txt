            I just traded in a 1999 Mercedes SLK, which I'd grown tired of, for a 528 automatic.  The switch from a fun but tiny 5 speed roadster (I'd always wanted one, so I got it out of my system) to a fabulous sedan has been wonderful.  I've had other luxury sedans (Infinity, Lincoln, Audi), but the 528's definitely the best.

The radio's a bit weak, even with the upgrade to premium, the cup holders are still not up to our U.S. standards and expectations, and maybe the engine could use slightly more power (not a real complaint, just a comment).  Other than that, this car is EVERYTHING a luxury sedan can be.  The ride's smooth and tight, steering is very tight and sporty, the seats are quite comfortable and the amenities are excellent.

I highly recommend the 528 to all prospective buyers.  It may seem expensive, but it's worth it and not out of line with other comparable lines. Happy driving!!
