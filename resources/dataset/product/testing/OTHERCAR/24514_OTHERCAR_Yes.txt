            I've been looking for a small, versatile digital camera with good picture quality for some time. After having some bad experiences with digital cameras, I was sceptical. 

I was in Best Buy looking around and saw the Nikon Coolpix 885. It had everything I wanted. It's <b>compact size</b> was perfect to fit into my hand (I happen to have small hands) or into my purse, which made it easy to travel with. The <b>high resolution</b> (3 megapixels) promised great photographs. The menu looked <b>user-friendly</b>. 

The problem? Best Buy only had one of these cameras left and it was the show model with minor defects in it.

I decided to buy it anyway. The price was unbeatable and the minor flaws of the camera were of no importance to me. I could definitely live with a scratch on the battery compartment and a missing lens cap cord, considering that the store was nice enough to provide me with a replacement cord at no charge (minor detail, but made me feel better, nonetheless).

The camera includes a SmartMedia card to hold your pictures, a USB cable to connect to your PC, so you can download the pictures, and software for your PC. Unfortunately, you have to purchase the re-chargeable battery and battery charger separately. And they are not cheap!

I fell in love as soon as I started using this camera!

The pictures delivered by the 3.21 megapixel imager are high-definition and high-quality. The 3x zoom is also an improvement over the standard 2x zoom on previous models. The Auto mode and the available 12 additional modes of this camera allow the user to customize the way the photos will appear in every light condition. 

However, the problem that I have encountered is with the indoor shots. The background will appear to have a "orangish-reddish" hue to it. But this problem can be easily solved by using a different setting on the camera. The Auto mode also works fine. This seems to only occur when using the "Portrait" setting. I guess it depends on the kind of lighting used in the house.

I have also purchased a Wideangle and a Telephoto lens converters for this camera. These require you to purchase a lens adapter before they can be used with the Coolpix 885. The adapter only costs about $10, and does not have to be directly form the manufacturer, a generic one works just as well. All the adapter is used for is to protect the zoom lens of the camera, because it slides out when the camera is turned on.

There is also a Lens Hood that can be purchased, which makes the LCD screen easier to view when using it in daylight.
