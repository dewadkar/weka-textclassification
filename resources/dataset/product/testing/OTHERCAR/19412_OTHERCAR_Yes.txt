            I have an affinity for Honda's, in fact my whole family does too.  We all love our Honda's.  I have always driven a Civic or Accord but very recently have bought a CRV.  Quite simply put, it's the best car I've ever owned for several reasons.

The best feature is that I feel very safe in my CRV.  One sits high and is on a more even level with most other cars.  My previous Honda's sat very low to the ground and I felt intimidated driving, especially around larger cars and trucks.

The CRV is a utilitarian Sport Utility Vehicle.  It is very simple, not showy or splashy.  Mine has 2 wheel drive and seats 5 very comfortably.  The seats are a little stiff however in the back.  

The CRV handles very much like a civic and I often feel that I am still in my Civic as far as performance and handling goes.  I don't feel that I am driving a larger Sport Utility at all.  I don't have to make any special considerations while turning or off road driving.  

I also am able to &quot;haul&quot; much with this car, including Christmas trees, furniture, and art exhibits all with no problems.  While not a rugged person by nature, I do very much enjoy the ability to drive off road.  

The gas mileage is good and I average about 30 + on the highway.  It takes me $12 to fill her up with unleaded.  The CRV is outstanding with regards to performance, durability, safety and general all around fun car.  I would recommend this car highly.<br><br>
