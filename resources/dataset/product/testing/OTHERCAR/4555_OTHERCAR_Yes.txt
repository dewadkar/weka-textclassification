            I have a 97 Buick LeSabre.  If you want a comfort ride, smooth and gliding, buy a Buick LeSabre.  The color I chose was between a blue/metalic purple. My four year old grandson loves purple and when he sees my car he says "Wow Nan, beautiful!" My interior is leather, which in buying my next LeSabre will be velour.  Leather is hot in the summer.  One thing nice about leather seats is that when you seat children in your car and they spill something, it can be wiped up easily, as opposed to velour, but velour is much more attractive.

If you want a car that is good in snow buy a LeSabre.  It holds to the road.  I never fear driving in snow now since I bought this particular model.

I like a big car because when you are out there on the killer highways, you want to feel save.  The Buick LeSabre also has a lot of power.  I have a v-6 engine and it has a lot of power when needed.

The trunk of my Buick is so large.  We went to Myrtle Beach on summer and that trunk held so many things, 4 suitcases, golf bag, cooler, and groceries, really!!!

I have had this car for three years, and never had anything wrong with it.  Like the energizer bunny, just keeps going, going, going.

I have always felt when you drive a big classy car you feel good inside, that you have chosen a beautiful model such as the Buick LeSabre.  My kids say it is an old ladies car.  Maybe so, but if you ladies get a chance to buy one do it.  You will never regret that smooth ride.

Buy a Buick next time around.


My father was a Buick diehard and I suppose that is where I get my love for that type of car.
