            If you want a gentlemen's sports car with, size comfort and amenities for an adult you should consider a Mark VIII.

The car rides like a monster sedan of old on the highway, but when pushed on a curvy road handles like a sports car. And when you punch the throttle (at ANY speed) it takes off like a shot and the engine roars with a sound that will make the hair on your arms stand up. (All this in a car that if driven reasonably gets better than 25mpg on the highway at 65mph)

The standard sound system is similarly awesome. A few days ago I played the opening track of Victory At Sea while a friend and I were near LaGuardia Airport. My friend winced and offered the opinion that 'that one sounded VERY low.'

The only downside is the size of the passenger compartment. For a car with the apparent size of the Mark VIII there is VERY little passenger space. A six footer would be uncomfortable in the passenger seat and a person over 5'6'' would be squeezed in the rear.<br><br>
