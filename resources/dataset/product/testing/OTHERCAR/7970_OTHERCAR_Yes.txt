Well, as you know most of the teenagers in high school most always want a jeep wrangler. Well, not really but some do. So I have some thoughts about this Jeep. Okay I used to have one of these in high school so I know a little about these. All of this is my opinion. Well, over all they are good SUV's, but there are some downfalls. The bad things about these are that they are so expensive to get a lift on. I had a 4 inch lift on mine. I thought I had enough money till they told me what the price was. Well, lift or no lift they will still flip over and a tight turn. Why do you think I got a car instead of a Jeep SUV. Well, because I flipped but the good thing about it is it had roll bars in it so no matter if you flip you will be generally okay.(unless you hit a couple of cars head on or flew off a mountain, then you'd be dead.) The other bad thing about it is that if you have a 4WD wrangler then you must use it for off road. Because if you use a 4WD on the smooth roads then they will break down quicker than if you use it off road. So 4WD drives are ment for off road and not smooth roads. The last bad thing about it is that if you have a canvas top and you have something that is valuable in there. Then sorry most likely somebody will use a knife cut the plastic windows and or the canvas and they have something that you don't have anymore.

Some good things about these are that they have a great sound system and they handle the best off road unless you have a 2 wheel drive. Then you will get stuck in the mud and have to use your winch to get you out. If you have a winch. The other really good thing about it is that for an 2WD jeep it good pretty good gas mileage. Unless you have a 4 WD then good luck on gas that thing soaks up gas like water in Texas.

Well if you agree with me than please praise this. thanks
