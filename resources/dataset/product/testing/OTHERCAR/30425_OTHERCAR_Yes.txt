            I bought the 1992 Nissan NX 1600 model for 3000 dollars US, and so far it's been well worth it.

Engine: Only 4 cylinders, so the acceleration isnt exactly the best. However, this enables it to get somewhere around 25-30 miles per gallon, which is great. Before this car I drove a '78 GMC Caballero (V8), and I was barely making gas money to get to work. A commuter car like the NX is great if you have a distance to drive on a regular basis.

Another plus are the optional T-Tops, which as you may know are removable solid or tinted glass pieces over your head. These make the car almost like a convertable... almost.

Interior: My NX is completely black on the outside as well as in. The only color on the thing is the temperature readout! Moving on, this car is NOT a good idea for tall or large people. I wear 11 1/2 size shoes and I feel them almost get caught up on things down there when Im driving.
The back seat appears to be intended for small children, adults shouldnt try squeezing in back there, you probably wont get out.

Overall, it's fun to drive (if you can drive a stick), nice and compact, and great on the wallet for gas as well as retail price.<br><br>
