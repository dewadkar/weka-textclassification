            I love this car!  This is my 5th Volkswagen.  I purchased this as a commuter car as the drive to my workplace is over 140 miles round trip.  This car averages 50 MPG or about 700 miles per tank.  It's so nice to see the gas gauge at a half tank &amp; know that I can drive another 350 before I run out of gas!

I have waited a few years for this car.  They have been in high demand &amp; the timing was never right for me.  When I finally had the opportunity to purchase this one, I had never even driven it! I was hoping that the TDI version would be peppy but I told myself if it was not as peppy as a gas engine version it was OK because of the savings.  Luckily, I was very pleasantly surprised by the pick up &amp; pep this car has!  It's so much fun to drive!  It's solid &amp; feels in control at all times.

It has every creature comfort (power everything, moonroof, CD player &amp; Monsoon sound system) &amp; makes my drive enjoyable instead of a chore.  The seats are harder than most which is great when you are a commuter.  You feel comfortable &amp; supported - no more achy back!

This year VW finally added antilock brakes as a standard safety feature.  I have waited years for this!  The daytime running lights, front &amp; side airbags, FULL SIZE SPARE &amp; antilock brakes make me feel very safe even though this is not a large car - it's roomy but it's still considered a small car.  The two year bumper to bumper with all major services included at no charge &amp; roadside assistance also gives peace of mind.

I love this car &amp; my kids love this car! The important thing is that when I do have the kids in this car as opposed to the van, I still feel we are safe.
