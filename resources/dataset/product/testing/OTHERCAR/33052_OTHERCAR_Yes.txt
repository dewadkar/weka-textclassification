            My family and I bought our Dodge Caravan 1 tear ago and have had no problems with it in that time. It runs like a dream and is a must with children. We bought the van because of the children and we wanted a vacation vehicle.

I love the room the van gives us and the fact that at any time you can remove one or both of the bench seats for added cargo space. Pretty good on gas mileage and looks pretty good as well.Everything is easily accessible as far as the engine. We purchased the van which is a 1993 for $3795 and so far it has been well worth it. 

If you have a family of 4 or more and like to travel you should really think of this van as an option. If your into Sports cars and don't have a family it's not going to be for you.
