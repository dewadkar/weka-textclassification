            This is the second Envoy that we have bought.  Our first was the regular length that seats five.  The Envoy XL seats 7 very comfortably.  We bought the SLE 4x4.  We have had no problems with it and highly recommend it.  My father in-law liked it so much that he just bought a Trailblazer EXT (which is the Chevy version).

We have 4 children and they all love this truck.  We looked at many different vehicles before deciding on this one.  We chose this truck because we really liked our other Envoy and it was the perfect size for our family of 6.  We looked at the Chevy Tahoe and Suburban also (GMC Yukon is the same).  The Envoy XL is actually longer than the Tahoe and is only a few inches narrower.  The Envoy XL has 2 feet behind the third row seat as well as a compartment under the floor where the Tahoe has only a few inches behind the third row.  The Suburban has about a foot more behind the third row but gets worse gas mileage.  We looked at vans also but we just don't like vans.  My wife drives this truck and is very comfortable driving it.  It has a very tight turning radius.

Getting into the third row seat is very easy.  And you can get to it from either side.  The second row just folds and flips forward with a lever on the side of the seat.  The second row is split 60/40 so you can do this from either side.  It rides great and the seats are all very comfortable.  Adults have plenty of room in the third row.  The rear doors are very large which makes it easy to get in and out.

The standard inline-6 engine has 275 horsepower and is very smooth with plenty of power.  A V-8 engine is optional that has 290 horsepower and more pulling power.  The four wheel drive works great and is simple to use.  It has the options of 2 wheel drive, full time 4 wheel drive, automatic 4 wheel drive, and 4 low all with a switch on the dash.  The standard 17" wheels are great in snow.

We love this truck and there is actually nothing that has disappointed us with it so far.  We highly recommend it!
