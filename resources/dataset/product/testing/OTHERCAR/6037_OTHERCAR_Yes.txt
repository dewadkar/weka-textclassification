            I'm a 48 year old male,overweight but I like creature comforts. I decided to move from a Suburban into a new 2002 Mid-size sedan.  Looking through the Internet and a couple of magazines, I had narrowed it down to either one of the big two, Toyota or Honda. A Saturn Dealership was located between the two dealerships and as I was driving from one to the other I decided to take a look at Saturn. I have friends who own the car and they always raved about the quality of workmanship and reliability.  Having been in side the Saturn smaller car, I didn't believe that Saturn had a car that would fit me with the comfort that I wanted.  Boy, was I wrong.  After slipping into a L-200, Saturns 4cylinder mid-size car, I became a believer. Surprisingly, the seats were amazingly comfortable. This was one of the biggest test that I have. I weigh well over 300 pounds and finding a seat that will fit a big man is hard.  Neither the Accord or Camry felt as good.  With the power seat option, I was able to adjust the seat for a perfect fit. The bolsters on the sides of the seat hugged me and the support under my thighs was excellent.  After taking it out on the road for an extended test drive, I learned that this car was responsive, agile, and quiet.  Not as quiet as a Lexus but well on a par with Honda and toyota. The salesperson explained the safety features that came standard and the ABS with traction control and the Head Air bags were a definite plus.   I was offered the chance to "borrow" the car for a 24 hour test.   I took the car,drove it home and my wife and I took it for a drive that lasted well over 3 hours and we put over 100 miles on the car.  I drove it on rough roads, on a local mountain road and pretty much pushed it hard to see how it felt.  I was amazed! The Honda and Toyota was not nearly as tight handling as this car was. I also fell in love with the 6 cd changer build into the dash.  The stereo seemed to handle the classical that my wife likes as well as my Jazz CD's.  This might sound trivial, but I spend 2-3 hours every day in my car for work. The car comes standard with the ABS and Head Airbags. It also comes standard equipped with power windows, power locks, remote keyless entry, security system, cruise control, power windows and automatic headlights. I purchased the car with the 6 cd changer option, advanced stereo system and 6 way adjustable power seat.  Total price was under 20k. The same equipped car from the other 2 dealers, even with haggling, was slightly more.  When I contacted my insurance agent to get insurance (20th Century) I was amazed to find that the cost was actually less than my 10 year old suburban.   The people at Saturn of El Cajon were friendly and non pushy. The special 0% financing option was the final deciding factor.  I now have over 5000 miles on the car with no problems.  I'm averaging just over 27 MPG and I love the car.  Before you go and buy a Camry or Accord, do yourself the favor and try a Saturn.  I honestly never believed that I would ever buy a Saturn but I sure am glad that I did.
If you like to customize the car, the dealership I was at offered 19" rims with low profile tires and a lowering kit. I passed on the options but I had the chance to look at one and it made the new 2002 Camry look positively ugly.
