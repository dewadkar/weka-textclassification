            I've had a Coolpix 950 for a little over a year now. That is time for it to have been superseeded by the 990 but also time to have lots of experience shooting with it and to discover its reliability in long term use. 

It is a superb camera for the enthousiastic photographer who wants to switch to digital. The camera feels good in the hand. In manual mode you have at your fingertips everything you can control on a conventional SLR - an optical zoom, manual focus, manual aperture, metering modes, etc. It also has a 'point and shoot' automatic mode for quick snaps. 

A4 prints on photo paper with a photo-quality deskjet from pictures taken with the 950 are very good - quality is pretty much indistinguishable from 35mm wet film technoology even when shooting well below the memory-hungry maximum quality. 

<b>Features:</b> 

* 2.11 milion pixel CDD for improved resolution (1600x1200, 1024x768 or 640x480). 
* 3 x Optical Zoom (38-115mm) glass Nikkor lens. 
* Macro mode to an amazing 2cm. 
* Manual focus (ten steps from 10cm to infinity). 
* Intelligent exposure metering. 
* 1.5 frames per second continuous mode - very handy for moving objects!! 
* Decent size 2&quot; LCD monitor. 
* Best shot selector, so you don't have to waste valuable space.  

The neat swivelling design carried forward into the new 990 makes it very convenient in use, allowing shots from high level over a crowd's heads, self portraits and even candid backwards-facing shots! However, my camera came loose at the swivel joint and needed sending back to Nikon for a repair - thankfully just before the 1 year guarantee was up. Maybe I was just unlucky, but I suspect the design is not intended to cope with photographers shooting thousands of shots a year.

As the onboard flash is very close to the lens, red-eye occurs frequently on flash photos. This can be removed electronically, or the red-eye reduction mode can be used, but the delay built into that risks missing the perfect shot. The only real cure is buying the external flash bracket, which doesn't work too well with my Cobra Nikon-compatible flash gun, and in any case makes the resulting camera/flash combination look a bit unweildy. 

The other downside is the unreliable serial cable and transfer software supplied. My advice would be to replace the serial cable with a CompactFlash reader or PCMCIA card at the earliest opportunity and ensure you clear up after the Nikon View software, which has a nasty habit of leading vast quantitites of temporary files behind. 

<b>Quotes</b>

Also i get really good results when i produced many Apple Quicktime VR projects the camera works great and let me take good and clear shoots, really really a good choice for webdesign, print, and 3d productions.

Quibbles aside, it is an excellent camera and if I was replacing mine tomorrow, I would stick with Nikon. <br><br>
