            Well...let me start by saying that I never did actually buy this car.  My parents did, then gave it to me as a Christmas gift.  Some gift eh? *big grin*

Anyhow, if I had the money (and now I do), I would definitely buy this car again!  Why?  Because, as the title says, you don't have to know a darn thing about how a sports car is supposed to be driven in order to drive this car.  I can count easily 10 times when I should have been in an accident and probably would have been had I been driving anything beside this car.  A Vette? I'd have been toast a long time ago.  A Viper? Please!  Upside down in a tree would have been the least of my worries (per Kelsey Grammer).

Let me start by saying that the ABS on this car is very sound.  It's not the best (that title still belongs to Porshe), but it works best if you actually have a clue how to use it.  Just mash on the pedal and don't let up on it until you stop.  And trust me, you'll stop VERY quickly.  But the braking does take a bit to get used to, especially if you ever plan on driving this car in the winter.  But that technique would take too long to describe so I'll just say, if you have to drive a Stealth in the winter, make sure your tires aren't bald.  Nuff said.

The automatic trans in this car is deserving of only rave reviews.  I once accidently moved the shifter to the L (1st gear) position as I was driving on I-696 in Michigan...I awaited the dreadful sound of gears grinding and the engine over-revving.  It never happened.  I later learned that the trans has a built in safety feature to prevent you from over-revving the engine, and thus allowing idiots (like myself) to drive the car safely.

The actual driving is interesting.  It's a car that can go straight and get there fast if that's what you want, but the more I drive my Stealth, the more it seems at home with the &quot;S&quot;'s.  It lives for the tight corners, the short straights, and digging hard back into another turn.  Of course, this assumes the driver is as brave (or stupid, it all depends) as the car is capable.  And it is VERY capable.  With my Michellin Pilot XGTZs, I've got about 0.97g of lateral acceleration, and my 0-60mph is around 5.6 sec, 1/4 mile is close to 13.9, and (my favorite) the 0-100-0 mph takes a relatively short 15 sec.  It is a tad slow off the line, but the engine does pull strongly all the way to the redline, and that &quot;Power/Economy&quot; button next to the shifter is a nice addition.

My only problems with the car have been a poorly installed passenger side window (my dad and I eventually had to replace the window regulator) and my CD player had finally died (I'll be replacing it shortly).

So, is this the car for you?  Well, if you're looking for gut wrenching acceleration, unbelievable breaking, or civil driving habits, then look elsewhere.  Granted, compaired to nearly every other sports car out there, the Stealth is probably the most civil of the group, but it's not a piece of cake to master by any means.  However, if you're looking for a sports car that had respectable acceleration (for its class), decent mileage, great driver ergonomics, and a car that is just plain fun to drive, then check out a Stealth R/T...but test drive before you buy!

Oh...and if anyone has a Stealth R/T Turbo they're looking to get rid of, drop me a line.
