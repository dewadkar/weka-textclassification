            Have had my 1999 Acura Integra GSR (in Supersonic blue as seen in the picture!) for about a year now and have enjoyed it quite a bit.  This is my second Integra (previously owned a '91') and I traded in my 98 Accord for this little speed-demon.   

What do I love about it?  Let's start with the slick, short-throw gear shift which has that wonderful Acura/Honda feel, the taut suspension that wants to be thrown into corners and the 1.8 liter VTEC engine that loves to be revved past 7000 rpm.   This car will do it all: play hard, carry a lot of stuff and look good in the process.  And oh yeah, the Acura build quality and reliability; if this car doesn't make it to 150K, I would be surprised...   The nifty Supersonic Blue is only available in the GSR so I don't see very many like mine around the corner.   Throw in a sharp black leather interior and you'll have people gazing wistfully as you drive by :)

What don't I like about it?  Some small complaints, the car is a bit under-tired (Michelin XGTV4-P195/55 on 6&quot; alloy wheels) for the suspension and gives up grip pretty quickly in the corners.  I'm looking into getting some lower profile Pirelli 6000's for better handling.  The dashboard is a bit oddly shaped (concave), the engine requires premium or it idles pretty roughly, reverse is a bit balky on my shifter, the cupholders are flimsy and I had a slight defect on my interior trunk cover.   

Would I buy it again?  That's a tougher question.  This Integra body style has been around since 94 and is due for replacement this upcoming model year.  Toyota has their new swoopy Celica at a decent price, the VW Jetta is pretty sharp and fast with the V6 and the Eclipse, while a bit overdone, is tough competition...  The 99 Integra is still a looker and if you like driving Honda/Acura, the choice is obvious.  But wait'll the 2001 model year Integra comes out, Toyota, VW and Mitsubishi may be left behind in the dust again...

10/20/00:  Purchased Bridgestone Potenza RE-730's (205/55) from Tire Rack and the car grips much better in the wet and dry.  Dump the XGTV4's, they're not very good and VERY expensive to replace ($150/tire)...<br><br>
