            My husband decided it was time for me to get van while I was pregnant with our 3rd child.  At first I was a little hesitant because I didn't think that I would be able to drive such a large vehicle.  I was currently driving a firebird for the past 15 years.  He eventually did talk me into it.  It was between a Caravan and a Venture.  I decided to get the Venture, because my brother-in-law had one, and he seemed to be very happy with it.

Well, as far as me getting used to it, it took no effort at all.  I was especially worried about not being able to judge how close you are to other cars because of the short nose.  But it was not hard at all, I got used to it real fast.  I love the fact that it seats 8, that the seats are removable and fold over very easily.  It's such a plus when I go food shopping.  We also have the 2 built in car seats, which is an option.  It has 4 doors, which is great for the kids.  The remote controlled doors are also a great feature, especially if you're holding a baby or you're hands are tied with packages.  

This van has such a nice, smooth ride.  It has a lot of leg room for every passenger, and lots of cup holders.  I highly recommend this mini-van for families with children.<br><br>
