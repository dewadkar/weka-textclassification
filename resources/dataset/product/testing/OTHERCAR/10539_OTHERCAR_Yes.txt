            I leased my 1996 Voyager Van when I was pregnant with my twins.  Already having a small child, I realized the need for MORE space and I knew that would be an understatement when the twins arrived. All I can say is that I love my van!!  I always said that I would never be a &quot;geek mom&quot;  with a van, but now I can't see how I ever got along without it.  I had a cd player added which is a nice bonus (for all those Barney songs) but the stereo system stands on its own also.  It's very roomy and really comfortable to drive.  My husband is 6'7&quot; and has plenty of leg room.  But with three kids and always being on the go, it's very hard to keep the interior clean, because there is so much floor space.  I put in a little bin in the front to store things.  And the trunk could be a bit larger, but we have taken long trips and had enough room for our things. Built in car seats have spoiled us as well as the driver side sliding door.  It's a MUST HAVE with kids.  Overall, I definately recommend this van to anyone wanting extra space and a very comfortable ride!!<br><br>
