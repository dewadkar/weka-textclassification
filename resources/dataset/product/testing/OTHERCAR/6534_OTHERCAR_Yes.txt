            Three years ago we retired our old minivan and bought a new one.  We looked at almost all the minivans and SUVs that were on the market because we wanted to make the wisest possible choice.  

We looked carefully at what our needs were.  We have three children, and always seem to be transporting a couple more.  They all play sports, so we are always loaded up with a collection of volleyballs, baseballs, bats, cleats, etc.  I needed space to hold our enormous grocery bags after weekly shopping, and transport a variety of other family type purchases.  We also wanted something that was roomy as far as leg room was concerned, because a car can be an awfully small place for three spatting children to have to be confined to.

Honestly, I hated the thought of a minivan, but necessity won out.  But if I had to have one, I was going to pick the best, and I believe I did.  We decided to buy the Grand Caravan SE, their top of the line.  

The Grand Caravan SE is sweet.  It's large, with tons of leg room and a real trunk area, big enough to hold everything a big family needs to haul around.  The four captains chairs are leather and as comfortable as can be.  The dual rear doors are very convenient, and the front and rear air conditioning controls make it unbelievably comfortable in our hot summers, and avoid a lot of fighting.  Though that doesn't stop fighting about which radio station we play, though no matter which one, the sound system is very good.

I was apprehensive about buying an American car.  My experience has always been one repair after another, unlike my previous Mazda which was almost maintenance free.  So far the Dodge has given me little to fix after 66,000 miles, and I have to say it has exceeded my expectations and calmed my fears.

The price, at $30,000 was steep, but in comparison, it was very competitive, and was worth the money for its reliability, usefullness and comfort.<br><br>
