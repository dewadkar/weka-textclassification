            The Honda Accord is the most reliable car I have ever owned.  It has never needed an unscheduled trip to the shop in over four years.  Mine is a five speed manual and has great acceleration and power.  The gears are very easy to shift through.

The gas mileage on the accord is unreal.  In my five speed I can get almost 450 miles to a single tank.  I cant even get that out of my SUV that has over twice the gas tank capacity.  The stereo that came with my accord has been replaced by a cd player but the speakers are original installation and everyone asks me what speakers I put in.  They are the original ones and they sound great.

My Accord however does have some handling problems in the rain.  The tires tend to slip a little bit on wet surfaces.  Even when starting out slowly as an experienced five speed driver the engine spins the tires too fast and the tires slip.

The trunk in the Accord is large enough to fit FIVE full size golf bags, and who knows how much luggage.  Just as the new commercial says, the rear seats really are way back there.  There is plenty of room in back to comfortably seat three people.

A conveniant hole passes through to the trunk from the back seat making it an ease to carry skis, or even lumber from the shop.  Unfortunately though, as with most compact cars, the tire is a donut and wont last very long.

I have driven my Accord thousands of miles across the country and it has handled very well and has lasted and will last a very long time.

I recommend this car to anyone and everyone who wants a good reliable efficient car.<br><br>
