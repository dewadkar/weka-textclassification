            I love my 87 Saab 900 Turbo. I bought it in 1995 from it's original owner and it was served me well. It was the car I would have bought if I could when I was a college student in 1987.

It's fast, nicely appointed - power everything, the heated seats are something I never thought I would want but I love them,  the car handles excellently, the zero to 20 isn't too great, but 20 to 60 is. Definitely the most fun and best car I've ever owned. 

The trunk is incredible. With the back seat down, I can haul almost anything. It is a great combo sports car and truck.

It's 2000 now and the car is showing it's age. Lots of things are starting to go wrong and the electric system seems to be unfixable. My battery is dead again (fifth time in two years). I've been spending $1K to $2K a year on maintenace. Parts are very expensive. Service is too since the engine is backwards and awkward to work with. If you have the time and tools and expertise, then this is less of a problem. 

There are a lot things that could soon go bad (power windows, sunroof, transmission). I'm considering parting with it soon. <br><br>
