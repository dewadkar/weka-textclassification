            Let me state that just because I do not recommend this car doesn't mean it is bad at all.  Now (early 2002) there are a handful of good small wagons on the market in this class that are better choices.

When my wife and I purchased this vehicle in 1999 it was the the only small (non-luxury and non-4 wheel drive) station wagon on the market except for the Ford Focus.  Since the Focus was in its 1st model year, we avoided it.  So the vehicle configuration as a wagon is what essentially sold us.  Well, that and the nifty polymer panels.

That leads me to the other Saturn Corporate gimmick, the no-haggle policy on price.  We had just left a 4 wheel drive semi-competitor's lot disgusted with the games they were playing in the attempt to get us to purchase a vehicle we didn't want.  The Saturn policy was a ray of sun shining like a halo on the car!  You will never hear the term "the little lady" at a Saturn dealership!  But this can be a bad thing when you realize you are spending upwards of $16,000 for a small vehicle essentially designed and engineered in the late 1980's.  But to its credit, the SW2 has undergone major enhancements and updates to its already forward-thinking design.

We have the DOHC engine, which I hear is a must for this vehicle.  Ignore the pundits whining about the "buzzy" engine.  It buzzes because of a more durable design feature - the steel timing chain rather than a polymer timing belt.  The timing belt is like riding a bike with a thick rubber band and a timing chain is like riding the same bike with the normal metal chain.  Get the idea?  The engine seems very durable.  Not to mention very peppy and very, very efficient with gas!  Urban mileage is in the low 30s and Highway trips do 37-38 mpg.  The upgraded suspension makes the car handle pretty well for such a small and light vehicle.  I prefer a heavier car on the winding back mountain roads mostly because more weight makes a car feel more securely planted on the pavement.  But you don't get 38 mpg on a heavy car.

The polymer panels came in handy when a taxi spun out ahead of me on an icy highway last year.  I crushed his rear quarter panel and he poked a hole in the bumper.  The 2 dents popped out in about an hour.  Cool!  

The one recurring issue is the leaking door seals.  If the seal gets wet (like when you open the door during a rainstorm), water siphons into the cabin at the wet spots.  Every friend with this car has related similar issues.  The suspension posts intrude quite dramatically into the cargo area.  This leads to a relatively narrow passage with the seats down.  And the only daily annoyance is the relatively wide turning radius.  My Taurus turns tighter than the SW2!  Forget parking in crowded mall parking decks with 2-way traffic.

This was a great car in the 90's but it sorely needs updating now to justify its price.  However, make sure to look at it.  By the time some dealerships get done hosing the unsuspecting customer, the competition's car can easily cost much more with nonsense add-ons.
