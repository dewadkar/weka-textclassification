            I was in the market for a Digital Camera in March (2000), and I looked at alot of different cameras.  I had about $1k to blow, so I was looking only at 3 megapixel and above.  I saw the Sony cameras, but those are far too big.  So, I bought the Powershot S20.

This camera is great for a bunch of different reasons:
1) <b>I love the size of this camera.</b>  I do not need to lug around a big camera case - it simply fits in my pocket.  It's about 4in. X 3in. X 2in., and is the perfect weight (not too heavy to hold for a while, but not too light that it feels cheap).
2) <b>It is very easy to use.</b>  The zoom, menus, and navigation within menus are all very intuitive.  I found that the dial on top (to select the mode that you are in) is not so obvious, but once you get used to this, it's very convienient.
3) <b>3.3 Mega Pixels!</b>  The fact that it has the potential for such high quality is great, and it's relatively easy to change to a lower quality.
4) <b>2x Optical, 4x Digital Zooms.</b>  These zooms work very well, and the digital one is pretty effective, even in darker conditions.
5) <b>Picture Stitch.</b>  This feature enables you to take a bunch of pictures in a row (horizontal or vertical, up to 20 or so pics) or box shape (only 4 pics), and the included software will stitch the pictures together to create an aggregate picture.  This is a fun thing to use for wide or tall objects, and the box method is good for snapping documents up close.
6) <b>Connectivity.</b>  Connectivity is very good, with the CF card (up to 340MB IBM microdrive compatibility) as well as a direct USB cable (from camera to computer).

A couple of things I would like to change:
1) <b>Auto Mode.</b>  They have an auto mode, which means that you cannot adjust the compression rate or the size of the pictures, and you cannot choose whether or not the flash activates, or if it is in one of its special modes (e.g. red-eye reduction).  But, in Manual Mode, you can choose all of these functions.  So, I don't really see the point of Auto mode (it's not like you are forced to focus the camera in Manual mode), and I always use Manual Mode.
2) <b>Features.</b>  I would have liked to see more features.  Not that this guy doesn't have good features, but it would have been nice to see a movie recording function, or a sound recording function, or maybe some more advanced picture effects.

Overall I really like this camera, and I am never without it and the trusty 64MB CF card.<br><br>
