            For a while, I drove a 1991 Corvette Convertible...it was an engine with two seats, and two uncomfortable seats at that.  But when I purchased the 2001 Corvette Convertible, I experienced something entirely different... A Luxury car with a Corvette Engine, what more could I ask for?

P.S. Bear in Mind, I can only speak for the options that I have, which is pretty much all of them.  I went fully loaded.

HEAD UP DISPLAY - a green LED display on the windshield that allows you to monitor your speed, RPM's and fuel levels without taking your eyes off the road, a true safety feature above almost any other that I've seen.

SOUND SYSTEM - a twelve disc CD changer, plus one in the front provide for convenient and logistic listening, with sophisticated sound controls, and several auto-tones, that can assimilate to any kind of music you want, the BOSE speakers, with an amp under the passenger seat and a subwoofer under the driver's seat allow for incredible sound both inside and outside the car.

RIMS - Pentagonal Chrome Rims are discrete enough to not take away too much attention from the beauty of the car's natural lines, but are enough to provide a great look in order to compliment the cars' subtle lines on the hood and door panels.

ENGINE - A V8 5.7 liter engine fly in this fiberglass car.  345 horsepower send you careening through the street in an exciting blend of power and control.  Driving the car in 3rd gear while on non-highway streets allow you to fly when you want to, and cruise beautifully slowly to capture attention.

SEATS - The racing bucket seats are very comfortable and 100 percent adjustable to fit any person.  They are incredibly comfortable with dual airbags and pure leather seats.

TRUNK - A New feature in a corvette, this trunk is large enough to fit most items and make this car more convenient than ever.

ON BOARD COMPUTER - Tells you everything from your oil temperature to your tire pressure.  Three odometers, several different gages complete this luxurious and yet technologically sound piece of machinery.

CONS - The car is a little bit too close to the ground causing for ear-piercing scraping that can be painful when driving such an expensive car, the front spouler often     gets disconnected if you live in a house with a driveway, but thirty five dollars and thirty five minutes will fix that.  
The car also lacks a front license plate, which can cause legal problems, especially in California, where I live.

THE BOTTOM LINE: This is no longer an engine with two seats, It is a luxury car witb a whole lot of power.  Although this car is rather expensive, its beat out the Boxter S, and AMG SLK, and an M ROADSTER, in a recent CAR AND DRIVER test for best convertible of 2001... This is totallly justifiable, and it's price pales in comparison to the others...

In the words of Ferris Bueller...It's quite Choice, if you have the means, I highly suggest you pick one up..

My current car, and in my opinion, the perfect car...

happy driving
