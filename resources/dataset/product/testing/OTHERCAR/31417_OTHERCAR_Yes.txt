            Yesterday we gave my graduating sister her new car.  It was a 2000 Oldsmobile Alero GLS with all of the extras.  She absolutely loves it.  It has the premium Dynamic Bass step-up audio system and the spoiler.  Her older car has 230,000 miles on it.  It is a Plymouth Acclaim if anyone would like to know.  Anyways, I didn't realize how nice it was until we drove around town in it.  It has a very quiet ride, excellent handling, and has a powerful engine that should help her when the extra power is needed.  I continue to be amazed at all of the features this car offers.  It seems as if the Owner's Manual never ends.  It is absolutely wonderful to see so many safety features that I know will protect my big sister as she is off to college.  The only thing that we haven't seem to have used yet is the new traction system.  Has anyone out there used this feature yet?  Please respond to my opinion to tell me about it.    I would recommend this car to anyone.  I have a feeling that Oldsmobile did not make a mistake by putting this car into production.  If you are looking for an almost silent ride and a very appealing body structure, this car is worth looking at.  Did I mention that the V-6 works almost effortlessly?  Well it does and it sounds great when put to the limits.  I hope that my opinion will help those looking for this particular car.  <br><br>
