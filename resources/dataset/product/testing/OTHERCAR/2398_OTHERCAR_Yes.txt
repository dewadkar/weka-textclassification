            I have owned my PDR-M5 for almost a year.  I am far from a great photographer.  In fact, this is the first camera I ever owned, film or digital.  Digital cameras by their very nature are quite versatile and take advantage of a wide array of media to show their data.  This is what I was looking for.  While at this point in time, a good film camera will best a good digital camera, I am not so concerned with absolute quality.  However, ease of use and a DECENT picture is important.  When shopping for these gems I originally was looking at the SONY cameras.  They seemed very cool and the floppy thing was extremely convenient.  Then I heard about how many high quality pics you could put on a floppy and that the pics weren't even that great.  So, my almost 1k was not going towards a Sony.  Plus I am not a big fan of SONY anyway, but that is another story.  Anyway, I came across the Toshiba and knew that I had to have it.  It is super easy to use and the instruction manual isn't too hard to understand.  It allows you to adjust settings of the camera if you are so inclined, or you can just let the camera worry about it.  Plus there is a neat movie mode, which requires that there be enough lite in the area becuase there is no dark light capability with this feature.  I also thought that the camera was quite handsome.  It looks like a film camera.  What about the pics?  Well in day light they are fabulous.  I mean they almost look fake.  I have this one picture of a lake with mountains in the back and it is fantastic.  The colors are so vivid.  However, dark situations are hard for this camera to handle.  In auto focus mode, the camera either takes a long time to adjust or won't allow you to take a photo.  It would be at this time that knowing the camera setting enough to manually manipulate them is handy.  ANother peave is the lens.  It is far from a wide angle job.  I need to stand far away from large objects in order to get them in the picture, which causes a loss of detail.. However, I heard that there is wide angle lense available for this camera.  The memory is in the form of a Smart Card which is pretty cool.  However, if you like to take lots of hihh resolution pics, you should spend the big money and get the biggest card you can find.  The 16mb card only fits like 4-7 high res pics on it.  That is not the camera fault though.  I have had no problems or incidents either.  A completely reliable and user-friendly piece of electronics.  I would recommend it to the recreational photographer w/out a doubt.  Oh yeah, the software included isn't all that great. Plus the camera isn't compatable with Adobe photoshop.  Overall, a very good camera.<br><br>
