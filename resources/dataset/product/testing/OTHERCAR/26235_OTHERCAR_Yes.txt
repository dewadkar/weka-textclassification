            First off, the BMW car maker's decided that the title &quot;Sport Utility Vehicle&quot; was too broad, and not specific enough for what they had in mind. So the BMW X5 was titled as BMW's first &quot;Sport Activity Vehicle.&quot; I for one, agree with them. This car is a prime example of activity. It has it all: smooth ride, off-road ability, luxurious interior, and an outstandingly good look. And even for its high price, it's truly worth it. It offers a lot of great SUV features, including tall seating positions, space way in back for my Border Collie and my two Rotweilers, and the capability to tow three tons of snowboarding/swimming gear. Yet, the X5 surpasses the typical SUV downfalls like a rough ride, chassis flex, dicey on-pavement handling, and outrageously lengthy stopping distances. With all its features, this SAV is an excellent selection. I take it everywhere; to school, to the pass, long road trips to visit WSU, camping trips, and even downtown Seattle. Its not only versatile, but incredibly stylish. I couldn't ask for anything more; except for possibly the M version, expected in the next few years. :)<br><br>
