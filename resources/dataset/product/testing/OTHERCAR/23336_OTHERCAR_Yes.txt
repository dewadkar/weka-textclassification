              I bought my 2000 prowler a month ago and am very pleased with it! It is very fast, especially for a V-6. I also own a 99' corvette so I know about speed!  It gets attention wherever you go, and is fun to drive.  The only problem with the car is lack of space and is slightly difficult to get in and out of. Once you do get in the driver's seat and strapped in it is one of the most exciting things to experience.  It sounds mean and with the autostick option you can treat it like a manual transmission car.  With plush leather seats, a disk changer, and a tack right on the steering wheel it is everything you need to cruise the streets with!  If you buy one, you will be pleased with it! <br><br>
