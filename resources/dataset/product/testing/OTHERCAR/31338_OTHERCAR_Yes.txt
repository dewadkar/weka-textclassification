            I've only been married for five months and he's already taking over!  Going through a career change, I lost my company car and had to actually (gasp!) buy one for myself.  After a lot of looking and staying within a budget, we decided on the Audi A4.  Our friend is a car salesman and found us a nice one in black with only 56K on it.

STYLE- If you like a sexy car to enhance (or just give you some) sex appeal, the A4 will do it.  It has a definite Euro-sleek look while keeping the compact size and frisky look.  I'm not sure what the Car Talk guys would say regarding who should be driving an A4, but I think the name, Susie, goes very will with it!  Overall, a small spunky, sexy little car!

INTERIOR- I have the cloth seats which hug the rider and enhance the 'sport' feel.  The lumbar support is good, especially if you have a bad back or take long drives often.  I personally like 'hot cross buns' as I call them, so the seat heaters are like heaven!  My husband's Lexus has seat heaters that are on/off only - you can't turn them up or down (Audi wins here!).  You do have to be careful, though, or your 'hot cross buns' will turn into 'singed burned buns'.  The dash layout is just 'okay.'  The clock is (yuck!) analog and situated within the bottom of the speedometer.  The gas gauge is on the top left center.  I keep looking to the bottom right, but if I ever get the car away from my husband, I'll learn.  You can tell that this is not an American car because there is no 'idiot pointer' to tell you which side the tank is on.  The illumination is red which is a nice twist.  The climate control is red as well, and is somewhat annoying.  The A/C does turn on when you turn the temp up or down, so you have to push it and turn it off.  The heat is hot and the A/C is cold, so there are no complaints on that front.  The console between the seats is sub-par, as it only has a 4x6x3 space into which I can put my junk.  It is also hard to open, as you have to slide a plastic strip (ridged, but flush with the other plastic) towards the driver's seat.  As the passenger (because my husband won't let me drive my car!), I have found it extremely difficult to open which can be good or bad, depending on your life situation.  Moving down, the designer put the emergency brake between the seats (probably because they sold a stick-shift version) where they could have put more room for my "stuff"!  Next to the brake by the passenger side, you have two little pop-ups that someone decided to call "cup holders."  This person is probably blind, unable to drive, and given IV fluids 24x7.  Anyway, picture a cup split into 8 sections.  Now take 2 of those sections and place them opposite of each other, one toward the front of the car, and one towards the back of the car.  THIS is what they call a cup holder.  Now, picture a cup of coffee sitting in these two pieces and pretend you're driving and take a turn to the left or right.  Lastly, picture the 'hot cross buns' thing WITHOUT the seat heater being on.  Capiche?  Moving straight up, the sunroof and moon roof are great, with logical controls.  Oh- about the other window controls- all of them have one touch up and one touch down - a very nice feature!  Okay, okay...the back seat is small.  I am 5'7" and fit just fine, so most people won't have a problem.  The best thing about the back seat is that it folds down to make more trunk room!  The trunk is big enough for two bodies (ha!), so that is a nice surprise for what seems to be a small car!  The spare tire inside the trunk is a mini, but there's enough room to put a full size (15") wheel and tire in the space.  The CD player is mounted in the trunk if your car comes with that option.  I forgot the radio!  The Bose is nice, but there are two many buttons!  I even read the manual and still don't 'get' some of the stuff it does.  This is where a husband is actually good!  He's figured out the radio, etc. and has told me how to do what I want to do.  Kinda like my own 'Radios for Dummies' on site with no fee!

MECHANICALS- My car is the regular A4 with the 2.6 liter V6.  There's nothing 'regular' about this engine, though!  When I talked about the car being 'peppy' and 'spunky,' the engine has a lot to do with those adjectives.  The pick-up is great and even my husband, speed racer, is impressed with the power displayed when he goes to pass someone!  The mechanical integrity has been excellent so far and all of the research I did (lots- I'm a research geek!) consistently and unanimously rate this engine better than its successors.  The upper control arms are supposedly a problem and expensive to repair.  Actually, everything on this car is expensive to repair!  We were missing some plastic lug nut covers, so I called my local Audi dealer to order some replacements.  After I was told that they are $4 EACH ('c&#146mon!  They&#146re PLASTIC!), I decided that I really liked the look of the lug nuts themselves!

SUMMARY-  I know, I know...you were wondering if I'd ever get to the summary...  My opinion so far is that the car is a great value.  If you like German engineering with some extra creature comforts, take a look at this year of the A4.  I would make sure to get the remote unlocking mechanism (I don't have one and now I actually have to use a key...can you imagine?!) because it's very helpful.  We bought a warranty due to the high cost of repairs, so I would recommend you look into one of these online or from the dealer.  If you can negotiate a good price from the dealer, go for it after you've done your own research and KNOW it's a good deal.  

Good luck with whatever car you choose and I hope this review helps you lean toward a car that is a good value!
Whatever you do, though, don't let your significant other drive it, because you'll have a hard time getting it back!
