            I have read all the epinions on this car, and am compelled to write my own.  
THIS CAR IS EXPENSIVE.  That needs to be said.  If something breaks, you will pay.  Dearly.  

HOWEVER.  And that's a big however.  German engineering is a double edged sword.  It's generally high quality with nice fit and finish, and things generally are a cut above your average Toyota Corolla.

The Facts: I bought my 1997 VW Passat with 116,000 on a whim.  It was shiny white, have loads of features and the price was right.  This car is both thoughtful and quirky;  look at where they put the cupholders.  It's very zippy, and my vr6 has no problem pulling out of parking lots.  Generally, I like this car.

The ugly:  My clutch went on this thing and I tell you what I spent almost 2 months without it while the only mechanic in Baltimore who would work on it hacked out why it just wouldn't work.  $2200 later, it was back on the road.  And that was my only major problem. Oh yeah, tires are pricey.  Sure, struts weren't cheap.  But in general, I do like this car a lot.  It runs down the highway like it is on rails, and feels upper crust when I park next to all those Camrys.  And the paint on it is beautiful and high quality.  A lot of people quoted some crazy prices for things like oil changes on this site, but I have NEVER paid nearly as much. I do some work myself on it, but most things need trained people.  

The lowdown:  If you want easy, go and buy the shiniest Honda Accord you can find.  If you want something special that may have a $15 oil filter and lacks a glovebox, for character, buy this car.  I like mine just fine and plan on driving it to 200,000 miles, at least.
