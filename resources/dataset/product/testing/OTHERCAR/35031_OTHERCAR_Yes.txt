            If you want a great digital camera with plently of pixels, and a great zoom this is it.  I purchased this camera after reading the mixed reviews on several internet sites.  I have used a digital camera, a HP 500C for about a year and prior to that camera used a few low end digital cameras.  In the past 40 years have always used Nikons and have 7 Nikon cameras.  Finally the price of film and development got to me.  I really like the shot and view features of the digital camera and the photo print out great on my HP 2000C printer.  Minolta was the winner for my money, even after looking at the coolpix 5000 Nikon.  The zoom from 28 to 200 is simply the only lens most folks will ever need, and you really don't want to have interchangeable lens on a digital camera due to dust on the CCD. The camera contols are just like a SLR and may be too much for the point and shoot crowd.  However, if you want a world class camera, capable of taking great photos you should consider the Dimage 7.  Oh, the batteries.  Not a problem, just go to Wally World (Walmart) for about 10 bucks purchase four NiMH rechargeable AA cells and then purchase a MAHA battery charger (got mine off the net for $21).  The viewfinder is fine, some like it some don't.  I found it to be great, especially in low light.  With the camera now selling for about half price (retail) it's a real bargain.  Plus taking the Compact Flash card, another plus.  So don't worry about the batteries and just purchase a few extra along with a few CF cards.  The 64MB cards are as little at $29.  Sum it up, highly recommended for the quailified photo buff.  Oh, some reviews stated plastic, most is alloy construction that is rock hard and light weight.  Yes, the battery box is plastic and so is the CF card.  But these two access points are not a concern to me.
