            This truck is very reliable, has good power, is comfortable and looks good. I chose the Horizon Blue Metallic color. The ground clearance is good, especially with the TRD suspension package, which I highly recommend. The 190hp V6 will make a statement when you mash the pedal.
Take basic care of it and it will go forever.

As with all good things there are some negatives. It has bad oil filter placement. Toyota should be ashamed of themselves for that...
Shallow truck bed and flimsy body panels. You can dent it just by leaning on it. The prerunners are only offered with an automatic tranny and it doesn't always shift correctly when you stomp on the gas.
That can make you second guess yourself when it redlines before it shifts.
Toyota offered really ugly color choices this year.

This one stickered for a little over $25,000.00 and I paid just under $21,000.00 for it, lock stock and barrel. Do your homework before you go in to buy it and you'll come away a winner. I would whole heartedly recommend the Toyota Tacoma Prerunner XtraCab to anyone who wants a great truck.
