            A mere student was I when I purchased this vehicle. I busted my butt to finally buy a decent car, I worked two jobs and I saved every penny. After all my hard work I finally had enough for a down payment. I wanted a Jetta. God help me, I wanted a Jetta.

I had owned a VW years before. A 1971 Bug. It served me well and sure exhaust filled my car at times and yes the electrical systems in Bugs really ARE that bad. But you know what? That car had character and I loved it and I really liked Volkswagens. 

When deciding on a car I could have pretty much chosen any mid-priced sedan but I liked the way Jettas looked. Of course like an idiot I didn't do any research on Jettas, I figured it's new what could go wrong? Boy am I a moron.

In one of the previous reviews, the reviewer spoke of turning on the AC and suddenly the car slowed down. I had to laugh. I bought a four cylinder and that little Jetta trick is even worse on mine, like a reverse turbo button.

That little morsel I can stand. But it seems like every 6 months something else goes wrong. I've had hoses leak, belts snap and of course the patented VW electrical problems.

My two favorite Jetta moments are as follows.......

So everything seems ok, the car is actually running decently (miracles never cease) I'm at the gas station and after I pump my gas and get ready to go on my merry way I turn the key and.....nothing. Absolutely nothing. The battery's not dead, I just had a mechanic look at the engine so that's not it and it sure as hell wasn't out of gas so what could it be? Jettas have a security system that, if you were a thief would prevent you from starting the engine should you break in....pretty cool right? BUT if something goes wrong with that security system you would end up like me......Some jackass stuck at a gas station.

And finally....Coming home from work in rush hour traffic my Jetta suddenly slows to a stop. I'm stuck in the middle of the bleeping highway for about half an hour when finally a Highway Patrolman stops by and blocks off the entire highway so he can push my car across with his car to the nearby semi truck weigh in station. Priceless.

Probably doesn't sound like much but just buy a Jetta and you will see. 

I just wanted a reliable, fun car....but I wanted a Jetta. God help me I wanted a Jetta.

Update:

Sweet swirling onion rings does this car suck.  

So the beast actually made it 100k miles.  I'm feeling pretty ok with the car...and then the crap not only hits the fan but sends the fan flying into orbit.

Everytime I would accelerate I would hear a high pitched metalic whine, so I take it in to the shop. The guy says I need to replace my tranny.  I figure ok no problem how much could that cost? 

Well my friends the guy searched high and low for a used tranny but does he find one? Oh no. This piece of crap car can never make things easy. Well car guy, I ask, how much is a new one?

FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS! I nearly soiled myself.  This heap is only valued at maybe $8500. There is no way in hell I'm gonna pay that. So now I am waiting to have my tranny rebuilt at the low low cost of $1700.

So if you see me driving down the street (I'll be the guy with empty wallet and the blind furious rage in his eyes) do me a favor and just hit me.
