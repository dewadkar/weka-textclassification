            Let me tell you, I shopped around and shopped around for a digital camera and I was between the HP Photomax 320 and the Samsung Digimax 240. I decided to go with the Samsung because for $20 more, I could get an optical zoom. 

-There is a 3x Opitcal zoom as well a a neat feature that also adds 2x zoom to that. That works by taking the picture with the 3x zoom all of the way out and then go into picture view mode and it allows you to zoom in on the picture in the place that you want.

-The picture viewer mode is very user friendly. It works by zooming out to where it shows many pictures of you can zoom in and look at each of the pictures individually.

-The LCD screen is bright and effective. It works nice!

-The camera also comes with a movie mode which allows you to film a movie for a much memory is left in the camera. I do wish that the camera also took sound with it's movies but it dosen't.

-MEMORY! I have my camera set to take the smaller pictures and at medium quality and they take just fine. I can fit 44 pictures in the camera's 8mb internal memory. If you wish to take the higher quality pictures, at large size, you would only be able to fit a few on the camera. The camera takes SD memory cards. 

-POWER! The camera will last for about 10 min, if it is on for that whole amount of time. If it is intermittlently used, it should last about a half a day depending on your usage. I have some NI-MI batteries and it triples the amount of time that I can take pictures. So, I need to go get some more rechargable batteies!

-FLASH! The camera produces a tremendous flash but takes a while to re-charge. (about 8 sec.)

-There is an option to turn of the LCD screen to save battery life. 

-There is a macro mode for taking objects close up but I find it not to be effective, it still makes the pictures blurry.

-There is an auto timer where you push the button and get in the picture so there are no pictures with a missing family member. The count down lasts 10 sec.


I would recommend this camera to anyone who wants to take decent pictures. If you want to take high quality pictures that can be blown up of zoomed in on, you should probably go get a higher MP camera.
