            I'm a 4x4 SUV lover who wanted top-of-the-line in features and comfort along with the safety  and handling of an SUV.  The TrailBlazer is beautiful and loaded with everything from leather to heated front power seats with memory to colormatched body trim and bumpers...to power sun roof...to 10 CD player,  garage door opener, compass and temp.  full gauge package, etc.   The suspension gives it much more of a controlled sporty ride than previous Blazers and auto 4WD works great, except for some balking in reverse.

The unique design touches of the  TrailBlazer gets lots of appreciative head turns and makes us proud to be driving it.  In fact, we feel that it looks as good as any SUV on the road.  

We like the convenience of the split rear seats and the lift up window on the tailgate and our rear passenger have enjoyed the comfort and ride. 

As with any  SUV, you feel and hear the wind more than in a sedan and the mileage is less than satisfactory.

I feel that this vehicle offers safety, luxury and handling features  that you would expect to pay much more for.
