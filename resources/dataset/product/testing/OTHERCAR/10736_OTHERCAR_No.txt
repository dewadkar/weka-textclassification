            Having been a big fan driving a friend's Ford Escape, I was looking forward to "car-sitting" for a friend and her Masda Tribute for ten days.  While not as sporty as the Ford Escape, it still is a stylish vehicle from the outside and I was considering this test to see if I should purchase one myself.

Definitely not ...

Why?

While the Mazda Tribute has great pickup (was surprised at the acceleration getting on to the highway) and seemed to get decent gas mileage for a vehicle this size, I haven't driven a more unsteady car in a long time.  What specifically was troubling was that, even though I wouldn't move the steering wheel, the Tribute still seemed to jerk around at even the smallest winds or bumps on the roads.  

In addition, the interior was NOISY, especially when the weather is very windy; however, this was overcome with an outstanding sound system (I love what Mazda has done with the CD changer ... very easy to use and outstanding sound.)

All in all, very disappointing -- many better SUV options out there right now.  I'd suggest taking a look around at others before you consider any SUV/truck options from Mazda.
