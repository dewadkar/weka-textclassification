            I bought my 1998 Cavalier new off the lot, because I wanted to have a reliable car, and a safe one for my 2 kids.  The car was very nice looking too.  I really didn't care to much for the fact of not being able to shut off the passenger side air bag, I have a older son who loves to ride in the front seat, but I always hear all these horror stories of accidents with kids in the front seat with the air bags.  Also I did not care for the back seat, it is ok for kids, but forget about putting adults back there, way to small.  I had minimal mechanical problems with the car, the only thing that had to be fixed was  the brakes. Which were under warranty.
But the thing that impressed me most about the car was how safe it was.  One day I was going about 45 mph and a truck in front of me slammed on his brakes, I tried to stop, but couldn't, and went right under his bumper.  I was not wearing a seat belt ( which I always do now), I remember slamming into the steering wheel as the air bags (which I must say were very hot, and something I hope I never have to experience again) deployed in my face and chest.  I thank god to this day that my  son was not with me in the front seat, he would have been badly hurt, the force of the air bags are more powerful than I ever knew.  Well the damage to the car was severe, it was totaled, and I walked away with just abrasions and bruises on my face and chest from the air bags.  Everyone who saw the car was very surprised at how the car 'protected' me.  So  after my experience I would recommend this car to anyone who wants a good quality car  that is very safe.  And of course after the accident I went out and bought a new  one!!!
