            Okay, I've written three negative reviews in a row so it's about time that I write about something that I was happy with!

My sister received a Fuji MX-1200 digital camera for Christmas '99, and while I was involved in the purchase, I was not familiar with Fuji cameras, or any digital cameras for that matter...so the attractive price was the main deciding factor.

I remember reading about digital cameras draining batteries, as well as not being able to store too many pictures.  I witnessed a friend's Hewlett Packard doing just that on a hiking trip.  I decided then that I would wait to buy my own camera until the technology improved.

Then I borrowed my sister's Fuji.  I was absolutely amazed!!  She had a 16 MB memory card in the camera, and I was able to take 163 pictures on NORMAL quality and even upload them all to my computer on one set of batteries!  She made the right choice in buying some Radio Shack rechargable Nickel-Metal Hydride batteries, which I simply recharged in about 4 hours and was able to go out and take 163 more shots.  If I remember correctly, the HP camera that my friend has only took about a quarter of the pictures that the Fuji did.

I found the camera to be VERY easy to use (I did not receive the instruction book when I borrowed the camera, so I had to wing it) and the controls were self-explanatory.  The picture quality was excellent, and the flash was absloutely amazing!!!  

There were several other features that impressed me.  On the back of the camera there is a small LCD screen which can be used either while taking pictures, reviewing what you took, or changing your setup options.  While taking or uploading pictures you always have the option to have the screen on or off, which is nice.  I prefer using it to take pictures, and can't imagine how I put up with conventional viewfinders for so many years.  The camera was also very comfortable to hold, weighs only 10.5 oz. and can easily be mounted on a tripod.

The SETUP feature gives you quite a few options:

1) QUALITY - Basic, Normal or Fine
2) FILE SIZE - 640x480 or 1280x960
3) SHARPNESS - Soft, Normal or Hard
4) FRAME # - Cont. or Renew
5) BEEP - High, Low or Off
6) DATE/TIME - Set
7) RESET

It is very easy to change the settings when you need to, and I have had fun experimenting with the different picture quality combinations.  Plus I love the fact that you can even control the pitch of the beep, or turn it off altogether!

You can turn the built in flash on or off manually, or choose the automatic setting.  There is also an adjustment on the left side of the camera (pretty easy to overlook, actually) where you can switch between close up and distant subjects.

All of the pictures were taken with this particular camera.

The one gripe that I have about the camera is the time that it takes to upload the picture files to the computer.  The transfer time is very slow, and (as far as I know) you have to transfer them one by one.  This can take quite some time.  There is an optional accessory available that allows you to transfer your files via your floppy drive, but I have read about some incombatability issues with certain computers.  It would certainly be worth looking into, because not only would it save batteries, it would also save you quite a bit of time.
 
All in all, an excellent camera for the price!!!  I am definitely saving up to by one of my own, including the same batteries.  Without the high price of film and developing, I might become a photographer yet!
