            The Acura 3.5 RL is an extremely comfortable, smooth and excellent looking ride. Since my dad has to travel a lot for business, he bought one because of the comfort, good gas mileage and the GPS (global positioning system). With the GPS, he has never gotten lost going to appointments in towns that nobody has ever heard of.
When he is not going to appointments, he lets me drive it whenever I please, and I can guarantee you, that this is definitely the best car money can buy.
What is it like to drive this car? Well, if anybody has driven on the freeways of California, you know that they are like driving on a dirt road, but with the RL, if feels like the road was just recently paved.
I recommend this vehicle to the person that drives a lot, wants to ride in comfort and also wants to look good while driving.<br><br>
