            We bought a 2000 Sonota GLS after we had driven our 1989 over 150,000 miles and no major problems. We are still driving the old one. We considered it too good to trade in. The Sonota has a lot of extra things that are standard. It is a very comfortable riding car with plenty of room. The car as far as we are concerned is a better deal at the price than a BMW or other expensive cars. We have all the &quot;frills&quot; without a high cost. Very good gas mileage, 30MPH on the open road. We will probably trade in a few years to their new GX300 series that was not out when we bought ours. We are convinced they are the best cars available. The low interest rate of .9 % was great too.  <br><br>
