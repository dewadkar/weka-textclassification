            I bought one of these cars, because it was affordable.  Parts for it were cheap, it got great gas mileage.  However, avoid the automatic!  after only 5,000 miles the clutch started slipping.  It has a tight steering, and a lot of after market parts available.  I have heard many stories about the head gaskets blowing, however mine with 50,000 miles has not yet.  My opinion, this is one of the best cars for the buck.  Its competition is either less quality or much larger price tag.  I'd recommend a dodge neon to a Teen or maybe someone that wants cheap commuting with good handling and passing power.<br><br>
