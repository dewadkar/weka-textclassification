            The 2001 Nissan Altima I bought new in August 2001 is the GXE Special Edition model. I currently have 50,000 miles on the odometer and for the money spent on it, am quite satisfied with its overall performance.

Engine, Transmission and Suspension

The 4 cylinder engine residing in the Altima is smooth at both idle and hard acceleration and has quite a bit of pep and can propel the car along at a good pace. Gas mileage is quite good for a 2.5 liter 4 cylinder and I have obtained 29 mpg on the highway at a steady 65 mph, and gets 20-22 mpg around town, all on regular grade gas. The transmission, a 4 speed automatic, is nicely mated to the 4 cylinder and always seems to be in the right gear. The suspension is one drawback. The ride is more econocar, like that of its smaller cousin, the Nissan Sentra than that of its bigger cousin, the Maxima and is most likely the result of Nissan bean counters choosing to add a solid beam rear axle instead of an independent suspension. The original factory tires (General AS2000) needed replacing fast as it seemed hydroplaning was its main game. Braking is provided via front wheel disc brakes and rear drums. They have proven adequate so far without much fanfare. 

Inside the Cabin

The Altima GXE Special Edition is equipped with a power adjustable driver seat, which provides infinite adjustment. One negative note is the serious lack of lumbar support for both driver and front passenger, making long trips agonizing on the lower back. Rear seating accommodations are adequate for two people as far as head room and shoulder width, but can be tight on the knees. It can seat three in a pinch for short trips. The trunk is fairly large for a car this size providing ample space for 4 full size suitcases with some room to spare. The car is equipped with most of your basic power features for todays cars (power windows, door locks, mirrors, cruise, etc) Controls are fairly readable and well placed, illuminations are clear. Cabin storage is plentiful including a descent sized center console, four cupholders, and door pockets. Here again Nissan bean counters have interfered as only the passenger seatback has a pocket, not the driver seat.

Major Complaints

After 28 months and 50,000 miles complaints are nil and none. Other than regularly scheduled fluid changes, oil and air filter changes, this Altima has wanted for nothing from a garage.  Based on this performance to date I think this car is a keeper.
