            This was the fourth digital camera that I have purchased in the last 3-4 years and, to put it simply, it is the BEST digital camera I've had. Here are the specifics:

-Smallest camera. The form factor of this camera is simply spectacular. I can carry it in a jacket pocket or even a pants pocket. I had a Sony DSC-P1 which is Sony's ultra-compact but it's odd shape made it seem much bigger. Plus the Sony weighed a ton.

-Image quality. Compared to the 3 mega-pixel DSC-P1, the S300, with only 2 mega-pixels, had the same or possibly even slightly better image quality. I know this is very subjective, but my Ofoto prints and web images are just as good.

-Battery life. I think battery life is very solid. Even when the "low battery" alert came on, I still took another 6-8 pictures. I bought an extra battery anyway which is nice because it only takes 2 hours to fully charge! Also, the charger has a great form factor too.

-Price. This thing is a steal, several hundred less than my Sony DSC-P1. I purchased mine from B&H Video in NYC. Very reliable, great price, no tax outside NY.

Now, the downside:

-Flash power. I have noticed that the flash is under powered. Pictures I took against a white wall at about 6-8 feet weren't full illuminated at the edges. This hasn't been a huge problem, but I anticipate that it will pose a problem shooting from farther away in poorly lighted situations.

-8MB CompactFlash. What's the point? Get the 128MB CompactFlash. I've shot 50-60 pictures at a fairly high quality and not even come close to filling this thing. I'm going to Paris for a week and I don't anticipate filling it.

If you are on the fence, you can't go wrong with this camera. The "cons" are minor.

My price includes a 128MB CompactFlash and an additional battery. I think both are really required.
