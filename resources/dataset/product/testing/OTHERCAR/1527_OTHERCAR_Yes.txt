            I bought my 1996 Saturn SL2 brand new in June 1996.  Here it is four years later, with over 100,000 miles and still going strong.  

I purchased my Saturn for several reasons.  First of all, it is fun to drive and has plenty of power as well as good looks and dent resistant body panels. The second reason I decided on a Saturn vs other passenger cars was that the sales staff was so great.  They didn't follow me around the lot and harass me like other dealership's staff did.  The third reason I bought a Saturn (and the reason I actually decided to test drive in the first place) is the stellar reputation the company has for excellent customer service.  The clincher for me was the great price. 

My SL2 affords me a comfortable ride, awesome braking ability, tight steering, plenty of power and great gas mileage.  I hit a post and there's nothing to show but a little scratch instead of a great big expensive dent.  

If you are looking for a good all around car, this is it.  If you are into luxury cars you might want to try the new LS - I hear it's a good product.  All around, Saturn earns my vote! <br><br>
