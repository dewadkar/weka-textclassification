            I bought my Kia Sportage about 3 weeks ago.  So far, I like this car.  I had a 6-cylinder Nissan Maxima previously.  I'm still getting used to the fact that I can't make last-minute decisions in the 4 cylinder Kia.  I bought this car because I have a 5 year old daughter, and we needed a car with more room.  The Kia provides ample space for our luggage, purchases, etc...I had done a lot of research online on all the SUVs.  The Kia had all the features I was looking for, and was considerably less expensive than all the other SUVs in it's class.  It was also a much better looking car than the RAV 4 or the CRV. Both of those cars had the cheap looking plastic bumpers that always seemed to be falling off.

The one thing I like least about this car is that you can't open the rear hatch without using your key.  It's not very convenient if you're in a hurry.  The doors are also hard to close.  I feel like I'm going to break them when I slam them shut to ensure that they've closed properly.  Other than that, I really enjoy driving around in it.

I would recommend this car to any of my friends.  I think it's a great car for anyone just learning to drive. My boyfriend says it's definitely a &quot;chick car&quot;!<br><br>
