            If you want a reliable, overall outstanding automobile, then buy a Honda Accord. I purchased an Accord Coupe in 1989. My main reason for going with Honda was its reputation for reliability.  I wanted my dollar to go as far as possible.  I'm happy to say it has done that and then some.

I love the fact that I have only had one major maintenance issue with my Accord.  I replaced the brakes at approximately 150,000 miles.  Preventive maintenance issues have been performed on a routine basis (i.e. oil changes, belts replaced, brake pads, pcv valve, etc.)  I find that incredible for a car that has been driven hard for 11 years.  The dependability is far above average.  

However, there is one thing I would do differently when I purchase my next Honda.  I will buy a four-door vs. a coupe.  The doors on my coupe are heavy and long.  I sometimes have trouble getting in and out if someone parks too close.  Now that I have a small child, a four-door would also be easier on my back.  Getting a little one in and out can be taxing.

Finally, my Honda still handles very well.  The steering is precise and the rate of acceleration is outstanding.  The engine is still as quiet as it was when new.

I would recommend the Honda Accord to anyone who wants a quality car.  It is comfortable on long or short trips and the gas mileage is awesome on my five-speed.  I get approximately 35 miles per gallon on interstate trips.  Buy the coupe if you want sporty and don't mind heavy doors.  Buy the sedan if you're looking for something more practical, especially if you have small children or frequently transport other adults.  Climbing in and out of the back seat in the coupe is not pleasant.<br><br>
