            Vehicle was purchased used in Florida, was originally from Maryland. A/C has failed on numerous occasions, have replaced compressor, drier, evaporator and many other parts. Cost over $4000. MB dealer and MB HQ refuse to address problem, the Chrysler school of satisfaction?
Dealer states that A/C parts are prone to failure and poorly placed for serviceability (20 hours labor for evaporator alone). Mercedes HQ backs them up.
Conclusion:
Do not purchase a MB if you plan on keeping it after warranty expires and live in a warm place. MB doesn't care about you and will offer absolutely no assistance.
