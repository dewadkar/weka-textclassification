            <b>Let me take a moment here to explain the following review.  This review is not about how many cylinders or how much horse power this van has.   I am reviewing this van based on its comfort, and how well it fit our family of 5.</b>

We were recently involved in an accident, and while our van is being repaired we are renting another one from <b>Enterprise</b>.  For the first 3 days of this venture, we had a 2001 <b><i>GMC</i> Safari</b> minivan.  I hated it <b>SO</b> much that we returned it in exchange for a 2001 <b><i>Ford</i> Windstar</b>.

<b>Entry into this van</b>

Getting into this van is not easy!!  Its floor is higher than my knee level.  At 5�4� tall, this made this van <b>extremely</b> hard for me to get into.  Add the fact that this van does not have that wonderful  driver�s side sliding door, and this van is virtually useless for families with small children.  There is a step to aid in entry, but it is still hard.    We have a 1 year old, a 2 year old, and a 6 year old, all of whom are sitting in booster seats and need to be buckled in.  This means climbing into and out of this van to buckle the children.  With our 1999 <b><i>Mercury</i> Villager</b>, we are able to buckle in all of the kids while standing firmly on the ground.

<b>Visibility</b>

Here is where the <b>Safari</b> has one good point.  The blind spot on the left side of the vehicle was minimal.  It was completely eliminated by a slight turn of the head.  I found this to be wonderful.  HOWEVER, the visibility from the front and rear windows in this van  was very obstructed.   The windows on the sides of this van are large, and provide a nice view for passengers.    The van we drove, had two rear doors that opened like a full size van doors would.  This left a 3 inch �strip� down the center of the rear window, where the doors joined together.  There were several key spots where cars were not visible through this �strip�.    There is the option to have this van with <b>3</b> rear doors.  This option will eliminate the �strip�.  The driver�s seat sat so high in this van that my eye level was exactly even with the top of the windshield.   At 5�4� tall, <b><i>I</b></i> had to hunch to have a clear unobstructed view out the windshield!!

<b>Rear Seating</b>

Another plus for the <b>Safari</b> is its ability to carry up to <b>8</b> passengers.  The average minivan will only carry 7.  This is a wonderful, and necessary feature for the larger family who still desires a minivan versus a full size van.  However, since this van is hard to get into anyway, I would opt for a full size!  The seating in the rear was nice for our 3 kids.  Our 6 year old sat in the far back seat, and had it all to herself.  Our 1 year old and 2 year old sat at opposite ends of the middles seat.  Their car seats were far apart, so they were unable to pick on each other!!  My kids <b>LOVED</b> this!!

<b>Front Seating</b>

This is where any enchantment we had with this van <b>ENDED</b>!  The front seats are narrow and uncomfortable.    Both seats are practically right up against the doors.  My husband, at 135 pounds and 5�9� inches tall, even had trouble sitting comfortably in these seats.    There is about 18 inches of open unused space between the 2 front seats, PLENTY of room to expand the seats a few inches to add comfort!!  Not only were the seats narrow, but they were very close to the dashboard!!  In case you haven�t figured it out already, I am 5�4� tall.  I had the seat pushed all the way back, and I still felt too close to the steering wheel!  The steering wheel had the tilt option, and if I pushed up as far as it would go, I was comfortable.  However, with the steering wheel all the way up, my view of the road was obstructed!!   The foot areas in the front of this van were not designed for comfort.  The wheels intrude on the outside portion of each foot well, causing a 6 inch hump.  The engine compartment intrudes from the inside side of each foot well, taking away precious space.    We both had trouble finding a comfortable spot for our left foot while driving.  My husband ended up putting his left foot <b>UNDER THE BRAKE PETAL</b>!!  No wonder I won�t let him drive very often!!  I never did find a spot that was comfy for my foot.

<b>Tow Package</b>

This van is equipped to tow a small R.V. trailer.  I am not familiar with the weight limits since we did not tow anything.    The transmission has an overdrive off option to give you the extra towing power if needed.  The side view mirrors on this van are exceptional.  They are large, and provide you with a clear view of what is behind you.  These are so large so they provide visibility while towing a trailer.

<b>How Does It Drive?</b>

It drives more like a pick up than a minivan.   Our 1999 <b>Villager</b> rides smoother than most cars, so we may be a bit spoiled.  This van does not have a good turning radius.  If you are trying to make a U-Turn, and are limited in space - FORGET IT!!  This van is also hard to park.  You will need to have 2 spaces side by side in order to have enough room to maneuver this van into one!  There is no �squeezing into a space� with this van!!  Yes, I know if I had driven it for a longer period, I would have not only had cramped legs, but I probably could have parked it better.

I would only recommend this van to a larger family who insisted on having a minivan.  Personally, I would just make the step up to a full size van.
