            I would agree with those that say you have to be a "Land Rover Discovery fan" to appreciate the Disco II.  This SUV is better by leaps and bounds over the old model.  I bought mine used and really love it-but I always wanted one.  I Bought The ACE equipped model, and would not have it any other way.  The thing handles like a sports car *no kidding!* it is absolutely amazing, but it does make the car have a unique 'noise'.  LOVE the high seating position, and how the steering wheel fits your hand perfectly (if you have ever driven one, you know what i mean).  Phenominal sound system (harmen/kardon).   

It does have drawbacks for sure.  Sorta cramped inside, GAS HOG, Dealer-only service, but these are all things that you know up front if you have done any research on this SUV.  

I would recomend this SUV to anyone who has considered it as an option.  It is very unique inside and out - to say the least, and has a style of it's own.  If you have always loved the Discovery, and are considering one, get it, you won't regret it.  

Just a warning though, prepare to have deep pockets if somthing ever goes wrong with it.
