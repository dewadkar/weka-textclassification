            In my opinion all digital cameras are only good if you have a top quality printer. When you download the film and print it will only come out nicely if the printer you have is top quality. So in addition to the price of the camera one would have to buy a printer which could cost hundreds of dollars. However, with an internet connection it is very convenient to develop the disk on your computer and send it to friends and family. Then they can't frame the picture unless they have the top quality printer. So, my opinion is that unless you are prepared to go in for the long haul and you're ready to spend a hefty sum, think about it before you buy this camera.<br><br>
