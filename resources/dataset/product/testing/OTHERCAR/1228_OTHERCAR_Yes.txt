            This is a medium performance car that I enjoy having and driving. At 136HP, I just love that overdrive button when getting on the highway. The seats can be set to be just comfortable enough to enjoy a long ride, but not too much to fall asleep on them. I admit it doesn't have a spheric, chromatic feeling like most compact cars, but it's a car that gets me from point A to point B quick and efficiently.

Living in quebec, cars need winter tires. I was using this car on all-season tires all year long, and managed to never have a single accident. I did happen to make 2 consecutive 180s in a curve when driving to my friend's house one night (a clockwise 180, the car was propelled backwards, so I hit the neutral and managed to make a counter clockwise 180 and put Drive back on). It also happened on the high way that I almost lost control, but thanks to the manoeuvrability of this car, I was able to make it safely (the same night about 20 or so accidents related to the weather were reported in the area)

This car can nicely take curves and bumps, and I feel comfortable using a constant speed in areas where most people don't, including a curve formely famous for deadly accidents. The built-in stereo is of medium class (well, it would be considered good for a '94 I guess). The cassette player had to go, so I put money aside and put in a cd player and a new antenna. New music   I get the Buzz station better than most of my friends. The speakers work great even with my new radio.

All the parts are really easy to get (all parts I need fix, I can get the very same day, even on weekends). The downside of this car is it's engine. I'm not much of a mechanic, but lots of my friends are. Since it's a japanese car, the parts are very packed together. Lucky thing my friend new a garagist who new himself in these, it took him a solid 90 minutes to fix my starter since everything was jammed up together. Other bad thing are the cup holders. I can't have a cup without blocking the vent control system ontop and the ashtray under (which my mother needs when smoking)

<b>Stats</b>
Horse Power: 136
Mileage: just over 173 000 kilometers
Common destinations: dance clubs, friends' houses, school, scouts
Quarter mile estimate time: 16 seconds
add-ons?: Sony CD Player, new Antenna


<b>Problems I had in the past year</b>
Oil pan had a crack, needed to replace it
The rubber around the wheels under the car (to prevent dirt from entering and breaking the parts) ruptured
The starter failed on me
The hood latch got stuck, so had to drive a few miles at low speed, having chances of the hood deciding to let go (just needed some WD-40 and pryers to fix, the wire was loose)
The trunk cannot be opened by inside the car, it has to be opened by key
My key is somewhat broken, the car can run, even if I take my key out while it's running


<b>Recommendations</b>
Since this is a 2-door car, it's obviously not a family car. I would say it's a practible car for going to work or groceries, and would be mostly of good usage for a single person or a couple.
Make a casual check on it and you'll be satisfied. I haven't done any checkups, and it started acting up on me
Replace that cassette player by a CD or MP3 player
