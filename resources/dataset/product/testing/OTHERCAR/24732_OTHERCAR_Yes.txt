            I am rather new in the digital camera industry.  I own the olympus 360L and I just recently purchased this Sony DSC-S70 for my office.  The reason that I purchased the DSC-S70 was because I wanted the 3.3 megapixel resolution that the camera offered.  In my line of work there is a lot of field work that takes place and I thought that the mpeg movie option would be a nice feature.  I also liked the sturdiness of the camera.

The results of the pictures so far are incredible.  Taking pictures at the highest resolution produce amazing quality for both the computer and prints.  We have an old inkjet printer (HP 1120C) and the prints that we are able to view are exceptional.  The zoom is ok though I wish that it was more than 3X.  I know that the specs say that it is a 6X zoom, but it is only 3X optical zoom and the other 3X zoom is digital.  

The camera came with an 8 MB memory stick.  This is not enough memory so I purchased a few 32 MB memory sticks.  For your personal use I would recommend purchasing the 64 MB memory stick because at the highest quality (2048 X 1536) the 32 MB memory stick can only hold approximately 20 pictures.  Downloading of the pictures is easy and fast with a USB connection.  I also Purchased a floppy disk adapter for the memory stick and this is easy to use as well.

The battery is another excellent feature of the camera.  The battery is a lithium ion battery.  It is called a infolithium battery.  The reason for this name is because the battery tells you how many minutes are left on the unit.  When recharging the battery it continues to tell you how many minutes are left.  I timed the recharge rate and it took 50 seconds to charge 1 minute of battery time.  The battery that came with the DSC-S70 is a 2.5 hour battery.  I find that this is adequate as long as it is charged after each use.  There are also more advanced adapters available for charging the battery in the car and for quicker charges, though I have not used any of these.


The biggest negative of the camera is that it is a bit large and awkward in shape.  I would recommend purchasing the the soft carrying case ($24.95) that Sony offers for this camera.  Another negative aspect of the camera is the MPEG movie option.  This option is below average in quality.  The quality even at the highest resolution is slow and blurry.  <br><br>
