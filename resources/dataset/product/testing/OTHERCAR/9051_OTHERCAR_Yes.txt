            My wife was ready to move out of our full size conversion van into a mini-SUV 4X4 to handle the midamerican winters.  We purchased the Sportage (over the CRV and Grand Vitara) primarily because of the price, appearance and front seat driver comfort.  We paid $20,000 for our 2000 EX 4X4.

We really like the driver comfort, the appearance, ease of storage in the back and relatively good gas mileage.  Comfort on the highway is very good, although road noise is higher than normal.  The items we would change include the location of the drink cup holders in front, add a button for door locks and a push button to open the rear hatch without inserting a key.  Acceleration at all speed levels is terrible, but we knew that at the outset so it really is not a complaint.

It is very comfortable and fun to drive the Sportage around town and on short road trips.  This is highly recommended for those who want a mini SUV at a very low price while enjoying good looks and a well appointed interior.  If you are planning to tow anything, I would not recommend this, nor would I advise this if you are looking for great pickup around town and power on the highway.<br><br>
