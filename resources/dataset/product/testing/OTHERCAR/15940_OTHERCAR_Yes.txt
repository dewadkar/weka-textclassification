            I recently purchased the Epson PhotoPC 650 from CompUSA for $299 after extensive research. This is a great buy! The viewfinder mode acts like a regular camera with a B &amp; W LCD Status Screen showing the quality of the images you were taking, battery life, and the amount of pictures you have. After taking a picture in this mode, the 1.8 inch Active Matrix TFT Color LCD Illuminates and displays the picture very clearly, letting you make a quick erase if necessary.
The LCD View mode Lets you see streaming status of exactly what the camera is seeing. This LCD is great because it is so powerful and clear. After taking your pictures, around 36 in Superfine mode, you simply can either review the images via the menu, slideshow, or index of 9 pictures at a time on the screen. This review mode lets you erase, see or arrange these pictures.
When hooking it up to the TV, very easily I might add, you see precise and very sharp images that are vibrant and true to life. You can record these onto a videotape in conjunction with video (for credits or anything else), or just record a slideshow so you can show your friends without a computer and not even have to print it out.
This camera comes with all three, Camera to Mac, Camera to Wintel Serial Port, and a kind of USB film reading device. I installed the USB device very easily and it was running in minutes. The last USB transfer lets you transfer images from the actual film, so you don't have to make any connections to your camera. Transferring these images were as fast, if not faster, than opening up an image already on the hard drive. The serial port is kind of slow, but not slower than any other camera, and it is easy to use. I don't Have a Mac, but I know that the Camera to Mac cable and the USB cable would work just as well on a Mac.
Finally, the images are stunning! There are precise details even at 8 by 6! This is a great camera for any professionally, family, or student. Some people are disappointed that this camera is not equipped with a zoom, but I think this is much more professional sine it has 37mm threads letting you buy your own lenses and being able to control your own zoom, unlike the HP and Olympus competitors that don't offer a USB interface, 37mm threads, or Camera to TV viewing. So far, there has not been a single better competitor to this piece of art (in technology AND style) and I would be interested to know if one comes out. For $250 - $320 this camera should belong in everybodyï¿½s pocket.
Also, I have noticed that many reviewers have commented on this cameras short battery span, that can easily be resolved for $30 which buys you two AA 4 Pack NiMH battery packs and a recharger. Make sure these are NiMh batteries though! You can get these kits from a Circuit City or Radioshack near you. And even with standard Alkalines, an approximate 8-hour battery-span is pretty good!
