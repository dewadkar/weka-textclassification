            I must  say I am the proud owner of a 2000 and a 98 Lincoln Navigator. (one I won in a contest the other I brought) This car is for the family with 2 or more children we have 4 and each child can have enough leg room to stretch out and be comfortable for those long trips.  And you can even  get one with a tv and vcr system  to keep  the kids  occupied while you are driving.  This is the kind of car that say mini van on the inside but the outside says classy.  Dont get me wrong there are some very nice looking minivans out there, but if you are like me a very hip kinda mom(lol) this is the car for you.  It also come with many features like the wireless key entry, or you if you have a garage opener you can program it into the visor of your car so you dont have to use a clicker, the car system is great too, you can control how fast you want the music to play, and you can play it in different tunes. It comes with a  cd changer some have 6 or you can get more if you like, the new models come with the new navagation system so you do get lost when you travel (like I do I live in California its a big place.)  The only problem is the gas this car has two tanks and the newer ones takes the high octane while the older models take the regular, and the tires can be pretty expensive. But other than that I love my car.
