            I'm about to put in an order for a 2001 Tahoe.  My choice is the LS trim level, in 2wd, with a minimum of "extra" options, most of which I find to be of dubious value.   We're not buying this SUV to be trendy, or haul kids and gear around.   We're buying it because the cost of safe, reasonably stylish, SAFE cars of decent size is so high they're unaffordable.  It seems you can't buy a large, safe basic car that doesn't handle like a truck or look like your grandpa should be driving it. And forget minivans.  So, for many drivers, full sized SUV's are the only viable option.

My impressions about the Tahoe and what I like about it:

Exterior:  The styling didn't impress me when I first saw photos, but it has grown on me.  It's an evolution of the previous version, with a few more curves and bulges.  The rising roof bulge at the rear is a nice effect, making it more muscular than the similar Suburban models. The main problem with these SUV's is that they are big, and GM insists on putting relatively skinny wheels and tires on them.   I have seen a few Tahoes on the road with aftermarket wheels/tires and it really improves the stance and overall look. UPDATE: I put on 17" American Racing Atlas wheels and 265/70/17 Michelin LTX M/S tires, and it looks great.  Photos available at  http://freeweb.pdq.net/macphail 

It gets lots of compliments and stares.  I like the Victory Red color, with Onyx Black as a 2nd choice(we wound up going with the Black).  The metallic colors don't do anything for me.   This is a truck, not a Lexus LS 400.
But to each his own.  The GMC Yukon varies mostly in trim and the grill.  I happen to prefer the Chevy grill and black side trim over the Yukon's oval grill and fake chrome side trim.  The Chevy also usually can be had for a little less money, in the real world.

The size of the Tahoe is perfect. You can carry up to 8 passengers with the optional 3rd row seat, yet the short wheelbase makes it easier to park and maneuver.  Small compact SUV's don't have the spacious interior and commanding size, yet most get only marginally better fuel economy and are less safe in a crash.   Optioned up, they even cost about the same as the bigger, more powerful, more capable Tahoe.  I drive an extended cab truck, and let me tell you, the Tahoe is a breeze to park and maneuver compared to a long wheelbase truck.  

Interior:  Ok, this is NOT a fancy interior. It's not bad, but it hasn't followed the trend of more upscale truck interiors.   But this is fine with me.  It's nice enough, and it fits the vehicle.   Gauges are easy to read, and I have always liked Chevy's truck interiors.  The cupholders are easy to use and reach, the console is spacious, and there is plenty of interior storage for odds and ends.  The leather is surprisingly nice for a vehicle like this, and the neutral leather looks great.   Medium gray is another color option for leather. The cloth seats also look great, but for only $750 more, the leather is a no-brainer option when you factor in resale ,durability, and best of all....stain resistance(no grape juice disasters here).

I'm big, so I really need a vehicle this big to really get comfortable.   My shoulders are too wide for most severely bolstered seats, so Chevy's wide, flat seats suit me fine.   The buttons and switches are a little plasticy, but again, this is ok in a truck based vehicle.   If you want more luxury in your 'ute, I would take a look at the new Acura MDX for hauling 7 people.  But don't get me wrong, the Tahoe does exude a feeling of luxury and comfort.   Buckets or a front bench are available, and the buckets are a choice more for style than function, since the seats feel the same to me.   The rear seats are something I won't be requiring, but they are, as expected, short-people-only seats.   (UPDATE:  the seats are even more comfortable than I expected)

The stereo has the CD player, and I find it superior to the ones in my previous Chevy, Ford, Dodge, and BMW vehicles.  Not an audiophile system, but very solid. 

The Tahoe has a featured called "retained accessory power" which means your stereo stays on even after you've pocketed the key. It only shuts down after 20 minutes or when you open the door.   This really comes in handy when you're waiting in the car.  It also has daytime running lights(which you can defeat temporarily by pushing a button three times), and the headlights automatically come on at dark and shut off when you leave the vehicle.   You never really even have to touch the headlight switch if you don't want to.

Performance:  The Tahoe rides smoothly, much better than the main competition, the Expedition (UPDATE: actually, the ride is quieter and smoother than my BMW 540i's was). It handles and brakes much like my 2000 Toyota Tundra, except that I find the suspension firmer(which I prefer) with less body roll, and the seats and leg room are much better suited to my frame.  UPDATE:  After 2 months of ownership, I find the Tahoe to feel "tippier" than the Tundra, but it is still very acceptable and was rated *** for rollover resistance, a solid score.  Braking is one area that is much improved. The old Tahoe was really weak in this area.  Acceleration is great for a big SUV, with a 0-60 time of around 8 seconds on a 2wd model w/ the 3.73 rear axle.  This feels quick, and is plenty fast enough for any truck based vehicle.  285 hp and 325 lbft of torque is really impressive.  UPDATE:  It does have to rev high to get the most out of the engine, but even at low rpm's, it is a capable performer.  Noise levels are low for an SUV, and my impression is that it would be a great trip vehicle.  

Safety:  This is one of my main areas of concern when buying a vehicle these days.   The Silverado on which the Tahoe is based scored *** on the driver side and **** on the passenger side in the govn't frontal 35mph crash tests. Not stellar, but when you factor in the 4800 lb curb weight and airbags, you're about as safe as you can be.  There are higher-rated vehicles, but most are quite a bit smaller. The side impact airbags are a first-in-class added plus.   Sitting up high also helps you avoid injury in some circumstances, and if driven skillfully, rollover shouldn't be a major concern.  

Dealers:  Based on Consumer reports, Chevy dealers have the widest variance of customer satisfaction of any make. This means that some are very good, and some are very bad. So your experience will vary based on who you deal with. Ask around and find a no-nonsense dealer interested in keeping a good reputation.   I've found that rural dealers are easier to deal with than busy suburban ones. (though some rural dealers are "old-school" and have atrocious business practices)  I have also found that the best place to buy a Tahoe is NOT at the busy dealer near the mall. (UPDATE: Ironically, this is exactly where I bought mine, they had the best price because they are trying to become a high-volume dealer) This is the SUV capital of the world.  Use the phone and the internet to find a deal at a high volume dealership in a rural area.   They will have a good selection and won't have as high a demand for trendy SUV's.   My previous dealer experience with 2 chevy trucks was fine, but I have read horror stories too.

Reliability/resale:  First of all, Tahoe resale value has been fantastic for years.  This should continue.   One reason I never bought a used Tahoe in the past was that they were poor values! They resold for too much.  This is a major factor in my purchase decision. I can buy one and sell it after 3 years and not get burned.   Or I can keep it and really save if it is a good vehicle for me.   

One way to maximize resale value is to carefully select your options. Onstar, assist steps, suspension packages, etc, add very little to what you'll get on resale, but add thousands to your purchase cost.   I have to order my Tahoe because the ones on dealer lots mostly are loaded with about $3,000!!!! more in options than I want or need.   And my Tahoe is "loaded" . So shop carefully. Do you really want some gimmick to call when you need to find a restaurant?   UPDATE:  I did manage to find a moderately equipped Tahoe on a lot, but only because it had been ordered and the buyer changed his mind.  I just got lucky finding my color/option choice on a lot.

Reliablity is the one area in which the Tahoe may well disappoint.  Reading posts on the internet, I was amazed at how many people were having problems. That said, they usually were more annoying than important, and were usually fixed under warranty w/o trouble.   Various car mags have also commented on the disappointing build quality of the Silverado and Tahoe.  The alternative is buying a Japanese make, but guess what, they dont' really make a comparable vehicle, and the few they do are either too expensive (Landcruiser/LX470) or too small(LX300/4runner/pathfinder), or both.
On a positive note, Chevys have always been easier and cheaper to fix once out of warranty.  I have seen quotes of $1250 for a 100K mile extended warranty, so you may want to consider that if you plan on keeping it for the long term. These transferrable warranties probably pay for themselves upon resale, so it's a good idea just to be sure.  
UPDATE:  My Tahoe has been trouble-free in 3500 miles.  So far, so good.  Only one minor trim item fault at delivery, and it can be fixed in about a minute.  Paint quality was higher than I expected.  

Conclusions:  The Tahoe is the newest entry in the full size SUV market, and is clearly the leader for now.   The new Sequoia by Toyota deserves a look, but is more expensive and the size really is smaller than full-size, especially from the driver's perspective.  I would recommend the Tahoe over the Ford Expedition or Dodge Durango, its main competion.  While not a sports sedan, it rides and handles well for an SUV.  If you get a "good one" with no problems, you'll definitely be happy with your choice.  
 
UPDATE SUMMARY:  So far I am pleasantly surprised at how much we enjoy the Tahoe, especially moving from a BMW 540i.  Space, ride, comfort, everything except sports-car handling are there.  I paid about $30750, $900 over invoice in January, though I hear they are going for even less now.  For that I got the LS package, running boards, leather, electric seats, bucket seats, and a couple other minor options.  I also spent another $1,000 net(sold my take-offs) on the wheel-tire upgrade.   Compare this to $37,000 for an Acura MDX(awd) or Toyota Sequoia, and it's a solid bargain.    Our dealer experience was easy and low-hassle.  Everything was done via email or phone.   It wasn't a no-haggle deal, but it wasn't unpleasant, either.
