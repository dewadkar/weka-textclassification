            My 1996 ACR Neon was quite a find -- in 4/1997, I had read about this racing and competition package Neon, but most Dodge dealers knew nothing about it.  So, after quite a few phone calls, I finally located an ACR at a dealer, drove the hour to get there, and test-drove it.  Wow!

The ACR is a bare-bones, no-options, all-power, fantastic-handling package.  Compared with the normal production Neons, they have suspension tweaks, a different engine control computer, better brakes, better engine cooling, etc., etc.  While mine was built to be a race car, I have absolutely no discomfort driving it to and from work.  Dodge introduced the R/T Neon later, which basically took the ACR and added creature comforts (like a sunroof, air conditioning, a radio, power windows, and so forth). The R/T is a nice package but the extra weight of all of these extras makes it a touch slower.

Regardless, I've had my ACR for about 70,000 miles, only one "problem" -- a faulty head gasket, the repair cost for which was underwritten by DaimlerChrysler Customer One.  I was more than happy with the arrangement as the car was not under warranty at the time.

Overall -- very reliable, great handling, good in the snow, very comfortable (the ACR 'national champion interior package' includes the most supportive seats I've ever owned).  If you're looking for a fuel-efficient car that you can really have fun with, I'd recommend the ACR wholeheartedly.

UPDATE (July 2002): My '96 Neon ACR now has reached 110,000 miles. It's been fine with normal maintenance items (I have replaced the original Arvin struts with adjustable Koni struts, similar to those which were included on the 1997-1999 ACRs as original equipment, and am currently due for a brake job and to replace the front motor mount). There's also a slight click in the steering column that I will need to track down - but considering the car is about six years old and has 110,000 miles on it, these are not alarming issues. The car has absolutely no rust. Oil consumption is negligible. And, after recently following the factory procedure to remove the accumulated carbon from the cylinder head, the car's just as lively to drive as the day it was new. I continue to be very happy with this little machine, and expect it to be around for quite some time.
