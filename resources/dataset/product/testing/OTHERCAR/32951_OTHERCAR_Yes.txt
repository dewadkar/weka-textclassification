            There was a front-page story in  <i> USA Today </i> a couple of weeks ago (16 August 2002) about how airlines are feeling the pinch as short-hop passengers decide to drive instead of putting up with the longer lines and waits at the airports. One of the connections used as an example was the Dallas/Fort Worth - Austin route, where passenger travel is down about 25% in the past year. Strangely enough, I was driving back to Austin from Dallas that very day - looks as though Southwest Airlines misses me! In truth, I spend a lot of time - more than I really want to - driving back and forth between my home base in Austin and the two major metropolitan areas of Texas, Houston and DFW. That particular week was a toughie - I left Austin on Tuesday morning for Houston, worked in a client's office 'til 5:30, and then took off for Dallas - the great triangle route, if you will. For my chariot that week, the fine folks at Enterprise had put me in a 2001 Mitsubishi Montero Sport LS (2WD); the smaller of the company's two SUV models. Trust me, I got well acquainted with the critter in about 750 miles of driving, especially that 450-mile day on Tuesday!


<b>The Walkabout</b>

Unlike its larger brother the Montero, the Montero Sport is a low profile, truck-based brand of SUV, built on the frame Mitsu uses for its line of compact pickups. It's quite the attractive beast from the outside, in fact. Brutishly handsome lines, a wide stance, and a low roofline are highly reminiscent of the Toyota 4Runner; another truck-based SUV. The LS version I drove was a dark silver finish with dark gray plastic trim on the fender flares and bumpers. The rear hatch, which - unlike the Montero's side-hinged door - opens upward, is done in black glass and plastic; and a stark black grille with V-shaped designs features the three-diamond logo. Wide tires on stylish 16-inch alloy wheels are also included in the LS model, as are matte gray side steps. All told, it makes an attractive package to gaze upon.

The interior of the LS model takes more of a plain-jane approach: surfaces are mainly dark gray plastic and vinyl, with enough texture to keep them from looking overly cheap. The fabrics in my ride were all in lighter grays with a suede-like texture that unfortunately seemed (from looking at a vehicle with 30K miles on it) to hold stains rather well; seats and carpeting alike. The rear seat is split 60:40 (the short side's behind the driver) with a fold-down armrest in the middle, and the rear cargo area comes with a color-matched window-shade style tonneau cover. 

The space under that cargo cover is, however, quite limited - fourteen inches high - by the spare tire mounted under the frame. There are a pair of small, lidded trays in the floor of the cargo compartment, neither of which is more than three inches deep. Up front you'll find storage in a medium-sized glove compartment, a dash compartment (sized for cassettes) and the usual door and seat-back pockets.


<b>Being a Driver</b>

The Montero Sport's cockpit is defined by high-backed bucket seats separated by a tall console. The floor-mounted shifter rides well to the front of the "hump," and a parking brake lever occupied the right-hand side of the floor unit. In 4WD models, the selector sits to the left of the shifter. The floor unit has cup holders and a couple of nooks (for cell phone, parking card, etc.) molded into the plastic. You'll find two 12V power sockets at the base of the dash, one of which is fit out as a lighter - there's a third built into the wall of the cargo compartment.

The console unit is tall and narrow, and has been placed at an awkward position for a medium-sized driver: too far back, too low for an elbow rest. It's divided into an upper and lower compartment, with change slots and the like in the top and a well large enough for CDs in the bottom. The latch on mine - a cheesy nylon friction setup - was broken and the top rattled annoyingly. 

Controls are well thought-out and well placed, with cruise control, wipers, and lighting functions grouped on three separate control stalks (unlike that nasty GM thing). Everything is within easy reach of yours truly, a quintessential average-sized adult male. The instrument panel has an interesting touch, with black lettering on white dials for the speedometer and tach; the remaining gauges are standard black background. Since Mitsubishi insists on putting the shift selector in the center of the instrument panel, those major gauges end up a tad on the small side, but remain readable. We medium and short people will find that the field of view is very good, especially as augmented by large side view mirrors. Taller drivers, though, may find that low roofline a bit restrictive, claustrophobic even.

Front bucket seats are manually adjusted, with front-back slide, rear tilt, and a wierd little lever for raising and lowering the seat. Seating itself is average, with moderate comfort and lateral support, but minimal lumbar support. After about seven total hours in the seat, I was a bit stiffer than I'd like. Rear seating is nominally for three, though like most truck-based SUVs the three should already know each other fairly well. Legroom isn't much of a problem, but hip, shoulder, and headroom are not especially generous.


<b>The Driving Experience</b>

It's definitely a truck-based SUV, and Mitsubishi has not gone to great lengths to disguise the Montero Sport as a passenger car. The jittery ride fairly shouts "Truck!" especially over rough roads. While not much different from the Toyota 4Runner in fore-and-aft motion over bumps, the vehicle displays an irksome side-to-side motion over rough roads that might give some passengers a queasy stomach. The suspension handles smooth roads well, but any rough spots are instantly noticeable inside the cab as you sway from side to side. Especially bad bumps might find you exploring your neck for signs of whiplash.

From a performance view, the Montero Sport has adequate handling for a vehicle of its type. It handles well at low speeds, though I noticed a tendency to lane drift at higher speeds. This last may be a function of a somewhat aggressive approach to variable power assisted steering. Braking is average to good, with minor pedal fade noted in stop and go situations. I didn't notice any particular body sway during maneuvers except for a slight top-heaviness when cornering at higher speeds; again, a common failing of the class. Pitted against others I've driven, the Montero Sport was about average for the class, with the Liberty and 4Runner better and the Xterra slightly worse. The driver maintains a good road feel at lower speeds, somewhat less so at freeway velocities.

Acceleration might best be described as lackadaisical. The 3.0-litre V6 puts out a somewhat low 165 horsepower (a 4Runner's V6 puts out 184). The torque distribution appears to favor street and off-road speeds, as there's more power in the lower end of the range. You'll get good acceleration away from the lights and up the freeway ramps, but don't look for a scintillating burst of speed to get around some road hog semi on a two-lane highway. As it so often is, gas mileage proves a trade-off with performance. EPA estimates for the vehicle are 17 / 21 (city / highway), I got about 19 MPG in mixed driving and almost 22 MPG in a stretch of pure freeway driving.


<b>Safety</b>

Standard safety features on the LS package include anti-lock brakes, dual front airbags, traction control, and a full complement of LATCH points. Side airbags are not available on this trim.


<b>Amenities</b>

The LS trim comes with the usual plethora of little servo motors to ease your driving experience. There are power windows, mirrors, and remote-control door locks with alarm standard, along with optional features like the rearview mirror group (compass/thermometer and auto-dimming sensor). You'll also find a standard AM/FM/Cassette with single-disc CD player, which puts out adequate sound. Optional sound systems are, I presume, of better quality. 

The standard air conditioning had a difficult time staving off that fabled Texas heat and humidity during the daytime, but when the sun was out of sight it worked just fine. At this trim level there is only rudimentary control over the airflow, though more expensive trim levels have rear seat controls.


<b>Fit and Finish</b>

For a vehicle with only 30K miles on it, the vehicle had a large assortment of clicks, creaks, groans and rattles. A couple of parts were missing - not all that unusual for rentals - but these did not contribute to the noise all that much. I heard consistent rattles out of the rear end on even mildly coarse roads, and a couple of bangs and clunks out of the suspension over bigger hurdles (speed bumps and the like). The body finish seemed to me to be quite acceptable, and I didn't note any cosmetic blemishes. Some internal parts seem poorly made <I>e.g.</I>, console latch, sunvisors, and tonneau cover), and the folding mechanism for the rear seats proved very stiff. The headrests on the rear seat resisted removal strenuously, meaning that the seats wouldn't fold at all. 

Interior noise is substantial, though not all that different from other vehicle in the class (4Runner, Xterra, Liberty). Wind noise seemed the worst under normal driving conditions, though under heavy acceleration engine howl is pretty annoying. 


<b>Overall Recommendations</b>

A good-looking truck - the Montero Sport is undeniably a truck - that tails off in the performance, handling, and build quality areas. Those more interested in style than substance should be able to find a good bargain on used versions of the Montero Sport; those interested in a long-term relationship with a vehicle may wish to take a closer look at competing import (Xterra, 4Runner) or domestic models (Liberty, Trailblazer).
