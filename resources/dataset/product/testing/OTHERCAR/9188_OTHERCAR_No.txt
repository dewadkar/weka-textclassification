            This car is a couch on wheels.  That can be good or bad depending on your view.  This car simply glides over smooth pavement, and is a great highway cruiser.  Over rough pavement this car bobs and floats, and intrusions are very rather harshly.  Also, don't even think about driving this car quickly on a twisty mountain road, the brakes are not very good, and the tires squeal too easily.

Acceleration is adequate at speed, though seems slow off the line.  This doesn't fit the characteristic for pushrod engines, which usually provide gobs of low-end power, but lack high-end kick.  The engine is very smooth though, and relatively quiet.  Newer models have an additional 35 horsepower (205 total), and accelerate much more quickly.  It should be noted that the 3800 engine has been around for a long time, and has had all of its &quot;bugs&quot; worked out.  This means that the engine will nut suffer any unexpected problems that newer engines sometimes do.  Also, with only 170hp coming from 3.8 liters, the engine is not under a lot of pressure, which translates into longer life.

LOVES:
Smooth ride on smooth highways
Interior Room (6 footers can cross their legs in back)
Reliability (Zero unscheduled trips to the shop in 6 years, 90K+ miles)
Fuel economy (about 24+ in mixed driving)

HATES:
Handling
Interior styling
Ribbon-style speedometer


This car is excellent for long trips and is a very good car for tall families.  The back seat is bigger than nearly everything else on the market (save for the Mercedes S-Class, but that's different).  

I highly recommend this car for people that want a smooth cruiser and don't drive very twisty roads often.

I do not recommend this car for anyone who wants a sporty car.
