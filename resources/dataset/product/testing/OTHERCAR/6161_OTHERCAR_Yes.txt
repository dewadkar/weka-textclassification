            I did a lot of research when it came time for us to buy a minivan and I am VERY happy with my decision to buy a Chevy Venture.  This van fits 7 people and loads of cargo.  There's even an option for a middle seat that fits 3 making room for 8!  Ours has 4 doors which is very convenient with 2 children.  The passenger sliding door is remote controlled which is absolutely wonderful when it's raining.  I can open the door from at least 100 feet away!  

The back seats are very accessible without everyone climbing all over each other.  There's lots of cup holders and storage spaces, it handles very well, and drives like a car.  There is a lot of legroom and the seats are very comfortable.  It's a great vehicle at a great price with lots of options.  

The seats are very light and the rear ones fold up next to the middle ones making lots of room in the back without having to remove the seats.  The rear seats also slide forward, allowing for more room for cargo in the back.<br><br>
