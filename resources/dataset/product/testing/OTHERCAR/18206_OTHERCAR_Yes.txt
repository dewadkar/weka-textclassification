            PROS:
The DX6340 has HANDS DOWN the cleanest user interface of any camera out there.  Menus are easy to read, and you can select  functions based on FULL WORDS rather than millions of tiny icons.  I am very happy with the picture quality, and the  setting for Best *** 3:2 works perfect for 4x6 prints.  This aspect ratio for pictures prevents any cropping by your film  developer.  The software that comes with the product is highly useable and robust and is free to share with your friends  and family.  It has all the manual features of any digital camera in its class, and the NiMH batteries I use give me over  300 pictures per 2AA batteries with flash and LCD on!  THE BEST FEATURE THIS CAMERA HAS, though, is its ability to 'share'  a photo you just took as an email.  So, you just took a picture of your friends baby and they want a copy, just hit the  share button and select their email from the list.  When you sync the camera, all email tagged pictures will automatically  come up as an attachment in an email addressed to all the people you selected on the camera.  ALSO GREAT is the ability to  assign the pictures to albums right on the camera.  These album tags will translate to your albums on the computer for  easier organization.  You can even assign an album to pictures you have yet to take... so if taking baby pictures for an  hour, you can select the baby album and all pictures you take will automatically make it to that album when sync'd with  the computer.  EASE OF USE IS 5 star!!! I would have designed the menus in the exact same way!!!  Good Job *finally*  Kodak!  Dont be afraid of this camera because of the name Kodak, they made up for past mistakes with this beauty.  Also  the mouse button is fantastic.... every camera should have one of these rather than 4 direction keys like most.  Color  reproduction is excellent and in side by side 40 picture shoot test with canon A70, the Kodak outperformed image quality  over the canon in 90% of pictures. (my personal test)  Especially color saturation was MUCH better on the kodak, though it  did tend to make some objects slightly brighter than they should be.  Also takes pictures in much faster succession than  the highly touted 'digic' processor in the canon.  I currently experience no shutter lag at all, but I do have to wait if  I want the flash (as every other camera flash does)

Cons:
1) Movie mode is horrible (just like every other digital camera)  Even the canons with their 640x480 movie mode, they  still have only 15fps which is poor for video viewing.  If you want moving videos you have to get a digital camcorder.   Even the cheapest digital camcorder will run circles around the most expensive digital camera.  Or, do like I do, and just  keep your analog camcorder and buy a tv capture card for the pc... works great.  2) no uncompressed picture mode.  (not  necessary for 4x6, but would be nice for 8x10)  By the way I have ordered many 8x10 prints with this camera, and they turn  out very well ( as well as any 35mm camera would do on an 8x10.)
