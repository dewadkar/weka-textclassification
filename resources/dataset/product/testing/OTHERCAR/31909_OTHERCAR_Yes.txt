            When we first went to the Subaru dealership, the intent was to get an Impreza � something zippy, smaller than a Volvo station wagon, and with AWD to keep me safe on Connecticut roads. What we ended up with was entirely different � a Forester L � and I couldn�t be happier with the switch.

The Forester has its faults, as with any car. After spending 4 consecutive hours driving, I came to the conclusion that the seats lacked for long distance comfort � the lumbar support is not as comforting as originally thought on short trips. The leg room, too, can be stifling for taller drivers (my boyfriend is 6� 3�, and has troubles driving my Forester for long periods of time because his legs get crammed up against the gear shift column � though this is still a better experience than he had with the Rav4).  Slightly irritating is the fact that you are not supposed to use the cruise control until the car has been run for 3750 miles, and on extremely hot days the A/C isn�t as cold as we have found American-made car A/C to be. It can also be a bit of an adjustment getting used to its <i>extremely</i> peppy accelerator.

However, the Forester is above and beyond the nicest SUV I�ve driven in a long time. After a history of Jeep Grand Cherokees and Lexus RX300s, the Subaru Forester�s peppy zip (some might call it a touchy accelerator, similar to the Lexus but I think its fun and less touchy than that) and tight turning circle is a Godsend! It�s wonderful being able to have the visibility associated with an SUV while still being able to park reasonably and without taking up three parking places in the process. I love the fact that I can actually �do a u-ey� rather than always having to resort to the three-point turn, which in the Lexus RX300 is actually a four or five point turn. The handling is smooth; Connecticut roads being what they are, I can tell you those curvy roads are no matches for the Forester, even when combined with high-degree inclines. The breaking is excellent � very responsive while not being jerky, and the headroom is spacious. If you are eco-conscious, the gas mileage is excellent for its class, getting approx. 27-mi./gallon highway and 22-mi./gallon city.

I also bought the single disc CD player for my Forester, and have been fairly pleased with it. While the bass range isn�t as extensive as I had hoped (no, I�m not listening to rap, only country) � there is a rattle when the volume is above 7 and is playing certain country songs � the sound reproduction quality otherwise is nice, and the deck is easy to use. 

If you�re looking for a small, fun, ZIPPY SUV with excellent safety features and a good record, the Subaru Forester won�t disappoint. Take it for a test drive and compare it with the other cars I mentioned (particularly the Lexus RX300� I can�t say enough about how disappointed I was in this car!), and you�ll see it�s a head above the rest. It�s a great �first car� for teen drivers, as its still �cool looking�, while not being too big and still being extremely safe.
