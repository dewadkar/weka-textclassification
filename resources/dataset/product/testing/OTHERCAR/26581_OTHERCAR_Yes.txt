            OK, if you don't know this I'm very partial to Toyotas.  This does not mean that I don't like other cars / trucks, it just means that if I'm going to buy something it will be a Toyota, probably.  Kinda miffed about the fact there is no diesel offered in the Tundra, but patience may be all I need.

Since we just bought our 4Runner, well a year ago now but still new to us, I was a little upset about the new 4Runner coming out.  For this reason alone, I decided I had to go check it out.

Engine & Drivetrain:  The new 4Runner comes with the 4.7L V8 engine found in the Tundra.  There's also a V6 base engine that has more power (definitely needed it) than my 2001.  I'm not saying I'm unhappy with my 3.4L, but if Toyota is going to continue to be a top seller, they can't rest on their laurels, and 180 hp just doesn't cut it anymore.

I fell in love with the 4.7L V8 when I test drove the Tundra.  This SUV was no exception.  There's just something you have to love about a V8.  Well, you might not have to, but I do.  Although because of the extra weight the performance wasn't as quick as the Tundra, it still came off the line very strong.  You can tell that this is going to be a strong puller.  Idle is smooth and quiet.  The numbers on this are:  235 hp and 320 lb/ft of torque.

The V6 has more horsepower at 245, but the torque numbers are lower at 282.  I have not had a chance to drive the V6 yet, but I'm impressed by the numbers.

Transmission is a 5-speed automatic on the V8, and a 4-speed auto on the V6.  The 5-speed was very smooth, and shifted almost like a Lexus.

Interior:  This is where the 4Runner shines over it's predecessor.  I love this interior and there is a ton more room.  A lot of thought went into this new interior, and it's definitely more suited toward taller / larger drivers and their passengers.

The driver's cockpit was very comfortable.  On par with the larger Tundra / Sequoia.  The seat adjusts 8 ways, 4 for the passenger, and there's plenty of headroom for me, at 6'.  Also the width of the seat is much better.  In our 2001, I feel almost cramped by the high seat bolsters on each side.  The 2003 is much more comfortable, but I don't know how well the seat would hold you in a high-speed (emergency) maneuver.

Cargo:  The cargo area also seemed plentiful.  With the seats up you get 42.2 cu. ft. of space, and 75.1 cu. ft. with the rear seats down.  They also have an ingenious "double-decker" system, but that cuts down on the cubic feet.  Seemed like a really good idea to me.

Options:  You can option this out to your heart's content, or keep it base.  I prefer the Limited.  It's a lot easier on the eyes considering it doesn't come with the Chevy Avalanche / Pontiac Aztek matte gray paneling on the side.  I'm not a fan of that.  For more information on the rest of the options go to http://www.toyota.com.

Overall:  I love the ride of this SUV.  I always feel that a truck, or a vehicle claiming to be truck-like, should have a very stiff, but strong ride.  There is no reason for an SUV, which has such a high center of gravity, to handle like the car.  I test drove the Pathfinder a while back and it almost scared me when I shook the wheel on the freeway.

I really like the ideas that went into this vehicle.  I think Toyota really put on their thinking caps and came up with some new ideas.  I do not like the exterior.  The square wheel wells, and the gray plastic are a complete turn-off for me.  I just can't get past it.  I'll keep my 2001, but recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind the styling.

Anyway, that's my $.02.
