            Mitsubishi Diamante ES (1998)

PROS:
Sharp-looking, roomy, smooth and relatively quiet with a powerful engine.

CONS:
Poor-quality door glass has excessive optical distortion.  I had my front, driver-side window replaced under warranty but the replacement glass was just as bad.  Wind-noise around the A-pillars and mirrors is slightly louder than I'd like.  Also there were wind-leaks on both rear windows due to a poorly-designed rubber seal.  The factory brake rotors are junk and expensive to replace - the "white box" rotors I bought at 40,000 miles were MUCH better quality. In 50,000 miles, I've had two sets of engine oil leaks repaired under warranty which, added to the expensive brake repairs, doesn't bode well for ownership costs after the  60-month/60,000 mile warranty runs out.

BOTTOM LINE:  Not as well made as rivals from Honda and Toyota, this car is roomier and less expensive while still providing a smooth, quiet ride and competent handling with a near-luxury look and feel.  Reliability is only average and factory parts are more expensive than Honda and Toyota leading to higher insurance premiums.  Sluggish sales may translate into steep discounts and rebates late in the model year.
