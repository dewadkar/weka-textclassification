            I had a 1989 Chevy pickup that was a great vehicle. My family outgrew
it and we decided to get a new extended cab truck.  No doubt in my mind
that we would stay with Chevy, and the new style of the Silverado really
appealled to us.  So, we took the plunge on a new 1999 last Spring.
Ordered it from the factory through a local dealer and it took 8 weeks
to arrive (which is normal).
This is an awesome truck.  Got the 4.8L V8, LS package, and Z-71 and
other options.  The truck is very comfortable with the biggest back seat
space (we did look at Ford and Dodge - they don't compare in roominess
and comfort).  Very plush interior with many comfort features.  We 
really like the CD system.
The biggest surprise of all though is the gas mileage.  I consistently
get 19-20 mpg overall.  Haven't had it on a long trip yet, but I'm sure
I'll get a little higher on the highway.  Most of my commute is flat,
country roads, about 25 miles each way. My old truck had a 4.3L six,
and it only got 17 mpg!
If you are considering a new truck, get this one.  You won't regret it!<br><br>
