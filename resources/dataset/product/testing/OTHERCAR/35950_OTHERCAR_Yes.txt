            A car is a tool. I always think like this. I will never be fond of it. It just helps me to travel. The most important thing about a tool is do what it suppose to do. 

I like my Honda Civic LX,although I might pay a little bit more for it.

I bought it because I want to have a reliable car. And after 14 months, I can say it indeed is a reliable car. There are so many fancy cars in the market. But I like the feeling that whenever you need it, my civic will be there. And it never complains about anything. Runs smooth. 

Some people says that Honda Engine give loud noise. I also found that. Accord is much better than Civic but also gives some engine noise when speeding. But I don't really care about this. In most cases, it is quite.

Another problem with Civic is the power. Especially when you open AC, it just can't go faster in a short period of time. 

As to gas consuming, I can drive to New Jersey and back to DC with one full tank. (4 hours one way).
Also remember this is compact car, so don't really want the inside space will be big.<br><br>
