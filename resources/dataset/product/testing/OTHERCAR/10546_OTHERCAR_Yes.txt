            Although I am not old enough to actually drive our Voyager, I have spent many hours in the back seats with my sister, driving to school, sports, and other various teenage events. So if you are looking at this car for use as a family vehicle, this is the review for you. The two back  seats are very comfortable, spacious enough for my sister and me (both around 6'0") to stretch out and sleep on family trips. However, it was on one such family trip to Las Vegas when the transmission on the van broke down halfway to the destination. It cost $1500 to fix and cut 2 days off of our vacation time. Then later the same year, the air conditioner and the gas gauge stopped functioning properly about the same time. The price of repairs on that was about $600. Overall, I think this would be a great car for a family who does not travel much, as that is when things started going wrong with our car. For the couple with young kids and lots of local driving, the Voyager is an excellent choice.
