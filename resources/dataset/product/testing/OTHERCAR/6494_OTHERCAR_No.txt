            The following is a letter I wrote to Kodak's customer service department which describes my experience with this camera.

Although the retail price was higher than the $200.00 I paid for the camera, I purchased it utilizing a trade-up special they were currently running...although as you can see from the review it wasn't much of a trade-up.

I've got to say that I am totally disappointed in my experience with the DX3600. I "traded up" to this camera on the recommendation of one of your support staff when my DC280 (which I was THRILLED with) suddenly lost its ability to take a picture in focus. I was told about all the great new features that made this camera even better than the 280.

Well, I was VERY misinformed. Over the past year, I have tried to convince myself that this was the right decision. But the picture quality isn't NEARLY as good or consistent as the 280 was. The menus are so unbelievably cumbersome to navigate through when the buttons on the 280 were much more convenient (the self-timer feature is a prime example...what a PAIN to implement with the 3600!).

While the autofocus is not "broken" on the 3600, I never really know how my picture is going to look until I bring it up on the computer screen. Its performance is VERY inconsistent.

And while the 3600 is very light, it is also extremely frail! The battery compartment "lid" broke almost immediately, and we have had to use TAPE to keep it on and the batteries in!

And the battery life is an absolute joke.

I LOVED my DC280, and I wanted a legitimate replacement. I actually ended up paying for a "downgrade", in my opinion. 

I used to be quite the "Kodak Advocate" based on my experience with the 280, and prompted several other folks to buy one, my mother included. However, my recommendation will most certainly stop after this experience unless there is some way that Kodak can make this "right".

You know, I rarely take the time to write "complaint letters", but I really depend on my digital camera. I attend alot of events, and I have a young family. I absolutely hate "wondering" how the picture is going to look when I bring it up on the screen. That's the "old way"...I used to worry about that with traditional developing. Digital photography is supposed to eliminate that, and it certainly did with the 280. 

The 3600, although it has more "features" (most of which, like the "video" aren't used - or like the cumbersome menu choices, are extolled as benefits, but actually slow the picture-taking process down tremendously), this camera is a step backwards in my opinion.
