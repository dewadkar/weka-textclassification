            I've had my 1997 Chevy Cavalier since it was new, and although it's driven from Kansas to Dallas multiple times, and has even endured a trip to California and back, I've only managed to put 36,000 miles on it. Most cars with this amount of mileage still basically look and feel like new, but my Cavalier has disappointed me in how fast it seemed to have aged past the 20,000 mile mark.  I've had problems with my brakes already -- about 10,000 miles ago the discs had to be replaced, and even now that they've been fixed, I still occasionally feel that the anti-lock braking system is not working properly.  It sometimes knocks and jerk when I stop a little too quickly.  Kind of scary.
Aside from the brakes, I've only had to have minor repairs on my car, but for a car that is virtually new, I've considered them excessive.  Among these problems were a corroded battery connector cable that left my car dead in the parking lot, and a knocking noise in the air conditioner that required a new motor.  

On a more positive note, I've really enjoyed some of the aspects of my car over the past four years.  At the top of my list, the highway gas mileage is exceptionally good.  It even got better as the car accumulated more miles.  The back seats, while not exceptionally comfortable, are spacious, a feature that has been helpful to me, since I'm a college student who has had to move my stuff around a lot.  The trunk is also very roomy, and although I've never had to use this myself, the back seat folds down to extend the trunk space into the back of the car.  All of the 'extras', such as power windows, locks, sun roof, etc. have been in perfect working condition since I've owned my car.  If you're thinking about getting a Cavalier, I recommend getting one with the remote door and trunk opener-- it's made me feel more secure in some scary situations, and the battery on the remote lasts forever.  I haven't had to replace mine yet. 

My Cavalier is equipped with dual airbags, which is a wonderful safety feature to have on a small car, but I have read bad things about the danger of side impact collisions.  For the time being, I guess I consider this an acceptable risk, but I'll be looking for a car with a stronger frame in the future.  For getting me back and forth to college and around Dallas for the past four years, my car has been acceptable, but I definately won't be getting a similar model again when I can afford a car of my own.
