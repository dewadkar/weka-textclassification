            My brother bought this car for I believe about $40,000 and when I heard so my jaw dropped to the floor, I asked him if he was nuts and he simply replied, &quot;get in&quot;. I am a changed man, this car has the qualities that everyone should look for luxury, appearance, handling.... Of course there are downfalls in every plan and on this one the only one that comes to mind is cost. Of course not everybody has the money to go out and buy this car but if you do put the price in the back of your mind because this car will please you. Great buy, Great fun..Again BMW comes through as expected with an A+ car.<br><br>
