            I remember as a kid, I wanted a camera.  So, "santa" brought me a very cheap little Vivitar 110.  Kind of a camera's version of a teething ring.  It was great to start with, but naturally as I grew up I wanted something better.

Same thing applies here.  Sometime back, I wanted a digital camera.  Well, they were so expensive it seemed cost prohibitive to get one.  Then WalMart had this on sale for $220.  Wow, what a price.  It works well.  Really it does.  The software is easy to use, it takes good pictures if you spend a little bit of time on taking them.  But, bring along a fanny pack full of batteries.

That's really my biggest problem with it.  Film is cheaper than batteries are!  Anyway, naturally I'll pass it along to my kids and get a better one.  I might get the same brand, I don't have a problem with Poloroid.  I just want something with a bit more storage capacity and that doesn't go through batteries like my kids go through candy.
