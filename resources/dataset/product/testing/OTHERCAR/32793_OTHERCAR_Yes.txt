                The corrvette has always been a great car. I have owned corvettes 

before. And this one is the best so far. the other corvettes, though fun, 

have thrown you around the car. The new 2000 corvette addresses that. It 

is no longer punishing to drive one of these babies. and with a 350 hp V8 

engine this baby can get from 0-60 in 5.6 seconds. This car prvides eager 

acceleration. The price is also one great deal. This car's base price is  

$38,000! Thats great! In my opinion this is the best deal in years. I 

would recommend the hardtop version because of it's great price. The 

reliability of this car is average and the satisfaction has been given 

high marks. Personally I haven't seen a car this great since the corvette 

stingray. The big competitors to this car are Porche's boxster, honda's 

s2000 and bmw's z3. The corvette literally leaves these guys in their 

dust. So if you are looking for a good car really soon get the corvette. 

It is a great car that wont let you down in a race or just a joy ride. <br><br>
