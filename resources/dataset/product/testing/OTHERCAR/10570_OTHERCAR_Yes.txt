            Originally, I went to the car dealer to exchange windshield wipers. Four years have past since really considering any car deals. Yea, right.... 

After purchasing the wipers, I saw a car dealer I haven't seen in years. We spoke for a while and started comparing what the market has to offer and changes on the Neon. 

Since I bought the 98 Neon Sport, really not been satisfied with the 2000 through 2002 models. 2003 Fire Red Neon on the showroom floor caught my eye. Looking at it briefly and noticed it had the same similar features as the one before it but this one had a grill instead un-like the older models. 

A Blaze Red Crystal Pearl but I'll settle with Fire Red. I found a Dodge Neon SXT unexpectedly. Yea right! Denial again? Whatever!

This car has a Dark Slate Gray Interior Color. Seats are Cloth Low Back Bucket carrying a 2.0L 4 CYL SOHC 16V SMPI.  

The Transmission is a 4-Spd. Automatic. (Shh, it's a Gas hog) 

It came with the standard features: 

Air Bags-Front, Next Generation. Restraint-Unique Child Tether, Seat Belt-Rear Center, 3-Point, Sentry Key Theft Deterrent System, Locks-Rear Door Child Protection       Steering-Power Rack and Pinion, Brakes-Power Front Disc/Rear Drum   Suspension-4 Wheel Independent, Stabilizer Bar-Front   Spare Tire-Compact, Fuel Tank-12.5 Gallon, Inside Emergency Trunk Lid Release, Battery-450 Amp Maintenance Free    Windshield Glass-Tinted, Defroster-Rear Window  Windshield Wiper-Var intermittent

Typical things found on a New Vehicle.

(Cool) 

At first glance I saw the improvement with the Sport Model. Financial approval took less than an hour and the payments are less than what I was paying on the 98 Neon. Interest is a forbidden subject. 

Included is the undercoating as well the Exterior Coating for paint chip resistant that works. I found this out after some people opened their door and slammed it into my car in the parking lot at a store. (Typical I don't care kids) 

Also included is a 7-year 70k mile warranty bumper to bumper. The features of this car, the way it handles on the road are smooth and quiet.  I put seat covers and additional floor mats included. 

A beneficial decision to upgrade what Chrysler has to offer with better quality and service than several years ago I did notice. This car handles better than the 98 Neon. Changes are the keyless entry. The suspension system, the sport look is sharper with the spoiler though the Fog Lamps are a bit more reserved. The Bucket Seats are comfortable. Also installed Splash Guards. 

Gas mileage is 25/32 carrying a Multipoint Fuel Injection. The 4-Speed Auto-Transmission W/Lockup Torque Converter. 

I think for the long haul, this car will serve its purpose. I'm happy with the cars performance as well the cost to purchase. This car handles better, is quiet with the additional under coating. Still getting used to the car but at this point, a sharp looking car (better than the older versions) and performance. (Still a gas hog) 

The keyless Entry is a plus. There is a Panic Button on the Keyless in case parking lot hides the car. Pushing that button, the headlights flash and horn will go off repeatedly making a bunch of racket. Don't use it much. 

Hopeful rare decision pushing that button. 

Eventually, a different set of tires from Les Schwab. Road huggers tire all weather with warranties. I found that plays a big part on saving gas in the long run tires.  

Interested in Dodge Neon? Go check the SXT Model and compare. With time and getting used to the features, this car has unexpected qualities. 

The Interior is black cloth and gray dash with a tan upper/ceiling. A different console paint job as the exterior has. Once I figured out the differences with the controls, (lights, fans, stereo etc). (Happy happy) 

Seats are easily adjustable with a pull-up bar behind the calf. The cars handles corners so slow down or violate the yellow line can be avoided. 

Doors seem secure though there is an air bubble inside the car so a bit more of a pull on the doors to seal properly. Dome light indicator will show that. 

The 98 had the same issue. When on city streets half peddle works better than flooring the peddle for acceleration. This vehicle was designed to do that. 

Driving uphill takes off well. Cruises quite with a smooth stability back roads and highway. The stereo I intend on replacing with an equalizer. The factory makes upgradeable stereos that will replace the current one with warranty if I remember correctly. The sunroof is still nice to have as my last car did. The body style better the more I look at it. A sharp design with more/less reserve.
