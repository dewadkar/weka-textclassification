            There has never been a better time to buy a digital camera, especially an entry-level pont�n�shoot model. Prices are way down (well below half of what they were averaging just two years ago) and popular features that were commanding prices in the $1000 range as little as three years ago are available today for less than three hundred bucks. The digital camera wars are rapidly shifting from the advanced amateur/serious photographer front and aiming straight at the heart of the highly profitable 35mm snapshooter/casual photographer market niche.  There are lots of new easy to use camera models hitting the stores; cameras that are designed to introduce a whole new generation of photographers to the pleasures of digital photography.  In other words purchasers don�t have to be either computer geeks or semi-pro photographers to maximize their digital photography options.

Kodak, Olympus, Sony, Nikon, Canon, and others are trying very hard to maintain profitability in a soft economy by offering simple to operate, feature rich, and economically priced entry-level models that are designed to attract traditional 35mm auto everything point�n�shoot customers to the burgeoning ranks of digital photographers. Manufacturers are utilizing proven technology, components that were pioneered on their higher priced models, and volume manufacturing to market these cameras at a lower per unit cost. This perspective shift makes good business sense in the bloated high technology marketplace because it benefits consumers by passing these savings along to purchasers.  The recently introduced Powershot A20 is a perfect example of this new marketing philosophy.  Canon�s little point�n�shoot auto everything picture taker really delivers; in fact the A20 may end up becoming the poster child for the newest generation of cameras to emerge from the constantly evolving digital imaging revolution.

Hardly a week goes by that I don�t get a couple of requests to recommend the best digital camera deal available in a certain price/feature range.  Beth, a lady I know, recently asked me if I would help her select her first digital camera.  She is divorced and living alone for the first time since she was in college (more than twenty years ago). Her only child is grown and on his own, so she has a lot of time on her hands.  She recently bought her first computer, got hooked up to the World Wide Web, and suddenly can�t do without her daily Internet fix.  She wanted a digital camera so she could send pictures with her emails, and maybe post some items on e-bay from time to time. 

I asked her all the standard questions; will she be enlarging any of her photos beyond 5X7 (no) How much did she plan to spend (no more than $300) Does she need any manual or pro features? (no--automatic/program only) and how much experience does she have with photography (auto everything  point�n�shoot 35mm models) I told her that I would speak with a friend (who sells and distributes photographic equipment) and see what sort of a deal we could find for her. 

When I spoke to my friend, he said, �If she doesn�t mind buying a slightly used camera I have a Canon A20 that was returned because the purchaser didn�t like the program only operation and decided he had to have a three megapixel camera with manual options�.  Since my friend was going to return the A20 to Canon to be refurbished and sold as remanufactured, he was willing to make her a deal.  The camera is about the same size as a compact point �n� shoot 35mm.  The A20�s small silver colored body is stylish and contrasting champagne colored grip gives it an attractive �retro-hip� look.  It was love at first sight when Beth checked the camera out, she thought the A20 looked �cool�.   My friend told her that the camera usually sells for about $300 but that he would let her have it for $250 with a used 32megabyte CF card, a set of 1450 mAh NIMH's and charger (used) and a new Canon SC-PS600 soft case.  Since the A20 ships with an 8Mb CF card and disposable AA�s, Beth jumped at the deal.


The last two megapixel Canon digital camera I used was the Powershot S10, which I really liked, so I was very interested in checking out Canon�s newest model. Beth asked me if I would take her out and show her how to use the camera and then show her how to hook it up to her computer, transfer the photos to her hard drive, etc.  My wife insisted that I help Beth get started since we both know her to be a complete technophobe.  I spent about four hours one recent Saturday giving her the �Introduction to Digital Photography 101� course.  

We spent about an hour at Farnsley Park in the Bon Aire neighborhood where Beth lives.  It was a pretty  Saturday afternoon with good light.  I showed her the basics and then let her try her hand at shooting various images in the park.  She shot playground equipment, a guy walking his dog, some kids riding bikes, and the over-engineered little pedestrian bridge that crosses the small creek that runs through the center of the park.  After she felt confident that she could use the camera effectively outdoors we headed for her apartment and I showed her how to use the camera indoors (flash, white balance, etc) and then how to use the macro mode to shoot close-ups.  She really liked being able to shoot close-ups of her stuff (watch out e-bay, I feel a new account coming on) and take self-timer photos of herself.

Here are my first impressions of the Canon Powershot A20 after a using it (and watching Beth use it) for a couple of hours.

<b>Ergonomics-Handling:</b>  This is a very well designed entry-level digital camera.  It is easy to use and the minimal control array is perfect for novice photographers and snap shooters. All the controls on the A20 (with the exception of the shutter button) are on the rear of the camera.  The camera looks and handles like a small 35mm point and shoot.

<b>LCD:</b> The small LCD is very bright and Beth loved being able to see exactly what her pictures were going to look like before she pressed the shutter button.  She was amazed at having the ability to immediately delete the pictures she didn�t like.  No matter how hard I tried I couldn�t get her to even check out the optical viewfinder.

<b>Shutter lag/cycle times:</b> Better than average, the A20 is very quick in operation, with a good buffer, and excellent start-up and shot-to-shot times 

<b>Power:</b> Battery life is very good with NiMH re-chargeables.  We used the camera (constant LCD use) for more than two hours without triggering the low power warning.  The A20 (and the A10 it�s 1.3 megapixel sibling) are the first Canon digital cameras since 1996 to use AA size batteries, instead of  Canon proprietary battery packs and chargers. This change helps Canon keep the per unit price down and offers consumers the option of buying after market/third party batteries and chargers at a substantial savings over proprietary Canon components. 

<b>Built-in Flash:</b> Auto coverage is pretty good (Canon claims coverage to 13 feet, but I think 10 feet is closer to the truth). Off/Auto/Red-eye reduction modes.

<b>Overall Image Quality:</b> Images are excellent with first rate color balance and great sharpness.  The A20 does tend to meter about 1/3 stop over in outdoor scenes (so it�s a good idea to set the exposure compensation to �0.3) the auto white balance works fine in exterior settings, but doesn�t do well in fluorescent or tungsten lighting, Canon's noise reduction system does a superb job and images are virtually noise free.

<b>White Balance:</b> Auto setting works great outside but white balance presets (indoor and fluorescent) will be needed for accurate colors indoors.  

<b>Lens:</b> The 35-105/f2.8-f4.8 3X zoom is a superb optic with very good resolution and better than average color transmission.  There is no detectable chromatic aberration (purple fringing) or pincushion distortion, but there is minor barrel distortion at the wide-angle end of the zoom range.  Overall an exceptional lens for an entry level digital camera.

<b>Features</b>

The A20 provides several features that are designed to make digital photography easy. Primary color filter and (ASP) adaptive signal processing automatically improve image quality.  The auto exposure sensitivity ISO (equivalent) automatically sets sensitivity based on scene brightness.  Three point AiAF autofocusing is precise and simple. A new (DSP) digital signal processing IC provides high-speed image processing and rapid data transfer with the A20�s USB interface. Direct Print mode (available only if you purchase the Canon CP-10 printer) plus ZoomBrowser EX 2.6 and ImageBrowser 1.6 (SlideShowMaker) and automated set-up of images for e-mail attachments offer �newbie� digital photographers many simple and easy to use imaging options

<b>In the Field/Handling and Operation</b>

My friend and I took an A20 to Cherokee Park and spent about an hour shooting joggers, and mid winter landscapes.  The camera functioned perfectly and delivered consistently excellent results.  We printed one 5X7 (on an Epson Stylus Photo EPX 785) of a particularly cute lady jogger (in pink and red) against a background of dark leafless trees and a cloud filled blue sky.  The resolution. color, contrast, and overall look of the print were easily on par with ISO 200/400 color print film images.  The A20 is so easy to use that purchasers can expect to be shooting images within minutes of opening the box.  

<b>A Few (minor) Concerns</b>

There are no manual settings, no uncompressed image mode, and Beth was disappointed that there was no movie mode.

<b>Conclusion</b>

If you are interested in creative photography then the Canon Powershot A20 probably won�t not meet your needs.  If you are looking for the digital equivalent of a compact 35mm auto everything �point�n�shoot� then this Canon digi-cam is about as good as it is likely to get.  The A20 is a neat little camera that consistently performs like a champ and it should easily best its competition in ease of use and overall performance.  If you're looking for a user friendly entry level 2 megapixel digital camera with a 3X zoom and auto-everything operation, then the A20 should be pretty close to the top of your short list.  Beth �adores� her new digital camera and after spending some quality time with Canon�s newest model, I can recommend it without reservation.  Canon got it right with this one.
