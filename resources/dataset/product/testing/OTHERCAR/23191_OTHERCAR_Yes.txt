            I enjoy driving the Honda Accord station wagon.  It is one of the few station wagons left that are roomy in the passenger area and the storage area.  Further, I enjoy the cruise control options which include and increase and decrease in speed buttons.  This car handles very well, and I have driven both the Accord station wagon and the Accord LX.  I noticed very little difference between the way these two cars handle, so anyone who has an Accord and is looking to buy something with more room, this is a great choice.  This car also has great heat and AC.  <br><br>
