            I purchased my Honda Accord while in college and have enjoyed for over 9 years.  I purchased for its great reputation and business type looks.  While purchasing the vehicle, I also was pleased with the salesman at the dealership and the ability to negotiate the price down from the list price.  I bought the vehicle in Denver, Co and the list price was $19,000. I negotiated it down to $16,000 with a $500 trade in.

I cannot say enough good things about my car.  I keep up all recommended maintenance on my car with the dealership, which I know costs a little more but I believe it saved me in the long run.  I have had few problems with my car and I have put 199,000 miles on it.  One problem that I had at the beginning was with the cassette deck until about 65,000 miles.  It was replaced 3 times but the dealership replaced it for free all three times even though the warranty was up at 50,000 miles.  I also had to have the light lever replaced at 180,000 miles but cost a few $100 dollars.  Other than that I have had no problems with this car.  I feel that the service at the dealerships are outstanding and fair.  They do not try to stick with extra costs or additions and always call you if there is an additional repair or replacement other than mileage recommended service before continuing with your car.  Also, they give a ride to work if needed and will arrange to drop your car off at your work when completed at no extra cost.

I recommend Honda to all my friends.  <br><br>
