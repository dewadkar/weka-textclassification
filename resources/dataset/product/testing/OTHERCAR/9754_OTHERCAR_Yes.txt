            I bought this camera after my Nikon Coolpix 800 was stolen.  I loved the 800, but I wasn't able to replace it with the exact same model.  It came down to either the 880 or the 2500.

The reason I decided to buy the 2500 is pretty much its portability.  I have an 18-month-old son, and I love to bring the camera with me wherever I go, but I don't like to carry a big diaper bag, so the camera needs to be small.  Of course, I also wanted the camera to have good resolution for emailing and printing photos, and a decent digital zoom.

The Nikon 2500 has exceeded all of my expectations.  It's small and light and easy to throw into the diaper bag.  The quality of the pictures is quite good, and the menus are very easy to use.  I liked the Coolpix 800, but the menu system was just too complicated for someone who just wants to snap pictures of her kid doing something adorable.  The 2500's portrait settings are shown as icons, so there's no guessing which setting to use.  The menus are very easy to use as well, which makes for smooth and quick shots that turn out just the way I want them to.  It took me a little while to get used to not having an optical viewfinder, but the digital one works really well in most situations.  The one exception is when you're trying to shoot a picture in very bright sun -- the image in the digital viewfinder can be hard to see.  

Before buying this product, I read reviews that claimed that the 2500 has a red-eye problem because the flash is so close to the lens.  I have not found this to be true, in fact, I see less red-eye now than I did with the 800.  

The 2500 comes with an 8-mb starter card (for storing the pictures on).  I upgraded to a 64-mb card, which is great.  I can't imagine running out of space on a card that big!  The battery is very small, but it seems to work for several hours of use between charges.  I strongly recommend getting a spare battery as back-up, though.  The camera also comes with a cable to plug directly into the PC, but since I have a card reader, I haven't used that at all yet.  I also have not used the Nikon photo software, because I'm pretty much used to using to Paint Shop Pro for my digital photo needs.
