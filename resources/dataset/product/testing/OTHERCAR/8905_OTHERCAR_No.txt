            Looking for a great car that won't let you down? Well the Z3 Roadster is one of the best cars that you can ever buy.  I recently bought a this car for 40 g's and I haven't regreted it yet. there is a great amount of power in this car and you can really feel it when the car starts up and you reve the engine. it has a great purr to the engine. The cost is well worth it. With out the Roadster, I don't know what I would do! It handles great on the roads and cornering is a breeze with the Z3. So if you are looking for a great reliable car, put the one of a kind Z3 Roadster on your test drive list.<br><br>
