            I bought this vehicle in 1995 because it was in my price range and I was rebuilding my credit.  My payments were nice and low and I did not spend an extraordinary amount of money in repairs and maintenance.  The car was used when I purchased it but still under manufacturer's warranty.  The car drives nicely, I also made sure I had new tires on the car and always kept up with shocks and front end wheel alignments, oil changes, etc.

Well, now my 1993 is five years older than when I purchase it (seven years total) and I have just passed the car on to my 17 year old and she loves the car.  It still rides very well and looks good.  The interior and exterior are still in excellent condition and has held up very well with 3 teenagers and various others.

We took a lot of road trips in this car and we were always comfortable.  It has an excellent stereo system, I added a CD player and my daughter now loves it.

I recommend this vehicle particularly for new drivers and folks that don't want to spend lots of money in insurance and maintenance.  For me it was a winner.
