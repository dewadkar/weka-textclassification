            I bought this truck to replace a 1994 Nissan 2WD pickup that I bought new
and had mass problems with like 3 motors in 11,000 miles but that's another story. I needed something that could transport my racing motorcycle to the track that wasn't too expensive to buy, operate, or insure and the Tacoma delivers. It drives comparably to cars in it's price
range but with much more power and a little less gas mileage. The only problem I've had with it was a chirping cooling fan clutch which the dealer had fixed in 45 minutes under warrantee. I now have 46,000 miles with no other problems. I've found that the original tires are good for
about 45,000 miles but upgrading to better tires does make a very noticeable improvement. I went with Pirelli P400 Touring tires with no complaints. Another worthwhile improvement was a K&amp;N air filter that made a modest difference in power and gas mileage. The only downside I've encountered is that 2 wheel drive pickups are not too great in the snow so
investing in the best state of the art snow tires is almost mandatory if
you live in the snow belt also extra weight in the back helps a lot too.
All my life I've had a remarkable talent for buying new or used lemons and this is the first reliable vehicle I've owned since 1969! You'll have to pry my cold dead fingers from around it to get it!!!!
