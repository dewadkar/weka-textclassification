            I came to this very site to check out epinions on the PT Cruiser when my wife and I were considering buying one.  I read all the stuff about it being under powered and about it really being a Neon in sheeps clothing.

Then we went and bought one!  

Now, we did test drive it first, and found the power issue to really be a non-issue.  Perhaps this is because we've been driving the same Honda Civic for 11 years, and it doesn't have much get-up-and-go left, but the power of the Cruiser seemed just fine, even on the automatic we tested.  I mean, how fast do we need to go?  I think the power issue is a macho-young-guy thing that has been picked up and rehashed by too many people.  Also, I think that the Cruiser was so good that people were looking for ANYTHING negative they could say.

In our case, we did, however, order a manual transmission, and I'm sure it gives us more of a sense of power, since we can leave it in lower gears a little longer than the computer does on the automatic.  And hey, with a car this cool looking, you gotta have a nifty little shifter!

We love the car.  We smile when we see it.  I bath it regularly.  Pamper it.  And despite what you may be thinking -- No, it is not a surrogate child :-)

I haven't had this much fun with a car since I owned a
Triumph TR4a!

Are there caveats?  Sure.  It's a little sloppy in the corners.  Rolls a bit too much for my liking.  But this may be a hard thing to compensate for in a vehicle that is built so high.  I'm no expert, but I keep thinking a stiffer antiroll bar might help.  However, remember that we've been driving a little Honda -- and they practically handle like sports cars -- so the Cruiser being a bit soft is not a big deal, and not unexpected..

The gas mileage is a bit disappointing, as well.  On the highway, it does well.  On our initial "let's try it out" roadtrip it averaged 34 mpg.  Not bad.  Around town, it isn't doing too well, though we haven't quantified it yet.  Suffice to say that we notice that we're filling up a lot more often than we did with the Honda.  On the other hand, I'm guessing that those of you with pickups and SUVs have long ago given up on the gas mileage wars....

And I wish the seats fit me better.  It's a minor thing (and I have some back problems, so I might be overly critical) but I wish the lumbar support hit me in the right spot.

WITH THAT SAID.....The car is a blast.  It is fun to drive, fun to look at and the fit and finish was really great.  I am near 50 and have never owned an American car -- but this one won me over....and I've loving it!
