            In November 1997, only five months after my high school graduation I got into a<i> very minor, not my fault,</i> car accident with my 1984 CRX my parents had gotten me for graduation (I'd hate to see what would have happened if it was major). The accident totaled my car, which I did love very much (it was a FUN car to own :), but that isn't the subject).  Well, the next month after I got the money from my totaled car &lt;sniff&gt;, my Father, my boyfriend (now husband), and I went car shopping FOR HOURS!

Every car we looked at was a junker it seemed, at least the ones we test drove and we looked at a lot of cars!  This just shows how idiotic I was, I was looking for another CRX to own at first but when that didn't seem possible I was just looking for a Honda.

I only had one day to do the car shopping and I felt pressured for time, it was getting close to the time of closing for most dealerships and we hadn't found a car yet.  The last place we went was where we found the 1990 Chevy Lumina Euro.  At first I wasn't too impressed with the car but it was the only decent looking car they had in the price range I was looking for (could afford).

Honestly the first thing I noticed and liked about this car was the steering wheel.  Don't ask why LOL, I just thought it looked neat.

<i>Taking the car out for the test drive</i> I thought it was going to be too much car for me, after having such a little car, but I found it to be very easy to handle through traffic (and on a windy country road, but this was after I got the car).  Also with it having power steering helped a lot too.  :)  I didn't really have many complaints after driving the car.

<b> What I like about the Lumina</b>
* Power Steering
* Cruise control
* Power Windows
* Power Locks
* Child safety locks
* Four doors
* Smooth Driving (nice shocks)
* Huge trunk space
* 3.1 liter engine (V6 if I'm not mistaken)

<b> What I dislike about the Lumina</b>
* Mileage isn't too great compared to other cars
* Non-electric adjustable seats
* It's an automatic (after I learned how to drive a stick shift I don't care much for automatics)
* &quot;Dummy lights&quot; instead of real gauges (Lights up when there is a problem, I prefer gauges)

Now that I have a family I am very pleased that I purchased this car.  It is an excellent family car due to the four doors and excellent trunk space.  

The Chevy Lumina has proven to be durable, I have had it since December 1997 and I have not had to put much money into it besides the obvious oil changes and a tune up.  It did have 80,000 miles on it too.  Of course it helped that the owners before me took great care of it too. *<i>Remember to always get the car looked at by a mechanic before purchasing.</i>*

I think that when I am ready to go looking for another car I will definitely keep the Chevy Lumina in mind (along with other Chevy cars).  It has proven to me to be a wonderful dependable car.  I would recommend this car for anyone who has a family and is looking for an inexpensive dependable vehicle.<br><br>
