              I would like to share my love of the Chevy Blazer! I would have to agree with others that it is not a truck, it's a &quot;BLAZER!&quot;
  I purchased my Blazer not too many months ago and it has been absolutely wonderful! The color, comfort, tow-package, sporty 2dr, hunter green beauty has treated me well!
  I would have thought the mpg would kill me with the gas prices skyrocketing, but I have been pleased! It costs a pretty penny to fill it up, but the mpg has been outstanding! And I look good in it too! From the city to the country heads turn! And I thought they were looking at me!
  For a wife and mother of two with a big dog, I can say that my blazer has accommodated us all very well on trips! Roomy with extra outlets for a vcr,tv,radar detector and still pull on the battery and alternator with no trouble at all! 
  I would recommend all power! To include the driver's seat! And I love the little extras...personal sunglass compartment, cd compartment, and garage door opener compartment (even if you don't have one!). The stereo (factory) is pretty good (great bass!) with different sound settings for types of music!
  It is like a candy store! I cannot believe I waited sooo long for one! I don't even want to upgrade, I am so happy with the one I have!
  I wouldn't advise towing over 3000 pounds through the mountains! It is heck on the gas then! But, it made it! Over 1800 miles and still purred like a kitten. And that is unusual for a standard transmission!
  I would encourage all to try one, you might be surprised! :)
  And let us say...Chevy, Chevy, Chevy......
