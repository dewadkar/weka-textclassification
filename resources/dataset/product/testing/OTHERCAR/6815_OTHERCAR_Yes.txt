            After wrecking our van the dealership loaned us a 1998 Mercury Sable to drive until we purchase a new van.  This car is a pleasure to drive.  The 3.0 liter engine is very snappy and responds quickly.

Our pre-teen son loves the sound system.  It came with an AM/FM Cassette and six disc CD changer.  There are six speakers that sound great.  I am impressed with the fact that the controls are so easy to access from the drivers seat.

You can fold down either side of the back seat to access the trunk.   I thought this was so handy, especially for storing coats and purses on long trips.  

The car seats five comfortably.  There is also a shoulder harness for a third person in the back seat.  Even though there is a seat belt for a third person in the front I think it would be too crowded for the driver to have someone sit there.  My husband doesn't really think that the passenger side seat offered enough leg room, but I don't have any problems and I am by no means a small person.
						
Overall, I think the Mercury Sable is stylish, comfortable, and handles very well.  If we didn't need the extra room a van offers I would seriously consider purchasing it.
