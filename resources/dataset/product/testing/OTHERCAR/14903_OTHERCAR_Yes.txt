            I use the FD-71 for high resolution photos at work to image leg ulcers.  The acuity of the camera is great and its easy to use.  The detail on the pictures is also very good.  Color quality is realistic.  When I use standard size photos there is just a rare hint that the photo is digital if you are skilled at looking.  When the photo is expanded to 8x10, there is no question that the photo was taken by a digital and not a classic camera.  I don't think anyone would be less than satisfied with this product and I like it.  If your a perfectionist you'll need to get more resolution.  <br><br>
