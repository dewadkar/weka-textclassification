             In May of 1995 I purchased a 1992 Pontiac Grand Prix (GTP) from a local Kansas City metropolitan car dealership. . This particular automobile was designated a GTP (P being a designate for package ) and had been made to a customers specifications to include such high tech gadgetry as a HUD (Heads Up Display ), Stereo controls inset on the steering wheel, and an onboard computer display ( showing a compass, thermometer, gas consumption, and travel distance indicator).
Not to mention the cosmetic features as well, including front &amp; rear spoiler, fog lights, and a vented hood.
This car was bright red and I thought it was &quot; the bomb &quot;; little did I know that it would turn out to be exactly that.
Several weeks after taking possession of the car, the custom chrome mag wheels turned a nasty rust color (evidently from the brake pads continually wearing out ). This defect kept us returning to the shop on a continual basis ( we later learned that most Pontiac's have a defect with their rear brake apertures). Many of the gizmos on the car also began to wear out within six months time of owning the car. The HUD continually lit up almost blinding you at night, the cup holders wouldn't retract, and even the cigarette lighter refused to ignite.
Now granted this car was a used automobile but hey, it wasn't even five years old at the time of purchase.
Then to top it off, during one of the winter months here the car locked my wife inside and forced entry had to be made to extract her from within.
The windows were electric and since the car had died would not roll down, not to mention that the electric door locks were no longer operational and although manually unlocking the doors; they remained locked &amp; shut.
The car was a nice eye catcher, for local mechanics of our area I'm sure!
If you have a wish to spend your entire life savings on automobile repairs, then I would have to say Pontiac is for you.
But as for me, I wont ever have an inclination to even look at one again!
