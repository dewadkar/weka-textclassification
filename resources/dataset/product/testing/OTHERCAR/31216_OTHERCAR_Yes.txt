            Replacing the old Cherokee, the new Jeep Liberty is without any doubt one of the best vehicles in it's class today. In a few words, here are my impressions of the Liberty, after having owned it for over 6 months.


Thumbs up:

-Looks & Personality: Even if it has been on the market for over a year, the new Liberty still makes heads turn everywhere we go. The design is almost perfect, and from any angle of view the Liberty stands out when compared to other SUV's in it's class.
-Rigid platform: In the six months that we owned the Jeep, we have not once heard a squeek in the cabin. Even when in difficult road conditions, the chassis seems extremely strong (Unlike the Japanese SUV's we had tested).
-Comfortable ergonomics: During our longer trips, my family and I have never had to complain about seat comfort, storage space, or cabin volume. Although not quite as roomy than some minivans, the Liberty is big enough for 4 average-size adults.
-Strong V6 engine: Torque is important on a 4X4. Best in it's class with 235Lbs of torque, this 3.7L V6 is more than strong enough for most purposes. Jeep allows owners to attach trailers up to 5000Lbs to there Liberty, provided they are properly equiped for the task. In city traffic or on the highway, the engine never seems to be down on power. In comparaison, Mazda's Tribute has 200Lbs, Ford's Escape has 196Lbs, Honda's new 2002 CRV has 162Lbs of torque, Toyota's new RAV4 is far behind with 142Lbs, and Hyundai's Santa Fe has 177Lbs (although it is less than this since - as we now know as a fact - Hyundai has a tendency to overinflate it's power figures). 
-Excellent commuter: Because of it's relativily compact length, the Liberty is easy to drive through traffic, and also to park in tight spaces. By the way, this 4X4 can turn on a dime!
-Fit & Finish: Excellent paint quality, rigid body panels, choice of materials inside the cabin. All of these factors contribute to the above average fit & finish of the Liberty.
-4X4 advantages: Very easy to use, the Liberty's 4X4 Select Track functions (optionnal) have numerous advantages over 2X4 vehicules (namely: TRACTION), and also over other 4X4's in this class. In one word: Instead of letting the truck decide which is best for you (like on other models in this class), YOU HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL. During winter season, driving the Liberty in snow or slush provides pure pleasure!


Thumbs down:

-Gas consumption: if it weren't for it's high gas consumption, this SUV would be without any major down sides. On the other hand, in order to achieve 235Lbs of torque, some sacrifices must be made. In my opinion, the 3.5L engine that Acura put into the MDX is THE BEST in it's class because of the achieved 245Lbs of torque with a smaller displacement engine (3.5L rather that 3.7) and a 20% lower gas consumption. Viva el V-Tech!!! Only problem with the MDX is the price tag...
-Cramped leg room for 4 tall adults: heads, elbows and shoulders will never have to complain in the Liberty. But legs are a tad on the cramped size when 4 taller adults (6 feet and up) are fitted inside. Jeep should have installed a ajustable rear seat instead of a fixed one.
-Vehicle height imposes slow down in curves: In normal driving conditions, this should never be a problem, but some U.S. magazines have reported a potential recall for the Liberty. The safety Nazis in the States are pushing Chrysler to reduce the height of the vehicle by a fair amount due to rollover accident potential. Chrysler 
has already lowered the suspension on remaining 2002 models still being built due to media attention . Some magazine test actually provoked a rollover. Some controversee about single vehicle SUV rollover accidents has been around for a while but it looks like Chrysler might make good on it the ones alreadly sold also.
