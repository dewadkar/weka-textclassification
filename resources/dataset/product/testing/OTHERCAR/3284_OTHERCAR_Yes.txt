                 I'm going to start with the looks of the car, because well obviously that's gonna be the first thing that you'll see. Sharing it's chassis, engine and powertrain, and many other parts with the nearly-identical Mitsubishi Eclipse, Eagle nonetheless gave it a few tweaks that differentiate the pair, such as a slightly different nose and grille, different styles of spoilers for each, and rear bumpers among other things. 

    The Talon is sporty in every sense of its exterior. With its curvy, muscular body, short overhangs, low stance, and the open "mouth" of the grille all convey a sense of sporting ability and eagerness to do...well, whatever. The wheels that came on mine could really be better; they're 
merely a plastic-looking hubcap with a rather uninspired design on 14-inch wheels. I understand that this is the base ESi, but you would expect that this car would have  better wheels to match the great-looking body. 

    All that aside, let's move to the interior. For being such a low car, the drop down into the seat isn't too bad, I think. Once there, you sit in a comfy tan cloth seat that's bolstered in all the right places so that you 
won't be sliding around should you engage in any type of performance maneuvers. There's also a nice little grab handle above the window on the passenger side should you decide to put the car through some of its paces with someone else. 

    The cockpit feels kind of narrow, but comfortable for you and a friend and maybe a child or someone else short of stature in the back. This is a driver-oriented car, as the dash actually comes out and toward the driver so that everything is there when you need it. The dashpod houses all of the necessary gauges (including a speedometer that goes all the way to 160mph--is that possible?) all marked clearly and legibly. One major design flaw that I've noticed is the awkward placement for the stereo. It sets 
right in front of the 5-speed, so that while driving, it's hard, if not next to impossible, to see it completely and have total access to everything because of it's, and the transmission's placement (a design fault it's sister-car the Eclipse also has). And don't even think about trying to put a CD in while in first, third, or fifth gears. While I'm on cons, the rear seat is essentially useless as far as carrying people is concerned, save for small kids. Which is ok by me, it makes it a cozier environment for two. 
Just a heads up if you're thinking about one and have kids. 

    The engine standard in the ESi is a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder that's also present in the RS and GS (excepting the GST and GSX) trim in the Eclipse. This engine makes 140 horsepower @ 6000 rpm and 133 lb-ft of torque @ 4800 
rpm. I find this a delightful engine, because I think it's well balanced. It has alot of it's torque down low, so it doesn't need to be revved stratospherically to get menial amounts of power. It also produces a nice engine note, kind of growly when you get on it, and when you're not, it 
provides the power more quietly in a smooth and linear manner. Being a four-cylinder it also gets pretty good gas mileage, with about 22mpg in the city, and 32 on the highway with the 5-speed. There's another engine package 
available with a TSi or TSi AWD. This is a 2.0-liter as well, but it makes 210 horses at 6000 rpm and 214 lb-ft of torque @ 3000 rpm instead. The power difference is achieved by use of a turbo. The TSi package gives the Talon a little more aesthetic panache with lower profile alloy wheels, a bigger spoiler, and a bit bigger grille, just to name a few exterior differences. The all-wheel-drive is only available with the TSi package, by the way.

     Overall, this is a great car with so many pluses and few minuses. The sporty looks, the good ride and quiet interior, the traffic-friendly size, and the fabulous engine that can get you out of tight spots and iffy situations relatively quickly (manually equipped, as I've found that the base 2.0-liter and the 4-speed automatic to be a sluggish combination) all combine to make a great car that's good for general transportation that looks good and can put a smile on your face.
 
     This car also comes recommended by MSN's auto feature, scoring a 5 out of 5 in reliability, and only minimal problems reported (except one moderate problem dealing with the timing belt on the 2.0-liter turbo engine). And for safety, even the base ESi comes standard with driver and passenger airbags. For more information, I must recommend the 'Autos' section of www.msn.com .
