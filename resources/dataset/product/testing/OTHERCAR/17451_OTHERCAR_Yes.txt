            Honda's newest generation Prelude...  this masterpiece became my dream car at the age of 17 when it was first released to the market.  Finally, at the age of 23, I was able to afford one.  My initial impressions were high.  The car is very fast and has an unequaled responsiveness.  The engine set up is similar to the Integra GS-R's, however the secondary intake path opens up a bit sooner, at 5000 rpm.  This yields an immense burst of power and a very cool engine noise.  The rigid frame structure combined with the stock 16" wheels allows for hairpin turns and rapid lane changes.  The vehicle's performance in all categories is definitely its strong point.

My Prelude is Nighthawk black with the standard black cloth interior.  The paint is very glossy and of Honda's known quality.  The exterior of the Prelude speaks for itself: very sporty, semi-aggressive styling with a touch of expensive class.  I really like the look of the seats, however the interior has a sort of cheap feel to it, like a Civic.  Honda should have offered leather for the new Prelude, but I suppose in order to keep costs down, the cloth is ok.  The gauge cluster is simple and compact, much different from the previous Preludes, which had gauges spread across the entire dash of the car.  I painted my gauge bezels chrome to make it look a little my expensive, BMW style.

Problems, Problems, Problems....  mostly little things.  I purchased the car from a used dealer with 89K on it.  Actually, I traded my 1996 Audi A4 with 56K on it, and I had to kick in $700.  The Prelude was marked at $10,500.  The Audi was super nice, I only paid $8000 for it, so it felt good to essentially get the Prelude for $8700.  Anyway, within a week I found many small things wrong with the Prelude.  First, one headlight was out, a quick and easy fix.  Second, a very leaky trunk.  I had to replace the foam seals on the taillights, as water was coming in through these.  I also had to seal a section of the trunk liner with silicon, as it was separated and leaking water.  This seemed strange as the car is only 6 years old.  Third, the sunroof locked up the first time I opened it.  I checked the track and it was bone dry... a little grease did the trick.  Fourth, the headliner over the back seats had a squeaky rattle.  This is apparently a common problem with the 97's.  Fifth, once locked, the passenger door wouldn&#146t unlock by either the power lock switches or manually, only with the key after many tries.  I had to rip apart the door and study the locking mechanism for an hour through a tiny hole.  Turns out that a certain lever which needs to fall after using the outer door handle, wasn&#146t falling back into place properly.  I had to buy a 2 inch spring at Lowes and put it in my door to correct this.  The car also had never been serviced, so I broke for the $650 jobber &#150 timing belt, water pump, both drive belts and a NOX sensor.  I attribute most of these flaws to the previous two owners, who apparently didn&#146t have the car serviced very often, other than regular oil changes.  Also, the first year of production for the new Prelude might have a little to do with it.

Overall, I am very happy with the Prelude.  It has awesome style and you can't go wrong with nearly 200 horse power in such a tight, sporty vehicle.  This is by far the highest performing car I have owned.  It has relatively low interior noise on the highway, but the stereo could be a bit more beefy.  Back seat is really only good for items, or maybe you could lay across it... uncomfortably.  Also, the location of the E-Brake lever is questionable (passenger side of the center console).  Bottom line is if you want style, speed, and power with Honda engine reliability, the 5th Gen. Prelude is for you!!
