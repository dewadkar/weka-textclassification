            I recently bought a 1997 Honda Prelude and I feel that it is a great car. It took me awhile to decide what type of car I would want to purchase. I wanted either the new Accord, Celica, or Prelude. The Accord was the cheaper out of those three car but I decide on the Prelude because once I test drive the car I knew it was for me. Also, I saw alot of nice body kit for the new Prelude. The Prelude drive really smooth where I don't realize I am driving at a high speed sometime. This car doesn't eat lot of gas. I get pretty good gas mileage on this car. I usually spend about $14 a week on gas. I suggest that if anyone out who is looking for a car they should go test drive the Prelude.<br><br>
