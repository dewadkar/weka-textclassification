            I won't cover the car's stats and record in this space, since I'm not an automotive expert and there are great sites with comprehensive info. I'm just going to tell you how I like my 10-month old V40.

I was deciding between a VW Passat wagon and an Audi A4 in addition to this and my decision was probably made by the safety and reliability of Volvo. 

The first thing that strikes you is how little it looks like a Volvo. Really, only the front grille tips you off at first. Boxy it ain't. Really, it looks terrific. In fact, it's featured in the IKEA catalog hauling a houseful of put-together furniture.

The car maneuvers with very little effort and is easier to park than a full-sized wagon. The turning radius seems very small to me, though I don't know what the stat is. Sometimes, however, the power steering turns the care unexpectedly fast.

I have noticed that sometimes the brake pedal is a little hesitant -- if I am making a sudden stop i have to press a little further down than I initially expect. But in normal conditions the car responds to a very slight touch.

The interesting thing is the car's size. At 3000 pounds it's what could only be called a compact wagon. When the big snowstorm hit Chicago in December (18 inches in 2 days) the car got briefly stuck in our (unplowed) alley and my husband had to come out and push. This was in over 6 inches of snow, and only an SUV could have done better, I think. But overall the car has handled the snow, slush, etc. beautifully, and without snow tires or recourse to the traction control and "Winter/wet" mode.

The size is a compromise between a sedan and a wagon. It feels like a sedan with a hatchback instead of a trunk. There is considerably more cargo space than any sedan although you don't get the lavish space of a "real" wagon. The brochure shows a bike being transported in the bay (with the back seats down) and my husband and I have actually done this quite successfully.

The front is very roomy for the legs, but the positioning of the middle armrest makes getting the seatbelt annoying. 
I am sure the back seat is more cramped but I have never sat there. Also, there is an odd visibility problem when looking back over the left shoulder, to check the blind spot. I have learned to compensate for it, but it's a definate annoyance.

To sum up the size, think of a Jetta as a wagon, or a golf gaining a little more cargo space. For my family, it's an ideal size -- the handling and parkability of a sedan, but with some of the convenience and cargo space of a wagon.

The seats are extremely comfortable, although a power seat adjuster would be a nice addition.
