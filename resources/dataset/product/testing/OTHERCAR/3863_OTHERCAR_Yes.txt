            Bought this used 6 months ago for towing.  put 6k miles on it in these 6 months without using it for commuting!

Decent handling for a truck--though not a sports car, not a bad ride, and it can get out of its way without rolling over.  Actually, I've followed a buddy in his '96 Tahoe (essentially identical) down twisty roads...in capable hands, these things will surprise you.  Good performance--the Chevy 350 has come a long way in this, its latest (last) iteration (the Vortec 5700).

This was to be our extra car...if this is any indicator, my wife keeps "borrowing" it over her Volvo wagon. hmmm... Tows 6000# without problem, good road trip car.

Downsides:  Fuel economy:  16 mpg fwy (70+mph), 13 mpg town, 11mpg towing 5000# (1600 miles).  Brakes are OK--I'd like them to be more effective (they stop fine, but I've also been driving a much smaller car for the last 20 yrs)
Defect?  the Vortec 5700 (from '96-'99) has a intake manifold gasket that leaks after about 50-70k miles.  Gasket replacement is the only solution--$20 part, 4 hours effort.  There is speculation these leaks are the result of overtightening of the intake manifold bolts during engine assembly.  If you buy one, find out if the gasket has been replaced
