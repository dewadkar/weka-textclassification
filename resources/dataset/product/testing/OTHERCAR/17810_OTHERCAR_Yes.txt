            When I first saw this inexpensive little camera I thought it couldn't take very good photographs but to my surprise it did. 
Not only did it take nice photos but it was very easy to use! 
You can change it from 640 x480 pixels to 320 x 240 pixels. 
You can set it on flash or no flash. 
And you can easily delete all or some of the images.

I have a professional digital camera that I love but I don't always want to take the time to get it ready to use, also in Florida we have lots of wet weather that I don't want it to be in. My Casio LV-10 is so small that I can take it anywhere and put it in my pocket if it starts to rain. 

I do a lot of once in a lifetime photos (my friends and I are daredevils) from sky diving to playing with the wild animals at my friend's outpost and it never lets me down. 

When I changed the batteries none of the photos I had already taken got lost. That was great!

The LV-10 viewer is easy to use. I just wish I could it on my iMac but for the money it is great!!!
