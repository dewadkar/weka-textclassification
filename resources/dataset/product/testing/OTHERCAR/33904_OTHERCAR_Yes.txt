                 My little truck (1990 2WD) has been a savior for the most part.  It has never left me stranded anywhere..... I have 180,000 miles on it, about 75,000 of that were local delivery miles (a lot of starting and stopping).  I am just now starting to pay the price of using your vehicle for deliveries...  The furniture I was hauling finally took it's toll on the shocks, which is to be expected.  My biggest problem, and really my only complaint, is the drive line. It has a staked u-joint system, meaning I can't replace the u-joints without having to replace the entire driveshaft and yolk.  I can't really comprehend the logic behind this, other than the fact that they are making autos less and less &quot;home-mechanic friendly&quot; every year.  So now I'm trying to find a used drive line for it, being that it is 10 years old, and I'm ready to graduate to a full size truck now.  The standard cab is designed more for a small or medium sized person, not recommended for anyone over 6' tall.  Along with many other owners, I have also started experiencing the diminishing clear coat problem on top of the cab.  All and all, my little Nissan has been a great vehicle, with just routine maintenance and very minor fix-its on it's agenda.  I would HIGHLY recommend this vehicle, especially as a starter and/or light duty worker.  I hope you have as many enjoyable years as I have.        -D-<br><br>
