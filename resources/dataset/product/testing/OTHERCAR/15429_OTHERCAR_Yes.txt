            I've had my GTI since Feb. 99, brand spanking new.  One of the hardest to find colors &quot;Tropic Orange&quot;, I 'm told it's a very limited color, like many other of the colors this year, which is one of the reasons why I like VW's so much.  Everyone isn't driving around in one exactly like mine. 

The last car I owned was a 95 Jetta and it was time to trade it in when I saw the new style GTI's, fell in love with it on the spot.  The car runs excellent, on the highway or around town.  I like it much better than the old Jetta, it has so much more power, not sluggish like my Jetta was.  I only have the 4 cylinder and I'm quite happy with it.  The car actually has quite a bit of room and a good sized trunk for a sporty car.  It's definitely very comfortable and does pretty good on gas.  I have no complaints on how this car drives.

One thing I've had repeated problems with the sunroof which no one could quite figure out why.  First the sunroof track broke and needed to be replaced.  It couldn't even close all the way, then problems with the sensors.  They have a sensor in them to stop it from closing on someone or something and mine was not working. After about 7 visits and many parts replace it was finally fixed.  Also they have a &quot;sport&quot; shifter which has a small rim of silver on it which after less than 3 month started peeling off and actually cutting my hand.  Of course they replaced that right away for me but it's starting to peel again only a couple of months later.

Overall I would still recommend this car to anyone who asks.  Other than the couple things I just wrote about the car is the best car I've ever owned.  I guess they all can't be perfect...<br><br>
