            I trust Toyota. I owned another brand new compact Toyota before and this one is just as good, if not better. It gets wonderful gas mileage and does everything I need or want it to do, which is to get me to work and saving me money. Working about 40 miles round trip from home was just about killing me with my old buick. I dreaded the old gas pumps...yikes! But now it's actually almost...I said &quot;almost&quot; lol a pleasure to hand over around 12 bucks for a fill that will last me the entire week!

Needless to say, it is a compact car, so for all you people who hate road noise...don't buy one! As for the dash being off center, it isn't much different than looking at one in front of you. I was pondering what someone said about the danger, and while I was in mine the other day glanced down to see what they might be talking about. There isn't any. If the dash was in front of me, I would still be glancing off the road, but it's to the right of me...(and not that far, remember it's a small car) and so instead of glancing down with my eyes, I just glance to the right. Don't even have to turn my head.

The room is wonderful, head or otherwise. It has oodles of power for a small car, and I love it!!<br><br>
