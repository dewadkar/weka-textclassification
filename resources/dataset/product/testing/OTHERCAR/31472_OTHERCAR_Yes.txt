            I bought this car in '96 while still in college and it is one of the best first cars for a college student on a tight budget. The purchase price was very affordable and the fuel usage is good for a car of that type (23 mi/gal highway, 18-19 city). At 80mph the ride is very soft and comfortable. It has a nice sporty appearance and attractive, roomy interior. The large trunk is great for long road trips. 
Disadvantages are the chips of paint peeling off the hood and doors, a small leak in the coolant container outlet and a moody parking brake. A mechanic informed me that the last two are problems peculiar to this model. They are not critical, though annoying, and cost about $400 total to fix.
