            WOW!  Just got a chance to spend one week and one thousand miles in a Dodge Neon with 3,000 miles on it.  The first time I was in one of these buckets of bolts, I was sorely disappointed with ride, refinement and noise/vibration/harshness issues.  Well, the body redo in 2000 which carries over to the 2001 MY erases a lot of my concerns.  Anecdotal evidence from a friend who owns one warned me about the poor fuel economy so I kept my eye on this.  The results are summarized below:

Great:
1)  Price/value.
2)  Interior roominess, fit, refinement.
3)  Nice exterior styling (remember: this is the economy class).
4)  Ride and handling.  Smoother and quieter than a Corolla (bought my Mom one of those) and the Ford Escort, even under acceleration and high speed (80MPH+) cruising.
5)  Cruise control is excellent.

Good:
1)  Fuel economy (I got 30-31 MPG in mostly highway driving, a Ford Escort under similar circumstances got about 41, and my Camry gets about 33 MPG!).
2)  Low-end torque (good acceleration, even from 55 - 65 MPH).
3)  Stereo system.

Fair:
1)  Resale for Dodge cars has been questionable.
2)  Lots of glass makes for a spacious interior but all that glass soaks up a LOT of heat due to the greenhouse effect.

Improvement needed:
1)  Questionable options packages (e.g., one pkg lets you get power FRONT windows and hand crank rear windows??).  This sure is.....different - but you might like it.  This is obviously NOT for parents with small kids because you will not be able to lock out the rear windows as you could if they were all power.
2)  The option package had the dome light switch on the light stalk which made it accessible only to the diver.  Might be inconvenient for right seat navigators.

Conclusion:
This is a excellent vehicle given its mission in life.  No pocket rocket, but then again you won't need a NASA budget to own or operate this greatly improved compact car either.
