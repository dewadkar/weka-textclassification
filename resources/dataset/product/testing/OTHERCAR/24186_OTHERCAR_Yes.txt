            I purchased a DSC-S30 from Sears before my family took a trip to Disney World.  I had been contemplating a digital camera purchase for a few years, and watched as my friends and family bought everything from Visor Eyemodules to Olympus Digital cameras.  I was by and large unimpressed with the whole digital camera market but foresaw myself thumbing through stacks of photo prints from the Magic Kingdom (at about 20 cents a print, I guess) and I knew it was time to step into a digital camera.

I'm not a Sears shopper.  In fact, I typically only go there to pay my Discover bill when I'm running behind, which was the case on this fateful day when I saw the Sony line of cameras.  My interest faded quickly upon seeing the $599 price of the DSC-S30.  The salesman brought me a brand new returned DSC-S30 and I immediately bought it for $350.

I was thoroughly impressed with the size of the camera, which adequately fit into my pocket.  

The resolution, 1.3 megapixels, wasn't the highest around, but was more than enough for family photos and the like.  I also appreciated the multiple size and format options for the photos you take.   

The two most impressive features were the flip-screen lcd display--which protects the screen during storage and travel (heck, it looks and sounds cool, too)--and the SmartMedia memory chip.  After taking photos, just plug the camera into your usb port and view the memory chip as a 'removeable hard drive' on your PC.  

The camera comes drivers and software for basic photo editing, which is nice but in my case unnecessary.  Oh, and it doesn't work on Windows NT because of the USB requirement.

I was a bit disappointed in the 4 Meg chip that came with the camera.  This held about 15 large (1200 pixel) images if I remember correctly.  I soon stepped up to 32 meg chip and held around 350 smaller (640x480) images.  Yes, this SmartMedia memory chip is great.  

As anyone with a digital camera knows, taking photos becomes so inexpensive that you have no reason not to take 3 or 4 or 5 photos when the opportunity presents itself.   Now, for me, the biggest issue is managing these hundreds of photos on my PC.

I checked on the price of this product at CompUSA on March 28, 2001.  It costs $399.
