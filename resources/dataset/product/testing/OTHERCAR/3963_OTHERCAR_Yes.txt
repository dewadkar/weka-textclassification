            I recently traded in my 1995 Toyota Camry for a 2000 Saturn LS2. I went to the Toyota dealership first and was not treated like they wanted me there, so I went next door to the Saturn dealer, what a difference! 

I purchased from Saturn partly because of thier service and and group &quot;personality&quot;. They really are just like their commercials. One of the best features was the creature comforts at the dealership while you wait. The waiting area had a TV/VCR with several good movies, a mini fridge with free sodas, some cookies, donuts, etc. There were a couple of couches and easy chairs around a coffee table and end tables, with a gas fireplace in the back. It was so homey. There was a separate kids room where the lower half of the room was all chalkboard. It had a separate TV equipped with nintendo (or sega) and several good games, along with puzzles, coloring books etc.

When I first drove the L series, I started with the L1, not wanting to spend too much money, as I was supposed to be looking for another used Camry (a lease turn back). It was ok, but the engine never had the powerful, full sound or feel that the Camry had. After talking to my husband, I went back and tried the LS2 with the V6 engine. What a difference. It was more powerful and rich sounding, like a sports car. The salesman suggested I leave the Camry and take the LS2 home for the weekend to try it out, and so that my husband could try it. 

I was sold! The interior has a quality look and feel to it. I especially liked the black, which I believe will look cleaner longer than their tan or grey options. The engine is powerful and fast. I checked it against our friends Grand Am V6 Turbo, ours is a little faster (he's horrified a Saturn beats his Grand Am). The steering is tight, and the steering wheel itself feels good, leather like. The acceleration and braking are excellent as well. It is a comfortable 5 passenger that will accommodate all five unless ALL 3 in the back are quite heavy. Another great feature are the rear cup holders. They are in the flip down arm rest in the middle, so with 3 people in the back you can't use it, but luckily I usually only have 2 in the rear. The front seat cup holders are nice in that they accommodate two 20 oz soda bottles, or you can remove the rubber liner to accommodate fatter water bottles, or similar containers.

The seats have a great soft material, slightly fuzzy, and super (adjustable) lumbar support. The sport suspension was different than what I had, but I got used to it. I also like the engine features, like a battery cover and separate jump connections so you aren't connecting right to the battery. It's a very cool looking engine with it's 24 valve overhead cam.

As a not so organized type, I also like that a reminder light comes on that says &quot;change oil soon&quot;, somewhere between 3000-5000 mi., depending on my driving. The car has traction control for ice, or sand slippage as well. I purchased the ABS brakes and sunroof (which can both slide and tilt) and the upgrade stereo and spoiler. All nice touches. My kids like the flip down rear seats so they can store and get things from the trunk, they think it's pretty cool.

I have about 4000 miles on it now, and I've found nothing wrong, no rattles, squeaks, etc. I find it to be a high quality auto with many great features. I would not trade it in for a brand new Camry. In fact, I'd rather keep and pay for the Saturn, than take a free Camry!

I love my car! I still look forward to driving it each day. It's a lot of fun and has tons of pick up when you want to have fun or have to pass. I would recommend this car to anyone.<br><br>
