            I originally purchased this camera from an UBID auction.  I have been looking at various cameras and prices but they were all so expensive.  I was happy I won the bid, I figured the Polaroid name would be a good choice.  My camera was refurbished but carried the 1 year warranty direct from Polaroid.  I received my camera and have loved it ever since!  I even purchased another one for a friend!  

The camera is easy to use.  It comes with a 2mb memory card and you can purchase up to an 8mb one.  The software is easy to install and use.  The only problem I encountered is it would not upload pictures when I had too many programs open, this was easily solved with a quick call to their wonderful customer service personnel!

I take this camera everywhere and purchased rechargeable batteries for it so it is economical to have and use as well!<br><br>
