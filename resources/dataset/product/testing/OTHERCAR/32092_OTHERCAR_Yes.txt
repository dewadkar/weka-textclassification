            Test Car: 
2000 Chrysler 300M

Interior: 
The 300M has a very nice quality interior.  Panel and dash are seamlessly integrated and fit excellently.  Leather heated seats are very nicely designed and quite comfortable.  Retro styling of gauges and vents give the interior a nice, distinctive look.  This is a car of details.  It's the little things that you won't notice right away that make this car so pleasant to drive.  High quality leather steering wheel has cruise and stereo controls within finger reach.  The steering wheel and door handles have molded finger grooves for exceptionally comfort and control.  Layout of all buttons is superbly placed.  Center cup holders are well placed.  Center console is nice, but small.   Digital temperature control makes regulation quick and painless.  Air conditioning is very effective and heat is available quickly in winter.  The 60/40 fold down rear seats provides massive trunk space and versatility.  With seats up, this car comfortably fits 5, with plenty of space and leg room.  The speaker system is a real pleasure.  The CD player never skips.  Sound is accurately reproduced for a factory stereo and audio distortion is minimal at high volumes.  The only flaw I've noticed is rear window visibility isn't great.

Exterior: 
This car looks sharp.  The exterior has clean lines and a sleek, luxury look.  17" mag wheels fit the car well.  Stubby trunk lid makes getting things in and out a chore.  Cargo net is greatly appreciated though.  Doors seal nicely, but don't have the airtight quiet of some other imports.  Road noise is minimal, but there are quieter cars out there.

Engine and Suspension: 
Although it might not look like it, this is a very sporty car.  The power of this car is surprising; as it&#146s potent V6 cranks out 250hp.  The acceleration is strong and impressive.  The 4 speed automatic transmission with overdrive is fairly smooth.  Chrysler also added their auto stick feature, which allows for manual shifting by tapping the gear shift left or right.  This feature is more of a novelty then anything else, but it is a fun feature that gives the driver much more control.  The suspension is refined and surprisingly capable.  This car corners well, it stands up very well to its European rivals.  There is slight play in the steering wheel though.

Economy: 
The fuel economy of this car is better then expected.  The car is rated at 18mpg city and 26mpg highway.  My experience tells me those numbers are actually a little underrated.   

Reliability: 
Reliability is something that varies tremendously.  I currently have 28k miles on this car and have only had one problem so far (fan was rubbing, fixed quickly by dealership).  Others I have talked to have had no problems at all, and yet this car is getting a reputation for reliability issues.  From the research I've done, I haven't found any common problems other then the rotors warp quickly.  The people that have had problems with this car have had many problems, like they have gotten a lemon.  The others that I have talked to haven't had any problems.  I don't know if it is a quality control problem at Chrysler or what.  The majority of the owners that I have read from have had no problems so far.  

Misc: 
As I said before, the rotors warp quickly.  Do NOT replace these rotors with Chrysler rotors, they all warp.  I have talked to Chrysler and they know the problem exists and are not going to do anything about it.  Get aftermarket rotors, like Brembo, they are high quality, affordable replacements.

Driving Experience:
Driving this car is a multidimensional pleasure; you look good, you're comfortable, and you know you've got power on demand.  Stop and go traffic is much more tolerable when driving in a car you are confortable in and happy with.  This car will supply that.  I'll warn you though, the urge to take this car out on the highway might just be overwhelming, it was for me.  Go ahead, you'll love the acceleration and power.  This is a fairly heavy car, but it corners with European precision and authority.  This sedan is a wolf in sheep's clothing.  My adivse:  test drive this car, hit the highway, crank the stereo and enjoy.
  
People who are interested in this car should also look at:
1.  Lexus ES 300
2.  Acura TL
3.  Audio A4
5.  Oldsmobile Aurora
6.  Infinity G35
7.  BMW 3-Series

Final thoughts: 
Chrysler hit one out of the ballpark with the 300M.  The car is very capable in a performance setting and is quite refined and luxurious for the price.  The inside of this car is extremely roomy; it&#146s a terrific family car.  This is a very nice car with terrific bang for the buck.
