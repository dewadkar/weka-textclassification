            The Chevrolet Cavalier that I owned was only the second vehicle that I ever owned (1990 Cavalier being the first).  My mother sold it to me in 1998 for the rock bottom price of $1,000.  You don't come by a deal like that every  day.  
 
I kept that car for two years before selling it to my sister for $800 ( she got a good deal too).  In those two years I had minimal trouble with the vehicle.  The only serious problem I had with it was when, I had to replace the head gasket, around the time the odometer reached 175,000 miles. The car had over 210,000 miles on it when I sold it.  The anti-lock brake system never failed on me, even in the snow.  The gas mileage was always good. I only spent $15.00 a week for gas, and I had to drive at least 15 miles to go work, shop, or eat at a restaurant (Yes I live in the middle of nowhere).  The shocks and struts always held up through my reckless teenage driving down country roads.  

As far as appearance goes, this is not a Porsche, but it beats an Aries.  When well kept this car is nice.  For a sporty look, a small fin on the back looks nice.
 
The front seats are fairly roomy, but the back is a little cramped.  Anyone more than 5'9&quot; tall should ride in the front.  It is easy to drive, with all the standard features, like anti-lock brakes, power steering, and  easily accessible controls.

I would recommend this car to anyone who wants dependability, affordability, and a decent looking car all in one.
