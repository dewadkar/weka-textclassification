            You know, I was never much of a BMW fan. I remember looking at them in the 80's and early 90's and I would see knobs on the dash when other cars were using sliders or push buttons, and analog gauges when others were using digital, and I'd think, "What's all the hoopla?" Then along came the Z3 Roadster. I remember seeing one drive past me for the first time in the mid-90's and thinking, "Whoa! It's like a mini-batmobile!" I still wasn't thrilled with what I considered to be old-style controls in what I knew many considered to be a high-tech auto, but I was so taken with the car's looks that I decided I could live with the old-fashioned cockpit. So I got a '97 Z3 Roadster.

And then I understood. The controls in the BMW are deceptively simple, because a lot of the thought that the driver usually has to put into adjusting things is built into the system itself. Take the windshield wipers as an example. They have three settings: intermittent, low, and high. If you're like me, you would think that a luxury car like the BMW should have more settings to let you change the intermittent rate to adjust for the amount of rainfall. What I didn't realize before I owned a BMW, is that the car adjusts the wiper speed for you depending upon the speed of the car. No need to bother the driver with such a trivial task!

The Z3 is filled with lots of these thoughtful design features. Like the power windows that go all the way down or up with a single press, and still operate after you turn off the ignition until you actually lock the car. Like the engine computer that watches the way to drive to optimize fuel efficiency and alerts you as maintenance time approaches. Like the battery jumper terminals in the engine compartment, even though the battery is in the trunk.

As you can tell, these are the things that really matter to me. I'm much less concerned about performance, which is why I'm probably perfectly happy with the 4-cylinder engine. I've heard a number of other Z owner's complain that the small engine model is under-powered, but it has plenty of power for me. The car drives like it's on rails, and on those occasions when it does start to slip, the automatic traction control kicks in to keep things stable.

My only real complaint about the Roadster is that it doesn't use "off-the-shelf" parts and fittings, so anytime you want to do anything yourself, you need to see the BMW dealer. Other than that, I'm a born-again and baptized beemer convert. Say hallelujah!
