            I own a '96 Buick Riviera I bought in March 1999. It had 47,000 miles on it and it is in mint condition. It came with everything imaginable. Some of my favorite features are the supercharged engine, leather interior, heated  driver's seat with two position memory, great sound system, and huge trunk.
It is a solid, powerful machine that rides like heaven and corners like its on rails, and the back seat is so roomy, my passengers say it's like sitting on a living room sofa! Don't mistake it for a boat though. It's sleek and sexy, and turns heads everywhere we go. It has chrome illusion paint that changes from green to blue to purple depending on what kind of light it's viewed in.

I would tell anyone that this is the best performing and greatest looking car on the market. Get one if you can, new or used, you won't regret it.
