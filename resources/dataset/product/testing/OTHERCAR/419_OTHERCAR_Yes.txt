             We purchased this car used in September 1999. Friends assumed it was brand new! The ride is the smoothest imaginable. The leather is like the LS400's. The stereo is incredible, the controls are easily accessible and user friendly. There are so many wonderful things about this car. The front and back are both extremely roomy, not cramped. 
  I never had any mechanical problems with this car and there are no signs of any surfacing. Driving it is incredible. The ride is so smooth, I feel like I'm on air. I never feel a bump. There is no body roll at all. The engine is so incredibly quiet, friends have sometimes questioned if it is really on! There is absolutely no wind noise, even on the highways, so conversations are carried through well and music is heard loud and clear. 
  I know it did very well in the crash tests. It has a feature so that in a front end crash, the engine will drop down so it will not be a threat to passengers. I feel safe driving this car with my children. 
  The only bad thing about this car is the price. I paid $24,000 for a '96 model with about 40,000 miles. But I have seen better deals after the purchase.
  I love this car and would recommend it to anyone. Enjoy!<br><br>
