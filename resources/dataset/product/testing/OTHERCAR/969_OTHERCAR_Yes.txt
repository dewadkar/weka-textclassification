            This camera is a reasonable price for what you get.  It has lots of features, including zoom, and I found it easy to use.  It came with an adapter and software to download the pictures from the camera.  The worst part about it is the terrible battery life.  I find it takes 2 photo's with flash before changing the batteries, and 10 without flash.  The 4 MB memory allows for 12 pictures at medium-high resolution, so the batteries don't last for the full memory in either case.  It does have an plug in adapter, if you happen to be near an outlet while taking pictures.  The error messages have been pretty confusing for me as well.  It also comes with a case, which I appreciate - I carry it with me everywhere, as well as extra batteries.<br><br>
