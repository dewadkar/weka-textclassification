            My husband and I recently bought a 2000 Saturn SL1.  The car is a pure joy.  It rides smooth and looks good.  We wanted something affordable yet attractive, so I had my eye on a 2000 Pontiac Sunfire Sedan, but my husband wasn't sure that he wanted to go with a Sunfire.  

We decided to check out the Saturn dealership here in Irving, Texas.  Other than the fact that they have provided us with a really good car, their service was super.  The salesman, Paul, answered all of our questions and was extremely friendly.  I know... I know...  you're probably saying to yourself, "Come on.  He's a salesman.  His job is being friendly."  That's true, too.  But some people are, or at least appear, to be genuinely friendly, while others give off the impression that they have to work at being nice to you.  Paul seemed to be a genuinely friendly and a knowledgeable salesman.  

Also, we have a two year old son who tends, like most toddlers, to get rambunctious and hyper if forced to sit for too long.  Paul, as well as the other Saturn employees, were very kind and attentive to him.  I know that seems trifle, but as a mother, it's very important to me that my son be treated well if you want my business.  The people at Saturn met and went beyond our expectations.

Now for the car's performance.  As I mentioned, this is a recent purchase, so my opinion may change later down the road.  As it stands, I enjoy the car very much.  The engine is pretty quiet.  It doesn't really have as much of a "kick" to it as some might like.  For my needs, the car is perfect.  My husband, on the other hand, has mentioned that he'd prefer a bigger engine that will give him more power on the highway.  Since this car is mainly for my use and I'll be using it mostly for driving around town, a more powerful engine is unnecessary.  For those of you who are looking for the more powerful engine, it's my understanding that's the main difference between the SL1 and the SL2.  They both have the same size engine, but the SL2 is supposed to provide more of a kick at higher speeds.    

As far as the brakes go, they are not as sensitive as some other cars have.  I personally like them as they are.  I feel the car brakes more smoothly, but if you prefer sensitive brakes then you wouldn't care for the ones on the Saturn SL1.  

The interior of the car is also great for my needs. The front seat provides plenty of room for me and my husband.  Neither of us is outrageously tall, so if you're well over six feet tall, you may want to bear into consideration that I'm only 5'9" and my husband is 5"11.  As I said though, we have plenty of leg room in the front seat.  As for the back seat, I wouldn't say it's cramped, but I personally prefer more leg room than what the back offers.  Since my two year old will be the one riding in the back, it offers plenty of room for our needs.  Also, the trunk is very spacious, but if extra extra cargo space is needed, the back seats fold down to provide it.  

We've had the car now for just over a week, and Paul has already called just to find out how things are going with it.  I'm impressed with the lengths Saturn goes to make sure their customers are satisfied.  My husband and I are very happy with the car and even more impressed with the excellent service.

UPDATE:  We have now had our Saturn for a few months and my opinion is the same.  I love the car.  It's performance is outstanding.  It has great gas mileage (which is wonderful with such high gas prices) and runs beautifully.  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
SECOND UPDATE:  We've now had our Saturn for over a year.  Absolutely no problems at all.  We still get excellent gas mileage.  We are still receiving personal attention from the salesman who sold us the car, even though we have moved to another city and so has he.  And there have been no changes in the performance of the car.  I absolutely love it!
