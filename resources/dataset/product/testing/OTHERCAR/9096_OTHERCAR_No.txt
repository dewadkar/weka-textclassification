             I bought a '99 Sportage EX in Oct. '99 because it seemed to be a nice 4x4 for the right price. Boy was I fooled! Within a month of buying it, the problems started and have not ceased. Where do I begin? First the brake light came on then went off, nothing found by the dealer. Then I had transmission and 4x4 transfer case problems and still do. Oh, did I say it also suddenly accelerates, and the cruise control varies from 55 to 75 mph when set at 65mph. Yet the dealer still finds no problems. Then there was the antifreeze leak that has been in for repair 4 times now although the dealership fixed it once. Of course the engine light comes on and off,but again there's &quot;nothing wrong with it.&quot; We also can't forget all the cosmetic problems which include; wheel trim moldings coming off, paint peeling off molding, seals around all windows pulling off,the moldings around the front and rear windows are pitted and faded. All this with currently 9,000 miles. By the way, I have had parts ordered since April '00.They must have been dropped in the ocean.
  I have since filed with the BBB, my Attorney General, NHTSA and Kia(haha,what a joke that is). For all my troubles Kia wants to send me 4 car payments along with a document stating I will not sue them if I accept their offer.
Guess what? I told them I would see them in arbitration. Wish me luck, and please do yourself a favor, Don't Buy A Kia!<br><br>
