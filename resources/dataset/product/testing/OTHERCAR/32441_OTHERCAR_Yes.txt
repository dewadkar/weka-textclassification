            I was excited to see what the car industries would come out with in the year 2,000, but I've been disappointed. Nothing has been exciting, bold, or new... nothing has conveyed to me YEAR 2000... except the Ferrari 360 Modena.

The 360 Modena has the beauty and style that is Ferrari. When you look at it, it is clearly a Ferrari, and borrows from previous models, yet it looks like something that has come out of the future. From every angle, the car is interesting, exciting, bold, futuristic, and... beautiful.

But beauty is only skin deep. Fortunately, the 360 Modena also performs. The car is light weight and well balanced. From what I have heard, it handles extremely well. Pure grace. At the same time, it has a whopping 500 horsepower engine that will give an American muscle car a run for its money.

Cutting edge technology and superior craftsmanship went into this car. Ferrari is infamous for having cars with horrible reliability records, 5 figure annual maintenance bills, and a lack of practicality. Not so with the 360 Modena, which is the first Ferrari to have door pockets. The car has enough storage space for a weekend trip, and... it is supposed to be RELIABLE.

The price tag is high, but for any car enthusiast who can afford it, this car seems to be worth every penny. Considering that it's the cheapest of the 3 Ferrari models still in production, and it's the best performing of the 3, this car is very reasonably priced.

The 360 Modena is a new breed of Ferrari that is both exotic AND practical (for those who can afford it). The fact that there is already a two year waiting list to buy one is testimony to this car. With the possible exception of the McLaren F1, this very well may be the best production sports car ever built.<br><br>
