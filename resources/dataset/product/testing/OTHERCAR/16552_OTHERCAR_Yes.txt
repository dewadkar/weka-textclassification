                 We bought this vehicle because our 2 door Mercury Cougar was getting a little cramped for the five of us.  It was in good shape, no visible oil leaks, & cool air conditioning (important for our long stretch of 105+ degree heat in Dallas).  

     The interior was perfect except the driver's seat where it rubs against the driver's leg climbing in and out.  I love all the little places you can store items.  There is a compartment on the dash we keep the kids Disney tapes in.  Glove compartment is good for paper work and storage.  Down below in the middle is a place to store change, divided up into quarters, dimes and nickles and more space behind it.  Above our heads is a place for the garage door opener.  It's a little small to climb around in if one of the kids is in trouble but i can still make it all the way to the back pretty easily.  

     The gas mileage makes it all worth while.  I was driving my old pickup to work sometimes and I figured out I would pay less for the van then I would for gas alone in the pickup.  

     The ride is very smooth, has good acceleration and is easy to maneuver.  I would recommend this to any family who is looking for a well built mini-van and plenty of space.  There are 7 seats and 2nd and 3rd rows are removable for cargo room.
