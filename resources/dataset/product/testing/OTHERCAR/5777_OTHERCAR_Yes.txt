            I recently decided to get involved in the digital photography arena and believe me going into this I had no idea what to look for.  Thanks to Epinions and the Internet itself, I was able to do what I believe to be thorough research.  My search for the perfect camera to suit my families needs actually began when I decided I need a better over-all Printer.  That is another story in itself, but I will tell you I ended up purchasing the HP Photosmart 1218 which is the perfect printer for this camera.

Well, back to this review.  After making my decision on the printer, it was time to decide what camera to purchase.  Now HP has a line of cameras made specifically for its' PhotoSmart printer but some flags came up in doing my homework on their HP C500.  It seems that the reviews I read on it were not favorable at all.  Yes, it did have the HP Infrared Jet Scan feature that allows you to send your photos directly to the printer without taking the Card out of the camera (it works much like a remote control does with a TV), but the over-all quality of the camera was rated very low for the cost.  

Now I am a big HP person and I know they stand for quality, but I was not to sure a to their history with camera so I decided to go to the field and see for myself.  Much to my surprise, no one locally carried that camera (only the C200 which is quite a step down).  That when I came upon the D-490 Zoom.  My wife and I played with it alittle at the store and immediately we knew we had to give this camera serious consideration.  It had a nice outer look to it.  It had both your optical view finder and the basic 1.8 LCD Monitor (that also allows you to zoom in on playback mode which sold my wife).  The sliding Lens Cover was a nice benefit although it takes some getting use to, but you can't lose it.  The Menu is very easy to follow after looking over the enclosed manual.  Best thing of all is I just take my SmartMedia Card out of the camera and pop it right into the built-in card reader in my HP PhotoSmart 1218 and WHALLA I've got photos.

I never knew it would be so easy.  My family and I like to travel, my wife is always asking about taking family portraits, relatives are wanting pictures from time to time and I am very much involved in different activities.  Now I can take as many photos whenever and wherever I want.  I purchased both an additional 16 MB and 32 MB SmartMedia Card along Rechargeable Battery Kit.  We are set to meet our needs for some years now.   <br><br>
