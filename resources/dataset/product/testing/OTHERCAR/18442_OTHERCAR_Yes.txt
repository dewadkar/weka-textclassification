            My husband and I had been wanting a sport utility and were seriously considering the Jeep Grand Cherokee.  Once we shopped around and realized how completely overpriced they were, we decided to look at others.  We looked at the Dodge Durango which we were not impressed with at all, the Oldsmobile Bravada, again nothing to be impressed with and the Explorer.  I didn't care for the body style of the explorer. So we finally settled on and bought a 2001 GMC Jimmy.  Black with gold and silver trim along the bottom, fully loaded with all extras.  I must say, I have never been happier with a vehicle as I am with this SUV.  It is just a beautiful truck.  I am very pleased with the way it rides and handles for an SUV.  Cornering isn't nearly as &quot;scary&quot; as I thought it would be with all the talk about how they they tend to tip easily.I am especially impressed with all of the little extras that GMC thought of when designing this vehicle. I am especially impressed with the heated mirrors.  The radio plays for 20 minutes after you have taken the key out until you open any of the doors.  Especially thoughtful for your passengers who are waiting in the car while you run into the store for a minute.  Another feature which I love is the window lockout button on the driver's side.  Especially in light of the fact that I have a very curious 3 year old who would just love to put the window up and down and up and down and maybe even throw things out if given the opportunity.  The 8 way adjustable power  seats make for a very comfortable ride for a person of any size. GMC also had safety in mind when they designed the keyless entry system.  They designed it so that if you push the unlock button once on your keyring, it only unlocks the driver's door.  (just in case in the &quot;big city&quot; you have some maniac who is chasing you, they will not have access to the other doors unless you push the button again).  Not very likely that this will happen but inventive nonetheless.  <br>The only downfall which I have noticed but gotten used to is the acceleration which can tend to be a little doggie.  If you want to really motor up a hill, you have to practically floor it.  But it is certainly there if you need it.  The CD player Bose stereo system really kicks it but I would have also liked an additional cassette player as well.   I guess had I ordered the truck, I may have had that option, but I picked it off the lot.  The pros more than outweigh the cons and I would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a nice impressive smooth  ride.<br><br><br>
