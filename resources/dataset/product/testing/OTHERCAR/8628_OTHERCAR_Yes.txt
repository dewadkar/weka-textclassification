            When my wife told me she wanted a minivan, I thought she was losing her mind.  When she convinced me she was serious, I went through the gamut over available minivans, starting with used Chrysler products.  After rejecting those late model used vans for high prices and cheap construction, I started looking at Toyota's and Honda's.  I liked the Toyota's for their build quality, but the handling suffered (drove like my Lincoln-sluggish)and I disliked having to remove the rear bench seat for more cargo space.  Finally driving the Honda, I was won over with the handling, silky smooth engine, and versatile cargo area.  The ability to make a flat rear cargo area is great, and I don't have to remove the rear seat to do it.  The small touches added are pure Honda, such as the drink holders, dual A/C controls (standard-not optional as on other minivans), the ability to have tailgate parties with the power jack and rear reversing seat, etc.  Not to mention Honda's reliability and resale value for a price that compares favorably to the domestic vans.  The engine bay itself is a total work of art!  Wow!
