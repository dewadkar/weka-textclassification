            Ok. I admit it, as soon as I saw one of these in a store, and saw a friend use one of their own. I was hooked. The fact that for a few bucks you could buy a pack of floppy disks and go on a photography rampage played a major role in my deciding to purchase one. 

I got mine and imedietely went out taking pictures of my car, the main reason I wanted it. I could now take instant pictures for my web page and have them up on the site in a few minutes. I also found out that it's an invaluable tool for class projects requiring a camera. It takes pics from 640X480 to 1280X960 (also 3:2 format). The image quality is great, not perfect, but close enough to a normal photo quality to make it worthwhile. 

You can hold many pictures on one floppy, or 15 seconds of full motion video. It also supports a floppy adapter that you can insert a SONY memory stick into and use all the way up to a 64 meg stick, to hold many more pictures than just having a floppy. It has a nice little LCD screen on the rear that you aim and shoot the pictures with, a few reply features, index feature, b/w, sepia, and a couple other effects that you can use to change the look of you're picture. 

It has 3X optical zoom with digital zoom ( a little further distance) supported. Nice flash feature that is adjustable to different brightness settings. Very ergonomic and user friendly. I figured it all out within a few days not even touching a manual. 

Overall, buy this camera if you like what you read. If not, then look further into other options, but I can tell you one thing....I love it:)
