            After driving an 88 Jeep Cherokee for 7 yrs, I decided to start looking for another SUV. I spent almost a year looking at various SUV's while driving a company leased 96 Explorer XLT.

Qualifications for my next SUV: more cargo room than the Cherokee, easier access to back seats and more leg room than the Cherokee, higher line of sight than Cherokee, higher ground clearance than the Explorer, and better 4 WD performance than Explorer.

Initial research on the internet narrowed my choices to the Montero, Trooper, and Explorer based on cargo room and creature comforts. Two 94 Monteros were test driven but I did not like the feel of sitting up over the steering wheel. I also test drove another Explorer but still did not like the low ground clearance. The two Troopers that I test drove were comfortable, quite, and provided a great view due to high clearance and all the windows. The 96 Trooper met my quals and got it at a better price than other comparably equipped SUV's

One other reason why I bought a Trooper is that there are less of them on the streets and a local Jeep/Isuzu dealer mechanic stated that less Troopers came in for repairs.

I love the comfort of the Trooper and easier ride compared to my Jeep and especially to an 88 Trooper. After a long road trip in the 88 model, I swore to never buy one. The Trooper has come a long ways since 88. I have used the 4WD twice w/o any problems. Got me out of two mildly stuck situations. Have not had a chance to really test the 4WD system. What I hate most about the 96 Trooper is the limited use 4WD system. I miss the full time 4WD of the Jeep in times of heavy rains when extra traction may be helpful on paved roads.

Driving is comfortable with good visibility. Can see over all cars and thru minivans, trucks, and other SUV's. There is enough horsepower to jump into traffic and maintain a constant speed thru hilly terrain. Upon buying vehicle took a ski trip to WVA. Cruise control maintained constant speed up fairly steep grades.

Who should buy? Families of 4 looking for a safer ride than an car, and outdoor enthusiasts. Who shouldn't? Families greater than 5. Families with children less than 3 should stick with a mini-van so that you can go back and forth between front and back seats.<br><br>
