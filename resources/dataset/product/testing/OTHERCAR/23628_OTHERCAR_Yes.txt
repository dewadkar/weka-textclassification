            I owned a firebird as my 1st car and was not happy about the prospects of getting a SUV as a gift.  Realy wanted to stick with speed.  Boy was I wrong.  I love my JEEP.  I can drive in just about any weather and the only thing I have to worry about is the other drivers.  When I throw that puppy into 4x4 and ice is no problem for me.  Saftey aside, I love the fact that I can clear any sidewalk in the world, saving time when parking in a large lot.  (Don't try that at home).  The JEEP is realy a nice looking car, and I have never had one problem with it.  I also love the fact that I can fit just about anything I need into it.  When I was in College I could pick up everything I owned and pack it away for a trip home, or to a new apartment.  I don't need speed now in my life, just more space for my stuff.<br><br>
