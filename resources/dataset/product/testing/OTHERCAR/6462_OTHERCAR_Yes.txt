            I fell in love with my Camry the first time I drove it.... Have owned Honda, Mazda, Audi, GM, Voyager...etc... but nothing compares to my Camry.  Not even my German Audi.... I get an average of 25 mpg in the city &amp; 27 to 29 on the hwy... (4 cyl.) &amp; plenty of power... Love the overdrive &amp; PWR switch for driving in lots of traffic.  Quiet ride &amp; a great A/C... 
The Paint holds up well &amp; car looks new.
The inside also looks great &amp; feels comfortable, very quiet on the road.
It is a great car for a long trip, you don't ache in your bones.
Also like the fact that the Camry keeps its resale value over the years.
I would reccomend the Camry to everyone... 
 I could go on &amp; on.... Bob<br><br>
