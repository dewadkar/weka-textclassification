            SO.. Lookin' at an S-10, are ya? Or maybe you already have one. 

They certainly are great little trucks. Some will run forever! Some... won't.

Case In Point:

We purchased a '91 Chevy S-10 pickup in 1995 with the 2.5L engine and 30,000 miles. Shortly after it was bought, 30 days to be exact, the engine threw a rod from piston 2 right through the bottom of the engine. &quot;Eh&quot;, we said, &quot;no big deal&quot;, put a new engine in it, costing about 1000$, and we were on our way again.

Shortly after that, this truck started to obtain much of a personality. 

After 3/4 ton motor home springs were installed in the front, Add-a-Leaf's in the back, a 400 pound steel beam bumper in the front, 3 pairs of off-road lights, 4 antennae (we are amateur radio enthusiasts), first a blue paint job, then a camouflage paint job, and then a flat black paint job, a very heavy window limousine tint, too-big Wild Country RVT tires, and a big stereo... the truck resembled what one might call a &quot;cockroach&quot;. (It was two wheel drive by the way.)

The truck survived 3 accidents; one from the rear at 50mph (needed a new bed after that), one into a creek at 35mph (new front-end), and then becoming a lawn-dart at about 45mph (thanks to that 400lb bumper, the truck was OK after that one). Thank goodness parts are cheap for American cars!

EVERYTHING had pretty much been replaced in the truck except for the cab and frame by now.

And it still RAN! It got us through the worst of times, and through the best of times. It saw many places of our desert and mountains that a four wheel drive may not go. Things like wading through a river, or wading through two foot deep dust (which amazingly, does act an awful lot like wading through a river).

The truck became part of our family. 

Sadly, on a trip back from the mountains one nice Autumn eve, it blew it's second engine after 120,000 miles. Same thing, piston 2 threw a rod through the bottom of the engine. NONE of the engine blowing was done on purpose mind you!

However, the S-10 legacy still lives on within us, because we have now upgraded to a '97 S-10 two wheel drive with the 4.3 Vortec, and it is WELL on it's way to looking like the other one. (Tint, antennae, stereo, lights.. you know the story..)
