            Are you looking for a quality digital camera, but can't afford a megapixal camera.  Look no further, I have the answers for you!

I purchased my PDC-640 before Christmas, so I could upload photo's to the internet.  What a fun thing to own.  I carry it with me all the time since I purchased it.  

Do you want to send pictures of the kids to grandma, snap! Do you want to sell something on an online auction, snap!  Do you want to add your picture to a greeting card, snap!  Opps don't like the picture, delete and retake.  35mm cameras should be this easy.

If your looking for real photo quality, make your own film, save your money for a better camera.  But if you just want to have some fun with your computer, this is the camera for you.

It comes with 2mb flash card that holds 12 to 36 photos depending on your resolution.  It has a led screen to preview your photos or view when deciding on that perfect shot.  It comes with great software to edit photos.  A serial cable for downloading and a power cord to save on batteries.

Take this with you everywhere and you'll never miss a chance for a good photo.  Here are a couple tips for using this camera.

1) Use the power cord when able to save on batteries, all dig. cameras eat batteries.
2) Look online for a good deal on a 8mb card and shoot till your heart desires.  Got mine for $15.

Look for the cameral at walmart and enjoy!!!
