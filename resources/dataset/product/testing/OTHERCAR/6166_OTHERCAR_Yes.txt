            And we are amazed at how great it was! The ride was very smooth and gas mileage was even better than what the window sticker reported. Our two huge dogs, toddler in a car seat, and about 1000 lbs of cargo on both the roof rack and inside would scare most people into taking a plane. With the Venture, we still had room for our assortment of maps, books, etc., and even had one of those portable plug in fridges in the back. We have the optional air pump and hose and it has come in handy so many times. The controls are all in the right spots and easy to locate without having to take your eyes off the road. The cloth seats have proven themselves very durable as they have so far outlasted our toddler and our desire to use it for everything from groceries to hauling building and landscaping supplies.
 
I have found that the seats are easy to remove and reinstall- kind of a no brainer there. If you don't want to remove them, the very back row folds up to create a lot of cargo space. Front seats have storage space beneath for everything you have a need to store and if that isnt enough, there are strategically placed cargo nets between the front row seats and one for in the back across the tail gate and other places for storage as well. There are tons of cup holders in this vehicle..enough for everyone to have two drinks! Rear air and radio controls have been a plus as well. We almost bought a 2000 but the 1999 was a better buy for the options we got plus the controls are different in the '00 and not as appealing. If you are considering a '99, this is a nice van with affordable bells and whistles. This was a very well thought out vehicle plan. 

Another thing to think about is safety. Our van has front as well as side impact bags. Our sliding door has a feature that makes it slide back in case something gets caught in it. I would like it to have more sensitivity so it would not have to go so far before it would release, say, a toddler or an elderly person. If you leave your signal on after your turn for too long, a signal will beep an alarm at you. The locks automatically lock after putting your van into drive and will make warning signals if the sliding door is being operated.
