            I bought this camera for my wife's birthday, now she's not the most techno-savvy woman on the face of the earth, but, she does well with this one.  The camera is moderately priced at around $300-$360.00 

The camera is easy to use, and has few of the high end bells and whistles of more expensive cameras (but that's why this is a low end camera).  It makes great photos for web authors, and connects nicely with a photo capable printer.  Though the bundled software &quot;Adobe Photoshop Deluxe&quot;, leaves a lot to be desired.

Great entry level digital camera...definitely not for the professional, but good for taking pictures of the kids at soccer games and making digital records for insurance purposes.<br><br>
