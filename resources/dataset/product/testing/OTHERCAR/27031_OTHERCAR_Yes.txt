            For christmas I recieved the Olympus D-450 Zoom Digital Camera and I have nothing but good things to say about it. I was able to quickly set it up and start shooting pictures in an incredible quality of resolution in a matter of minutes. And if I took a picture I didn't care for, I could simply erase it freeing up space on the memory card for another picture. The camera quickly connected up to my serial port on my computer for the easy transfer of digital pictures from the camera to the computer. The software that came with it has a great user interface and is very easy to use. I would definately recommend this camera if you are looking for a resonably priced digital solution for your media needs.<br><br>
