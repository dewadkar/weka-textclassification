               The new Civic EX for 2001 is a marked improvement over and already successful vehicle, the 2000 Civic EX.  For 2001, the Civic gets a new body style...sportier front fascia, refined taillights, and plastic wheel covers resembling alloy wheels on the BMW 3 series sedans.  
   
   The interior of the vehicle has also been redone for 2001 as well.  The most noticeable change is the &quot;sporty&quot; steering wheel.  The 2000 Civic came factory-equipped with the drab, grey plastic steering wheel...I am pleased to report that for 2001, the Civic sports a black steering wheel, with a larger Honda emblem in the center.  The emergency brake handle also received a face-lift for 2001, contributing to the sportiness of the vehicle's interior.  The dash also has very clean lines, and is laid out in a fashion that allows both driver and passenger easy access to radio and climate control devices.  The passenger compartment is much larger than the prior model year; I owned a 1998 Accord sedan, and the 2001 Civic's interior seems just as spacious as my 98 Accord's interior.  
   
   With the larger VTEC engine, the vehicle has respectable acceleration from a stopped position, as well as in passing on the freeway.  Fuel economy is also another accolade that is no stranger to the Civic line, I have been experiencing an average of 30mpg in the city on 87 octane fuel -quite a plus with rising fuel costs.  Additionally, the handling of the vehicle is surprisingly nimble for an economy sedan...all in all, the 2001 Civic EX is an excellent purchase.  <br><br>
