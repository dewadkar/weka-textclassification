            The Kodak DC-215 is a very good camera. It is not to heavy and comes with a lens cover. Zooming in and out is also a good feature with this camera.
It doesn't matter if you take pictures inside or outside the camera comes with a flash. A very good design was the way the battery holder slides in and out of the camera, but rechargeable batteries are highly recommended! The camera comes with a carrying strap, but no camera case. The way the camera is designed it fits nicely in your hands. You can set the quality of your images and trash an image right there on the spot if you dislike it!<br><br>
