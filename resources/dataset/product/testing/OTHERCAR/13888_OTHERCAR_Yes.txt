            You might recall (or not) that, many epinions ago, I wrote a review of buying my Saturn.  I've now owned said Saturn for almost 3 months, and you all get to hear my opinion as owner (as opposed to opinion as shopper).

First things first, however.  Why did I title this particular epinion &quot;my beloved frog car&quot;?  Because the very first thing I did was grab one of my stuffed frogs and put it in the back window.  This gave me a sense of ownership of the car (as opposed to our minivan, which is my husband insists on keeping personality-free).  

Why did we buy the car?  We needed a second car, and our criteria were something small, something gas efficient, something American made, and no nasty sales pitch.  We had narrowed our choices to the Saturn and the Dodge Neon.  The Saturn won because every article I read emphasized the safety of the Saturn.  Living in the Land of the Bad Driver, this was the deciding factor on why we went with the Saturn.  Because of Saturn's no-haggle policy, I was able to read the company's website, walk in the door of the dealership, and had my car purchased within an hour.  

We bought the four-door SL2, loaded except for the sunroof.  I love having power mirrors.  When my husband drives the vehicles, he gets the mirrors so out of whack for me, and now I can just press a few buttons to get the mirrors reset properly.  

The car is a great size for small people like me and my now-learning-to-drive daughter.  Tilt-wheel steering, which is a standard of the car, allows me to get close enough to the pedals without smacking my knee against the steering shaft (something that happens in the van all the time).  When my husband drives the car, he can also position the steering wheel to something more comfortable for him.  However, this isn't a car made for tall people.  He has to squeeze his long legs in and out and usually grumbles about the fear of getting stuck.  

The Saturn handles nicely in town driving.  I thank the heavens regularly for the braking system -- I can stop on a dime, and the way people run out in front of me around here, being able to stop quickly is imperative.  Gas mileage is pretty decent for in-town driving, about 32 m/g.  I buy gas for the car about once a month, which speaks either for the car's gas efficiency or how little I drive it or both.  I usually refuel the car when it sits at a quarter tank, and gas costs me about $15.  Over Thanksgiving weekend, we had our first snow storm, and the car handled beautifully on the snowy road.

Seating is very roomy in the front seats.  The one time I sat in the back, my daughter was driving, and I sat behind my husband on the passenger side.  He had the seat pushed back for extra leg room, but I was not squished or uncomfortable.  The bucket seats in the front have a lumbar adjuster so the seat can be positioned for your body.  

Now, much as I love my frog car, it is not perfect.  When idling, the car the car is noisy.  The cup holders are inconvenient.  Supposedly there are cup holders built into the door, and there are little indentations there that make a good spot for fast-food french-fry containers, but when I tried putting a cup in there, it didn't fit well at all.  There are two cup holders on the console between the front seats, one that is perfect for the driver, right under the stereo system, and one that is underneath the middle arm rest.  When I drive, I use the arm rest, so that cup holder is no use to the passenger.  When I'm the passenger, it is awkward to reach the cup.  So, really, there is no cup holder for the passenger, and I may have to go back to using the type that hang on the window.  Oh, and one other downfall about the car: it doesn't like hills.  That can be a problem when you live in the mountains (which we do).  The car sputters a little when approaching a hill, and you really have to floor it to get any momentum.  Luckily, town doesn't have a lot of hills, but it does become a problem the moment we're out of town (we're in a valley; to get out of town means going over a mountain).  

In short, the Saturn isn't the perfect car, but I don't think such a thing exists.  It does make me very happy, serving my driving habits in an outstanding manner.  The folks at Saturn keep in touch with us to make sure we remain happy.  Would I buy this car if I had the commute that my co-workers have?  Probably not.  But for in-town commuting, it is a very good automobile.  

Besides, it does look cute with my frogs in it.  <br><br>
