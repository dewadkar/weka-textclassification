            I recently rented a Chevy Blazer for a weekend getaway. I can honestly say
the ride was very silky but the amount of power left lots to be desired. The year I rented was a 2000 model. In all honesty I was very impressed with the vehicle overall. The comfort factor was great and the body style 
superb. The other features that impressed me were the seats, the leg room,
the storage space and last but not least the handling factor. As I mentioned earlier, the only thing I found insufficient was the lack of power on climbing hills. In saying this I may also add, as long as I was on normal terrain everything was fine.
