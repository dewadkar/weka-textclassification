            I bought the vehicle because I am tall (6'1&quot;), and some Chrysler models do not allow the seat to go back far enough.  This model has power seats, with several adjustments that allow the seat to not only go back, but tilt in several different ways.  The fit was perfect.

What I love about the vehicle is the trunk space, and the way the back seat folds down for additional storage.  The net that holds grocery bags in place is also very useful.  The car rides extremely well.  Under the hood, everything is clearly marked for consumer purposes, meaning the basic fluids that one would check are marked in certain colors, eliminating most fluids being put in the wrong receptacle.

I have no complaints about the car.  Everything is worth the money spent.  The 4-wheel disc brakes are a blessing, the car is great on gas, and overall, I would say I made the right decision.

Who should buy this vehicle?  I could not eliminate anyone from NOT buying it.  Even those with families will find ample room in the back seat.<br><br>
