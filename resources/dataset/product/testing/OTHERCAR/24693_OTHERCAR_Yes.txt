            I was in love with my Chevy Cavalier until my husband took it head first into a Volvo.  That same day, before the dust around my car named &quot;Miles&quot; settled, and Miles was on his way to the junkyard, my husband showed up with a 2000 Chevy Venture. I was IMMEDIATELY in love! The ache for &quot;Miles&quot; subsided and I was on the road again.  It rode so smooth.  I hit a speed bump doing about 30 MPH and didn't realize it until my son pointed it out.  Suddenly, I no longer needed a car seat for my daughter.  IT HAD ONE!!  BUILT IN!!!  Finally I have room to take someone other than my direct family somewhere without having to take another car.  I felt like a million bucks (although I certainly didn't spend that much).  I have a new love.  All I need to do now is name him!  

CHEVY FOREVER!!<br><br>
