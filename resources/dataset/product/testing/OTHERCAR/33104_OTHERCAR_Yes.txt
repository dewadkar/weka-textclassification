            I drove my new GMC-Jimmy from Wilmington, NC to my home in Hopkins, MN.yesterday. I left Wilmington at 9:15 a.m.driving mostly on the Interstate Highways, and then on the Ohio and Indiana turnpikes. Because of bad weather e.g.heavy fog from Rockford, IL, light snow from Madison WI, coupled with temperature at 32 I decided not to stop, as I usually do...I drove the 1450 miles, in 23 hours stopping only for coffee, snack food and a 15-20 minute   cat nap at rest areas along the way.Because of the danger of slick ice, due to the temperature I put on the High 4 wheel drive unit, and had no problem in driving.


I have had this car for a number of months and traded in my GMC Vandura, a large conversion van. As such, I am feeling the loss of much more space, when I drive the much smaller Jimmy. I now wish I had bought a larger SUV, because the lack of seating space in the Jimmy e.g it can seat only four people vs up to seven or nine on the larger units.

The Jimmy is good to drive and would fit a young family with two children., It is not suitable for the &quot;soccer mom or dad&quot; I am a senior citizen and generally use it to pick up other seniors and it works out fine.
