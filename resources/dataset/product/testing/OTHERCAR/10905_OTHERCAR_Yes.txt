            Aathif's two identical epinions: &quot;Goodbye to BMW&quot; and &quot;A JOKE! Very little for a lot of your money&quot; on the BMW 3-series are very shallow and unresearched opinions.  His entire premise is that value is everything in a car.  Now value is one consideration, but it isn't necessarily the highest priority for everybody looking for a car.
There are other qualities like handling, performance, build quality, etc.

Aathif writes up a non-review based on one dealership visit and not even a test drive.  Now I'm not going to argue that the BMW 3-series is a great value, because it isn't one of the best, although the 323 isn't bad.  Aathif is correct in pointing out that many features on the 3-series are extra cost options.  Now BMW isn't the only one to charge extra for features like automatic transmissions, moonroofs, leather, etc, but that isn't the point.   

What you get for the base price of a BMW is not a lot of gizmos, but you get incredible handling from the suspension and class-leading performance from the engine.  In the two most important functions of an automobile, handling and acceleration, literally where the rubber meets the road, the BMW 3-series excels.

He then goes into a meaningless, superficial &quot;mine is bigger than yours&quot; comparison of horsepower between the BMW and other cars similar classes.  This is a totally meaningless comparison because, while the cars that he cites have higher horsepower specs, they don't perform better or much better than the BMW 3-series cars.  The Infiniti I30, Toyota Camry V6, and Lexus GS300 (GS400 is not really in the same price class as the 3-series, even a loaded 328i) and the BMW 323i all have 0-60mph times in the 8 second range (with automatic transmissions) despite the other cars having inflated horsepower specs versus the 323i's &quot;mere&quot; 170hp.  With a manual transmission, which is not even available on some of the cars he cites, the 323i gets from 0 to 60 mph in 7.1 seconds.  If you move up to the 328i, you get a class-leading performance of 6.6 seconds, with a &quot;mere&quot; 193 horsepower.  The bottom line is that BMW beats its competition off the line even though their horsepower specs are lower.

What is the explanation for this discrepancy?  How can cars with 225 horsepower be beaten off the line by cars with 170-193 hp?  The truth is, contrary to more consumers' belief, horsepower is not the most important spec to influence acceleration.  In actuality, torque has the strongest influence on 0-60 acceleration times and BMW has concentrated on improving torque in its engines while holding horsepower steady over the past few years.  Horsepower has more influence on the flat-out top speed of the car, which, for this class of cars, is electronically limited at around 130-140mph.  So which spec is really most important to American drivers?  The ability to get to 60mph quickly on a freeway on-ramp, or the ability to drive 140mph?  I'll take the acceleration, and I know most others would too.  The top speeds are fast enough given American speed limits.

So, Aathif faced with the discrepancy of the BMW's less horsepower for the dollar, turns to an old stereotype to explain why anybody would buy these cars.  He says that the only reason that anybody would buy a BMW is for the ego and the image.

Apparently (and he doesn't mention it directly, but you can see it between the lines) he didn't drive one.  Let me tell you where I'm coming from.  I used to be totally anti-BMW because I thought people only bought them for the image and didn't want to be associated with that.  Then I started looking at sports sedans and the Audi A4 was the leading contender.  After driving the A4 and liking it, I tested the BMW 323i just to see what else was out there.  All the ridiculous platitudes spoken about the vaunted BMW handling and performance turned out to be true.  I was caught in cognitive dissonance: I was in love with a car that I didn't want to like.  In addition, the build quality and solidity of the car were much better than the Audi.  I ended up buying a 1999 328i sedan.

It's been said too many times, but there is something to the BMW that is hard to describe in its magical handling and strong, smooth power on demand.  The steering is ultra-precise (one point that the I30 compared negatively to the BMW in reviews), and the dynamic handling and road-holding of the wheels and suspension on twisty roads just provide unspoken confidence and fun while driving. It is just one of those things that you have to drive to experience.  

A market exists for cars that perform at the top of their class and people are willing to pay extra for them, which is why BMW's 3-series sales are soaring with the new model. Maybe you don't care about these things and value is a higher priority for you, but that's ok.  Just don't assume that image is the only reason why people buy BMW's.  (though I admit that this is a reason for many BMW buyers)

And one of these days, go try one for yourself and see if you can feel the difference and viscerally want it.
