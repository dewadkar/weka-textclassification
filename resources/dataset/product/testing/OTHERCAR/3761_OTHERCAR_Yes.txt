            When we went to buy our new pickup, we of course went to the Ford dealer and drove the F-150 (to replace our 14 year old F-150).  We tried a couple of different ones, haggled over price a bit with the dealers, and were just about settled, when we decided to drive a Chevy just for the heck of it.

Well, to make a long story very short, we bought the 2000 Silverado on the spot.  It just DROVE better than the Ford.  The transmission was easier to shift (manual), seating more comfortable, and . . . well we like the looks of it better (I guess we just never got ready for the "round" look).

We now have put about 25,000 miles on this truck and have had no trouble with it at all.  The steering has always made a little chirping-squeeking sound when turning, but we've been assured there is nothing wrong anywhere in the steering system (and have had no performance problems with it).

We use it to tow a small boat trailer and it handles that fine (although you can't use the overdrive gear while towing).  It is a little underpowered when going uphill (we bought the 6 cyl.), but it has plenty of acceleration for us on the flats.  The 6 cyl. has the added advantage (along with the manual tranny) of giving you good fuel economy (for a truck).  We get about 20 mpg on the road.  The 26 gallon gas tank gives you a nice cruising range.
