            First off let me say that prior to purchasing this car I test drove everything from the Chevy Avalanche (great truck) to Lexus and Jaguars.  My first choice would have been the new Infinity G35.  I just wasn't willing to wait until they came out with a manual transmission.  I test drove vehicles over a 3 month period, from February to April, some more than once.  Here's the list, skip it if you like.  Chevy Avalanche, Cadillace CTS, Lincoln LS, Pontiac Grand Am and Bonneville, Toyota Camry and Avalon (the latter is a great car for anyone who doesn't want to know their driving), Acura 3.2TL, Infiniti G35 (Awsome car), Lexus ES300, Jaguar S and X-type and the BMW 3 series.  Hope I haven't left any out.  Of all these cars, I chose the Pearl White Maxima SE with  Sports Package, Gold Trim and every other option.  The price was $27,800.00.  I believe list was around $31,500.00.  The new Altima (which I also test drove) really helped here.  Why I bought this car..  Despite all the press about the older body style, I love the looks, especially the newly designed head lamps.  The car has clean lines and quite an aggressive look.  I'm 6' even and had plenty of head and leg room, even with the optional sun roof.  The power and handling, in my opinion, were equal to the best of the sport sedans listed above for far less money.  The ride was comfortable and quiet on the freeway yet on the twistys there is plenty of feedback through the steering wheel and suspension.  I use the car for every day commuting as well as pleasure trips.  I have to admit that for the first 8,000 miles I was not impressed with the suspension on city streets.  I'm talking bone rattling, teeth jarring stiffness here.  I am glad to report however, that at about 10,000 miles either the suspension softened or I've suffered disk compression and lost all feeling to my butt.  I now have 14,000 miles of pavement between me and the showroom and have loved every mile of it.  The stereo system with in dash 6 disk changer and Bose speakers put out great sound.  All in all, if you love to drive, as I do, this could be the car for you.  There are other models to choose from if you feel the sport suspension is to stiff for you, but I wouldn't have it any other way.  I would buy this car again and that's about the best review I can give it.
