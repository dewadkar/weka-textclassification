            The people at Saturn have put together a winning package. Functional with the right mix of size and looks. Not to mention that the VTi (CVT transmission) is fun to drive. Super low maintenance and enough cargo room for those occasional "big" packages.

This was my first experience with the Saturn method of selling (you pay sticker price )...but it works pleasant and informative.
I have researched this class of vehicles, and while it's out a little late, it surly will catch up.

VTi a winner: Step on the pedal (drive by wire) and the vehicle just goes (no shift points) watch it continue to accelerate after you let up on the pedal as the RPM drops...amazing.

Plastic body panels a winner: Don't worry about the "dings" you press on thes hunks of plastic and they return to place..no impact on safety, as they are attached to a steel space frame.

The 4 cylinder engine: Not a barn burner, but fully capable. This unit is matched with the transmission to provide optimum performance (feel and fuel economy)

Cargo Area: Fold up package "Box', side cubbies, and plenty of tie downs.

Dash layout: Fully functional and intuitive. Yes ...the power window switches are on the center console..but so what they are fine and leave the door uncluttered.

Crash safety: It did very well on the recent government testing. It has a wider track and longer base than most in this class improving in rollover resistance.

If you are willing to make use of the latest transmission technology (CVT) and give up a belt pump and power steering fluid (electric assist rack and pinion) then go for it.
