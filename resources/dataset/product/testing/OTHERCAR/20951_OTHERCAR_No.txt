            I feel it is my duty to express my opinion about this car.  This car turned me off like no other car I have ever driven.  The PT Cruiser is stylish I will give it that.  There is nothing else like it on the market.  It has appealing looks, but beware form does not equal function.  I had the displeasure of renting this car for a business trip.  The PT Cruiser was a 2001 model (Limited Edition) with just over 400 miles on it when I picked it up from the rental company.   I was driving from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, PA.  If anyone know this trip it is a very hilly mountainous ride.  It took me over 20 gallons of gas to make the 300-mile trip?  I could not believe it.  The fuel gauge dropped like a rock dropped from the Empire State Building.  The car would not maintain 65mph on any kind of hill and kept down shifting to maintain its speed.  I gave up on the cruise control about 30 minutes into the trip because I was getting motion sick from the constant down shifting.  So needless to say I drive to Pittsburgh was not a pleasant one, but that is not the end of the story.  While driving in traffic in Pittsburgh the car's electrical system kept cutting out.  I would loose the radio, pwr windows, pwr locks etc. from time to time.  At one point I lost the entire electrical system and it did not come back.  When I got out of the car I smelled something burning, but I could not locate the source.  So I left the car hoping that it would be there when I got back.  It was there when I got back and what do you know the electrical system was running ok too?  The drive back was not quite as bad because it was down hill.  What ever you do not take the car on a long trip!

I really feel this car was designed solely for the 16-20 age group.  Any adult that drives this car will be disappointed unless they are upgrading from a bicycle.  The lack of power and the poor gas mileage make for a bad combination.  If I wanted to get 15 miles to the gallon I would get a Ford Expedition.  At $15,000-$17,000 you get what you pay for.
