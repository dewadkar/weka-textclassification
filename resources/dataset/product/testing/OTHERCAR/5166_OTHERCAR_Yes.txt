            In my opinion, the Dodge Dakota is the best truck for its money. With such a low price and big engine, it is obviously a unique buy. I have had no problems with the truck and it always surprises me with its enormous amount of power. There are only two problems I see with the truck. Number one is its lack of weight in the back of the truck. The combination of rear wheel drive and a light back sometimes causes the truck to skid out or lose traction very easily. This can easily be fixed though with the addition of some weight. Another problem is its small gas tank. I find myself having to refill quite often. Other than that, this truck is very comfortable inside and despite the great amount of power, it is still very controllable. I love my truck and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good deal for their money.<br><br>
