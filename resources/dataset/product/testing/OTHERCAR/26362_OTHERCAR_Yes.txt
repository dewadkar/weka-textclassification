            I had an opportunity to spend a good amount of time riding in and driving a 1999 GMC Jimmy SLS 4wd.  I am truly amazed at how exceptional this SUV really is, and a great value at that!!  I am a car fanatic, and would never consider driving another SUV as my primary vehicle, but I may have to reconsider now.  The example I was in was loaded, CD changer, power leather heated seats, sunroof, running boards, auto climate control, every option on the list nearly, and the owner told me (and I saw the sticker) that is was $31,000.  Trying getting all that in an import SUV for that kind of money!  

The engine was smooth and powerful.  The seats were comfortable and luxurious.  The handling and ride exceeded my expectations for a vehicle of this type, not to mention better than many sedans out there.  Even the stereo was top quality.  The dash plastics did look/feel a bit cheap, but the amenities you get make up for this easily.  The owner had put a complex bike/ski rack on the existing roof rack, but even this didn't cause it to be noisy inside.  Wind and road noise in this vehicle is less than in my 3 series BMW.  Oh, did I mention that, unlike the Explorer, this vehicle actually has brakes you can count on to stop you when you need the to be there.

If you are looking at the Grand Cherokee, Explorer, 4runner, Pathfinder, Mitsubishi, Rodeo, and all the competition out there, and you don't stop by your GMC (or Chevy and Oldsmobile) dealers to give this truck a serious look, you are making the same mistake many auto magazines seem to have made . . . You are overlooking a real winner . . . <br><br>
