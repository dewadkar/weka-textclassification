            I discovered this car about 8 months ago on the Internet. Prior to that I had only seen it once in real life and I went hunting for on until I caught up with one on auto-trader.com. I had also read about here on epinions. Well the SVX is better equipped than most 2001 cars. It's fast, it has 230 hp and it's very quiet. I notice a gentle sport like humming sound when I drive pin drop silence areas. It equipped with automatic climate control which accelerates to cool or heat up the car. It monitor the outside and inside temperature. Very smart, it would not blow cold air at your face on a cold morning. It waits on the water warms up them it gently blow. I choose it over a 2001 Toyota Celica.  Some how it very hard get bore from looking at this car. So futuristic, sources tell me that it was first made in 92 to compete with most top affordable cars back then ( like the Nissan 300zx, Mitsubishi 300 Gt. and even some Lexus). Although it a small car they manage to make enough leg and head room for the front passengers. They car is anything but small from the inside. It a four sitter, back sits for children and pets. Back sit folds down though to give more trunk space. With bright lights, built in spot lights and wipers this all wheel drive car it equipped for all weather. Avoid high water areas though as it a low profile car. It also featured in on the magazine of the 92 Road track edition.
Mine is equipped with leather seats, sun roof, CD, tape, fm, security, remote and speed sensitive steering ( all from the factory). It's just loaded and comfortable. I would recommend to most bachelors or new couples. Most of the emphases are on the ride. The slanted wind shield can take pebble, which usually bounces over. It feel tight when driving as a result it doesn't lean at sharp corners. Although the last was presented in 97 parts for this car are still being made ( check with your Subaru dealer). My Advice is to service regularly (like oil change and so on). Although not much need to be change, be sure to check that all the fluids are good condition. Take it to the Subaru mechanic for a checkup before you buy. For more inf. reader people opinion or check with the yahoo svx club.
Hope this gives you a picture...good luck on your hunt.
