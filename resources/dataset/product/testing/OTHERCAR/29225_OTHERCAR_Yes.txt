            This is not an opinion of an owner but rather my synopsis of a test drive on this vehicle for about 2 weeks. We rented this Lincoln for a vacation trip where we put approximately 2000 miles on it.
The Lincoln does not remind me of the Lincolns of old, No tuna boat this one. More like a smooth rocket. The fit and finish of the interior was supurb although I did notice that the right rear outer quarter panel exterior didn't match up well with the rear door.
The handling and power of this car is very nimble for a car of this size and is a pleasure to drive. The seats hold the body well and visibility is very good for a low profile vehicle.
I think the gauges could be improved upon however, you had to move your head around to see them all.
We did most of the driving on 2 lane country blacktop in a sparcly populated state. This car can cruise at 100 all day without making the driver feel edgy or out of control. 
I am considering the purchase of one of these but first I have to check out the Cadillacs.<br><br>
