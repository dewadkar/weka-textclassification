            I bought my Jetta GLS in Summer 1997 and it's proven to be quite a trooper -- I drive it EVERYWHERE, including several trips across the country. It's a workhorse! I've had NO operation problems (although my airbag light does pop on every so often only to go off again a week later and my cigarette lighter got stuck and fried the darn thing.) But nothing else -- I keep the car well-maintained and make sure to change oil every 3000 miles. But as far as comfort and reliability are concerned, it can't be beat. I've been rear-ended TWICE in this car and you can't see a SCRATCH. It's a tank. Just be sure to keep premium gas in it -- a friend with a Jetta didn't, and her car doesn't run nearly as smooth as mine. Once you get a Jetta, you can't go back. I won't... I'm already looking into new ones, although I must admit that the body style of the older ones is much more appealing that the new, more boxy shape.<br><br>
