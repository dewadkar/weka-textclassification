            I bought a 92 Daihatsu Charade 4 door, 5-speed sedan in 1999. This car was the latest model sold in the US. I paid
$1,400 for it. However, this is the best purchase I've ever made for a used car. The 1.3L engine is very smooth and quiet. The gas mileage is about 40 mpg on high way, 35 mpg 
for mixed driving! The best of this car is its reliability.
Ever since I owned it, I've put 22,000 miles on it in just one year. I've done a lot of long-distance driving (from North Carolina to Ohio, to DC, to Atalanta...) and local city driving as well. It NEVER ever gave me any trouble (isn't it better than some new cars? say Kia). Actually, credit should be given to the engine built by Toyota. FYI, Daihatsu is a Toyota company. So I shouldn't be too surprised of its immortality. Last Winter, my car had been buried in snow (I mean Chicago snow)for almost three months, then one day when I turned on the ignition, it started in sec. Until today, my Daihatsu is still running strong, I haven't changed anything yet besides 4 new tires. Too bad, Dahatsu disappeared in America after 92. They are much better cars than Geo Metros.
