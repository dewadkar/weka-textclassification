               We purchased our 95 GMC Suburban to replace our 3rd Suburban.  We have owned a &quot;79&quot;, &quot;84&quot;,&quot;88&quot; and &quot;95&quot; Suburban.  We keep our vehicles for a long time and have always purchased them used.  We live in Michigan and use our suburbans for all seasons.  We tow a four place snowmobile trailer and a 23 foot boat.  The 95 Suburban has done a wonderful job.  

   The mileage in not bad for being a 4 wheel drive and towing vehicle.  Avg. mileage is about 15 mpg.  I run with tires that have a 90 psi. pressure.  The high poundage in the tires makes for a rough ride but the mileage is worth it. 

   The 95 suburban has done everything I put it through.  The problem is it has been a money pit.  I purchased the extended warrenty.  Good thing.  I have had to replace the whole air cond. unit front to back(rear air and heat). I had to replace the drivers seat.  replace the ash tray(we don't smoke) and it still broke, the glove box has broken (not used much).  Seat belt replacement.  The list goes on.  I have replaced the wiring harness to the ignition. I had it in the shop because it would just shut down driving down the road.  This is our second and last GMC Suburban.

  We had two Chevy Suburbans.  They were great!!!  We had no problems with them.  I sold the 79 suburban with 175 thousand miles.  Bought it back 4 years later and drove it for a short time then sold it again.  No problems with that one.  The 84 Suburban was an excellent vehicle as well.  We were rear ended while stoped the Tarus was estemated travelling at 60mph never hit the brakes before hitting us.  Short story we drove away with the front seat tilted back a bit and a dent in the left rear quarter panel the size of a soft ball.  Not bad.  The Tarus, well every one was ok.  I would purchase another Chevy Suburban but I have owned my last GMC Suburban.<br><br>
