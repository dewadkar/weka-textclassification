            I've gone through about a dozen digital cameras over the last few years.  Everything from a top-of-the-line Mavica to some real junk. If you are primarily interested in getting medium resolution photos that are EASY to take, accurate, EASY to download--the Casio QV-10A is the camera for the job. So what is so good about this camera? It's easy to start to use--basically load the batteries, point and shoot.  Like most other digital cameras, you don't put your eye up to the camera (that STILL takes some getting used to&lt;sigh&gt;for old camera users) If you use it with bright light or the sun behind you--you won't be able to see the display screen at all. That can be extremely irritating. Putting it on a tripod can save you time if you are shooting a lot of items for sale or running a lot a friends or relatives in front of the camera--but in general, it's more trouble than its worth.  The camera is very lightweight--which is very nice. It is also decidedly for a RIGHTHANDER (I'm very lefthanded.) The lens assembly is on the left side of the camera and the entire left side of the camera can be rotated about 200ï¿½--if you think about that a second, yes you can turn the lens around and take a photo of yourself while you are watching the screen. I've had friends borrow the camera so they could use the camera to take their own photos. This feature works great if you are selling jewelry or clothes on one of the auction sites.  You can take closeups and see what it looks like.  It doesn't have a remote release/trigger--so you can't get more than arms length away.   Anyway, with the medium resolution, it can load to your computer QUICKLY.  If you are selling stuff on the internet, one lesson you will (or should) learn is that everyone wants to see a photo and they want it NOW--they don't want to wait for a minute or two for the photo to download. If Aunt Zeffie and Uncle Dufus want to see the kids--they want to see 'em quickly. Counting the number of hairs on the arm is Not critical to the<br><br>
