            We purchased a 94 concord back in 94 and thought it would be a good investment. It has been for the most part, but there are some things about the car that should be better quality. First of all, the transmissions are poorly built. We have had trouble with the trans from the start. It slips and grabs alot of the time. Also the paint on the trim has not lasted very well. It is beginning to flake off. The truck leaked badly when we first got it, we had to have the seal replaced. The plasic finish on some of the interior parts is starting to come off. The car has about 80,000 miles on it and has been reliable so far, but i would not recommend buying one.<br><br>
