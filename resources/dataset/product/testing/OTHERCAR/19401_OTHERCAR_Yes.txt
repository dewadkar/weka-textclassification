            My wife decided it was time for a more �substantial� vehicle than her Honda Civic coupe, since her morning commute often finds her sandwiched between larger Sport Utilities (SUV�s). If you can�t beat �em, join �em, so we were off to the dealerships. We definitely wanted one of the smaller scale SUV�s, since we like to park both vehicles in our garage, and we both aren�t thrilled at the prospect of parking one of those mammoths, or gassing up every few days. We just don�t need that kind of people mover. So, we kept to the smaller models, specifically the Toyota RAV4, Suzuki Grand Vitara, and the Honda CR-V. They all fit our size requirement, general price range, and had similar features.  The Honda CR-V however, turned out to have the best combination of style, gadgets and purpose, all at an attractive price. It didn�t hurt that our Civic had been an awesome ownership experience, it was the most trouble free car I�ve ever owned. So we ended up getting another Honda, settling on a silver EX model. The CR-V EX model�s best quality is that it�s packed with all kinds of features, and everything makes sense. Standard features included power everything, CD radio, keyless entry, cupholders everywhere, decent cargo room (more with the rear seats folded down), ABS brakes, alloy wheels including the full size spare, AND all-wheel-drive for just over $20,000. It also has the perfect ride height for my wife, letting her see over or around other traffic but doesn�t make her feel like she�s in a truck. It also serves as our four door sedan since I drive an Eclipse.

Getting in the CR-V, everything is laid out intuitively. Gauges are easy to see and well lit, The automatic transmission is column-mounted to allow the center area to be open for storage or to walk to the back. The cupholders are low and out of the way, and there�s even an accessory tray that �s hinged on the passenger seat to hide away when not needed. Interior room is generous for such a small vehicle, and the back seats fit two large adults very comfortably. There are armrests for the rear seats as well as one for the front driver�s seat. 

Outside, the CR-V is very sleek and well designed, with very sporty looks without too much utility. In my opinion it�s one of the best looking SUV�s on the road. The cargo door is split into a hatch back style glass, along with a station wagon-like door that opens to allow large cargo items. This setup works well, but due to the way the door opens long cargo items must stick out the back glass.  The cargo area�s built-in picnic table and ice well are a neat �show-and-tell� feature, but we have yet to use them. 

One of the benefits of having an all-wheel-drive vehicle is it�s ability to maintain traction in various weather conditions, and bad weather is no match for the CR-V�s all wheel drive system. I�ve gone so far as to make sudden swerves on rain soaked streets trying to upset the vehicle�s traction, but the CR-V really holds its ground. Gas mileage is adequate for an small all-wheel-drive SUV averaging around 21 mpg.  We haven�t gone �off-roading� in the CR-V yet, but I feel it�s up to the task of your average camping trip in the woods.

Our biggest complaint about the CR-V is its lack of power. An inline 4-cylinder engine is the only available powerplant for the CR-V, and spirited driving is only achieved through generous use of the gas pedal. The lack of power is worsened by the automatic transmission�s tendency to want to shift to higher gears quickly. I often find myself fighting with the transmission to maintain a particular gear for more than a few seconds. 

Overall, the CR-V has been a rewarding experience. Some may feel it�s too small to be a worthy SUV, but it fits our needs, our garage and our pocketbook just fine.

UPDATE- July 10,2000

After putting almost 7,000 miles on the odometer, our CR-V has been become our indespensible weekend warrior in addition to a daily driver. It's unbeliveable what items we've crammed in back once the rear seats are laid flat. Mountains of landscaping material, 10-ft. trees (with hatch window open), even a complete dinette set are just some of the cargo we've hauled in it. It's just amazing. The CR-V still drives as new, with our singular complaint continuing to be it's lack of top-end power. We've received no recalls to date, and haven't had a single item needing repair (Go Honda!). We've installed a few accessories including a passenger armrest and a rear cargo cover. Both require cutting and/or drilling, so you might consider having them installed by the dealer. One note about the cargo cover - the CR-V was clearly designed WITHOUT the cover in mind because the cover is tricky to install and does only a passable job of covering contents. It's not retractable either which makes it cumbersome to remove quickly.  

On the competitive front, Ford and Mazda have just this summer introduced small, CR-V sized SUVs with V6 engines. Had it been available, we would have considered it as an alternative. <br><br>
