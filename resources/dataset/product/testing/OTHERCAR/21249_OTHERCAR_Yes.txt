            My mother bought the 2000 Toyota Camry in November of 1999. We decided to stay with the Camry because it is so dependable and comfortable and a very smooth ride.  It is a very spacious car with a luxurious interior and gorgeous exterior.  
It is a bit smaller than the 1998 and 1999 but it's looks and driver handling are amazing.  There is practically no maintenance required and it gets GREAT gas mileage. It gets approx. 400 miles to the tank.  The car is so smooth that you really do not realize how fast you are going.
When you are driving the car you know that you are driving a very pretty car that is one of the top on the market.  Sitting in this vehicle looks like the interior of a BMW or any other expensive car.  It also drives like the other expensive cars on the market.
This is a great family car, and car for those who take long trips for pleasure or business.  <br><br>
