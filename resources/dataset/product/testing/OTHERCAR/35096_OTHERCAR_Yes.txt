When my neighbor started looking for a secondary vehicle she knew that she wanted something small, attractive looking and a vehicle that would get good gas mileage when she made her trips to Los Angeles to see her family.  She asked me to come with her when she started looking at used vehicles because, how can I say this politely, she has &#147<i>sucker</i>&#148 written all over her.  Before she made the purchase she labored over whether to buy something new or something used.  She already has a full sized SUV and a mini van and wanted something in the $5,000.00 - $7,000.00 range that she could pay in full rather than having to get a loan and make payments on.  

We hit the usual used car lots in our area but none of them had anything that appealed to her.  When we came across several Honda&#146s [CRX, Del Sol and Accords] she tested them out and eventually settled on the Del Sol.  We took it to an independent mechanic to have it looked over and he gave her the thumbs up but mentioned that timing belts and a few other minor things would need to be replaced within the next two thousand miles.  About a week later the paperwork was finalized after a little bit of last minute haggling and she ended up getting it for $5,300.00 plus title fee.  

<b>Honda Del Sol</b>

Looking like a cross between the old styled Pontiac Fiero&#146s and Honda CRX&#146s, the Del Sol is a quick little two seater that is sure to turn heads.  Often modified with V-Tech engines for street racing, these were last manufactured in 1997 and are quick to fly off the used car lot or from private owners.  As a word of warning, just because a car looks like it is in great shape doesn&#146t mean that it hasn&#146t been through a lot of abuse.  Take it to a garage or mechanic that you trust or better yet pay $50.00 and take it to an independent mechanic or &#147lemon check&#148 center where they will give you a complete listing of everything that might be wrong with the vehicle.  You can then haggle on price or pass on it all together.  The Del Sol&#146s strong point is that it is quick, looks sharp and provided that you keep up with the service, will last a long time.  Obviously this isn&#146t the type of vehicle that would be good for families unless you are looking for a commuter car or something that you&#146ll be driving alone.  My neighbor was looking for something that was smaller than her mini van and SUV, that she could use for errands, driving to Los Angeles by herself and wouldn&#146t cost an arm and a leg to purchase and get insurance for.  

<b>Interior</b>

Looking at the car you might not think that there is a lot of space inside but when you get in you really will be surprised at the amount of leg room for both the driver and passenger.  The seats are cloth however the car came with some very nice seat covers [I made her checkout the seats under the covers before she made the purchase to make sure they were in good shape and they looked almost new].  The floor mats were stock and ran from the under seat area to under the front console.

There are several storage compartments in the vehicle, one behind each of the seats and one between the seats behind the gearshift.  The ones behind the seats can be locked and are large enough to store CD&#146s, maps and small tools.  The downside is that there is only one central lock for both of them, which can be a real pain if you need to get something out while the car is moving.  The small storage area between the seats has room enough for pens, papers, change and other small items.  The glove compartment is small and rather dinky and won&#146t hold much more than a folded map, a few pans and a cellular phone.  If you are looking for cup holders you can find them [but have a lot of trouble using them] in the middle compartment built into the lid.  

<b>Stereo</b>

The Del Sol came with a stock stereo and cassette player that was soon scrapped and replaced with a six CD changer, Alpine faceplate and new speakers.  In regards to the stock radio, it worked perfectly but featured a cassette player that wasn&#146t really all that great and started to eat tapes and refuse to eject them.  The sliding security door was a really nice feature and when closed looked like it was part of the dash when you looked in from the outside.  Of course, if you don&#146t remember to close it, you are just asking for trouble.  Since there is a limited amount of room inside the vehicle speak placement is crucial to getting the most out of either the stock stereo or the after market system.  It&#146s best to leave the installation to a professional since you are working in some very cramped quarters.

<b>Security</b>

The car came with a standard kill switch lock down system that prevented the car from being started when the template / key switch is removed.  While this was a nice thing to have, it wouldn&#146t keep people from breaking in and stealing what was in the vehicle.  I suggested that since this has a sunroof and retractable rear window that she get a car alarm added to it when the stereo was being installed.  The kill switch is a nice thing to have on a vehicle but it won&#146t keep people from doing a &#147smash and grab&#148.  If you are looking at a vehicle that comes with a kill switch make sure that you get at least two templates and keep one of them in a safe place in case one gets damaged or becomes lost.  Also ask how difficult it will be to get a duplicate made in case the first one is damaged or lost &#150 you don&#146t want to be using the spare and have something happen to that.

<b>Handling</b>

I&#146ve driven this car in the dead of summer as well as during pretty bad rain storms and it handles nicely but since it is pretty low to the ground you have to take speed bumps slowly, be extremely careful on wet roads and don&#146t even bother to take it out when there are a few inches of snow on the roads.  This car has never seen snow but with the small clearance from the ground to the underbody, I can&#146t imagine it would do well.  The manual transmission gives you more power on the freeway and that could lead to some speeding tickets because this thing is pretty quick.  I drove it to Oceanside one weekend and had it up over 80 mph without even realizing it.  This thing is just plain fast!  Of course, this is the five speed, not the automatic which, from what I am told, doesn&#146t accelerate as well.

<b>Air Conditioning & Heating</b>

Since this is such a small car the air condition system feels like you are sitting in the arctic exhibit at the zoo after about five minutes.  This is a great thing to have during the summer months, especially when you are driving for an extended period of time.  The heating system is good but most times I find that when I drive this at night when the temperatures drop to about 40 degrees the windows will fog up on me.  I&#146m not alone in this since Jane, her sister and my brother have all experienced the same thing.  The defogger kicks in when you activate it but takes about four minutes to clear the front window.  You get the standard Honda knobs to select the heating or cooling system and level of power for each.  Vents are located in three sections, front right, front middle and front left and can be adjusted for comfort and maximum air circulation.

<b>Trunk Space</b>

Remember the title of this review?  <i>If Jennifer Lopez Was A Car &#150 She Would Be The Honda Del Sol</i> - that is a direct reference to the massive amount of trunk space that this car has.  If you ever heard the term &#145junk in the trunk&#146 in regards to the posterior of a female then you&#146ll get the joke.  Since the sunroof completely detaches you need a place to store it right?  The inner chamber of the trunk has several locking pins that the sunroof in placed in to.  Whatever you do, <i>please</i> make sure that the pins are not covered with dirt when you try to slide it in to place.  Read the instruction manual on how to properly place and seat the sunroof to avoid any accidents when you are driving [cracking it] or inserting or removing it.  The instrument panel will alert you if the sunroof isn&#146t seated properly so many sure you look at the panel to see if the light is illuminated or not.

<b>Mileage & Maintenance</b>

Ask any Honda owner what the key to vehicle longevity is and they will tell you that proper oil changes, time belt replacements and a little tender loving care is all that is needed to hold on to a vehicle for many years.  When my neighbor bought this it needed some service [timing belts and a pump] which cost about $250.00 total to have done.  I really felt that this should have been taken off the sale price since the maintenance was a few weeks [and a few hundred miles] overdue.  In any event, it only took a few hours to have done and was the only thing &#145major&#146 that needed taken care of.  I&#146ve been keeping tabs on the gas mileage and after going over the numbers I found that it gets about 22 miles in the city and 26 miles on the freeway.  Not that it makes much difference but freeway driving [for me] is at an average speed of about 70 miles per hour.  The tank seems to hold somewhere between ten and eleven gallons, not bad for a small sized car.  I&#146ve never filled it up when it was completely empty so I can&#146t be sure exactly how much gas it actually stores. 

<b>Complaints</b>

Since I drive this car frequently I really feel that I have enough hands on experience to say that the car isn&#146t perfect.  The biggest complaint that I have is the sunroof molding that leaks when it rains.  This can lead to damage to the interior, stereo system, speakers and leave you with one hell of a bad smell.  Since Southern California doesn&#146t get a lot of rain but rather a lot of rain at one time, this is something that most people might ignore.  Since the Del Sol is jet black it tends to absorb a lot of the heat from the summer sun, which might be why the molding cracks.  

<b>The Bottom Line</b>

If you are looking for a car that is good on gas, looks sweet and is relatively low maintenance, the Del Sol is definitely an option.  Your best bet is to try and find one of the later models ones that hasn&#146t been modified with a V-Tech engine since these have usually been beaten to hell and back in regards to the engine.  So far I haven&#146t had any trouble when I&#146ve been behind the wheel and when I asked my neighbor about it all I got was a huge smile.  If I were in the market for a small vehicle with a sporty design, I honestly think that the Del Sol would be at the top of the list.  Even though I am a tall person [almost six foot], I&#146ve never felt cramped behind the wheel or in the passenger seat &#150 and when I cam say that about a two seater &#150 that is saying a lot about the amount of room it has.  Considering that this is a 1996 model, it is in incredible shape inside and out.  No paint chips, marring, interior flaws or trouble with the power windows or door locks.  Besides all that &#133 it just looks sweet as hell!



As always, thanks for the visit!
