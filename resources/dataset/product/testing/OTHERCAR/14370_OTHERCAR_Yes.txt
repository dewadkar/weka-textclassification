            The Buick Riviera. By definition, a luxury car. But is it fun to drive? Only if you�re amused by trying to park 2 cars into a one-car garage. Then there�s the constant wondering of how many more gas stations shall I pass before I need to stop.

But it's the bold, but confident, nature of these beasts that I simply can�t get enough of. So, with an unusual amount of sadness, it's time to say good-bye to another veteran name. 

The last couple of years have not been kind to old names. Chrysler cut off production of the LeBaron and GM has axed the 98, the Skylark and will soon end production on the Riviera. 

The Riviera has long been a classic coupe. The name dates back to 1949 with the Roadmaster Riviera. Although Buick used the name throughout the '50s, it wasn't until 1963 that it became a different model.

In an age where virtually every name is of either some isolated place the vehicle will never travel, or some marketer�s blunder of the English language, it's almost unique to remember that they used to name their cars to give it a clear image. For the Riviera, it's a French vacation spot where the locals probably wouldn�t have even heard about it except for American travelers recognizing the names. 

The first Riviera was of GM styling-boss Bill Mitchell's finest designs. It had clean styling and perfect proportions that were widely copied back in the day, and still look incredibly modern today. The second generation was very much anticipated, and the third generation was a boat-tailed Riviera. I always liked looking at these Rivieras, as long as I didn't have to drive one.  

While the first Riviera ever produced used a 401 cubic-inch engine that pumped out 325-horsepower, the current model uses the 3.8-liter V-6, good for 240 horsepower through the front wheels. 

The throttle brings this beast to life and quickly propels this enormous Buick down the road. The steering is light, and so is brake effort, so be aware. But this is still  a Buick in the traditional sense. 

The Riviera has traction control and anti-lock brakes. Dual airbags come standard, along with auto headlamps. There's a CD player, CD storage area and even heated seats! This is great in winter. The chassis is ultra stiff, giving the car handling you wouldn't expect. It isn�t a sports sedan, but it will tackle corners without sending your passengers smashing into the door. 

Sitting in the front seats will make you feel quite small in the Riviera, with its large doors, rear window and a trunk big enough to carry a whole four-some to the first tee (a golf metaphor). I basically came up with this while driving the Riviera, �soft and wide�. The seats are soft and wide, and the ride is soft, and the car is wide. It made me feel as if my body should be soft and wide to drive the thing. But taking up as much interstate highway as possible is its mission. And it's about to set sail for the last time. 

It would be very easy to say that no one wants cars like this, but that just is <b>not </b> true. The Riviera was finding buyers, despite the lack of marketing. I personally know three people who have, or currently own a Riviera since 1998. But building three cars an hour won't win prizes with efficiency experts. 

Buick produced 2,000 1999 Rivieras to join the one million Rivieras produced since 1963. I�ve been told the final 200 will be named Riviera Silver Arrows, with your choice of color, as long as you like silver.  

The bottom line is, Buick needs sizzle. They used to sell over a million cars in 1985, but now it struggles to sell 450,000.
