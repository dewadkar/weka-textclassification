            Minivans have been unfairly maligned. There is a stigma that persists even though it has been proven time and time again that some minivans are actually pretty cool; most offer amenities and interior volume matched only by Packard Limousines of the 1940s. The Mazda MPV, Dodge Grand Caravan and Honda Odyssey are three vans that look appealing enough to choose based solely on exterior styling.

While most of the country utilizes minivans for their family hauling abilities, here in Southern California minivans are pressed into service for wide range of duties. Many windsurfers use minivans, so do hang-gliders, professional sales people, taxi services and flower shops in more urban areas. Stigma or not, minivans offer exactly what many SUV customer have been looking for &#150 car-like ride and handling with truck-like carrying capacity. 

So it&#146s no secret minivans in general are quite useful, but how does the Grand Caravan stack up against the others? The Dodge Caravan is available in a variety of styles: Caravan, extended length Grand Caravan, Grand Caravan AWD, mid-level Grand Caravan EX, Grand Caravan LXi and top-of-the-line Grand Caravan ES. The normal length Caravan is available with a 2.4-liter, 4-cylinder engine or a 180 hp 3.3-liter V6, while the Grand Caravan is available with that same 3.3-liter engine, or 3.8-liter V6. The vehicle tested here is the Grand Caravan ES front-wheel drive with the 3.8-liter V6 making 215 hp.

The stiffest competition for the Grand Caravan ES would seem to be the Odyssey EX, but the Dodge has a slight advantage on paper by offering a wider variety of engine/drive train configurations as well as both regular and extended wheel base versions. The Odyssey is offered with two trims LX or EX and they both come with the same 3.5-liter V6 making an impressive 240 hp. As stated previously, the Caravan offers two wheel base lengths, front-wheel drive, all-wheel drive and a choice of 3 engines.

Once inside the Caravan ES, the level of luxury is surprising to those of us who are not familiar with minivans. Comfy leather seating, white faced gauges, multi-CD changer mounted in-dash, great sounding stereo, dual power sliding side doors and a power rear door, power rear quarter windows and enough reading lights to rival a small passenger plane. This is no frumpy minivan; it has the look and feel of an all out luxury car. 

Luxurious as it is, the Grand also offers incredible utility. Behind the third row of seats is a convertible package tray. It swings up like a table and opens to reveal collapsible storage containers. The entire mechanism can be removed altogether in about 30 seconds and does not require tools. Seats can also be easily removed with the simple push and pull of 3 levers. The third row seats are easiest to remove as they come with four wheels to make storage, transport and re-installation easy &#150 they are also a good deal lighter than the middle row seats. In addition to being light, the third row seats have handles on the back. The second row seats are not difficult to remove, but they are not as easy as the third row seats. Middle row seats are a good deal heavier and have no handle to aid with removal/installation. The only thing lacking in the Grand Caravan with regard to rear passenger seating are second row seats that slide fore and aft. Some minivans offer this feature; the Grand Caravan does not.

The removable center console can be installed between the second row captain&#146s chairs or between the front seats. The console is deep and lighted and snaps in or out with amazing ease.

The interior overall is very well thought out and offers all the usefulness of a giant Swiss Army Knife on wheels. The Grand Caravan is able to carry any number of people/cargo combinations, all the while not sacrificing luxury.

On the road, the Grand Caravan maintains its luxury feel by offering a wonderfully quiet interior as well as a smooth, solid ride. The main drawback from behind the wheel is that its extended wheelbase can make maneuvering in small parking lots a bit of a hassle. But the advantages of all that space and the luxurious ride more than make up for the difficultly in parking lots. The 3.8-liter V6 provides adequate acceleration, and delivers the power in a smooth and linear fashion. Throttle response is nearly perfect with neither too little nor too much effort required to get the family wagon moving. In most driving situations, the big V6 remains rather placid, but there is bit of excess noise under hard acceleration. 

Handling in the Grand Caravan is leisurely at best. There is significant body roll and the Grand has a sort of heavy feeling all around. This is a big van &#150 these cars seem to have almost outgrown their &#147mini&#148 status, and handling suffers as a result. The Odyssey does seem to offer sportier handling, and a lighter feel without sacrificing ride quality. 

When pushed hard, the Grand Caravan plows forward with a good deal of under steer. Optional 215/60 tires on 17-inch rims do provide increased grip, but the Grand Caravan is simply not intended to compete at the local Autocross course. Still, handling is predictable in 95% of everyday driving situations and the Grand, like other minivan, feels much LESS likely to tip over than a full size SUV. This minivan really shines when lugging kids or cargo (or both) around town, and on the open highway. The Grand Caravan may suffer from the &#147soccer mom&#148 stigma, but it is the perfect road trip car. 

Overall, the 2003 Dodge Grand Caravan proves that Dodge is willing to settle for nothing less than perfection in the minivan class they invented almost 20 years ago. It&#146s no sports car, but that&#146s not the point of this top-notch family hauler. If you absolutely MUST have sporty handling &#150 get an Audi or BMW wagon. The Grand does some of its best work on long road-trips, but may be the perfect mall cruiser as well. For most people, most of the time, the Grand Caravan will prove to be an invaluable family companion.
