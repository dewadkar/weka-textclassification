            Well, I am back again writing another epinion on a VW model.  To exact it is a 1997 VW Passat GLX wagon.  While I am not the actual owner of the car (it is my mom who is the owner), I have spent a bit of time behind the wheel and feel that I know the car pretty well.  In fact, I took it on a small road trip (three hour drive each way).
   Anyway, to start out with the car is surprisingly large inside.  There is lots of room for almost anything you want to haul around.  I had no problem using this wagon to haul the various pieces of furniture that I recently bought at IKEA.  The car is also quite handsome.  It is not a sexy car, but it has German lines.  Meaning, it has a more angular than round look, which I am a big fan of.  The engine is the wonderful VR6.  This is quite a versatile engine.  It feels just as at home in the Passat as in my Corrado.  The car isn't a screamer, but it has some power and decent torque.  It is very quiet at highway speeds as well.  The seats are very comforable as well.  Reliablity has been great, although the car only has 29k miles.  As far as features are concerned, this car is loaded.  The only thing that it doesn't have is the CD changer.  All of the features work well except the heated seats, which I don't find to work very well.
    What I don't like about the car is the handling.  The steering is very soft, almost Cadillac-like.  I would like a bit more feeling in the steering.  I felt that the steering was much more precise in my non-power steering VW Fox.  The seats are not bolstered well either.  I am not a big person, but during some spirited driving, the bolsters don't keep me in the seats.  Finally, there is the suspension.  It is way too soft.  The settings give a soft ride, but there isn't enough damping.  It seems to float alot over dips in the road.  I wouldn't buy this car if you are into screaming around turns at high speed.
   However, I would buy the car if you want a relatively inexpensive, German automobile.  Again, much like the Corrado is for performance, the Passat is an unbeatable deal if you are looking for luxury.  <br><br>
