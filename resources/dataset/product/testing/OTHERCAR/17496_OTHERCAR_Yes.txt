            Bought this minivan almost 2 years ago.  I think it is a well designed vehicle.  Good use of interior space and a good ride overall.  Handles very nice.  No real mechanical problems and I have 35K miles on it.  I do not have the Grand Voyager, just the standard size but that's what I wanted.  The longer version seems bulky, "bus-like" and less attractive to me.  And mine still fits 7 people, just has less rear cargo space.

The van is roomy and comfortable.  Third row of seats folds down to allow for additional space.  But on my van, the second row does not fold down and that's a shame.  If it did, you could put longer items in the van without removing any seats.  The seats are on wheels which makes them MUCH easier to take out/put in, but the seats are still heavy.  

The sunscreen glass is a GREAT feature!  Not only does it make the van look much more sporty, but it keeps the kiddies from being "blinded by the light".....There is a defroster strip on the bottom 6 inches or so of the front windshield (inside the glass).  It helps keep your wipers clear from snow and ice.  This is really smart.   The dash is well laid out and all of the cruise buttons are on the steering wheel which I like.  The stereo sound is pretty good and with cassette, you can skip tracks like a CD.  I like most everything about it as far as looks and functionality.

I have noticed lately that my van is acquiring rattles and squeaks.  When I first bought it, the ride was impressively quiet.  But now, one of the sliding doors rattles over bumps and there are some other annoying squeaks.  The engine is louder too.  Maybe it just needs a new serpentine belt but when idling, it sounds sort of cheap if you know what I mean.
Also, when you have the main cupholder/tray pulled out from the dash, it rattles too.  Oh well.....

My van has the 3.0 V6.  It has decent power for normal driving but I was disappointed to see in the manual that it is only rated to haul 1000 pounds (if I am reading the manual's chart correctly).  I wanted to use it to haul a pop-up camper (if I buy one) and I worry about how the tranny would hold up.  I would check this out before you buy if you intend to haul.  You made need the 3.3 or 3.8 liter engine.

For the money, I think this van is a terrific value.  But I would never buy a brand new one.  They come down in price drastically after a couple years, and then you can buy one for a great price with low miles.

I bought mine in March, 2000 from a financial institution as it came off a 2-year lease with 20K miles and paid $12,500.
The same week, my co-worker bought a brand new 2000 model with almost identical options.  He paid $23,000.  As you all know, they don't change body styles or major mechanical components every year.  My van and my co-workers van look identical.  You cannot tell then apart from the inside or outside.  Keep this in mind when you are ready to buy.
