            We recently purchased our 1993 Plymouth Voyager, used of course, and would like this Epinion to reflect on how it looked and drove at this time and year (April 2001) so that I may help those of you who are in the market for a used minivan!

<b>The Basics</b>

It has 95,000 miles on it, and was purchased for $6500 at VanBoxtel Ford in Green Bay, WI.  It has a 3.0 L V-6 Engine, front wheel drive, and great gas mileage. A tank of gas usually costs around $20, but these days it costs around $25 a tank! 
It has front and rear window defrosting, air condition and heat, AM/FM Radio, manual windows, and our was also an Automatic.

<b>The Exterior</b>

Along with it's medium blue color, it has silver streaks that run horizontally along the bottom of the van and sports white and orange tail and head lights. It does not have the "box look" as some minivans do, but has a nice size look to it, much smaller than the newer ones out, but cute and comfy for our family!

<b>The Interior</b>

The interior contains the Driver and Passenger Seats, and then a second seat that seats 2 people, and then a third longer seat that holds 3 people easily. The seats are comfy and each comes with accessible seat belts.

The second and third seats can be taken out, with no problem at all, and also can be moved up, where the third seat can be locked into the second seat's position, leaving more room for storage in the back. Even with all the seats in and accounted for, there is still plenty enough room for luggage, pillows, blankets, etc..  Behind the last seat there is room, and also underneath the second and last seat is room to store things as well.

The driver and passenger seats both contain arm rests, along with the second seat, which is movable and removable for those who need to get to the third seat, or when you need to move large items into the back.

<b>The Extras or "Fun Stuff"</b>

We had never had a minivan before, so when we learned all of the fun and neat things this minivan held, we were more than excited to own it!

The Front Console: The speakers and AM/FM radio worked great, but the best part was the cup holder, which slides out of the console, and holds two medium size drinks securely, leaving you to drive easier without stumbling for your drink somewhere on the floor.  

The Passenger Seat: Not only does it recline with ease and comfort, but it also contains a compartment that opens and closes underneath the seat, great for maps and snacks that usually litter the vehicle otherwise.

The Inside Lights: No more trying to fidget with levers and knobs, with one push of the actually light, they turn on with ease, and are close to the front, so that while driving can be turned on and off without causing an accident!

Cup Holders and Compartments in the Back: Each seat in back has two cup holder and two compartments, great for those long trips to store the crayons, snacks, and small toys that can be lost quickly on long trips like those!

Built-in Car Seats for Children: Located in the second seat, these (2)car seats were great to discover, and set my mind at ease that I can easily transport my daughter or other smaller children if need be.

Automatic Locks: These were such a blessing to finally have, no more having to run around the car each time we got in or out- one click and the family is in, safe and sound!

<b>The Van Doors</b>

The two fronts doors open and close with ease, and the sliding door also worked with ease, closing securely each and every time. The sliding door also is provided with the Children's Safety Lock, which I reccomend each parent use!

The back hatch also opens with ease, and with one push of the button, you can open it when in Park, so no more trying to unlock it with your keys in a down pour! It WILL NOT open while driving, just so you don't freak out when accidentally pushing it on the highway or something! It also does NOT have a lever in back to just open it manually, you will have to unlock it every time you want to open it, if you choose not to use the convience of the button located right near the steering wheel.

<b>How Does It Drive?</b>

After we had our Transmission replaced, for free because we just had bought it, it works and drives beautifully! It accelerates nicely, and brakes great.  The brakes do tend to squeak now and then, but other than that, it has been great to us thus far.

I hope I have helped you decide on whether or not this minivan is for you, thanks for listening.
