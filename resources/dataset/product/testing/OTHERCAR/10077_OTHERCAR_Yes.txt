            Fun to drive, well-built, not too expensive. Despite being a &quot;small&quot; SUV, it has a roomy interior. Not a lot of exterior noise, but be prepared for a stiff ride ... after all, it is an SUV. Controls are well-placed and it seems as if this vehicle was designed by a driver. Only criticism relates to the seats. While they are comfortable, a lumbar adjustment would have been nice. First reaction to the seats while shopping was that they seemed &quot;cheap.&quot; It offers much of the Pathfinder genre without the price. As a 50-year old who has driven SUV's for years, this is a good one and compares to a Jeep I owned. Wouldn't go back to GM after the Xterra.Thanks, Nissan!<br><br>
