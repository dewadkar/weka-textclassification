            I have owned a Toyota for a while, and finally decided to go with a truck. This vehicle handles great. It is perfect for somebody who wants something sporty, but at the same time would like something that is useful. I have the V-6 and it has all the speed that I need. The TRD package is great. All you need to do is lock the rear differential and you can go offroading with the $WD's. Don't let the 2WD fool you, The 4WD's have the same gear ratio, so there is not too many places that the 4WD gets you that the 2WD can't either (Unless you are a serious offroader).  I love how the interior is so well but together. None of the controls are crammed together and they are all easy to find. I find this to be the case with most Toyota's. 

The vehicle is great to drive. The only complaint I have is the legroom in the back. It gets me out of driving when a group of friends and I go out. The extended cab is great for picking up groceries/other items. It is nice to be able to throw my mountain bike in the back and find a cool trail to ride.
