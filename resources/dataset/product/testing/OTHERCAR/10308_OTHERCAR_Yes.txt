            We bought an Altima after exhaustive shopping.  We chose it because it had a lot of benefits and still stayed within our budget.  After going to every car dealer in town and driving nearly everything on the lots that was within our price range, the Altima was the only logical choice.

Pros:  This car is very fun to drive.  It has a lot of &quot;get up and go&quot; and is very responsive.  It also has plenty of space to handle our baby seat.  For a mid-sized sedan, it is very spacious and comfortable.  We found nothing else that could compare to its space without getting to very expensive cars.  This is not an SUV, though, so don't expect that kind of space!  The Altima has been exceptionally dependable as well.  No major problems.

Cons:  The only real problem with it is it's few annoying noises.  Ever since we bought it, it has been squeaky going over bumps and it just is a little noisy.  Road noise can be a little loud, too.

Overall, I recommend it for anyone who is looking to buy a lot of sedan for a little money.<br><br>
