            This is my second Sony Mavica digital camera.  It has many improvements over the last generation, lighter, slimmer, quicker retake, easy disc slide-in, and effects options that make it fun and creative to use!  
It is so simple, yet the finished pictures are beautiful!  I take a lot of pictures for our auction pages and it's so easy to just pop in a disc, take a picture and pull the disc out, pop into your A drive and enter onto your host or auction site.  I am very pleased with it!<br><br>
