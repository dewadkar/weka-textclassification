            Well, I ordered my PT Cruiser 3/1 and finally picked it up 6/21. I absolutely love it!! Handles great and has plenty of power for me. I've never had a speeding ticket before, but probably will with this vehicle. Can't get over the way it corners. Only drawback is a paint problem(little white spots all over) that should be taken care of soon. Gas mileage is getting better every day..only have 650 mi on it so far. It does attract a lot of attention. Plan on extra time whenever you take it out, because people always stop you and want to see/talk about it. Keep the windex handy too for the inevitable nose prints on the windows when you return. Anyone who wants a multipurpose vehicle that stands out will appreciate the PT cruiser.
Okay, I keep forgetting that not everyone is a PT cruiser nut!! Sorry. The PT Cruiser is made by the Daimler Chrysler Corp. and is like nothing else on the market at this time. The styling reminds me of an old Ford sedan(i.e. the flared fender,the roofline, etc.)It is powered with a 2.4L,4 cylinder,16 valve,DOHC engine which has been used in other vehicles, but slightly reconfigured. There have been some complaints about it being sluggish, but I have not found this to be true. It is heavy for it's size(a little over 3100 lbs).I have had it up to 80 mph and the handling is excellent..holds the corners very well. After 650 miles, I am getting 21 mpg in town and 23mpg town/highway. Mileage continues to improve with breaking the engine in. Interior is roomy and comfortable.
I have been watching this vehicle since it was a concept car. I firmly believed that I would never buy a NEW vehicle again, but this one changed my mind. Ordered without having seen one in person(only pictures) or even test driving. I have not been disappointed by any means!! The biggest drawback now is the demand, which has created a lengthy waiting period between ordering and delivery. The wait is worth it!<br><br>
