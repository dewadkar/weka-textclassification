            This is late coming due to having been in the hospital and very ill, but I was graciously invited to a write-off in behalf of our late fellow epinionator, Roadiem.  And late or not, I was determined to participate because I remember Roadiem's reviews and greatly appreciated his knowledge as well as love for cars.

To his wife and family, I offer my deepest condolences and hope that the future will be a happy and comforting one with the fondness of his memory.  To Wolfman, thank you very much for the invitation because it is not only the first write off I have been invited to participate in, but one that I believe is truly meaningful which makes it double the importance in my opinion.

So, in memory of Roadiem, I offer this write up on my newly purchase Hyundai Accent.  Okay, it's not totally new, it's a 1998 model, but it has proven to be an immense blessing for my family and I.   It's a four-door model and while it is quite compact, it comfortably fits five adults.  I didn't particularly like the color red, but when I looked closely at it, it's more of a maroon color and I've grown to really appreciate it now.  

One of the nice features that I enjoy, on a very small scale, but nevertheless quite convenient, is the levers to open both the gas tank and the trunk.  The levers are right to the left of the driver's seat and so many times now, it has come in so handy as we unload groceries from the car.  No searching around the keys, etc.  The same for the gas tank which is pretty standard, I know, in more late model cars.

We've run all over town in this little dynamo and it gives pretty good power for a little car.  Compared to the Pontiac Grand Am that we owned prior to the Hyundai, it's comforting to know that this car isn't going to break down just when it feels like it.  We put enormous amounts of repair money into the Grand Am and still it would break down and leave us stranded so many times.  It was a real pleasure and relief to sell the Pontiac [to a mechanic] and purchase this Hyundai.

The only drawback that I've noticed thus far is that the Hyundai isn't as good on gas as the Pontiac was, which was quite amazing to me.  Still, with all the other pros about this car, I'm a much happier and content driver than before and, knock on wood, it hasn't broken down on us yet.  While it probably won't be our main car, as we are looking for a bigger family car, it's great to know that our Hyundai is at least dependable and moving.  [we also have a 1990 Mustang sitting in our carport, which isn't moving because it'll cost more to repair it than it would to buy another used car!]

So, in conclusion, even though I would prefer to buy an American car, I have found that the foreign cars are somewhat more dependable.  I hope that in the future that will change as I want to promote the purchase of American products, but for now, I admit, I'm happier with this little foreign car.

I dedicate and donate the funds from this review totally and completely to Roadiem.  God bless his family and thanks again for inviting me to participate in this write off.
