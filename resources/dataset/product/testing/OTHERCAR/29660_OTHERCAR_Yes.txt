            Interior: We own the town & country LXI version and it is a wonderful vehicle.  Comfortable, quiet and luxurious interior.  The seats remove easily and it only takes one person to take them out or put them back in.  The heated leather seats keep you warm in just the right places.  The in-dash 4 disk CD player is convenient and easy to use.

Exterior:  The ride is smooth and the engine is quiet compared the the Ford and Toyota competitors that we test drove before our purchase.  The automatic rear hatch we thought would be just a novelty but when you have your hands full (with a baby) it is really convenient.  My wife actually gets a lot of looks driving a minivan(very surprised). It's a very stylish/refined looking vehicle.

Quality: No problems and we don't expect any.  We are very happy with our decision.
