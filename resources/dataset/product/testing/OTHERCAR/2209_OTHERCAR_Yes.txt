            I love my 1998 Honda Prelude. I just paid it off and I am going to keep it. It rides the same today than it did on the day I bought it. My car has 32,000 miles and it is still fun to drive. The car comes loaded with many options like ABS, four wheel disk brakes, 16 rims (no hubcaps), awesome six speaker stereo with cd player, cruise control and a moon roof.

The trunk is a bit small and it is not easy getting in and out of the back seat, but once you are in there it is pretty comfortable for a sports car. The VTEC engine has a lot of power and it handles great. I notice this especially after I have been on a business trip and I have had to drive a rental. My car feels great after driving cars like the Ford Taurus and eve the Ford Mustang 8 cylinder. I am glad that I bought the Prelude instead of the Mustang.
