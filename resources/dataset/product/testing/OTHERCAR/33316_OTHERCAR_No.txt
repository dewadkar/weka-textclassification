            I should have known this car was going to be a problem, when I went to  buy it,none of the Foresters on the lot had the Forester decal on the side. In fact, they charged me for it when I took the car in for service the first time. 
I have owned 4 Subarus (spelled back wards = u r a bus). They have all been real work horses. One saved my sons life, because of its safety features.

This Forester has been a lemon. When the dealer called to ask how I liked it, after a week  or so, I started to tell him my problems and he said, "Oh, I have a call, I will call ya back". Ha. No call.

I had a burning smell and a rotation noise from the drive train, and 3 service visits later they could not locate it. Also, the car shakes when shifting into 2nd gear (automatic tran.) They told me, "They all do that".

They did replace the bearing in the rear wheel at 50K and charged me for it. Also, said something about the wrong grease from the factory and a boot that needs to be replaced. This bearing/boot/lube issue is something Foresters have and I believe that Subaru needs to do a recall!

Air cond. stopped at 30K Big $$ again.

Rear door/hatch rattles. Gets lubed, rattles again in 200 more miles.

My two other cars are a Mercedes-Benz SLK and an Audi A-6. I must say they are all better than the Jeep that I traded in on the Subaru.

Go OUTBACK, not FORESTER.
