            As of this writing, I have had <b>1988 Volvo 740GLE</b> for almost 4 years. The car has 160K on the odometer. Although 2 years ago I got a new car, I still keep Volvo and like it a lot. The old cars seem to have personality that some newer ones lack...

<b>Reliability</b>

I have heard a lot that Volvo cars are very reliable (at least comparing to the domestic cars). However, in my case the reliability has been very disappointing! <b>Which is no indication that all 1988 Volvo 740GLE will have the same issues.</b>

<b>Transmission</b>

I had to replace the transmission <b>three</b> times (with used ones, a new transmission would cost a fortune). Every time I would talk to different mechanics about Volvo&#146s troubled transmission, they all would be very surprised. They say that &#147Transmission on Volvos never break&#148.

Last time (a year and a half ago) I also replaced a radiator - the coolant was leaking inside transmission, and (knocking on the wood) it seems to cure transmission problems. Since then, the transmission worked fine (before that, it died every 6 months or 6,000 miles, whichever comes first).

<b>Other Stuff</b>

In addition to transmissions, I had to replace the battery, rear brake rotors (front to follow) and all pads, AC refrigerant, AC compressor, water pump, drive belts and fuel injectors (not counting oil changes, replacement set of tires, timing belt and fuel injectors cleaning). 

I had difficulties starting the engine &#150 had to press accelerator pedal to make engine start and after that it used to run erratically for a while - replacing of the distributor cap cured this &#150 the contacts were bad. 

Brakes are discs all around and are, although difficult to modulate, very effective. The acceleration used to be adequate even taking into account 114 hp 2.3-litre 4-cylinder engine and automatic transmission. Probably because of relatively fat torque curve with maximum at 2750 rpm. 

Recently, there&#146s been a lot of engine knocking and acceleration got slow. It was cured by the &#147STP Complete Fuel System Cleaner&#148, bought at Target for 7 bucks. I am starting to hear knocking again. Time to go to Target &#150 this time I will try some milder cleaner.

The insurance premium is low and the crush tests show that the car is very safe, even though it does not have any airbags. The ride is a bit harsh - the suspension is stiff (probably because the struts are dead), but I like it &#150 the body roll is minimal. 


There are no signs of corrosion (well, it's California). I have occasional electric problems. Some of them may be resolved by slight movement of the key (the contacts are not good). The stereo is good (Radio/Cassette) and noise level in the cabin is low (but engine is noisy). The trunk is huge and there is a ski pass-through. 

The power moonroof is leaking in the rain, also once I was unable to close it after opening, so when I got home I had to open the lid of the mechanism and push a couple of mechanical parts, after which it works fine (good thing - the procedure was described in the manual). 

<b>Seats</b>

The seats are very comfortable and easily adjusted. Comparing to the <b><a href="/content_57931697796">2000 Mitsubishi Galant</a></b>, the Volvo&#146s seats are a godsend. I could spend hours in them easily, whereas in Mitsu I start feeling uncomfortable after about one hour.

<b>Safety</b>

If you go to crashtest.com, you will see that 1988 Volvo 740 is one of the safest cars of all times. The car feels solid and also has good active safety: very effective disc brakes and good rearward visibility.

Due to better seats and visibility, I feel much more relaxed driving my 740, comparing to my Galant. The Volvo also has better directional stability on the freeway and rear-wheel drive gives it really small turning radius (which I appreciate when it is time to make a U-turn) and less understeer.

<b>Smog Test</b>

Last time, I had to take a smog test at the so-called &#147Test-Only Station&#148. Here, in California, the smog test standards are probably the toughest, yet the car passed the test without need for any modifications.

<b>Conclusion</b>

<i>The car is good as a first car for short distance driving - safe, low insurance, easy to drive, good braking. But reliability at that age (13 years) has been quite poor. 

However, the amount of money I spend to keep the car moving is less than spending on the new car. Previous owner didn't have any problems and my experience with 740&#146s reliability is no indication that all cars of the same model have the same issues.</i>
 
<b>Advise</b>

I got advise from Volvo enthusiasts and find it very useful:

1. Use good gas, preferably 91 octane. Although the manual states the car will run on 89, the old cars might like premium gas better. And the car definitely likes Chevron and Mobil much more than Arco.

2. Drive fast, at least once in a while. It is a good practice for any old car to drive once a week or two on the freeway at 75-80 mph.

3. With first signs of engine knocking, do injector cleaning. The professional injector cleaning is preferred, however I found that the &#147STP Complete Fuel System Cleaner&#148 works well too. Keep in mind that cheap (less than $2) substances often don&#146t do much. Between &#147complete&#148 fuel system cleanings you can perform the fuel injector cleaning using less costly (about $3) substances. Make sure they clean the injectors, not just &#147help keep injectors clean with regular use&#148.

4. If you get an old Volvo and not sure if previous owner changed the transmission fluid regularly, <b>DO NOT CHANGE THE TRANSMISSION FLUID</b> - the new fluid will ruin it. I didn&#146t believe it, but then I found this advice online from the auto mechanic. Also, I changed the fluid in the used transmission I got once and after that it died in two days.

5. If the transmission refuses to shift into the 4th gear, the &#147overdrive off&#148 indicator illuminates and the &#147overdrive on/off&#148 button on the shifter doesn&#146t help, you probably have a problem with an overdrive relay, located in the center console. I had to slap on the side of the console to get into the 4th gear. It is easy to replace.

6. <b>Most important: I found out the hard way that the transmission after transmission may fail if there is a leak of coolant in the transmission fluid. The problem might be a hole in the radiator, not transmission itself.</b>
