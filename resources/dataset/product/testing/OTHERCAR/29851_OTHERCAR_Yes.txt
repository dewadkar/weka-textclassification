            I recently had the opportunity to drive a 2004 Acura TSX. The car was pearl white with parchment interior. It had the 5 speed Sequential SportShift "automanual" transmission and the navigation system with voice recognition. Everything else on the car (a prodigious list of features) is standard.

For those of us with Fantasy Football teams, we are always looking for the "sleeper". That player who can be had very cheap and who will perform well beyond your expectations. The sleeper may not be flashy, he may not be the highest performance player out there, but he gets the job done as well or better than anyone else and doesn't break the bank.  

Enter the Acura TSX. None of us may ever understand why Acura has decided to name its cars with meaningless acronyms, but aside from the ridiculous name, this car should appeal to just about anyone out there who is looking for an entry level luxury sport sedan. I admit, I read the articles in the automotive press about the TSX and was puzzled. I digested the ravings about what a great little car this was and became intrigued. How could anyone appreciate a car that cost $29,000 and only had a 4 cylinder engine? I quickly found out.

To begin with, the styling of the exterior of this car, while conservative in typical Acura fashion, is actually unique (in a good way) and slightly muscular. It is angular, and the abrupt, chopped off look of the back of the car adds to its wedge like, sporting shape. This car is not going to blow anyone's doors off sitting still like a Modena, but for a small 4 door sedan, it is attractive. The car comes standard with 17 inch wheels which do a decent job of filling the wheel wells, however, I think the car looks significantly better with the simple addition of 18 inch wheels (the dealer had one on the lot and it looked great). Acura should consider offering a sports package for this car (larger rims, more aggressive suspension settings...a Type S perhaps?).

The interior of this car is where it really stands out. The overall design is a stylish and modern, with nice touches of fake wood or fake aluminum that highlight the high quality perforated leather and other soft touch surfaces that swaddle the occupants of this vehicle. Virtually no hard plastic surfaces can be found throughout, and the operation of the switchgear and storage doors is commendably smooth and lends an overall feeling of luxury. This is something that Honda/Acura does better than any of their Japanese competitors even in their most inexpensive cars. The quality of materials and fit and finish of interiors are just hands down better than any Nissan, Toyota, Mitsubishi, or even Infiniti. The interior of the TSX also sports an impressive navigation system should one opt for it. Since I drove a navigation equipped vehicle, I must say that I was very impressed by how well the enormous (8") navigation screen was integrated into the vehicle's interior design. It is incorporated so well that I would even venture to say that it is the central theme of the interior. The car just doesn't look the same without it. Many of the vehicle's controls are operated through the navigation system (a/c, stereo, etc.), and it is simple and intuitive to use. In addition, the navigation system is voice activated for those who don't want to take their eyes too far off the road to use it. The problem with the voice recognition is that it doesn't adapt to new voices well and it is really (in my humble opinion) a worthless gimmick. However, were I to buy a TSX, I would not buy one without the navigation, and I am not even a fan of navigation systems. It's that good. Another nice feature of the TSX interior is that Acura decided to get with the program and move some frequently used controls (cruise, stereo volume, etc.) to the attractive, three spoke leather steering wheel. In keeping with the upscale feel of the rest of the interior, these soft touch buttons worked flawlessly and are a convenience for those of us who have even gotten too lazy to simply reach over and adjust the volume via a knob. The interior is loaded with all the features you would expect of more costly vehicles, including an in dash 6 disc changer linked to an incredible 360 watt stereo and powerful dual zone climate control. The back seat is definately not a place for anyone over 5'9". It is comfortable, but does not have a lot of leg or headroom. I would say it has more than the 3 Series or A4 but certainly less than a Maxima. The car does have a surprisingly large trunk, and its hinges do not collapse into the trunk space. Overall, the quality and features of the interior of this car are downright impressive, easily surpassing everything in this class with the exception of the Audi A4 which costs at least $5,000 more if you want the same level of performance (a 4 cylinder A4 could not keep up with the TSX unless the TSX was driving in reverse). 
 
Now for the fun part of every review. Taking this car out for a spin, I was immediately struck by the amount of torque the 2.4 liter 4 cylinder put out. The Hondas/Acuras I have driven in the past have suffered from a dearth of low end torque but this was not the case with the TSX. Satisfactory amounts of torque were on tap from the get go, even with the automatic transmission, and the delivery was pretty linear throughout the engine's powerband. This car is surprisingly quick. If one needs more convincing, an automotive enthusiasts' publication recently noted that the TSX was less than half a second slower than a V6 Audi A4 in the quarter mile. Now, the Audi is certainly not what I would call fleet of foot for a car with a 3 liter V6, but the TSX is a pleasant surprise given its displacement handicap. Another pleasant surprise was the 5 speed Sequential SportShift automanual transmission. It executed crisp and smooth up and downshifts regardless as to the vehicle's speed and worked very well even in the automatic mode. With a 4 cylinder car, the ability to shift by onesself is essential and this transmission is a joy to use in the manual mode. Once up to speed on the freeway, the TSX is very quiet and Acura has done a remarkable job of insulating the cabin from wind, road and engine noise and vibration, even at fairly ridiculous engine speeds (i.e., 6,200 rpm). The end result is that one ends up driving this car faster than one thinks very frequently and 85 mph on the freeway really seems like nothing. I literally looked down at one point during a 3rd to 5th gear acceleration test on the freeway and noticed that I had hit 100 mph without being alerted by the rush of wind noise or the engine screaming one might expect. For commuters, this car would be a great place to spend one's time. Around town the car handles well, with minimal body roll. The suspension soaks up bumps and broken pavement well without any loud thumps or cabin rattles. The only complaint I have in the handling department is a function of this being a front wheel drive vehicle and the fact that at the limit, the car will just push its front end (a condition known as "understeer"). Supposedly this is safer than the alternative, however, I have never understood why trying to figure out why one is sliding straight into something when the wheel is turned is safer than being able to control the back end of a vehicle with the throttle as well as the brakes and steering wheel...but I digress. The majority of drivers feel safer with a car that pushes at the limit. Overall, the TSX is really a nice car to drive and for those individuals out there whose primary concern is not 0-60 time or hairpin turns, this vehicle can even be fun. 

Currently, Acura is not dealing on the TSX because it is a new release and they can't even get enough of them to the dealer showrooms. However, I am inclined to believe that some pricing flexibility is probably in the works in the near future when the new TL arrives (currently expected in early October). Bottom line: if you are looking for an entry level luxury sports sedan, you can't do any better for less than $30 grand.
