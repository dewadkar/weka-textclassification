The Subaru Legacy Wagon, The predecessor to the &quot;Outback&quot; has served my family for 3 years. I originally purchased it when our family grew beyond the front seat of my Dodge Dakota pickup truck. With all wheel drive it is a great vehicle to have in the Northeast and North where snow and rain can ruin your Sunday drives. The Automatic Transmission is excellent and adjusts to all driving conditions without complaint.
When you start to look at All wheel drive vehicles do not expect outstanding fuel economy. We have found our Subaru get about 22 miles per gallon pretty much like clock work. The engine arrangement is a little different than your common V engines or Inline engines this is a Horizontal engines with a center crankcase and pistons firing horizontal. This allows a relatively compact engine with a perky response.  Some other options that this beauty has is a ride height adjustment for those of us in the colder climates where snow is a definite possibility. This feature uses air adjustable shocks to raise the chassis 3 inches off the ground to help in ground clearance when there is a lot of white stuff on the ground.  However don't use this while on the highway because you want to be higher than all the other commuters. Because the higher you are the more sail area you present to cross winds and the worse your fuel economy will end up being.
The only drawback that we found with our Subaru was the room. We have another little one on the way and even the Subaru will be a little cramped so we are on the way to purchase a Mini Van. It will be hard to find a Van in this class with the features that the Subaru had but hey that's what shopping is all about.<br><br>
