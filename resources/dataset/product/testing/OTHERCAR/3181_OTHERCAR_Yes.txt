            Ever since I was very little, I have always been in love with the third generation (1982-1992) Camaro.  As a child, it was an awesome thing to behold and now as an adult it is even more awesome because now I can appreciate more about this car than just it's sexy looks. 

The comfort is not what you'd expect from a sports car...it's better.  The seating position is low (as it should be in a sports car) and the seats themselves are very comfortable even for hours on end.  My friend and I recently took a trip to the Florida Keys (about 1,000 miles total) and, for the whole trip, nary a complaint of discomfort did either of us utter.  I am referring only to the front seats of course; the rear seats certainly offer no joy for the average sized adult human being.  Many call the rear seats useless, but such a claim is unfair and actually very incorrect; the rear seats flip down and are contoured in such a way that they form a small pocket when they are down.  This actually makes the rear seats quite useful for storing things that you do not want blowing around the cockpit when the windows are down, such as loose papers or the like, and things that you want to protect from the intense heat and rays of the mid-day sun.  In addition, when in their down position, the rear seats form somewhat of a flat platform which is an ideal place to put large objects, such as a cooler, that you may want easy access to during a long trip.

Reliability for this car is also quite good.  In the 51,000 miles that I have owned this car, I have had very few problems; all problems that I have had have been inexpensive and easy enough to remedy without the intervention of a professional mechanic and without any exotic tools.  So far, aside from brake pads, tires, and other normal wear items, I have had to replace the radiator ($100), the alternator ($80), the starter motor ($50), the water pump ($30), and the distributor cap and rotor ($14).  The only other item that I have had to repair is the Vehicle Anti-Theft System (aka VATS).  The ignition key for the car (on all Camaros built after and including 1986) has a small resistor on it that the VATS reads.  If, for some reason, the VATS does not read the correct amount of ohms from the resistor in the key, then it will not allow the starter motor to engage, the injectors to pulse, or the spark plugs to fire.  This prevents thieves from simply hot-wiring your car and driving it away, however when it malfunctions it also prevents YOU from DRIVING your car!  Sometimes this is caused by dirt on the resistor, but for me this was not the case.  I remedied this condition by installing a VATS bypass kit ($25) from Eckler's (Corvettes also use the VATS).  Currently, my Camaro has ~125,000 miles showing on the odometer and it runs just as well as the day I drove it home for the first time.

It is not a slow car, however my Camaro is not really very fast either because it is equipped with the 305cid (5.0 liter) V8 motor.  Despite its intimidating V8 growl, this motor is actually pretty disappointing and does not perform nearly at the level that you would hope that an eight cylinder engine would.  Keep in mind though that this is the 305cid motor that I am referring to; the 350cid (5.7 liter) motor, that was offered as an option on Camaros from 1987-1992, is not quite so anemic.  Unfortunately though, the 350cid powerplant was available for neither the convertible nor the T-topped models.  This 350cid engine was also never available with a manual transmission.

Wet weather traction is almost an oxymoron.  On two rainy occasions I have been surprised to find myself staring back at the way I had just come from when attempting to make a rather mild 25mph turn.  When the roads are wet, it's best to be very ginger with the throttle from a stop or else the car could very quickly start to point in a less than desirable direction.

The brakes are not of the anti-lock variety...nor are they of the 'good' variety.  In fact they are not of even the mediocre variety!  The brakes are sluggish and soft and can really leave you in a difficult situation if you're careless (and who isn't from time to time?).  If I had to pick out the most un-sporting feature of this car, it would, without a doubt, be the brakes.

This is a big car!  The positive side of this is that there is plenty of room on the inside, however as far as sports cars go, the Camaro is a big heavy beast.  Maneuvering in tight places can sometimes be difficult.  Parallel parking, which I'll admit I'm not very good at to begin with, and narrow roads can sometimes make for a rather nervous experience.  The weight and sheer size of the car also make it less than ideal for tight cornering.  The worst part is the weight of the car tends to exaggerate all of the above complaints.
