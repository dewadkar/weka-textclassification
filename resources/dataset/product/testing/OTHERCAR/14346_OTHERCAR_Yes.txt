            I've owned my 2000 Altima SE for a year and a half now and would like to add my two cents to the mix.
Pros: As usual for Japanese cars, the fit and finish is far superior to their American counterparts. Tolerances are exacting and overall build quality is excellent. 
The car handles well for a front wheel drive sedan and offers quick acceleration for a four cylinder engine. 
Interior room is spacious and the seats are firm and fairly comfortable. Instrumentation is simple and functional. Fuel economy is very good for the class, about 27 MPG daily driving, while long trips yield 30 MPG at 65 MPH.
Cons: Dull design as usual for Nissan. It's hard to believe the car company that brought us the 240Z is the same company that designed the boring "cookie cutter" look of the Altima and Sentra.
The resale value of the car is terrible. A car I paid $20,000 for in December of 1999 is worth about $13,000 now. I guess that's due to the lease companies flooding the market with Altimas. 
Conclusion: I'm the kind of person who buys a new car every two years and frankly I can't wait until my two years are up. Though there is nothing specific I can point to for this reasoning, I find the car about as exciting as watching grass grow. It does most things well, but it does nothing exceptional.
