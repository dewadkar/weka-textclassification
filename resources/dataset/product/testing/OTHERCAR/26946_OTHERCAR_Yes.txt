            I own a Camry LE, 1998.  This was probably one of the best buys carwise anyone could hope to make.  It's worth its weight in gold basically.  Save for a trip to mechanics to fix a headlight, I haven't had any problems with this car.  It's still like I drove it off the lot.  
It's not a compact car really, but it's cozy with enough room even for taller people like myself to amble in and out of.  It handles like a dream, no shakes or rattles to make you nervous, it accelerates quickly and stops on a dime.  Not only does it run well, it looks very sleek and spiffy.  A total babe magnet.  
Even the creature comforts are nice, six cd changer, immediate and effective AC and Heat, excellent sound system, cruise control.   
Obviously you wouldn't try and fit a large family in this car on a long road trip, but it's comfortable even when driving around a few people for several hours.  Or when you're cruising around to find other people to ride with you.
But seriously, this car is well worth every penny, both aesthetically and in performance.<br><br>
