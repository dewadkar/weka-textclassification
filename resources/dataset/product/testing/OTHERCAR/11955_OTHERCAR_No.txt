            I bought my 2002 Tacoma Prerunner Extra Cab V6 in June 2002.  In the first 3 months it was in the dealers 8 times to fix various squeaks and rattles, and has been in three more times since then.  The steering wheel had sharp plastic edges and the had to be replaced.  The horn did not work.  The A/C is not capable of cooling the cab on a hot day.  There were many rattles inside the dash and it has been taken out 3 times to fix the rattles.  The bolts that hold the cab to the frame were loose and had to be re-tightened.  The first mechanic the dealership had working on the rattles was hard of hearing and couldn't identify the rattles.  I am also disappointed in the seat comfort.  My RAV4 has better seats.  The dash layout is poor.  The driver can't see the clock.
