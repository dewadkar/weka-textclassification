            My first vehicle was a 1992 Plymouth Sundance America, given to me in 1997 by my parents shortly before I got my driver's license.  My mom had purchased it new, and turned it over to me when it had 84,000 miles on it.
This car was a dream for my driver's test, small, compact, and EASY to parallel park.  

It was cheap on gas, and got me where I needed to go.  The 4-cylinder, 2.2 liter engine was slow on the uptake, but for getting me around town, to work and school and back, it was great.  It was known to rattle and shake a bit at higher speeds.  It was a bit tight for hauling friends around in, but not nearly as bad as a compact hatchback along the lines of the Colt.  It only needed new brakes while I owned the car, and my mom never had a major problem with it beforehand.  The body was in ok shape, but it was a white car and it was starting to rust.  I'm sure salt and sand and being kept out in the winter had a lot to do with this.

My poor Sundance's final moment was in January of 1998 when, as I was on my way to school the day after a storm, it spun around and slammed into a tree.  The car was totaled, but it did its job - it saved me from serious harm.  Thankfully, this model was equipped with an airbag.  For an older-model car you can't do much better than the Sundance, an affordable compact car with important safety features.<br><br>
