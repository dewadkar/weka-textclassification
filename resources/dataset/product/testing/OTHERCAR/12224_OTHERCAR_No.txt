            I have owned my GMC Savana for 24 months and have logged 58,000 miles.  Though it has been very reliable, it is not without it's problems.  I had traded a Dodge Van similar to this with over 120,000 miles.  Within 3 days the new GMC had more rattles than the older Dodge.  The interior leaves much to be desired.  All panels have been removed and re-installed with new clips.  They still keep falling off.  The ceiling panels fell to the foor within the first 2,000 miles.  To date even though the dealer has been most co-operative, he has not been able to resolve the problems.

On the brighter side, it rides very well, hauls passengers and loads with ease, (350 cu. in. engine), and is quite attractive.  Seats remove easily.  The gas mileage leaves a bit to be desired, but is in the range of any of the 5 previous vans I have owned, and driven a total of 700,000 miles.  Brakes are good, stopping distance not bad, and overall performance is OK.

Would I purchase another like this?  Probably not.  The poor interior has made this a disappointment even though most everything else has been acceptable.  Of the 5 previous vans I have owned, 3 were GMC, but this is one of the most problem ones.<br><br>
