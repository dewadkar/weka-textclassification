            My husband and I bought the car after our Ford Bronco died back in Dec. 1998.  At that time, the Sable 4 dr Sedan was only 5 years old.  Over the past 1 1/2 years, we have had to replace the transmission, head gaskets, and oil pan, to a tune of $3,000+.  In addition, the engine and air bag light flicker on and off continuously.  I contacted Ford to inquire as to why the 1994 Sable had been recalled for blown head gaskets, but the 1993 Sable, which is the same engine, has not been.  They attempted an explanation, but it didn't make sense to me at the time, it still doesn't.  Something about the age of my car and the date of the occurrence is outside of a warranty period.  The bottom line, they refuse to reimburse owners of 1993 Sables who have problems.  Visits to the NHTSA website reveal numerous other 1993 Sable owners who experience increasing problems with their automobiles. <br><br>
