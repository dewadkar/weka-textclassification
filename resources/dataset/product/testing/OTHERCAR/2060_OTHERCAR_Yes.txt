            I have been wanting my own digital camera for quite some time.  My family had a JoyCam digital camara, but the quality on that was so low that it was not worth it to take pictures.  Plus, I went to college and it stayed with them in a different state.  So, for my birthday in December, I requested a digital camera.

I didn't want anything extravagant, just an affordable camera that took good-quality, pictures I could upload to my homepage (http://www.neeterskeeter.com :))  That is exactly what I got with this camera. My dad got it for me from a local department store with a rebate, so it only cost $99. I have had the camera for a few weeks now, and I think it is a great one.  This camera is so small and cute; it is pocket-sized so it's easy to take it anywhere and not have it be a big hastle.  It can hold 16 high quality pictures or 32 lower-quality ones (Although I have not been able to see much of a difference in quality, both of them are very clear.)  It uploads quickly via USB, and the software that comes with it is helpful and fun.  The camera is easy to use; its buttons can be figured out right away, and just in case you need help, the instructions are very helpful.

I have one nitpicky complaint about this camera, and that is that you have to wait seven seconds in between snapping pictures.  That is not usually a big deal for me, because I am not extremely impatient, nor am I a professional photographer who has to click a whole bunch of different pictures after one another. :)  So I feel that for the average person this is not a big complaint, but if you plan to take lots of pictures in a row, I just wanted to mention that with this camera you can't do that because it pauses for 7 seconds after taking each picture to process it, and you can't take another picture until those 7 seconds are over.

If you are looking for a *great* digital camera on a limited budget, I definitely recommend this one.  It has met all my needs for my webpage and has also been a fun toy to play with as well. :)   It will provide lots of fun at your family and friend gatherings.  I love not having to buy film and wait for it to be developed, but instead being able to take pictures and have them within minutes on my computer anytime I want.  This camera has served those needs very easily, and I have a feeling it will continue to do so for a long time.<br><br>
