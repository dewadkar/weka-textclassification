            We recently bought the Town & Country EX, and could not be happier.  After much research, I felt that this was the best value.

Don't waste your time with the Mazda, Chevy, or the Ford minivans.  You may want to look a the Toyota.  You definitely should take a look at the Honda.

The Honda minivan has been getting rave reviews, and it does have some nice features: the rear seats fold flat and the 2002 powertrain is fast.  However, the Town and Country isn't a substandard minivan, and stands up very well to its #1 rival. 

Perhaps the best reason to own a Honda is the reliability factor.  I have a feeling that is the main reason why people stick to Honda and ignore the Chrysler.  However, things are changing.  After being bought out by Mercedez-Benz, priorities have been changed a little bit at Chrysler.  It's all about money, but they finally figured out that building a reliable automobile saves money in the long run, as warranty costs add up quickly.  They have made some drastic changes in their processes and purchasing of parts, and this is making a difference.  A bit problem in the past was the transmission, which was apparently attributed to a faulty supplier.  Recently, they announced a 19% decrease in warranty problems.  In addition, they are now backing their engine and powertrain for 7 years/70,000 miles to back up their claim that they are more reliable.  This is something I don't think they would do if they thought it would hurt their wallet down the road.  They must be confident about their product.  Note that the latest reliability study by JD powers states (per USA today May 31 2002):

"The latest J.D. Power and Associates study of new-car quality shows all three Detroit automakers bumping up against perennial leaders Toyota and Honda.  It was the Americans' best showing in the 16 years of the study. In fact, General Motors ranked third, the first time a U.S. automaker has been that high. DaimlerChrysler was fourth, Ford Motor fifth."


I have to say that so far I have been impressed.  The minivan feels like quality.  Just close the driver or passenger door, and you will know what I am talking about.  In the past, American cars felt cheap...but not the imports.  The current model feels like an import.  For example, the "thud" you'll hear when you close the door is what I used to feel with imports in the past.   

So the reason to buy a Chrysler seems to get better.  On top of that, who would want to pay MSRP or more on a car?  That is what is currently going on with the Honda minivan, and I absolutely refuse to pay full sticker on a car.  That is ridiculous.  It's even more ridiculous when you realize you can buy a Town and Country with the TV/VCR combo for several thousands less than the Honda.

About the EX:

This is the "value" minivan offered by Chrysler.  Less gizmo's than the limited or LXi, but also much less expensive.  The value is better.  

You won't get the passenger electric seat, CD changer, or the automatic AC , but you'll save a few thousand bucks.

The EX offers:
driver electric seat, passenger automatic sliding door, automatic rear gate, separate AC controls for driver/passenger/rear passengers, CD/cassette, removeable front console, traction control, garage door opener, compass and gas mileage gizmo, and the 3.8l V6.  

Ours also came with two options: the driver side automatic sliding door and leather, so it is essentially the same as the Honda EXl, but for a few thousand bucks less. 

The rear seats are split, so you can remove one or both for extra storage.  I currently pulled out one of them (it's actually very easy...try it at the dealership, you'll be amazed...and the seats are pretty light, and come on weels to push on the ground).  On the Honda, you cannot leave one half of the seat up, must fold both all the way down, or leave both up.  I think the Chrysler offers more choices on what you can to do with the seats.  Very convenient, very flexible.

What can I say about the automatic doors? Easy to use, just push the buttons on the remote, or on several locations inside.  You can also open it mannualy.   The back gate beeps before opening to warn others to get out of the way.  Handy with bags of groceries in both hands, or while carrying the kids.

The minivan rides and handles securely and safely. The tire roar is well insulated from the inside and wind noise is nonexistent.  It's quieter than the Honda and all other minivans out there.

The engine is smooth.  At low speed, you'll hear the engine, but it's not intrusive.  At high speeds, it's nonexistent.  It is fairly powerful. Expect just under 9 seconds to 0-60, although I haven't timed it, so this is a guess.  The Honda is fast at 7.9 seconds.  However, the Chrysler feels powerful with the 3.8l engine (don't go for the smaller engine, too weak) and you'll be able to pull into the highway or pass without any worries.  A new 3.5L engine is coming later this year, supposed to have 235 HP...

The seats are very comfortable.  View is excellent at all angles.  Controls seem logical.  No complaints.  Standard radio/CD has 6 speakers and sounds good--above average for cars, but the 10 speaker system that is available is better.

When we bought the van, Chrysler installed the VCR/TV feature for free.  We haven't used it yet, other than to see if it works, as we only want to use it for long drives.  There is no reason they have to watch TV on city trips, or those less than a hour or two.  The VCR fits neatly in the front console (between the driver/passenger seat).  The LED TV screen is just under 7 inches and displays a fine picture.  Two cordless headsets come with the VCR so that the kids can watch TV while you listen to your favorite tunes on the radio.  There is an optional DVD player you can get instead of the VCR, but two disadvantages I see.  1: can't play recorded TV shows, ie -cartoons, sesame street, and so on.  2: from what I understand, DVD's in automobiles still have a tendency to skip alot...apparently more difficult to get these not to skip, compared to CD's.  

Hope this is helpful, I'll update this as we drive it more.  Planning a long 1500 mile trip end of June.  Let you know how that goes with the kids!  


UPDATE 15 Sept 2002

Now have &gt; 10,000 miles on the van.  As pleased with it today as I was the day I purchased it.  Did a cross country trip (2000  miles) with ease and comfort.  Drives quietly, good passing power, good mileage (about 23-24 miles/gallon at 75-80 MPH) with regular fuel.  No mechanical trouble at all.

One note about the flexibility of the third row seat:  I wanted extra storage room in the back, yet have enough seating for 5.  Since the third row seat is a split seat, I was able to meet my needs by removing one of them and keeping the other one.  This is an advantage over the "magic" seat of Honda...  With Honda's, you either keep the third row seat up, or down.  Not one half of it.  If you want the extra seating, you have to unload your stuff.   I was able to have the extra seating and the extra storage.  Granted you have to have a garage to put the other seat in during that time, but it's  a nice option.

One minor inconvenience:  While the cruise control operation is on the steering wheel, the buttons are not illuminated at night.  Cruise control is thus essentially useless at night, unless you turn the interior light on to see what which button you need to push.

October 2003
The minivan still drives great; no mechanical problems whatsoever (31,000 miles).  Still like it very much!

Note that Chrysler will have fold down flat seats available sometimes in 2004
