            I own a 1998 black Mercury Mystique and I love it!!! I fell in love with the car the first time I saw one. We special ordered our car because there were a lot of extra features that we wanted on it. We purchased the car in June of 1997, so we didn't have a lot of cars to pick from on the lot. That is another reason why we special ordered. Like I stated earlier, our's is black. It is 4 door with lots of extra features such as moon roof, spree packaging (which included a rear spoiler, alloy wheels, decals, and special floor mats. The only features that the car offered and we do not have is leather interior and factory car alarm. The car rides very smooth and has minimal road noise. It has plenty of room for passengers and cargo. We have taken many trips in it and have always had plenty of room. It gets good gas mileage. The best part is the look! It is such a pretty car. It has the look of a sports car with the room and comfort of a family car.We have had to take our car into the service department several times though. We have not had any major mechanical problems, mainly cosmetic. For example, we took it twice because of the front grill chipping. Things like that. The only mechanical problem we have had is with our moon roof. We have had to get the motor for it replaced twice now. That is the only thing I would not recommend getting is the moon roof. It is a lot of fun but is more trouble than it is worth.Overall, I LOVE this car! We have thought several times that we should get something else but I just can't part with it.<br><br>
