            I purchased my PDC-700 at Wal Mart of all places.  I believe I got it for $175 and nowhere else I tried had it cheaper.<br>As far as quality of photographs, it has been adequate.  For family pictures or sending images it does a decent job.  With no zoom it is rather limited in the detail you can get from a distance of 10-15 feet or greater.<br><br>I have found that this camera sucks battery life quickly.  If at all possible, plug the camera into the wall and save your batteries.  <br><br>Another feature that is difficult is the LCD display.  Very hard to see in bright light and the buttons seem very slow to respond if at all.  The different functions are very erratic .  Often I have to mash them several times to get any response. <br><br>This camera is a decent starter camera.  The amateur shutter bug that is not looking for great quality or quick response would do fine with this one.  However, I have been a little disappointed with mine and look forward to upgrading in the near future.<br><br><br><br><br>
