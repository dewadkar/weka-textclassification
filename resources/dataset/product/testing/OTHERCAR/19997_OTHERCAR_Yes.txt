            The Lexus ES 300 provides a smooth and quiet ride.  The luxury is unparalled: leather seats, 2 garage door openers as well as a security gate opener, 6 CD changer in the glove compartment, et cetera.  The best part about the car is its pick-up, which offers a superior driving experience.  I highly recommend leasing one for several reasons: the car is excellent and will never let you down, you will have it in its best 3 years or so and even then the car is extremely sought after, and that means that the lease price is not so high because of its popularity.  This is absolutely the best car I have ever driven and taints the experience of driving anything else.  It looks sleek, drives smoothly, and adds countless levels of enjoyment to cruising on the road.<br><br>
