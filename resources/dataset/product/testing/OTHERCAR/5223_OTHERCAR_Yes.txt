            A year after buying the Fuji DX-10 digital camera, I'm still pleased with it.  It's small, portable, came in a nice leather case with little pockets for an extra memory card, and has a useful zoom feature.

The best thing about this camera was that it came with a floppy disk adapter so you can bypass messy and unpleasant tasks like attaching and detaching cables to your computer ports.  Just take your Smart Card out of the camera, pop it into the floppy adapter, then put it in your floppy drive.  The software that came with it also was easy to install and to use. I love being able to take photos of my work for my websites, or deliver fast work to my clients.

You'll probably need to buy a bigger memory card than the 8 mb that comes with it, even though that holds quite a few exposures.  I made a mistake trying to take it to Europe last summer, because I didn't get the larger smart card properly programmed, so I was stuck with the smaller capacity (luckily, we had our new Olympus panoramic camera, too).  

If you plan to take this camera on a vacation, be sure you have the biggest Smart Card you can get.  At least you can delete images you don't like on the spot, and keep shooting until you're satisfied.  Be sure to have plenty of batteries, though!<br><br>
