            I bought my '93 MR2 Turbo in late summer of '97.  I loved (still love) almost everything about this machine.  First off, it looks AMAZING! No pictures will do this car justice.  Every time you step out of it, you want just want to to stare at it from every angle.  Secondly, these babies are RARE.  Its awesome to have an affordable exotic that turns heads like you wouldn't believe, and you NEVER see other ones on the road, which adds a degree of exclusivity.  Third, the interior is far and away the best laid out cockpit ever put in ANY car.  A total feeling of comfort and control.  The 3-in-1, 8-speaker, 200 watt stereo will rock your world if the intoxicating engine note doesn't do the trick.  Finally, the POWER is wonderful!  You can loaf around town in silky smooth luxury, but tap the loud pedal and you are greeted with a glorious growl and a forceful surge forward.  Also, if you push it through tight curves at high speed, this car will carve the road like a surgeon with no body roll to speak of.  The brakes slow down the action effortlessly with smooth controllability.  The icing on the cake is impeccable reliability.  My car has 94,000 miles, is as solid as a rock, and has been to the shop ONCE for a broken alternator belt, that's it.

The only downfalls are, first off, these things EAT rear tires because of the mid-engine layout.  You're lucky to get 12,000-15,000 miles (depending on conditions) out of a set of rear tires.  Next, these cars are for fair weather only.  DO NOT TRY TO DRIVE ONE IN SNOW!!  Even in the rain, the rear end is quick to break loose when the turbo spools up.  Some people have a problem with insurance costs, but I get around that by having a second car and using a multi-car discount insurance rate.  It works out great for me because I can keep my cheapo VW for winter, store the MR2, and I only pay about $600/year for excellent coverage (24-year old male, single, not so perfect driving record :-)

In closing, you simply can not beat the experience of owning a car that you look forward to driving everyday.  The novelty of a good MR2 never wears off.  If you can find one, DON'T HESITATE!<br><br>
