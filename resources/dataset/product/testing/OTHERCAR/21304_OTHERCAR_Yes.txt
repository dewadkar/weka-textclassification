            I just recently bought my first Chrysler produced automobile, a 1993 Plymouth Sundance, and so far am very impressed.  I have owned many cars in my short life (two Ford Escorts, a Mercury Topaz, a Chevy Cavalier and a Chevette, and the worst, a Toyota Corolla), and aside from the Ford Escort and the Chevy Cavalier, none have been as fun to drive as this one.  Fuel economy is very good, and the car is in very good shape, though since it sat for about two months in a car lot's storage it had a few fuel system issues.  These are fixed by simply letting the car warm up for a couple of minutes.  Also, mine has an aftermarket Alpine CD player, which is nice since Chrysler stereo's suck anyways!  lmao!  It is also a 5-speed stick, and, while not the quietest transmission in the world, it's a breeze to operate.  I know all of the stories about chrysler automatics, so I searched all over for a manual, which i prefer anyways, much more fun!  The back seat could be a bit larger, though after owning the chevy and the fords, i'm pretty used to it, since it has enough room for my son to sit in back  or to lay the seat down for my guitar amplifiers and recording equipment.  Very quiet ride, and so far an excellent value.  Could use a bit more power (a turbo or a better cam would be GREAT, though i'm working on running ram air and a K&amp;N filter now!). <br><br>
