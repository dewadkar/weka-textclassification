            I received my 1998 Nissan Sentra GXE as a graduation gift from my parents when I graduated college.  My car, whom I call Lucy, is AWESOME.  My friends and I named her Lucifer because I've gotten into several accidents with her.  (So, we call her &quot;Lucy&quot; for short.)  I have been rear-ended twice, driven off the road, and hit in the parking lot of a grocery store.  Lucy's seat belt system is AWESOME.  Nothing happened to the interior of the car, and the exterior was merely scratched.  In one accident (where a woman ran a stop sign and I drove off the road to avoid her), all of Lucy's tires were destroyed because I jumped a 6&quot; curb.  However, there was NO manifold damage.

Lucy gets great gas mileage, too.  As a matter of fact, she's the car that my friend and I plan on driving to Alaska from NY.  With the recent rise in the cost of gas, this should seriously be taken into consideration.  I get about 315 miles per tank, using 87.

All of my friends love driving Lucy.  My best friend, who drives a big Bonneville and doesn't like little cars, absolutely adores Lucy.  My roommate, who hates any car that isn't manual, can't wait to begin the cross-country trip with her.

Lucy is a great little car, as was the 1986 Nissan (Datsun) 200sx that I had before her.  The next time I purchase a car, I plan on going Nissan.<br><br>
