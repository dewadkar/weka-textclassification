            This camera has the best features for the price: 4MP, 4X Optical Zoom, SD memory card compatible, 16 MB internal, can add lenses for more zoom or pan, 6 shots in burst mode at 3 fps. Can use AA batteries for emergencies. This camera includes the dock station, which is sold separately with most other Kodak cameras. 

I used the camera for night shots of the lunar eclipse. Of course that is a demanding type of a shot, and although it isn't a professional image, I can see the darker and lighter sides of the moon. For night shots I had to use a tripod as the camera becomes sensitive to movement because it's trying to be as sensitive as possible to light. I found that it was better to take pictures with only partial digital zoom and then magnify the picture. 

The burst mode works really well, the only thing is that because of the speed of the shots, the flash cannot refresh that fast so it is disabled in burst mode, making this mode best used for outdoor shots. 

The flash is very powerful and the indoor pictures look well lit and colorful. 

Another thing that I really like about this camera as future expansion is that I can add a lens adapter and extra lenses to get even better zoom or a better pan view, while still having a compact camera, rather than an SLR-type (along with the size).

When I was shopping around I compared with quite a few other cameras, but these features in other cameras cost a lot more, or this price range in other cameras would either give up the resolution or the zoom or even being able to add lenses. 

My biggest pet peeve with my old 35mm camera is that it would not take the picture right away. It would auto-focus and think twice before it would take the shot. With this camera, I press and the picture is taken almost right away. I went to Staples, where the cameras on display are functional, and tested out the response time of the shot between the various models.  The ones that seemed the best to me were the Kodak DX6440 and the DX6490.  It&#146s awesome, now I can get the picture I thought I was going to get!!  

Update Dec. 19, 2003:
My one complaint about the camera is the "status light" location.  It happens to be right next to the view finder.  It is quite bright and annoying when trying to look through the viewfinder.  It is virtually impossible to use the viewfinder which is inconvenient if trying to save batteries.  I asked Kodak customer support if it could be turned off, and they responded that it could not.  I will be fine using the LCD for the most part, but I can see myself wanting to use the viewfinder and getting annoyed at the light.  If you want to use the viewfinder a lot, this might be something you might want to try out at a store like Staples, where you can try out the cameras on display.
