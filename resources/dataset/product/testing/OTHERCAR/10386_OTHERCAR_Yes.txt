            I bought a Kia Sephia because of the price and the ease of buying it.  With no down payment you could simply walk in and drive one out. While test driving the Sephia I found it was easy to drive and was comfortable. 

The Sephia gets great gas mileage (20 miles per gallon or better)and has easy up keep.

The problem I have with it is the lack of power.  I bought mine when I lived in an area that was fairly flat, there it did O.K.  I now live in an area that is mountainous and find that it has a problem getting up hills.  It is constantly changing gears.  The major problem however is lack of dealers who can service it. I found that now I must drive 90 miles of more just to get the oil changed.  

Problem two, it could use better shocks.

Would I buy one today?  No, not unless there was a local dealer.<br><br>
