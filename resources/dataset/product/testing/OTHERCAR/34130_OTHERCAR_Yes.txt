               Engine
First off lets start with the Nissan 240SX's engine.  The 240SX (Also known as the Silvia in Japan, and the 200SX in Australia ), holds a KA24DE power plant that produces about 155 horses and 160 lbs of torque.  The car can use about 40 - 50 or more horses to be competitive with its rivals (eg Honda Prelude).  The cars 2.4 liter engine can handle more power than a jaw dropping 155 hp.  This car was meant to have around 220 hp (as it is in Japan).  If you want more power you can have a turbo intalled or you can get the Japan Spec Engine, which is the SR20DET turbo engine (highly recomended).  Don't get me wrong the KA24DE is a very good motor and is very dependable.

   Handling 
The 240SX is a great hanling car.  It surpasses the prelude in its turning radius.  The car can handle taking quick 90 degree turns at 30 mph.  Its quite stable (especially the SE model).  

   Interior
The interior is pleasing.  There is no uneeded instruments in the cockpit and everything is easy to reach.  The car comes with power windows.  Power locks and power sunroof are options.  The front seats are very roomy.  However the back seats aren't as comfortable.  The back seats fit 2 kids or 2 relatively small adults (like 5'7 and below).  The noise of the relatively loud engine is quited in the cabin as long as windows are closed.  The trunk space is not very spacious because its a sports car so be ready for that.  

   Exterior
The exterior is very pleasing to the eye.  The car is complemented well with the small spoiler on the trunk.  The car looks like nothing else on the road and is a very attractive car. 

   Overall 
Overall the 240SX is a great car that can use a little boost to those who want more power.  Its very nimble on its feet.  It's very reliable I have never had to take it to the mechanics for any major problems.  All that you need to do is the regular maintenence.  It also makes a great project car, especially with the original Japanese engine, the SR20DET.
