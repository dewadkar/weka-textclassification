            I am very satisfied with my MVC-FD73.  It seems easier to use than a film camera.  The disk storage, view screen, and easy operation and adjustability are what make this a no-brainer for the beginner digital photographer or online auctioneer.

Having said that, a few things may come up a little short for a more seasoned user.  For starters, the picture quality is on the grainy side.  This is due to its 0.3 megapixel resolution.  I can perform a little massaging in my photo editor to improve my stuff somewhat, but normal printing of pictures on a PC may leave some folks disappointed.  Also, the lack of red-eye reduction can necessitate some editing of portraits on a photo editor, also.

I believe some research and deep thought are needed when considering this camera.  Do the pluses outweigh the minuses?  For me, they did.  I have a regular camera that I take on trips and I only use this one for online applications (webpage images, email pics, auctions, etc.).  Also, I did some serious price hunting and lucked out.  The MSRP on this one is $499.  You may be able to find one at a brick-and-mortar store for $429.  I found a new one (not refurb or demo or gray) online for $356, shipped and all.

If one needs more features, I would suggest the MVC-FD91.  My buddy has one and it has better resolution (not sure how many megapixels), red-eye reduction, and macro mode for extreme close-ups.
