            Like the title says, this thing is just about the best thing that ever happened to me. It is very easy to use! Perfect for someone who never bought a digital camera before! It is also extremely good quality!

This camera has many features, such as flash mode, zoom mode, sequence mode, and panarama mode. You can shoot in three differnt modes, super high quality, high quality, and low quality.

The camera uses a memory chip to store the photos. You simply put the card into a disk, and download them onto your computer! It's that easy! I recommend this camera to everyone!<br><br>
