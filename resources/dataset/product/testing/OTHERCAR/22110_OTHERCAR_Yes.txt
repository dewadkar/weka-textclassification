            I am very happy with my DC-215.  It is super easy to use, in fact you could probably get started without even reading the manual.  The pictures are generally pretty good, but not near the quality you would get with 2 megapixels or more.  It has a self-timer, manual exposure control,  and a zoom lens.  These are some features you will probably not find on comparably priced digital cameras.  I have experienced pretty good battery life, even better when I invested $20 in rechargeable batteries and a charger.  I also spent $30 on a compact-flash card reader because the serial interface is pretty useless.  The only negatives are that it takes at least several seconds to recover after snapping a picture, meaning you have to wait 5 to 7 seconds before you can take another picture.  Also, occasionally (about 5 percent of the time) the pictures come out with unexplainable white spots on the photo.  No one seems to be able to explain this, or know how to fix it.  But it happens so infrequently I really don't mind. Oh, also sometimes when lining up a picture in the viewfinder, my nose hits the button for the exposure control and I have to press the OK button before I can take a picture.
