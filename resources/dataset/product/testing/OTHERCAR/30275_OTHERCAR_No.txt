            I thought I was getting a decent low end digital camera.  What I got was a battery eating camera!  I was only able to take 10 photos before my batteries died.  After going through a ton of batteries, I called AGFA who told me to get the more expensive higher out put batteries.  I would have been better off throwing my money away, that didn't help either.  

I decided to purchase an adapter so I could just plug it in.  Worked twice before the adapter connector fell off and into the camera.  I put it in the trash and never looked back - please don't waste your money here!
