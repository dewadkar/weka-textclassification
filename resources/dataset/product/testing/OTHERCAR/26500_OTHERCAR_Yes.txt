              I'm writing about my 1997 Chevy S-10 LS with 3rd door option. I've put about 25,000 miles on in the past year, and am qualified to say it's a great truck. I drive 90 miles to and from work, and average 23-25 miles per gallon. With some of the hilly terrain I drive in, the 4.3L engine is the only way to go. The space behind the seat gives me room to put my gear 'out of the way' and not out in the rain. The cushion in the drivers seat was well worn when I bought the truck, so I don't know if it's a Chevy thing or if the previous owner was big. The power outlets for my cell phone are right in front of the stick shift, kinda in the way, but not bad.

  It's a two wheel drive truck, so with a little added weight in the back, it goes very well in the snow. Without the extra weight, it's tough to get around in the snow.

  Having the longer wheel base, it gives a very comfortable ride. It's my second S-10, I'd buy another, and I recommend it to anyone.<br><br>
