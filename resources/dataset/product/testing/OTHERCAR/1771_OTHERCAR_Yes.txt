            I bought my Sebring because I saw it on the road and fell in love with how it looked. I shopped around and eventually leased one in December of 1996. I leased a 1997 Sebring JXi, which is the higher end version. The JX is the less expensive version and comes with fewer standard features. 
     First of all, let me say that, like almost all convertibles, when you open the window in the rain, water will come off of the roof and windshield onto you! However, if you are a non-smoker and dont drive with the window partially open in the rain, this is not a concern. 
     The car is great to drive, visibility form the driver's seat is fantastic, the rear window is large and made of glass, so it wont turn yellow after a year or two. The car handles great(for a convertible) and it does not shake badly over rough roads. 
     My car was equipped with the optional 6 disc CD changer. Mounted in the dashboard, under the radio console, it was easy to get to when I wanted to change discs. My friend had an Eclipse convertible with the CD changer mounted in the trunk, and it was a real pain to change CD's!! The Infinity sound system sounded amazing, with the roof up, or down(even at 110 miles per hour in the Brooklyn battery tunnel) 
     My car had the &quot;Autostick&quot; option which allows you to change gears like a manual transmission but without a clutch. I have always driven standard transmission cars and thought I would like this option. Well, it turns out that I did. Having the option to downshift to pass slower traffic, or when travelling uphill, was a real plus. I enjoyed using the &quot;Autostick&quot; and an added bonus is that the car wont let you destroy the transmission. You can not downshift into first gear while you are going 80 miles per hour! The car rides like a dream on the highway and around town!
     The power roof operated flawlessly, and took only a few seconds to open or close. It was often tempting to open the roof in the winter when it was snowing(which the owners manual says you should not do when it is colder than 50degrees F)and the roof opened only slightly slower! 
 You should buy this vehicle because it is a great car and you will look very cool in it, and at the same time enjoy driving it!!
     The back seat can fit two average sized adults fairly comfortably, 5 people in this car and you are getting cramped.
