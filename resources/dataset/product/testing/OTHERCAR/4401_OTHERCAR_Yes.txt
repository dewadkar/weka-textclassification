            My wife and I had been shopping for a digital camera for months, but were waiting for some extra cash before buying one. I wanted at least 3 MP and had planned on spending over $300. Well, when Wal-Mart advertised a 6 hour 'After Thanksgiving sale' and had this Kodak 3.2 MP camera for $154, I jumped at the opportunity. 
We have been very happy with this camera and the pictures that it takes. The only disadvantage is that there is no optical zoom and the digital zoom is fairly useless. However, I have overcome this problem by planning my shots better and then editing them with photo software. I recently took a second business trip to Copenhagen, Denmark and took this camera along. I had taken pictures on my first trip there with an APS camera. While my first set of pictures was OK, it could not compare to the quality from the digital camera. Plus, with a 64MB card, I could take dozens of pictures without the worry of film. 
With this camera, I have also learned how to extend the battery life so that it is not a factor when taking pictures all day. I shut off the 'instant review' feature and the 'live shot' feature, as these are big drains on the batteries. Then, I just download all of the pictures when I'm done and delete or edit the bad ones.
While this is by no means a 'professional' camera, it is very good for the average home photographer. If it can still be found at a low price, I would highly recommend it. That is, of course, unless someone wants to spend double the amount for a similar camera with an optical zoom.
I would also like to add that, as opposed to other reviewers, I have not had any problems with my lens cap!   ;0)
