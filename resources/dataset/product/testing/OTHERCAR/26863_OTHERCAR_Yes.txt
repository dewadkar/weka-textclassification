            I have a 99 Suzuki Vitara.  I purchased this SUV in April of 2001 with only 23,000 miles on it.  Since I've had this truck I have been very glad with its handling.  

Vitara comes with a 4cyl 2.0 engine.  One has the option of Auto or Manuel.  I have the 5-spd manual trans.  This truck is fast and powerful, but not powerful enough for me.  Maybe the Grand Vitara is powerful, but that is for someone else to comment.

The Vitara looks good in and out, though the legroom is limited.  If adults sit in the rear passenger seats the driver and passenger hardly have legroom.  The front passenger's knees touch the glove compartment when someone sits in the rear.

Visibility is great.  With its medium size side mirrors and the windows all around one can see everything around them.  The rear wiper is great for the winter to wipe off any snow that accumulates.

The four-wheel drive is great.  You won't get stuck anywhere.  I have used my Vitara for off road driving and have never gotten stuck.

All around itï¿½s a nice little tough truck at an affordable price.
