            I purchased this vehicle used when it was a little over two years old and have felt that it is a good car overall. Mine is the V6 S sedan version. It has been reliable thus far, although it does not yet have a lot of miles on it. A repeated problem that I have had with it has been the brakes. I've replaced the front pads three times in three years. I think this is extreme, especially considering that I am not a particularly fast driver who makes frequent abrupt stops. Also, I drove the car mostly on interstates for the first two years that I had it. Consumer Reports also noted that brakes were a common problem for this particular year and model. 

Also, the fuel door can only be opened from inside the car. For quite a while, despite regular use of lubricant, the fuel door would stick and I could not get it open by myself. My husband would have to pull the lever inside the car while I pulled open the door outside the car. I eventually had my mechanic lubricate it and the problem has stopped.  In addition, there was a small oil leak when I purchased the car, but that was still covered under the warranty.  Otherwise, I have only had to have general maintenance done.

I really like the body style--I have repeatedly gotten compliments on what a nice car it is even now when it is five years old. In fact, I just received a compliment today! It also offers a very quiet and smooth ride. One does have to be careful because the ride is so quiet and smooth that it is easy to exceed the speed limit without realizing it! This size of the car is just about right for most anyone, including those with kids. 

The back seats are slightly cramped for adults, but kids would fit comfortably there. Also, the front seats are comfortable for short rides, but become uncomfortable after long rides. The lumbar support is not very good. The controls are very convenient and easy to use and the stereo system has an excellent sound (lots of bass). There are plenty of storage places inside the vehicle, but the trunk is not as big as one would think by looking at it from the outside. 

There are two features that I do not like on the vehicle. One is that the interior lights stay on for several minutes after the door is opened and then eventually shut off. They do shut off if you turn the ignition but otherwise stay on for several minutes. My vehicle has automatic locks and I do not like the way the doors automatically lock again if the door is opened and then closed again while the car is in any other gear besides park. 

Overall, I would recommend this car for most anyone. It is not too large and not too small and has been reliable for me. It feels luxurious and looks nice but does not cost nearly as much as luxury cars. It is an overall good value. 

UPDATE:
I just had to have my turn signal/windshield wiper/headlight control knob replaced and a tank in my radiator replaced.  These repairs and a few general maintenance items cost about $430.  I was told by my mechanic that the radiator tank problem is common in this and other GM vehicles since the tanks are plastic.  The car still has been reliable and I would still recommend it overall, but you should insure the radiator tank is checked fairly regularly.
