            I have not so much compliments for that vehicle. 
I bought it new for $32.000 CND. I sold it when less than 2 years old for $17.000 (after 3 months listing at Auto Trader). Nobody likes to buy. More than 20% of the ownership the vehicle was at Mazda service because of the design fault &#150 vibration on high speed. They never resolved that properly. I checked 2000 & 2001 Mazda MPV (numbers of them) &#150 ALL of them have the same problem.

Usually the vehicles from Japan are reliable. They are keeping high resell value (Toyota, Honda), which is part of the reason why I choose Mazda. I realized that Mazda is the worst choice of all. For example; new 2001 Dodge Minivan cost $29.000 the day before I bought Mazda MPV. Less than two years later, 2001 Dodge minivan was sold for $19.000 (private sale) and I sold my Mazda MPV for $17.000 (20 months old). Obviously values of the Mazda went down pretty rapidly, so don't be surprised if you are plan to sell it after a while. 

I bought my vehicle at Ontario Mazda. The same day I felt that something was wrong with a vehicle when driving on high speed (100km/h and over). I returned the vehicle to the dealer, but they refused to take it back. They made a promise that the problem will be fixed. 

My friend has had the same issue with LX model. He returned a vehicle very next day (with his layer as they didn&#146t want to take it back). I tried to return the vehicle 3 times. They simple didn't want to talk about that (I should bring a layer too). 

Dealer&#146s service took the vehicle more than 8 times because of the same issue. Ones they worked on the vehicle 42 days (they never gave me a service report &#150 I asked more than once). Also, Mazda&#146s inspector was involved, but nothing. If all those people were unable to fix the problem, something was really wrong with this model. Mechanic has told me (between the lines) that this is a design fault (something related to the engine and a body).

However, I put 55.000km on that vehicle. Every single kilometer reminds me how much money I gave for a defective vehicle. After an hour of driving on a highway I didn&#146t felt my hands any more. It was like working with sledgehammer. I start to hate this vehicle (and dealer). I can say that since I sold that lemon vehicle, I feel really good. 

Summary:
Fuel consumption high14-18Lit/100km, weak engine (poor acceleration), weak air condition, expensive parts, poor service, high maintenance cost ($86 for oil changing), higher insurance cost, and construction faults.
