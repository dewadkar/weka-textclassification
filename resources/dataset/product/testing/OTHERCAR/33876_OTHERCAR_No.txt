                 For five years now, I have been what the air freight industry calls a, &quot;hot-shot drive.&quot; Basically, my job is to pick up and deliver hot freight from the local airport and run it out, to out of the way rural areas which are not along the normal freight routes.     Last month, I placed 200,000 miles on my 94 Toyota Standard Cab 2.4L 5spd Pickup. Most people would fret to ever see their vehicle at such a high mileage. But I just had a smile on my face knowing that I had a friend whom I could trust. I'd like to mention, that 80% of those miles were while pulling a trailer with an average load of 1200 pounds; and at the same time, handling a 300 pound Lear bed shell.        My Toyota has grown to become my best friend, it has yet to ever let me down. From running a load of film equipment through the deserts of Utah's Monument Valley; to traversing through a wild winter storm in Wyoming, while pulling a jet engine. I have come to believe that my truck has a silent personality trait of never giving up.     Over the years, all my silent friend has ever requested in return for it's hard reliable work is a starter, a yearly valve adjustment, and the monthly oil change. I tend to believe that Toyota's, if treated right, will drive forever. Just think, this is about my 94 Pickup which usually only sees pavement. I could rant and rave about my 85 which seems only at home on those roads less traveled. This review may show that I would not recommend a Toyota Pickup to a friend. For some disturbing reason the final edit screen will not allow me to choose, YES!!!<br><br>
