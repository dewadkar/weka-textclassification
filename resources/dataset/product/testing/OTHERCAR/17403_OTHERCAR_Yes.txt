            This is my third SUV after a Isuzu Trooper and Jeep Grand Cherokee. I bought the limited because my wife loved it.

The 4Runner has a very high quality chassis. With 35,000 miles, it is as tight and solid as day 1. Reliability has always been a strong point of Toyota vehicles and this one is no exception.

The vehicle is very skiddish off road, especially on hard packed, washboard'ed jeep trails that are prevelant here in Arizona. I think it may have something to do with the big, hard tires. My Isuzu and Jeep were confidence inspiring off road. The Toyota is close to dangerous by comparison.

Interior wise, the vehicle has comfortable front seats, with very nice leather. It feels very narrow in the shoulders. My daughter's standard Jeep Cherokee is has the same shoulder width. The Grand Cherokee feels much roomier. The quality of the interior is exceptional. The controls and displays are very poor. The cupholder is a cheap plastic unit that pulls out just above the a/c vents, and blocks the two main vents ... a real nuisance on 110 degree days in AZ! It also, completely blocks the a/c controls and partially blocks the radio controls. The radio is fairly good, but again, the controls are confusing and you cannot read the display on the radio or the clock on sunny days, which with 322 in AZ, is a nuisance. 

Handling qualites are good, with very good brakes. The vehicle is harsher riding than the Grand Cherokee. The outside mirrors cannot are too limited in their outboard angle for me, although my wife does not have a problem.

All in all, this seems to be a popular vehicle with the women. I like the looks and quality. It is scary off-road, at least on hard packed jeep trails. It feels narrow inside. My wife and I are always bumping elbows when trying to share the center arm rest. This is a very reliable vehicle, has a nice image, but you should be aware of some of its shortcomings. <br><br>
