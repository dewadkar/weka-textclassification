            Well, as much as I love photography, I am getting tired of paying a lot of money for film and developing.  That's initially why I bought a digital camera.  I wanted to take lots of pictures of my growing family without the high cost. By using a digital camera I can create a computerized photo album and just print off the photos that I want.  What I didn't realize was just how good a 3 megapixel image really is!  Prints 8x10 inches are hardly discernable from a traditional photograph.
I narrowed my choice down to two cameras by handling cameras in stores and by reading reviews here at epinions and reviews in the press.  My shortlist of two were the Casio QV3000 and the Nikon Coolpix 990.  Both retail for about the same price. The Nikon had the advantage of being able to use different lenses and external flashes. However, what won me over into buying the Casio was the IBM microdrive which is included with the camera.  The Nikon Coolpix cameras cannot even use the microdrive because the memory bay is too small. I do not have a laptop computer on which to store photos while on a long vacation, so the microdrive allows me to take a lot of 3.3 megapixel pictures and not have to download them every 50 or 60 pictures.  Casio say that the microdrive can hold up to 245 3.3 megapixel images, but this is a little on the conservative side.  I recently went on a 10 day vacation to the Carolinas.  I took some 250 photographs and the camera said that I still had space for some 70 more pictures!
As for the camera itself.  It feels just the right size to fit in a my male hands and my wife found it comfortable to hold as well.  Image quality is great even at lower resolutions.  Color accuracy is great, being very true to the original subject.  Takes great night shots, but I recommend a tri-pod unless you have a steady hand.  The camera has a number of modes for shutter and aperture priority, landscape, portrait pictures etc.  However, I found myself just leaving the camera on full automatic, but it's nice to have the features. The camera is just so easy to use that I just want to take it everywhere and it doesn't get in the way. For downloading, use a USB connection, it's much faster then the very slow serial connection.  Battery usage is great, but why do Casio not include a mains power supply?
Finally, the downside of this camera.  I wish the QV3000 could use lens adapters, especially a wide angle adapter.  Also, having to remember to take the lens cap off whenever you take pictures.  The camera has a plastic push-on lens cap and this stops the lens from extending when switched on. Surely Casio could have designed this aspect of the camera better!  But these are minor points when compared to all the advantages.
My advice, if you decide to get this camera, get the 340MB microdrive version rather than the flash memory version.  It only costs $200 more, but if you buy the microdrive later it'll cost you more than twice that 
much.
One last note.  At the end of my vacation I managed to delete 250 images off the camera by accident.  Not at all easy to do, but I did it. Norton Utilities faied to recover the images and Casio said that the images were beyond rescue.  I contacted a company called DriveSavers at www.drivesavers.com and they recovered all my pictures within ten days. They are a great company to deal with.<br><br>
