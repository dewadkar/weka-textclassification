            I am the proud owner of a 1998 Chevy Cavalier. I am not an expert on cars, but I know what I like, and I would have to say that my decision to purchase this fine vehicle was one of the best ones I�d made in a while. Here are my reasons for buying and why I enjoy driving my car around town.

I was leasing a 95 Chevy S-10 Pickup Truck and in November of 1997 my lease was up. After I did some number crunching, I had realized that I had paid for well over half that truck if I was buying. But I wasn�t! So, now I had to start over with another vehicle. This time I was determined to own my own vehicle. With the way I travel around, I realized a truck is not the best way to keep clothes and schoolwork dry when it rained. As much as I loved that truck, I needed something different. I started looking around and immediately knew that SUV�s were out of my price range. To make a long story short, I narrowed my choice down to two options, A Chevy Metro (at the time known as Geo Metros) and Chevy Cavalier. Although it is a bit more expensive then the Metro, I decided to go with the Cavalier. Not to mention the Metro looks like a roller skate, and I just looked wrong in it.

I fell in love with this car from the time I took it out for a test drive. The ride was incredible, but then again I was use to my truck. First of all, in my truck, I sat a couple of feet off the ground. When I first drove my Cavalier, it felt strange at first, but the more I drove it. The more I liked it. Both the truck and the car are manuals, but for some reason driving the car seemed a lot easier to drive. I did not have to push the clutch as far down in my Cavalier, which made shifting gears in my car a lot easier. The overall ride was a lot smoother, but a good portion of the roads around here are in need of some repairs; but I still get a smooth ride every time I drive them.

The interior is roomy and comfortable. I can fit four adults or two adults and three children comfortably. The instrumentation panel and controls are well laid out, and at night are well lit. The trunk is huge! I have yet to have a problem with taking groceries and stuff home. I have never run out of room. It�s very dependable. I have yet to have a problem with it and I have had it for about two and a half years now

My Recommendation�..

I would recommend it to anyone looking for a car. It has everything you need, dual side airbags, AM/FM cassette radio, AC, and a lot more (Like I said, I�m not a car buff I just know what I like).
