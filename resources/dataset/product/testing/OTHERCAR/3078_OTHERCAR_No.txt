            I bought the Dodge Intrepid for the Price and DEPENDABILITY of a Mopar product. When looking for the first family car, we ran upon a 1996 Dodge Intrepid (Program Car) it had low mileage and lots of room. After putting it through my Road test I found it handled great for a front wheel drive and the 3.5 V6 was a power house. All the instruments were easily accessible and the Mopar AM/FM CD player was mind blowing. For the family car it was ideal, yet still sporty enough to sit back and relax in. Well it wasn't long and the little problems started showing up, the reflector in the right headlight broke loose from the housing, The replacement required the purchase of a new headlight. Replacement cost of approx. 127.00. The headlights were found to be loose while doing a NC Inspection, the problem was that the plastic tabs that hold the lights in place had broken, Reason given, Normal wear and tear, problem to be solved 127.00 each. shortly after OVERHEATING, water pump failure at 36100 miles, not covered under warranty, 100 miles over warranty, cost approx 400.00 plus. Brakes went out later while transporting our child
master cylinder failure, due to line decay. replacement cost 200.00 
later this year 1 yr and 3 months after water pump replacement, Water Pump failure again. Not covered Mopar parts are only good for 1 yr, not 1 yr and 3 months!! replacement cost 400.00 plus.. replacement of left side idle arm, after it was discovered by service man putting on new tires, it was about to break, replacement cost 150.00.
Well it is a good family car when it comes to comfort and room, it's trunk size is outstanding, and the rear seat will acommadate 2 car seats and an adult. The handling of the vehicle is wonderful, with its cab forward design and wide body, it will stick like glue in the turns and stay on the road in adverse conditions. It was so impressive that my father bought him one, 1997 Dodge Intrepid( also replaced Oxygen Sensor, Water Pump, And transmission). As far as dependability, Well you be the judge, I have since bought a car phone that stays in the car, and thank goodness I have a good friend with a wrecker. Most of the break down times the vehicle was occupied by my wife and daughter, And Once with my wife and 2 daughters.
This is only an evaluation of the 1996 1997 Dodge Intrepids. The newer models I am not nor am I ever going to be familiar with. If you are bying an Intrepid Get an EXTENDED WARRANTY, Course you may be suprised when you hear the words I am so familiar with, Wear and Tear and NOT COVERED
