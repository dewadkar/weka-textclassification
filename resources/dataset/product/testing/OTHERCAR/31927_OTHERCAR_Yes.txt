            I purchased my Subaru Forester last August, and just love it.  We had our first major snow storm today, and the Forester handled the 12 inches of snowfall without a problem.  It is a pleasure to drive in fair weather as well.  It rides quiet and smooth riding.  It is also an attractive vehicle and I frequently receive compliments about its looks from strangers.  It comfortably carries five passengers yet has plenty of cargo room, especially when the back seats are folded down.  Although it is only a 4-cylinder it has plenty of pep.  Also, it a pleasure to deal with the Subaru people.  They are friendly and knowledgeable.    <br><br>
