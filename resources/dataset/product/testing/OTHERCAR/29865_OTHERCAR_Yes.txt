            I purchased the Kodak DC-265 in June of 99 for a cruise in December of 99.  I wanted to be able to capture photos that were equal to or superior to my Nikon N90s, with all my special telephoto lenses, but did not want to lug around a lot of heavy equipment. I bought the camera early so that I would be well versed in its use long before my scheduled trip. The photos during my learning were all excellent. It shot moonrises, sunrises as well as sunsets with equal accuracy and depth of quality. This camera has met and exceeded my hopes, both in quality of images as well as its ease of use.  On my vacation in 98 I ran out of film and was unable to find the films I needed while over seas. This was very upsetting because I had to make compromises and limit the photos of my trip to my disappointment. The new digital was a revelation. I carried four flash memory cards,1-8mg, 2-16mg and 1-48mg. Along with my notebook computer, I was able to take over 250 superb photos,including some taken by my mother who's a camera phobic.  I needed no other accessories except the cable to attach to my notebook for download. We were able to view slide shows on my notebook at the end each day, and were able to free up the flash memory cards for further reuse. Upon arriving home I was able to print my pictures with my printer on photo paper and thus no processing fees.  The reprints were perfect each time unlike when taken to a lab. I wish I could include some of my photos because a picture is worth a million words. The ease of e-mailing my photos is an extra bonus. The pictures print as well as they show on my computer screen.<br><br>
