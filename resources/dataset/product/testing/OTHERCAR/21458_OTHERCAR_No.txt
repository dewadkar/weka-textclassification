            Mitsubishi made a very bad choice with this one!!  The decision to replace the Turbo version of the 2nd Generation Eclipse with the V-6 was one of the biggest mistakes that any Japanese Car maker could have done.  Beginning with the extinction of the affordable Japanese sports car starting with Toyota when they decided to discontinue the Supra to the discontinuation of the 300Z by Nissan to the cancellation of the Turbo Eclipse. <br> The 95-98 Turbo version of the Eclipse is one of the most enjoyable cars I've driven... I even own one.  The 2000-2001 Eclipse I'm afraid i cant say the same for.  If you are planning on purchasing and base models (i.e. not the GT version) dont waste your money, go buy a Civic or an Integra for the same money, they are much more reliable cars.  The GT V-6 version of the Eclipse is a quick car, but the mechanical, electrical, and just overall hassle of keeping the noise-less is a task that nobody is up for, not only in the new eclipse, but also the old ones.  Squeeks everywhere imaginable, very little room inside, even for the driver and front passenger, and other problems that one shouldnt worry about when buying a car.  Not to mention the horrible service you receive at the dealership and during service. <br>My opinion on this car is simple... dont buy one, and if you do, I can almost guarantee you will never buy a Mitsubishi again.<br><br><br>
