            I bought the camera because it was small and compact when I saw it on QVC and in addition it came with a printer. I thought, based on the demonstration, the quality was excellent. So I bought it. Taking pictures was fun. Reviewing the pictures was exciting and being able to delete any unwanted pictures was great.  Loading the films was easy.  The software for edit the pictures was not adequate with regards to options in terms of color.  The borders were quite limited.   There should be more options for borders.
 Printing the picture, the quality was a bit disappointing.  It was not was not as clear as I thought it would be. The pictures came  out a bit grainy and fuzzy.<br><br>
