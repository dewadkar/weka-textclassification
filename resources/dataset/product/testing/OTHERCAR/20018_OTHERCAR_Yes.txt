            A couple weeks ago AOL had a pop-up ad on the opening screen showing the Largan Chameleon digital camera. I was interested because of the extremely small size and the easy payment plan they offered.

Also, the 30day free trial, money back guarantee, that is standard with AOL purchasing didn�t hurt, either. So, I made a few clicks, and in a few days, I had my Chameleon.

Size? This little baby is smaller than a deck of cards and weighs about 2.5 oz. � not a have-along problem any time.

It is really just a new generation of the old Kodak �point & shoot� pocket, snapshot camera � without the film, developing, and all the inconvenience that went with it. Its little leather, fitted carry case is belt-looped and easy to grab. The flash is just like the old built-ins on the first point-shoot cameras. Don�t try to use it too close or too far. When they say �best at 5-7 feet�, they mean it! Any closer, and you �wash out� with too much light, any farther away , and you start losing color and getting gray.

The download software is way powerful! Way too much for this little guy � but fun to use with other pics that you may have stored on your hard drive! Oh sure, it does everything it�s supposed to do - with the Chameleon, but the low res of the Chameleon won�t let the really good features of the software be utilized.

This little camera is for, like they say, �point & shoot snapshots� - quick & easy. Plenty of room for as many as you want to take, quick re-charge time on the flash, great for parties, trips to grandma�s house, pet antics, and kids acting up. Portraits? No. Still lifes? No. Close-ups of art, jewelry, coins, or flowers? No. But for kidding around fun? Now you got it�

About the size of a cell phone, I take mine along just to have it along. Maybe I�ll use it, maybe I won�t. Dependable & quick � what the heck, why not?

As with other buyers, I have a �serious� digital camera and then I got the Chameleon for quick, �snap� shooting of an unexpected or fun stuff � just to have handy. The CD-rom software that comes with it is really one of its best features...give it a try...for the price, why not?
