            SIX MONTH UPDATE on 11/13/00: Six months and 6,500 miles into this car, pretty much everything written below still stands. We're happy with the car and its performance and have had no mechanical problems whatsoever. A couple of observations -- styled as a sports sedan, the car rides relatively low, meaning that exterior road noise is considerable if not objectionable. Also, having driven to San Franciso from LA and back, four-five hours uninterrupted is about the max before serious discomfort sets in; the seats are adequately comfortable, but not sensationally so. This was more of a problem for my wife than for me. But then, this is NOT a luxury car.

I recently signed a lease on my 6-cyl 2000 Mazda 626 LX after lengthy comparisons with the 6-cyl. Honda Accord and the relatively peppy, surprisingly impressive 4-cyl., 155 hp Nissan Altima. After several test drives, and some haggling, I settled on the Mazda, and so far I'm glad I did. 

In looking for a cost/benefit my wife and I believe we've gotten more car for the money. The Mazda we bought contains the standard LX package of AC, 4-speed automatic, AM-FM/single CD player (with factory cassette installed after-the-fact by the dealer at my request), illuminated keyless remote entry, dual cellphone power outlets, 60/40 split fold down rear seat to expand the already large trunk, etc. Ultimately, my wife and I wanted a car that for the first time was a step up for us from either a van (95 Ford Windstar) or a compact (96 Honda Civic and 97 Chevy Cavalier Coupe). But with twins bound for college (and taking the Civic and the Cavalier), and the need for four vehicles, we couldn't afford even the low-end luxury cars. 

We picked the Mazda for several reasons: First, though I know it's been knocked in the press for its conservative, no-risk design, we think it looks pretty sharp, and a heckuva lot better than the boxy Accord and the odd-shaped Altima. We picked the darker so-called &quot;moonlight gray&quot; color that lends an air of distinction without the pedestrian silver-metallic color. The re-worked grill is simple and classy, and the slightly raised rear with the sharp-edged rear passenger windows makes the post '97 626 look less like a sagging tear drop than its predecessors, and more like a sports sedan. Secondly, it drives very nicely. Though it isn't the most powerful six I've driven (this ain't no Maxima), the standard 2.5 liter 24 valve engine with a modest 170 hp is more than adequate for a family car requiring occasional quick acceleration on LA highway on and off ramps. Noise levels are acceptable at all speeds. The Mazda also feels heavier and smoother on the road than the Accord and the Altima, without being ponderous. Turning radius is tighter than one would think of a car this size, and I have found the steering to be very responsive. Third, it's comfortable. Lots of room in the back for passengers, decent lumbar support in the front, and effective manual height control for the driver's seat cushion. 

A couple of nice touches: the AC vent in the middle of the dash has a &quot;swing&quot; option to oscillate it back and forth so you don't get brain freeze on a very hot day, and overhead above the rear view mirror is a pull-down slot for holding sunglasses. Cute, and actually useful! Mazdas also come with an excellent 50,000 mile or 36 month bumper-to-bumper warranty and roadside assistance program, and with a numeric car key code that allows for instant ordering of replacement keys from Mazda in case of loss.

Criticisms? Yes, a couple, though I'm sure if we'd paid for the ES package some of these would have been eliminated. Console by the driver's right side is pretty shoddily constructed, even by modern plastic standards. Interior overhead lighting is not very good; I miss the focus from spotlight bulbs in my Windstar. The cloth seats don't look like they'll wear very well over time, but we'll see. The cup holders are not size-flexible, meaning some odd-shaped or large cups, cans or bottles won't fit. 

ABS was not an option for me, but the 4-wheel disc brakes have performed very well when required in all weather.

This is a very good car for people on a budget seeking a significant step up from compactville. Do not buy the 4-cyl. 626 if you require highway driving; the car is too heavy, and it didn't have enough hp or torque to give me what I needed when I asked for it; I saw a lot of 1- and 2-year-old 4 cylinder 626s on sale in used car lots, and no 6-cylinders. My much lighter '96 Civic could have probably wiped out a 4 cyl. 626 on an on-ramp. I feel good about the car, and my wife -- who truthfully can't tell the difference between a Honda Civic and a BMW by looking at them -- actually volunteered that the 626 looked much nicer than the Accord or Altima. Assuming it's as reliable as the 626 track record indicates it should be, I'd say it's worth giving serious consideration to. I'll let you know how I feel a year from now.<br><br>
