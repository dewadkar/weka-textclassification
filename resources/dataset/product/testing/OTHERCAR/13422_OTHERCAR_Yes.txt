            When I needed a vehicle that would be able to withstand all the snow that Ohio gets and still protect me I had to go a lot of places. Eventually I found the Blazer and knew it was perfect. This SUV comes with the full requirements needed when you live in a place with a lot of snow. Not only does it have 2 and 4 wheel drive but you have the option of changing from low to high depending on how stuck you get in the snow which is helpful in Ohio. It's comfort is not bad either. It has the leather seats that provides great comfort for both driver and passenger. Next is its features. The ac and heat come in handy when summer and winter come around because it is easily adjusted to the climate you need. It comes with power windows also when you don't want the ac and power locks that provides easy access and a remote for easy access also. The trunk space is large for when people need to carry big loads which is many times the case with SUV's.
I suggest that anyone looking in the area of SUV look at the Blazer. It provides all the features and luxuries needed with the added enjoyment of smooth braking and accelaration and easy control with the steering. Also the price range is very affordable for the middle class person.<br><br>
