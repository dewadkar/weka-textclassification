                 My wife are shopping for a new Sport Ute for her. We went to test drive this car with different intentions.  I was thrilled with all of the features that I'd read about and couldn't wait to see in action.  She thought it was the ugliest car that she'd ever seen on the road and didn't want to like it.  The outcome:  She had such a hard time deciding between this car and the Lexus RX 300 that I had to make the decision for her.
     When it comes to engineering and features, you can't beat the car for the price.  The ride is comfortable, though a bit noisy on the highway- but what do you expect for a REAL SUV.  It is unique in its class.  The marriage saving &quot;his and hers&quot; climate control settings almost took us over the top.  Dual sunroofs, stadium seating, ample power and comfort!
     I have to say that the decision not to buy this car didn't come from anything that we didn't like about the look, feel, and ride.  The primary dirving factor was the gas mileage and the fact that premium gas is a must.  Living in Connecticut- the land of the highest gas taxes in the country- this was the deal breaker.  I'd still love to have the car.  My Hungarian Vizsla would look really cool in it!
