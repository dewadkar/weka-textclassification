            We love our Legacy Outback Wagon!  This is our second Subaru Wagon. The first was going so strong with 158,000 miles on it..after 6 hard years that we gave it to our medical student son who lives in Los Angeles and really needs dependable transportation for his surfboard and all of his buddies.

We throw our skiis on top (or they fit inside if the weather is terrible!), grab the dog and the luggage and head for snow country as often as possible.  The Outback gives us road security and the drive is so comfortable.  This is not like being in a converted truck; this is nice, luxurious driving. 

If the road closes for awhile, we are toasty and able to listen to the radio or our books on tape and not worry.

In the summer, we head for the beaches, loading up picnic chests, umbrellas (and the dog) and our portable kayaks.  

The gas tank is plenty big (and they lied about the mileage..I get much better mileage..often close to 30 mpg on the freeway!) so I don't have to stop very often (except to let the dog out).

I can't imagine not having Subaru in our future forever!
