            I bought this car after my last one was totaled in an accident (not my fault however =) I've had it since January 2000 and so far it has been very reliable and yielded great gas mileage. The Impulse (as with the Asuna Sunfire) come stock with Lotus handling which makes cornering at high speeds easy and effortless. The pickup and ride is great as well, (1.6L DOHC 4-cylinder) especially with an aftermarket turbo and K&amp;N filter. There are however, a few things that could be better, such as a constant ticking noise from the engine (and no it's not just mine), a poorly designed &quot;sticky&quot; hatchback, very cramped rear seating capacity, and the fact that aftermarket toys are extremely hard to find. Even simple racing pedals will not fit, and similarly my search for ultra bright white main halogens has been futile. Overall I love the car, its pros far outweigh its cons... and i would suggest it as a first car for anyone, especially for its great gas mileage.<br><br>
