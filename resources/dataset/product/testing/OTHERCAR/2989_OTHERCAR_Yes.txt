                 Yes, Gandolf knows his jeeps.  The only way I ever got more
room in mine, was to take the back seat out.  A must if you want
room, but only if you plan to only give rides to a signal person.  I
own a 93' with over 2 hundred thousand miles, and more dents in it
than anybody can count.  Any other car would be in the junk pile
by now.  I got it as a hand down from my father.  He bought
another Wrangler.  He drove it were no man has gone before.  And
yes I have had my share.
     The cons really don't affect me that much.  I fixed the space
problem by giving up ride capacity.  All the noise means nothing to
me I just crank the radio.  The high ride has no effect on me, I'm
young.  It's a perfect auto for me.
     The part of owning a Jeep I like the most is if a dent occurs you can bang it out with a
hammer, paint what needs to be painted ant its good as new.  Oh yes and winter would
trap me at my house if it were not for the 4 wheel drive<br><br>
