            My father bought a Lexus LS 400 the first year they were in production (1990). He drove it to work every day for nine years, putting over 100,000 miles on it. He had no problems with it at all except for a brake problem last year that the dealership was happy to fix. He has purchased a new LS 400 since then and I bought his from him. I drive it at least 30 miles every day and it has never given me any problems. It handles wonderfully and is a very smooth riding car. From the sound system to the powerful V8 engine, this is one of the best, if not the very best type of car I have ever driven or ridden in. If you are looking for a luxury car that is top of the line than this is your car. <br><br>
