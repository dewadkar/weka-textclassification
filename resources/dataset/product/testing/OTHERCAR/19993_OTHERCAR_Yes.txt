            I have been leasing the lexus ES 300 for a couple of years, and I must say that it is one of the better cars I have driven.  The engine is very quiet, which minimizes distraction, and the leather seats are extremely comfortable.  It has good turning, and the brakes are simply amazing.  You could stop on a dime with this car.  The only feature I dislike is the gas pedal.  It is harder to push down than other cars I have driven, which is a little bit annoying.  Besides this, however, the price is a little steep, but it is appropriate for this type of quality car.  Give it a test drive and see for yourself.  Even used ones still run great.
