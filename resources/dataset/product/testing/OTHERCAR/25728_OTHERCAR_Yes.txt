            I currently own a 99 Beetle GLS. I love this car. I chose an automatic (to my disappointment) because my fiance' and I do mostly city driving. The auto works pretty well, but tends to rev high. It isn't very nice to have an auto in heavy Seattle traffic though. It's comfortable, and except the rear head room very spacious for the size of the car. The stereo works and sounds great. No complaints about the interior of this car. Audi and VW (same company for those who didn't know) have done a great job of making sure this car is very well put together. We've driven the car almost 40,000 miles in the last year, and it's been good to us all the way. This car blows away it's competition in pretty much every way. I'm still smiling at the cool indiglo blue display. It's not only a very unique and stylish little car, but it's very well appointed. Aftermarket is very strong for this car now too. I currently installed H&amp;R Lowering springs which lowered the car 1.5 inches, and I have no regrets. The car handled great when I got it, but you stick some stiffer springs under the car and it handles and corners better than the average sports car. I also added 18&quot; Radius wheels which helped the handling out quite a bit too. I'd recommend this car to just about everyone. It's great for running around town or a long trip and always gets attention. Functional, Fun, Reliable, and is built very well. The quality of this car is almost unbelievable. One thing I will say to anyone going to buy one though, GET A TURBO, and get it in silver! The stock 2.0 is a great little run around town motor, but it sure could use that turbo acceleration kick. It's a great motor for what it is. The Civics, Corollas, and Focus 4s just can't compare buy any means. The Bug does like to have it's oil changed to synthetic, it runs a lot smoother on 
0-50 Mobil 1 Pure Synthetic. Oh yes, and the best thing I ever did to this car was buy the European Headlight switch, the daytime running lights are extremely annoying and not bulb friendly. So get the Euro switch from an aftermarket supplier if you can so you can turn them off. (It has other features but that's another story)<br><br>
