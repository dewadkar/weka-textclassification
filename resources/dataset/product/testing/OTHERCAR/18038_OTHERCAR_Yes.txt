            The 2000 Special Edition Mazda Miata is the second Miata that I've owned and also the second one I have reviewed here at Epinions. I purchased a new 1999 Leather Edition Miata in the spring of 1998 and traded it in for this model in the summer of 2000. I have been in love with deep burgundy Miatas since the 1995 Mica Merlot M Edition (which I couldn't afford to buy at the time) so that was a strong factor in purchase decision. Additionally, I wanted to own a 6 speed manual transmission Miata instead of the standard 5 speed.

All special, limited, &quot;M&quot; or anniversary edition Miatas are produced in limited quantities. Finding my Miata, once I had decided to buy it, was not an easy task. Chances are if you haven't purchased a 2000 SE model by now, you will have a difficult time finding one in new condition. However, patience and persistence often pay off and you may find one at a dealership within driving distance if you look hard enough. Locally, a nearby dealership had one with 2000+ miles on it, and another local dealership had the one that I ended up purchasing with only 80 miles on it, but scratch on the hood, which they repaired to like-new condition for free.

<b>Special Features</b>
My Special Edition Miata came with the following special features which aren't standard on the 2000 line of Miatas:

- 6 speed manual transmission
- Nardi wood finish steering wheel
- Nardi wood finish shifting knob
- Light cream colored leather interior
- Silver kick plates and door handles
- White gauge faces with silver trim rings
- Shiny silver alloy wheels
- Mahogany mica color (deep burgundy)
- Picnic backpacking SE &quot;gift package&quot; with Miata coffee table book

I love all of these features on the SE which is yet another reason I was so driven to purchase it. Some commentary on a few of these features is in order, however.

<i>6 speed manual transmission</i>
You've heard the old <b>Spinal Tap</b> joke about the dial that goes up to 11, haven't you? Well, when I first heard about the six-speed manual transmission, I thought that this might be the same sort of thing. Oh yay, so it goes up to sixth gear. Just more work for the same results.

I'm very pleased to say that after test driving the car, I found that this was noticeably not so. The extra gear allows for a couple of things; First, I find that I can come off the line much quicker with a lower ratio between shifting in the low end of the gears. This seems to give me more pep in the engine for the same amount of horsepower. And up at the high end, the sixth gear means that cruising along at faster speeds is much more comfortable than it is in a standard 5 gear setup. In my old Miata, if I did 85MPH, I would feel a strain on the gearbox and a higher whine from the engine. The horses were definitely breaking a sweat. In this Miata, 85MPH in sixth gear feels about the same to me as 65-70MPH felt in fifth gear on the older car. It makes cruising very comfortable at highway speeds.

<i>Nardi wood finish steering wheel and shift knob</i>
Don't kid yourself. These two features are for looks only. They do not feel better or make the car perform better. The wood finish on the steering wheel means that it's hotter than its leather counterpart in the summer and also that your hands will sweat more noticeably on the wheel, as the material is completely non-porous.

The shift knob isn't much better in the comfort department. The shiny silver trim at the bottom of the shift knob has just about branded my hand on a few occasions.

Both of these extras rank low on the performance scale but they are, without a doubt, absolutely beautiful to look at. I didn't expect otherwise, but if you're considering purchasing a car with these accents, you should make sure you aren't expecting them to be highly beneficial for your use either.

<i>Picnic set</i>
I can't believe I'm writing about a picnic set in a Miata review but they DID include it after all! We've found the picnic set very useful. It consists of a nice backpack that is designed to hold a wine bottle (not included), plastic wine goblets (2), plates (2), silverware (for 2), salt and pepper shakers, tablecloth, napkins (2), cheese cutting board and knife. It's very useful and we've already used it with great success.

<b>New Standard Miata Features</b>
I have noticed three new features for the 2000 model year that weren't included in the 1999 model year.

- Interior emergency trunk opening mechanism
I think this must be included by law now. It's pretty laughable to consider that anyone might stuff another full-sized human into a Miata trunk but now, if they do, there's a way out. Just pull on the little handle and unwedge your body to freedom.

- Gas cap tether
This makes it impossible to leave your cap at the gas station and is quite annoying, because you can only put the cap on the car, which I hate doing because it can leave little scratches. This is but one in a long list of &quot;idiot proofing&quot; mechanisms the Miata has (also on this list is the lighter that doesn't work when the car isn't running which has caused my cellphone to turn off when I run quick errands and leave it in the charger). I hate idiot proofing mechanisms. Let the idiots suffer, say I. But, if you chronically lose gas caps at the station, I guess you might find this a plus. I'm about to take scissors to the tether line, myself.

- Roadside assistance program
Now THIS is worthwhile! In my 1999 Mazda Miata review you will read about how I was left stranded by the road due to an electrical problem the car had. That was the one thing I faulted the car for. This guarantees that for the duration of your 3 year, 50k mile manufacturer's warranty, you have free roadside assistance 24x7, 365 days a year.

<b>Other Miata-isms</b>
Because I've taken up so much space exploring the SE-specific and 2000 year new features, I will briefly go over the rest of the car and why I love it and why you might also love it, or why you might hate it.

<i>The Ride</i>
The Miata is a peppy, small sportscar. If you are tall, it will not be comfortable for you. If you take up relatively little mass, you will find it much more comfortable, but may still find it a little cramped for long rides. It's a joyous little roadster designed for driving around town with the top down. It is not great for long road trips or bad weather.

I can't say for sure why, but when the top is up, driving in the Miata is a miserable experience. The view is blocked, the interior cabin seems cramped. It heats and cools far too easily. The sound of rain plus the inevitable spattering of mist inside the cabin in sideways style rainstorms makes driving this car absolutely <b>no fun</b> unless the sun is out. The Miata is without a doubt, a fair weather friend.

<i>The Looks</i>
This is a sexy, stylish car. I've noticed when driving it that I frequently get a second look. It's not the kind of car that hides itself and as a woman owner especially, I get waves and smiles. Even little kids turn and stare at the car tooling down the street. It's also not the kind of car you want to cheese someone off in as they will more than likely remember you the next time they see you.

<i>Maneuverability</i>
Because of its size, the Miata is highly maneuverable little vehicle. It's good for zipping in and out of traffic, although I wouldn't recommend that for the faint of heart. In this car, you pick your fights. You should always be aware that other drivers may not see you, particularly those in high vehicles such as minivans and SUVs. 

To that end, I recommend keeping your headlights on at all times while you're driving and even investing in air horns. I installed a set on my previous Miata and am considering them for this one as well. Nothing will make someone get back into their lane quicker than hearing what sounds like a Mac truck about to run them over.

Overall, I'm very pleased with my new ride. I enjoy the camaraderie of fellow Miata enthusiasts and I feel that the standard laundry list of shortcomings about this car (no legroom, lack of steering wheel tilts, poor visibility with the top up) are to be expected and they don't interfere with my enjoyment of the car at all.

There are a few things that I wished Mazda would offer standard or as factory/dealer options on this vehicle: a remote keyless entry and trunk opening system with alarm, heated seats and a CD changer in the trunk. Even mid-level cars such as my boyfriend's VW Cabrio come with a standard auto alarm and a cheap and easy-to-install CD changer package.<br><br>
