            Hey GM1 Good job, but you nned a few improvements!The interior is well designed. The back seat is very large for a smaller family car. and there is room for three adults, even if they are crowded.
 The front controls are very well designed. The driver display is not crowded and has a tachometer as well as the other normal meters. The climate and radio controls are easy to use, while the buttons seem a little to large (GM used to make buttons too small, now they do the opposite). The seats are supportive, and hold the passengers well. For this price it is definately the best! There is absolutely no doubt about tha! But wouldn't you rather add 5 g's and drive a Nissan Maxima? Think about it! It's your car, it's your choice! <br><br>
