            I was looking into buying a digital camera for home and vacation use.  I read a multitude of reviews on this site and many others and one camera I kept finding good reviews about was the Olympus D-150.  My wife and I decided to run to a couple of stores to see what we could find and *surprise* we found the D-150 at Best Buy.  The clerk we spoke with was very knowledgeable about digital cameras and it wasn't long before we had decided on the D-150 and we haven't regretted our choice one second.

<b>Picture quality:</b> I have had the camera for a couple of months now and have been very impressed by it's quality.  There are enough options to play with so you can feel like a pro without actually being one.  I have yet to take a horrible picture using this camera.  For some examples of pics check out my pics from an airplane at the bottom of this page (http://www.pemiriver.com/digitaldevil/pix.htm) or at my wife's website (http://www.pemiriver.com/muffle69/kitties.htm).  You'll agree that this camera can do a great job.  Besides, for the price you won't find a better digital camera from a reputable company with 2.1 megapixels.  (In laymans terms, the higher the megapixels, the higher quality picture you'll have.)

<b>Ease of use:</b> Fifteen minutes after taking the camera out of the box I was already taking pictures.  The instruction book could use a little revamping, but if you know how to program a VCR, then this should be a snap.  Easy to cruise menu, but some of the features are buried in the menu and you have to hunt.  One of the features I like about this camera is the <i>ability to turn the digital zoom on and off.</i>  I dreaded having to deal with loss in quality thanks to a "closer shot", but was pleasantly surprised to discover this feature is turned off 2 steps into the menu.

PC: No software to load.  Plug in the USB cable and *bingo* you can upload your pics immediately.  Easy as changing your mouse.  We take a majority of our pictures at home so it's nice leaving the camera hooked up to the PC (long cord) and snapping a quick pic and uploading it even quicker.

The only thing we are considering to add to this already wonderful camera is a SmartMedia card with more storage capacity.
