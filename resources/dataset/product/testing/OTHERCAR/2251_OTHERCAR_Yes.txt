            OK so this is not my car, but it is my friends and she let me drive it and all I can say is WOW.  I found myself driving it like a standard.  (which this one wasn't).  What can I say about this car that someone who owns this car dosen't already know?  This car is a dream and is about as quick as one.  My only wish would be that she let me drive it longer.

I was very suprised at how much gas this little car holds.  iwas expecting $16 $20 tops (in canadian) but i do believe that it cost over $30 (it was on empty. 

MY friend has put her own stereo in her car and it really thumps.  So i can't comment on the factory one but i am sure that it is a good one too

A must buy car for anyone  <br><br>
