            The sony mavica is an amazing digital camera, which I use on a daily basis. First it uses 3 � inch disks to store the pictures on so you can take pictures then take the disk out and pop it in your computer or a friends computer and look at the pictures right away! Second you can record up to 60 seconds of video and sound on one disk so you can capture your baby�s 1st walk or get your friend flying around on that cool rollercoaster. Unlike my last Casio camera, you don�t have to put the video together. Tape it then pop it in your computer and there is your video!

It has a 14 x zoom which is the most powerful zoom right now on the market. Makes those closeups very nice to take! Optical is much better than digital zoom.

The only real downfall is the size of the camera. It�s a monster! Its so bulky and big BUT the good thing is that I have taken it to Vegas and Ireland and have never had problems carrying it around so it might be big but you will love it so much you wont notice the size of it in your hands!
