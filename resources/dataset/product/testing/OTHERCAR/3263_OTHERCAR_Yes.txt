             A few years ago about 1996 my husband and I decided that we wanted a nice big car for our family trips. After looking at all of the new cars and the price tags we almost gave up. 
  I had to fly back home in rural IL and the night before I was to fly back my sister and I went into a nearby town for last minute shopping and on the way back to sis's house I saw it. Sitting under a lamp on the car lot was this beautiful car! We stopped and got out to look of course there wasn't any salesman at 9pm but that was ok. Not a scratch on it, tires were great the top was perfect. 
Luckily my dad buys a lot of cars from that dealership. I called my dad and he gave me the dealers home phone number so I called and inquired and was told the price would be $23,000.00 then he asked how I got his home number when I said my dad he lowered it to $18,000.00. It only had 22,000 miles on it.
I called my husband and he thought I was out of my mind so I let it drop and flew home the next morning. My husband met me at the airport and asked about the car I told him it was absolutely beautiful. When we got home he asked me to call my dad and have him go over and look it over. Dad called back and said that if he had the money he'd buy it in a minute.
As you can guess hubby was on the phone and told the dealer not to sell it he was flying out to buy it, sight unseen. And he did just that.
Drove it back to California and we still love this car. We haven't had any major problems with it just the normal hoses and tires. Hubby even built it a carport, (I call it a shrine) and has it washed and waxed every week.

The car is so roomy even the kids can't argue about how's on whose side. I had a foreign exchange student from Japan staying with us and her and all of the others with her took pictures of the car.
The only bad thing about this car is that it is so big that the AC doesn't quite reach the back seat, wish they had put a vent back there. It has everything else power windows,seat, Temp. control, tilt steering ,cruise and much more.

 It has a very powerful V8 engine, automatic transmission and gets 18 miles per gallon in town 22 highway miles.
The car is sealed so well that with the windows rolled up you can't hear any outside noise.
Even the factory stereo is good, not great, but good it came with a Cassette/AM/FM radio with a reciever .
The clock even works in this car after you figure out how to program it.
The car also came with a cassette tape to explain all of the features and a leather organizer that hold the car manual and repair records.
 The leather seats are an added bonus. Easy to keep clean and both front seats have several controls to find your comfort zone.
