            I am a car driver so when it comes to SUV's or Truck's I pass, but this time it's different. BMW well known for superb sport sedans get's into the popular SUV race with there new BMW X5 SAV. The Sport Activity Vehicle, at first site this vehicle is all BMW. From the kidney grill to the beautiful roundels that reminds you that this vehicle is built around the &quot;sport&quot; and &quot;fun&quot; aspect. As soon as you open the door, you know that this vehicle is a special vehicle. A door that opens and closes with a solid heavy &quot;thunk&quot;. Step inside and you're treated to the familiar BMW Sport Luxury treatment. I've always had love for BMW's special ways of treating their interior and the materials that belong in the vehicle. I would describe it as almost intimate, press the stereo switch and it feels as though it was made of a special material to make you feel good every single time you press it. Insert the key, turn the key, and listen to the 4.4 liter V8 engine come alive.Step on the gas pedal and rev the engine. A beautiful growl comes from the stainless steel quad exhaust. Now shift down to Drive and step on the gas, feel the steering wheel as it feels connected to the road. That weird tingly feeling from the steering wheel, often found on the great sport sedans and coupes is present here as well. Driving is a treat, turn left, then right. Stable and sharp. The road noise is almost non existent. The ride pleasurable, but a little rough through grooved roads. While driving it at 90mph, I ask myself. &quot;Can this be? Me the man who owns and loves is 00 M5, falling in love with a SUV?&quot; Then I correct myself &quot;This vehicle is a SAV, the only one of it's kind&quot;. This tall, bulky, SUV looking vehicle was a joy to drive. Having you yelling &quot;yeah!&quot; every once in awhile. I pull back into the dealership and get out. I look upon the vehicle and questioned myself. &quot;Should I?&quot; &quot;Hmmm?&quot; I thought back to the 90mph on a s-curve and yell &quot;Put me on the list&quot; &quot;Uh for my wife of course!&quot; There you have it my first time with the BMW SAV and I come out respecting it. There are only a few complaints. The cargo space is so small, I myself fitting more into my M5. The ride is rather rough on certain pavements. The 19 sports wheels looks nice, but causes this rough ride. This vehicle is pretty thirsty gas fills come and go in a matter of days. Finally the cost is pretty high compared to vehicles in the same nature. Options help with the luxo factor, but price adds up real quick. Other than these few complaints, this vehicle is &quot;The Ultimate Driving Machine&quot;.<br><br>
