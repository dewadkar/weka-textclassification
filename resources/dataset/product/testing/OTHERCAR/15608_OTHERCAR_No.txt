            I'm a news reporter/photographer and I've been using this camera quite a lot lately.  Here's the Pros and Cons;

The Pros - It feels like a camera, and that's important.  You want a good weight which will give you stability and confidence in the machinery you're holding.  Lighter isn't better. 

After taking a shot you can review what it looks like right on the adjustable screen.  This is useful, because at the highest resolution, you can only take approx. 8 pictures per disk - so, if one is bad, get rid of it to make more room.

It has a decent zoom feature which is made even more useful by the &quot;Steady Shot&quot; feature which stabilizes an image at 30 yards.  

Even though it's purely &quot;bells and whistles,&quot; the camera has a &quot;movie&quot; function which will record a 5 second mini-movie, or greeting, or something, which you can then playback either on the camera or on your pc. Come to think of it, this feature really doesn't have that many applications, but its still neat all the same.


Ok, now for the bad news.  The biggest problem is that you can't adjust the shutter speed.  For example, I took some photos of an elementary school basketball game recently, and half the shots were blurry, simply because the action was too fast.  I was left frustrated at what would have been an awesome shot with a &quot;normal&quot; camera.  Also, despite all the talk about &quot;high resolution&quot; (and I don't care how much you pay, or how many gigs you squeeze on a print)digital cameras just don't cut the mustard.  You can't beat film.

So, overall, its fun to play with, but if the job is really important, go film.
