            We finally broke down, and my wife and I decided that it was time to buy a new car. I'll make this epinion straight and to the point. I love my 2000 Honda Accord Sedan! I tested 6 imports before buying the car: the Accord sedan and coupe, Camry and Solara, Maxima, and Galant. The Accord sedan wins hands down for value. The Maxima we were looking for was the SE w/ leather seats and it was too expensive. I'd choose Acura TL instead of the Maxima as they are so closely priced. Camry's suspension is too soft for my taste. Solara is not so bad, but the style turns me off. Galant, hmmm, it still feels cheap inside.

   The Accord wins for value test. The car came fully loaded with leather seats, moonroof, CD player, etc from the factory. In fact, I didn't buy any optional equipments from the dealer and it makes the buying process very simple. It, however, is not a perfect car as it is. The workmanship is somewhat in lower quality compared to my 95 Accord LX and 98 Civic. There are more hard plastics on the dashboard and door panels, the fitment is somewhat imperfect as well. What the car shines over the old ones are the handling, engine and transmission quality. Transmission shift is still not nearly as smooth as Toyota's, but is still a huge improvement over the old car. The engine is powerful and only requires 87 octane. Handling is typical Honda where the suspension movement is taut and controlled. The ride is also on the firm side. Big room inside with nice seats, front and back, but the driver's seat can have more lateral support. The car is reasonably quiet for cruising on the interstates at the speed excess of 80 mph.

Overall, this is the best car I have ever owned. My little brother who works as a maintenance man at a local dealership actually likes the car and we never agree on anything. So I guess that explains the corny title :)
