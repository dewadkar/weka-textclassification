            No kidding.  The fall '99 introduction of the new 2000 Infiniti I30 (and I30t) effectively rendered the Lexus ES300 totally obsolete.  In fact, as of the end of March, 2000 the I30 was outselling the Lexus ES300 by 18%, nationwide in the US.  Ready? ...Here's the &quot;kill&quot; list:

-10 more cubic feet inside the passenger compartment (can you say LIMO?)
-2 cubic feet more trunk space (twice the size of your monitor)
-227 horsepower
-217 ft-lbs of torque
-Best warranty in the ENTIRE luxury car industry
-105,000 miles of maintenance-free driving
-Awesome bose CD &amp; tape sound system with dedicated rear woofer
-Leather is standard equipment
-Power everything (standard equipment)
-Auto down (and UP!) front windows (standard equipment)
-60/40 split folding rear seat (standard equipment)
-Active headrests (standard equipment)

...Not enough for you?  Just take my word for it and go drive one.  5 minutes (or less) in an I30 will convince you that the Lexus is not even in the same league as this car.  The biggest difference between the Infiniti and the Lexus is that while they are both luxurious, the Infiniti actually handles [very] well.  The ES300 is truly a glorified Toyota Camry (feels just like one on the road), but the I30 is a GENUINE sports/luxury sedan.

In Luxury trim, the I30 is as smooth as the ES300, but it's a LOT more fun to drive.  In Touring trim (I30t), it handles like a sports car!  227hp gives this car plenty of get-up-and-go --trust me.  The engine loves to rev, and if pushed, it responds with vigor.

This car really has dual personalities.  At one end of the scale, it is a very luxurious, stylish, roomy, comfortable and sedate family sedan.  It is just perfect for the growing family, as it has a colossal trunk, piles of rear-seat legroom, 60/40 split-folding rear seats, three child-deat saftey anchors on the rear parcel shelf, and enough cupholders for everyone. (Two 12v power outlets too!)

At the other end of the scale the I30 loves fast, twisty roads and it adores the passing lane on highway.  Floor the pedal and the engine comes to life, thrusting you forward with gusto.  Abundant passing power is only a quick stab at the accelerator away at all times --even when doing 65 on the freeway.

...Have kids? There's enough room for ALL their stuff --and yours too.

...Retired? Want a luxurious and reliable car to speng your golden years in? The I30 is all this and much more.

...Single guy/gal?  The I30 is as stylish as it gets, and the I30t is very sporty, both in it's appearance and outstanding performance.

Perhaps you are just looking for the best overall value in the $30K price range?  At a base sticker price of $29,990 (includes all the above mentioned standard equipment), the I30 simply cannot be beat.  Sure the Acura 3.2TL is around the same price, but it lacks the style, panache, superb warranty, and award-winning customer service/satisfaction of the Infiniti.  The Lexus ES300 has a base price of $31,900, and that does NOT include leather ($1,800), 60/40 split-folding rear seats, sunroof, etc.

I know this ends up sounding like an Infiniti advertisement, but let's face it: it really is the best car out there for around 30 grand.  Stop by your local Infiniti dealer and drive one.  You'll be pleasantly surprised when you find out it really is all that I promise and more.  Just bear one thing in mind:  The I30t (Touring) is not for everyone.  It is VERY sporty, and provides a very firm ride --just like a sports car.  The I30 luxury model (the cheapest model) is the one with the smoothest ride.

My qualifications:

I am a senior Sales &amp; Leasing Consultant for Infiniti, and I am Infiniti-certified on the entire Infiniti car line.  I know this car inside and out, backwards and forwards.

I am also a published and respected freelance automotive journalist.  This opinion really is an objective one.  I simply love this car!  No kidding!  The Lexus is a great car, but it simply doesn't measure up.  The Acura is also a great car, but stylistically, it's more than a little plain-looking (the rest of the automotive press seems to agree with me here, by the way).  Also, Acura is not exactly famous for it's customer service, and they do not give you a loaner car for anything (trust me --my last car was an Acura and it was in the shop several times for OEM defects).

You might be wondering... what do I drive? Currently, I own a 1994 Pontiac Bonneville, which I bought new.  I am about to purchase a used Infiniti Q45 or J30 (undecided which one I want more at the moment).  My last car was a leased (thank god) Acura 2.2CL.  My previous car was a 1995 Infiniti Q45, which I would still own had it not been stolen (best car I ever owned --no kidding.  Never had a single problem the entire time I had it.)

Thanks for reading my opinion! :-)<br><br>
