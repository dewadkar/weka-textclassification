            In 1988 I bought my first Toyota LE for about 13,000. It was a beautiful white little car that handled like a dream. It was the first new car I had bought having lived in Chicago for years and being able to take the subway everywhere. That thing lasted for 8 good years through thick and thin and through all those horrible Chicago winters. I was a single mother with boys. The interior was tough and took all their dirt without showing.  

When my sons started driving, we bought another white Toyota Corolla because we had loved the other one so much. I had remarried by them, and my new husband and I wanted something new. The boys took the old Toyota and finally beat it to death after we let them have it at 100,000. But it took them awhile.

The second Toyota suffered through two grueling Michigan winters getting stuck only when 13 inches of snow stopped her. That was my fault. She always turned over. She never had a single problem as long as we maintained her well. And even in 10&quot; of snow she moved right through it. At 13&quot; any car would get stuck.

We sold that when we moved to California, but the minute we got to Palo Alto, we bought a brand new 2000 Toyota Corolla for $15,000 and this time we got the new Teal color. I love the new color. It turns all different in different shades of light. She runs well, as usual, and I can run her at 80 so smoothly on these wonderful, wide California freeways.

What I have always liked most about the Corolla is that it is a good car for short people. Both my husband and I are short, but we have no problem adjusting the seat belts or seat positions for ourselves. We had this problem with big American cars which are all made for 6 footers. We think this Corolla is going to last forever in the mild California weather. We've loved all our Toyota Corollas and are loyal, repeat buyers.<br><br>
