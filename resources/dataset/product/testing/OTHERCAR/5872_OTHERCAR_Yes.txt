            I bought my 1996 Baretta in 1999. It was the newest car I had ever purchased and I was excited from the start. I paid $7600 for a 3 year old cherry red, sporty looking car with only 30,000 miles. And let me tell you, that car was worth every penny.

I drove it cross country, from Wisconsin to California and back again, without one problem. It was smooth driving and comfortable the whole way, even over the rocky mountains. On my way back from California, the sporty 2 door held every item I owned in the world, my hamster, and my mom! Pretty good room for a 2 door coupe. 

The gas mileage was impecable. I could fill up (aprox 15 bucks) and it would last 2 weeks with average in town driving. Easy.

The handling in the winter was phenomenal. I had ABS brakes and they worked like a charm. I avoided many accidents in the Wisconsin slippery snowy winters.

My one and only complaint with this car was the alternator. I went through 3 alternators in 3 years.But, with all the great things the car offered, it seemed a small price to pay. 

I recently sold my Baretta (I got $3000 on trade for a 7 year old car!) in favor of a 1999 Dodge Avenger. Needless to say, I miss my "old faithful" It never let me down.
