            Hi .... I used an SLR most of my life but grew to hate carting all the heavy lenses and stuff around.  Decided to go digital and found this wonderful Sony Mavica FD91 with a powerful 14x lens.  It was light weight compared to my SLR.  

From the moment I opened the package this camera was easy to use.  The photos are great.  I am careful to really assess the lighting and have not had a poor photo yet.  Like most camera flashes you need to be rather close to have a good photo.....but I have done very well in low light areas.  

I love the &quot;free&quot; floppies I pick up .... mail in rebates make the floppies free.  They are always available.  I love being able to see the photos 5 seconds after taking them and voiding out the ones that I don't want to keep.  I upload photos on Shutterfly or Ofoto and send them to my friends....quick and effortless.  I took a beautiful photo in our backyard and edited it on Microsoft Picture It!, making it into a fabulous watercolor-like print.  WOW was that fun!  THE ONLY THING I HATE ABOUT THIS CAMERA IS THAT A NEWER MODEL WITH IMPROVEMENTS IS COMING OUT ONLY A MONTH AFTER I PURCHASED THIS CAMERA AND I COULDN'T RETURN THIS ONE.  I don't really care that much.  It's a great, great camera!

This is a perfect camera for everyone!  <br><br>
