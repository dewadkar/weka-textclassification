            Digital Cameras are the craze!  We all want one to simplify our lives.  But what features do we need in a camera to do just that... simplify.  Or rather, simplify and get the most for your money.

The worse thing you can do is waste your money.  Ignore features that you don't really need.  When I purchased my Mavica I was amazed by the movie feature.  You are able to record a short (about a minute) movie including sound!  I still think it is pretty spectacular.  The question remains, is it worth it to add that feature?  I've had the camera for about 4 months and I have not found a reason to use to movie feature in a productive manner.  It has no point other then to give you something cool to play with for the first week after you buy the camera.

You pay for the movie feature and miss out on other options like zoom.  While zoom isn't really important in my case it is a feature that I think I would find more handy for the price.

The main reason I purchased the Sony is the same reason I love it though.  It allows you to save your photos to a portable universal media, the 3.5&quot; disk.  Many cameras have limited space on flash cards that you can only upload to your computer or buy a $300 unit to read the cards.  Everyone has a floppy drive.  So you can take and view your photos practically anywhere there is a computer.  No special software or wires needed.

So as I believe that Sony makes the most convenient camera, I would weigh my options through other Sony models.
