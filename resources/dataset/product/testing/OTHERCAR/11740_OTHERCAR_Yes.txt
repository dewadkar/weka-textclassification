            We bought our 1996 Dodge Caravan in December, 1995.  Prior to that we had a 1992 Dodge Caravan.  The 1992 one we traded in for this one and it had over 170,000 miles on it and was still going.  The 1996 Caravan we have now has 173,000 on it and running perfectly.  I use to van for carpooling and I also do craft shows, so the room in the van is very helpful.  We just take the two back seats out and I can carry anything.  It's been great for my kids also.  Each one gets their own spaces so there are no problems.  The caravan has also moved my daughter from dormitory to apartment several times.  It gets about 24 miles to the gallon and I just love the smooth ride it gives.  The only problem we have had so far is that the alternator went out, I think that's a pretty good track record.  I would not recommend to the family with a teenager.  My son is 16 and refuses to drive the van saying it's for old folks.  I hardly disagree although he insists no self-respecting teenager would drive a van.  I highly recommend the Caravan to anyone and I can assure you that my next automobile will be a Caravan also.<br><br>
