            I purchased a 1997 Dodge Neon in August of 1997, it already 18,000.
miles on it but I wasn't concerned with that. After I had driven it for no 
more than a month I had to take it back to the dealership because of
the brakes, they made the most awful squealing noise, I had it
back to the dealership 3 times, they also managed to break a ball bearing and I had to wait 3 days before I could get my car back. The brakes 
still squeak but I'm told by more than one mechanic that it's O.K.
because of the material they use.

Problem 2: After my mileage reached 30,000. I had to have a new transmission put in, Dodge paid for the transmission but would not pay for the rental car I had to get because I didn't have an extended warranty. I called their help line, and was basically told that it was too bad that they sold me a car with a lousy transmission but they were not going to pay for my rental car. I will never buy another Dodge
vehicle again, I feel that they don't back up their product and don't seem to care about their customers.<br><br>
