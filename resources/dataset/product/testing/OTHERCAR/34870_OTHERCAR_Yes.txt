            If you can afford the Odyssey, buy it.  There is no other minivan that can meet its standards.  It is literally a spaceship because no other manufacturer has met it's standards, but Toyota is close.  I bought a Nissan Quest in '97 and my uncle bought a brand new Odyssey and let me tell you is there a difference.  Although my van was about $6,000 cheaper than his Odyssey I wished the Odyssey was out in '97. The revving 210 horsepower engine is nice for those occasional needs of extra power.  The interior room is huge, not to mention the big &quot;ditch&quot; in the van to store extra stuff.  The Odysssey is built with the reliable and up to date technology of Honda.  If you look at the interior of my Quest and compare it to the interior of the Odyssey man is there a differnce.  Quality is what the Odyssey has.  And the Odyssey also has a very good resale value.  If you're looking for a real minivan and you can afford to pay a little extra take my advice and buy the Odyssey.<br><br>
