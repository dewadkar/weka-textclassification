            I got the car back in 10/95 and I am the original owner of the car. The car now has 80k on it and it has not really given me any problems. I am averaging 27mpg with mix city and highway. I drove from Buffalo to NJ last month and it still averaged 35mpg. The body is very rust-proof and I don't see any rust after spending 6 years in Buffalo NY. I washed it once a week when it was snowing. The factory sound system is great with 6 speakers.

I think I have spent about 1500 on repair and maintenance in the last 7 years, which is not bad. Timing belt replacement cost me 600. It will also soon need a new brake master cylinder. But I still have the original AC Delco battery on the car.

Warped rotors are super difficult to replace on this car. You have to remove the whole steering knuckles and the hubs to take the rotors off. It is a full day work for me to get them off and replace them. It is a 1 hour job on other cars. Oil filter is located in the back so you have get under the car to reach it. The auto transmission is not as smooth as Toyota Camrys or on GM cars. The steering wheel shakes a bit when it is idling. A/C is not very cold even when the car was new. The power window on the driver side is getting slower and slower. The car also seems to be very senitive to imbalanced tires and steering wheel will shake when there is any imbalance on the tires drining on highway. The backseat space is small comparing to Camrys. The ride is not as smooth as American cars. The 4 cyl engine has OK power. And there is an annoying "exhaust A pipe" buzz comes at around 1800rpm.
