            We bought this car about 1 1/2 years ago when we were expecting our first child (the typical Volvo wagon story).  There were several reasons we chose this car.  We had started out looking at entry-level $30,000+ luxury sedans such as the Mercedes C230 and BMW 323i but those are compact size cars and we felt our growing family needed a bigger car.  We briefly considered getting an SUV but since we commute 80 miles per day it wasn't cost effective and since we live in Southern California we really couldn't justify getting one.  A minivan was never in the picture at that time because we didn't see ourselves driving one.  (However, after being a mom for 16 months I am now in a better position to appreciate a minivan, especially one equipped with a video system!)  My Massachusetts in-laws had driven Volvo wagons for years so my husband was personally acquainted with their durability.  Volvo's reputation for longevity and safety are what persuaded us to get one.  Since we already had a sedan, we decided to get a wagon so that we have the versatility to easily haul large items.

We bought a base V70 with automatic, leather interior, CD player, homelink, and power driver's seat.  What we like:  The V70 is a very comfortable car.  The front seats are roomy and comfortable.  The leather interior is luxurious and easy to clean.  The sound system is really nice, especially with CDs.  The power driver's seat has 3 memories so you can easily reposition your seat after your spouse changes it.  The homelink system is located on the back of the visor takes the place of your garage remote control.  You program it by holding your remote up to the panel on the driver's visor and then you don't need your remote anymore.  There are roomy bins for storage in the front doors and under the glove box.  The V70 has dual controls for the air-conditioning/heating.  I love this feature since my husband likes the climate cooler than me.  The car feels solid when you shut the doors and it very reassuring to know the Volvo is highly rated for safety.  The V70 comes with seat mounted side airbags for the front passengers.  I have had this car up to around 90 mph on the freeway and didn't know it until I looked at the dash - it is very quiet and solid at high speed.

What we don't like:  The cup holders are not good designs.  The front cup holder slides out of the top of the middle armrest and when you have a drink in it you can't open the armrest to get to your CDs.  It is also flimsy and my husband broke it once.  It cost $50 to replace (and the car was under warranty).  The back cupholders fold out of the middle armrest so they can't be used if there are three people in the back.  From the photos I have seen the cup holder designs have been improved on the newest V70s.  Also, the hazard lights button is in a really bad place.  It is located just below the radio controls so if you are trying to change the radio without looking you easily hit the hazards.  This also has been changed for 2001.

We have not had any problems with our V70 to date.  One front headlamp burned out at ~15,000 miles which seemed early but a new bulb was $15 and my husband changed it easily.  All-in-all, we really like our V70 and hope to get many years out of it.

PS - Buying the Volvo was the most pleasant car buying experience my husband and I have ever had.  We were not highly pressured.  We named the deal we wanted to get and the salesman made it without any back and forth &quot;I have to talk to my manager&quot; bs. They gave us better financing than our credit union offered.  They took our trade-in on the spot and gave us a loaner (an S80!) until our car was ready.  They even sent us a plant afterwards.
