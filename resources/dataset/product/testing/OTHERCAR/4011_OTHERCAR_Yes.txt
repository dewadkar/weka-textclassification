            A while back, I owned a 93 SL2.  Had more problems in the first 30,000 miles than I can to think about.  Also, got blown off by the dealer.  A bad water pump at 24,000 miles and wiper arms falling off were blamed on the way my wife drove the car.  Then one day, I was looking for a mid size wagon.  Toyota and Honda had used ones with many many miles and it seemed the resale price was a bit high.  I swallowed my pride and opened my mind, and visited a Saturn Dealer(not the same one I bought my 93 from).  I was treated like an intelligent human and was shown a very nice 2000 LW2 with only 13,700 miles.  I was leary about buying a first year model.  Some of the reviews were a bit scary.  The price was definately right and my first impressions about the dealer were good, so I decided to take a chance.  
     The car had all the standard features anyone could want and actually the styling wasn't awful.  I did have a problem with the transmission.  It would shift unpredictably and after a month, the infamous red warning wrench light came on.  I returned to the dealer and he said it might be the transmission computer.  Realize the car was 3 years old and only had 13,700 miles on it.  Maybe the previous owner only backed it out of the driveway to get the mail.  This remedy seemed to work for about a week, but again the red wrench light came on.  I again returned to the dealer and was told it probably was a defective part in the transmission.  It would take two days to repair.  They gave me a new ION to drive and sure enough the car was ready sooner than expected.  This time the transmission shifted smoother than I ever expected and four months later it still is fine.  What I noticed most from this experience was the gracious way I was treated by service and sales and the efficient repair.  I could not have asked for better.
     The car performs well and handles as well as anything I have previously owned.  I am now an avid Saturn owner and yes, I would do it again.  The L body cars are really improved over the S body.  I don't feel I am driving a cheap piece of junk, as I did with the 93.  To be fair I also own a 95 SW2 and my son now drives a 86 SC.
