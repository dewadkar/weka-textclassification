            I first looked at a Vivitar digital camera, but the store was out of them and wouldn't have any in until later that week.  As impatient as I am I decided to go with the Polaroid PDC7000.  

When I brought it home I was intrigued with it.  I wanted to learn all I could about it.  It didn't take me long and I was learning.  It's so easy to use, who couldn't learn it.  Then I began taking pictures of everything, including my yard.  I had to see how the pictures come out from the computer to the printer.  Boy was I ever surprised, the pictures were wonderful.  They looked as though they were professionally developed.  

I also love the fact that I don't have to send any more pictures off to get them developed, I can do it with my own computer using the Arcsoft software that came with the camera.  Which also has some wonderful features. I had no problems installing the software for the camera including twain program. 

All in all I love this camera. <br><br>
