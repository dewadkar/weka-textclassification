            I compared this car extensively against it's competitors( Galant, Accord, Stratus) it was the best combination of luxury and performance among them.  The auto-stick transmission shifted smoothly even at high rpm.  Color selection was plentiful.  The only major drawback to it's appearance was the lack of body colored side mirrors, no matter what color you choose, you get black molded mirrors.
The availability of a full size, matching wheel spare tire is a rare treat.  The cab forward design allows for greater cargo and passenger room.  Oddly enough heated mirrors are not available, which I found a bit disappointing.  Overall a very good car.
