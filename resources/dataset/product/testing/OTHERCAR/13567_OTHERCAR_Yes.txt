            Pontiac has made a few inroads into the vehicle market in the past ten years by expanding into areas where it was once a non- player. A few years ago, Pontiac introduced the Montana, a passenger vehicle that was designed to compete with the other minivans that were being manufactured by the competition. And just recently, Pontiac decided that it was time to produce a vehicle to compete in the ever- popular SUV market. That new vehicle is the <b>Pontiac Aztek</b>, a cross between a minivan and an SUV, with the distinct look of a Pontiac vehicle. 

<b>Features/Options:</b>

The 2003 Aztek is available in either front- wheel drive or all- wheel drive, with three possible option packages: ISA (Basic), ISB (Basic Plus), or ISC (Comfort and Security). Many features are standard with all three option packages, like tilt steering wheel, power door locks and windows, air conditioning, power mirrors, AM/FM with CD player, rear window defogger, and many other options that are expected in a modern- day vehicle. The ISB package takes things a step further by adding options like tinted glass, cruise control, and remote keyless entry. The ISC package is the top of the line, offering traction control, a theft- deterrant system, DVD overhead entertainment system, and a few other luxury bells and whistles.  

Aztek is powered by a 3.4 liter 3400 SFI V6 engine that delivers 185 horsepower at 5200 RPM. The transmission is available only in automatic. 

The dimensions of the 2003 Aztek are a little smaller than some of the better- selling SUV's. This vehicle is 5 feet, 6.5 inches in height; 6 feet, 1.7 inches in width; and 15 feet, 2.1 inches in length. The cargo capacity is 45.4 cubic feet with the rear seats in place or 93.5 cubic feet with the rear seats removed. Fuel tank capacity is 18 gallons, and the average miles per gallon are 18/25.

<b>Special Features of This Vehicle:</b>

Aztek is promoted as a Sport Recreation Vehicle. Is that any different from an ordinary SUV? Yes and no. This vehicle fits many of the same descriptions that one would apply to an SUV. But Pontiac decided to add a few more unique features to make this vehicle stand out from the SUV crowd. 

<i>Seating</i>- Let's start with the rear seats. As I alluded to above, the back row of seats can be removed from this vehicle, which greatly expands the cargo space. The seats fold forward, and can be quickly removed without the use of any tools. And they are lightweight enough (just over 40 pounds each), that most anyone can remove and reinstall them with ease. 

<i>Rear Cargo Tray</i>- This is a flat tray that slides out, in the rear of the vehicle, and can hold up to 400 pounds of cargo. This tray also has a hidden storage compartment and a few pop- up storage areas with dividers. With these dividers, you can safely haul items without the fear of them tipping over when you make a turn. This cargo tray can even be removed and carried. It has a handle on one end and wheels on the other, making it easy to transport. You can just roll it along the ground. 

<i>Other Special Features</i>- Aztek has a removable cooler that can hold a dozen 12 oz. cans of your favorite beverage, located right underneath the center console. There's also an optional 10- speaker audio system, molded seats on the fold- down hatch, and built in cupholders in the back. And if you opt for the ISC package, you can select a DVD entertainment system that features a DVD player with remote control and a color monitor that pulls down from an overhead console. 

<b>Pricing/Warranty/Colors:</b>

The 2003 Aztek lists for between $20,000 and $25,000, which isn't too bad for what you get. This vehicle is covered by the standard, 36,000 mile, three year, bumper to bumper warranty with free courtesy transportation and 24 hour roadside assistance. 

Interior colors available on the Aztek include dark gray cloth, dark taupe cloth, or a combination of dark gray/red cloth. If you prefer leather, you can choose between dark gray or dark taupe leather only. There is no gray/red combination with leather. 

To complete the package, Aztek comes in eight exterior colors: Beige, Black, Yellow, Maple Red, White, Victory Red, Gray, or Electric Blue. Not all exterior/interior combinations are available, so you need to check first. 

<b>Final Thoughts:</b>

Pontiac's Aztek is the first vehicle that I have ever heard referred to as a "Sport Recreation Vehicle". This doesn't make it any better than an SUV, of course. It's really just the result of some creative marketing. The product development people at Pontiac wanted to enter the SUV market, but they decided that their entry needed a title that was new and refreshing. So, they created the term "Sport Recreation Vehicle" to replace the more tired, worn- out term, "Sport Utility Vehicle". 

Aztek <i>does</i> offer a unique look and some unusual features that you don't see in many other vehicles of similar style. The appearance, however, might be considered somewhat ugly by much of the public. The front- end has the traditional Pontiac appearance and having this type of look attached to a minivan/SUV vehicle might strike some as a little funny looking. It definitely <i>doesn't</i> have the tough, rugged appearance that you get with a Dodge Durango or a Ford Explorer. Aztek has more of a "cutesy" look to it, along the same lines as the Jeep Liberty. It doesn't really fit the rugged appearance of an SUV, but then again, maybe Pontiac intended it that way. After all, it's really a Sport Recreation Vehicle, <i>not</i> an SUV, right?

The interior features are unique and they will likely help to sell this vehicle, especially to the younger crowd. It sounds cool to have a built in, insulated cooler right next to the driver's seat. But does any vehicle really <i>need</i> an added feature like that? I admit that I like the idea of being able to store a 12- pack of beer right next to my seat, but I could just as easily accomplish the same thing by purchasing a small cooler and placing it in the back seat of my car. 

With the cooler, the speaker system, and the molded seats and cupholders, Aztek would be a fun vehicle for tailgate parties. You just flip the back hatch down, turn on some tunes, pop open a few beers, and sit in the molded seats while you hang with the crowd. The only problem for myself is that I live in Ohio, a state where tailgate parties (and most other forms of entertainment) are outlawed. But if I lived someplace else, I can see how this vehicle would have a certain appeal. 

When I drove the Aztek, I rode around in the front- wheel drive model with the ISC luxury option package. The all- wheel drive model is slightly more expensive, but I don't see how it's necessary unless you really think you will be driving on rough terrain or through heavy snow and ice. I found the handling to be smooth without any tilting or tipping when I made a turn. Pontiac could probably work on making the engine just a little quieter, but overall, it was a good ride. 

One thing I didn't like too much was the instrument panel; namely, the red lights on the dark black background. I thought that this contrast in colors was a bit hard on the eyes, even though I admit that it did give it a stylish appearance. I liked the "heads- up" display, a feature that flashes your speed and radio station with a red beam of light, onto the lower part of the front glass panel, right in front of the driver. This is a good safety feature that helps the driver keep his/her eyes on the road. And the cargo space, with the seats removed, is very good. It offers more cargo space than many larger SUV, like the Dodge Durango.

Overall, the 2003 Pontiac Aztek is a nice vehicle. It's name conjures up images of the wild west and of ancient civilizations, but it's really a modern vehicle that's 100 percent Pontiac. The price is fair, for what you get. And with cheap financing in relatively large abundance nowadays, I predict that the Aztek will find it's market and capture a good number of buyers. Its closest competition would include vehicles like the Jeep Liberty, Hyundai Santa Fe, and Ford Escape. Those are all good vehicles in their own right, but they don't offer many of the extra features of the Aztek.

With its unique options and emphasis on fun, the 2003 Pontiac Aztek is a winner for the new year. Head to your nearest Pontiac dealer, and take one for a spin today!
