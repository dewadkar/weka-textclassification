            Although it is one of the most expensive Consumer Digital Cameras on the market, I think it's probably the best one out there! The colors that the CMOS capture device can capture are amazingly true. This camera gives Canon EOS users a path to digital photography without having to invest in all new equipment. I'm using all my older 35mm SLR lenses and flashes! The body feels like a real SLR, and it's not too flashy. With the exception of the LCD display on the back of the camera, there is nothing that could give away that this is a digital camera, unlike cameras like the Minolta Dimage which does not fully look like a 35mm SLR! Although the built in flash cannot replace a hotshoe flash, it's not bad for quick and dirty shots. One other interesting feature that the camera offers is that the focal length of lenses is increased. For instance a 28mm lens is equivalent to a 50mm lens. (Example a lens marked as 28mm is 28mm on a 35mm camera, but on a D30, it's length is modified by 1.6x, since the capture area is smaller.) A good benefit of this is that the camera uses the center portion of the lens which is always the most acurate part of the lens with the least amount of distortion, which saves on having to buy really expensive lenses, for people on a budget (although the price of the body, probably keeps people on a budget away!). Another feature that was almost immediately apparent was that pictures taken with this camera have almost no digital noise (small green and red lines that show up on digital pictures). The focus system on this camera is not as fast as the EOS1 or the EOS3, which is understandable, since this camera was aimed at serious amateurs and not the pros. Canon is supposed to release the Pro version later on in 2001. Overall I highly recommend this camera to anyone considering doing digital photography, especially anyone that owns a lot of EOS compatible equipment.
