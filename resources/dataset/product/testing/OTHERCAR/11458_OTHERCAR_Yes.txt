            I must admit I really hate going to car dealerships and I detest car salespeople almost as much! When I moved to Kansas I left behind the most wonderful driving experience I have ever owned. A Black Acura 3.2TL. That is another review...........

So after arriving here and securing a place of employment my next step was searching for a vehicle. Because of several mitigating circumstances I was very limited in where I could search for a car. I had been relegated to the secondary dealerships. You know the ones that I mean, the type that have some really big guy sitting in a corner named "vito" who decides if you are worthy! He is the same guy who will show up late one night and hook your car to a tow truck if you even think about missing a payment.

After checking out all the lots in town that a person in my situation could actually hope to get a car I finally decided on one that is owned by a well known new car dealership. For anyone in the Wichita area, Joe Self was the dealership which I am speaking about.

Color me wrong, but coming from the East Coast searching lots in the midwest was unusual. People actually purchase American made cars here. So that seemed to be all most had.
I looked inside and out of every car and decided to take a Burgundy Saturn for a test drive.

I must say that I was very lucky that day. When I drove up and Larry, the salesman approached me. I promptly informed him that I was on the lot with money, references, phone numbers, job history and I intended to buy. I told him to ditch whatever pitch he was preparing and just let me look. If he had what I wanted I would be driving away in something in an hour or so. He kinda laughed and said whatever I wanted was fine and he would just go find something to do and I could come get him when I was in need of his help! What a guy.

I checked out the exterior. Call me stupid but yes, I carried my magnet for checking the body for bondo. I looked at the car from all views including laying on the ground and looking at the undercarriage. Then I asked him the pop the hood and start the car for me. I think Larry was not expecting this. After he did those things I looked and listened to the motor. The idle sounded good. No hesitation in the engine, no knocking, no shaking it sounded great. After he turned off the motor I check the belts. I could tell they had been given the ole Armour All treatment. But even so, there did not appear to be any cracks and the tension was good. There was no oil leaking from the valve covers, looked at the underside of the hood. No oil spray there.

  The test drive went well and the interior was in perfect condition. In fact, it was showroom perfect. As I had told Larry, a little over an hour later I was taking her home!

  Now, this is no luxury car. I purchased the SL model. It is a five speed with manual crank windows, nothing "power" about it. No CD player. Only a cassette. It does have different speeds for the wiper blades and a rear defogger. The seats are cloth and not the cushy kind. There are two cup holders in the front console and another in between the seats for larger cups. There is no ashtray but there is a cigarette lighter. You must hook your own seat belt. They are not automatic. There are two air bags and you can adjust the steering wheel. You can access the trunk from inside the car by lowering the back seat.I purchased this car used with 76,000 miles on it. After driving this car for nearly a year and a half I have not had a single problem with it. 

  This car starts right up every time, it even drives well in the snow. It is a four cylinder but what a nice one it is. Now, it does not have the pickup that I was used to. So, don't plan to beat cars from the take off. It is a little slow in this department but it gets AWSOME gas mileage. It has now 93,000 miles and she is one of the best cars that I have ever owned in terms of being dependable. 

  You do have to change the oil every three thousand miles in a Saturn and that can be a little of a hassle but it is worth it. I have had the tires rotated and new brakes put on but these are basic things.

  This model does have a small back seat and not a lot of leg room for large people. All in all, this is a great car that I would advise anyone to purchase.
