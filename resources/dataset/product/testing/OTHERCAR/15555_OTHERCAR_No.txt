            I was put into one of these as a rental car while mine was in the shop for some body work. 

Upon first glance, it was sporty and fun to drive. After I'd been driving a little 4 cylinder Honda Civic for 2 years, the V6 was fun to play with. Ooh! Power! My husband really enjoyed it. 

But when I got to work the first morning I drove it (after picking it up a half hour or so before...) I couldn't get the stupid key out of the ignition! Now, I've had cars with little switches you had to press, some you have to jiggle...This one was NOT coming out. No matter how hard I fiddled, it would not come out. And the confusing part was  that the stereo would stay on after the ignition was killed. It took me about 3 days to figure out that the stereo stays on until you open the door to get out of the car. (For those of you who absolutely HAVE to hear the last few notes of that song you really love, I guess...)

Since I did not feel like having to drive all the way back to exchange the car (too far away...too much trouble), I put up with this ignition thing for over a week. And hated it the whole time. It nearly reduced me to tears several times because I could not get the key out. If you have this problem, SLAM your Alero roughly into PARK. This seemed to help the problem a bit. My husband figured it out. 

Also, the annoying thing about the stereo-- it adjusts the volume FOR you. When you accelerate and the engine revs, it goes up, and when you slow to a stop, it lowers. That drove me nuts. I'll decided when my stereo is too loud or too soft, thank you! 

I was so happy to get back to my Honda. I can't stand GMC.
