            Chrysler Sebring Convertible is one of the nicest looking cars I have ever seen I mean just look at the picture.  My friend owns one of these cars and it is just so comfortable you could probably just sleep in it if you wanted too.  It is pretty fast not as fast as it could be and we always go cruising with it when we are bored.  This car is very nice and a lot of people agree with me this car is amazing.  It is a very smooth ride to it feels like you are traveling on a airplane because it is so smooth.  I suggest if you want a nice convertible go out and buy this one right away it is a winner.<br><br>
