            My car broker friend took me out for my birthday a couple of years ago. When he pulled up in a black Nissan Altima, I thought "hmmm... nice car." Then I got in the passengers side. "AAAAAAAAAAAAah, cushey seats" I said to him. As I look at the burled wood on the dash, the almond colored leather seats and interior with tan accents, I thought to myself "Wow! I'd like a car like this!" As we drove, I asked him "how much for this car" and he told me 12,000 (wholesale price. I thought "Whoa, I may be able to afford this car..." The evening went on and another friend joined us. He got in the back seat and said "ooooooooooo, nice leather seats." We cranked up the CD player and went down to the local mall to catch a movie. The car just "felt" so good. I hate being the passenger in someone else's car, but this was a pleasure. 

We celebrated my birthday then went our separate ways (me still thinking about that Altima.) In the middle of that night I woke up and said to myself, "I have to buy that car!" Now, I am not one who makes snap decisions, but I called my friend in the morning and asked "Will you sell me that car?" He said "Yeah,... you sure picked a good one!" He then went on to extol the virtues of this particular model made by Nissan. Reliable, affordable, nicely engineered, good engine , good tranny, long lasting. So that cinched the deal for me. I bought it!


 I am SO satisfied with this car. I bought my 1999 Altima used 2 years ago and have NEVER once regretted it! It is one of the best purchases I have ever made. 

~The car seats are comfortable. Everyone that gets into the back seat says "this is a Vegas trip car!" 

~It's easy to drive and park. 

~It's easy to get in and out of the car. I have a four door and the extended family and friends always want to take my car when taking short or long excursions. One of the reasons I bought this car was because I have a muscle disorder and it's hard for me to get in and out of cars. This car is easy access for me.

~The car has 40,000 miles on it and it runs like the day I got it. There have been no major repairs. There have been no knobs, trim or ornaments that have fallen off or broken.

~ The A/C works fairly well for a 4 cyl. It takes a little more time to cool the black car down on a hot summer day.

~The cd player is a small problem. My older cd's will skip because the cd player is so sensitive.  

~The engine is not super quiet, but not overly loud. It makes that signature Nissan motor whine that I remember even back to the old Datsun days of my childhood. Same sound.

~The brakes make a clunking noise when applied, but does not affect operation (had it checked). 

~remote key entry/alarm is great, but I have no option to pop the trunk open. (Am I asking too much?)


Overall, Nissan built this one right! I suggest you test drive a new one. They seem to be the best car on the planet, but if you need a reliable used car, buy a 1999 Nissan Altima. Try to find one that is fully loaded. It really adds a lot!
