            We own a '99 M3 and a 2000 323i, each with about 17,000 miles.  We thought we had the ultimate driving machines until our neighbor showed up smiling in a 330xi.  

This model caught me by surprise and had I known about it, we would have waited on one of the BMWs we own.  At the time, I couldn't imagine improving either car, but the 330xi improves on both in my opinion.

First, there's the 4-wheel drive.  It's about as smooth and sophisticated as any I've seen.  It makes a great-handling car handle even better.  There just doesn't seem to be a way to take a corner without remarkable road hugging and a smile I couldn't contain after each turn.  And oooooh, I'd love to take this to the Sierras to ski.  Our cars are nice to drive there, but the purely rear-wheel drive has me out in the snow with frozen hands putting on chains.  And even with chains, the handling isn't great.  I almost bought an Audi A4 just for the 4-wheel drive.  Had I known BMW would come out with it...

And the engine.  I don't know how BMW made their smooth engine smoother, but they did.  Like silk.  They somehow chased the very last remnant of vibration away.  It doesn't have quite the power of the M3 (not many cars do), but it's a thrill and neither the 323 or 328 are.

I'm not too fond of the chrome trim around the side windows (the 328 has it too while the 323 has black trim), but it looks okay in the steel-blue color my neighbor has.  I don't think it would look good in black or dark blue.

For the first time in my life, if my wife were to ask if it's lust she sees in my eyes as I watch my neighbor climb into her car, I'd have to say yes.<br><br>
