            I bought this car thinking I was getting a good deal!! Well I did not! This car has had more problems than any car I have ever seen, that must be why they offer such a long warranty! Everytime you turn around something has gone wrong! I have had the window seals replaced 3 times and still not any change, my air conditioning unit went out when I had 2,000 miles on it, my belts were all loose and make noises. I have a new car and yet feel like I drive a 10 year old car.( always something wrong) To be totally honest, I have had a rental car more in 2 years then my own car! Also, before you buy this product call a car dealer and say you have a hyundai to trade, THEY LAUGH!! I paid 18,000 for my car and tried to trade it in 2 weeks later (cause I hated it) it was booked at $10,500 in excellent condition! Now I know cars depreciate but my goodness $7,500????
So please when you buy a car buy american I am a UAW AUTOWORKERS MEMBER and I learned never buy foreign unless it is BMW or something highly recognized! Thank you for you time. I would be happy to back up my story with all my Hyundai garage reports! I have a stack!!!

  P.S. Insurance on a Hyundai is also more expensive just ask your agent
