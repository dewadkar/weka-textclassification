            The Pontiac Grand Prix GT is sure to please.  The exterior styling is among the most attractive of any car in its class.  Something about this car puts a smile on my face whenever I see it.  With the normally aspirated 200 horsepower version of GM's low tech but extremely reliable 3800 V6, performance is excellent.  The Grand Prix has plenty of power for passing on the highway and excellent acceleration.  The sports suspension gives the Grand Prix excellent handling but can make the ride quite jarring over rough surfaces.  My particular vehicle is equipped with leather seating surfaces, power heated driver seat with power lumbar, head-up display, Bose AM/FM/CD audio system, and power sunroof.

Among the most useful features is the head-up display, which projects a digital speedometer display on to the windshield in the driver's line of sight.  Radio and CD information is also displayed in this area when making adjustments to the music belching out of the wonderful, bass rich Bose audio system.  The head-up display (HUD) is a terrific safety feature.  When coupled with the steering wheel mounted stereo controls, your eyes will never have to look down.  You can play with the stereo as much as you would like without taking your eyes off the road.  I'm amazed this feature hasn't become commonplace on more cars.  Of course, if for some reason you don't like it, it is easily disabled by a dial next to the steering wheel, which is next to a switch which allows you to raise and lower the position of the HUD on the windshield.

As for interior room, the Grand Prix is spacious.  The driver and front seat passenger will have no trouble getting comfortable, although only the driver gets a power heated seat with power lumbar control.  As a 6'2" driver, I can personally attest to the great comfort of the driver seat.  Rear passengers have plenty of room, although the back seat is a bit low to the floor.  A rear seat pass through is provided for large items to protrude from the trunk area.  The pass through consists of two components: an arm rest with cupholders and a storage space, and a locking door which folds down allowing access into the trunk from the rear seat.  Unfortunately, the lock on this folding door is very flimsy and of poor design, but it still gets its job done.

The Grand Prix is a mighty fine car but it has one notable shortcoming: interior build quality.  While nothing major breaks or just falls off, over time the cheap grade of plastic adorning the dashboard and console will begin to squeak and rattle.  The small cover for the 12 volt outlet under the passenger side dashboard snapped off on my Grand Prix.  The turn signal stalk is the antique GM design that has been present in most GM cars for too long now.  If you press down on the top of the dashboard in front of the driver seat, you might hear a rush of air rushing into the foam covered gaps between each layer of the dashboard.  The center floor console does not nicely wrap around the stereo area as it should.  The glove compartment door handle feels as if it will snap off in your hand if you pull too hard.  Thankfully these are minor and typically easy to fix issues with an otherwise nicely made, fun to drive, easy on the wallet automobile.
