            I have got to say that this has been one of the most enjoyable automobiles that I have ever driven. And being from New Hampshire, it one of the few sports cars that you can drive during our long winters. This is due to the AWD system that most SVXï¿½s came equipped with. Though there are a few FWD models out there, they are few and far between. Although I have never owned an SVX, working at a Subaru dealer I have been given the chance to drive them extensively.

The SVX comes with a horizontally opposed 6 cylinder engine that makes 230 horsepower. One of the few drawbacks is that it was only available in a four speed automatic transmission. Anti-lock Brakes are standard on all models and model years. The SVX came in two models: LSi and L. The basic difference between the two models is that the LSi model came with a leather interior and Tape Deck/Radio/CD player. The L model had a cloth interior and Tape Deck/Radio. 16 Inch alloy wheels were standard on all models, but tire size varied with the model year. Just like every other Subaru, it handled the snow like a champ. I drove an SVX for an entire winter with four Bridgestone Blizzak snow tires. I never go stuck and never went off the road.

In the Subaru tradition, reliability is excellent. I have never broken down in a Subaru and the SVX was no exception. Also in the Subaru tradition, maintenance is relatively inexpensive. The only thing that is fairly expensive is that the spark plugs should be replaced every 60,000 miles and there is about 1.5 hours involved in changing them. With the cost of the plugs, it comes out to about $150.00.

I think it is really too bad that Subaru stopped exporting the SVX to the U.S. because I think there was a pretty good following for the car. I would have also liked to the car develop over the years. But I suppose there was probably a good reason for Subaru to take their course of action. Nevertheless, I was sorry to see it go.
