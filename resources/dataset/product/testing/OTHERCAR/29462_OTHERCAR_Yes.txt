                The Jeep Wrangler, in my opinion, is one of the best cars on the market.  Not only is it so different looking from most other cars, it's so much fun to drive!  I wouldn't trade my Wrangler in for any other car on the market.  Also, if you're like me, price is probably a consideration you have before buying a car.  You just don't have the money to pick a car and take a chance.  No, you need the right one.
    You can buy a new 2000 Jeep Wrangler for as little as 14,000 dollars, or if you want everything it has to offer, than up to 25,000 dollars on the SE version. 
    Yeah, so having a soft top is kind of annoying since it gets scratched a lot, and you have to unroll the windows, but if it bothers you that badly you can get a hard top.  Though some people find those a little less attractive, they are easier to take care of.  I especially recommend the hard top, if you are a smoker, since it would be kind of hard to ash out the window when the plastic windows are in the way.
    Basically, the car is so much fun to drive on the road, off the road, in the rain, and even in the snow.  If you are looking for a little sports utility that has a lot of style, and something just downright fun to drive, then the Jeep Wrangler is for you.
