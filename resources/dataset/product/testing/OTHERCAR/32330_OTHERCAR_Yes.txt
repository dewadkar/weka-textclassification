            I bought the EZ200 because I've been looking for a cheap, low-end digital camera for a while and it was a good price duty-free. 

The camera itself is cool, it has 4 megs RAM and a USB connection, and who needs any more than that! No flash though, it'd be good to be able to fill flash.

The supplied software is complete junk, some of the worst I've seen, and the supplied CD only mounts in a few CD drives - I've tried heaps. No Mac support either - even though it's a USB and TWAIN device. What's up with that, Kodak? I've had problems getting the camera to work on 2 different Win98 machines, but it works OK on another Win98 machine and fine on Windows 2000. All up, no points there. 

Kodak provide a 5 meg download of the driver software if you can't get the CD to work, but the process of getting it is involved and painful - it should be a quick click off the product page, not several forms and licence agreements away.

Quality of images is quite good as long as you're not expecting much - only 640x480 but there's a great depth of field and heaps of colour - it's good for taking shots you'd never think to take with a film camera because they mightn't come out. Backlit images look bad though, it overcompensates wildly for any background light - that's where a fill flash would be perfect.

All up, if you can get this working on your machine it's a great little toy. Make sure you buy it somewhere you can easily return to if it doesn't work though.
