            This Range Rover is the best value in the SUV market today. It's old enough that it's depreciated to a reasonable price, and the technology is also old enough to make repairs easy to diagnose.
The view from any seat is like you are in a low flying plane. You can see the whole road, and it's rare that a car gets in front of my that I can't see around it. This makes for a much safer driving experience.
There have been repairs, but they've all been minor, and easy to do with a few wrenches. No special equipment needed! If you enjoy working on cars once in a while it can be a rewarding experience. Parts are inexpensive at www.motorcarsltd.com.
Land Rover owners are fanatics by their very nature. Working on your car is easy, so it makes you feel better about the car you own, and not like a Point A to Point B transportation machine.
Offroading this vehicle is second to only the Hummer, but it is much more comfortable to ride around in.
This year is very reliable because they fixed all the problems, and hadn't started adding gadgets like the air-suspension and electronic traction control.
I would strongly urge you to buy this car in good condition after having a mechanic check it. Happy offroading.<br><br>
