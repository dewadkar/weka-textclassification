              I personally did not buy this vehicle, my step father did.  He likes cars of luxury and comfort.  This convertible is a nice ride and very smooth over bumps.  The break is a little rough and needs to be pushed in with some force to really get the car to break good.  

  The car is roomy and sporty at the same time.  The only downfall that I found with this car is its actual size.  The ride is great but you have to be able to handle a much larger vehicle.  The car doesn't look that big on the outside but when your inside driving you can really tell how big this car is.  It seems to be a very reliable car , for what it costs it should be.  I prefer smaller cars, and the older ones but hey whatever floats your boat.<br><br>
