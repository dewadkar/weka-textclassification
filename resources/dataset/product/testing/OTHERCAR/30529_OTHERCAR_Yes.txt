            Town & Country offer a lot of feature not found in most other minivan. It's the most luxury minivan. (But the new '04 Sienna will beat it).

Examples: Power rear liftgate; 3-zone climate control; beautiful gauges (in LXi & Limited only), very comfy seats, and much more.

What it lacks: Small outside mirrors (smallest of all minivans) and it's not too close so it creates a bigger blind spot than usual; too bad that the most luxury minivan doesn't offer a rear obstacle detection system like the Ford Windstar, GM minivans, and the new Toyota Sienna, and even Honda Odyssey offers it as a dealer-installed option for 2003.

Traction control works at low speeds only (up to 35 MPH I think) while most other has all-speed, but you can get the AWD system, though.

Rear split bench seat not too comfy, and problem is you MUST take it with some packages, or in the LXi model. This should be an option only! Or better fold into the floor. The climate controls are too complicated. The controls for the rear wipers also not the best. Ford Windstar's is smarter. Load capacity is just 1,150 Lbs. smallest in group.

Floor console is almost useless. The Ford Windstar's, or even better the new Toyota Sienna's are much smarter. I also hate that 'info center' above the steering wheel, which shows the signal flashes, high beam controls, etc. etc. it's not nice designed, and mostly blocked by the steering wheel. There is no luxury with that. It should be standard as most other cars.

But in overall it's very good.
