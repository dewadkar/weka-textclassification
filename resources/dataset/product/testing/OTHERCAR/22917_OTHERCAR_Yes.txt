            I have a 1995 Jeep Wrangler Rio Grande, aqua blue pearl coat, soft top and she is beautiful.  I bought this Jeep because I knew how much fun and what a great vehicle it is and it looks and rides much better then a compact car.  I love the ability to take the top down and the doors off on a warm summer day knowing that I don't need an air conditioner I will have the wind whipping through my hair. It is fun to acknowledge the stares of other people in normal cars.  You know they are wishing they had a Jeep too.  People think just because my Jeep has a soft top that it must be one cold ride in the winter and that is not true, because Jeep installs great heaters.  <br><br>
