            I currently own a 1997 M-Edition Mazda Miata, and have had it for about two years.  The M-Edition, for those who are unfamiliar with Miatas, is a model that they put out each year in an exclusive color (in the 1997's, it was Marina Green) with some &quot;extras&quot; inside (rosewood dash panel, Nardi wood shift knob, leather package, premium sound, etc.).

First of all, let me say that I love my Miata.  I had decided that it was time for a new car, and being single with no kids, wanted something a little frivolous.  I looked at the BMW Z3, the Porsche Boxter, and the Miata, and decided that the Miata was the best value for my money.  It was my first brand-new car, and was affectionately tagged &quot;The Rollerskate&quot; within a few weeks of my owning it.  

Miatas look great, are fairly inexpensive to own, and are all in all great little cars.  I've had no major problems with mine outside of a small oil leak that was easily fixed.  Driving it is a lot of fun -- it handles well, corners easily, and has pickup and &quot;zippiness&quot; to spare.  The Miata handles and rides like most small sports cars; as a matter of fact, it reminds me a lot of the Datsun Z-cars from the 1970's, especially my father's Datsun 240ZX.  For a car it's size, the trunk is adequate, and with the premium sound, the speakers located in each seat's headrest are a major plus; the stereo system features a setting for when the top is closed and when it's open to control where the sound goes.  The top itself is also very easily raised and lowered.  I used to own a Jeep Wrangler, a car with a top that takes at least twenty minutes to take on and off, and vowed that I'd never again have a convertible that took me more than five minutes to flip up and down.

The Miata's not a car for everyone, though.  Now that I'm married and looking at having a family, we've got the Rollerskate on the market.  It's not a very comfortable car when there's someone in the passenger seat, and when that seat's full, you've lost your storage space for CD's, pocketbook, or whatever else you may want to access while you're driving.  The cupholder, a risky place to put a soda when it's just you in the car, is almost impossible to work around when there are two drinks there.  The trunk is also very small for more than one person's luggage.  The Miata also has the same problem of most small convertibles (such as the Z3 or older MGB's), which is the &quot;wind up the back of the neck&quot; effect.  I believe that there is an aftermarket windscreen you can buy that will cut down on that blowing, but it's not something you want to permanently install since they're rather unattractive.  You also might want to think carefully about a Miata if you're over 5'5&quot; or so, since the legroom is on the cramped side.

All in all, the Miata is a fun car.  I'd recommend it primarily to those who are single and/or childless.  And if you can afford to keep a car just for weekend drives when the weather is nice, it's a great option.
