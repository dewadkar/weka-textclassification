            This car is luxurious, yet sensible.  With soft leather seats and wood accents, it gives the appearance of a much more expensive car.  The driver's seat is fully adjustable electronically (forward, backward, up and down) and has an additional lumbar support.  It is particularly comfortable for shorter drivers.  It is very roomy and seats up to 5 comfortably.  Our older Accord only seated 4, so this was a nice addition.  Storage is great with a HUGE glove compartment and additional two-tier console.  Cup holders in the front and back are handy.  CD and stereo sound great.  Handles well...V6 makes acceleration easy and gives you an extra oomph on the highway.  Michelin tires and ABS for bad weather situations.  Automatic moonroof for sunny days and starry nights.  Surprisingly large trunk, but backseat folds down for longer cargo (skis, etc.)  Keyless entry is handy.  Downside:  MPG is lower than Honda's without the V6.  Optional wind deflector is necessary for moonroof if you plan to use it on the highway.

We bought the car after looking at SUV's as we travel quite a bit with our dog and hope to have children soon.  It had just as much passenger room as an Explorer or Jeep, all of the amenities of the two and was a lot less money.  Being loyal Honda owners, we decided to save the extra $10,000 and buy another Honda.  We're saving on fuel and insurance costs too.  Anyone looking for excellent value should buy this car.<br><br>
