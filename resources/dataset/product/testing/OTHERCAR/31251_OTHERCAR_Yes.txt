            I bought a 1995 Pontiac Grand Am in 1996.  As a whole it has been a good car though I do not know if would buy another.  It is fairly large inside for the type of car that it is.  The only problem that I have had with it is repetitive brake changes.  I have had to change the brakes in my car on an average of one time each year.  This is a little extreme as they should last longer than that.  I do love my car aside from that problem.  Have only had one major maintenance problem in the 3 1/2 years that I have had it.  The car is low maintenance.  The gas mileage is good.  The engine does run a little loud so it is not a totally quiet ride.  We took a trip with it cross country and no problems as a whole.  Over all it is a good deal if you can over look the frequent brake replacement and the engine noise. Good family car as far as space goes.<br><br>
