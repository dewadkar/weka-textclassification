            Purchased new in '95, I have driven my stick-shift Tercel in every possible U.S. weather/road conditions in over 220,000 miles, and it still drives strong. Because of some very heavy demands placed on the engine (higher driving speeds, mountain travel, snow, desert, city driving etc.), there have been some oil seal problems, which developed around the 180k mile mark. I also had to have a water pump replaced and brake rotors replaced once. Other than that, it has only needed routine maintenance. Regular replacement of filters, spark plugs, and especially changing the oil & filter at every 3000 miles will keep your Tercel on the road. It's easy for the do-it-yourself people to maintain it. I don't think there has been any noticeable loss of power since I purchased it. There have been NO problems with the AC/heat system, it has never even needed a coolant recharge. Impressive for a car that has been driven mostly in the Southeast.
I do wish the seats were a little more comfortable, but having a $10 lumbar support pad will help. My taller passengers complain of not having enough leg room. Unless you wash and polish the car often, the paint will oxidize (i.e. fade) fairly quickly. I think that is a common negative quality of Toyota. I, too, have had a 'check engine' light that won't go away, even after being fixed... a minor annoyance at worse.
I recommend the '95 Tercel to anyone who wants a car that will last, and isn't afraid of giving up some 'luxury' features. Get yourself a nice stereo system and hit the road!
