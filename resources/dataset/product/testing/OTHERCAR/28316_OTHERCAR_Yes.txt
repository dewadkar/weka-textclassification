            I recently purchased (yes another car).  I traded in my 96 Eclipse :( for this suv.  My Eclipse had 3 bad run-ins (2 accidents and a burglary), so I decided to get something completely different.  I have always like the looks of the Amigo, but never knew much about them.  That was the vehicle I decided to get.

I found one at a great price and I went to check it out and then bought it.  The Amigo just had a new soft top put on it, but that was the only new thing about it.  The truck came with it's problems, all of which are just about fixed.  But that was not the trucks fault, this poor baby had not been well maintained.  I have taken it to be repaired and after another trip she will be good as new.

This did not hinder me from trying to enjoy this spec - "truck" or what ever you want to call it.  This truck has proven to be a pure joy.  When the weather started heating up I took the back top off!!  It was very easy despite the stories I heard about problems people had with it - needing 2 people and the like, I have not found this to be true.  I put it on with ease and take it off the same way.  It folds up very nicely behind the back seats.

Speaking of back seats this truck has a ton of room.  The real test was putting my 6'5" boyfriend in.  He was impressed to say the least.  He's only ever been as comfortable in his Toyota Tacoma.  I've had 4 grown adults sitting comfortably.  I have also folded the back seats down to cram the truck with beach balls.  The space is amazing.  Average grocery shopping fits very nicely behind those back seats.

I will say that the 25 (+/-) gallon gas tank is killing me right now.  I get about 300+ miles out of a complete fill up.  And that is mainly regular street driving.  But still, it's a lot to have to spend at the pump.  I don't know if that situation is ever going to change, but I'm not giving up my Amigo just for that reason.

So far, for the price I've paid and the money I have spent I still feel a little ahead of the game with this one.  The truck has a lot of potential.  The problems that were found only 2 years ago for accessories no longer exists.  I have found many accessories online for the truck.  Hard-tops, soft tops, clear lights, you name it.  I am looking forward to the final repair and getting started on saving money for some phat accessories!!
