            I bought my 1999 SC2 3-door coupe January of 1999. As far as price goes it was priced very well. I had looked at other cars like the Honda Accord and the Toyota Corolla and a few others, but something caught my eye about the SC2. Well that was a year and a half ago. In this time I have been able to get rear-ended, have a friend clear a trail through some trees, and become close friends with a curb at 45 mph. In all that the car has held up well. When I was rear-ended in august of 1999 it was with a full size Chevy truck. I was sitting at a stand still in rush hour traffic, he never hit the brakes. It was estimated he was doing about 35-40 mph when he rammed in to me. They had to tow off his truck, since the front of it was so smashed the bumper was pinned to the front tire of his truck. I was very suprised when I looked at the back of my car and saw only scuffs and a small bump on the bumper cover. I ended up driving away, Saturn had the car 2 weeks to fix it, it ended up costing $3200 which his insurance paid. Can't even tell it has ever been hit. In march 1999 I was going down a feeder when I had my right front tire blow out, well the tire, the rim, and half the suspension came off the car, we still can't figure that one out. that came out to cost me $1600 and Saturn still refuses to admit to the fact that my car had a faulty sub-frame under it. Well almost a year later the same thing happened to me only this time i was not hardly moving, but still cost me $1300, another new sub-frame. this time I had them show me the one that had been damaged, from what I and my mechanic saw, there is a major flaw in the design, ALL the suspension ties into the side of this frame piece which makes it very vulnerable to any type of side impact. Other than the suspension issue the car has been great. I have already put 38,000 on it and it require very low maintenance. Now try calling the customer service dept. in Tennessee, thats a joke, so far Saturn has not been willing to even consider a slight investigation into my sub-frame/tire issue, which this car came with Firestone tires which seem to do the same thing that Ford Explorer tires do when they go out. But the new Pirrelli tire that I spent a fortune on are great and they look better on the car than the other did. I have enjoyed the car and just love to see the look on other people's faces when they see the 3rd door in action and ride in it and ask if it is a 6 cyl. and when I tell them it is only a 4 cyl they are shocked. On a strange note, they keyless entry button tends to set off alarms around when pressed in a busy parking lot from time to time.<br><br>
