            I wanted a larger vehicle that we could fit our three teenagers comfortably. We should have brought them with us to pick out the vehicle. 
I have had no trouble with the feel of the ride but the space inside and the fact that we are stuck in this high priced tuna can is depressing. The teens are 5' to 6'2 and they have their knees in my back most of the ride. Its also hard to get out of the back seat as well with long legs. The front seat is almost as bad. We have to put the front seat back in order for me to have room in front for my legs I am 5'7 making it worse for the back seat riders. 
The breaks are nothing to write home about on this vehicle either, we are always taking it to the shop to have them looked at only to hear that they are fine. But they don't feel fine! 
Cornering has been ok with it in town anyway. We do often get squeaks with the ride but the radio pretty much covers that. With the price of gas these days the mileage isn't that great either. A lot of the items on the dash are out of reach the ash try for one. The lighters are very hard to find at night. The one larger cup holder in front is ok for the most part but in taking a corner both the driver and passenger best hold on to the cups or they may wear the contents. The latch on the center console is very hard to open when driving and sticks often. Its great as the arm rest but you need to be double jointed to get in to it due to the direction it opens from.<br><br>
