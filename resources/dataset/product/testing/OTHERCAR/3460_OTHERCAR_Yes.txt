            If you want a true racing driving machine and you have the money to pay for it, go for an M3 or an S4, however, if you're looking for the best car for $30,000, you can't beat the Acura CL Type S. 

The negative facts first. The 2001 Acura CL Type S doesn't come in a stick, although the 2002 is rumored to come with a 6 speed late 2002 spring. The car is much bigger than its competitors, both inside and in its driving feel. It really does look like the Accord Coupe from the side. The rear seat doesn't come down, which I think is retarded.

When I was looking to buy a car, I was comparing the CL to the 2001 BMW 325Ci, 1999-2000 BMW 328Ci, 2001 Audi A4, and the 2002 Maxima SE. When outfitted similarly to the base appointments of the CL Type S, none of them are close to the CL's price. The 2002 Maxima SE was a tempting alternative since it has the 6 speed, 255hp, and the navigation option. However, all the competitors were priced around $35,000 and up, including the decked out Maxima.  There was no way I was going to pay over $30,000 for a Nissan Maxima.

I drove the CL and played with the manumatic and thought it was fun enough when I wanted to race but since I bought the car, I find myself using it only 20% of the time. The little gadgets are all useful and I can't think of anything that I'd want that the CL doesn't already have.

DRIVING IMPRESSIONS:
It is really fun to drive when the manumatic is used. The engine really growls and the high revving engine doesn't quit. However, when the automatic is used and the gas is gently pressed, the car behaves like any Acura, smooth, quiet, and compliant. The steering is very Honda-like which is to say a bit numb but still very good. It holds the road well but begins to skid a bit on 60 mph tight turns. Braking is very good at the limit but it's a bit slow to bite initially and you sometimes feel like you have to keep pressing more and more to finally get the stopping power you need.  But I'm talking about RACING around the neighborhood.  When put under normal driving conditions, it shines.

INTERIOR:
It really grows on you.  Each feature is very functional and has a gadgety feel to it rather than a luxurious feel.  I mean it in a good way.  You feel like you're driving a spaceship in a way.  The leather is sumptuous, the dash is clear, easy to read and styling.  The A/C, stereo layout is very easy to reach and use.  Even the middle armrest slides forward which I like to use.  There's plenty of room in the back for even a tall passenger although they may feel a bit claustraphobic on the headroom if they're tall.  The middle hump in the back is a lockable storage area good for illegal drugs of all kind. :)  No one complains about rear room surprisingly.

EXTERIOR:
It looks like the cross between a 90's Ford Thunderbird and a Honda Coupe, which I think is right for a certain personality type and luckily I fit the type.  It's clean, sporty, yet elegant exterior belies the engine underneath and I feel a bit like a 10th degree jujitsu master who can kill someone with a stroke but behaves with utter class and gentleness.  The front headlights are large and bold.  The side lines are long and clean and the 3/4 view from rear is sleek with the rear windshield's tilt angle perfectly slightly different from the Honda so you think, hmm, what is that exactly?  The spoiler helps if you're looking for the young sporty look, the no spoiler is great for a more refined look.

FINISH AND FIT:
There's not a rattle or bump or anything wrong with it.  I love it to death so far.  I at first thought the materials could be better in the plastic but it's a small cost to save so much money on such a great car.

CONCLUSION:
If you're thinking about buying a decked out Maxima, Camry, Avalon, Millenium, or some junky American V-8, get the TL Type S.  If you're thinking about a BMW 3-series, Audi A4, CLK 320, or Lexus I300, forget about it and get the new 2002 Acura CL Type S if it comes with a stick or save a few thousand more and get the 2001 Acura CL Type S.  I'm so happy with it, I should be a spokesperson for it.

BUYING ADVICE:
I bought mine used for $25,500 w/ 4050 miles on it.  That was a savings of over $4,000 since it had some tinting and Teflon coating work done on it.  I recommend buying a slightly used one (under 10,000 miles) because the warranty is good until 4 years/48,000 miles even if bought used.
