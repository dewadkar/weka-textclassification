            When I went to the dealership, I was planning on purchasing a Pontiac Grand Am, 4 dr. Then I saw it. They hot fire red color, that sleek sexy panel :) not to mention it was 1/2 the price of the Grand Am. I paid $5500 for the car and dont regret it. That thing is a monster. It's a 92 and I beat the hell out of brand new cars, plus girls love it :) and it's really roomy for a 2 dr. This is a young person's car and even if you aren't this car will make you young. <br><br>
