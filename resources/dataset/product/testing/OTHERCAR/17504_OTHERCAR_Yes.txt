            Having a large family (four kids and a dog), we really needed something roomy, especially since we're talking teenagers.  The 1998 Plymouth Voyager we bought new two years ago has worked out just fine.  List price at the time was under $20,000 and fit right into our budget.  The V-6 engine supplies plenty of power yet it gets pretty good gas milage. We got the model with two sliding passenger doors and I highly recommend this to anyone with half grown kids like ours.  My wife stands about five foot tall in her stocking feet and she's able to see over the steering wheel in the van where it was difficult for her in the Olds 98 we had before.  The only draw back is the fact that there is no room for suitcases etc. when going on long trips.  A car top carrier took care of that problem.  We have had this van for over two years now and put 40,000 miles on it and have had no problems whatsoever.
