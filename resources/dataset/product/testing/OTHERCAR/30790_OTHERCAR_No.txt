            I was thoroughly pleased with my Olympus 340R until the batteries started to drain quite rapidly last month (10 months after I bought it). Then suddenly the camera just died. I returned it to Olympus for repair since it was still under warranty. They claimed sand in the lens had caused the camera to stop working although this diagnosis didn't fit the symptoms. (Not to mention the fact that I was nowhere near sand and the camera was handled and stored quite carefully.) They wouldn't honor the warranty and wanted to charge over $100 for the repair . (My brother has the same camera and was experiencing similar problems of extremely rapid and intermittent battery draining.) I am quite disappointed in Olympus' handling of the problem. While I thought the Olympus performed superbly while I had it, the fact that it only worked perfectly for 11 months and that Olympus wouldn't stand behind its product, will certainly stop me from buying an Olympus again<br><br>
