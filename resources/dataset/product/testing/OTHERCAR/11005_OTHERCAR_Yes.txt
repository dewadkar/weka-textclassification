            We have three small children and felt our Toyota Station wagon was too small and cramped...with the German shepard that we have to put in the back as well.  So, we bought a 1994 Astro Extended van.  What do I like? There is plenty of room to move about, lots of storage compartments and pull down tables with cup holders.  There is ample seating for 8 adults plus plenty of storage in the rear for luggage and/or a large dog.  We travel often and have not had to use the roof rack yet.  There is also wonderful amenities including a CD player and rear AC/Heat controls.  Many little lights to direct to individual people.  We keep the oil changed every 3000 miles and there is almost 90,000 miles on this vehicle.  It also has wonderful doors in the back, a glass window that opens up and two swing out doors, making it very easy to just open the back window and put in all my groceries with room to spare.  It has been relatively maintenance free.

What I don't like?  There have been some engine repairs that pop up, one that cost us $1000.00 and was totally unexpected.  The CD player freezes up in cold weather and won't work for about 15-30 minutes, there is no tape player, and little things seem to break....like once our windshield wipers kept stopping only when it rained!  We finally had the engine replaced for the wipers which also cost us hundreds of dollars.  Right now my right hand blinker works on some days and get's stuck on others...and the left driver window doesn't close completely air tight and there's a bit of noise that comes in when driving at high speeds due to the leak...it's these little things that make it difficult for me to LOVE the van.

The other issue is that it's not sleek enough, not mainstream enough, and quite honestly it's not &quot;mini&quot; enough to fit in - in society (or at least mine), I always feel like it looks like a large &quot;bubble&quot; van, which it really isn't.  It's a cross between a mini and a large van, but it still makes me uncomfortable.<br><br>
