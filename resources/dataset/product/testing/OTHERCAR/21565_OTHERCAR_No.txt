            I asked my friend Inbal how she liked her new car. Her response, "It's okay, I guess." I've never encountered such ennui in response to a new car. Her new car is a Suzuki Esteem GLX. She got hers in a paint color called "Bluish Black Pearl" which is absolutely gorgeous. Still paint color doesn't make the car. 

On the plus side, this is a pretty car to look at. It came with a whole host of standard features such as: keyless entry, AM/FM radio/casette stereo, power locks and windows, air conditioning and power steering. Along with these, the sales brochure said it included: 4-speed electronic OD automatic transmission with lock-up torque converter; 3.78 axle ratio; front disc/rear drum brakes with 4-wheel antilock brakes and cruise control. There maybe other things that I am missing. Driving the car, the steering is responsive, and it holds the road well on the highway and in city driving. 

There has been a problem with the turn signal lights coming on even through not blinking. Inbal has taken her car into the mechanic to have it checked. They said they can't get the car to duplicate it, so they can't fix it. 

The car accellerates pretty well, though I think it gets awfully noisy at high speeds. 

There really is no big down side to this car, except perhaps that it is dull. It is dull to drive. Whatever it does, it does quite adequately, but nothing more. This car lacks sparkle. It has no heart. I would never encourage anyone to buy this car, but I wouldn't discourage anyone either. As Inbal said, "It's okay, I guess."
