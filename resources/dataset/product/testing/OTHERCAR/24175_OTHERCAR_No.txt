             This is a sharp looking auto. ,handles well ,and comfortable .
Slow in the first 2 gears ,can not get maximum rpm ,because transmission has a governor on it .
 Be prepared to replace battery every two years ,computer system drains them .Also major problems with electrical system ,especially on interior of car ,lights and radio especially .
  Read owners manual ,timing belt has to be replaced every 80,000km ,no exception .Fuel injectors and fuel rail can leak ,spilling gas onto the engine ,and have to be replaced .
  The car jack and its handle are a joke ,it becomes a battle of wits to use it .
  The rear seat is useless to anybody over 4' ,no leg room .
  Be prepared to replace shocks for a better ride ,factory issue are cheap and make for a rough ride .Rear hatch lifters are not strong enough to hold up hatch ,has a habit of dropping on you ,especially in cold weather .
  Replacement parts are expensive ,even air filter $23.00 .<br><br>
