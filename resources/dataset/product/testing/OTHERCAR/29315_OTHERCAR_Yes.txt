            I bought my first Tracker back in 1990 when they were still Geo's.  I loved it, it was my first new car, and a convertible 4x4 to boot!  Not a season came that I wasn't prepared for, nor was I ever stuck in a snow storm!

When she finally was laid to rest in Summer of '99, I did not have to think twice about a new car.  So I bought the 1999 Chevrolet Tracker, same colors and same options as my '90.  If you're happy with something, why change?

I love about my Tracker: the larger passenger compartment than previous models; the LOCKING tailgate (didn't have that on the '90); the cargo area (allows me to keep stuff locked away while the top is off); the convertible roof with removable side windows; the bigger 2.0 liter engine;  the extra cigarette lighter adapter; the LOW STICKER PRICE (my second Tracker cost $2,000 more than the first one, how's that for inflation?!); the smooth ride (much smoother than the '90, they finally fixed that!).

I hate about my Tracker: the lights, oh the humanity, the lights are ALWAYS on - there is no reason to ever use the manual switch as the day-running lights are the exact same as if you use the switch; also no need to have parking lights, as there is no way to use them WITHOUT the headlights on!  

This is NOT a good car for those with children, as I don't feel it is a vehicle that provides a lot of passenger safety.  Yes, it has dual airbags, but a convertible has no overhead protection from crushing.  Also a pain if you have kids is getting in and out of the back seat.  Not a problem if you buy the non-convertible model.

But if you want fun, this car has fun written all over it.  Not a sunny day goes by that I don't get envious looks in traffic ;-)<br><br>
