            We purchased our 90 Volvo 740 Turbo Wagon in 1995 when it had 50 k miles. I loved the powerful engine and handling from the time I test drove it, and it has never let me down- it is great fun on the highways, handles great on curvy country roads. Our Volvo wagon has been loaded with kids and gear for its entire life, and still looks great and is going strong with 134 k miles. I have leather interior, power options, third seat ( capacity 7) and power moonroof. 
Maintenance is not cheap, but I see this as an investment to keep a great car going strong. We have had only one unexpected "situation" when an undocumented relay gave out. (it was not in the computer chip, or in Volvo's literature)It took awhile for my mechanic to figure out the problem, but it was a $5.00 part that installed in minutes. As far as heavy rain and snow handling: Yes, the car has lots of power in the rear wheels. It is a heavy car, so keep good tires on it, with lots of tread, and you should have no problem. To outfit my car for last winter's Vermont snowstorms, I decided to purchase 4- 15" rims and have Nokia Hakkapulita (Swedish) tires mounted. This had been suggested early on as a strategy for driving in heavy snows. I had no trouble getting through fresh pow as deep as 6". Stepping on the gas sends lots of rpms to those rear tires, hence the difficulty in deeper snow and on ice.
