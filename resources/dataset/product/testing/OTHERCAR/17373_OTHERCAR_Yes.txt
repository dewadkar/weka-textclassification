            I bought a 98 Eclipse convertible (Spyder GS) in 1999.   The looks of the car were appealing enough to convince my brother to buy a 1999 GS model.  This 99 model was the last year that Mitsubishi produced the greatest looking sports car.  As it was on their TV advertisement aired during the first quarter of 1999, their catch phrase was �Do you still have a youth left?�  I guess the marketing team was mainly targeting to appeal towards males between 25 and 35 years old.  As one of those males in the age category, it surely appealed to my brother and me.   

Pros

Beside its looks, there are a few things worth mentioning here.  Unlike my convertible, the hardtop GS has much fewer blind spots in the back.   The GS model comes with a 4-cylinder 2.0 Liter 140 horsepower engine.  This engine is a little smaller and less powerful than Spyder�s 4-cylinder 2.4-liter 145 horsepower engine, which is also a bit more fuel-efficient than the 2.4 liter engine.   The GS model supposedly runs between 23 and 33 miles (vs. 22/30 for the GS Spyder) per gallon.)  However, when I drove the GS model, I could not tell the difference in the power of engines.  In fact, the way both the 2.4 and 2.0 engines accelerates is very similar.    This is probably because the GS model weighs about 50 lbs. less than the Spyder.   Also, the cargo capacity of the GS is 16.6 cubic feet, which is almost three times larger than the Spyder�s capacity of 5.1.  How big is 16.6 cubic feet?  It is more than the capacity of a regular sedan like the Honda Accord, which has a cargo capacity of about 14 cubic feet.  

Cons

Like my convertible, the back seats cannot take more than two adults, and it is just not comfortable for two adults.  For those of you who want a similar car with more room, Chrysler Sebring can be your best bet.   Also, the cost of insurance for the Eclipse does not come cheap.   Finally, it may entirely depend on the way a person drives a car, but I had to replace the front rotors after the car reached around 20,000 miles.  (Of course, the traffic in downtown Chicago is not normal.)

I personally love the looks of the second generation Eclipse the best.  And Mitsubishi totally disappointed me with the third generation Eclipse.  I surely hope that the fourth generation Eclipse (in 2004) will be a breathtaker.
