            This is my third digital camera.  First was a Sony Mavica, which has done some very nice work, even at 1.3 megapixels.  Taken it to Europe three times.  The main reason for getting another digital camera is because it is very awkward to carry a Mavica, plus dozens of floppy disks, on a trip.  On my last trip, careful as I was, I overwrote a few disks and that made me very mad at myself.  In addition, no one wanted to carry the camera around.  My wife would say 'let's take the camera'.  Well, who will carry it-I would get a 'can you carry it honey?'.  Well, neither of us want to carry that bulk and weight around all day!  So, we would lose out on many pictures simply because of the size of the camera.  

The second camera I got-which I returned (at a loss)-was the Nikon Coolpix 885.  EVERYONE said how RED the background was in photos, people's faces often were red, the colors were very often not accurate, especially indoors.  Plus the flash was anemic.  

I looked around ALOT, read everything I could, and I decided that NO camera can do EVERYTHING right.  For me, the compromise was to have a camera that would be with me at all times (it is).  I even found the S300 too big, just a tad, but if I have to think twice about it, I won't carry it.  The S110 takes great pictures for it's size, accurate color, decent flash that can moderately light up a room.  I honestly can't think of anything bad to say about it.  

My compromise is that for serious work I plan on getting an Olympus 3040 at some point, because that camera has the best tones and color quality that I think I've seen.  It is too big to carry around all the time, but is a fine camera for planned events, portraits, places where perfection is what you want.  But that is a maybe-I am really perfectly happy with this camera, and have enlarged pictures up to 8 x 10 with my Epson stylus photo 820 and the results are as good as most of the work I've ever done in a darkroom.

Next trip to Europe I will have one, possibly two 256MB compact flash cards (under 100 dollars now at newegg.com), and a few batteries, which are small and very easy to carry. That will make me, and my luggage, very happy!

By the way, it has a black and white mode which is nice too-I've always loved that mode, I guess it goes back to my early days.  Black and white photography to me captures the 'soul' of things.

 Even the pics at lower resolution (about 110KB size) come out fine for most things.
