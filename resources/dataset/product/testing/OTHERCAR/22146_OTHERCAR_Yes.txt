            The DC 215 as an excellent choice for a family camera. It is easily used by adults and children. The optical zoom lens is far superior over the usual 2x digital zooms on most digital cameras. The camera seems to have an excellent battery life, allowing you to take up to 300 pictures without having to charge or change the batteries. 

The only drawback to taking pictures is the wait for the image to be written to the flash card. This takes longer for the Kodak than it did for the Olympus that I previously owned. But, the quality of the photos is worth the wait. Just don't plan on taking rapid shots at sporting events or other fast moving events. Using the quick view option allows you to view your picture as it is being written to the card and allows you to save battery life by not having the display on all the time. One drawback to the software is you can't download all the pictures at one time. You have to drag each photo's icon from the camera window to the window you have chosen to place the photos in. Other than that the software works much better than the software provided with the Olympus I had previously owned. 

It was recommended to me by a good friend who owns a Kodak DC 290 camera. I chose this one based on the price and the options of the optical zoom lens based on my experience of the digital zoom. This is a fine camera and I highly recommend it to anyone wanting a entry level digital camera.<br><br>
