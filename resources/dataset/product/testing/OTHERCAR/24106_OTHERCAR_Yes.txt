            After my wife's 2000 Toyota Corolla was involved in a very serious side collision, I wanted her to be in a strong, kind of muscled car.  Thanks to our diligence and efforts with the insurance company, I managed to get her and my kids into a <b>2001 Buick LeSabre</b>.  On many occasions, I ended up driving the vehicle because my wife was in pain.  And I had to run the errands.  I also had to drive my son to the orthopedic clinic for his appointments.  He had sustained a cracked femur and required surgery to put it in a hard cast going all the way up to his chest.  I never had any problems with the vehicle.  It was so smooth to drive.  Was this due to the leather seats?

<b>2001 Limited Sedan Buick LeSabre is just a few steps above 2000</b>

While my wife liked the car for its spacious and wide interior and interior mirror which she uses to check her make-up, I liked it for its leather seats and its automatic functions.  God knows how many times I fixed the driver's seat!  It was so comfortable to do so with just the push or adjustment of a handle.  
<i>Just be warned so you don't go through the same thing I went through</i>

The headlights are halogen and the ceiling light will remain open a few minutes after you get out of the vehicle.  Don't worry if you see them on.  I had to check the car many times.  They went off on their own.  Any way, I valued the car for all the space and the sense of security it offers.  The only thing I think it misses was side-airbags because they were the ones that saved my wife's and children's lives in the Corolla.  This is why I would encourage anybody to make sure your vehicle is equipped with airbags or side-airbags!

<b>Standard equipment:</b>

The two 2001 models (custom and limited) both have front dual stage deployment airbags and a 10,000 mile engine oil change interval.  The exterior colors are available in Dark Chestnut, Dark Polo Green and white.  My wife and I selected the Dark Chestnut one.  You will fall in love with the sound speakers!  Great stuff that even your teenagers will appreciate.  However, the limited model has a new seat fabric and the OnStar navigation system.  Protect your life and that of your loved by being in a heavy and strong vehicle!

This Buick is a nice and reliable vehicle.  If you are on the market for a new vehicle, you can check this one out.
