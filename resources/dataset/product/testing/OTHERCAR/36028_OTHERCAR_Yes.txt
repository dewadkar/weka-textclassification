            This is my very first Saab automobile, and I am very happy.  Mine had 113,000 miles on it when I bought it, and have put over 14,000 miles on it in the first year I have owned it.  The only problems I have had were a couple of light globes fail, and a pre-existing problem (when I bought the car) of the windshield washer pump not working.  If you are a relatively handy mechanic this is the car for you.  All the lubricants are very easy to change, spare parts are easy to fit.  It is best to source the spare parts from www.ebay.com and install yourself because you save around 80% of your money!  The engine is sweet, economical, powerful and quiet.  The transmission is smooth and tight, the build quality is superb, it is a very safe car, the doors close like a vault.  The ride is amazingly quiet, you can hardly hear the horn from the cockpit.  Everything works, electrical, mechanical, etc.  The digital message screen can get a few LEDs that don't work from time to time, but all messages are read very easily.  It is undoubtably the most comfortable car I have ever driven.  If you wish to install a 6 stacker CD player, go to www.etronics.com and buy a Clarion DG-625 for around $150 (cheap eh?), and install yourself in around 30 minutes.  The cable runs right to the back and simply plugs in.  Heated leather seats are plush!  Factory stereo system is great (6 speaker).  You can buy a lot of car for around $8,000.  Just one word of caution... only buy the 2.3 liter 4 cylinder, 5 speed transmission, all others are prone to reliability issues.  Moonroof is beautiful also.  Saab make beautiful cars!
