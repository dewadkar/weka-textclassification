            I'd long heard about how different Saturn cars and service were when I decided it was time to buy a new car last December.  I'd studied business management at college and the Saturn company was often held up as an example of what's right in customer service and products.  Therefore, I didn't shop around, just went straight to Saturn of Vancouver.  Sales people are friendly and hands off.  We were free to look with absolutely no harassment.  

   When it came time to actually purchase the car, the dealership didn't have exactly what I wanted (in fact, they spent the better part of an hour searching their computer for things that came close to having the options and colors I wanted).  When they couldn't, the only solution was to order directly from Spring Hill. The bad news:  it would take at least six weeks before my dream car was delivered.  A very long time to live in a state of anticipation.

Four weeks later:  My car is at the dealership, two weeks early and perfect!  It's been on the road for just over three months now and I have never had even the smallest problem or inconvenience.  Trunk size is ample, back seat a little small, but I hardly ever use it.  And cup holders?  There are six- go figure!  There's only seating for four!  Anyway, it's a cute, sporty car with just the right amount of power and an excellent sound system.  My husband (who is 6'5") wishes it was a little higher off the ground so he could get in and out a bit more easily, but that doesn't stop him from stealing it every chance he gets!  

Highly, highly recommended!
