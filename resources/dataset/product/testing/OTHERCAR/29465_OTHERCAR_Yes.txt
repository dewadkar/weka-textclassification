            First off, I have owned my Wrangler for about four years now and can tell you that this a solid vehicle.  

The best thing about Jeeps is that you can drive them ANYWHERE.  This is very useful when trying to find a parking spot at a busy event.  Not only can you park them, in, around, or on top of any parking obstacle, the superior turning radius make parallel parking a breeze.  Another good feature, overlooked by most, of the Wrangler is the bumpers, it's not going to cost you $500-$1000 in damage for a fender bender; most likely your big steel bumper will only be slightly scratched, if anything.  

Here's what you need to know about the Wrangler:

1. My four cylinder too weak, especially if you're planning on upgrading to any bigger than stock tires or using the A/C.

2. Winters are NOT cold.  The heater is excellent and the car heats up very quickly.

3. If you drive for more than 15-20 min in 90+ heat, regardless of your top being up or down, you will have back sweat.

4. The car is noisy.

That being said, the Jeep has been a good car for me.  I suggest the 6cyl, and for gods sake, get the manual.  Also, the hard top is a good feature, the interior can not be secured in any way without one.

As far as reliability goes, the car has been great so far. It costs little to maintain, and I've had no major problems with it so far, despite my utterly horrible experience with other Chryslers.

Overall, I would recommend this vehicle to students, as a second car, or to someone has just plain always wanted one.  I would not recommend it to someone who wants a comfortable ride or excessive storage space, or as a primary back and forth to work vehicle.
