            Owned this car since January 97 and haven't regretted it one bit! I presently have 128000 Kilometers on it.

Exterior parts/finish:

The paint of my 4dr RAV is sequoia green and has held up very well for 7 years of ownership. The odd nick or ding from parking lots hasnt caused any rusting (I am quick to use touch up paint). It shines up very nice if waxing and buffing but does show some circular hazing in areas - perhaps because of my washing technique. The plastic side body cladding has also held up very well considering it takes a lot of road abuse (I have been on many a gravel road). With the use of a black/grey plastic auto restorer it comes to life again very easily. Looks brand new. There is a lot of plastic on the exterior but it is of a high grade and does not show damage. I was orignally sceptical but am very pleased - I dont think it would look this good after 7 years if it was missing the plastic. 
My only real complaint is because of the angle and height of the windsheild I seem to pick up a lot more dings on the glass than in other vehicles. I never purchased a deflector but it may help.
I have the fenders and mud guards - an excellent idea for ruggedness and looks.
Complaint? While it really gives you extra clearance and extra storage room, the full size spare tire sitting on the back door is a hazard in any vehicle. One tap at low speeds and you can crush the door or shatter the glass. I do however like that it is slightly off centered allowing you to see much more out the rear window. Also, it works perfectly for bike carriers. 

Interior parts/finish:

The interior is good but not great. There is again, a lot of plastic - but it doesnt appear cheap. For the most part it seems like quality. It is ageless and with a quick wipe really does look brand new. It doesnt take much elbow grease to make the interior look show ready. 
The seat fabric, while of decent quality and seemingly rugged, does have a dated pattern on it. My seats are grey with blue/purple inlay. I wouldnt mind covering them up to be a simple solid grey or black. They are however quite comfortable with adequate lumbar support but definitely NOT plush. There are no arm rests, so on long relaxing journey's this can be somewhat tiring. 
The front seats can slide right up under the dash and then fully recline making what Toyota refers to as a "bed". Not very flat due to the seat design, but adequate for a rest.
The back seats also fully recline with a simple toggle and pull - or fold in half and down into the foot area for added cargo space. The headrests slide off easily and get stored on the back of the seat when not in use. There isn't very much foot room in back for adults but kids will do just fine. Headroom is plenty and 6' 5" people have been comfortable in the front seat.
In the back cargo area are two small storage compartments (one fits the on board tool kit for changing tires) the other is empty - I use for bungy chords and tie down straps). The jack is stored under the front passenger seat. 
The steering wheel is very nice, thick and not too large with a good grip. It almost feels like leather. 
I replaced the cassette stereo with an aftermarket CD player (A must) and need to replace the speakers. They lack dynamic range and power - especially at highway speeds when they compete with the road noise. 
Speaking of noise, the original lower profile tires that came with my RAV did not create much noticeable noise, however, I have added grittier tires and a roof rack that seem to soak up all available road noise with ease. For me it adds to the driving experience....but for others it can be annoying.
My biggest complaint besides the lack of rear leg room is the lack of cupholders. A common complaint. You can get the 98 cup holders and easily install them, but unless you do the entire vehicle will compete for ONE SINGLE centered cupholder?????? Sounds strange, but true. Not sure what Toyota was thinking on this one. RAV4 owners don't drink and drive I guess! :-)


Under the Hood:

Mine is a 2.0 litre 4 cyclinder manual shift (recommended)that ouputs 120 horsepower @ 5400 rpm with 125 FPT. Fuel economy is somewhere around 25/32 depending on the gas you use. Towing capacity is 1500 lbs - but dont plan any big hills with the full load. 
The performance is adequate and in the city or back roads feels quite punchy. Depending on how you drive I suppose. Just make sure you plan your passing on highways as it will occassionally give you a sweaty brow. 
Antilock brakes work very well - Disc in front/drum in back. It has always given solid braking performance even when you feel the antilock kick in. 
My RAV is the AWD version with Limited Slip Differential and a Center Lock Differential (Buton inside on dash for when you are stuck with at least one wheel off the ground or on a slippery surface. Otherwise, you don't need it). The LSD works wonderfully and it can actually be hard to "spin out" or do doughnuts (I was just testing ofcourse...).
The engine has been reliable if you treat it well and get the oil changed on time. Ive had no major breakdowns. The only "strange" thing is that on occassion (happened 3 times in 7 years) after moving my RAV to wash it in the driveway and then moving it back it would not start the next morning. Needed to warm up or dry off? I read somewhere that the computer resets itself after such short  trips (20 seconds on and off), but im thinking that maybe it was due to moisture buildup. Not sure because it rarely happens. I should note that I have driven through streams with no ill effects. 

Through the big back door:

I love the storage capacity of my 4dr RAV. 58 cubic feet with the back seats down. You can load a ton of stuff too because it is very square and easy to stack things to take advantage of all that space. If you have something long you can put the front passenger seat down (providing you are the only one travelling). Unfortunately the back window does NOT open and you cannot really have the back door ajar. The back door is big and when open makes loading very easy. You can set things down rather than have to lift things up. 
My only complaints is lack of tie downs, the window being stationary and the door opens on the driver side and swings to the passenger side. Perhaps in Japan this is fine, but when you drive and park on the right hand side this makes it awkward - you need to move around the big door to get things in and out. Could be dangerous if you are parked on a busy street. 

On the highway:

I think the RAV is fairly comfortable with decent power that only lets me down when I want to pass someone at higher speeds. For everything 55mph and under it is more than adequate. The noise is loud with a roof rack and larger tires, but for me isnt too obtrusive. It feels stable and safe and you have an excellent view of the road. 


On city streets:

In the city the RAV drives aggressively and feels punchy with a manual tranny. It feels like a sports car compared to other mini sport utes. The body roll is minimal and smooth. It is plain fun to drive, very easy to park and power is not an issue. I drive aggressively and do not red line the thing!

Off the beaten track:

Most people wont take it off road. Most people will also think it shouldnt go off road. However, I must state that I have driven it off road quite extensively. You cannot beat it up because of the exposure underneath but why would you want to? Thats not what this is for. However, if you need to travel back roads, gravel roads, mud, sandy beaches etc this will perform excellently. I have driven through 2 feet deep streams (dont take your foot off the gas), muddy bogs and hills, dry creek beds with big rocks, deep snow and beaches. I have not had a real problem yet. I do take care and caution and dont drive recklessly. While this is not a Tonka toy, it will get you where you need to go. The LSD works great, as does the Center Lock Differential if you are stuck. There is NO low range gearing, but with my manual tranny it is quite easy to overcome. (Im only just now replacing my clutch at 128K)

In the shop:

As I said, im just now replacing my clutch at 128K which sounds average. No major repairs or replacements. Oil. Tires. The usual. 
I did not like dealing with Toyota (canada) and am glad that I can go elsewhere now that the warranty is expired. While thier prices were good, I didnt have great experiences. The RAV4 is a modern vehicle with all the computer stuff inside - so it can be a pricier fix, but there is alot that you can do yourself. It is fairly straight forward for the home mechanic/tinkerer. I am neither of these but do minor things like replace bulbs, fuses etc. 
Parts are not necessarily cheap so shop around. There are however, enough of these around that wrecking yards have plenty of parts. 
I did have the back door replaced once because of being rear ended - the independant body shop I used was very impressed with the RAV's quality stating it was an easy fix because of the quality of parts.


Impressions of others:

A lot of women will like the looks, a lot of men will think its too cute. I personally like the looks but I perfer a simpler/bold look. I dont have fancy graphics or anything on mine. The fenders and mud guards give it a meatier look and the large tires have a "cool" factor. I have had people be fascinated when I first got it, and others who hated it. You either like the looks or you dont, no biggie. However, you cant argue with its features. Most people are impressed by those at the least.

Overall:

I like my RAV. Plain and simple. During the winter it is a saviour and during the summer months it is all fun. I use it as a family vehicle, a cargo vehicle, an off road vehicle and a regular commuter. Who can complain with that? It feels safe, offers excellent road vision, decent gas mileage and a comfortable ride. Keep the small kids and adults in back and everyone will be happy. With the add-on cage you can also easily have a large dog compartment in back. The RAV is sporty, no question. Just dont ask it to compete with the 4-Runner, Jeeps, Pathfinders etc and you will be very happy. It is NOT one of those vehicles.
