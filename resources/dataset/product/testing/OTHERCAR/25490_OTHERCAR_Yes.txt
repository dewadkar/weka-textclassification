            I have a 1998 Saturn SL2. We bought it in December 1997 after our first son was born. It has been a great car with no problems. We bought it because we needed a family car and it has done a great job. My husband at 6'3&quot; can sit comfortably, without hitting his head. Also, my brother-in-law was in an accident in his Saturn wagon. It nearly totaled the other car and left only a scratch on the Saturn. These are all well made cars. Now we have two children and it's starting to get crowded. We still can fit the family comfortably, but if we had another baby, we wouldn't fit. There is a good sized trunk. I can fit a stroller and a weeks worth of groceries in it. It's easy to work on, like changing oil, etc. It has daytime running lights, which I didn't like at first, but now I do. I know that people can see the car, even when my headlights are off. They come on automatically. It's an easy car to drive, also. And I feel safe in it.<br><br>
