            Based on Suzuki's reputation, I expected a nice, reliable economy car. What I got was a pocket rocket. I needed lots of room for camping gear and a couple of big dogs, and a roof rack that would hold two kayaks. I got all that, but I also got a case of the grins every time I turned the key. This car is fun to drive. The handling is good, the acceleration is impressive, but what I really like is the free-revving 1.8L motor. It feels almost friction-free when you drop the hammer, and it emits a lovely sports-car like snarl. Music to my ears. (As opposed to the anguished bellow of the Saturn or the constipated moan of the Focus). But so much for the fun factor. The wagon holds heaps of gear, is quiet and comfortable for all-day driving and actually achieves the gas mileage the government says it should. This is the least expensive car I've owned in years. I could afford to spend more, but what would be the point?
