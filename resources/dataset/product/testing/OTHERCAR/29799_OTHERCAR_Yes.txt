            I purchased the DC260 for several reasons:  the credibility &amp; reliability of the Kodak name, compatible with the iMac &amp; the PC, and the high resolution.

I've owned the camera for approximately 10 months and cannot count the number of photos I've taken.  It is extremely useful for quick family photos - no focus, easy zoom.  More importantly, I use the camera as a tool for my job.  As a marketing consultant there are numerous times when we develop a product and it's the ONLY one (prototype).  Before it's released, I take a digital photo of it and in minutes have a print out of the product and e-mailing it overseas for quotes.

I prefer to use only the high resolution settings which gives the best quality.  The mid to low quality settings are too grainy for my taste.  High Mb Compact Flashes are important when using the high-res settings - I find that two disks are sufficient to work with.

If you need to take very close-up shots this is not the model to buy - Kodak does offer other models for this purpose.  

I my only negative comment is when taking close shots you must learn how to position the object in the lens.  The camera's lens sits low in the body therefore, when shooting close the object tends to get cut off.  Not a major issue since after only a few shots you learn to adjust the position of the camera.

The price was on the high end when I bought this but I shopped around and found the best price ($775.).<br><br>
