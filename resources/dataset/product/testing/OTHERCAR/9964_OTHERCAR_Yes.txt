            The Chevrolet Corvette offers a great opportunity to buy a powerful, high status vehicle that will keep a stable value.  The best deals are those Corvettes that are a few years old.  I personally enjoy the styling of the 1993 - 1997 more than the new ones.  The Vette is half the price ranging around $20,000 to $25,000.  Now this may seem expensive, but you will recoup practically the same value if you sell it a few years later.  On the condition that the Vette has not been abused in miles or wear and tear.  If you do the math and the insurance is reasonable you could probably get a Vette for two years and still pay less if you bought a brand new, conservative car.  And this is taking into account oil changes, tires, and of course the wash and wax.  <br><br>
