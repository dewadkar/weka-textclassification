             My first experience of a Trans Sport was when working as a Field Engineer in Poland, when the customer was using one to transport us daily from hotel to factory. I was impressed, right up to the point where it burst into flames at 60mph on the way back one night, and we barely made our escape out of, what when on to be in a very short time, a burnt-out shell.

 So when I became involved with someone through the net, imagine my delight when I came over to meet her, and discovered she owned a Trans Sport. Well, we married, and I emigrated here, and now have come to live with one.

 Have my prejudices been overcome?..... Largely, yes. This is a very well equipped, comfortable, and spacious family vehicle. It is fast, reliable, and handles as well as one would expect for a Minivan. My wife has had this vehicle for almost two years, and I've co-owned for seven months. It has never let us down, always given plenty of warning of problems, allowing us to get it into the dealer to sort a small problem, before it becomes a big one!

We've had a few minor things fail, but nothing to stop the car, and repair costs haven't been crippling.

I rate reliability above all in a car. When I start a journey I want to feel confident of finishing it. I feel that in this car. It's not the best I've owned, but it's an excellent workhorse for a busy family.
