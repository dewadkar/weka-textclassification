            How well does an inexpensive car like a KIA hold up in an accident?  

Unfourtunately I recently had the misfortune of finding this out in great detail.  

I've owned my 1999 Kia Sephia for about 2 years, during that time it has served as a very stable and reliable vechicle.  It has a few noteable issues that I will explain shortly.  

My wife and I were on our way to dinner to celebrate our 3rd wedding anniversity.  A commotion on the side of the road drew my attention to the shoulder, and when I looked back to the road, traffic ahead of me had come to a complete stop.  

Slamming the brakes to the floor, I locked up the brakes in a desperate attempt to stop the car.  

Unfortunately, the car did not stop in time, and I struck a medium sized pickup truck in front of me.  At the time of impact, I estimate that the car was traveling between 15 - 25 MPH.  I watched bewildered as the hood folded like an accordian, and the car came to a jarring stop.  

Thankfully, no one in either vehicle was hurt at all, and we were able to move the cars to the side of the road and take care of all the necessary details.  

While the car was still able to run, it was definetly not in a safe condition to drive anywhere, and we quickly got it off the highway and parked at a relatives house less than a mile away.  

The front left corner of the car sustained considerable damage, the headlight was smashed in completely, and the quarter panel and hood were seriously impacted.  

The body shop picked up the vehicle and prepared a damage estimate.  The verdict came down, the car was a total loss.  

There are several key points that came out of this accident that I would like to share:

BRAKES:
The brakes on this car are horrible.  It's stopping distance is far too great. Although the main cause of this accident was inattentiveness on my part, a car this size should have stopped much sooner than this.  This accident would not have occured if the braking system in this car were not as bad as it was.  In addition during the 2 years I owned this car, I had to have the front brake rotors replace under warranty twice.  

AIRBAGS:
Niether driver or passenger side airbags went off during the crash.  Perhaps the impact was not enough to trigger them.

DAMAGE:
The car suffered serious damage from a relatively low speed impact.  To some extent this should be expected with the &quot;crumple zones&quot; designed into todays cars.

VALUE:
To my surprise the Kia held it's value surprisingly well.  For such an inexpensive car, the settlement from my insurance company (Allstate), covered the full value of my outstanding loan on the car, and I even ended up getting cash due back to me.  

I hope this information is useful to those of you who read this.
