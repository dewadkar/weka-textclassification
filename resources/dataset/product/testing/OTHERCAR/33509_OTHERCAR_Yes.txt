            I've owned a Kodak 200 Plus (1MP, fixed focus) for over three years.  It takes good pictures, as the reviews at the time claimed.

But inevitably, the upgrade bug bit, even though I don't take all that many pictures anymore.  Given that, I didn't want to spend too much for a new camera.  When I saw a 2MP unit on sale for $130  (I don't recall the brand) at Office Max, I just couldn't resist.  Fortunately, as it turns out, all the local Office Max stores were out of stock.

But now my juices were flowing. My need was for an easy to use point and shoot camera to take casual pictures of family, friends, trips, etc.   I settled on the Fuji A205 based on its price, and the high marks the Fuji 2650 got from its users. The specs for the two are very similar, so I assumed the performance would also be.  I liked the A205 because of its ability to show pictures on TV's, which the 2650 lacks.  I could almost hear the giggles of the grandkids as they saw themselves...

I've only had the camera for a couple of weeks and haven't taken that many pictures, but it's performed even better than I'd expected.  I took a couple of pictures of our house from across the street, one at 1MP, and the other at 2MP, and printed them on plain paper.  Whatever software I used pretty much filled the letter sized sheet, producing  8X10 like pictures.  Wow, not only did they come out sharp and on color, but there wasn't any difference in quality, at least to my untrained eye, between the two!  I could almost count the shingles on the roof, and felt like I could almost see the blades of grass on the lawn.  Other outdoor shots, which I did not print, also came out great.

In contrast, indoor flash shots in low light came out on the dark side when shot in automatic mode, but the images were sharp, so a bit of  brightness/contrast editing made them quite acceptable with only minor degradation .  I haven&#146t tried using the EV adjustments in manual mode yet.

The optical zoom and macro modes also gave sharp pictures with great color.

The pictures, when displayed on TV (the video out feature), are noticeably degraded.  This degradation is only in the TV image, and does not affect the image in the camera.

I did not bother loading the included software, instead used already installed programs, the images loaded quickly and without a hitch.

The Fuji website has sample pictures (which take a bit of navigating to find) from their lineup of new cameras.  As with all of the cameras, the A205 ones are simply stunning.  Had I seen these before taking any pictures, my reaction would have been&#133&#148yeah, sure&#148&#133but now, artistic content aside,.. &#147hey, maybe..&#148.

All in all, I&#146m very pleased with the camera.  It performs pretty much like the Fuji 2650, as described by its users.
