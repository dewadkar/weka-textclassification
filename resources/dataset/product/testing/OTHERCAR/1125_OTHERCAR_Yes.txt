            I purchased a Black 2000 Dodge Neon ES from Asheville Dodge in Asheville, NC. After a long thought process and a lot of turn downs from Chevrolet dealerships in the area about new Cavaliers (I'm a Chevy Woman), I decided to give a friend of my husband's a shot of getting me into a vehicle (John &quot;Pain&quot; Boyer: 6'8&quot; 400lbs, full-time Dodge salesman and part-time GAWF wrestler). This thought came after I read a lot of reviews on the new Neon and reviewed prices on the Neon, Escourt, Cavalier, and Eclipse. I really loved what I read about the Neon and the price was so much lower than the other vehicles I considered.

So, I purchased the 2000 Neon.

I absolutely love this car!!

Why? I traded in my 1986 Chevrolet Caprice Classic w/ 5.0 305 4 bbl 8 cylinder on this little car.
I love lots and lots of muscle power out of a car. I love &quot;8's&quot; more than I love &quot;4 bangers&quot;. This Caprice still had lots of &quot;boot scoot and boogey&quot; and less than 100,000 miles on the original engine. However, I needed to restore the &quot;beast&quot; somewhat and I couldn't afford to restore her. So, I decide on a new car. Why a small car? Simple I did not want to spend $30,000-$50,000 on a vehicle. That is way to crazy! It would have to be something really special (like a Jaguar, Corvette, Lotus, and etc.) and not a massed produced &quot;family&quot; car like what I needed. All I need is a good reliable vehicle for me to get to work with, do the shopping in, and get me and my husband back and forth on our yearly trips to Florida to visit his family. However, I must have some power not a sluggish &quot;lawn mower&quot; (like a Subaru or a Nissan).

This Neon of mine is just as fast, if not faster, than the Caprice I had.
It gets me around those tranfer trucks in a hurry (from 65-90 faster than the 305 engine I was used to)
It has 132 horsepower which make is a pretty good &quot;boot scoot and boogeyer&quot;. It defintely does 0-60 in 8.2 seconds, I did time it on the highway (I came to a complete stop before getting on I40 and punched the gas until I reached 60, while I timed this process and got onto I40).
Woohoo!!!!! The new Neon is not sluggish!!!!

The interior is great! It has more room than a 1988 1/2 Escourt that I owned and just as much room as my sister's 1994 Grand Am. We helped our best friends move using this car and you would not even believe what all we put inside the trunk and back seat of this Neon!. The back seats being able to be folded down to make more room is &quot;out-of-this-world&quot;!! It goes from small car to almost a small truck. Lovely, just lovely.

The Neon handles wonderfully. It turns corners as if it is on rails! It has impressed my husband who is a big time sports car &quot;nut&quot; (he likes MG, Porshe, Corvette, Triumph, and etc.) For those of you who don't like lots of road feel this is not the car for you. The Neon has plenty of road feel and lots of &quot;cool&quot; engine noise, which I love! 

As for reliabilty!, I trust this car. Yeah, people will tell you about there bad &quot;times&quot; with their Neons but I have personally never seen one broke down on the side of the road. And if they bought one used, chances are they may have bought someone else's problems. I have always had a soft spot in my heart for the Neons, they are nice cars. All cars have some problems and some more than others. Which, is why you will never see me buy another Ford again. Personally, my 2000 Neon ES came with free roadside assistance, free mantinance for up to 30,000 something miles, and other warranty plusses. Daimler Chrysler has kept constant contact with me to be sure I'm happy and so has Asheville Dodge, which Chevrolet and Ford has never done. Plus, I have the option of an extended service plan which will cover me for up to 7 years/100,000 miles. This extended service covers over 800 parts on my car and all I will have to pay for any repair is either $50 or $100 which ever deductible I choose. So that means if the transmission needs replaced down the road, at the most it will cost me is $100. This plan pays for itself. Why? Because I am one who does the required services on my car religiously. Oil changes and such add up to a lot of money of a long period of time.
So, my questions to those who complain about Neons.
How many times did you change the oil?
How many miles is on the car in question?
How hard have you driven it?
And truthfully, how much trouble have you had out of other cars? About the same or more right? 

My opinion is buy the 2000 Neon you'll be happy! You won't have much &quot;sticker shock&quot; either!
Better yet, contact: Jon &quot;Pain&quot; Boyer at Asheville Dodge 860 Tunnel Road Asheville, NC 28805 (828)298-4911. He'll treat you right!<br><br>
