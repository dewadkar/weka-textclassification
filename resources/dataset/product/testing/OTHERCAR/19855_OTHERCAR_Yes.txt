            The way I ended up with my black '99 S-10 is basically they treated me well at the dealership - that is rare, and I wanted to reward them, as well as show some faith in American craftsmanship. The guy that sold me the truck said he was an implant from a Saturn dealership - that was probably why he was so NOT like the typical salesman. 

My previous Vehicle was a '94 Nissan 2wd that I loved and had no problems with ever, when it was time to trade up, I went to the same Nissan dealer I bought my first one from (ABC Nissan in Phoenix). I was treated so poorly, I decided to look around and ended up going with Chevy. I got a base 2wd, 4cyl with auto and air. I now have about 25k miles on it, zero problems(I would hope so, right)?

Looks:

I'm very happy with looks of my S-10, it's very attractive. Curvy, but not ugly like the newer Toyotas and Fords. Black is the dumbest color for Arizona (it attracts dust and heat), but hey, I gotta maintain the rebel image here.

Performance:

With the air off and in the &quot;3&quot; gear (it goes D - 3 - 2 - 1) &quot;3&quot; is basically a &quot;Drive&quot; and &quot;D&quot; is like overdrive) acceleration is nothing to get excited about. With the Air on and in &quot;D&quot;, it's much worse. That I can get over, nobody buys a truck to drag race in anyway(but, my 4-speed Nissan was wayy quicker). The ride is smooth and solid, and that is where you know your in an American truck - you get the impression you're riding in something made out of metal, instead of an eggshell(imports). I guess what the power curve lacks in speed, it makes up for in torque - I hauled 4 adults(not that we acted like them), and a HEAVY motorcycle up the steep hills between Phoenix and Flagstaff (a 2 hour drive), the truck didn't break a sweat, not bad for a 4-banger.

Inside:

Nice cloth seats - readable dash, cold air. Comfy

Cool Stuff:

Full time daytime running lamps, also the headlights turn on automatically when it's dark and off again when it's light.

Conclusion:

Just what a truck should be - Reliable, sturdy, and just comfortable enough.
