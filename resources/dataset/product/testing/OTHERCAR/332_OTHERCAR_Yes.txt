            I bought an SUV because I needed the cargo space.  They're also very hip, you know.  Was I hypnotized by those slick Nissan ads using fairly-hip modern rock tunes?  It couldn't have hurt.  I choose the Nissan Xterra for it's sporty yet understated looks and decent price.  I went with the XE with the V6 engine, and it comes equipped with just about everything you'll need.  The SE doesn't offer much more.

This is a great-looking car, as far as SUV's go.  It's rakish and youthful, and this goes well with my lifestyle.  I live in Los Angeles, and I have no plans to go off-roading.  The aluminum roof rack is stylish, but I doubt that I (or most other Xterra drivers) will put this to use.  The gear basket is also useless for me.  Initially I found the asymmetry of the rear panel kind of weird, but now it's more like a stylistic quirk that's unique to this car.  The alloy wheels are chunky-looking, probably the ugliest bit on the car.  The grey plastic bumpers add to the utilitarian-look, and are actually a good idea, because they're meant to be bumped right?

The ride is a bit bumpy, it feels like driving a truck.  But it's solid, and the V6 provides a fair amount of push.  The power steering provides just the right amount of resistance.

The interior is pretty spartan, but it's clean and attractive.  The cloth seats are a little rough, but I think that's the idea.  There is plenty of space all around, and sitting in the back seats is definitely more thrilling than sitting shotgun.  &quot;Stadium-style seating&quot; means that the back seats are elevated slightly above the front (This explains the rise in the car's roof) ones.  This lets you almost see over the heads of the driver and front passenger.  The rear seats fold down completely flat.  So you could sleep back there, or just lay about with somebody you like.  There's also extra-special cup holders and plenty of cigarette lighter/AC outlets.

The CD player-equipped system sounds OK, it's even equipped with tweeters.  You won't be cranking out mean bass sounds while cruising down the street looking hard.

There are just a few things lacking here.  It would be nice if there was a gearshift indicator located on the instrument panel, so you don't have to look down at the thing to see which gear you're in.  Height-adjustable driver's seat would be nice too.  I find myself missing a cassette-deck too, but that's available with the SE.

So, if you're at all interested in this kind of vehicle, go for it.  It's easily the best in it's class.  Also, it's very new and fresh, and helps you to make friends.<br><br>
