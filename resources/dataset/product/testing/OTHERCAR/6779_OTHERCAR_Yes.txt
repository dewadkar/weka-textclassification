            I bought my '97 plymouth breeze in May of 2000. It had about 35,000 miles on it and it was only $11,000.  Not a bad deal considering my not so shiny credit history.  It was not too old, it was stylish, and it was a pretty smooth ride.  Although it was not the most powerful car I have ever owned, it performed much better than the average four-cylinder.
   
Anyway, It has been a pretty good car except for the fact that it started to leak oil at about 40,000 miles as many people in here have discovered with the 2.0 engine.  I was not the happiest person when I discovered this simply due to the fact that you should not have problems like this considering the low miles.  Oh well, other than that, I have been pretty pleased with it.  It rides very smoothly, even at high speeds(85+), and it gets descent gas mileage(23-27mpg).  I have since had no other problems with it nor has any of my other friends that own one except for the small leaking problem.  Another thing that I really do like about the car is the room.  It very comfortably fits five of my larger friends and has plenty of leg room to spare.  The trunk is quite massive as well.

Although the car has not been a 'nightmare' to own, I'm not sure if I would ever buy another nor would I ever recommend one to a friend.  If you are reading this because you are considering buying one of these, don't cross them off your list but try out a Honda or something first. Or if you can find one with a 2.4 engine, I have heard nothing but good about those.<br><br>
