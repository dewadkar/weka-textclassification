            I have been leasing a Honda Accord for over a year now, and thus far, there has been nothing I'm not happy about.  
First, this car has a very smooth ride. It rides fairly high off the ground (unlike the Camry), so you don't feel every bump in the road. Second, the interior of the car is sharp.  There's ample storage space, whether it be in the glove compartment, 2 conole containers, enormous trunk, or with the removable back seat.  On the outside, the Accord's sharp look is maintained. The car is sleek and smooth, with no jagged edges or outrageous decorations.  
Under the hood, even though I only have a V4 engine, the car still has pep.  I have no problem getting good speeds (over 100mph) on the highway. Economically speaking, the car has saved me a ton of money. While most of my friends are driving SUVs that guzzle gas (and their money), the Accord is capable of getting upwards to 400 miles to the tank (highway), and at least 275 miles in the city. Overall, this car should be a consideration for anyone who wants to ride in style without spending a fortune.  It is definately the most economical car I have encountered.      <br><br>
