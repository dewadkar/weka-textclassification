            I have had my Galant for 2 1/2 years now. I bought it new after looking at all the current reviews and not finding anything too controversial. The main thing that hooked me initially was the appearance, the fact that the rear windows go all the way down, and the financing. (0 down, etc for a year)

<b>Engine & Transmission</b>
The transmission and engine are very good for a 4 banger. The transmission is electronically controlled to match your driving style and environment. Some of the previous reviews commented on the lack of power especially uphill. This is very likely if the previous drivers had "light feet?" I have a very heavy foot and have no problems climbing consistent steep hills. (The AC can cause problems since it steals so much from the engines power.) This can be reset by disconnecting the battery but I wouldn't recommend it unless you have the CD player's security code. The tranny for the most part is bulletproof. It is stable with a 75 shot of NOS or 8-10 PSI from a supercharger. 

<b>Sound</b>
The stock sound system (not premium) is definitely lacking. The front 6 1/2" speakers and the rear 6X9s are only 15 watts each and the deck barely peaks that. Replacing these was one of my first projects. Having absolutely no experience working on cars, I was still able to replace the deck and all four speakers with relatively few problems.

<b>Support</b>
I was lucky to find the best online Galant website ( http://www.clubtgc.com ) This is a forum with 2800 members that either drive Galants, are mechanics or are Shops looking to help customize. Here you can find great information for your every desire from adding a supercharger or turbo to your engine to just getting new brakes at great prices.
They also have a great section for car problems or questions that are regularly watched by Mitsubishi mechanics. 

<b>Customization</b>
By purchasing a Galant you are already saying that you want to be different. (Otherwise you would get a Camry or Accord which thus far have better track records.)Add a spoiler, a drop, some altezza lights, new rims and this 4-door family sedan is now a sleek-looking ride. I have had many people complement me on how hot my car looks. How often does that happen with an Accord or Camry? 

<b>Reliability</b>
I am now at 46000 miles. The battery went dead last month. I replaced the brakes pads at 30k. I did get the 72000/7yr extended warranty but haven't used it yet. I have generally had good service from the Mitsu shops. (Both times were problems caused by my messing around with different things. One time I accidentally grounded a wire while installing the back speakers, the other was the back bumper paint was webbing from closing the trunk too hard.) Both times they took care of the problems and were very accommodating. (BTW the trunk is very light and takes almost no effort to close at all; this makes it really easy to slam especially if you are used to older cars where it takes a good yank to close.)
The glovebox is plastic and very poorly made. After about a year it began to rattle constantly. The lock comes out sometimes when you lock it and Mitsubishi hasn't come out with a solution for this problem. 

<b>Tires</b>
I didn't care much for the stock tires and rims and replaced them with 17s and good tires. The stock tires do not handle turns much over the speed limit and are become quite noisy after a few minutes over 85mph.

<b>Seating</b>
The front seats have plenty of head room and leg room. I am 6'3" and fit well. However I have the seat all the way back so the people in the back aren't as lucky. As others have mentioned, the back seat situation is horrid. Having grown up in a Camry family, I noticed that the Camry is no better. I am usually alone so this isn't much of a problem.
The seats themselves come with a nice stain-resistant fabric that looks and feels decent. However after 4-5 of driving, they become quite uncomfortable. I recently got leather installed for $600 and that solved this problem.
