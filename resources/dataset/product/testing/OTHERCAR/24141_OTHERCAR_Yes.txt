            About two years ago I became interested in purchasing a digital camera. I spent time researching and trying them out and decided that the technology was just not quite there yet. Recently the urge to find a digital camera reappeared. Both my partner and I do web design and were getting really frustrated with the amount of time that it was taking to scan in images. We knew what our requirements were. We needed a camera that would take images that were good enough to use on the web but also could be printed for flyers and business cards. Unfortunately, we did not have a whole heck of a lot of money to spend. I spent hours researching what camera to get and had decided on a 2.1 mega pixel Olympus. Last weekend we ventured over to our local electronics retailer armed with specs and reviewsï¿½our decision made when we over heard the salesman talking about the Ricoh RDC-5300. It had everything that we wanted in the Olympus and MORE for the same price!

This is a great camera for the price. It took me a bit to get the hang of it but once I did WOW! The images are fantastic! The colors are true. The images are detailed and clear. None of the images that I took needed any adjustment. I was amazed when I printed one with my older Epson printer. I could barely tell that it was a digital print. The camera itself is easy to use. When you turn the camera on everything but the flash goes back to the setting that it was on when the camera was last used. I really wish that it were the same with the flash! I love that I can go back and look at the images that I have taken and erase that ones that are not good. This helps me to know that I got the shot that I was looking for. I had a bit of trouble getting the PC interface to work but it was purely a case of user error. The camera does take AA batteries and yes, the battery life is pretty pathetic with alkaline batteries so we are planning to buy some rechargeable ones. I really like that the camera has 8mb of internal memory AND takes smart media cards. The one that we purchased actually came with a 32mb smart media card!

I am so incredibly pleased with this camera! I really feel like we got the best camera for the best price. I initially thought that we would have to spend far more to get the quality that we have gotten from this Ricoh. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in getting his or her feet wet in the latest digital technology!<br><br>
