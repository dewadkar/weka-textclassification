            If all you care about is low purchase cost and high gas mileage, welcome home!  

I had this car a week as a rental car.  My first impression was &quot;I hope I don't hit something as I might not survive&quot;.  This car is small!.  And the hood length is even shorter.  It seems like almost every inch of this car is devoted to the small passenger compartment.

The ride and handling were sub-par.  Driving 55-65 on a smooth interstate, the car seemed to wander back and forth.  My wrists were white after the short interstate run.  Around town this car would lean in every turn.  The skinny tires would slide to some degree on most turns I made.  The acceleration was in-family too.  I found myself routinely putting the pedal to the floor just keeping up with stoplight traffic.

On the plus side, I found the car just sipped gasoline, only using about three gallons after a week's driving.

Mechanically this car looks like a short-life vehicle.  The engine compartment is crammed and everything looks sort of like it came from a motorcycle.  It is made by a motorcycle company after all!<br><br>
