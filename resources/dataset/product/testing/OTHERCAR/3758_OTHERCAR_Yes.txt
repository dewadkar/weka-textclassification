            After test driving various full size pickups and dealing with numerous high pressure-hungry salesmen,Chevy somewhat sold itself.
The Pewter colored,handsome body-style caught my eye.Not really paying to close attention to the salesman,I asked for the key.
It's handling was great.The cornering felt good.Opting for the Vortec V-6 with 5 speed transmission,it's was smooth and power was there.The hydraulic clutch is easy to push but slower to return than a cable clutch.
Interior wise, it's very roomy.Full gauge dash is another strong highlight compared to others with the idiot lights.I like to know what that engine's doing.Cruise and tilt steering was just $400.00 more than the basic model.
Chevy could have done a little better though by adding a fold down arm rest between the seats.It's split bench seat design is comfortable for driver and passenger.They partially made up for the armrest goof by installing a digital message center in the dash.According to the owners manual it will even remind you when your oil change is do.I haven't put enough miles on yet it to find out.
The Vortec V-6 with 5 speed is getting good fuel mileage.Around 18 to 19 mpg in the city. For the price,fuel mileage,performance and looks this truck was made for middle income people.<br><br>
