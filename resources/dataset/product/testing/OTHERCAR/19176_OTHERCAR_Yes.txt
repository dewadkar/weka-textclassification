            I've owned a Passat GLX wagon for 8 months.  I have a love/hate relationship with it.  I bought the car because I wanted a sport utility vehicle but couldn't afford a well-equipped one.  Knowing that I would rarely (if ever) take the vehicle off-road, I decided to look into the new breed of wagons.  There is no question that the Passat wagon is the best value on the market.  Its only real competitor is the Subaru Outback, which quickly loses when you compare the sticker prices.

So, let's start with what I love about my Passat.  I love the luxury.  I have the leather interior with all of the bells and whistles.  Both of the front seats have a wide range of adjustability - including lumbar support and height.  The interior features are ergonomically sound and very easy to use.  There is so much space in this car.  It's deceiving from the outside.  The back seat also folds flat to provide more cargo room than any Explorer I've seen.  Let's not forget the exterior looks.  The design of this car is beautiful.  I get compliments all the time.  In essence, this car is every bit as luxurious and well-equipped as a BMW or Audi.  It is certainly nicer than its Japanese competitors.  I also love the way this car handles.  You'd never know you were driving a wagon.  It hugs the corners and stops on a dime.  It also cruises nicely on the highway.  Blah, blah, blah, it's great, I can't live without it.

Now for what I hate about this car.  I must qualify these statements.  I only hate these things because the car is so great otherwise.  If I found these problems on any other car, I wouldn't have been as let down.  But the Passat wagon is so well-designed in every other way that it kills me that they screwed up on these things.  So, here goes.

1.  The remote alarm control.  It is shaped like a bulky plastic key.  It has a &quot;panic&quot; button right in the middle of it.  When pressed, it sets off the car alarm.  Unfortunately, when you put the keys in your pocket, the other keys on your key ring press up against the button and guess what...the alarm goes off!  It's the most irritating thing.  I took it off of my key ring and I use the key to lock and unlock the doors.  The design is so bad that I won't even use it.  Neither will my wife.
2.  Acceleration.  To say this car is sluggish is a compliment.  Mine is an automatic and there is a significant lag from the time you press the accelerator to when something happens.  It has the Porsche Tiptronic transmission, which is a far cry from being able to pop a clutch.  I actually took mine to the dealer and had them check the transmission to make sure it wasn't defective.  While the dealer had my car, they gave me a new Jetta to drive around.  The Jetta was much peppier and it had a 4-cylinder! I felt like a sucker. 
3.  Sun-roof noise.  You'll love this.  When you have all of the windows in the car closed and you open the sunroof, you'll hear a constant thumping noise that is caused by the wind.  The only way to get rid of it is to roll down the windows a bit.  I had to call the dealer to ask why my  car makes this terrible sound when the sunroof is open.  They are familiar with the problem.  VW even put it in the video they gave me.  Why not just fix it?
4.  The stereo.  It sounds great!  But...you have only one option if you want to listen to CDs.  The 6-disk changer.  Well, I don't know about you but I hate having to stop the car and change CDs when I've heard enough of the six.  I wanted a single CD player.  No dice.  They don't offer it.
5.  The cup holders.  I realize that this is a German car and they don't drink the 20oz. drinks over there but come on.  How much harder is it to design a cup holder that ships with the cars with MPH on the speedometer?  This thing holds a 12oz. can.  That's all!  And it blocks the ashtray when its in use.  So much for having a charging cell phone and a drink at the same time (as if anyone drinks from cans anymore).  

Like I said, these are nitpicks but they annoy the hell out of me.  So, I gave the car to my wife.  She loves it.  Would I buy it again?  Not without a turbo.
