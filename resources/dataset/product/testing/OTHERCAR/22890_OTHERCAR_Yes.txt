            On a recent business trip, I was compelled to upgrade to a larger car because I would be taking 3 colleagues and possibly a client in a car.  So the rental agency got me a Concorde LXi. Which turned out to be a good thing, because some of the folks turned out to be physically big. 

In a rental car, one does not have a lot of time to familiarize one's self with the instrumentation and controls.  Fortunately, the Concorde's dashboard controls and displays are easy to find and logically laid out.  The instruments are in three dials that are easy to read as well as attractive.  The 50/50 split bench leather front seat had power controls and were easy to adjust to the proper driving position.  The central console has a bit of simulated wood veneer that adds a bit of warmth that its cousin, the Dodge Intrepid, lacks.  The trim on the doors are also attractively done.  My only gripe is that the fastback design of the car makes the view out the rear window a bit difficult to judge when reversing or backing out the car.     

The Chrysler Concorde, thanks to its cab forward design, boasts a very roomy interior.  I was able to carry three big guys in the back without problem.  The trunk is one of the largest I've seen in any car; there is also a hatch behind the rear seat center armrest that allows unusually long cargo to be carried (e.g., skis). 

The 3.5L V6 engine, while not a barn-burner, is more than adequate in terms of acceleration--though this may be because I drove mostly with a full load of people and cargo.  The ride is stable, controlled and balanced, which is appropriate for a full-sized, near-luxury car of its class.  I did notice, however, that the Goodyear Eagle G/A tires, seemed a bit noisy on pavement, which would not be in character for this class of car; otherwise, interior noise while driving is quite acceptable. Fuel economy observed is quite good for this car's size, about 21 mpg in city/suburban driving around Portland, OR, with a lot of stop and go traffic on US26 and I-84. 

I wish I had more time to drive it in more varied conditions but I had to return home.  All in all, I would recommend the Chrysler Concorde as a good choice if you have to carry passengers on a regular basis, such as if you work in sales, or make regular long trips. While I do not have definitive information on pricing, I believe that it does offer very good value for the money in its class.
