            I own a 1999 Honda Prelude, 5 speed milano red, with a cold air intake and Tanabe racing medallion exhaust. I run a 14.75sec 1/4 mile time. Not to bad for a 2.2 liter four banger! My grandma bought this car for me 8 months ago brand new for 21,000 dollars in Wisconsin. I like..no LOVE this car with all my heart. Here's why!

Engine
The engine in this car is amazing for a 2.2 4 cylinder. I have beaten old z28's 5.0 Mustangs and plenty of other v8 cars. I call my car a v8KILLA, or 2fast4u. Its a little bit tough to race, if you are a racer, because of the vtec powerband. I bring the engine up to redline every time before shifting to stay in the vtec portion of the engine. It has 200hp with 156ft/lbs torque, but that doesn't say much since the power to weight ratio is so good. Its really easy and fun to mod these cars too. i put a cold air intake on my car and its really cool sounding, not to mention the nice deep growl of my Tanabe exhaust. The mods i made shifted the power band a little from low end power to upper mid power, but its definitely worth the money and i even get 30 miles per gallon on the highway.
Looks
I get looks from old people to young girls..I am a 19 year old guy. The exterior looks are clean and the lines really are brought out with the milano red color. The front end looks pretty cool with the license plate off and looks great from the rear. The tail lights of this car are really cool on my red Honda since they are clear and red. Its definitely a head turner but doesn't draw to much attention like a Dodge viper.(stealing/theft) But i love the way my car looks.
Interior
Perfect date car! Its definitely made for 2 people. There isn't much room in the back but its easy to fit one sideways back there. remember i am 6'3&quot; 200lbs with big friends. I have the all black interior and that always looks nice kind of luxurious. It forms around my body like a glove fits a hand. Everything is in a nice location and the position of the moon roof button is on the left so people don't play with it. Great idea! The best thing about the interior are the factory speakers. yes factory speakers! they hit pretty damn good but what can i say they are from alpine!
Community
I started driving this car and I noticed a community of the people who drive Honda Preludes. They seem more friendly and approach you saying &quot;nice car&quot; or they give you a wave here and there as you pass them on the highway or a side road. There is even chat rooms where you can talk performance parts or street race talk. If interested go to www.superhonda.com. The people who drive Honda's even want to join up and go for a joy ride together. Just like a club that meets every weekend.

Overall
I highly recommend buying this car. It's a joy to drive and see on the road. I am a proud owner of one. Buy the most reliable car...Honda.
