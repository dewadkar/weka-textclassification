            Honda has hit a home run with its Odyssey van. I owned two Toyota Previas and two Toyota Camrys before buying an Odyssey ten weeks ago. We test drove most of the vans on the market and were impressed only by the Honda. While the ordering process was an ordeal and took two months, we love our new van. 

As our children grew, they no longer fit into the rear seat of a Camry. They tried riding in the rear seat of a Toyota Sienna, and that was too small, too. We ended up with the Odyssey LX because the middle seats are large, and the third seat folds flat in the floor. 

We waited for a 2001 to arrive because the dealer was charging the list price for 2000's and 2001's, and the price increase was only about $400. I had been told to avoid the automatic sliding doors which are standard on the fancier EX, so it was an easy decision to buy the LX at about $25,000. The only option we added was the mudflaps.

The Odyssey rides very smoothly and has sufficient power unlike the older Toyota Previas. The finish is first class both outside and inside, and we like the gold color. The seats are quite comfortable, and the center captain's chairs pop out very easily. As with previous vans, we cut a carpet remnant to fit the floor so that we can keep the carpet clean. Lowes and Home Depot have decent quality indoor outdoor carpet, which will cost about $50.

We are very picky about a car being able to meet our needs, and the Odyssey does that quite well. There is still a shortage of Odysseys because many of its parts (including the chassis, transmission, and computer) are rumored to be in the new Acura SUV, which is made on the same line. We do feel that the wait was worthwhile, and that the price for the Odyssey is very competitive with the smaller Toyota Sienna and other vans.<br><br>
