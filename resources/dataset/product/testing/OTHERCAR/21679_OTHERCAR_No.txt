            its not the same little car any more. as chevy has changed the Geo. over from mostly Toyota parts to mostly chevy parts .the car has suffered.the seats are no longer as comfortable as they once were.my father drives a 1993 Geo. prism it has 126k miles and it is still running like new.the only thing beside the timing belt which get replaced after 100k miles although it was still in good condition.the only other repairs do to ware and tare was to have the front end realigned several times but this is very common in new England with the bad pot holes in the winter.the newer prism i supposed to have a larger engine has significantly less pick up than the older model.the handling in the newer prism is very stiff. the seats in the newer model are very uncomfortable and are not good for trips for more than an hour or so.the newer prism has been in for repairs more times in the past two year than the 7 year old prism we have. to any prism owner thinking of buying a newer model i strongly urge you to not buy a chevy prism it no longer had the quality that the Geo. prism had.and to anyone else who is thinking of buying a prism i i suggest that you take a look at the Toyota camry which is more like the Geo. prism than chevies new version.its not the same little car any more .as chevy has changed the Geo. over from mostly Toyota parts to mostly chevy parts .the car has suffered.the seats are no longer as comfortable as they once were.my father drives a 1993 Geo. prism it has 126k miles and it is still running like new.the only thing beside the timing belt which get replaced after 100k miles although it was still in good condition.the only other repairs do to ware and tare was to have the front end realigned several times but this is very common in new England with the bad pot holes in the winter.the newer prism i supposed to have a larger engine has significantly less pick up than the older model.the handling in the newer prism is very stiff. the seats in the newer model are very uncomfortable and are not good for trips for more than an hour or so.the newer prism has been in for repairs more times in the past two year than the 7 year old prism we have. to any prism owner thinking of buying a newer model i strongly urge you to not buy a chevy prism it no longer had the quality that the Geo. prism had.and to anyone else who is thinking of buying a prism i i suggest that you take a look at the Toyota camry which is more like the older Geo prism than chevies new version.<br><br>
