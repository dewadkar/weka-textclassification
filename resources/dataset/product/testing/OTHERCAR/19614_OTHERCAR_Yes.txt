            I love my saturn sc1 3 door coupe. It is great looking and is very well built. The polymer panels offer outstanding protection to the body. It has been hit by several shopping carts and doesn't show any dents. It is built solid. The saturn is very spacious and comfortable inside. The third door is the greatest thing that ever happened to a 2 door car. It is easy to get a small child in and out and saves your back from overextending to get in. Also it is handy when adults are getting in. The only fault I have found with my vehicle is that the brake system is too small. We have had to have new rotors put on.  I would still recommend this car to anyone. It is a superb vehicle.<br><br>
