            the only truck i'm going to ever buy is chevrolet.  the S-10 is cheap compared to other light trucks, and is the most reliable of them all.  i've only taken my S-10 in for routine maintenance in the past year i've owned it (it is a used '96 model).  even for 4 years of driving it around, it is in extremely excellent condition.  if you like driving in style, the S-10 sports a well designed exterior and interior compared to the other trucks in its class. 

i have an extended cab, and usually trucks have cramped room in the back.  the S-10 can comfortably fit an extra passenger in the extended cab, and you may be pushing it if you want to fit two (two children can fit comfortably in the fold-down seats).  

the interior is very easy to navigate, and the seats are very comfortable for being stock.  i have driven from los angeles, CA to denver, CO many times in my S-10 and i haven't had a single problem with my truck.  the seats were comfortable enough -- i emerged from my truck without any back problems or pains in my legs.  

the hauling capability of the S-10 is limited.  if you are a mover, i suggest the silverado or any of the C/K trucks.  i would also suggest that you purchase a 4WD or 6cyl truck -- the 2WD slips in snowy weather on icy/snowy roads, and is not road-worthy for off-road trips.  the 4cyl engine is horrible in high altitudes (as i have experienced in colorado), and it crawls up hills and mountains.  

the all american light truck for those who like the sporty look, the S-10 should be everyone's choice when purchasing a small truck.  <br><br>
