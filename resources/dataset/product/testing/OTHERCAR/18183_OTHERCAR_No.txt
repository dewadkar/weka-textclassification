            Purchasing the 1996 Nissan Pathfinder NEW was one of the worst decisions we had made.  Unfortunately, as with any new re-designing, there are quirks and bugs.  Well, this SE needed some serious exterminating.  We picked it up in March of 1996 and by May of the same year it was already in the shop for wheel bearing problems.  The noise was so great, you couldn't hold a conversation inside the cab going over 45 miles per hour.  After a very long run-around from the dealership and 5 visits in one month, they finally replaced the inner sealed wheel bearing in the front left tire.  Sure enough, in July of the same year, the right wheel went bad also.  Since the dealership new the history of our vehicle, they replaced it right away instead of guessing.  
Vehicle was fine for one year, then left wheel bearing went again and was replaced.  Dealership had to even contact engineering and what it came down to was a problem in the wheel base.  
Though the dealership and the company itself called this an unusual case, we saw a gentleman and his family pull into a local pharmacy with the same year Pathfinder, screeching the whole way.  When he got out, we asked about his vehicle and he was having the same exact problems.
So, hopefully the following model years were not as bad as the 1996 SE.

Finally, and worst of all, a few months before getting a new car, I had a tremendous scare with this SUV.  While in transport, another driver pulled out from a side street and cut me off.  Upon hitting the brakes, the vehicle's rear end lifted up and went to the side.  No skid marks, no noise, just me, sitting there in a 90 degree angle from where I was before.  A pedestrian said it looked like I was flying.  Shortly after, a report came out about SUV's too light in the rear having the same problem.  For the price we paid, the vehicle was not worth it.<br><br>
