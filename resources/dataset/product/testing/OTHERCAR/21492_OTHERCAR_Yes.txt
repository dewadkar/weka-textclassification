            This was a partial warning from my mother who said, as soon as you buy this car you will get married and have to sell it.  Here is the news, I just got married and there is no way I will sell this car.

I love it.  Maybe not as much as my new wife, but I do love it.  I had searched for the right car for many years to replace my aging vehicle.  When I saw the specs and reviews in several of the driving magazines, I was intrigued.  When I sat behind the wheel of my GTP and took it for a test drive, I had to have it.  

I was pleased with the smooth ride.  It was like gliding down the road.  I hit the gas and before I knew it I was over 100 MPH.  I am used to it now and I don't do that anymore.  But I will say, I have fun at the lights.

I bought the car for road trips that I make and with the heads up display, an option I would highly recommend, leather seats and 12 CD disc changer in the trunk, this is a sweet traveling car.  My wife and I took a one day trip to Albuquerque from Salt Lake City and back.  I love the smooth ride and the sheer power in the engine.  Setting the cruise at 75 MPH the car just glides.

Also I have to note that I have been hit twice, through no fault of my own and I am pleased to say that the car can take a hit and leave you still walking.  The anti-lock system is the best I have used, allowing me to steer when in full lock down on the brakes, keeping me from a head on.  

This is the first car that has inspired me to actually write to the manufacturer and praise them.  In short I love my Grand Prix GTP.  I love the power, the speed, the quickness and I love the way I feel when I drive it.  It is a great ride.  But don't ask me ask my dad who bought one just a couple months after I did.  And he is thinking of buying another here soon. <br><br>
