            I just turned 18. My dad let me have the C-Class. I thought it was not going to be good enough( driving to school, having enough power) I love it. It does not take up a whole lot of gas. I can fit 5 people total in the car. It is luxury and style. I have styled it up a bit and still, it looks great. I think this car is going to last me a life-time. Especially that the first tune-up is not until 100,000 miles and the computer tells you when it will need an oil change and in how many miles it will need it in. It is great. I do not have to do anything to the car. It tells me what it needs. The only thing is you have to take it to the shop to get the oil change so they can reset the computer on the car back to 10,000 miles until next oil change, but that is about it. My dad has his 500SL-Class, but that car is so heavy to drive, this one is more relaxed for when you want to go somewhere far. The lights in the car adjust to your comfort so they will not hurt you. I would recommend it to everyone I know. I love the air-conditioning computer that is has. It works so easy, just put in the temp that you want it and it will go up or down. ( say I want it to be 65 degrees, I just push the button until it hits 65 and it will do it automatically.<br><br>
