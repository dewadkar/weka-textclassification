            The Olympus D340-R digital camera is in my opinion one of the best mega-pixel cameras on the market. Of course there are better cameras with more options and pixels, but most of them if not all are at least twice as much. The pictures are sharp and clear and are of printable quality at smaller sizes such as 3X5 or 4X6. If you get much larger the quality diminishes somewhat. If you buy one be sure to invest in the &quot;Flash Path&quot; 3.5 floppy adapter, then you can download your pictures as if they were on an actual 3.5 floppy, if you use the normal serial download software be prepared to wait a bit for downloading into your computer. The LCD screen on the rear of the camera is very crisp and clear, my only wish is that it would have been a little bigger. In summing this camera up I would say that it is the best bang for the buck.<br><br>
