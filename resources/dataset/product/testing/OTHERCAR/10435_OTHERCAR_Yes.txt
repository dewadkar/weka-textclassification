            My 1991 Acura Integra has been a wonderful car to own up to this point. When I bought this car two years ago I had little automotive knowledge. All I knew was that this car looked and drove good. My previous cars were a '90 Ford Tempo and a '79 Datsun 810. The Datsun was faster, but the Acura is more refined. 

Now I consider myself a lot more knowledgeable about cars, and still I consider the Integra a good value. In the two years I have driven this car the only real problems I have had are the front axles (notorious on fwd cars). When I bought it from Norm Reeves Outlet there were already a few problems that they would not fix. Those are as follows:
-Power windows creaked going up or down
-3rd gear synchro ring grinded when I would shift
-Front speakers would not work

These problems still exist, but they don't really bother me. The 4 cylinder 1.8 Liter engine of the integra puts out 140 horsepower, which is pretty good compared to a civic, or any other car in its class. There is some torque steer if you take off hard, but that is easy to control. Handling is satisfactory for daily driving, but not meant for any track racing. The engine itself is quite tough, you can put it in the high rpm range quite frequently and never notice any abnormal behavior. The body style is still pretty up to date considering it is three generations old. And there are numerous amounts of aftermarket parts if you decide to fix it up. 

Complaints I have with the car.
The interior is a little bland. Maybe this is normal to think of for an 11 year old car, but it would be nice to have a little cleaner, smoother look. The stock four speaker sound system is kind of anemic. It works for me because I don't listen to my music in the car that much, but when I do it just doesn't cut it. Another thing is that the ride is pretty bouncy. My dad hates driving in my car, it is just too low and uncomfortable for him. But if your young and need a good car for a low price, then this is the car for you. If you want to get adventurous and fix your car up, then this is the car for you. If you just want something nice with Honda reliability, then this is the car for you.
