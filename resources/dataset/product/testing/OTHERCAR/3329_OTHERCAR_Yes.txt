            First Impression/Preface:
My Wife wanted another car in Mid-April of 2000. She had a 1995 Caviler, which we both loved. It had almost 120K, we sold it to our friends. But it was new car time. She wanted another GM and fell in love with the Blazer. I liked them well enough. Plus I liked the shifter on the floor. We went to my parents and the ford/chevy outfit (we've bought many vehicles from them) to pick my parents up for a family outing to the beach (there Grand Marquis was dead again),  While there, we found a 97 Blazer with low miles and a 97 Bravada, similar in price and miles. We liked the Bravada better, esp. Since it was white and beige leather (Illinois summers are hot). I like the leather much better because it was more comfortable than the cloth. So we bought it. The Ford dealer knew the prior owners, but they had since moved back to Florida. We did not even get a second opinion. 
Drive train:
The 4.3 V-6 has a very gruff sound to it. It sounds rather sporty. It has more zoom than a base explorer, but not quite as much as a V-8 Grand Cherokee. The 4-speed automatic shifts well and never slips. The smart track system is a permanently engaged AWD system that keeps an eye out for a slipping wheel. It works well in the snow. It handles ok. Something similar to a Jeep Cherokee, but not as truck like. The brakes felt rather mushy, something I hadn't seen in a car since our 1977 Buick Estate Wagon. I hardly drove it, but I liked it on trips. It rode better than my explorer did and I was pleased with highway gas mileage, @ 21 mpg. 
Interior:
My complaint was the darn hump in the passengers side floor. It was there for structural rigidity. I liked the shifter on the floor. Added a very sporty touch. Your body could just melt into the soft leather. Heaven on long trips. The A/C did very well, but wasn't as cold as comparable Ford, Chrysler or Toyota systems. I liked all the gizmos too. The drivers air bag had the horn built in with it which was nice, because some cars had horn buttons in bad places. The CD Player sounded great and so did the radio. The cargo area was smaller than explorers, but better than a Grand Cherokees. 
Durability
Here was our main complaint. This thing must have been a piece of junk to start off with. It had 43K when we bought it and it had 61K when we traded it in, on September 9 2001. Thankfully we had an extended warranty. The water pump broke twice, there was always something wrong electricaly and the brakes where always in need of repair. Plus, it ate front tires, like they where yesterdays donughts. It needed a front axle part when we traded it and was in need of an alternator too,
