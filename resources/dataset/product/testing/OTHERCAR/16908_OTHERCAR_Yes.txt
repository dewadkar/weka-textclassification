            We have some history with Subaru, my wife and I do.  Her college car was a 1988 Subaru GL 3-door that her dad helped her buy new.  She owned it, and then I came along and we owned it, until Spring of 1999.  When we sold it to (appropriately, it seems) a married couple in grad school, it had racked up more than 225,000 miles. In that time, we had one problem that I'd call a major repair, and that was the distributor exploded at about 170,000 miles.  Apart from that, it was little things like keeping an eye on the CV boots and chasing down the occasional oil leak.  We drove it to Oregon from San Jose in February of 1999 with better than 210,000 miles on the clock, and it ran flawlessly.  

So when the time came to retire it, there was really only one car we looked at seriously as a replacement.  The Subaru Outback, which we purchased in April of 1999.    

Apart from the great experience we had with the old GL, we did do some homework before we bought it.  We took a couple of test drives of midsize SUV's, and without exception disliked the back seats.  Most of them were too cramped for largish adults, whereas the Subaru feels roomier in back.  Even my dad, who owns an Explorer, admitted that the back seat in our car is more comfy than his.  Also, gas mileage was a consideration for us, and the Subaru is without question the mileage leader among SUV's of comparable interior room, RAV-4's and Sidekicks notwithstanding.

The motor is more advanced, but very similar to the one in our old GL.  A similar, albeit bigger, more sophisticated, and stronger horizontally opposed four cylinder engine (a water-cooled version of the immortally reliable VW Beetle motor, of which we also own one, by the way), same knobby looking rear differential, same drivetrain layout.

We went with the basic Outback package, which comes with air, power windows, remote keyless entry, alloy wheels, cruise control, etc.  All we wanted over and above that was the automatic tranny and the CD player, and we managed to get it for around $22k.

The cargo area is ample, and comes with a snappy little plastic bed-liner to save the carpet from getting stained and torn by bricks, wood, plants, etc.  It's a total workhorse.

Our experience after 16,000 miles has been very positive.  Driving it is wonderful.  It's quiet, has a peppy motor at 165 horsepower, although sometimes the transmission takes a second to choose a gear when you give the throttle a good poke.  It goes around corners quite nicely, benefiting from the full time-AWD, and without the top-heavy body lean you often get in a truck-based SUV.  The factory sound system is more than adequate, sounds good, gets loud, plays CD's, tapes and radio.  

Comfort wise, it's great as a daily commuter and a road-trip vehicle.  Two road trips from San Jose to the Los Angeles area have proven that it cruises comfortably at 80 mph with the air on, and still gets better than 20 mpg.  

There are only two potential problems with the car.  Number one, the cup holders flat out SUCK.  You can't get to the climate controls if you have a cup in place, nor can you get to the radio.  I've seen the Y2K model, and the new cup holder is a dramatic improvement.  I wonder if we can upgrade?

Number two....okay, it's a wagon.  Get over it.  It's not like you're driving Mom's blue LTD wagon with wood panelling on the side, for heaven's sake.  I consider myself a car guy, and I definitely think it's a snappy looking car with its recessed driving lights, subtle but noticable hood scoop, sporty rack and cool tail light design.

So there you have it.  I know 16,000 miles is not a lot, but if something heinous happens down the road, I'll update this epinion and include the pertinent breakage information.  After our last Subaru, though, I'm not going to hold my breath.  So far, it's been bliss.

UPDATE:  
We've now logged 23,000 miles, and the same complaints and strengths still hold true.  A couple of other things bear mentioning though.  If you do your own oil changes (or even if you take it to a non-Subaru mechanic), make sure you use a Subaru approved filter.  I used an aftermarket one, and the sucker burst because of the high pressure put out by the oil pump.  Also, the seats continue to break in after almost eighteen months of driving, and get more and more comfortable.  <br><br>
