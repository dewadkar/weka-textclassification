            I bought a Toyota Tercel in 1991 when I was in college.  I think that is one of my most sound investments.  My husband was in the military for four years and we drove across the US numerous times.  We have only had regular maintenance done and it has been over 130K.  The only problem it has right now is that there is a leak in the air-conditioner. I think that is pretty minimal considering all the wear and tear we have done in the last 9 years.
Our family out grew the car when we had our third child. My husband still uses the car to commute to work (2+ hours a day). I also loved the great gas mileage it would get and still does.  
This was a little small when we would try to go on a trip with two children but I don't think that what this car was made for :)<br><br>
