            I'd like to start off by saying that although my experience with digital cameras is extensive, this is the first over 3 megapixel camera that I've used. That having been said, this camera has given me the best pictures I've ever taken, and that includes my 35mm SLR's! I also own the Canon EOS Rebel XS(35mm) and The EOS IX(APS) so I was already pretty familiar with many of the manual features available on the G-1. 

Now that we've become aquainted with my credentials here is more info:

This camera has many manual controls that help you get a little bit more creative than point and shoot cameras. The ability to control the shutter speed and aperature come in really handy in low light situations. Have you ever had a subject that you wanted to capture at dusk or in a dimly lit room and you wanted it to look exactly like the way it does to your eyes? Well if you just use the "Auto" setting or a camera that doesn't have manual control it's not going to come out exactly the way you see it with your eyes. The built-in flash will probably cause the picture to look a little more evenly-lit from the front which is not the way you perceived it originally. For the advanced users out there, the ability to adjust the ISO setting will also give you more control.

Another thing I love about this camera is the pull-out LCD screen. Something that video camera users have grown to love but hasn't been seen on any compact digital cameras. It makes it easy to shoot over a crowd or even to take a picture of yourself. 

I'm getting long winded here so here are more features that I find important:

This camera accepts the IBM Microdrive. If it only had this feature it would still put it way ahead of its competition.

It has the ability to take 30 second AVI video clips. All I can say to that is, WOW!

It's 3x optical zoom lens can accept additional wide angle and telephoto lenses with an optional adaptor. A word of advice, the Canon adaptor is akward to use because it flares at the end covering the viewfinder and flash. I highly recommend purchasing the Lensmate adaptor available on the web for $20. It's made by a 3rd party company but it works flawlessly and doesn't cause the problems I mentioned.

You can add an external flash onto it's built-in hotshoe on top for even more creativity. Canon makes several flash units that are fully automatic for use with this camera although I personally recommend the 420ex.

It has a remote control if you want to prop this camera up on a tripod and take pictures using the remote. You can hook up the camera to your TV using it's AV inputs and view your pictures and videos on the big screen and use the remote to control the order that you see them in, etc.

There are so many more features that I'm sure that you've read about on the web or elsewhere and I could probably go on for days about how much I love this camera but I will summarize it like this:

If you want a camera that takes beautiful pictures and videos, the abiltity to use the IBM Microdrive to store thousands of photos before filling it up(depending on the setting) in a fairly compact body then this is the best value you will find.
