            My Dakota was bought for my business, and it has been a real workhorse for me.  It carries large loads without the engine bogging down.

I have a 1997 Dakota, regular cab, 2 wheel drive, 5 spd, V6, ac, cruise, cassette, ABS, and the SLT package.  It has a reese hitch and tows just about anything.

I bought the Dakota for its tow capacity, best in its class, and because it is just a good looking truck.  I have not ever had it in to the shop.  I have really enjoyed driving it, the transmission is good, the engine powerful, and the AC is fabulous.  Even on 100 degree days it cools you down to an icy level if you want.

The gas mileage is decent, 17 in the city, 22 on the highway.  My mileage went up by 3 mpg when I put on a bed cover.

My only problem is the gear shift.  Its location makes it terrible to have a third person up front.  There is plenty of seat room, just not enough leg room with the gear shift.  If you want to carry more than 2, get the extended cab.  It hasn't been much of a problem for me, because I usually am the only passenger, since it is used for work most of the time.  Also, the cup holders are right down there too, so I have had the shifter knock over more than one soda.  

Overall I love this truck, and really can not complain.  I like its looks, it runs great, never been in the shop, and gets me around in comfort.

Good truck for someone who wants a midsized pickup, and a good strong engine.<br><br>
