            This car is great. I spent 18 grand on it, and I'm very pleased. the interior is very well suited for my lifestyle. I love the cd changer, the speakers are lush, and the seats are very comfertable. The back seats are not as crampped as the Honda Accord Coupe's, but they do present a small problem for large people. The dead quiet ride tops everything off! It has amazing handling on the road and when turning on corners. What I love even most is that after I get out of the car and look at it, I feel proud and I trust the &quot;toyota&quot; name that is on the front bumper. Toyota produces quality cars, and I have bought one. You will like it, just try. <br><br>
