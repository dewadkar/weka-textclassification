            We have owned our grand caravan for almost two years now. We bought it as a program vehicle from our local dodge dealer. During this time we have enjoyed our mini van enormously. We live in Illinois and have gone to California and back, taken several extended trips to Minnesota and Wisconsin and have put about 50000 miles on it. It has been very reliable as a whole.

We did have to replace the power steering pump twice and although it was covered by warranty it could have been quite expensive was it not. We have 6 people in our family and find the vehicle spacious and comfortable. I travel over 60 miles a day to and from work and find I get acceptable fuel mileage about 20-22mpg. The engine (in our case the 3.3L) has allot of pep and I have never been afraid to jump right out in to traffic when necessary even when pulling our boat. 

The front and back air/heat is a nice option and it came nicely packed with many power features standard in our package such as power windows, air, abs, rear defrost, front back air/heat elect mirrors and others. there is lots of &quot;luxury&quot; for the money. It does seem to go through more brake pads than any vehicle I have ever owned as I have put three sets on so far, far too many in my opinion. I do allot of work on my own vehicles though and find it very easy to work on. 

I enjoy the visibility from our dodge all around view is clear and unobstructed. The controls are big and easy for the driver to find and operate without taking you eyes off the road. I think of all the mini vans that I have seen it is the most attractive of all the manufacturers (for a mini van of course). The ride is comfortable and smooth. I sit up high and like that I can see over other cars Iï¿½m behind. The seats remove and install easily. They have wheels that snap down and roll the seats out although they are a bit heavy, but that makes me feel they are solid and well built as well. 

All in all I would say it is a fine vehicle and would not hesitate to buy another one and will when the time comes.<br><br>
