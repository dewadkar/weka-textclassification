            I have had the Saab 9-5 SE V6 since April. It is a very sporty, not to mention safe, car.  It is quick off the line-- 0-60 in less than 7 seconds.  It's got a very high top end speed, and it is surprisingly smooth.  It's an aggressive car with an understated elegant look.  Most Saab's are the cheap looking hatchbacks, but this is different, with its 4-door, hatchbackless style, it is a great $40 thousand car.  What I really like is the creature comforts, which include cooled seats and glove box, seat heater for all of the seats, large trunk, Sekurit heat reducing windows, and awesome stereo system.  This is definetly a vehicle for almost anyone.  It's safe enough for kids, especially with its state of the art brakes, whiplash, and airbag system.  If your an adult it is elegant enough, yet makes you feel like you are still a kid.<br><br>
