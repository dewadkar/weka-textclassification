            My first car ever was a 5-speed Honda Prelude (I'm not sure what year). That car was a beauty, but my foot barely touched the clutch, even with the seat pushed all the way forward.  That car didn't last long, but it was the beginning of my love affair with Honda.
A few years, and cars, later, and I am the proud owner of a 1990 Honda CRX and a 1993 Honda Accord. My CRX is the best thing that ever happened to me.  My dad bought it off the showroom floor in '90. In '95 it became my brother's property.  In 1997 my Civic finally gave out and I talked my brother into selling me 'Rose'.
I have never been happier in my life. She lets you feel the road. She takes the corners hard, but looks real good doing it. She's gone 200km/h on the 401, and 250,000kms later she's still kicking up a storm.  I rarely ever have to take my girl to the garage (once the gas line froze) for anything other than regular maintenance. They're low to the ground and have a nice, wide wheel base so they're great during our Canadian winters. She's great on gas, which helps now that the average week's pay goes into the gas tank. 
I would recommend this car to anyone...in good shape for the summer, or as a winter 'beater' if it's a little rough.
