            This the best car I've ever owned.  Well it's the only car it's ever owned, but of all the car's I test drove recently only one was better than the Corolla, but when you factor in the price, this car could not be beat. Since it is a 5 speed, it is naturally extremely fun to drive and has great pick-up.  The front is roomy and very comfy, but I wouldn't ride in the back.  I'm 6'4&quot;, it wouldn't work out.  The car is whisper quiet and has a fairly good factory stereo system.  I had to have cruise added on, but if you want that standard, go for the LE model.  Also I doubt this car will need maintence because it is a foriegn product.  Sorry American cars. If you are looking for something affordable that's not a car you feel like you had to settle for, get a Corolla.<br><br>
