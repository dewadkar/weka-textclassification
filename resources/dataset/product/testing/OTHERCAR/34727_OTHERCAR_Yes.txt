            Slick and Seductive

     How do you explain the car you've always dreamed of??? Upon purchase of the Sebring convertible, I knew from the first drive home that this car was the one I had always wanted. It would be the first convertible I had ever owned. I had always talked myself out of convertibles because of having small children or because of noise but this make and model is a wonder.
     My Sebring is maroon with a tan top and elicits stares and compliments everywhere I go. It seems to be liked by all ages and there are very few things I would change about it, if I could. It drives and handles well, has serviced easily and is just a beautiful vehicle.
     I would probably add a larger gas tank because its driving range is not that fantastic. Also when it is raining, the drainage away from the two large windows leaves something to be desired. But both of these suggestions would not keep me from buying another Sebring.
     I have the luxury model with leather and a stereo system that gives me everything I want and more. The seats are comfortable for a long drive and adjust in everyway needed, especially the lumbar control for the back.
     If you are in the market for a car, especially a convertible, this one is the best I drove and looked at. The price is about what it should be for this vehicle and my understanding is that it holds its value well.<br><br>
