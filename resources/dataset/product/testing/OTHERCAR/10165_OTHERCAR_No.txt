            Ok, lets get something out of the way: This &quot;SUV&quot; is a Car. It does not go off-road. It will not go Off-road. If you should attempt to take this car off-road, it will most likely never return to the road, as the car suspension used simply cannot handle such abuse, nor was it designed to. Thankfully it is also not capable enough off-road to Get you very far off-road. Have I said Off-road enough? :)

What this *IS*, is a very high-quality, Luxury AWD Station Wagon that looks funny (Humble Opinion).

I was asked to test drive one of these for a friend this weekend, who thought it drove rather rough in comparison with his GS-300 (the sedan I do beleive this was based on), and wanted to know if it was the same for all SUV's. 

Well, after test driving it with him, I honestly don't see what he was complaining about. Maybe my rear end has been numbed by years of driving around in kidney beaters (Jeep CJ, FJ-40 Land Cruisers, etc), but I thought the RX-300 was as smooth a ride as any vehicle I've ever driven. It also felt very stable in the turns, (Due to that tuned car suspension it has) and the AWD didn't slip hardly at all in the snow. (I was driving it as close to the edge as possible, to see where the AWD would lose grip, driving it normally you would never know there was slip there at all). 

The interior... Classic Lexus. Everything looked expensive and I was admittedly a bit afraid to touch anything for fear of spoiling it. (It's a bit nicer than sheet metal dashboards I grew up with.) The seats were very comfortable, You literally could live in them.

The rear seats I found slightly cramped, Not that they would be uncomfortable on long rides, I just expected more room. Perhaps the rest of the vehicle affected my judgement here. ;)

It felt like something Richy Rich (the cartoon charactor) would own. Very classy, screaming money at every corner, yet practical to drive and surprisingly innovative in places. (I'm a gizmo lover, the center display console had me drooling.)

The engine doesn't suffer the same problem as it's distant relative RAV-4, in that it is strong, smooth, and very capable of moving the RX around with its 220 HP, 222 lb-ft of torque. (it can even tow a decent amount of trailer!)

Unfortunately there was no V8 engine option, though I doubt any prospective buyers would really care.

Cargo space was also not lacking, there was certainly room enough for a good deal of people and cargo, though I just couldnt' see anyone hauling around a few bags of dirt or a fern or whatnot in this luxo-ute. 

Reliability I'm certain will be tip-top, to match the fit and finish, as most of this vehicle stems from the GS-300, which also has a very respectable reliability record.

So. Is this just an overpriced Rav-4? No, the price you pay is certainly on par with the vehicle you get, and the engine power and towing capacity that I had trouble accepting in the Rav4 have been corrected, and the interior quality is second to none.

The question however, is who would buy a vehicle like this? 
The only class I could imagine would be people who have driven $50-60,000 luxury cars (Lexus sedans, Caddilacs, etc) for years, and want a good AWD wagon/SUV type vehicle for getting around in the winter-time, but cannot stand the truck-like ride of the Trucks. And those people might not like the ride of the RX-300, like my friend (though once I asked him just what type of hallucinagenics he was taking, and making several references to &quot;The Princess and the Pea&quot;, he decided the ride was good enough). 

For everyone else, there are better options out there that run around the same or less $ wise.

Would I reccomend this to my friends? well, apart from my one friend (who should really just give up and hire a driver anyways, I'm sure his parents would prefer that, as he wrecked their GS-400 in a blizard), no. The luxury appointments and carCarCAR ride just isn't worth paying $40,000 dollars for when you consider it doesn't go off-road, period.. If you have that much of a &quot;THING&quot; with the ride, buy an AWD Luxury Sedan; the extra ground clearence of the RX-300 isn't that much extra, and won't amount to much at all in deep snow. If you want real added ability in deep snow/etc, this isn't the vehicle for you, there are much better choices out there for about HALF the cost. 

So, *UNLESS* You are someone who ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE AN SUV and the ride ABSOLUTELY MUST BE AS GOOD AS YOUR OTHER LEXUS CARS, this is not a good value, and you really should look elsewhere<br><br>
