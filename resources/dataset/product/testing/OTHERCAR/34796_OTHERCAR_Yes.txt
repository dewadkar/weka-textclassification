            The 2000 Mitsubishi Montero Sport is easily the best-looking midsize sport utility on the market, and is priced right in the middle of the SUV market.  
The majority of drivers who buy SUVs don't drive offroad, so performance on the pavement is still a major priority, and the Sport excels on the highway and in the city.  The car-like ride dispels the notion of the truck-like harsh ride of many SUVs, providing a smooth, bounce-free commute.  
At the same time, it has great clearance, and is an excellent off-roader for the occasional 4-wheeling adventure.  As with every SUV on the market, it would need some modification to really become a hard-core 4x4 machine, but less than most other manufacturers.  
The 3.0 liter engine (173-hp) leaves a little to be desired, however, and I suggest the 3.5 liter (200 hp) for the extra horsepower.  Expect around 20mpg on the 3.0 liter, slightly less for the 3.5.  Also a high step-in for shorter people, and the side-steps don't help much, other than getting your pants a little muddy.  It's not the largest SUV for under $30,000, but it is roomy enough for a weekend trip with a family of four.  
The seats are comfortable even for long rides, as I experienced during a 10-hour each way for Thanksgiving.  Controls for the radio and comfort are easy to find without looking, and well placed.  
No manual shift is available, and the price is on the higher end, but you get a great-looking SUV, reliability, ground clearance, shift on the fly 4wd, and the smoothest ride.
