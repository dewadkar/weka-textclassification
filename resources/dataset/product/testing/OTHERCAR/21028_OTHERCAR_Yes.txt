            I recently purchased this camera and I am extremely happy with it's performance. I have a Sony Vaio laptop so I wanted to get a Sony digital camera (yes Sony, your marketing is working great on a consumer such as myself) so I can use the memory stick and drop it into the laptop directly. My biggest surprise (and most pleasant one) came when I wanted to download pictures to my home personal PC. The USB driver was incredibly easy to use. Also, instead of having to load a special software to download from the camera (as I did in past cameras), the camera itself became a "removable Drive" with the memory stick as the media. This means that should I want, I can transfer 64meg files with ease from my PC to laptop if I don't have a network connection at the time. 

When I use it as a camera instead of a 64 meg removable hard drive... it takes incredible sharp pictures. I would recommend buying at least a 64Meg memory stick for your camera as you will quickly fill up the 8meg provided quickly with the high quality pictures. I currently have my set on a fairly high resolution which still allows me to have about 100 pictures (more than I take in any given day). Another added bonus is the amazing battery life provided with the Lithuim Ion battery which is included. Other Sony Digital Cameras can use a similar battery, but it is usually sold seperately for 100 bucks (take this added cost into consideration when you buy your camera and this camera suddenly isn't so expensive). NEVER buy a digital camera that uses AA batteries as you will fall victim to always having dead batteries. Trust me, I learned this the hard way....

The Mpeg feature of this camera is great and at the low and medium setting lets you run for about as long as you want (I always stop it before it stops itself). On the highest resolution setting I believe the limit is about 5 seconds. I usually keep mine set on Medium setting as the low setting looks poor on a large monitor. Most lower sony cameras have Mpeg with no sound. I had the P30 before I bought this one, but I was not happy with the AA battery life, didn't want to pay extra for the ion battery, disliked the larger size, poorer resolution, and lack of sound on the Mpeg on that camera. 

I would recommend this camera to anyone and if you can afford it, it's a great little camera.
