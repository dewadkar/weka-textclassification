            I purchased the Civic Si in May of 1999 and at first I was pretty happy with it.  At first I was worried about the high revving engine, but that is what you end up loving about the engine.  Once you get the RPM past 4500 you can hear a beautiful hummm that you wont hear from other cars that do not have the VTEC.  I would buy it for the fact that it is the top of the line Civic out there and the 160 HP (Hourse power) is another reason too.  Civics without that 160 HP are pretty slow and do not seem to have the pick up as the Si would.  They are fun on the highways and can outsprint most other 4-cylinders out there on the market.  The lows about this car is the fact that the handeling in straightline is good and slight curves are good too.  Thats about it, I feel the back slip out making right and left hand turns on slightly bumpy roads.  And this happens a little more often that I would expect.  Driving with more than two person on this car and you can feel that it does not have that much pull as in torque... like about 110.  That is quite low, but revving the engine past 4500 and it should not be a problem.  I would stick with classic black because that color is timeless.  The Electron Blue can get old quickly and might get stolen faster than the black.
