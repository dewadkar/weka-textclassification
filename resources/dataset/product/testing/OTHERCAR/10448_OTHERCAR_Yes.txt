            The Acura Interga is truly a pocket rocket.  Not big, not bold, not flashy, but it can certainly hold it's own on the road.  

The power plant in mine is the VTec engine and it is awesome.  Red lines around 8100 RPM and gets into it's main powerband between about 6500 and 7800 RPM which makes it really fun to drive.  Off the line it is quick as I have chirped the tires in first, second and third gears.  Also, this thing handle like it is on a rail.  It is somewhat small with a low center of mass which contributes to it's exceptional handling characteristics.  

Just recently I broke my personal land speed record with my Acura.  I don't care what Road and Track says, I know what my speedometer said.  I was going from Santa Barbara to Fresno one night at about 1:30 in the morning on highway 41.  Just before Kettleman city there is a stretch of road about 5 miles long with a grade of about -1.5%.  I got that baby up to 140 mile per hour and roughly 7750 RPM.  It was awesome!

I've been in sports cars before which feel like they are going to rattle apart at around 120 and this car felt as stable as can be at 140.  An incredible ride in an incredible car.  Only bummer was the gas mileage at 140!   <br><br>
