            Being a big fan of SUVs, I have been privileged enough to drive a few models, including the Ford Explorer, Jeep Grand Cherokee, Chevy Blazer and the latest SUV toy, the 1999 Mercedes ML320.

I think the best feature of this SUV is that it drives like a sedan.  Despite sitting high off the ground, you'll feel more like you are driving a Ford Taurus than a Ford Explorer.  For passengers, there is plenty of room in the back, as DaimlerChrysler has ensured that all five passengers get the full luxury experience.

Some of the best features I got with my vehicle are dual power seats, built-in garage openers for up to 3 doors, CD changer, leather seats, and sun &amp; moon roof.  The best of all is the display on the interior roof that gives information such as gas mileage and time driven.  I think one of the most frivolous features of the Mercedes Benz are the dual seat warmers that make sure your &quot;biscuits are burnin'&quot; on the coldest of days.  For back seat passengers who like to put their feet up on the middle console between the front seats, you will undoubtedly be driven nuts by the fact that the rear windows controls are located here.  Therefore, the most prime real estate for your feet becomes a vast wasteland to these window-opening buttons.  For people who are expecting a lot of buttons and neat features in this car, you'll be disappointed.  Because the price tag of this vehicle is lower than most other Mercedes models, you lose a lot of neat features.  I also had trouble with the left rear passenger lock when I initially got it.

What impresses me about the ML320 is that you do not lose any storage over the other SUVs despite being extremely roomy.  When you fold down the back seats, you get as much cubic feet of storage space as the Ford Explorer and other mid-sized SUVs.  However, given that this car looks like a luxury vehicle from head to toe, I often hesitate to treat this car as a utility vehicle.

Mercedes has built itself a great vehicle with this one.  It always comes out on top in safety tests, and drives so smoothly that every passenger feels comfortable.  Despite the fact that you don't have as many interior features as a normal Mercedes car, I highly doubt you'll miss them.  If you are getting this car as primarily a utility car to help you with your dirty work, I would not recommend this car for you.  However, for the rest of us who want to use it to store more groceries, help move larger pieces of furniture, or use as a general passenger car, be sure to give this car due consideration if you are in the SUV market.<br><br>
