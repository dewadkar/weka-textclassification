            Bought the &quot;Sport&quot; 4x4 model delivered in May.  I was looking for something that would fit into a garage, carry 4 adults comfortably, and tow a utility trailer and 2-horse trailer infrequently.
Have the new 4.7 V8 (which Dodge spent millions on developing)with automatic transmission, front seat buckets, towing package (includes heavy duty battery, larger radiator, wiring and receiver), and premium audio with controls on the steering wheel.  Opted for 3.55 rear axle and ABS all around.
The ride is outstanding, this is a heavy vehicle (4,700lbs. equipped as mine)and is superior to my wife's '97 Grand Cherokee.  Fit and finish excellent.
This is a vehicle for a family who wishes to separate cargo from interior, the bed supplying ample room for hauling objects/materials that will not fit in the largest SUV, or that one would not want to put in an SUV.
The Dodge Dakota Quad Cab is neither a full sized pickup nor a small pickup.  It is a people hauler and materials hauler and suitably equipped will tow almost anything with ease.  It is in a niche of its own.
