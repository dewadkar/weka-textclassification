            The first time I saw the new 2001 Chrysler PT Cruiser, my head instinctively turned.  The car was sleek, attractive, and appeared to be built for speed.  The first car that entered my mind was the Plymouth Prowler, which had a sticker price hovering around $30,000.00.  I always admired the Plymouth Prowler, but would never consider paying the kind of money that they wanted for one.

My neighbor, Harold (badbonz0007 at Epinions) recently test drove the Chrysler PT Cruiser, and advised me that the sticker price starts around $15,000.00.  With this promising information, I decided to check into the car myself.  I really liked a lot that this car has to offer, but I think I will wait before making any decisions about buying a second car.  The following information was obtained during the course of my inquiries about this car:

<b>Supply And Demand Equals Gouging...</b> Several of the dealerships in my area have PT Cruisers in stock.  However, if you want to own one, you have two choices.  The first choice is to place a down payment of between $500 and $1,000 to put a car on order.  This will allow you to order the car with the features you want.  The down payment will be used against the total price of the car at time of delivery.  However, there is no guarantee that the car will ever be built.  The cars may also take between six and ten months to be delivered.  In other words, you give them money to (maybe) deliver a car...sometime in the future.  The other option available is to purchase one of the cars in stock.  However, the current asking price for in-stock PT Cruisers is between $3,000 and $5,000 over list price.  No thank you.  With a sticker price of between $16,000 and $21,000, the additional cost puts the price out of reasonable range.

<b>History...</b> Chrysler began production on the 2001 PT Cruiser around Valentine's Day 2000.  The production of the 2001 model will continue until late Summer 2001, when production will shift to the 2002 model.  The company plans to step production up to 150,000 units per year.  That number indicates that there will be plenty of these vehicles available in a year or two.

<b>A Little Secret...</b> Chrysler is slick.  The PT Cruiser is listed as a SUV, and meets the requirements to classify it as a light truck.  They created an extremely stylish throw-back body, that has created quite a frenzy.  The demand for this vehicle is currently very high.  So why is it important that this vehicle qualifies as a light truck?  Because this four cylinder, 150 horse-power, 2.4 liter engine gets decent fuel economy.  The PT Cruiser should average around 20 MPG in the city and 25 MPG on the highway.  The government has mandated certain fuel requirements that apply at the corporate level.  They use averages to determine fuel economy.  By selling a high volume of PT Cruisers, which get great gas mileage, they offset many of their gas guzzling-counterparts.  Does anyone want to take bets on the probability that GM and Ford will find a similar method of lowering their average fuel economy?

<b>What I Like About The PT Cruiser...</b> This car is flat-out stylish.  Although I do not care very much for the bumpers, the overall appearance of the car gives the impression of smoothness.  The colors are attractive, especially the blue model.  The molded body gives the impression of speed, although the 4-cylinder engine hardly gives the power that the appearance suggests.  The interior feels roomy, although the back is tight.  In fact, the back would be restrictive to large adults.  No more than two full size adults would be comfortable in the back seats, even though the back comes equipped with three shoulder harness seat belts.  The car rides smoothly and provides ample power for normal city driving.  The engine does not sound noisy, although I did not take this vehicle on the highway.

<b>What about the seats?</b>  The seats provide a wide variety of configurations, allowing for passengers or cargo, depending upon your needs.  The seats are removable, to maximize your cargo capabilities.  The seats are fairly comfortable, but could be improved.  I did not place my child's car seat in the back of the PT Cruiser, but I believe it would fit.  However, it might be tight to get some of the larger car seats into the back of the Cruiser.  All three of the rear seats come equipped with the three point restraint, which is a nice touch.  

<b>Why Rush?</b>  The PT Cruiser is an attractive, affordable automobile.  This vehicle provides plenty of new ideas that make it seem different.  However, the main difference is the attractive styling.  (The PT Cruiser also has a tailgate table that comes out the back of the car).  However, they plan to step up production, making the car more widely available in the future.  Furthermore, this car does not have much history behind it.  Although I am certain they modified an existing model of car, there are several new features to this vehicle that could end up being defective.  Therefore, it might be good to wait and see if there are any substantial recalls.  Another aspect worth waiting for is the 6-cylinder engine.  Although it is unlikely that this vehicle will be available in a 6-cylinder model anytime soon, it seems probable that one will be forthcoming in the next few years.

<b>My Final Analysis...</b>  I covered many negative points about this car.  I covered those points mostly to ensure that they get covered.  Anyone who has seen this car can form an opinion on the styling.  Either you love it or you hate it.  I think the concept is exceptional, and would really like to own one, I believe I will exercise caution and wait.  I love the interior styling, the accessibility of the instrumentation, and the ride.  The seats are okay, and the gas mileage is appealing.  However, the power is limited and the wheel base is low for an SUV.  I would not think about taking the Cruiser off-road, but it IS classified as an SUV.

If you want to be the first person on your block to own the PT Cruiser...fork out the extra 5 grand and buy one off the lot.  If you are extremely attracted to the car, but are willing to wait eight months for delivery, order one right away...the sooner the better.  There are no guarantees on when the delivery will take place.  If you like the car, and are interested in buying it, but you don't feel pressed for time, just wait it out.  In a year or two (as they step up production and their competitor's offer an alternative) the car should be available for under list, and may even come in a 6-cylinder version.<br><br>
