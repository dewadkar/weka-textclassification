            We actually have a 2001 Avalon, and I believe there was some small changes in terms of interior design.

It is a great car with only the Lexus 400 better in the Toyota family.  I would place this car ahead of the Lexus 300 because of the room available.  My dad who is 6ft 3 can't fit in the lexus 300 but has lots of room in the Avalon and that includes the backseat.

I wouldn't consider this a true luxury car but it does have lots of bells and whistles.  The in-dash 6 CD player and sound system is excellent.  The layout of the dash and front controls really makes the car seem big.  The car has excellent handling and braking with very little noise at Highway speeds.

Our car comes with every option, and it has all power seats,windows, roof, mirrors.  The backseat passage into the trunk is nothing but a small compartment, big enough for some skis or 2x4's..

My dad has owned Cadillacs and most recently an Audi A8, and those are true luxury cars.  The big difference is the engine and power output.  Both the Cadillac and Audi have over 300 hp, while the Avalon has about 210 hp.  This is noticed in acceleration, and is what hurts this car from being classified any higher.

The Avalon is a perfect family car, and offers very nice options.  The ride is smooth, and it has the looks of a Lexus.  We paid $41,000 Canadian, and believe we got a value.
