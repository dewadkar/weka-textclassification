            We purchased LS model 2 months ago and feel we made an excellent choice.  We compared this car to the Lexus ES-300, and we feel that the Buick is an overall better value.  This car came loaded with CD player and premium sound system, leather interior, dual climate control, power everything, and a 3.8-liter V6 engine that produces 200 hp.  I can directly compare this car to the Lexus because my mom owns the 2001 ES-300.  I find the Regal to have a smoother ride and more torque in the engine feel.  The engine is 8/10 of a liter larger and gets the same gas mileage.  In fact, the Buick engine will allow 87 octanes; whereas, the Lexus requires 89 or better according to manufacturer�s specifications.  This will save money in gasoline expenses.  The ride is extremely smooth and quiet.  My only drawback is the car is front wheel drive; therefore, it is a little lame on sharp turns.  This is probably a plus for most people; however, I live in Florida so snow is not a problem for me.  I feel that automobile�s with 200 or more hp should be rear wheel drive.
