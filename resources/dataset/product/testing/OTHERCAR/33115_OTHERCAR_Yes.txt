            The Chevrolet Malibu has a job to do, and it does it fairly well.  It's job is to get you to your job, and maybe the occasional road trip.  If you want to buy an American car, but say an Impala is too big and a Cavalier is too small, then you are in Malibu territory. The Malibu is bigger than a Toyota Corolla but smaller than a Camry. Think of it as an American Nissan Altima.

Inside the Malibu is what you'd expect, not roomy but big enough.  Dashboard and switches are typical GM, no surprises there. However it seems only fair to say that the quality of GM and Chevrolet's materials is steadily rising. All Buttons and controls fall easily to hand, no unusual stretching to reach anything. Heating and A/C are excellent, the A/C cooled the car off quickly even on a warm day, and the heater blows very hot air.  The automatic transmission shifter felt a little flimsy.  As in many General Motors cars, the stock stereo sounds better than in some much more expensive Japanese cars. The seats are firm but supportive. I would hesitate to use the word &quot;comfortable&quot; to describe them, perhaps &quot;adequate&quot; is more appropriate. Rear seat room is also adequate. Front seat room is the same. I am 6'1&quot; and I felt only SLIGHTLY cramped on a 2.5 hour trip.

Under the hood the 4 cylinder thrashes away like and old General Electric blender at a margarita party. It's noisy. The engine is mostly noisy around town. Thankfully Chevrolet has now made the 150hp V-6 standard equipment.  Once on the highway things smooth out a bit, but there is a fair amount of road noise. The transmission shifts firmly on upshifts and one can barely tell when the downshifts come. Overall build quality is very good. Very few rattles or squeaks, even on semi-rough roads. Handling is pretty good. There is some body roll when cornering, but not as much as one might expect from a car of this size.

Overall I would say the Malibu is worth looking at, especially if you are looking to buy your first new car. The Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla are better cars, but they are also smaller and often more expensive than the Malibu.  Not to mention the fact that you cannot get a V-6 in either Civic or Corolla. The big selling point is price/value.

The Malibu gives you a lot of standard features at a very reasonable price. For  less than a Civic you'll get A/C, power windows, power door locks, theft deterrent system, automatic trans., ABS and an AM/FM cassette 4-speaker stereo.  I would recommend this car, but just barely.  Price and value push me just slightly over the top. The Malibu is simply Adequate. But what a great value<br><br>
