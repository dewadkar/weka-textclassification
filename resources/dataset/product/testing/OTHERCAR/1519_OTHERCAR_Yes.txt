            When it comes to the Saturn, saftey is the most important feature. We bought the Saturn because we needed to get a car and that is what they wanted, a safe, comfortable, and easy to manage car. 
When i was 18 ( November 1998) i was in a head on collision with a Big metal ford f150 ( late 70's early 80's model). I crawled out of the car and the only injuries i got was a scratch on my left forearm and the mental anguish that my Saturn was totaled. 
The Saturn is a very economical and was voted in 1998 the safest car on the road, and take it from me it is. I would never buy anything else!
There were a few problems that we did have. I hate to admit but the Saturn was not the most perfect car, although it was close enough for government work.
There were only three things that we had to fix on the car: the sunroof, the alternator, and a rip in the seam of our leather seats.
The sunroof completely cracked due to forcefully hitting in when my mother had to slam on her brakes, the alternator went out for any normal reason an alternator would go out, and the back seat tore due to roughness with the leather and seams.
All in all i think that the Saturn is the most reliable, most dependable, and the most sensible car on the road, And, anyone that would buy one in my book would be a very wise person, They will be getting a great deal and a great ride.
