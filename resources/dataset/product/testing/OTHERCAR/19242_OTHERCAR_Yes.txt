            My husband and I bought this car when we went shopping for a lawn mower, and we came home with a car instead.  We drove this car once, and liked it a lot.  We needed a four-door family car.  We like how the seat fit us comfortably and we aren't little people.  It is very roomy even in the back seat with a carseat.  Two people can sit comfortably in the back seat with the carseat.  This car also gets decent gas mileage for a big V-6, around 23 highway MPG.  It also has great get up and go for passing, and turns corner excellent.  The brakes are our only problem because they needed replaced at 36,000 miles, but it stops on a dime instantly.  The ride down the road is smooth.  I would recommend this car to anybody moving from a sporty 2 door to a sporty 4 door family car.  I don't recommend this car to people with a lead foot should buy this car because it gets up and goes quick!<br><br>
