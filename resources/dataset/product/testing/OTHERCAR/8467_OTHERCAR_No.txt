            I've had my C-3030 for about three years. About two weeks ago, though, my frustration with this one boiled over and I gave up and bought a new digital. Much better models are available now from several manufacturers. Although I am experienced at traveling, I am still in the amateur ranks when it comes to photography. Although there are some nice features to this camera, eventually the pure frustration of dealing with several of the glaring deficiencies caused a primal scream and a total replacement. 

The lens cap is a very annoying portion of the camera. I eventually bought a retainer for the cap to avoid losing it. As a result, it dangles and tangles and is very annoying. The alternative is putting it in your pocket or some other place. Truly the lesser of two evils with no satisfactory solution. 

But the real annoyance was when I bought a new computer using MS XP O/S. The old Olympus software didn't work. The old software wasn't too bad, but the new "improved" software that it takes to make the camera work on Windows XP is simply awful.  I had to buy an "upgrade" to make the camera work on XP. It's hard to write "upgrade" and not start laughing. I can make that statement since I bought my first IBM PC in 1983 and am reasonably skilled in navigating software. The interface and methodology of dealing with storing and retrieving pictures is ghastly, non-intuitive and clunky. My reaction after trying it was "For $35 they sent me THIS?" This would not have been good software in 1995, let alone 2003.

Shutter lag has been addressed elsewhere. It's bad.  

This is not intended to be a full review of the camera. Up until we had to get new software to download it to XP, it served "ok." In other words, any Nikon product of similar technical aspirations is better. But if anyone is considering buying this and isn't prepared for some truly bad software using XP, then they will be shocked.
