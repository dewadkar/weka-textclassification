            I bought this camera in response to a XOOM.com e-mail.  I didn't get the 'lowest price' that I've seen some of the other owners of this camera, but I am delighted with it just the same.  I have never had a digital camera, nor used anything but a 'point and click' camera.  But this camera was so easy to use, very easy instructions, and it came with everything....   cables, A/C adapter, software..  One other item I'm purchasing that did not come with this model is the FlashPath adapter for Smartmedia memory cards.  This is a 3 1/2&quot; diskette looking adapter that does away with all the cables.  You simply slide out the memory card from the camera, slide it into the side of the FlashPath adapter, then put it in your floppy drive on your computer and start downloading! 

All in all, I think this is one of the greatest for the money digital cameras that even a total novice like me can use in minutes.<br><br>
