            ...by my husband...I did not want something &quot;big&quot;. It drives like a smooth car and goes like a work horse! I love it! I tote my 11 month-old around in it... Generally I love it! The only thing that I wish it had is more leg room in the back seat. Overall? Excellent ride!

We got some serious snow in the past few weeks and although bad weather is not the reason we bought this SUV, it REALLY suprised us with how it would just go and go...We also have a 96 Chevy Truck 4WD and it was SO much smoother than the truck!

We bought this in November '98. It had 28K miles on it and it was 34 months old...We paid $19,000....We feel like we got a real deal because of the low miles...<br><br>
