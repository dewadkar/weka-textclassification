            My wife wanted it. It's a nice looking car , especially for a hatchback. I went with the Silver. I loaded up on the options , going with the moon-roof , Monsoon stereo system , heated seats , custom V.W. rims , power everything , etc. My biggest regret was not getting the leather interior. Which brings me to my first complaint. 
The material that the seats are made of , is almost that of a lint-brush. Not that it looks like it. But it acts as it. My seats are covered in lint , fur , hair. The material is a lint magnet! I know it sounds strange but it's true.  I have never had a problem like this with any other vehicle I've owned. I have to buy some seat covers. It's the only thing left to do. I'm sick of cleaning them everyday.
Staying on the interior subject. This car was designed for smaller people , or women. I'm not a tall man ,5'9". I do however weigh 200 lbs. The driving seat is compact. I feel very cramped driving this thing. I cant imagine how people bigger than myself feel.

Outside.
There's only 1 problem I could detect on the body. 
Where the windshield meets the roof , there is a gap . It should have been sealed off or shielded. This gap is nothing more than a trap for insects , dirt , and other small debris. At first I thought that my car was messed up and the factory forgot cover it , but I went back to the dealership , and sure enough that's how they're made. It's tough cleaning bugs out of that thing.

Drive.
Ample power. Poor handling , but that's to be expected from a hatchback I guess. While making sharp turns , like U-turns , the car leans a lot. Even if your going slow.

Overall.
It's a good car. Interior lighting is cool. Average gas mileage. Great warranty. Mechanically sound.
