            The 97 SC1 is a great-looking, practical sporty (read: good-looking but slow) car.  I enjoyed the affordability factor of this vehicle and the service level at the dealership, but the vehicle simply did not perform well enough to be a long-term keeper.

The vehicle was quite comfortable for me, as I'm over six feet and had little trouble on long trips.  The woven fabric seats were actually quite comfy, but provided little in the way of lateral support.  The sound system was great, but the inability to pause CD playback is a bit thoughtless.  For a coupe, it had a decent back seat... the &quot;presenters&quot; for the front seat belts were a nice touch.  The plastic body panels were also cool due to the inability to ding them.  Problems in urethane-land, though... the plastic panels suffer from the same problems as plastic bumper covers... they stain and streak if not polished regularly, they crack if they're impacted heavily and require replacement, and they aren't as protective in side-impact crashes (in my observations as a body shop manager).  The good thing about the plastic panels in crashes is that they're easy to replace and reduce replacement labor times and cut repair bills and thus, collision insurance rates.

The drivetrain is surprisingly smooth and refined for the single cam inline four.  The automatic transmission shifts smoothly and almost imperceptibly.  The cruise control is easy to operate.  And the fuel economy is superb, particularly on the highway.  The trade-off is extremely lackluster performance.  The 100-HP engine acts taxed just to accelerate from a stoplight to 45MPH.  The suspension is adequate, but not sporty by any stretch.  Maintenance runs the gamut, too.  The oil filter is nearly impossible to reach, as it is located behind the right inner CV joint; At the same time, the transmission has an oil-filter style filter that can be changed without cracking the pan loose, making for super-easy transmission service.

The dealership made purchasing and having my car serviced easy and pain-free.  I couldn't reccommend the experience more.  The vehicle was also very reliable and had no problems.  It was also fairly reasonably priced, but when you consider that for a couple thousand more you could get a base-model Eclipse or other import coupe with better performance (if you can afford the insurance), it doesn't seem like such a wonderful value after all.

This is a car of extremes, with good positive points and bad negative ones.  It's mainly for folks that want a good-looking coupe without the insurance premiums or gas costs.  But that don't mind poor performance.  And I'm a performance kind of guy.
