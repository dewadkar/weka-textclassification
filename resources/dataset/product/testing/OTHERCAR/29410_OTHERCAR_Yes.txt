            This is what every car should aspire to be!

I have owned my Speed Yellow 2000 Boxster for 2 months now.  I opted for the 030 (sport suspension) black full leather, deviating carpet and a leather stitching (yellow on black), sport package, 18" Turbo Look wheels, and HiFi sound package.  All said and done we were at $51k before tax.

I have to say, after driving the M3, Mcoupe, MZ3, s2000, SLK, and a few others.... in my opinion...this was the only option.  

Handling.  Although a few of the above mentioned cars can keep up (and pass me) in a straight line,  when it comes to the twisty Mulhulland Drive Roads above Los Angles the Boxster is a tough challenge.  I have never driven such a predictable and fun to drive car that goes and goes.  I have joined a newsgroup that sets up weekly drives (30-90 miles) in the hills on the weekends and have put a good number of miles on this car now.  You can drive it hard, then harder, and then do it all over again.  The racing heritage of the Porsche is really prevelent in its ability to be pushed and pushed without missing a beat.

I used to drive my BMW in the same hills on the same roads before getting the Boxster and the one thing i notice is this cars ability to remain stable no matter what the condition or the speed.  After a good run in the BMW I would be really concerned about brake fade and oil consuption.  Not even an issue here.

Seats and interior are first rate quality.  The dash.... originally I was a bit concerned about the goofy triple dial with the far left analog speedometer and "Digital" speed readout under the middle Tach.  I thought this was a bit videogamish when I first looked at it, after driving the car for a while, I can say that I would hate to drive a car that was configured differently.  The primary controls are second to none!  The stereo, convertible top, climate control, defrost, etc all work as you would expect from a $45k + German car.  The top goes up and down in 15 seconds and is one of the coolest and easiest to use mechanisms I have ever seen or used.

People have compained of the rear window getting too dirty, I have not noticed this yet. 

The one and only compaint that I have with the car is about to go away.  The stock HiFI stereo setup is garbage for a car this expensive.  I will replace the front  dash and door speakers with the dropin ADS woofers (about $500) and build a subwoofer enclosure for under the passenger foot well ($400).  Of course I will need to change out the "Nokia" amplifier that is currently in the car (sounds powerful enough for a nokia cell phone (see my review of one if you are interested).  I will need a good amp, I am going with ADS which will cost about $500 too.  So all said and done I will spend about $1500-1600 to get this thing to sound right.

The Boxster is my only car, and aside from the bright, noticable color I have no complaints using the car every day for my commute back and forth to work.  It is amazing both how quiet and how loud the car can be, and all you have to do is control the volume with your right foot!  

In summary, I have to say that every car should drive as well as the Boxster.  People would be happier and safer as the car really does improve ones driving ability as well as the degree to which traffic, global warming, Republican Presidents and the slow internet connections effect ones ability to enjoy their day.
