            We just recently purchased a 2001 Chrysler Town and Country. The body style is a bit different, but for the most part the same. This was our first Chrysler van, after owning two Ford Aerostars and being disappointed in the last one. We decided to leap into the world of the Chrysler minivan and we are glad we did.

We love everything about this van. The two sliding doors, the 3.6L V6 has plenty of power. The CD player and sound system is awesome and the ride is one of a kind. It does not even feel like a minivan. 
We also liked Chryslers 4.9% financing and the fact that this van is not overpriced. In fact, we found that the Dodge version of this costs much more.

Other things we like are the built in child seat tether anchors and that it is LATCH equipped. LATCH seats are not readily available, but when they are this will come in very handy. Another we love is the nice navy blue interior. It does not show nearly as much dirt as the gray we had previously. The seats come out easily and the front has a lot of leg room. This is good because no one our family is under 5'9&quot; tall. The three zone climate control is very nice and it keeps the whole van comfortable.

I cannot say enough good things about this van. Buy it!<br><br>
