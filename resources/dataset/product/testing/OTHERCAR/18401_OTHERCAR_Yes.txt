            I received my Mazda MX-3 GS for my high school graduation in 1993. My grandfather had purchased it in 1992 and driven it very little.  He decided to give it to me for graduation (lucky girl, huh?).  

My grandfather originally purchased this car upon my recommendation.  Of course, the recommendation of a 17 year old is based entirely on "Wow Papaw, I love how this one looks."  My family has owned several Mazdas and have always had good luck with them.  He test drove this one and fell in love himself.  It's a peppy little car that is fun to drive.

I really don't know much about cars, so I can't give many technical details unfortunately.  I can only speak from my own experience and about what details are important to me.
<b>*That Bit of Technical Stuff I Know:</b>  The MX-3 is available in a four or six cylinder model.  Mine is the six cylinder, the GS model.  The GS model also has a spoiler standard.  I think the car looks much better with a spoiler, but that's personal preference.  The V6 engine is very peppy.  I get great acceleration, and the car can go fast (not faster than the speed limit, of course *grin*).

Mine is a standard.  My Dad convinced me when I was 16 then men love a woman who can drive a stick.  I believed him and got hooked on the stick before I found out that he was just lying to me because he wanted his automatic back!

<b>*Reliablity: </b>I need a reliable car.  Like I said, I have no knowledge about cars.  My father has always handled my car issues in the past,but unfortunately, he is now a distance away.  I have had very few problems with my MX-3.  It is now 8 years old, and it has been in the shop just 2 times.  One time, the problem had something to do with a hole in a spark plug wire which was replaced.  The second time was last summer, and while I don't quite understand what the problem was, it was inexpensive to fix (less than $150).  It has had tires and mufflers replaced and has regular oil changes, but I consider those to be regular maintenence issues. 

<b>*Comfort and Size:</b> This car is extremely comfortable for me.  In fact, I'd describe it was almost perfect.  I am very petite female who has trouble being comfortable in many cars.  The MX-3 seat is just perfect for me.  I frequently make car trips of 1 to 5 hours with no problems at all in this car.  My father and brother who are under 6'0 tall are also comfortable when driving and riding in the front seat of my car.  A friend of mine is 6'5, and he is very cramped in the front seat.  If you are going to be transporting a basketball team, this is not the car for you!

The problem with the comfort in this car comes from its tiny backseat.  Even I can be cramped in it!  It is fine for 2 smaller adults when going a short distance, but a long trip would be extremely uncomfortable. 

Along the lines of the car's size is the trunk. It looks tiny when opened, but I have transported a lot of stuff at once.  It is a hatchback and the seats fold down, which allows for a lot of storage space. You couldn't pack the luggage for a family's week long vacation in, but it definitely serves my purposes and more.  I've compared the trunk size to my friend's Toyota Celica, and mine is bigger.

<b>*Handling: </b> I love how my little car handles!  My model has a manual transmission.  I love to drive a standard and can't imagine this one in an automatic!  It has quite a bit of pickup and is very peppy.  It drives very smoothly, even for an eight year old car.  

<b>*Looks:</b>  I definitely want a car that looks good!  I love the looks of my MX-3.  My car's color is called Elegant Beige.  It's really a shimmery beigish gold color.  It's very pretty.  The interior upholstery is one of the nicest I have seen.  It is brown, almost tweed like, with threads of brighter colors running through it.

I like the sporty looks of this car.  Even though it is 8 years old, I feel like it looks very modern.  I think it looks quite a bit like the newer and popular Mitsubishi Eclipses.  It's also somewhat unique.  Because Mazda didn't make this car for many years, you don't see that many out on the road.  I like being a little different!

<b>*Other comments:</b>
*It gets great gas mileage!
*I also have the power package which includes the windows and locks plus I have a sunroof. I love these options and can't imagine a car without them.
*One other problem with this car...it has a couple of blind spots in the back due to how the windows are shaped.  I find that I really have to look closely behind me and sometimes crane my next to make sure I'm not backing into anything.  It's a minor annoyance to be because I've learned to deal with it.  Anyone driving this car should be warned of these though.

I love my little MX-3.  It has been the perfect car to take me through college and law school.  I still get compliments on how great it looks, even though it is 8 years old.  I am getting to the place in my life where I will need a slightly bigger car.  I will really miss my MX-3 when the time comes to sell it.
