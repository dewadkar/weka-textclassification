              Nissan really hit the jackpot in 1989 when they introduced the third generation Maxima. Stylish and powerful it was a less costly alternative to cars such as the Acura Legend and Mercedes 190E. It had a smooth 160 horsepower 3.0 liter SOHC V6 called the VG30E and good amounts of performance and luxury. In 1992, Nissan gave the SE model a new 190 horsepower DOHC engine with variable valve timing control(VTC) called the VE30DE and enhanced the performance even further making it more of a Japanese BMW 525i. GXE Maximas kept the 160 horsepower VG30E engine from before. 
  
  My Maxima is a third generation model 1993 SE, and despite its age it still competes well with today's cars. Over the years Maximas and this third generation series in particular has built up quite an enthusiast's following. Let's take a closer look at Nissan's "Four Door Sports Car". 

Powertrain: A 
The Maxima SE's 3.0 liter DOHC VE30DE V6 is a gem. This was an all-new engine for 1992. Exclusive to the SE model it is good for 190 horsepower. With 30 more horses than the less expensive GXE model, the SE feels more confident when merging and more spirited as well. Mated to the smooth four speed automatic, acceleration is effortless and downshifts are quick when you need to pass. Some of today's V6 engines are still not up to par with the VE30DE in terms of power delivery and smoothness. 

  The engine sounds great and is super smooth. Fuel economy is around 23MPG on the highway, about 19 in the suburbs, not too shabby for a V6. And to top it off, this engine is chain driven as opposed to most other cars in this class. A timing chain does not have to be replaced as often if at all while a timing belt needs to be changed at 60,000 miles at the tune of at least $200. 

Steering/Handling: A+ 
I can't say the Maxima handles and steers quite like a BMW because it doesn't, but for an older Japanese design it is impressive in it's own right. Grip from the 15-inch tires is good, and steering is quick and precise. It has a firm substantial heavy that contributes to the overall sporting mood. It can be a little too heavy at times but I much prefer it to the overly light steering I find in many of today's cars. The four-wheel independent suspension not only provides good handling but also a decently smooth and comfortable ride. 

   The four-wheel disc ABS brakes are faultless and have a nice progressive feel. They are very easy to modulate and stop the car in a short distance. 
  Just as a note, the newer fourth and fifth gen Maximas (1995- 2002) use a beam axle for the rear suspension rather than an independent setup like the third gen. While handling is still at least fairly good its not quite right nor is the ride as stable as the '89-'94 third gen. Hopefully the return of the four-wheel independent suspension the all new sixth gen '04-?? Maxima will back the winning ways of the third gen models. 

Interior: B+ 
This is a 1989 interior design. Even when compared with many of today's cars, it still looks classy, better than in some new cars and way better than today's Nissans ('02 Altima is shameful!). The seats are a little flat, but very comfortable even on a long trip. The head restraints on the front seats tilt forward. This is so nice on long trips as it makes a good support for you neck. No more cramping! If that's not your thing they also tilt back. 
  
   The driving position seems strange at first having more of an outstretched arm effect than some cars but it actually is better than Camrys and Accords from that era once you get used to it. The rear seat is roomy and comfortable and it includes a fold down armrest.

   The interior plastics and fabrics are more than worthy to grace the interior of a new car. The interior pillars are covered in cloth rather than hard plastic which is a classy touch. 
   Most of the controls are well laid out. The stereo has good sized buttons, as does the climate control system. The sliders for the fan and temperature work smoothly. The steering wheel is a bit thin by today's standards but its wrapped in leather and feels good. The cruise control buttons are on the wheel. Under the radio there is a damped action sliding compartment good for a cell phone or other smaller items. 

   That sliding compartment also has an almost useless flimsy dual cup holder that slides out separately. It holds cans pretty well but not much else. What many have done (myself included) is replace the compartment with the cupholder assembly from a 1986-1998 Saab 9000. It includes two GOOD cupholders and a sliding coin tray. Its easy to install, looks great and only cost me about $25 on ebay. 

   The door lock switch is good and intuitive but there is only one on the driver's side. I'm not crazy about the power window switches. They are partially blocked by the door pull and are not well lit. I am getting used to them though.
  
  Any car with an airbag should not have motorized seatbelts. Honda was able to add normal seatbelts to the 1992 Accord when they gave it an airbag, why didn't Nissan do the same with the Maxima? Well actually they did but only in Canadian spec models!  But at least the ones on this car work a lot better than the ones on my old Mazda MX-6 did. There are quick and have not gotten stuck, at least not yet!

   The Bose stereo is very good. It has clear crisp sound, great base, and a good tape deck. As nice as it is, it is not much better than some other less costly systems I've had in other cars plus it lacks a CD player. If you find one with the Bose system don't complain, you'll like it but if some other system is already there I don't feel its worth putting in a Bose unit. There are better and cheaper alternatives. 
   
   The trunk is pretty huge. Part of my job involves taking a large number of packages to the post office at the end of the day. I always have plenty of room for them. It is too bad the rear seat does not fold down, nor does it have a pass through for ski equipment. This is not a big deal for me but it may be for some of you. 

Exterior: A+ 
Ok, I can just here it now! You're probably thinking to yourselves why is Mike giving this older Japanese design such high marks for styling? It's actually quite simple. I was observing cars in the parking lot at work. One of the lawyers in the complex has a 1991 Maxima GXE. A brand new fifth gen. ('00-'03) Maxima drove up and parked right next to it. The cars at least in profile look amazingly similar. 

  In fact many of the details of the third gen. are superior to the newer models. It has a well-proportioned muscular yet elegant look to it. The third gen. Max has always been an attractive car and it's nice to see that it manages to still look modern a full 13 years after it was introduced.

Things to look out for:
 There are a few things to watch out for when looking for a '89-'94 Maxima. These Maximas have weak exhaust manifold studs. Having a broken stud will cause some noise and a slight drop of mileage. They're not cheap to fix, figure anywhere from a few hundred to $1500 depending on the location of the broken stud. But they usually don't cause a problem even if they do break.

  Automatic transmissions on VG30E equipped pre-1992 models were somewhat problematic. For 1992 Nissan beefed up the synchros and the tranny is more reliable. 
   Window regulators tend to fail fairly often. It was a due to design flaw that Nissan denies. They are made of plastic and tend to crack. When this happens your window will fall into the door and not come back up. They are about $60 for the parts. 
   If its a '92-'94 SE with the VE30DE engine a good thing to do would be to make sure the engine does not make a ticking/clicking sound. Mine does not do this thankfully. This noise usually means the VTC system is bad and its big bucks to fix, perhaps $1500 or so. There is much debate on whether fixing the VTC system is required or not. Many choose not to and have no problems other than the noise.

   I mention these problems to you not to scare you away but to make you aware of things that MAY happen. Many Maximas have not had these or any other problems for that matter. In mine and many other's experience with this car reliability is great.

Overall: A 
You can get one of these Maximas for not a lot of money. A '94 SE (the newest of this generation Maxima) would only run you around $6000, probably less. This for a car that performs as well as most new cars in this class. My family and I have been very impressed with the Maxima. Its a fantastic performance value and a must see for any driving enthusiast on a budget who needs space and comfort. Four Door Sports car? You bet it is!!
