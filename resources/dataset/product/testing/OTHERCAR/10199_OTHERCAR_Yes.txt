            Many people dismiss the Lexus RX300 as being only a high priced Toyota.  They need to experience the vehicle obviously. I drove several other SUVs before driving the RX300.  None could compare to the comfort and smoothness of the RX300.  It rides like a car.  It accelerates and corners with the likeness of a car.  A powerful car at that.

Another key point is the price.  Fully loaded with all options the RX300 goes for approximately $37,500.  That price isn't much higher than other SUVs after you add their options. 

I've had my RX300 for almost a year now.  I've driven it from Vermont to Oregon in total comfort.  After that road trip I can tell you honestly the car is all about comfort.  I've tacked on more than the usual amount of miles in this year and I have had absolutely no problems with my RX300.

The dealership is just as classy as the RX300.  The Lexus company has strict standards, therefore, the sales and service people strive to be the best.  After my experience with several dealers I can tell you that the Lexus dealerships surpasses them all.  Purchasing the car was a pleasure.  Negotiating the price wasn't even a hassle.  We were treated like royalty when we took delivery of our RX300.  When I've gone in for check-ups there was always a loaner RX300 waiting for me.

I could go on and on about how great this SUV is.  The RX300 speaks for itself.  Take a test drive and you will know it.  After all the RX300 did receive the first ever SUV Of The Year Award in 1999.<br><br>
