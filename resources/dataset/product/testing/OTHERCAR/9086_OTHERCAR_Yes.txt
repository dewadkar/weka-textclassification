               When I graduated from high school, my mom wanted to buy me a car. We  decided to go check out the Kia Sportage. I always did admire the car whenever I saw someone driving one. 
What I love about it was how comfortable it was for me ,how easy it was to park. I also like the fact that it doesn't guzzle gas like most SUV's. What I hate about is is that I can't trade it in. 
The reason for this is because the car is basically 'topsy-turvy'. I owe more on the car than what it is worth. I like my Kia, but now I can't afford it. I believe it's a nice car, but I does have problems. 
First of all, the ignition had a problem, whenever you tried to get the key out. It was found that there was a defect. The people from Kia sent me an certificate for a free repair of this problem though.
 Another problem with my car is that, it is so easier to break into.I realized that if someone really wanted to all they had to do was to go through my rear window flap. Easy access! 
I believe that it would be a nice car to drive if it was a hardtop, four door Kia Sportage. I don't know, how much longer I will be able to keep it. I'm scared that it will become a piece of junk, by the time I pay it off.Anyone want to buy a car?;&gt;<br><br>
