            This is a wonderful camera.  The company I work for has one and it is one of the most popular pieces of equipment in our office.  It has been used so many ways.  A mediator was coming in for a staff retreat and need pictures of all of the staff members - piece of cake - someone went around with the camera and took all of the pictures and printed them out on a color laser printer and they looked fabulous.

This camera has a lot of options when taking pictures.  You can set your picture quality as well as chose from color, sepia and black &amp; white.  I like being able to save the pictures to floppy disk so that you can just pop the disk out and continue shooting rather than having to run back to your pc to download the photos before you take more.  

Unfortunately this item is out of my price range but if I had the money I would not hesitate to buy one for myself.  <br><br>
