            I have owned my '91 Miata since January of 1991, it was my first new car purchase. I recently traded in my 1999 BMW M Roadster and although they are in different leagues, I wasn't that sad when the Roadster left. I never even thought of selling the Miata, they just get under your skin. It is not the fastest car on the planet, but boy can it handle the corners. I have setup my Miata for autocrossing and I feel more confident in it than I did in the BMW. The Miata just becomes a part of you. My Miata has never stranded me and if you do all the maintenance you should have very little problems. I recently test drove a new (2000) Miata and I think I like the previous generation better. The new generation (M2 as the Miata people call it) is a great car, but I think they have lost some of the &quot;soul&quot;. The new version is &quot;better&quot; in many ways, but now it seems more like a Honda or Toyota. I still like the rounded shape of the earlier years. My baby does have some rattles but after 9 years of autocrossing and track days I can't complain. The Borla exhaust (cat back) makes the Miata sound much more aggressive, of course this means the car tends to drone a bit on long trips. The Koni shocks make the Miata handle the corners better at the expense of ride comfort. This is what makes the Miata such a great car. If you like the car can be setup for racing, or just for tooling around on nice days.
This car is definitely not a snow car (even with winter tires). The hardtop can lengthen the usable time but I really don't enjoy it on a snowy day. If you can find an older Miata in good shape (with all the maintenance done) I would definitely think about a nice summer fun car.
