            The Geo Prizm (now called the Chevy Prizm) is a sister car to the Toyota Corrola; they are built in the same factory in California, on the same frame and engine/transmission, but the two companies slap on their unique body styling and interiors.

My Geo Prizm came with an optional 1.8L 4-cylinder engine (instead of the standard 1.6L) and an optional 4-speed automatic.  I don't know how big a difference the engine makes (though in this class any difference in power is a big difference).  I do know that the 4-speed automatic makes a big difference, and you should search for it.  The 3-speed automatic struggles and makes a lot of noise at highway speed; the 4-speed is quiet in its overdrive gear.  I can't recommend the 4-speed auto highly enough.

I have 105k miles on the car now, having done virtually nothing but recommended maintenance on the car.  The engine works great, and the transmission shifts smoothly.  

The problems I've had with the car:
1)  Least expensive but most annoying-- the dashboard knobs to adjust heat/cool settings and airflow break every couple of years.  I've had to replace them at least twice.  At $10/knob, they aren't very cheap (for little plastic knobs).  They don't break as a result of mishandling; they just seem to break after a while probably due to degradation as a result of heat/cold cycles.
2)  Paint on the hood is chipped like crazy.  I haven't had this problem with my other cars, and to be honest, I haven't seen this kind of problem on other Geo's.  Either there was some quality control error on painting my car at the factory, or perhaps the maroon color of paint had a defect.  I don't know, but it shouldn't be like this.
3)  I broke the antenna while backing up through low-hanging branches.  Unfortunately, the antenna can't simply be replaced by unscrewing &amp; replacing.  It feeds through the frame between the driver's window and the windshield, and has to be replaced as a single unit, including the wiring to the radio (behind the dashboard).  You need to get a professional to do this for you, to get it right.

Overall, though, I'm very pleased with the car.  I regularly get mileage in the 35 mpg range, even topping 40 mpg when I need to travel distances on the highway.<br><br>
