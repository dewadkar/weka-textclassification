            I am a true import fan as almost every vehicle I have purchased has been from Europe or Japan.  I am particularly found of Hondas and Toyotas.  I have owned two Accords (1983 and 1995) and a Camry (1986) and all of them have survived relatively problem-free for over 100,000 miles each.

Unfortunately, my 1995 Accord is rusting out due to a faulty seal for a replaced rear window and the clutch is giving me trouble for the third time.  So unfortunately, my beloved Accord will have to move on to a better life within a year.

In the meantime, I have begun my car shopping.  I tried a Nissan Altima over Christmas break (see my review).  The car is like a "mini-rocket" as the acceleration is unbelievable for such a car and the design is sure to turn many heads.  I liked the vehicle except for the relatively cheap interior and the fact that I can't get a manual transmission and anti-lock brakes with a reasonable exterior color from any dealer stock.  As a result, I have nixed the Altima for now.

That leaves me with two obvious options: Accord and Camry.  When I was shopping for a car in 1995, I first tried to get a Camry.  My requirements for the vehicle were a manual transmission and ABS.  I was told by one dealer that there was a car available in New York and that they would get it for a small deposit.  Well, the car never showed and I ended up walking out and buying an Accord.

When I saw the redesign for the 2002 Camry, I was quite impressed on what they had done to modernize the look of the vehicle.  The vehicle barely resembles any of its ancestors, which is good because fewer people will be able to look at the car from the side and say, "That's a Camry".  In fact, according to a magazine I read, the Camry's new structure is the first redesign since 1991!

I was lucky to find and test drive a manual Camry SE.  Unfortunately, the color was black (I do not want a black or white vehicle) and did not have ABS.  In fact, they were <i> begging </i> me to buy the car under invoice because it had been on the lot for months.  I of course refused because of its lack of equipment, but I did drive the vehicle.

<b>Performance:</b> The 157-hp engine worked better than I thought.  It is not as peppy as the Altima's 175-hp engine or the 200-hp engine in the Accord V6, but it works noticibly better than my current Accord (which has only 7 less horses than the Camry).  You can barely hear the engine, even at 4000 RPM.  The manual transmission shifts confidently and does not click at all like the Altima.  The sport suspension helps keep the ride smooth yet fun.  I am glad there are 16-inch tires on this car, though, because this car is capable of burning rubber.  Despite its performance, the car gets exceptional fuel economy (24 city, 33 highway), better than any of its competitors!  The V6 picks up well, but is over 40 horses behind both Nissan and Honda (for 2003).

<b> Interior:</b> Toyota really put a lot of thought in to this vehicle.  The seats are much more comfortable than the Accord and the power seat is a great help.  The gauges in the SE version are black text on white background, but I don't like the way they light up with the headlights on.  The radio and A/C controls are designed so that they can be operated without taking eyes off the road.  In fact, I like the fact that the radio buttons are large and above the A/C (instead of below it) so they can be operated by feel without reaching down (which makes up for the lack of steering-wheel mounted controls).  The JBL radio and 6-CD changer seem to work well and the sound is high-quality (the radio unit is actually made by Harmon-Kardon, which makes designer radios for BMW).  The rear seats are very roomy, but aren't much bigger than the Altima or Accord.

<b> Value:</b>  The Camry is a solid value and is definitely a good buy.  However, I disagree with Toyota's method of pricing.  First, the packages that Toyota builds in to cars (the "popular equipment" packages) raise the price considerably (they also add a rather large fee for regional advertising, which I think is outrageous and unnecessary).  In fact, to get the same features in the $25740 Honda Accord EX-V6 (see my review), one would have to spend almost <i>$30000</i> for a Camry.  Fortunately, the packages I would get would only add up to about $23600, but might require a wait to get a car with my options.  Also, I am surprised that ABS is not standard as it is on an Accord (it is also harder to find a Camry with optional ABS) and am surprised to hear that a lot of people don't want it.  I believe that ABS is a must-have safety feature and should be standard.

The Camry will not attract masses of people, but its attractive styling and excellent performance (for a family car) will turn a lot of heads and attract many buyers (like me) who want a little sport with their family-hauler.

As for my purchase, I could not get a manual transmission Camry with ABS and side airbags unless I took a chance and waited 6 months for a car from Japan.  I decided to purchase a V6 automatic.  I did not want leather seats, but the dealer again reminded me that there was a chance that my order would be rejected and cut his profit on a vehicle on the lot.  It was too good to pass up.

The first days with the car have been great.  However, two things still bug me.  First, the brakes are not real responsive and it takes longer to stop than with my old car (I don't know if it will improve after it is broken in).  Also, word of 2000 and 2001 V6 engines failing due to oil sludge (possibly due to a flaw in engine design) makes me a little nervous.  In addition, the front end made a "clunking" sound when the steering wheel was turned for the first time (after starting the vehicle).  The dealer had to replace the ABS actuator, but it took them a day to find the problem and another 10 days to get the part (so I had to leave the car again for a day).

The most disappointing aspect of the V6 is the fuel economy.  I do about 85% of my driving on the highway (50 miles a day) and I only get about 23 MPG.  The EPA quotes 28 MPG on the highway and others in AutoWeek magazine have reported up to 30 MPG.  The dealer has not offered to do anything about my situation (even after an e-mail to Toyota's corporate office), claiming that it takes 15000 miles for the car to "break in".  I don't believe them.  If this continues, it may be an excuse to drop this car early since the 2003 Accord V6 is supposed to get 30 MPG on the highway (the 4-cylider manual is supposed to be even better than that).
