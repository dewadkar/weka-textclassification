Well, the old Previa was getting a little long in the tooth, and we kind of wanted one of those driver side sliding doors...so we started looking around.  

Settled on the Sienna, since the Previa was a really good vehicle.  Since the V6 is standard (now) we figured power wouldn't be a problem.

We decided on the LE version, since the XLE didn't really have anything extra we wanted (Not for $3000 more, that is).  This year, I was prowling about the web and checked out Carpoint.com.  Nifty site, let me check out lots 'o' stuff, and submit a quote to a local dealer (Marina Toyota).

Good decision...they offered me $500 over invoice!  Took the wife down, bought the van.  The seat configuration is interesting.  On our old van, we could fold up the seats...on this one, you fold them down for a smaller/flat footprint; you can remove them fairly easily.  The dual zone A/C is cool, if the passengers get &quot;uppity&quot; you can override the kids choice and run the fan the way you want.  Decent power, excellent wide view out of the front and sides.  Nifty audio controls placed on the steering wheel (of course, now I can't do it by feel, have to look down to figure out what's what...but that should change...)

There is an extra power port under the lighter, so both of our cell phones can charge at the same time.

Since this is smaller than the Previa, and my head was hovering near the ceiling on that one, I was a bit apprehensive about the smaller size of this one...but it is actually roomier inside!  There is more &quot;hood&quot; on the Sienna, so you aren't sitting on the motor; this let the designers reconfigure the front seats.

Overall, and excellent choice!  <br><br>
