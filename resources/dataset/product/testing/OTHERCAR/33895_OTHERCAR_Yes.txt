            My wife and I wanted an all wheel drive SUV for occasional trips to the local mountains and desert.  Since we do not tow items like Seadoos or boats our search focused on the so-called compact or "cute utes."  Our main concerns were safety, passenger room, comfort and style.

We looked at the Subaru Forester, the Ford Escape/Mazda Tribute, the Saturn Vue, the Honda CRV, the Toyota Matrix/Pontiac Vibe, the Jeep Liberty, the Mitsubishi Outlander and the Kia Sorento.

EXT:  The SUV resembles a more stylish but compact Jeep with its aggressive side "swooshes," rakish roof rack and 16" alloy wheels.

INT:  The driver position is superb.  The hood is low and the windows seem almost panoramic, especially when checking traffic before changing lanes.  The seats are extra firm.  The headroom is spacious for all passengers.  The legroom is outstanding in the front.  People over six feet are fine in the back unless they are behind another six foot driver; then they may be cramped.  There is enough "trunk" cargo space for camping gear for five.  The XS model we bought has almost "near luxury" creature comforts including automatic climate control, heated front seats and an awesome 6 disc CD changer/radio/cassette player.

POWER AND RIDE:  The 165 horsepower "Boxer" Engine, which lays "flat," is a peppy, smooth and powerful powerplant when mated with the five speed manual transmission.  This was our choice made all the easier by Subaru's unique "Hill holder" that literally holds the SUV on the steepest hill without sliding backwards before the clutch engages.  After some easy quick shifts you are hitting 60.  On the highway 70 and 80 seem like 50 or 60.  The SUV is nimble, even sporty.  It turns and handles like a compact car.  It hugs the road.  It has none of the tippiness of a typical SUV.  You are always in control because of its responsive engine, braking and handling.

SAFETY:  The Forester XS has four wheel ABS, four wheel disc brakes, heavy duty suspension with stabilizer bars, all wheel drive, front airbags, side airbags and head protection.  It has 16" tires, de-icers for the side mirrors and windshield, fog lamps and running day-lights.

RELIABILITY:  According to consumer magazines the Subaru Forester has an exceptional reliability record.  Its standard warranty is bumper to bumper for 3 years/36,000 and 5 years/60,000 for the engine and drive train.
