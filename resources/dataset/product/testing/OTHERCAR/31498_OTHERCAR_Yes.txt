              I've never really been fond of Nissan Sentras. They were cheap little basic 
transportation cars, and they made no bones about it. Usually bland and boxy looking, they were almost the epitome of &quot;economy&quot;. Until now.....After 
seeing quite a few of those new commercials, I got curious and one day just 
decided I needed to try one of them out for myself, and see if they were 
living up to the hype the commercials were putting out. 
 
 
  After pulling up outside the dealership, it didn't take long for a salesman to come to my assistance. I found a pretty candy apple red SE that appealed to me.
 

  They have really come a LONG way in looks. The look is contemporary and mainstream, if not striking. Even more so in SE guise. It ups the ante with 15-inch alloy wheels on performance tires, dual power mirrors, fog lights, a dual chrome-tipped exhaust, and a tasteful rear spoiler. It won't stand out, much, but it is a good looking little car.


  Also with the SE you get the bigger engine, an all-aluminum 4-cylinder. A 2.0-liter making 145 hp (@ 6400rpm) and 136 lb-ft of torque (@ 4800rpm) versus the base 1.8-liter making 126 horses (@ 6000rpm) and 129 lb-ft of torque (@ 2400rpm). Ok, so you obviously aren't going to challenge any Camaros or Vettes, but it's adequate. The 2.0-liter is rated at about 24 mpg in the city and 30/31 (depending on whether you have the 4-speed auto/5-speed manual). The 1.8-liter should get around 26/27 mpg in the city and 33/35 mpg on the highway, also depending on which transmission you have.
   

  OK, enough specs, let me tell you about the <b>DRIVE</b>.

 
  I liked the looks, pretty sporty, and the interior is no exception. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised by it's quality and the detail put into it. Such things as titanium faced gauges, leather wrapped steering wheel, and chrome(like) touches throughout the black interior are nearly unheard of in the sub $20,000 category. I loved the seats, they were firm and sporty and covered with a very nice black cloth. Must say some of the more comfortable seats I've come across.
  

  The dash is like a scaled-down Maxima, with alot of Euro influence visible. There's this great cubby on the top of the dash above the stereo and climate controls that you can stick miscellaneous larger things in such as sunglasses. I LOVED the gauges, being made out of titanium, during the day they're white-faced with black numerals and apparently at night they reverse these roles. I could not test that though, because it was daytime. Everything you need to know is there, and on the SE package, a tach is included. The optional 180-watt stereo wasn't bad, pretty simple controls, and had a CD player. The climate controls were also simple, and this car had the coldest air conditioning I think I've ever come across. I thought icicles would sprout from the interior, it was that cold.
  

   Visibility was good, with plenty of greenhouse available and decent-sized mirrors.
 

   Interior space is good, as looking at the car from the outside you would not think there was much, but for the size, it's good. Taller people might want to avoid the back seat though.
 

   It rode very nicely, I was surprised. It was sportingly firm, and held the road like it was glued, but did soak up more of the annoying things in the road such as minor joints and road imperfections. The steering was weighted nicely, needing little to turn, but not numb. It was also fairly quiet, I heard little outside noise besides the engine and some slight wind noise. 
  

  As stated earlier, this particular car was outfitted with the optional 2.0-liter and 4-speed automatic transmission. Now I've driven more powerful vehicles, and this definitely wasn't one of them, but once you slammed the gas down and the motor had a chance to get the revs up, it didn't take long to get there, and pretty quickly too. The 2.0-liter moved the car more than adequately and with little fuss around town, but entering upon highways really worked it. Once going though, it'd do 80 all day long like 50. The auto was a good one, shifting quickly and smoothly, and did little hunting, if any at all. However, I would pick the 5-speed if I could, if just for a bit more fun while driving and to make the most of it's available power.
  

  It also stopped confidently, as it was equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes, with no noticeable brake fade.
  

  It was pretty well loaded, SE package, power everything (windows/locks/mirrors), remote keyless entry, cruise control, 4-wheel disc brakes, only lacking the $1200 sunroof option to bring it at about $16.9k. VERY well equipped for UNDER $20,000 is something to brag about, and the fact that Nissan did such a good job on it is astounding for the price. The quality is there. 

 The revamped '00 Sentra is now a contender, and in my book, one to be looked at closely.
