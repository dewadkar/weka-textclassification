            When I first bought this camera, I didn't think that I would be able to figure out how to fully use it.  After using it for the past week and a half, I found that it was actually quite simple to use.  The price was expensive for most novice photographers like myself, but after seeing the type of quality pictures it can take, I was glad that I had spent the money on it.  The only thing I recommend when purchasing this camera is to also purchase at least a 128MB Memory Stick in addition to the 32MB stick that comes in the box.  I am able to take about 15 pics in high resolution with the 32MB Memory Stick which has me running to the computer multiple times during a photo session.  Other than this the only other problem that I can say is really a "problem" with this camera is the way you have to select the memory options, such as deleting a picture off of the memory stick.  They could have added a better "button" to use to select different menu options, other than the one that comes with it.  Even the one that comes with it gets easier and easier to use as time goes on. At first the button was a little difficult to use.  All in all this is a great camera and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to be amazed by the wonderful pictures it can take.
