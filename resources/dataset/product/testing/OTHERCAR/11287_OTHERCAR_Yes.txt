            I have been looking for a new car to replace my Altima when it goes, whenever that may be(see my review).  I had a big list, Vibe, Matrix, Elantra GT, Sonata, Saturn L-Series, Ranger, Protege5, Sentra and Altima.  It has taken some time to narrow the list down, but after reading upwards of 200 reviews on various websites, and finding maybe 5 or 6 reviews that they had mechanical problems, and still had glowing words, I was pretty sure.  I started dealing with a dealership about 2 hours away.  So far, we are down to $15,500 for a 2003, with manual tranny, sunroof/6 disc pkg, ABS/Side SRS pkg, auto-dim rearview mirror with compass, rear floor tray, and bumper guard. So last week, I test drove a 2002 white 5 spd, with sunroof.

OUTSIDE-
 Well, when it comes to looks, this is one hot car.  I still can't believe it's in this price range.  Everything about it works, and to me, is one of the only cars that looks good in every color offered.  I have been told that the Laser Blue has been discontinued, but that may be heresay. I like the oversized fog lights, and large headlights (which won a Consumer Reports farthest beam test, over several luxury Xenon cars.).  I think my favorite view is the rear, just plain awesome.  When I do buy one, I will be tinting the windows.  I think it just adds the right look to the car.  I would not recommend the sunroof guard, as I don't feel they do much, but block space.

INSIDE-
  I love the interior of this car.  Feels spacious like a minivan, you sort of sit up like in a SUV, but still feels like a little sports car.  Most controls are within easy reach.  I found the radio knobs a bit farther than I prefer(they are at my fingertips in my Altima, when my hand is on the shifter).  I have to agree with many reviews I have read.  The radio is lacking.  I am not big on a system, if it is CD, and play music, I am fine.  But I just didn't like the sound.  I believe this has been remedied for 2003 with additional speakers and an optional subwoofer in the spare tire area. Wind noise was moderate with sunroof open and windows down. Climate control was easy to use, A/C worked great.  Optional on the car is an autodim mirror with compass.  It may seem unnecessary, but use it once and your hooked.  One minor thing I love is the on/off for the cruise.  It's on the cruise pod, but underneath, out of the way.  But when you shut the car off, and restart it, the cruise main doesn't turn off.  A minor thing.  I enjoyed the silverish faced gauges, I think they are easier to read than black.  Didn't get to see them at night, but looks cool in the pics. I liked the leather wrapped steering, offered good grip.  The 2002 had a metal topped shifter, which I didn't like.  It would reflect sunlight off of it, and glare in my eyes.  2003's have a leather shifter now.  I thought front area storage was adequate.  Didn't use the cupholders, so no comment on them.  I love the back seat/hatch area.  The salesman showed how you can flip the bottom seat cushion up(after removing the headrests), and fold the seatbacks down for a flat cargo area.  I liked the cargo tray covering the back from prying eyes.  I have read complaints about it not being easy to stow, but I like it better than those vinyl pullovers.  I found the seats to be comfortable, and was easy to find a comfortable seating position.  I drove the car for an hour and a half, and had no complaints. The ride was a bit stiff and bouncy, but one of those things you should expect with a car like this.  I am probably one of the few who hates power seats, so I am happy not to see them in this car.  New for 2003 is a leather option, which is relatively inexpensive, but looks and feels nice.

ENGINE/POWERTRAIN-
   Having read the many complaints of lack of power, I was somewhat hesitant on what I would find.  I had the full knowledge that it had 130 hp and 135 tq(my Altima has 145 hp with 150tq)so I guess I was expecting a slow, wheezy engine.  Was I in for a shock.  It had the bat-outta-hell feel.  I thought the amount of power was perfect.  Enough to zoom around, get up to highway speeds, and pass people.  Doing 80 of the freeway, I floored it to see what would happen.  I was up to 100 with no problem.  Felt like power to spare, and very stable.  So, to those of you who say "not enough power", I disagree.  All I can say, is you know what you are getting.  I am a hard core stick shifter.  No other options in life, not even those fake manu-matic autos.  I loved the light clutch in this car.  Shift was fun, and precise.  Coupled with the engine response, this car was one of the best I have ever driven, short of the Corvette Z06 or Jaguar XKR(I used to work at an exotic car dealership), which is saying alot.  The brakes were excellent.  They felt solid, and stopped effeciently.  This car did not have the ABS.  I have no actual knowledge of gas mileage, so I may be out of turn here, but from the window sticker, I feel it could be better.  As for reliability, form the reviews i have read, this car is bulletproof. I hate to sound unpatriotic, but I will never buy another American car until they can at least match the reliability of Mazdas, Nissans, Hondas, and Toyotas.  And of course, the handling.  This car reinvents the phrase "corners on rails".  Seriously.  I could go on and on about the handling, but instead I will just say this, GO DRIVE ONE!

OVERALL-
  All I can say is this is one heck of a car.  It is everything-looks,fun to drive, well equipped, good value-in one car.  GO DRIVE ONE, you'll be hooked.
