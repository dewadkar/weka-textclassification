            The best consumer gripe letter in the world is about this car - the Neon - worst car ever manufactured.  Glue oozes from the windows, engine blows repeatedly, bad computers, bad sensors, bad paint, the defects go on and on.  Goto http://www.furrowcious.com/ebay/neon_letter_eBay.htm to read the letter - seriously funny, seriously bad car.  Even though it had new paint and most of the car repaired, I couldn't sell it without bartering for a couple cell phones and movie tickets.

With this car, you can expect your head gaskets to blow every 30,000 miles.  Its a good reminder that you need new tires.   

You can expect the oxygen sensors to malfunction on a regular basis, costing $200 every couple of months.

The check engine light is a standard feature, and lights up the cabin at night with a comfortable glow.

Can I say enough about why you should NOT buy this car?  If you own it - sell it, sell it today.  Donate it to a charity you don't support.
