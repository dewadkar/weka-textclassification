            This upgraded version of the C-2000 Zoom improves upon an excellent camera. After reading many reviews and trying out some cameras, this camera was my choice. Easy to use with a large LCD screen and many features. The original camera had complaints concerning on/off switch, difficulty with batteries and like all digital cameras using up batteries; all these concerns have been addressed and battery life is much better than expected. This model allows for recording of short Quicktime movies (but no sound) and while it is very easy to use in program mode has many other features including the ability to change ISO, aperture priority ,external flash and macro mode. Has a 3X zoom plus 2.5 digital zoom. Included is a remote control and rechargeable NiMH batteries and charger. Not included is a USB connection, but a serial cable is included. I have purchased the Olympus USB SmartMedia reader and it is simple to download images to my Macintosh.
The camera is small and easy to carry but does not come with a carrying case. This was my first purchase of a digital camera and I have found it easy to use with excellent picture quality.<br><br>
