            My sister is the owner of her third Saturn SL2. She just loved her two first Saturn's and never had problems with them and kept. She had regular maintenance done on the car.

She and her mother in law bought identical Saturn SL2 cars at the same time. In different colors. My sister is having transmission problems from day one. She has taken the car in for service four times. The car only has 16,000 miles on it. They keep telling her there's nothing wrong with the car. I personally know better than that. I have ridden in the car on numerous occasions. The car jerks something awful. I can only assume it has something to do with the transmission.

My sister and I both have pre-existing back injuries and the jerking around really bothers our backs and necks. We think Saturn is fooling around trying to wait till the extended warranty runs out. ( If you buy a Saturn be sure to purchase an extended warranty cause your gonna need it)

She asked them at the service center why they couldn't just replace the transmission and was told &quot; oh no that would cost us $4000.00&quot; well what about the $17,000.00 plus the extended warranty means nothing.

Well if they call that family and a new kind of car company I want a divorce from this company.

She is still dealing with them to date and still getting the runaround. She thinks she might have to sue them for injuries sustained from the jerking of the car.

My sister use to sing Saturn praises but not anymore. I don't think she will ever own a forth Saturn and I don't blame her at all.<br><br>
