            I own 95 and 98 LR Discos and they are both great. I acquired my 95 used in 97 and even though it was not well maintained, at 111,000 miles it runs very well. My 98 has a lot less miles (42,000) and has never needed any service (other than scheduled maintenance). 
I've always loved Land Rover and it doesn't hurt that I have friends who work for LR North America and that I have my own mechanic. Because I travel often when I received poor service at a dealership I drove 180 miles to another. Lemons exist in all automobiles (my best friend's dad got a new Jeep Grand Cherokee after 3 bad ones in a row). 
Try conducting research before purchasing a vehicle. LR's are known for their interior noise, if you want a truck that handles like a car buy the Mercedes mini van.
I find it interesting that LR made a cheaper product to make LR's accessible to more of the public and now the public is unhappy.  Skip the Discovery and move up to the Range Rover (I'm giving my Discos to my nephews over the next two years) and buying a Range. <br><br>
