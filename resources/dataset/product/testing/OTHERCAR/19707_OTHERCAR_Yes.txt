            <b>WHY REVIEW JUST SUSPENSIONS: ?</b>         


I have read many reviews on automobiles from aesthetic, interior, power, warranty, options, etc. points of view.  I believe an important, but always neglected area, though is from a steering and suspension system point of view, and let me tell you, most people are missing a very important part of researching a prospective major purchase by not being well enough informed in this area. You can find some very well engineered and built suspensions these days, but all the same some very weak and suspect ones in my experience, and my purpose is to help you make a more informed decision. After reading my reviews, read those on other aspects of the car you're looking for, from the members here at epinions, and make your choice.

<b>AHHH...THE RINGED ONE:</b>

 The Planet Saturn is the sixth...  Oh wait, this is supposed to be about about the car ?  Let me start over.
  
I have been planning to review the Saturn line for a while now, and since I just worked on one this past Monday I figured it was now or never. Ever since the inception of this break away from the General Motors stable, people have been intrigued by the advertisements and mounting reputation of the so called &quot;fourth of the big three&quot; auto manufacturers.  It seems there is no median in the Saturn reviews. Either folks love them or they hate them. Not much riding the fence is perceptible.

<b>THE SATURN SUSPENSION:</b>

What you have in the suspension system on the whole Saturn line is a very basic, straight forward design. Nothing cutting edge, no experimentation in wild race car copy configurations, no &quot;hey check this out&quot; high zoot materials. It's all flannel shirt, work boot, meat and potatoes simple.

 Some wives call their husbands &quot;predictable&quot;, <i>(mine)</i> I like to use the terms stable, steadfast, dependable. Some call them &quot;boring&quot;, <i>(not mine)</i> , but I like to say humble, not flashy or excessive. Where am I going with this ? The Saturn suspension by all accounts may just be called boring, but it is steady and predictable, err.. steadfast.

The composition of this steering and suspension system consists of, rack and pinion steering, and a very basic MacPhearson strut set-up for the suspension. Nothing special, but in the same vein, nothing horrible either.

It is a true four wheel independent suspension, and the ride quality reflects that, smooth for the category it is in. I'm not talking BMW or Mercedes here, but not Ford Escort either. The materials involved are run-of-the-mill also. Regular steel and cast steel, no aluminum super parts like on some high tech imports. It may seem like I am deriding the Saturn, but in reality it is more of a direction toward convincing you of a basic trustworthyness.

<b>THE FRONT COMPONENTRY:</b>

Up front, like mentioned above is Rack and pinion steering. The outer tie rods are not greasable, as is with almost every other car on the road in the low to mid range class, and only a small hand full of times have I had to replace these. The inner tie rods on the other hand, I have never had to replace. This is a testament to not only Saturns choice of quality parts, but I believe also excellence of engineering.

 The only reason for an inner tie rod to wear is because only a small portion of the bearing surfaces are in contact. Any middle school physics will tell you a smaller contact patch will erode quicker than a large one. If the angle of operation is steep, the bearing surfaces will not completely contact each other, and premature wear will result. Saturn has obviously done its home work as evidenced by me never having to replace not-a-one.

The lower ball joints are like the Ford Escort in that they are integrated into the lower control arm. You don't just replace the ball joint when it gets loose. You need to replace the complete &quot;control arm&quot;. They are not a greasable item, but are of such quality that they should last near the 100,000 mile mark.

The struts up front are also of more than usual quality. Aftermarket manufacturers will recommend replacing OEM shocks and struts and 12,000 miles.  Of course they want to sell parts, so they will tell you factory units will be weak by this time. Some vehicles will actually need attention this soon, but Saturn has chosen quality here also. I have tested suspensions on Saturns with over 100,000 miles on them with nary a whisper of needing strut replacement.

Springing is also acceptable, with not one broken coil to date, and the steel they are constructed of seems to hold up admirably. With some vehicles, the coil springs weaken appreciably at about the 50,000 mile mark and the ride height is already far below spec. The Saturn keep its level very well.  The anti roll bar on front is of medium diameter. Enough to keep you on the level, but not really enough to be driven like a sport sedan.

<b>FRONT ADJUSTABILITY:</b>

The only angle Saturn allows for adjustment is the toe in/out angle. The struts mount in the steering knuckles via a two bolt set-up, so you can at least get some camber adjustment through the slop in the bolt holes, but not much. If the camber goes low due to the inevitable  spring weakening your only real option is to replace the springs, but this seems to be a rare occurrence . Oh you can get kits where a smaller diameter bolt is installed, but this is treating a symptom, not the cause, plus it seems a little backyard to me, not completely professional.

<b>REAR COMPONENTS AND ADJUSTMENTS:</b>

The rear struts are exactly as the fronts in that they are of the same high quality for it's class, and the mounting and adjustments are the same. Not actually adjustable but a little boost in bolt slop is always appreciated to tweak it as much as possible as the springs weaken.

Ditto for the springs on the rear and also the anti roll bar. Everything back there mimics and compliments that of the front.  Rear toe is adjustable via a set of eccentric cams and do a very good job in keeping the tires pointed in the right direction, and are firmly mounted to keep things where you point them post alignment.

<b>IN CONCLUSION:</b>

The Saturn I mentioned earlier which inspired me to write this review was actually the worst one I ever saw. It needed two lower ball joints and two outer tie rod ends. The tie rods were $100.00 and the ball joints were $250.00 plus, of course labor and alignment.  This is though, the exception rather than the rule.

It seems like a lot of people don't like the Saturn for various reasons, none of then due to an inferior suspension and steering system. I wish this suspension could be mated to a car where everything is of the same quality for its class and one could have an in-expensive dream car.

Why some $45,000 cars have a dime store suspension and some mid grade cars have an excellent suspension should be given a government grant to study. Some day some one will mate everything together and will become rich and famous. Until then, balance out the good with the bad and wait.
