            As a fairly new driver, I was anxcious about taking the Sable out for a drive. The huge mass of metal was a threatening site compared to the smaller, more compact cars I was used to. How was I supposed to maneuver this monster? But to my relief, it was surprisingly easy.

The thing that shocked me the most was the incredible amount of pick up it has. I wasn't expecting that from a family car. I had assumed they were all large and slow and handled like a shopping cart, but it was far from the truth. The Sable is a very responsive car which allows for those quick maneuvers and it is set on the ground well, meaning it is secure in those tight turns. It's a powerful thing too. Even up those steep hills, it goes from 0-60 in good time.

It has even more advantages as a family car. There's plenty of room for a whole lot of luggage and plenty of space for the kids. There's a lot of room in the driver and passenger are too. It's a very comfortable car for long rides. Because it's so powerful, and the frame is well constructed and secure, it's safe to hitch up the boat to it and haul it to the lake. <br><br>
