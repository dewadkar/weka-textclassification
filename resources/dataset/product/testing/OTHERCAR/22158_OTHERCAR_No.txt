            Yes, I drive Buick Regal 1991. But think about it, do you really need a car in the city? No, a car is a hassle. Nevertheless my Buick has 70, 000 miles on it, and that's not bad for an American car. Actually it's very bad, because it means that it's time for transmission problems, and that's what I'm going to talk about.

As you already understood, my main concern is transmission. I have to notice that all American cars have bad, unreliable transmissions,  and that's a big deal, because it costs a lot of money to repair or rebuild transmission. About $1000 to $3000, which is a lot of money.

Just  a month ago  I went to my mechanic, to change my transmission fluid, but I was in for a bad surprise. He told me that the new fluid is going to act as detergent, and it's going to destroy transmission, so I better off  leaving the transmission alone, until it breaks down completely, and then I should replace the whole thing. I have to mention that mechanic is a good friend of mine, so he didn't tell me that just so that I would come running to him when my transmission is gone. So, I'm pretty sure he's right.

So, right now I'm waiting, for my transmission to break so I can fix it, but let me tell ya, it's very nerve racking, trying to guess if your car is gonna break down while you're driving to work. However there's a good chance that it's not gonna go soon, and it will run for a while. That's the worst part- not knowing when it's gonna go.

Aside from that I had a few electrical problems, which I got fixed for a relatively small price.  My coolant is leaking, got  a few squeaky spots and that's about it.

Now let's see what's good about this car:

Size: very roomy car, you can fit three people in the front seat, four in the back, they are not going to be comfortable, but it works. Seats are soft, and uncomfortable in the long rides, unless you're a driver, in which case you only get a back-ache. So, size is good, but seats are uncomfortable, go figure.

Engine: that's the best part of the car. 6-cylinder, 150 hp. Not that much HP, but we all know that HP doesn't really matter, but what matters is the quality and cylinder quantity of the engine. Unlike transmissions, domestic engines are very good, and this is not an exception. Despite 150 hp, it's very powerful, and good enough to outrun any 4 cylinder out there. Might I also add, that domestic 4-cylinders suck. So, don't buy Ford Escort. Please. It's a piece of you know what. Moped is better.

Buick usually comes with a lot of options, which of course include, a better than average stereo system, all power, and a bunch of other useless stuff like lights mounted in the backseat.

One thing that should be mentioned, is that Buick is not a  very controllable car, it's a Russian Rulet on Ice, &quot;Is it gonna stop, or not&quot;, it's heavy, big, and brakes are a little dull. So be careful.

Now here comes my conclusion: don't buy Buick Regal if you want reliable transportation, get something Japanese, Toyota, Honda, Nissan. Or even something Korean, it's not as bad as Buick. Buick is no good in the long run, and I'm starting to understand that now. Unless you like luxury powerful cars, and Buick is certainly able to fulfill that aspect.
