            I bought my dodge because I wanted a vehicle with rear wheel drive. This eliminates the problems of front wheel drive maintainence. CV joint replacement is a major expense. I plan to keep my truck a long time and get value for my money. I have the contractor package which means I do not have power windows or locks. Must of my cars have had a problem with power windows at about 100,000 miles. My interior is nice but not over priced. Three adults can ride comfortable in the front seat. The back seat is cramped for adults for a long trip, but is fine for short jaunts. My granddaughters love it. It is a little difficult for older people to get into the back. The front seat pulls forward but the track is hard to get over. And my seventy year old mother has a hard time climbing up that high. We have a stool for her to step on.  But when the streets have a lot of water after a storm, I really appreciate the height of the vehicle. And it gives the vehicle the look of an SUV.  I have plenty of room to carry whatever I buy. I find it easy to drive. People who are not accustomed to a full size vehicle might have a problem. It does take a full size parking space. I am short 5'4&quot;.  I am glad I got this truck. It is good value for my money. Pick up trucks traditionally hold their value. <br><br>
