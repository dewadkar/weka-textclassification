            Right now you can get .9% financing on the Dodge, Plymouth and Chrysler
new minivans.

I was personally about to buy the Honda minivan, which has received much fan fair.  However the above financing through March is such a great deal
that everyone who is shopping for a van needs to consider.  

After shopping for a van for months I will take advantage of this rare opportunity.  You can buy any of these Chrysler products for invoice or less.  These vans are loaded with features and offer more options than the competition.

To give you another way to compare how much you will save with .9% financing.  If you were thinking about buying a 2 to 3 years old van to lower your overall cost- look again at the numbers.  Unless you are buying the vehicle without financing - the price you would pay from a dealer combined with used car financing of 8% will quickly eat up your savings.  I figure the savings at $2,000 tops and you are getting a 2 to 3 year old vehicle with likely repairs needed 2 to 3 years sooner than a new vehicle.

The interesting thing in all this is the dealers are getting many 2 to 3 year old vehicles back from leases and are trying to sell you on what a great deal they can offer on these vehicles.  The uninformed consumer will buy these vehicles trying to take advantage of the difference between new and used car pricing - but for 3 months &amp; .9% financing take the plunge and buy new.

Note: Get the upgraded low back seats in the SE (sport)
You should compare against the Town and Country LX.
