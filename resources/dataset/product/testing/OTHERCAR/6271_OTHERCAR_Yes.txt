            I am soon to be 19 years old in August, and just a few years ago when I first began to drive, my parents gave me their extremely old, but trusty little car to drive around.  Sooner or later (more sooner, than later though!), that little car called it quits and I was in need for a new one.
Surprisingly, the same day we went looking for a small, affordable yet reliable car, we picked up this cute dark blue '98 Hyundai Accent (used with only 30 miles on it!  Showroom car) for a great price.  I have run that car ragged since, and it's reliable as ever.  The car might not have much power, but it's great on gas and that's very important!  The trunk is extremely roomy (I have a GS), and the car is just the right size for me, it fits in every space possible!  I'm very satisfied and with such a great warranty, who wouldn't be?  Only one slight problem with the car, and it was fixed immediately.  No problems since.  :)  Great for college students!!<br><br>
