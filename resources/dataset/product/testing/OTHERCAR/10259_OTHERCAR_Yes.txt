            In 1988 I purchased my very first Subaru.  Needless to say, I was the brunt of many jokes.  However, this was a turning point in my driving life.  This car had not power steering, which I did not mind at all until I tore the rotator cuff in my shoulder and could no longer drive it. So in 1990, I purchased my second Subaru (now I was hooked).  After it had a fatal mishap with a truck, I purchased my third Subaru.  The Legacy LS.  

What a sweet ride!  The engine purred like a kitten--the transmission shifted effortlessly and the paint was amazingly durable as compared to the other Subarus I had known.

It was comfortable and fun to drive and ride in.  I also loved the moonroof.  What a class act.  I had many joyous days with my friends and family in that car and it took me wherever I needed to go--with barely a hitch.  In the winter, it couldn't be beat.  It started right up, first try and tackled every mountain or swamp that came a long.  The 2.2 liter engine has a lot more power than the other Subaru engines.

I literally drove my car into the ground.  When we purchased the car for $5800.00 US, it had 96,000 miles on it.  When it met it's present demise, it had 221,000 miles on it.  Yes,we got our money's worth.

The car had a few bugs.  Because of the short turning radius (which is quite fun) the CV joints need replaced more often than other small cars.  Also, the front axles have a tendency to wear out quickly.  I believe we repaced both of them 4 times.  At 200,000 miles, the timing belt went--bummer.  But the engine was alright with only a few minor repairs needed. That is all we ever had to do to the car.

This past spring, though, it met with an unhappy radiator disquised as a water pump.  The problem was relentless and nothing we tried seemed to work.  So, after repeated bouts of overheating, the engine just died. We are in the process of replacing the engine and resurrecting the car.

I would highly recommend the 1990 Subaru Legacy to anyone who can find one at a good price.  They just keep going, like the Energizer bunny. <br><br>
