            If you're thinking of buying an Oldsmobile Intrigue - don't be too hesitant. We bought a 2002 in October of 2002 and we are thoroughly pleased with it. I love the room that you have. A big concern my husband had, was having enough leg room if you're a passenger in the back seat. So he had to test it out by moving the driver seat back to where it's comfortable for him to drive and then get in the back to test out his leg room.  He was very surprised to find out he still had enough room to be comfortable.  Another feature that I really like is the extra light when you use the turn signals.  When the lights are on, and you turn on the turn signal, there is an extra light which shines to the side, in the direction which you are turning. It is wonderful - it actually lights up the entire area, so you can see to make the turn. The trunk is very spacious, and is accessible through the inside of the car, by lowering the back seats. The ride is very smooth also.  We test-drove the smaller version, the Alero, in which we felt just about every little bump we hit. But the Intrigue is a very smooth ride. It handles nice and also looks nice.
But one other thing that sold us is the warranty that came with the car - a 5year/50,000 mile warranty. That is excellent!  We average between 21-23MPG driving in town and around 33MPG Highway miles.We decided if we trade it in - we will definitely go for a newer model.  We are definitely sold on the Intrigue.
