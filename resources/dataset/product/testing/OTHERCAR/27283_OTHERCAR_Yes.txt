            Sport-Utility Vehicles are a fixture on our roads.  The combination of off-road ability with people-hauling capacity sells these trucks by the boatload.  If you need to haul more than 5 or 6 people, though, your options are severely limited.  The dreaded minivan is the most obvious ticket, or a station wagon with one of those rear-facing third seats.  The Chevy Suburban can carry up to 9 people, but carries a hefty price tag these days.  If you want a small-ish package, three rows of seats and four wheel drive, the Dodge Durango fits the bill.  We test drove a Durango SLT.

The exterior styling of the Durango is <b>based on the Dakota </b>mid-size pickup truck.  The basic design has been around since the mid 1990's on the Dodge Ram full-size pickup, and wears well over time.  Aggressively bulged fenders and a sculpted hood give a nod to classic trucks of the 1950's, yet look thoroughly modern.  With aluminum wheels and beefy tires, there is no way the <b>Durango looks like </b>anything but <b>a truck.</b>

<b>Inside, </b>the habitat looks good and <b>generally feels luxurious.  </b>The biggest detractor I found was the amount of hard plastic.  The dashboard, door panels, center console and A-pillar were all covered with cheap-sounding hard plastic.  It all seemed durable, but hard plastic will eventually squeak, and may become brittle from sunlight after several years.  

The <b>doors are wide </b>and allow easy access to the front and second rows of seats, although my five-foot-tall wife noted "they design it for a person about one inch taller than I am."  Grab handles are located on the a-pillar and above the back doors for passenger ingress/egress.  The third seat is a bit harder to get into, but the second row seats fold and flip forward very easily, and reveal a step (mostly just a flat spot on the floor) for passengers to climb in back.

The <b>power driver's seat on the SLT </b>model we tested was comfortable, cushy yet not La-Z-Boy-like.  Height and tilt adjustments were available, as was a manual recline.  <b>Adjustable lumbar support </b>was located in just the right spot for my back.  The second seat accommodated my wife and our rear-facing child seat easily.  She reported an abundance of legroom, and was comfortable throughout our half-hour or so test drive.  Shoulder-belts are available for all outboard occupants, but only a lap-belt is in the center position.  

The lack of a center shoulder-belt can be seen as a positive or a negative, depending on your need.  We needed to cinch in our carseat, and the lap-belt-only restraint made it very easy to simply latch the belt, then reef the strap tight -- no need to fuss with a locking clip.

The <b>third row of seats will accomodate two adults </b>-- for short rides.  The seat-bottom is very close to the floor and anyone who is 5'10" or taller (as I am) will find themselves "eating their knees."  The cushioning is thin and the seat is flat.  <b>Children would love sitting there, </b>as it seems to be miles away from Dad the Driver.

Cargo area is puny with all three rows of seats up.  A week's <b>groceries will fit behind the third seat.  </b>The third row folds down in about 10 seconds, though, and provides a flat load floor which would accomodate a week's worth of luggage and/or pet carriers.  With both <b>2nd and 3rd rows folded </b>flat, two or three people <b>could camp in the back </b>of the Durango.

The SLT 4x4 we tested had Dodge's newer <b>4.7 liter V-8 </b>engine, first introduced in the Jeep Grand Cherokee.  It generates <b>235 hp and 295 ft-lbs</b> of torque, and gas mileage is rated at <b>14 city/18 highway.  </b>Rumor has it that this motor actually gets better gas mileage than the 3.9 liter V-6 motor in the Dakota.  The motor is matched to a <b>4-speed automatic </b>transmission with overdrive, and has a real two-speed transfer case that provides <b>2wd, 4wd and 4lo </b>ranges, with shift-on-the-fly capability.  "Up to 55 mph," our salesman stated.

The <b>dashboard is well laid out, </b>with a tachometer on the left and speedometer on the right.  Gauges are the tried-and-true white-on-black analog type, very legible.  Oil pressure, water temperature and voltage gauges are provided standard.  HVAC controls are easy to reach and the rotary dials are easy to use.  The radio is located in about the middle of the dash, and is harder to reach and use while driving, but does provide <b>actual knobs for volume and tuning </b>-- nice to have instead of a salad of pushbuttons.  The model we tested also had a<b> separate rear AC unit.  </b>The combination of front and rear AC cooled the interior of the Durango quickly and effectively on the humid day we drove it.

The Durango<b> handles quite well in town.  </b>Manhole covers and potholes are barely felt through the large tires and long-travel suspension, though the ride is more bouncy than most cars...like a truck, but <b>a well-damped truck.  </b>The SUV was very easy to place in the lane, and visibility was very good through the windows and mirrors...it was easy to check for cars before lane-changes.  The 4.7-liter V-8 provides <b>quick acceleration </b>and crisp response, and returns a throaty exhaust note.

<b>In the curves, </b>the Durango feels very stable and <b>well-planted.  </b>I noticed no front-end push to speak of, and body roll was actually very slight for the type of vehicle this is.  The steering was rather numb and overboosted, though -- I felt that it would be very easy to simply spin the wheel too far and get out of shape in 2wd.  In 4wd, though, the steering felt better, and the "overboost" I'd felt was counteracted by the increased resistance that driven front wheels create.  At all times, though, the Durango felt secure and in-control.

I didn't get to do much more than drive through a gravel park driveway to test the off-road ability.  The <b>suspension soaked up big chuckholes </b><i>very</i> well, though.  I shifted into 4lo, which requires you to stop, put the transmission in neutral, then push the transfer case lever forward, and the difference was instant.  Four-low provided a cruising speed of about 20mph, and pronounced engine-braking.  I tried to spin the wheels on the loose gravel from a standstill in 4lo, and while I snapped the necks of everyone onboard, there wasn't even a hint of wheelspin.

On the freeway, the Durango is likewise very smooth and solid.  Seventy-five miles per hour is an easy speed to reach and hold, and the SUV is very easy to control at that speed.  Given the ability to pay for the gas in an 18mpg vehicle this would be a really good vehicle to take on a long trip.

Which brings us to the price of entry.  We tested a Durango <b>SLT 4x4, </b>which had the 3rd row seat, rear AC, anti-spin rear axle, roof rack, 31" tires with 15" aluminum wheels, floormats and fender flares, and was listed for <b>about $31,300.  </b>You can get the Durango Sport for a bit less, the Durango SLT Plus for a bit more, and the Durango R/T for more than the SLT Plus.  As SUV's in general go, this is in the middle-high price range.  As SUV's with 3 rows of seats go, this is very reasonable, as a Suburban is about your only other choice, and can crest $40 grand very easily.

Overall, I feel that the Durango combines ruggedly original Dodge styling, gutsy V-8 power with V-6 gas mileage, confident handling, smooth ride, easily configurable seating, and capability to carry 8 people...9 with a front bench seat, for about $30,000.  I like this SUV, but there are two things that give me pause.  One is the fuel economy, which is an Achilles Heel for all SUV's by nature.  The other is the "reliability" of Chrysler products.  If your Durango has good karma, I think it will make you very happy, though.

Here's a note, though.  When you ask your wife in the back seat if you should take the test-drive loop that you usually take, and the salesman is along for the ride...don't say "Should we do what we usually do?"  This is virtually guaranteed to scare the bejeezus out of an outnumbered salesman who is in a car with people he's never met before, and there was a leaden pause before "Todd" asked, "Um, that doesn't involve pushing the salesman out and taking off, does it?"

So if you're out there, Todd, I'm really sorry about that.
