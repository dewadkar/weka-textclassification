            I was given my Kodak DC 280 by my husband for Christmas.  I knew he had wanted to buy me a digital camera but I was really afraid that he didn't know what it was he was doing and I would get a dud....Not so!  He bought me the best digital camera that there is out there, the Kodak DC-280. This is the camera that I had dreamed of getting and didn't know he knew was what I wantned.  I had researched,for over six months, all the digital cameras that were out there to be had. I spent countless hours on the internet, read up in magazines, including &quot;Photography&quot;, checked out stores and talked to thier clerks (this was the LEAST helpful by the way!), and talked with friends. All of this research led me to the Kodak DC-280 and thank goodness my husband was paying attention for once! :)  This camera can do just about anything and the photos, when paired up with a photo quality printer, are incredible!

First of all, you have many choices when taking a photo with this camera.  It has the choices of color, black and white, sepia (that antique brown and cream looking photos), framed, unframed, date, no date, high, medium, or low DPI (this will determine how many photos you can save on one memory disk.  At High it is about 25 photos, Medium is about 90 photos, and low you can get about 230 photos!).  The photo can be deleted immediately (if you can tell from the screen on the back of the camera that it is a dud) or deleted after you download it to your computer.  

Also, the hookup to your computer is very simple.  I did it in a minute without even reading the handbook.  Very easy to do.  Downloads take about 1 minute per picture (when using high DPI) and the camera comes with Adobe Deluxe Photo Shop.  Also very easy to use and has tons of neat effects.

All in all I would give this camera five stars ***** for quality, ease of use, and features.  Definately a good camera.<br><br>
