             I bought a 1991 Chevy Cavalier in June 2000 because my Subaru broke down. When I bought it, the oil gage was all the way to the right, but within a week it was all the way to the left. When I took it to the shop the mechanic said the gages are notoriously inaccurate. It has gone up and down but still runs good.
 I have driven it from MO to KY and to WI without any problems at all. But recently problems have arisen. The engine is aluminum for some dumb reason, and I cross threaded one of the spark plugs. A few weeks later it blew out. Luckily I was a few blocks from my house. I had it towed to the shop and an insert was installed. The starter has been going out recently, but I'm too cheap to replace it. It says r-r-r-r-zzzzz. After several tries, the car always starts, so why bother.
 The car seems to fishtail on the highway if it's windy, which makes me scared because I think the car is falling apart. I need to replace the tires but they last forever. Fairly even wear, hardly ever have to rotate them. Pretty good on snow, rain, could be better. Much better winter driving than my Kia.
 No A/C, so it's hotter than you-know-where in the summer. But the heater works good! No oil leaks at all! Seats comfortable but so low, it feels like sitting on the ground. Manual transmission requires expensive transmission fluid, only available at GM dealers. Good power steering. Sometimes turn signal lights pop out of their sockets so you have to duck tape them back in. Gas mileage so-so.<br><br>
