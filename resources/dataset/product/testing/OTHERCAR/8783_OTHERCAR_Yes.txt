            I wanted this last year about now, but, patient as i am, I waited for reviews. They came in quick, and it wasn't good. 
At about 200 dollars for the 16 meg version, the mediocre quality of the camera just wasn't enough to support the addition of an mp3 player and video capture.

Ok, lets be blunt, this player WAS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. It took very grainy, washed out, too dark, too light...its pictures were just plain bad, and only 640 by 480 at that. Heck, I got my intel pocket pc camera a year ago for 40 dollars and it takes far better stills (though its video can't compete, more on that later.) The LCD is useless in the dark, meaning you need a flashlight or BRIGHT light to take stills inside. The mp3 player is a bit better-very basic equalizer, a few shuffle and repeat settings-decent sound but nothing special. The video capture took up to 20 frames per second on high quality, but that took up too much space so most users were stuck with using the unacceptable 10 frame per second mode. And crummy mono sound! And kodak wanted 200 dollars for this? I said "Gimme a break!!"

And they did. Well, its a year later, and now the mc3 is sitting here on my desk. I picked it up at a sale at macy's for 89 dollars, and the price at online stores should reach 100 dollars by spring, if kodak price cuts hold. (If you can't wait it is
$130 at thenerds.net) After the new firmware update, and the price cut, the player doesn't seem so bad anymore....

First of all, lets deal with the 3 roles the player is supposed to have. As a camera, it hasn't much improved. Acceptable for internet use only, not even good enough for decent snapshots if you're picky. Its not useless, and is easy enough to use, but the low quality and problems with the screen are a pain in the neck. I understand that kodak wanted to save battery life, but cameras are supposed to be used in different conditions, aren't they? I guess kodak thinks not.

Now that thats off my chest, let me explain why this little piece IS worth it. First of all, the new firmware allows the little guy to play mp3pros. Not bad at all. Now that memory is cheap (I payed 33 dollars at newegg for 128 megs of refurb compact flash, which worked fine) you can store a ton of mp3pro and regular mp3s, and they actually sound pretty good with decent headphones. 

Anyway, now that I can give support to at least one function of this player (and you can't really get a decent mp3 player alone for less than 100 bucks anyway)I'd better tell you why the high quality mode is worth it. Yes, the sound stinks, but the video...at 320 by 240(roughly VHS)
well, now that you can afford a 128 meg card, you can store about 10 minutes of video, which is, just barely, enough.
And the quality is ok. Pick up the video and audio out cable (bout 15 bucks) for this unit and you'll get decent video. By decent I mean about Super 8 quality. In fact, it looks AMAZINGLY similar to super 8. As an independent film maker that is what convinced me to buy this camera. I have more expensive camcorders and sophisticated computer editing equipment but I still can't get that nifty old super 8 look. So this is it. And it works allright.

So the mc3 has proved itself at this new price. For 200 bucks-no way (it would have been 300 it you wanted to buy a 128 meg card back then!!!) But at the new price it makes the cut. Also, you might want to pick yourself up a carrying case for it, I got one from 800.com for 15 dollars shipped, its worth it to save the screen from scratched and the darn reflective LCD.
