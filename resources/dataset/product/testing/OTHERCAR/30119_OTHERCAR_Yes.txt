            If you want a car that goes down the freeway and over modest hills with the A/C blasting away at it's sole occupant and still gets 40 mpg at 70 mph then the Chevy Metro Lsi/Suzuki Swift (4 cylinder) with the 5 speed manual transmission is the car for you.

If you want a car that car commute in heavy stop and go city traffic and still gets almost 30 mpg then the Chevy Metro Lsi/Suzuki Swift (4 cylinder) with the 3 speed automatic is the car for you.

Don't try to drive the 5 speed in town and don't dare get on the freeway with the automatic. The 5 speed tachs 3000 rpm at 70 mph in 5th gear and the automatic is turning the same at only 51 mph in Drive.

The 5 speed has no acceleration during boulevard races unless you flog the little engine. The feel is like rowing the car around town on the gear box. Torque is so limited from idle that the chance of stalling the engine (with the manual transmission) on a start from anything but level ground is almost certain. But let the little engine slowly accelerate this light car to highway speeds and the 5 speed is great with power to spare for passing above 60 mph.

The automatic is a horse of a different color. Plenty of pep to 50 mph but then the little engine begins to wind so tight that the noise is frightening. The automatic transmission /16 valve, solid lifter engine combination is great for in town commuting (off freeway) and surprisingly for mountain driving on two lane mountain roads up to elevations near 7000'. With two occupants aboard the car is very nimble and will stay with almost any other vehicle in the twisty "high" country.

An inexpensive (less than $8k for a good condition 2001) car to purchase and operate in two very special niches. I know. I own both models ... and yes I have a Chevy pickup for all my "normal" driving.
