            I'm a fairly compulsive guy, so I extensively reviewed 2002 Honda Odyssey before buying it prior to our most recent long vacation trip (June 2002) for our family of five.  After finishing 4000 miles in the Honda van in the last 3 weeks I think I can give you potential Honda vs. Chrysler buyers the info. you may need. I'm no novice to minivans or vans in general.  I've owned and driven several minivans and we've rented 2 Windstars (96 and 02) and 1 Chrylser for partial cross country trips when our vans were indisposed or when we've found it quicker to fly to one part of the US and rent a van for a road trip.  So I've owned or driven Chrysler minivans including 84, 89, 94, 96, 98.
  
After owning 3 Chrysler Minivans, we decided to buy something different and go with the 2002 Honda Odyssey for a change.  This review will focus on Dodge/Chrylser versus Honda Odyssey because I'm no expert on the other vans (although we have had 2 long trips with Windstars as well).

First the good, the 2002 Odyssey is a smooth riding, solid van with (so far) almost nothing but a rock solid feel.  Excellent 5 speed auto transmission and smoother motor than Chrysler with 240 HP.  The folding magic rear seat is what sold my wife on the Honda, she can pack more in this minivan than any we've had.  The interior is surprisingly roomy, partially because of the flat and squared off seat and interior style.  11 cup holders with the minitable between front seats also helps a lot.  Versatile seating arrangement.  Driving at 80 miles per hour or more the van seems more planted than the Daimler Chrylser van, you feel safer at higher speeds in the Honda, although the road feel on the Chrylser is better and the Chrylser feels more like a drivers van.  Fit and finish are excellent on the Honda. Safety features are excellent.  Air condition is excellent, blazing cold with plenty of air. . love that automatic temperature control on the Honda.  Great halogen headlights, clear view at night.  Excellent windshield wipers although placed on confusing stalks with too many things going on on the stalks.

Now the bad.  For my posterior, the Honda seats just don't feel as comfortable as the Chryler's.  Then again, the Chryslers are more form fitting and more comfortable to me, but their design takes up more space than the Honda making the Honda seem roomier on the inside.  The Honda Arm rests aren't positioned right on doors making for no place to put that one elbow. . . tiring on long trips. Steering wheel is a little leftward pointed.  Honda radio/CD/Cassette sounds surprisingly mediocre for a van of this price but the controls on the steering wheel are nice.  Cruise control off/on is on the dash (unusual).  Stickshift is quirky and easy to miss the right gear (although improved for 2002). . . .very unlike the easy to shift Chrylser.  No outdoor temp gauge or compass or trip computer for mileage to empty or gas mileage. . . something standard on most Dodge minivan options.  Chrysler has 3 zone temperature adjustment, Honda doesn't.  Chrysler has electric rear up/down hatch, Honda doesn't.  You miss some of these things once you are used to them.  Also, the Honda electric doors tend to get confused quickly if you change your mind about opening them and push the button again (they freeze), but once you get used to them they are easy and seem fairly dependable.

Also on the Honda, Very limited steering wheel adjustment. . .goes up and down very little.  Steering and road feel more vague than the Chrysler, but suspension is excellent and although you might not feel the road as well it certainly handles every bit as well if not better than the Chrysler at higher speeds.  You just don't feel it through the steering or through the seat of your pants as much as the Chrylser. . . so the Chrylser feels more like a drivers machine to me.  Don't get me wrong, the Honda seems rock stable at 80 or even 90 mph and even seemed like it was going much slower. Passengers couldn't even tell you were going that fast, the suspension and drive train is that good and the 5 speed auto tranny is geared well to keep the rpm's fairly low.  We felt safer at high speeds in the Honda, than we did in the Chrysler.  

The Honda is quiet, very much so, but it does have a tendency to transmit loud expansion joint noise (worse than the Chrysler) but otherwise is very stable and quiet with minimal wind noise.  Can hear occasional gas sloshing from the rear but it is mild and you only hear it when there is no luggage in back, not bothersome.  

One of the disappointments of the Honda was the seating comfort/ergonomics.  From my perspective the ergonomics of the Honda are questionable for someone of my height.  I'm more than a little confused that Honda felt less comfortable than Chrysler or Windstar for the driver.   I'd have to say the Dodge/Chrylser products simply felt more comfortable to sit in and drive. . . at least partially because I'm driven loads of Chrylers. . . but partially because the ergonomics just seem better to me.  Going for a test drive or long drive in the Honda Odyssey?  Try to put your elbow down comfortably on the door elbow rest. . . it's way too low for most of us.  Very little side bolstering in the front seats as well.  The salesman said that the "harder foam" in the Honda seats would in the long run, make us more comfortable on long trips and we would be more rested.  I won't say I was miserable as far as back and bottom, but I sure squirmed a lot more and moved around more than the other minivans we've owned on this last trip.

Leather wrapped steering wheel on Chrysler also feels better than the attractive but hard plastic steering wheel of the Honda.  Honda dash seems like a lot of plastic, not as attractive as Chrysler's dashboard.  Chrysler also gives you more gauges in general.  Honda is minimalistic although what Honda gives you is easy to read at a glance (large speedometer).  Honda does not give you an amp gauge or oil pressure gauge. . just an idiot light if something goes wrong.  Finally, the Chrylser products look better, unless you have some love affair with the Honda name and worship the "H" logo like some people seem to do.  In my opinion the Honda looks kind of squared and stodgy and is probably overvalued.  But the paint, fit and finish and aluminum wheels are all top notch.  

VALUE AND RESALE:  When something is new and hot and rare, it's value is higher.  When people like a certain car company or have a brand loyalty, that product is valued more.  Honda Odyssey is currently hot, but that should change because the factories are now ramping up to produce more.  My 2nd Chrysler Minivan was hot when I sold it in 1994, for more than I paid for it!  Now Chrysler minivans are not as hot and Dodge/Chrysler minivan resale is not as great.  Not as good as the Honda and the Honda is the resale queen at the moment.  So if you are going to resell your van in a year or two, Honda would probably be the one to go with . . at least for the moment.  And if you have a van to trade in on a Honda. . . think twice.  You might do a lot better selling it yourself.  Honda doesn't deal much at all on the price of your trade-in, they don't have to because their van is in demand.

FINAL COMMENTS:  I want to be fair, but after 4 weeks I miss my old Dodge Grand Caravan LE.  We had almost zero problems in the 94,000 miles we had our last Dodge minivan. I wish we could blend the best qualities of both of these vans into one super great van.  I love the engine/drive train/suspension/rock solid feel of quality of the Honda.  Honda has great brakes, really a great piece of work.  But I preferred the ergonomics/infinity radio/gadgets of the Chryslers.  I may have to change the Honda speakers (awful sound) and have already added an aftermarket compass/temp mirror to the Honda which helps a little.  The Honda minivan stops and goes great, is like a very dependable appliance with a marvelous rear fold down seat that actually made our recent vacation most enjoyable because it packed more STUFF than the latest Chrysler's are capable of behind the seat.  (Hey, it's hard to get comfortable on a vacation drive if your van is overstuffed)  That is the key reason we bought the Honda.  Chrysler seats (even the 2002 ones) are inconvenient to remove, the old ones were back breakers to remove, and there is simply not enough storage room behind the seat.  But the Chrysler was more comfortable for the driver, their vans look better (my opinion) and the Chrysler's ergonomics were better for this 5'11" guy.  And the Chrysler had more gee-whiz gadgets on the sharp looking dash.  And the Chrysler stick shift and steering wheel and controls were placed in perfect locations.  For the Honda, the positions are a little quirky and some things are a stretch.  Case in point. . . no cigarette lighter in the Honda. . you've got to plug your phone in to an inconveniently located outlet on the floor which does NOT charge or stay on when you remove the car key.  When you are a darling of the motoring press or public like Honda Odyssey is at the moment, your faults get overlooked for a while.  Right now, Daimler-Chrylser is the has-been, former reigning minivan queen and she is getting a little overly criticized and the upstart new minivan queen (Honda) is probably a little overly praised at the moment.  It's interesting to note that the public and motoring press seem to overlook the little faults of the Honda, so I'm trying to tell you about them so you can know for an imformed buying decision.  

So if you need the extra storage behind the seat with the magic fold down ability, and a great quick resale value down the road, you can't do better than going with the  Honda Odyssey.  But if you don't need the extra storage and if you value gee whiz gadgets, great looks and good ergonomics over rear compartment storage, then seriously consider the Chrysler products.  The Chrysler folks were willing to seriously deal with us, Honda made us pay list price and gave us very little trade in on our Minivan.
