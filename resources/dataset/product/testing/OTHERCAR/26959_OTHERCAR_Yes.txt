            My, my but I've had a few vehicles since I started driving back in 1985. In counting them up, I've discovered that I've had nine of those things in 15 years, and that seems like quite a few. Of course, three of those were the &quot;primary&quot; car of either my Wife or ex-wife, but still.

One of the most reliable of the lot, though, was the 1991 Mitsubishi Galant. I picked that little gem up for around $5,000 in 1995, and was very pleased with it. Before I get too far in my description of the vehicle, I should mention that I ran across some &quot;old timers&quot; who really hate these things. Mitsubishi, after all, was famous in World War II for making airplanes and tanks that shot at Americans.

The good news, of course, is that the company seems to make reliable vehicles and, fortunately, they are even more appealing as they're not used to shoot at soldiers. Still, though, you'll get some folks who hate these vehicles because of the history of the company.

I've never been what you might call &quot;easy&quot; on cars (i.e. I drive the hell out of them), and the Mitsubishi held up very well. I tend to drive cars often, and absolutely hate being &quot;down&quot; when a car is in the shop. The Galant proved to be a touch little critter, and it game me everything I needed -- when I cranked the ignition, I knew the engine would come to life and I could get about my business of tooling around town or hitting the freeway with no concerns about being stranded.

My only real complaint about the vehicle is that it lacked power. It came with a 2.4L 4cyl under the hood that moved the car down the road just fine, but it hauled the car up to speed rather slowly. My car came with an automatic transmission, and I suspect that a five-speed, manual transmission would improve the performance of the car, but I'm not sure. That is, however, usually the case when it comes to four-bangers, so I don't know why the Galant would be any different.

With that said, the engine and transmission held up well, as did the rest of the car's powertrain. I had the four-door LS sedan, and the car provided a moderately-comfortable ride with a little bit of wind noise on the open road. It, being a smallish car, took bumps and potholes like one would expect, but I had no complaints about the ride. There was plenty of room in the front seats, but the ride was a little bit cramped in the back. Once again, this is typical for small cars. Trunk space wasn't exactly generous, but it wasn't bad, either -- loading up that trunk with Christmas presents, luggage and other items for long trips wasn't too much of a chore.

The interior was cloth, and I had power windows and locks. Although I've known power windows and locks to be problematic on cars (I had a Subaru that was horrible in that regard), the Mitsubishi's power appointments game me no trouble. Handling, too, was tight and reliable -- minimal body roll was the rule during hard cornering.

So, if you can find one of these cars in good shape, grab it if you want a reliable vehicle. You won't set any land speed records in it, but it will get you to where you want to go well enough.
