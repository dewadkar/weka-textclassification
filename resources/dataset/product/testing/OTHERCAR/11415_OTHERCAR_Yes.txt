            <b>Why a 4Runner?</b>
Why not? I can hardly see a reason.  They have been consistently rated among the highest SUV's on the market in terms of dependability.  The resale value for these SUVs are second to none as they retain their value better than any other.  Plus my wife and I just got a dog and we hated hauling that kennel around in the Corolla all the time.

<b>Exterior</b>
Man do I love the way my 2000 Toyota 4Runner Limited (Silver) looks.  It has the large wheels (16&quot;) and the flares over them that give this sleek SUV a tough look to it.  The curves of the body and the size of the tires really combine to make this a nice lookin' ride.

<b>Interior</b>
The seats (leather) are comfortable with 6 way adjustments but lumbar support is only available for the driver.  The steering wheel doesn't telescope.

If there is one disappointment it would be the controls and dash of the 4Runner.  It is adequate enough.  Has some nice wood grain and a good sound system, but it lacks a lot of the extras you would expect in a &quot;Limited Edition&quot; with pretty much all the available options.  I would expect a vehicle of this type (and cost) to have a compass, better temp controls, and simple more little doohickeys and gizmos.

<b>Handling</b>
Smooth and relatively quite.  Doesn't drive like a truck.  Can corner tighter than you would think with a vehicle this size.<br><br>
