            We too started looking at Honda's for the disappearing third seat.  When this van came out we were hooked.  It's much sportier than the Honda, especially with the sunroof and ground effects package.  I love that the captain's chairs slide together to form a bench seat and that the windows go down by the second row of seats.  This really helps with the air flow through the van.

Great van, just the right size for today's &quot;average&quot; family.  I wouldn't recommend this van if you have more than 3 children as going away on trips would be next to impossible.  We traveled 4 hours over Christmas with 3 kids and 2 adults and were fine, but couldn't have squeezed another package or person into the van.  What saved us was being able to remove one of the second row seats, it gave us just the extra space we needed for packages.

The ride's a little noisy with the sunroof open.  I think buying an inexpensive deflector will help with that immensely.  The sunroof is HUGE, it's well worth the extra money.  There are plenty of drink holders in this van as well.  Definitely a great family car!<br><br>
