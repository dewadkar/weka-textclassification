            We purchased our minivan in August of 99 and we were VERY excited!  This was our first van and we were so excited to be graduating to a &quot;real&quot; family vehicle. The Dodge Caravan was not my first choice, but at the time we could not afford a brand new 99 Toyota Sienna (I love Toyotas) Before I continue, I must say, that we did buy a used 96 van.  So I never expected it to be perfect, just perform well...and that it does.  I have never had a problem with the performance of the vehicle.  

BUT approx. 1 month after we bought it, the power door lock on the rear passenger side went out.  This would be OK if it could be manually locked, but NO, it's forever stuck UNLOCKED until we can shell out $350 to get our local Dodge dealer to fix it.  I am a HUGE scaredy cat when it comes to thinking the latest rapist/murderer/mugger/child abductor is hiding in my car.  And this does not help the situation any.  

Secondly, approx 2 months after having bought this &quot;well developed&quot; minivan, the brake light starts flashing on and off at different times during your commute.  Scary at first because I'm thinking the emergency brake has engaged itself, but nonetheless, it's nothing serious.  $250 can clear it right up!

Thirdly, the gas door popped off.  Granted this is not a problem, just a minor annoyance.  But it does make the van look dorky.  So once again I am on the phone with my &quot;friendly&quot; Dodge dealer...for the door $55.00...for the labor...approx$300.00.  UMMMM, did I miss something!  I either missed the line to get in for getting a money tree, or I need to get myself a dealership!

I really do think that the van is wonderful in every other way, I love the way it look(minus the gas door) I love the way it handles, I love having the drivers side door...  I just bugs me that every time I get a new used vehicle, there is always something wrong with it AFTER I purchase it.  I guess this is the American way, and I should learn to deal with it.  And Dodge is no different.  I just wish I had the money to fix these minor problems (of course if I did, I would have gotten what I wanted in the first place, the Sienna)<br><br>
