            Subject: Sony DESC-S30 
Options: 16 mb memory stick, InfoLi M battery, Polarized lens 
Length of Ownership: 2 years 

STRENGTHS:
Innovative tilting LCD &#150 I find this feature most useful when taking pictures of oneself, Easy-to-use and robust Sony menu &#150 Multiple picture delete function is great, 
Durable &#150 I dropped this from waist level down on a boat deck at freezing temperature and the camera still works; I have taken 4,700 pictures with mine and it still works great,
Lens attachments &#150 This is one of the few digital cameras that allows lens attachments and I have added a fish eye, wide angle and polarizer to mine, 
TV out &#150 this feature permits one to view pictures directly from the camera on a tv screen 

WEAKNESSES:
Lack of optical viewfinder &#150 This makes night time/ low-light picture taking impossible,
Poor low-light image quality &#150 The pictures are extremely grainy, 
Expensive memory stick &#150 Sony memory sticks are more expensive than competing memory technologies, 
Expensive InfoLithium batteries &#150 My original battery died after 4,000  pictures and I paid $60 for a replacement.
USB &#150 I don&#146t know if my unit is getting too old or what but I noticed when I fill the 16 mb stick to capacity and then use the USB to transfer images to my Win98 PC it would hang.  I don&#146t recall having this problem when the unit was newer.

Bottom Line:
This is not an inexpensive unit.  However, you won&#146t find too many units that offer lens attachments and a rotating LCD.  I have taken 4,000  pictures with mine and journeyed to foreign lands and I am completely satisfied with it.  If you can afford additional memory sticks, you should save images at 1,472 x 1,104 resolution; in doing so, you&#146ll obtain some very high quality images.
