               Hi! I bought my 1999 SC1 in August of 1998 at Saturn of Mesquite. It has now passed 20,000 miles on the odometer. I bought this car because I need a new car and this was only $14,000. I got a 5 speed manual that shifts really well, has an easy throw and a nice clutch. This car drives  well for the money. I have not been hard on the car though, I live in Dallas and I've only driven it to Austin twice. I'm a college student. I get the regular scheduled maintenance on time. I'm over 25, so the insurance for this car costs me $80.00 a month. The lease payment is $220.00 so to drive this car for 3 years takes $300.00 a month. Gas mileage is great with this 5 speed.
   
The best deal on the lot was black, big mistake in Dallas! It is so hot in summer, that things melt in this car that you wouldn't expect even though I leave the windows open a few inches. But that's my fault for choosing a black car in Texas.
   
So why am I disappointed? The seat back of the driver's seat broke a year ago. And the dome light malfunctions. This means at night I can't find anything in the car, and I can't move the seat back forward or back to get anything off the back seat. I can't afford to pay to have these things fixed, it takes all I have to pay the monthly obligations and keep the scheduled maintenance current. <br><br>
