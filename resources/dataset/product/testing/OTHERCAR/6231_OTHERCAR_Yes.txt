            I recently bought the Nissan Frontier Crew Cab XE V6 4x4.  I chose this vehicle because I have a young infant and can only afford one vehicle for the family.  Besides giving me a good size back seat for my son and the occasional passenger, it is very practical.  I don't haul things very often, but I love to fish.  The bed offers a place to carry items without trashing the interior.  I also plan to buy a boat in about a year or so and the towing capacity of the vehicle is outstanding.  I like this truck because it is so practical and versatile.  
The few things I don't like is I bought the bed X-Tender, which cost me about $300.  Although I believe this is a very clever device, I think it should be standard equipment or at least with a more modest price tag.  I also don't like the two speed fixed windshield wipers.  The intermittent wipers are only standard on the SE models.  I believe such a simple item should be standard on a vehicle with so many other options (map lights, 4x4, v6, AM/FM Cass with 3CD in dash changer, AC, Automatic, etc.).<br><br>
