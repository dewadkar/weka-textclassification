            I bought this car for company use in November of '98.  I have since put 70,000 miles on it.  The only thing I've had to do was replace the tires.  I would definitely buy another.  I drive this car approximately 100 miles a day.  I do not mind the long hours on the seats.  The trunk is extremely roomy and fits my family of three's luggage more than adequately.  I am 6'5&quot; tall and have no problems associated with head or leg room.  With the standard V6 I average close to 25 mpg.  I have changed the oil every 3500 miles and have yet to take it to a shop.  Many people comment on the good looks of the car.<br><br>
