            Wow!  What a great car!  I bought this after driving through a car lot, just to see what they had, and saw this beautiful purple compact 4 door with a emblem I didn't recognize, just begging me to come take a look.  It was enough to get me out of the car in the rain to peek inside.  The salesman came out and told me it was a Hyundai Accent.  I balked, as my first car, a 1986 Hyundai Excel, had been a death trap, first blowing the rods 3 weeks after purchase then the second engine catching on fire and the third breaking down in a blizzard in Wyoming.  He convinced me Hyundai had changed it's ways and talked me into a test drive.  I took it out, on side streets, down the bypass, slammed the brakes at 55 mph, let go of the steering wheel to see how straight it was and even going down an alley to see how smooth it rode.  Beautiful.  I had my husband test drive it and he came back and we agreed to go home and research it online.  After about 2 hours of him on his computer and I on mine we decided to make our offer, as it had measured up.  
We bought it and that weekend I took it on a trip to Idaho.  The ride was smoother than I had had in any other compact car and never once was I uncomfortable.  
All the buttons and levers were in the right locations and large enough so I didn't have to hunt for them.  
I take it on minimum 200 mile trips every other weekend, plus I drive 30 miles to and from work 5 days a week in extreme stop and go traffic on our highway.  It has never failed to stop on a dime, handles beautifully on ice and snow.  It doesn't rattle like other small cars, but is quiet except for the ever windy sound you get in ALL cars (including our Audi A6 Quattro luxury car!!!) while going at high speeds.  I get between 35 city miles and 48 highway with it still.  
It handles full loads well and I have a daughter with a car seat and it has plenty of room to get her in and out comfortably.  It does have 3 tether anchor locations too!!!
