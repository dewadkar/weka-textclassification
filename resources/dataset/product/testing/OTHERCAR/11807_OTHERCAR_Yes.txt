            Well I bought a new 98 Nissan Frontier right as the 99's where coming out to save money.  After looking at all brands and discovering That I wouldn't beable to get a V-6 due to all the V-6 makes equiped how I'd want where already sold, I had to swallow my pride and get a 4 banger. Well Knowing that quickly eliminated all american brands since they have the annorexic 120hp and the Toyota and Nissan where both in the 140's so I quickly went to the toyota lot since I knew about there great quality. Well the Toyota Lot in Midland Texas wasn't in the mood to negotiate at all. they wanted sticker and well I don't believe in paying sticker for a "mini truck" so I decided to check out the Nissan Frontier. It was newly redesigned and it seemed to be virtually the same thing as a toyota but about 3-5k less and so I was driving my new Nissan, It got really good gas milage compared to my 81 F-100 (not a F-150, same size less truck) and it was just as peppy. Around town the thing has plenty of power but if you do any highway driving keep looking.  You can't pass people if they decide that they where going 2 slow and they start to speed up. and well back behind slow poke, then try to pass and well the senario repeats it-self and the vulgarity's in my truck cab increased. the air conditioner went out but warantee fixed it. I had good customer service in Midland but poor in Lubbock they tried to charge me for everything in Lubbock nothing was covered under the so called bumper to bumper warantee, like battery and the seat got stuck they wouldn't fix it, I had to myself. I also found out how cheap the nissan truck is put together..if you can avoid it don't let another vehicle collide with the front end of these trucks weither you rearend someone or someone hits you in a parking lot. I rearended a lady under 2 miles per hour repair cost $2,500 for mine and well her subaru legacy had a minor scratch on the bumper. the whole front end was hanging...definely not like my old Ford, I once rammed a friends truck trying to get him unstuck couldn't get ro front to tow and so we decided RAMMING SPEED CAPTAIN! it worked..anyway Nissan Frontier did everything I needed it to just wasn't what I wanted so I decided that I'd trade it. And then I discovered how all the dealers tried to stiff me on the trade, finally found one that would work with me and so I I commence on to my 1/4 life crisis and got a Mustang GT but thats another review. if I'd redue it I'd get a Toyota.
