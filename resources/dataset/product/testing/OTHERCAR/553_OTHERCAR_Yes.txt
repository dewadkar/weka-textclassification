            I purchased this car on March 31, 2000 to replace an 85 Audi 5000 that finally gave up on me after 7 years... I have 4700 miles on it already...  I purchased the bare-bones model... We're talking "minimum features"... It's a 2-door, Black, with a 5-speed... (No A/C, no cruise)

Pros:
* Great on gas...
* Surprisingly comfortable on long trips for a small car...
* Acceleration is decent... (I would NEVER buy this car with an automatic, the engine is just too small)...
* Handling is adequate...
* Purchase was inexpensive...
* Headlights are adequate, high-beams light up a mile down the road...
Added 5/22/2000 (@6200 miles): Body style is more appealing than previous years...
Added 5/22/2000 (@6200 miles): Book says that the car is supposed to get 36 mpg... Past couple of a weeks I have gotten 40-42 mpg depending on the gas I buy...
Added 5/18/01 (@54000 miles): The dealership has made this car an absolute pleasure to drive with the way they support the warranty.

Cons:
* Suspension could be stiffer (bounces too much over bumps/too much body roll)...
* It's really tiny... I wouldn't want to get in even a fender bender in this thing...
* The radiator needs more protection from rocks, etc...
Added 5/22/2000 (@6200 miles): Mirror views are not adequate... I will be purchasing accessories to get full view to the rear...
Added 5/18/01 (@54000 miles): Alternator replaced 6 months ago.
Added 5/18/01 (@54000 miles): Catalytic Converter replaced because of failed emissions (it seems that this is a common problem with the Accents).

I wouldn't consider selling this car... There is no way to get any kind of resale on it... My insurance company extended the 60K bumper to bumper to 100K... So I at least have the car until then, and I am pretty competent with most auto repairs... so I've basically decided to run this car into the ground, I am guessing that by the time this car actually quits, I will be able to afford my next Audi... I would recommend this car to anyone who wants to buy new, without having to pay new car prices, can swallow their pride because they drive a Hyundai, and don't need the best... 

Added 5/22/2000 (@6200): I decided that now that the break-in period is basically over, I will be replacing the oil that is currently in there to Amsoil Synthetic oil...  25000 miles on the same oil... it is worth the extra expense up front, but cheaper over time...
Opinion after 6200 miles... Still liking the car and the money that I am saving...
Added 6/23/2000 (@10500): Just had the rotors replaced.  Not sure if they lug nuts are being torqued down properly.  No big deal... Service at the Danbury, CT dealership is excellent... Dropped synthetic motor oil in the car. Seems to have more power, engine is quieter.

Added 7/17/01 (@60600 miles):  Great car to date.  Note: Dealership does not warranty problems that are noticed over 65 mph.  Car shakes a little at 85 mph, probably a bearing loose or unbalanced tire.  To date, car still plugs along like the first day I drove it... I'm very happy I didn't purchase an automatic.

Added 9/27/01 (@66000 miles):  Discovered an interesting website:  http://www.hyundaiperformance.com/
I am investigating a suspension upgrade at this time.
