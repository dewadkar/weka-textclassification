            The 1997 Pontiac Grand Am is a must have car of you like driving in excitement. My brother owns this car and I have had the opportunity to drive it and use it several times, even for long trips, and on a day to day basis. What an excellent car the Pontiac Grand Am is, it has many options to fit your needs.   I recently drove this car to Phoenix on vacation and what a great smooth ride it was, and I couldn't believe the gas mileage! Of call the cars I have owned and have drove periodically the Pontiac Grand Am fits my life style the most. It's an economic car and cheap to purchase. It has many options that can fit your needs, regardless what it may be, if your planning to purchase a car for long trips or day to day city driving this car has your name on it.   The car features cruise control, air conditioning, power steering, power windows, power locks, leather seats (depending on model). You can have your options custom to fit your needs, and they are very reliable. Aside from this, the only problem that has gone wrong was the water pump went out. After we purchased this vehicle it still had a warranty from the manufacturer, we were able to take the vehicle back and they did a fantastic job repairing it and it did not cost a dime.   Overall a fantastic car, I personally recommend this car to anyone, it's economic, cheap, and reliable, what else would you ask for in a car? I encourage you to look into this car if your considering buying a newer used car. Let me know what you think.  <br><br>
