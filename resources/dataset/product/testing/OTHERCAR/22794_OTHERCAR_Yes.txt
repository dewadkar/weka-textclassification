            I bought my 1999 Hyundai Accent 2dr. with A/C. This is pretty good car for the price I paid for it. Caught it on sale, brand new for $6999. When the deal was struck, total price was approx. $9695 + Financing at 7.9% totaling about $11,008! You can't find that price anywhere. I would recommend this car for a first time buyer. Only two complaints I have with this car. A ping squealing sound on take off in which I found out is a defect with the resonator, no big deal and the stick is rubbery. I still miss at times 5th gear and hit 3rd and had that problem with hitting 3rd. After a little time I am able to hit third without any problem. But, with 5th gear, that still is a problem. But, all in all, you can't beat the warranty and Hyundai is improving their cars to compete against the other big car makers. A little more to go, but a vast improvement from their past cars.<br><br>
