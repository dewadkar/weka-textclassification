            I have had several versions of the Kodak digital cameras and was always pretty pleased, but this little Fuji made me fall in love.  It is small enough to slip into your pocketbook, and takes excellent pictures. The quality is superb! I also love the design. It is a sharp looking, sexy little camera.

A few things to watch out for. The camera does not have a USB cable, so I had to buy a filmreader for faster loading to my PC. It takes a little practice to get the hang of picture taking. The menus can be a little confusing.

All in all, this is a great camera, especially if you want to make sure you have a camera handy. Just throw it in your bag, and you won't even know it's there until you need it. <br><br>
