            I had no desire to buy a Suzuki.  I don�t like Suzukis as a rule.  They�re tiny, cheap and nothing I would ever consider.

Stating that, Suzuki Motor Company sent me a letter, stating that if I would test-drive a V-6 Grand Vitara before September 30, 2000, they would give me $50.00.  Not being someone to give up free money for a few minutes of spare time, I complied with the request and ran over to my local Suzuki dealer, Phil Long Suzuki.

My initial thought was to just say to the dealer, �Hey.  Here�s a $50.00 certificate.  I�m not buying a car, and I don�t want to waste your time, so just sign this and we�ll both be happy.�  Then I thought that I would miss a perfect opportunity to test-drive a car and submit an opinion at Epinions.  I went ahead and skipped idea one.

My first impression of the Grand Vitara was that it was similar in size to a Toyota RAV4, which is a disgustingly small vehicle and a sad excuse for an SUV.  When I looked inside the vehicle, I had the same impression.  It was basically a compact car set up on a frame and raised up in the air.

However, when I sat in the front seat, I was happy to see that it went all the way back to accommodate my six-foot tall body, and that I wasn�t anything close to cramped inside.  We even folded down the rear seats, which in many vehicles would take a few inches away from the front seats sliding back.  No, that wasn�t the case here � these front seats still went all the way back.  The front seats provide a full 41.4 inches of legroom.  I found the seats to be surprisingly comfortable despite their small size.

The next thing I noticed was the fantastic line of sight for the driver � both out of the windshield and side windows, and surprisingly enough out of the rear window.  I was sure that the full-sized spare on the back door would interfere with my vision, but I was pleasantly incorrect.

The rear seats were a bit more cramped, providing only 35.9 inches of legroom.  I would not feel as if I would be comfortable riding for long periods of time, especially if there were yet another adult in the rear.  If I sat sideways I could extend my legs and have the room I needed, but then the seat belt would be uncomfortable.

The luggage area was almost non-existent.  You have a few cubic feet worth of space to contend with, possibly wide enough to accommodate a small golf bag or a few groceries.  You aren�t going to be hauling away even a small television in the cargo area.

That is, of course, unless you fold down the rear seats.  However, this means you can only accommodate two passengers instead of four.  When you do fold down the rear seats, you now have a much larger amount (44.7 cubic feet) of cargo space suitable for carrying larger objects.

The vehicle I drove was a manual 5-speed transmission.  The gearbox shifted flawlessly, never feeling as if it were cheap or loose.  I appreciate that feature in a manual, especially thinking back to my little Mazda that was looser than a $5 hooker on a Saturday night.

The four-wheel drive gearbox also ran flawlessly.  I could drive down the street at nearly any speed I chose and switch from 2-High to 4-High.  The salesperson informed me that to shift to 4-Low it was wisest to stop.  This is the same as the Toyota 4Runner my father owns, so I was used to that.

This model, the JLX+, came with a 4.5-liter V6, 24-valve Quad Cam engine, producing 155 horsepower at 6500 RPM.  It has 160 torque feet-pounds at 4,000 RPM.  It also had four-wheel ABS and second-generation dual airbags, which are supposed to deploy slower and help prevent injuries during deployment.  It has 16-inch aluminum wheels and a full-sized spare (no donut spare!).

It has a 97.6-inch wheelbase and was extremely easy to maneuver around corners and into parking spaces.  It provides 7.5 inches of ground clearance in two-wheel drive and eight inches of clearance in four-wheel drive.   The fuel tank holds 16.9 gallons of unleaded gasoline and will run off 85-octane (which is the same as 87-octane in lower altitudes).  The vehicle gets 19mpg in the city and 21mpg on the highway.

Inside, this vehicle had power everything except seats.  It also had an AM/FM/Cassette stereo with a 6-disc CD-changer under the passenger seat.

I found the ride to be surprisingly quiet.  There were no squeaks and certainly no road noise � which in my experience is highly unusual for an SUV.  This vehicle is built on a frame and is not a unitized body, which probably leads to far fewer squeaks.

There are two downsides to the Grand Vitara.  Suzuki neither makes a towing package nor a front bumper guard kit for the vehicle.  The dealer indicated that neither was available aftermarket for the dealer.   He did tell me that it was possible to hook a towing kit to the vehicle using an aftermarket kit, but would recommend against it because the engine cooling system wasn�t set up for towing.  That may be reason enough to avoid this SUV.

The Grand Vitara comes with a 36-month/36,000 mile warranty standard, and extended warranties are available.  If for some reason the vehicle breaks down during the warranty period, Suzuki (not the dealership) promises to provide a loaner vehicle from Enterprise Rent-A-Car.  That statement is made in writing in the car�s Warranty Information Booklet.

The vehicle I test drove had a sticker price of just under $21,000.  It was a basic white, called �Bright White� by Suzuki.  There are thirteen colors available depending on which model you purchase.

Overall, I must admit that I was impressed with the Grand Vitara JLX+.  That isn�t to say that I would ever purchase one, because the vehicle as a whole is simply too small for my liking.  I still prefer the look, style and feel of a Toyota 4Runner, but they run almost twice the price of the Grand Vitara.  I would also be using a towing hitch on a regular basis, and thus the Grand Vitara�s weak cooling system would preclude that option.

However, if you want an SUV and you�re on a tighter budget, you may want to give the Grand Vitara serious consideration
