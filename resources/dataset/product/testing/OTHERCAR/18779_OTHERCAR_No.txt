            Ahh.. now we come to the KIA sephia.  Possibly the slowest most underpowered car in its class.  Sure they cracked the 10k barrier for a new car.  But what are you really putting your 10k on.  This car has your basic golf kart acsessories. A radio. Doorlocks. Clock.  Thats pretty much it.  If you dont want to deal with the very bland interior and over all pitiful performance on street.  I strongly recommend you do not get this car.  However if you are looking for just a daily driver and or family sedan and power/luxury is not an issue for you.  Be my guest.  Now dont get me started on the looks of the underpowered &quot;cheap rider&quot;.  It has your basic style from the early 90's VERY plain, very un-sporty like.  I do not recommend this car at all.  Oh sure its 10k.. WOW, but you mine as well buy a used car with a little more features.<br><br>
