            My husband and I bought my 1998 blazer a year ago, used. It only had 20,000 miles on it at the time. I went from a Camry to the Blazer and was a little worried about how it would handle and drive. I learned VERY quickly that as long as I didnt take curves at  90 miles an hour, it was fine &lt;grin&gt;. I never imagined a vechicle could have so much room, and not fill like you were driving a tank.
I love how high the truck sits, so I do not fill like I am on the ground while on the road. The room for passengers and cargo is great. In fact I dont think we would be able to take a trip now, without the truck. It will come in even more handy once we have kids.
The only problems I have had with the truck, is springs needed to be replaced twice (something to do with the tires/shocks) however it was covered by warranty. The gas milage isnt great, but better that I expected. The ride is smooth and quite. 
The vehicle is great from family highway use, AND backroad use. Just wish it wasnt quite as expensive.<br><br>
