                   This car is really good.  It has so much more than what you would expect for fifteen thousand dollars.  It has the honda quality engine which has become a must for all cars nowadays.It runs great and I would recommend a manual because it gives you more control in the ice and you don't have to brake as much, but for the lazy people there is always the good old automatic.  
     The seats are very comfortable and it is a pleasure to be in them for long periods of time.  I think that the amazing thing is how can you expect a car so small to have such a big trunk.  It boggles the mind, it huge(for a car so small).  It really is a turn on if you are looking to buy this car.  I would recommend a dark color like black because it isn't that flashy, but who cares, right?
     Overall this car is a great buy for your buck.  The price grabs your eyes and the quality pulls you in.  This is a fine car and I would recommend that you take a look at it as soon as you can.<br><br>
