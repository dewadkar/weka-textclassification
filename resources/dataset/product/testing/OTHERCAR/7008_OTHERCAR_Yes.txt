            The Land Cruiser has always been a particular eye-pleaser and fave ofmine in the wide world of sport utilities.  It has been the most dependable and  reliable vehicleof choice for safari-goers,businessmen, spoiled private school kids(not to worry, my schoolis private),and soccer moms alike.  It's the toughest all-terrain vehicle created, and it's on-road performance and luxury excel most standards.  The Cruiser is reasonably sized, with far better handling than the Suburban and Excursion tanks that terrorize roads everywhere.  At the same time, it's roomy enough to accomodate plenty of passengers and cargo. I like the optional third row seats,which appeal to mini-van lovers.  However, combine interior luxury with bullet-proof performance,andyou've got one helluva set of wheels.<br><br>
