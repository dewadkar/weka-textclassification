            I spent an interesting two or so years with a 98 Plymouth Neon.  I learned that Neon has quite a split personality that made ownership a joy one minute and a nuisance the next.
I had almost dismissed buying the Neon before driving due to it's feminine looks, but one test drive changed my mind.  The Neon's 2.0L in-line four (when coupled with a 5 speed) was surprisingly powerful.  The 4 wheel independent suspension, standard Goodyear Eagle GA's and cab forward stance contributed to amazingly good handling.  
The interior was attractive and quite roomy also due to cab forward design.  The seats were fairly comfortable, even in the back and I was blown away by the standard 6 speaker infinity built stereo.  The ergonomics of the car were great with well placed cup holders and easy to use climate control knobs.  The car was made even more appealing by it's low price.  Initially I was won by Neon because the performance and price both were better than any competitor.  In fact I even began to defend it's girlish figure.
But then the Neon's personality began to change.  The first problem I had were with the car's windows.  The driver and passenger windows were made to seal directly against the body of the car (there was no frame on the door itself for the window to fit against).  Because of this, the windows became loose inside the door and would sound like they were going to fall out if you didn't shut the door with the window all the way up (a problem that could not be fixed and affects all Neon made before 1999). 
I also had several build quality problems.  I had to have the manual transmission replaced at 15k because a faulty second gear.  I had the tail light seals and trunk carpet replaced around the same time due to water leaking into the trunk.  Around 25k I had to replace a faulty computer chip.  At 27k I had to have all the interior trim rubber re-glued because it was falling out. At 29,30 and 31k I had to have the door hinges worked on do to a loud popping noise every time the door was opened.  The most disturbing problem I had with this car was the steering wheel locking in a turn after splashing through a puddle (this happened several times).
With all these problems my Neon lost a ton of credibility.  I finally had to get rid of it for fear that I would go broke fixing it after the warranty ran out.
I am glad that I can share this experience with others so they may hopefully avoid the Neon.  Also please be aware that the new Neon may look different, but underneath the body it is identical to the car that I struggled with for almost three years
