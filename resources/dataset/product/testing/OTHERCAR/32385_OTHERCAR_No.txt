            I bought this vehicle because I wanted something more better and luxurious than an Expedition -- I needed an upgrade.  I love how it drives, so smooth and easy to navigate, it does not feel like your driving an SUV, it feels like your flying an airplane.  Somebody who have a good paycheck coming in weekly and knows how to handle finances and wants a luxury SUV for the road and off, then this was built for you!  If you're struggling to make payments for your current brand name car, this isn't for you.  The price is very high, so know what you're getting in to, but a price for this vehicle does not matter to me, because it's simply the best SUV I've ever driven!!!<br><br>
