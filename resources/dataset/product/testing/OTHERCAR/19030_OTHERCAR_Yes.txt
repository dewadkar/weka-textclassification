            I bought my Olympus C2020 Zoom digital camera in late January, 2000 for about $900. After adding a strap to prevent lens cap loss (I've lost 2 so far even with the strap), a battery charger, and an extra memory card, my total cost was over $1050.  Lots of features--I'm still learning to use them all!  It's great to not worry about wasting a lot of film. I just erase "bad" pictures & shoot away. Am getting pretty good results (see http:community.webshots.com/user/melhouse1 for examples), even using the camera's programmed settings.  Good, sharp detail in macro mode as well. The camera's small size makes it convenient to take along, but it has some minor design flaws (some of which have been fixed in the newer C3000 line & C4000 line of this camera).  These flaws include: 1) easily lost lens cap (I've only lost one so far & it cost $18 to replace), 2) neck strap attachment rings in a bad position, so when worn around the neck, the camera tips "up" rather than sitting comfortably against the chest, 3) some camera features require scrolling through several menus to access or are "difficult to find" in the menus, 4) no USB (my printer has a built-in memory card reader, so this isn't really a problem for me).  Have had instances where the camera does not properly register color--particularly when attempting to photograph close-ups or bunches of red flowers, such as roses, carnations, begonias, etc. or in incandescent light--although later versions of this camera supposedly have improved color processing.  Have found that it's a bit inconvenient & awkward to have to use an adapter ring in order to use filters. I also feel this ring should have come standard with the camera, rather than as an add-on.  Overall, though, I'm happy with the camera & when the "new, improved" versions of this camera come down in price, I'm giving this one to my daughter & getting a newer model.
