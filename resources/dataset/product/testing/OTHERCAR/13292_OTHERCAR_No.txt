            I checked into purchasing the Honda Accord because everyone said it was a great car and that the repairs were minimal.  I also needed a car with a large trunk and could fit 3 large teenage boys.  Well the honda has a large trunk and the backseat is large.  It took me a while to get used to driving it because my other car was boxey and this has a longer front end.  While the drive is good, being a short women has made being confortable in the car next to impossible.
The seats can not be adjusted correctly.  Either I'm too close or I'm too far away from the pedals.  Next the seat back does not adjust upright enough for a short person.  I am always leaning a little backwards.  
The windshield wippers are another problem for a short person, when they are in use they miss cleaning the botton part of the window and this is where my eyesight  is.  I guess whoever created this car was not short.  So my suggestion is when you take a test drive, do it a couple of times and for a longer drive then just five minutes like I did.<br><br>
