            To put this review in perspective, I purchased my 5-speed Spyder in early 2003, as a Toyota Certified vehicle having 6750 on the odometer.
It is used as a daily driver, now having over 21,000 miles on the odometer.

Reliability:  Excellent, with a loose driver-side visor screw the only problem. Toyota service has been excellent.
Oil changes have been done at around 3500 miles, more often than spec'd by the manual.

Performance/handling: On a par with some of the best I have driven/owned(Lotus,Porsche,BMW,Saab,etc.)
The road holding on fast curves is a delight, the steering accurate, cornering sharp, although a touch less roll would be ideal.   Acceleration is smooth throughout the powerband, unlike, say, the Honda S2000 I tested, and more than adequate to merge into 75 MPH traffic. I added a TRD air filter, not much noticable improvement from the significantly better airflow. Oh well, it was only $ 35.
The optional strut reinforcements might help it corner flatter, but they are expensive.


Mileage: Great! I get from 27 to 30 mpg.

Ride: OK for a roadster, but you will be aware of bumps. 
The seats are fine if you are not driving more than an hour or two.  With no cruise, this is not an ideal car for long trips. 

Storage/misc.:  There is precious little(behind the seat, a dollop in front, good glove box) storage, but it held enough for a weekend trip for two. OK, some of it was in the passenger footwell.
The top is quick and easy, although it snaps back too fast sometimes(caught my thumb-ouch!) and other times you have to press it down that last bit. 

Caution: The Spyder does not like rain or slippery roads, on which you will appreciate the advantages of all-wheel or front-wheel drive. 

Appearance: Subjective, but i love it, and everyone who has seen it(not counting magazines and some other posters) agrees. Lots of unsolicited oohs and ahs. 

Perfect second car, or first if you can live with the tight storage and long distance limits.
