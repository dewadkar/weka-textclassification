            i bought a 1996 Mazda 626 in June of 1999 with the intentions of this being a long term reliable car. Thank god i got the extended warranty though. The 626 is a great performer even with the 4 cylinder automatic, but albeit with some troubles. After owning the car for 3 months the Mass air flow sensor went out with 50000 miles on it ($600 repair) and now the transmission is going out (60000 miles,$2000 repair). The transmission is a know problem aspect of the car, and Mazda realizes this, and may cut a break with you on parts and labor (usually 50/50). This will be done on a case by case basis, but be sure to mention Mazda's &quot;good-will program&quot; and they may cut you a break without too much hassle. As for when the car is running fine, it is a great road trip car with ample room and a quiet ride.<br><br>
