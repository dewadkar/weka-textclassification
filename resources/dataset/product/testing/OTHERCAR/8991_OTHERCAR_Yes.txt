            "So this is the flagship of Hyundais second coming? Looks a bit funny." were my friends first words when he saw my rental.

So how is it?

Well, it doesn't look its size, some how the roundish shape fades out  real measurements.
Inside  the personal exterior you get large and spacious  interior.
Comfy seats add the traveling comfort. Very important fact is also the low noise level. Only time I could hear the noise of the powerful engine was during acceleration.
The motor is light metal built. Only problem is that the 2,5 liter engine doesn't give any specialities in the performance but it still moves this 1500 kilo (more than 3000 pounds) ensemble blandly and  painlessly.
Control gives you very active feel to the road and it's variations. Sonatas mirrors are large, work with electricity and have own heating system.
Headlights show pretty narrow area, not enough to the left.
Rearmament is generous, ABS brakes, electronical brake power distribution, all the seatbelts are identical, airbags on the side in front, slide restraint... still you have to buy the air conditioner separately!

My final verdict

I used Sonata for two weeks in summer so I have no idea how it behaves in snow / ice or freezing cold climate.
I drove about 3000 kilometers ( 1800 miles) and I have to say that my back wasn't aching at all, which is a surprise
to a tall person, I'm 5 foot 11, and before trying Hyundai Sonata almost every car (except Saab) has given me a sore back after few miles.
The luggage compartment is good for four to five big suitcases. So even a family of four should be able to fit all stuff for holiday in to the car.
