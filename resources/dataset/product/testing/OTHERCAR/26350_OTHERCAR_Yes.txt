            Truth is I broke down and bought a digital camera because I couldn't get the drivers for my scanner when I bought a new computer.  Sigh.  It's tough being a technodummy.

Oh blessed ignorance!  My Sony DSC-P71 has opened whole new worlds of photographic exploration! I haven't even tried the advanced features, but the "point and shoot" experience has me convinced that I've made a good investment. 

#1: It's easy to use.  As soon as the batteries were charged (charger and one set of batteries included in package) I was able to step out on my porch and take pictures.  Default settings gave me pictures that just blew me away when I ran a slide show on my computer. As time goes by I explore additional features and am always tickled to see that what the instruction manual says really does work for me.

#2: It's relatively inexpensive.  OK, it's not a $29.85 special at Wal-Mart, but it's easily 10 times better than one of those and as experience leads me to needing more features, I find the P71 meets my needs.

#3: If you have a Sony computer with the "Memory Stick" feature it's a snap to view your shots and no additional software needed.  I tried the USB connections on my old Win98 computer and was happy to see all worked smoothly there, too.

Bottom line is; this is a good camera for anyone just entering the digital photography field.  Take it on vacation, shoot your family pics, dress up your web site...try it, you'll like it.
