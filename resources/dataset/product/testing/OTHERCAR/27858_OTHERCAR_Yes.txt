            I own a '94 Dodge Grand Caravan and I love it. This is the fourth minivan I have owned. My husband also has one for his work van. I have found that this van is perfect for my large family. We have four children, two of which are still in car seats and we still have plenty of room for all of us and all of our gear. (we always have a lot of gear) It runs like a dream and very rarely breaks down. All of our vans have been either the Dodge or Plymouth Grand models. Two previous vans had transmissions replaced at 150,000 and 160,000 miles. That was the only major work we have had to do to any of them. I believe with regular maintenance and doing repair work at the time it is needed these vans will go until the owner decides to get a new one.  I feel that these vans are also very safe. My husband recently wrecked his, he hydroplaned on the interstate while it was raining (cruise should not be used in the rain). He rolled it three times and walked away with nothing more than scratches and a pulled muscle in his back. How many cars would you be able to say that about? That van had over 240,000 miles on it, had been hit twice and repaired and ran PERFECTLY and still looked brand new.  These vans also retain their value well. Most people are able to get book value at the very least for these vehicles when they resell them.   I have recommended the Dodge Grand Caravan to several friends and they love them too. I enjoy driving my kids to all of the functions they are involved in and the traveling we do because my van is so comfortable and handles so well. I do not feel like I am driving a van because they do handle so well. I would recommend this model to anyone who is even considering a minivan.<br><br>
