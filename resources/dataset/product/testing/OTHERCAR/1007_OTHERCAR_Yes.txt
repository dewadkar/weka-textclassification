            I set out to buy a new Buick Regal.  So to make sure that it was the car I wanted, I checked out a few others.. the Pontiac Grand Prix, the Oldsmobile Alereo, the Volkswagon Jetta, and the Chevrolet Malibu. I had not even considered the Dodge Intrepid. I generally do not like the Dodge product, seems all I have ever driven had a transmission lag that I did not care too much about.

I had about an hour to waste waiting for a friend to go car shopping with me and the Dodge dealership was the closest one so I stopped in to check out their equalivent to the Regal.  The salesperson showed me a 2000 Intrepid and I liked the car but it was just too much money for my budget.

Two days later I bought a 1998 Intrepid from that dealership.  It has every thing the 2000 had as far as I could tell except the price tag. 

I have not experienced the transmission lag that I was expecting.  Instead this car has both a manual and an automatic transmission.  And it shifts in the automatic mode as expected. It has good accerlation and handles quite nicely. 

The car is designed for aerodynamics, it is low in the front with the tail being higher to give it a very sporty look for a sedan. The blind spots are bigger than many other cars but the power mirrors on either side can be adjusted to keep that from becoming much of a problem.

The car I bought has an infinity sound system in it with cassette, 4 disc cd, am-fm radio and a six speaker system. It comes with a built in adjustable equilizer.  Very nice sound.

The ac/heating system services the back seat passengers with vents placed at the rear of the console. It includes demist vents to both front door windows and rear window defogger. It has automatic climate control to keep you comfortable in all types of tempertures.

It came with power locks, security system, and remote entry to both passenger area and cargo area. It has built in garage door opener and a variety of computerized information available. 

Power seats adjustments for both driver and front passenger. Cruise control and power windows.  It includes air bags for the passenger and driver. The steering colume includes tilt to let the driver adjust to their liking.  

Alloy wheels really make this car look sharp. Anti-lock disc brakes and a traction control switch to use with icy or slick roads.

This is a big car with lots of features and was a trade-in for a new Dodge Neon, since the lady that owned it was small in stature and felt it was just too large to make her feel competent to drive it.

I feel like I have as good a car as the new 2000 model and it fit my budget much nicer. <br><br>
