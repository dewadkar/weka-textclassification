            Love Olympus 35mm cameras but DL-600 is a dog.   Good pictures but glitchy downloads on PC and extremely poor on Mac.  Software with the camera is poor but not not the whole problem.  Will not download to any PC or Mac laptop I have tried it with. 

After 1-1/2 years it has been back for repair twice.  Second out of warranty fix required $150 check to get them to look at it.  They wouldn't accept a PO from a $400M NYSE listed company.  Just think what they would do for a private individual.

By the way they have had the camera for 2 weeks now and still can't tell me how much to fix or when I can expect to see it again.<br><br>
