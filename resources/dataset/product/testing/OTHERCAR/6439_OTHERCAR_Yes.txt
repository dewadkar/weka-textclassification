            The Fujifilm 3800 seemed to be showing up on sale in a lot of the electronics stores, and I was in the market for a new camera.  A friend had an older Fujifilm digital camera that I had used, and I was pleased with it, so I did some quick research and decided to pick this one up while it was still on sale.

Having used a Fujifilm before, I was familiar enough with the layout and functions to begin taking pictures with it right out of the box.  It is relatively intuitive, and a quick glance at the instruction booklet will get you going in a short time.  There were a few things that I hadn&#146t seen before and needed to look up (low light indicators and other graphics in the view screen), but the first day out with a quick glance at the instructions was a breeze.

The zoom lens is both a positive and a negative on this camera.  While it is great to be able to zoom in on features, it also makes the camera harder to pack and carry.  You will not be able to put this one in a coat pocket and be an inconspicuous tourist.  It also adds to the weight of the camera.

The camera uses an XD picture card, and comes with a 16 MB card.  I haven&#146t had any trouble with not having enough space on the card for the pictures that I have taken, but I tend to download the camera every few days.  If the camera is going to be used on a long vacation, or someplace where downloads are not going to be done every few days, it might be a good idea to look into a larger card.

The camera has a USB connection with a cable to connect to a PC, so downloads can be made directly from the camera, or by moving the XD card into a reader connected to a computer.  The camera end of the cable doesn&#146t look like a standard connector, so you will have to bring the cable with the camera if you will be downloading from the camera.  The downloads also require Fuji software, so, if downloads are going to be made to a computer without the software installed, it must be brought along, also.

Additionally, the camera can be used as a web cam, but this requires a 5V adaptor that does not come with the camera, which I thought was a disappointment.

Overall, the camera is a good quality piece of equipment that is easy to use, versatile and fun.
