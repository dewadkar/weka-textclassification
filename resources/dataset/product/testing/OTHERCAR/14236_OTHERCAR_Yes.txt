            The S-10 is going away at the end of this year, and some people are eagerly awaiting its more car-like successor vehicle, meaning that there are very good rebate and financing incentives on the S-10 as of the time of this review. I bought my S-10 knowing that it was a truck, the lowest-priced compact truck with a V6 on the market at the time I bought it, and that's exactly what I got: a truck.

My S-10 is the extended cab LS model with optional V6 and automatic transmission. The LS model adds a CD player, tilt wheel, and cruise control to the base model, and I needed cruise control because I take occasional road trips. I got the extended cab model because the standard cab was very cramped for someone of my height (six feet) and the extended cab lets me lean back some and also has enough room for a couple of large suitcases behind the seats. For a compact truck, the extended cab S-10 is pretty roomy, though don't expect to fit an actual person back there -- it's strictly for groceries and luggage.

Chevrolet's classic 4.3L V-6 engine is basically 3/4ths of the classic Chevrolet 350 cubic inch V-8 Corvette engine, heavily modified over the years to give it a few more manners. It is the most powerful V-6 in terms of torque in its class, only the Dakota with its V-8 has more torque in the compact truck class (albeit at a price that is equal to a full-sized pickup truck in both dollars and fuel economy). In its S-10 incarnation, it pulls like, well, a truck engine, and Chevrolet has been careful to adjust its exhaust note to make it sound a bit like a big rig both at idle and at full moan. It doesn't like revving, but that's not what you do with a truck engine anyhow. Paired with the automatic transmission, it loafs along at 1700 RPM at 60mph. It's a good truck engine, and the strong point of this truck. Do not buy an S-10 with the 4 cylinder engine, the 4 cylinder is grossly underpowered, especially paired with the automatic transmission. The downside of the V6 is gas mileage. While the S-10 gets good gas mileage for a truck, I have averaged everything from 17mpg in the city to 22mpg on one stretch of highway where I was going 55 or 60mph. At 75mph through New Mexico and West Texas, I averaged 19mpg. My average fuel economy thus far in "normal" city driving (75% freeway, 25% surface streets) has been about 19mpg.  

The automatic transmission is rather truck-like itself. It has wide gear spacings to take advantage of the V6 engine's hefty low-end torque, so don't get a 4 cylinder S10 with this transmission (don't get a 4 cylinder S10 period -- only Toyota has a decent 4 cylinder truck engine at the moment, with their 2.7L 4). The automatic transmission is paired with a rather sloshy torque converter that appears to suck quite a bit of power from the engine but is perfect for pulling stumps -- in this incarnation, it's decidedly a truck transmission, not a sports car transmission. Once the torque converter locks up in 4th gear, it's solid as a rock, as it should be. If you want a sporty S-10, don't buy the automatic transmission. Heck, if you want a sporty S-10, you're rather deranged anyhow -- this is a truck, useful for hauling loads of landscaping plants and tools or in its 4wd form for hauling said plants and tools across sandy washes and up rocky slopes, it's not a sports car and never will be no matter how much Chevrolet tried to make it one with various ZR packages. 

Once you get into the truck, the first thing you notice is the cheap upholstery, which is made of the cheapest fabric available. The black upholstery seems to grab cat hairs, which wind their way into the cheap fabric and are almost impossible to remove with the most vigorous of vacuuming. The carpet is poorly fitted and seems to be floating an inch away from the firewall at the front. The vinyl dashboard top has such poor fit and finish that it waves like a sailor saying goodbye to his latest flame as his ship pulls out to sea. Like most S-10's, mine has the standard "split bench" seat. The seat itself is shaped like a clam shell, guaranteed to make you hunch over when you sit in it, rather than having any kind of lower back support. Supposedly the optional bucket seats are much better, but few S-10's are equipped with those. The only thing that makes the cab adequate for longer journeys is the fact that it's so roomy for a compact truck, allowing you to adjust the seat back to various angles and move your legs around. Don't buy an S-10 for comfort, and buy the extended cab if you are more than 5' 6" tall -- at 5' 11", the standard cab did not allow me to stretch and lean back and was somewhat cramped. It's a truck, not a luxury car. Don't expect luxury.

Repair parts for the S-10 are cheap, and lots of people know how to work on them. This truck has been in production for ten years now, so both parts suppliers and mechanics have had plenty of time to learn it and there are millions of the things in junkyards from Maine to California. It's good that parts and maintenance are cheap, because the S-10 has a poor reliability reputation. The S-10, unlike more modern designs, requires a lot of maintenance, with many fittings that must be greased at every oil change and an oil change interval of only 3,000 miles under normal use. The underhood is cramped with the wide 90 degree V8-derived V6 engine, which is much wider than the 60 degree V6 engines that the original S-10 was designed for, and is also cramped because of all the innovations such as ABS and full electronic engine controls that have happened in the 10 years since it was designed, all of which have big bulky boxes under the hood in areas that were open space in the original S10. So do-it-yourselfers can work on it, but will be cursing GM's engineers while doing so (but how does that make it different from any other GM product of the past 25 years?!).  

Quality-wise, my S10, aside from the wavy dash and poorly fitted carpet, also slung off one of its front wheel grease caps during the first 500 miles. It was caught inside the hubcap and made a horrible clatter, alerting me to the problem, and it was easy enough to put it back on, but this definitly was worrisome. Underneath the truck, I found oil drops at the bottom of the oil filter, and transmission fluid on the bottom of the transmission. I wiped them off and the drops have not reoccurred, making me believe they were squirted when sloppy assembly line workers filled the transmission and crankcase with the proper fluids or allowed the engine or transmission to flop on its side during assembly, but again, this is something that has never happened with any other car I've owned. The S10's fit, finish, and assembly definitely do not inspire confidence. Buy it because it's cheap and has a powerful engine and is good at hauling stuff, not because you're expecting Mercedes-like quality. 

Handling-wise, the S-10 is competent. That's all. It's not a sports car. The steering is an old-fashioned recirculating ball with pitman arm setup, and while reasonably precise, is somewhat numb and definitely not going to be confused with a modern rack-and-pinion setup. The S-10 handles competently and in a controlled manner, the back end can be controlled easily when you spin a wheel, and it definitely handles better than the Ford Ranger that I owned in the mid 1990's (that thing was downright dangerous, the swing-arm "twin I-Beam" suspension caused severe oversteer during emergency maneuvers and could cause a front wheel to tuck under and flip the entire truck in worst case scenarios), but it's a truck, not a sports car. As far as maneuverability goes, even with the lengthy 122" wheelbase my extended-cab S10 has no problems with parking lot maneuvers, though you must of course keep the length in mind when doing so. I understand that the 4WD model won't turn its front wheels as far and maneuver as well as my 2WD model. 

Oh, BTW, the air conditioner has no problem with Phoenix AZ summer weather. It is cold and works well. And that third door on the extended cab works great, allowing easy loading of the area behind the seats. As far as the bed goes, I'm disappointed that there are no bed stake holes, but it does have hooks for hooking straps to secure your load and a lip under the bed rails for hooking bungee cords, and the bed is rather nicely laid out for a work truck. 

Ride-wise, it rides well for a truck. The long wheelbase of the extended cab model helps smooth out the hobby-horse ride I remember from other small pickup trucks, and the back doesn't skitter across expansion joints like with some small trucks. Do not, however, expect a car-like ride. There is still more vibration and up-down pitching than you'd get from a car, and the suspension feels underdamped and busy when not loaded up. Noise-wise, I've heard worse, but it's definitely not luxury-car silent.

Summary: The S-10 is what you buy if you need an inexpensive work truck that has a stump-puller engine with a cab that is reasonably comfortable and roomy. It is not what you buy if you want a "sport truck" for stylin', or whatever. Buy it for what it is, and you will be one satisfied customer -- it is a workhorse, and does everything a truck is supposed to do from haul a load to pull stumps. Buy it as something it is not -- a "sport truck" -- and you will be sorely disappointed. Wait for the S-10's successor for something that's more civilized and "sporty", or look at the Ford Ranger or Toyota Tacoma.
