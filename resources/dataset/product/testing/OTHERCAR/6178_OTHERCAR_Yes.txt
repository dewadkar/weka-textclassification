            The Chevy venture is a versatile vehicle that I highly recommend for the family on the go.  It's easy to drive and handles well in different road conditions.

We use our Venture every day.  It gets good gas mileage as compared to other mini-vans.  The average tank runs for approximately 600 miles before having to refuel.  I live in CT where the gas price for regular unleaded gasoline is approximately $1.45 a gallon.  For $25-30 I can completely fill the tank.  

The seats are one of its best features.  They are easily adjustable and can be removed with the pop of a few buttons.  The van comes with netting to store valuable cargo such as groceries or baby equipment.

On a scale of a 1-10 I would rate the Venture a 9.  It's economical and reliable as well as appealing to the eye.

One thing I would change about the van is to move the cd/tape holder up into a more convenient reaching location so that you don't have to bend while driving.  However, the audio storage area is hidden to reduce the temptation of theft.  The venture does have cup holders built into the passenger seat backs.  This way you can push the seat down in front of you and leave your drinks in a convenient spot.  And they even included square holders for juice boxes!<br><br>
