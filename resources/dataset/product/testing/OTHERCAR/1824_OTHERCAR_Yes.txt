            The GS MX-3 was the first car I ever purchased new.  It was a 1994 model in Hunter Green and it was also the first V-6 engine I ever purchased as well (and have never looked back since).  Of course, at 1.8 liters, there are 4 cylinder models that are much larger, but this was a sweet little engine.

It was also mated very well to the 5 sp manual transmission.  It had good midband power and was decently suited for the highway.  While the seats are well formed, they are hard on the back during long trips.

While I switched out the radio and speakers, I had nothing bad to say about the stock system.  It was decent, but being an ex-party DJ, I needed something with a touch more oomph...if you know what I mean.  The easy locations of the speakers make this car a breeze to update.

In the 60K of which I have driven it (and the 30K more my brother had driven it), I have had no repairs other than replacing the tires (which were excellent Yokohama's).  While the car looks very small from the outside, it is actually very roomy in the front and very decent in the back as well (a true 2+2).

If you are looking for reliable and cheap on the gas, but a sweet revving V6, I highly recommend this car.<br><br>
