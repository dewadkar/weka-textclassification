            <b>COMPANY HISTORY:</b>

The history of Audi is certainly one of the most diverse in more than 100 years of automobile history. Its tradition in car and motorcycle manufacturing dates back to the 19th century, when pioneering engineer August Horch founded the company that would one day become Audi AG. Four automakers merged in 1932 under the emblem of the Four Rings to form Auto Union, and the Swabian company NSU from Neckarsulm, which joined in 1969. Together they enriched the worldwide automotive industry and decisively influenced the technical development of the motor car. The technically innovative image of the two brands, Audi and NSU, led ultimately to the slogan coined in 1971 which still applies today: Vorsprung durch Technik, which means Innovation through Technology.

<b>PROS:</b>

There are so many good things to mention about the Audi A6.  IMO, the most important feature is the all-wheel-drive Quattro system.  My three previous cars didn&#146t have this and you can tell in bad weather (i.e. heavy rain) that in the A6 Quattro, you have more traction and control than in any front or rear wheel drive vehicle.  There&#146s also the AT&#146s Tiptronic control which basically is like driving a stick, except there&#146s no clutch necessary to change gears.  This is especially useful in sharp inclines or steep declines in the roads and it can make driving the A6 a little more sporty/fun.  It&#146s equipped w/ ABS (Anti-lock Braking System) which assists in emergency braking situations and gives the driver more control of the vehicle.  Also, it doesn&#146t cause the tires to bald in an emergency stop.  The Bose stereo is a must-have if you enjoy music while driving (which 99% of us do).  It has a very good range of mid and high frequencies as well as the Bose subwoofer in the trunk that&#146s nicely hidden away.  Also, the 6-disc changer is also hidden in the trunk on the other side of the subwoofer.  The dashboard is lighted in a nice, red digital display.  Some may complain that it&#146s difficult to read in bright sunlight, but I haven&#146t had that problem.  The dashboard display features are unique.  It can show the length of time you&#146ve been driving, the mpg overall that you&#146re getting as well as list what gear you&#146re on and what stereo mode you&#146re in (CD, cassette or radio station).  Of course, if you don&#146t desire to see these features displayed, you can turn it off.  As for power windows, they&#146re all one-touch up or down.  This is very convenient as many vehicles only offer one-touch down for the driver&#146s side.  Plus, the power seats offer lumbar support which is pleasant to have and I highly recommend using it for improved back support, especially on long drives.  Also, the driver's seat has 3-memory settings which definitely comes in handy, so multiple drivers won't have to fiddle w/ all the power seat controls.  The real wood trim is a welcomed relief, too.  It&#146s gives the car the luxury look/feel, along w/ the leather seats.  In the near-luxury and luxury car division, who wants to pay premium prices for simulated wood trim?  With Audi vehicles, there&#146s no worry.  Also, the dial to open the sunroof is easy to operate and the sunroof visor, if purchased, eliminates more wind noise when the sunroof is open.  The trunk space is surprisingly spacious.  It doesn&#146t look as big on the outside, but when the trunk opens, especially when the rear seats are folded down, you can fit just about anything back there.  A good feature on the rear folding seats is that you&#146re able to lock it w/ your car key.  The remote key itself is unique.  The key folds out at the push of a button and on the remote you have three commands: lock, unlock and trunk open.  

The driving experience is another big plus w/ this vehicle.  The A6 accelerates smoothly and quietly.  It can get a little noisier using the Tiptronic feature, but that&#146s because the rpm&#146s will climb up much higher than the AT would do.  Also, in Tiptronic mode, if you forget to change gears and the rpm&#146s hit above 7000, it will automatically shift up for you, a safety feature which comes in handy.  If you care about your car, you don&#146t ever want to red-line it often.  And the steering/handling is good, even w/ the stock rim/tire combo.  Most A6 buyers will be satisfied w/ this setup.  In sharp, accelerated turns, there&#146s some body lean, but Audi&#146s Quattro system keeps all four wheels planted on the ground and in constant motion.  And Audi&#146s struts/springs help as well, too.  So, there&#146s less, if any, chance of fish-tailing on a turn.  Whether it&#146s stop and go traffic or a long, relaxing trip, the A6 is a pleasure to drive where ever you go.


<b>CONS:</b>

First, there&#146s the high price, especially brand new models.  But it&#146s a luxury European car, so that&#146s expected.  Second, for 1998 - 1999, there was only one type of engine available (2.8L V6) which lacks the necessary hp & torque to move this heavy vehicle (over 3700 lbs & 0 to 60 mph in @ 9 seconds), (see OPTIONAL/AFTERMARKET EQUIPMENT for advice on how to gain more power).  Third, the standard sized tires and wheels are too small/thin which makes for a soft, non-sporty handling.  Fourth, I find it inconvenient that the CD changer is in the trunk instead of being in the glove compartment or built into the stereo deck.  Fifth, as w/ any luxury car make, going to the Audi dealership for maintenance is expensive.  Even the simple oil change and vehicle inspection can run you @ $150.  Last, Audi offers FWD w/ traction control, which is a con for marketing reasons, IMO.  I guess there&#146s people out there that doesn&#146t want the Quattro system, but why??  Isn&#146t the Quattro system one of the biggest reasons why you buy an Audi??  This isn&#146t really that bad because FWD is @ 200 lbs. lighter; hence, it&#146s more fuel efficient.  But in bad weather (rain or snow), when you compare any car w/ 2-wheel drive and traction control vs. an all-wheel drive vehicle, guess who has better traction overall?  Enough said.


<b>MY BUYING EXPERIENCE:</b>

I bought my Audi A6 2.8 Quattro, fully loaded w/ the royal blue leather interior, car phone & Bose stereo system, from the Diablo Audi dealership in Concord, CA in May/June 2001.  To make a long story short, they took my trade-in (1997 Lexus ES 300) and gave me the highest trade-in value possible (trust me, I called many dealerships and inquired).  Then, the Fleet Mgr. stayed w/ me from @ 7:30 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. to not only make sure the paperwork was completed, but to make sure I understood all the functions/features of my new (used) vehicle.  In all my years of buying vehicles (Toyota Paseo, Mitsubishi Eclipse, Lexus ES 300 & now, Audi A6 Quattro), I&#146ve never experienced such excellent customer service as I have at the Diablo Audi dealership.  I mentioned this because the whole experience of buying a car can be very stressful.  At this dealership, not only did I finally get the car I&#146ve always wanted, but I got friendly service, too, which is hard to find these days.


<b>OPTIONAL AFTER-MARKET EQUIPMENT:</b>

I&#146m the type that&#146s always looking to make a good thing ever better.  And maybe this will give you, the consumer, some ideas on how to upgrade your A6, should you choose to buy one.  So, here&#146s what I&#146ve done to upgrade my Audi A6 Quattro:  18x8 Borbet Type R wheels ($800; As of 4/13/03, I've cracked two Borbet wheels in the last 1.5 years and this style wheel has now been discontinued, at least for the 18" size.  After a couple emails of complaints/concerns to the Borbet company, I only received one response stating that they'll reply to my emails soon.  It's been more than a few months now and counting and I'm very disappointed in their lack of customer service.  So, I just had the rim repaired at Wheels America at http://www.fixrim.com/), Kumho Ecsta Supra 225/40 WR 18 tires ($520), Eibach Pro-Kit springs (1.4&#148 front / 1.3&#148 rear) ($250), (2) Magnaflow mufflers w/ 3&#148 angle-cut stainless steel tips & (2) resonators ($650), K&N drop-in air filter cartridge ($45), Magnecor KV85 Race wires ($185) & Denso Iridium spark plugs ($75).  Plus, tinting the windows ($150) and a sunroof visor ($30) was also added.  An additional option, if you like the 2.8 but crave more power, is to add an Eaton Supercharger offered by PES-tuning.com.  It costs @ $4995 + $500 for the new Tiptronic chip + another $500 or so to install it.  Overall, it will add "95 hp" to the stock vehicle&#146s performance!  An expensive upgrade, but it's your only major 'hp-boost' option if you don't want to fork out the extra dough to buy the 2.7T (250 hp) or the top of the line 4.2 (300 hp).


<b>CONCLUSION:</b>

The Audi A6 Quattro is a European luxury model which competes nicely w/ other makes such as the BMW 5-series or the E-class Mercedes-Benz.  But BMW&#146s 5-series doesn&#146t offer AWD (the 3-series does) & Mercedes&#146 4-Matic is not as well-known as Audi&#146s Quattro system.  So, if you&#146re looking for a luxury used car, look no further because Audi&#146s A6 may just be the vehicle you&#146ve been searching for.
