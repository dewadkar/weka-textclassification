            I purchased a 1991 Eagle Talon (Mitsubishi Eclipse) about three months ago for only three thousand dollars.  At that time, it already had over one hundred thousand miles on it, so I was skeptical about how long it would last.  I have been very impressed about how well the car is running and how much performance is crammed into it.  It features a 2 liter DOHC that provides 135 horsepower.  It's definitely a quick car, yet insurance is low on it.  It has been very very reliable, I haven't had one problem at all with it yet, it starts up right away every time, and runs smoothly.  Overall, it's a very could &quot;mini sports car&quot; for the money.  In my opinion these cars are very under-rated.  The only problem with the car is the slight road noise when driving over bumpy or rough roads, other than that it's a great car.<br><br>
