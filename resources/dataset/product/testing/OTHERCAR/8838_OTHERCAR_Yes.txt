            Years ago someone in my family had a Honda Accord and always talked about how good a car it was.  That was the early 90's and it still is true today that the Honda Accord is a great car.

The Honda Accord has been around since the late 70's and is still going strong.  It is Honda's flagship car and one of America's favorites also. Let me tell you the great things about this car.

Firstly, it is a very reliable automobile. Most Honda's last for many years on the same engine and usually do not need much maintenance.  I have talked to mechanics and most have always said that a Honda is the best car to buy simply because of its reliability. In fact one mechanic said that the Honda is the only car he would buy for his mother.

Secondly, the Accord has a very smooth, and yet quite ride.  Going down the highway it seems at times like you are floating on air. Of all the cars out on the market the Honda Accord is one of the smoothest rides around.

Thirdly, the interior and exterior are fine examples of excellent craftsmanship.  The exterior of the car is sleek yet simple. It is a great example of the style that has become so popular. The interior is very comfortable and also spacious. This car is good for long trips and everyone will feel good riding in it.

Finally the Honda Accord is not too expensive.  Paying such little money for such a great car is really the best deal there is around. This vehicle is great for anyone, from young to old.
