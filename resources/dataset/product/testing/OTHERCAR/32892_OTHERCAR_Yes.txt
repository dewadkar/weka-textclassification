            I got the Canon S300 for $400 through a special eBay dealer.  It is indeed tiny and can fit into your pocket.  It feels very "thick"... but not heavy.  It's very durable when you feel it.  What attracted me was the size and the ease of pointing and shooting.
Taking picture is a snap - point and shoot.  There is a manual mode, but you cannot manually focus too much.  There is a manual-like focus option, but it's very general.  For example, scenery style vs potrait style.  
When taking pictures, I've noticed that they come out darker than they actually should.  But using any image program and turning up the contract and brightness will fix the problem.  

Sometimes taking still photos, the pictures don't come in clear - perhaps it is a lighting issue.  And then sometimes taking still pictures come in SUPER clear!  I don't know what is making it come out fuzzy sometimes, but it is quote annoying.
Forget taking motion shots like cars moving or people running because it'll come in fuzzy - the shutter speed is too slow.

The flash is weak.  Try taking a picture in the dark with the flash and it's very.  

The camera only comes with a cheesy 8 MB flash card - that is only equivalent to 15 super hi-res pictures.  In low-res mode, you can get about 30 pictures.  I bought a 256 MB flash card memory and I can take about 2,000 low-res pictures and about 600 hi-res pictures.  The hi res is 1024x768.  Low res is 640x480.  To be truthful, taking high-res is kind of useless unless you want a detailed close up.

This camera has a 3x zoom PLUS a 8x digital zoom.  The digital zoom is nice for those closeups.  But it doesn't come into focus that well.  

This thing can record movies also.  With my 256 MB flashcard memory, I can record high res movies for about 20 minutes.  The only annoying thing I found is that it can only do 30 second interval recordings.  So it's not 20 minutes straight, but 30 second intervals.  With a 8 MB flashcard, you can only get 8 seconds high res.  It also records sound, but you cannot hear sound on the playback on the camera since there are no speakers.  The movies are saved either in AVI or Quicktime format.

This camera has a small LCD screen on the back.  With the screen, you can review/preview pictures, review movies, take pictures, and stuff like that.  

This camera doesn't come with a carry case, but with a arm strap.  

The battery life is pretty poor.  It has a total battery life of about 2 hours or a little more.  I don't know why, but I read on other reviews that this battery does not warn of low battery usage.  On my camera, it tells me by flashing a little battery icon on the little LCD display.  That's when I know it's getting low.
Overall, it's a great camera to take for those scenic moments or with friends.
