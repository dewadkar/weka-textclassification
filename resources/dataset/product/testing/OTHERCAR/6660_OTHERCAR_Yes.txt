            When I went to the autonation lot I was actually expecting to drive away in a 2000Prism, but I saw a beautiful blue Tracker at the front of the lot as we entered and decided after test driving several cars tht I wanted to give it a spin.
It was exactly what I was looking for. Although I do not have children yet, I wanted my investment to last me for some time, so I was looking for something for when that time comes without being too &quot;family car&quot; yet. I also did not want an SUV which was too big, as they seem to be getting bigger each year.
The 4 door tracker was perfect.

It is very spacious. There is leg room in front an back seats and plenty of head room. The trunk/ cargo area is perfect for grocery shopping and I love that the rear hatch opens  like a door rather than upwards.

The power transmition adds that sporty feel that I was used to from driving a Camero for a long time, and I like that this feature is switch operated.

Everything is located very conveinently. The steering wheel is the most comfortable I have every seen and forms right to your hards in any variety of positions. I do think that the turn signal lever should be longer because you need to reach around the steering wheel to acess it.
Another picky thing that I don't like is the construction of the inside door handles, they seem very weak, like they will break off if the door were to be slightly jammed.

The truck drives smoothly and very quietly. It is somewhat difficult to drive in the wind. I haven't used it for any long road trips yet.

One other thing I'd like to mention is that it does not have antilock breaks and does slide easily on slick roads so be careful and don't stop too fast!

Overall I love my Tracker!!! all the good definately outways the few things I would change.<br><br>
