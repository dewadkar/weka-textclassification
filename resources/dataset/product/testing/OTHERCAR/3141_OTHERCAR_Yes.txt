            I purchased a 3 yr old 2000 Hyundai Elantra GLS recently after considerable testing and comparing with other cars in the segment. My car luckily has low mileage for 3 years. It has a nice smooth feel and sporty acceleration when two people are in it, but with 4 adults sitting you can realize that the car is not a Taurus or a Camry. Especially on uphill climbs. Yet its got a great price tag and Hyundai image is improving among used dealers and consumers alike. <p> The <b>sunroof</b> is really nice and the AC is quite good. Actually if the sunroof is used, you can cut back on the AC usage. I like the music system too. Controls are easy to see and reach for except maybe the wiper controls (hard to easy- easy to reach though.) Soon after I bought I took it on a 200 mi trip to Philly. It handled quite well in the rain too, but I was just a bit nervous as I drove at 1-5 am.
Overall this car is a better buy when it is new. After 2001, the car's styling has Improved considerably and it looks really nice.
