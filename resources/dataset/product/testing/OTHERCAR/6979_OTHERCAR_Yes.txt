            I drive a Full Size, K-15, 1994 Chevrolet Blazer.  It is a family car, it was passed down to me a week or so after my older brother was killed in a motorcycle accident.  He never let me drive it when he was alive, he was always very nitpicky with his car.  My younger brother is like that-he has a Chevy truck, and is just as nitpicky as my older brother was like when his truck.  I guess me being in the middle, am not that obsessed with cars.  I don't treat it like garbage, but I dont obsessively wash and wax it like they do.  Anyways...I'll get back to work!

This was the last year that they called them "Blazers".  In 1995, they started calling them 'Tahoes'.  Before, the mini blazers were the ones that were called 'Tahoes' while the Big ones were called 'Blazers'  Chevrolet simply switched the names, which kind of irritated me and my older brother.  I mean, you hear 'Blazer' and you think of something that is 'big and strong' looking, right?

Even though this car is 10 years old now, it is still in good shape.  That's because I always take it in for routine maintenance.  My thinking is this-yeah it might seem tedious and expensive to take it in every 3 months for service, but it is very costly to wait until something breaks down.  Would you rather keep up with basic service, paying maybe $40, or wait until you need to spend $1000's to replace the transmission?  You do the math.

What I like about this is that I just feel safe driving a truck.  If someone hits me from the side, at least I am high up.  If I were in a small car and some big truck hit me in the side I would be seriously injuried or decapitated.

I also like the Blazer because it is an all year round car, because it is a truck and trucks (most) have 4*4.  When the roads or slick, or I see that I have gotten myself stuck in some snow, I just put it in 4 wheel drive and am out of the mess in a second. The engine in this is a V-6, I believe.

The anti-lock brakes on here are a good feature.  I think in the mid 1990's they started to make more and more trucks and blazers came with anti-lock brakes.  This is good so my brakes don't lock up.  As well, I don't have to put chains on my tires as I have seen some people put on their cars, just so they can have more traction.Even for a truck this thing gets up and goes pretty fast.

I also like the big consul that I have right by me.  I can pull the back part of it out, and my back passengers can put two drinks there, and plus there are cup holders right by their left/right arm.  I just wish that the cup holders were a little deeper and wider.  It's a pain when I get a large drink and have to hold it in my lap while I am driving.  I keep $200 spare cash in there, which is good, since I can lock the the thing with a key.  So this one time when I had my little theif of a cousin sitting in my car while I went into the store to get something, he couldn't get in there to fool around.  

There is one thing I don't like-it's the back window, tail gate thing.  Yes, I can press a button inside the car, and it is unlocked in the back.  I still have to get out to open the gate up, whereas a new truck that my parents bought the tail gate can automatically open up by itself, as that is a new feature in their truck.  (Sorry, I forgot what kind of truck it was-I think it was a 2003 GMC.  I'll have to wait until I go home again to see what type it is.)

But back to the back window-you have to be careful if there is ice on it.  This past December, I went to open the back up to put my luggage in there on my way home for winter break.  I thought I had the thing fully cleared off of ice, but apparently there was still some hidden ice there that didn't allow it to fully open.  The thing came crashing down on my head.  Thankfully my neighbors weren't watching when that happened! Of course sometimes, even when I press the button to open it from inside it doesn't unlock it.  That means I have to walk back around, press the button again (harder) or just open it with my keys.

The back bench is neat.  I almost forgot to mention that.  You can fold it down.  So if you have a long object, or just lots of boxes, and luggage you're hauling, it comes in real handy.  You just pull the lever right in the middle of the bench and it folds down for you.  It's kind of pain when you are closing it, because the big, thick plastic folds in there get in the way.

My blazer handles well, the accelator isn't real sensitive as there are with newer trucks.  You don't have to press down real hard to get it up to speed, but then again it's not so sensitive.  It is easy to pass people, and it takes corners fairly well, but then again I don't go zooming fast around the corners to see it's limit.  (I dont want to!)

There is one good thing about the back-I don't need to fully open it to get stuff in the back.  There is the door, yes, and then there is just a way to open the glass part.  As well, my back windows have a windshield wiper.

The other problem was that there wasn't a lot of room to install the CD player that my older brother put it.  We had to put it right behind the back seat, it wouldn't fit right into the counsel.  

The starter was able to last me ten years.  I had to go to Sears Autocenter, after someone helped me jump start my truck to have a new one replaced.  The mechanic told me I had a pretty good truck for it to go 10 years without having to replace the starter.  Ironically, I went to that same place a week earlier to have a new battery put in, as it had been 5 years since I had done that.

But, I would say I am pretty happy with this truck.  I don't remember how much it was when my dad bought it for my brother for a high school graduation gift.  It was not cheap but it was not as expensive as some other new trucks at the time.
