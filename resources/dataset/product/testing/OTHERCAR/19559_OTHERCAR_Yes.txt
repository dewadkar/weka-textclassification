            My husband's mother has a Suburban.  This truck is great.  You could shop forever and still not fill it up.  HA! HA!  There is plenty of room, whether you are in the front seat or in the back.  

The only thing bad about it is the gas mileage.  It gets very very low mileage, 10 - 15 miles a gallon.  It has a huge gas tank because of that.  It holds over 40 gallons of gas, and it knows how to drink the gas too!  So I guess that would be a con.  That is the only one though!! 

The front bucket seats are very comfortable. It  has heated seats, lumbar support, and a lot  of other stuff  just to make sure you get comfortable.  When all three benches are installed in the truck, there is enough room for about 8 people to be comfortable.   My mother in law, however, does not keep all of the seats in the truck.  She uses the truck at work to haul supplies in.  This gives her plenty of room, and then some

The SUV is white with gray interior.  It is a big SUV.  There is plenty of room for seven to eight people.  It has a very nice sound system in it.  There is a cd player.  There are cup holders everywhere.    There are cup holders in the front for the driver and passenger.  There are cup holders in the bench seats also.    There is a big console for cds and stuff.  There is a change holder.  There is plenty of room for sunglasses and such.  There are even cubby holes back in the back seats.

The size makes it a little difficult backing up.  It is a huge SUV.  Once you get used to driving it you are fine. The driving is great.  It handles like a car.  It is four wheel drive.  This is great in the snow. As you know, I am from Tennessee, and we LOVE to go muddin'!!  I haven't gotten the chance to stick this big bad baby in the mud, but I can only imagine the fun!!  As long as I don't sink.  This is a big truck!  Oh well that is another story!

The air conditioner and heater is split up, like in big vans.  There is air in the front seat and 1st bench.  The 2nd and 3rd bench have their own air.  The driver has control of the air.  However there is a switch that you can flip and then you can control the air from the back seats.  There are power windows and door locks.

Now if  I can just keep my Mustang and get one of these I will be doing great!!  I like this SUV.  There is only three in my family, but I think I would like to have one of these!!  I think it would be good to haul stuff around in.  It is kind of like a newer version of my brother's Chevrolet Silverado Z-71, just with more passenger room.

Please leave me comments about what you thought about my review!!

Thank you for reading and have a good night!!
