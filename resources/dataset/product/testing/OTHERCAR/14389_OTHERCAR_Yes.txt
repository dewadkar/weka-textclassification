            When I first decided that I wanted a digital camera, I didn't know where to start.  Megapixels confused me, quality was a concern, and prices were a little intimidating.  I asked some friends, read up about the different technologies online, and got a better idea about what I wanted.  A friend recommended Fuji's line because of their accurate color technology, and after she showed me some of her photos, I was sold.  For the price, I still agree that Fuji gives you the most dollar-for-dollar.

Now, I feel a little bit more comfortable with the world of digital photography, I know the lingo, what's good, what's bad, etc.  The Fujifilm FinePix 2300 would be my top recommendation to anyone buying their first digital camera.

Lets start with the simplicity of use.  Right out of the box I was able to stick batteries in the camera (it comes with 4 AA alkaline batteries, which don't last for long) and take good quality pictures by just pushing the button.  The software installation is simple, just hook the camera up to the computer with the provided USB cable and put the Installation CD in and you're set.  I was amazed how good my very first pictures turned out, the color was great, with or without flash, and I could touch up any red eye or discoloration with the included software.

The camera came with an 8mb SmartMedia card which I found to fill up a little to fast.  On the lowest picture quality you get about 60 pictures on it, on the highest you get about 12.  I recommend picking up another card with your camera since they are relatively cheap (I found a 32mb card on eBay for less than $20).

The camera does most of the work for you, but you can adjust some aspects if you desire.  There are 6 different white balance settings, 4 different types of flash, and the EV goes from +1.5 to -0.9.  The automatic features seem to work rather well for most pictures, and the colors are very vibrant.  In low light conditions, the camera tends to make everything have a warmer tone, with lots of oranges and reds.  The camera is fixed focus, so your pictures are pretty clear at any distance.  For close up shots there is a "macro" setting which keeps high details and crisp edges for things that are less than a foot away.

My biggest complaint about this camera is the digital zoom.  It comes with a 2.5x digital zoom, but you can only zoom to 2.5x when the camera is on it's lowest quality setting.  You can zoom to 1.3x on the lowest and medium setting, and there is no zoom on the highest setting.  Also, as with most digital cameras, battery life is pretty bad.  I would recommend buying some rechargeable AA batteries to save some money, because it does really add up.  The only other problem I have is the lens is always exposed, and it could be scratched, although my camera has been in some pretty abusive situations (being in the bottom of a backpack, left sitting outside, etc.) and it hasn't scratched yet.

Overall, I would recommend this camera to any beginners, or just to keep with you in a bag or glove box to take pictures when you need them.  It is defiantly the best bargain for the price, but you still get what you pay for.
