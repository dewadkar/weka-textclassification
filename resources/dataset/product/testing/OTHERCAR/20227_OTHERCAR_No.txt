            I am startled by how much praise this car is receiving here! Everyone considering this model, do yourself a favor. Head over to Edmunds.com and check out their &quot;Town Hall&quot; section. See what kind of reviews the Malibu is getting....this car is nothing more than a problematic rattle-trap. In the 1 1/2 years I've owned it, I have had the following repairs (which, as proven on Edmunds, are NOT isolated problems!):

Defective rotors replaced twice
Defective stabilizer shaft &amp; insulator replaced twice
Serpentine belt damaged due to manifold/fuel pump massacre underneath the hood
Fuel pump replaced
Manifold seals replaced
Air bag mechanism replaced
Bushings replaced on both axles...twice
Unfixable rattles and squeaks eminating from the dashboard and door panels...very LOUD rattles and squeaks, mind you
and the finale....the head gasket cracked at just 30K miles. This resulted in consistently burning antifreeze and plumes of smoke coming from the engine. With the warranty almost over, I know that the end is near for the engine.....

I traded in the heap of garbage and bought a Camry. If driving a V6 at a low cost is a big thing to you, check out the Taurus instead. They seem to be a bit less problematic than the Malibu.<br><br>
