            I've had a Creative Webcam Go Plus that I've used for video-conferencing via the web, which I've also used as a pocketable digicam, but since I'm the one who takes pictures when someone here at home celebrates his/her birthday, I've always felt the need for a worthier digicam (or a REAL digicam). Thing is, I just kept putting buying a better digicam off.

Then it hit me when my sister got a Canon Powershot A40. What a cool gizmo! Although it took great pictures and is overall a great product, I felt that I'd be happier if I got something else. (Why get two A40s? Variety is the spice of life, and surely it isn't the only nice camera around.)

The way I came across the Olympus Camedia D-550 (actually, it's called the C-300 in my part of the world) is quite by chance, but I sure am glad I did. While most 3.2-megapixel digicams would cost you around $420, the Olympus D-550 came in at a very competitive price of just $310 (even less expensive than the 2.0-megapixel A40!)! At this price, anyone would be very skeptic. After all, pay cheap, get cheap.

So I took time comparing the D-550 with other 3.0- or 3.2-megapixel cameras. I've read a lot of reviews and downloaded unaltered sample pics, comparing it to the Canon Powershot S30, Fujifilm Finepix A303, Pentax Optio 330GS, Kodak EasyShare DX4330, etc. (I also read about 2.0-megapixel models from diff. manufacturers.) And the thing I realized is, there's just no camera (at least in the 3.0-megapixel category or this price range) that takes perfect pictures for every imaginable situation. There's a camera that performed well in outdoor shots, but failed miserably in indoor with flash shots. Another took indoor shots quite well, but suffered outdoors. And the A40? It's unbeatable outdoors, but with macro, it's not something to write home about (I need to take closeups once in a while). As for the D-550, it's very good outdoors, with very sharp detail throughout the image (even at just 1024 x 768), but it has a terrible time with rooms that use warm white lighting when shooting with no flash at night.

The thing is, you have to consider what you will be using the camera for. I wanted to replace my Creative Webcam Go Plus primarily because I was tired of taking pictures with no flash at night (and don't think the Webcam has exposure controls, etc.). So obviously, I'm going to be using the flash indoors, where the D-550, in my opinion, does a better job than the other 3.0-megapixel cameras I've read about (and seen sample images of). Besides, because we celebrate birthdays at night and we use warm white lighting, the flash would be a real necessity.

Pictures taken indoors with no flash and using warm white incandescent room lighting result in a very warm appearance (orange color cast) of the image, and changing between the White Balance presets (Daylight, Overcast, Incandescent, Fluorescent) doesn't help. Turn off flash only when shooting in rooms with white fluorescent room lighting. Also, shooting indoors (with warm white room lighting) with flash results in little noise being present in dark areas of the picture. But with other 3.0-megapixel digicams also having noise like this and costing $100 or so more, you'd quickly forgive the D-550 for such a shortcoming. Another concern is the camera&#146s build quality. The paint feels rough and looks to me like it will fade a year or two down the road. Lastly, while you probably can take lots of photos with a set of batteries, you'd probably want to 'let the batteries rest' from time to time, else the two LEDs beside the viewfinder will blink to signify weak batteries. I've only used the included Alkaline cells (which, some say, don't last long inside digicams) and a set of 1300mAh NiMH cells. I'll update this review once I've managed to grab a set of 1800mAh NiMH cells.

Update : With 1850mAh cells, I was able to run the camera for three days, LCD always on. I was able to fill the entire 128MB SmartMedia card (purchased separately), as compared to just one day for a set of Alkaline cells.

On the good side though, the camera takes very good outdoor shots (sharp, bright pictures with a wide dynamic range). Colors also come out very nicely, indoors or outdoors (except in the aforementioned situation when shooting in a room with warm white lighting, flash turned off). Also, it's so easy to use; I probably knew how to access 85% of the camera's functions without touching the manual. And about the cheap-feeling paint, Olympus is thoughtful enough to include a leather case (to help maintain the camera's appearance). Some manufacturers sell the leather case separately at prices that would make you feel you're being ripped off.

Overall, it's a great package. When you consider that sharpness, color and dynamic range are very good, and the camera&#146s outstanding user-friendliness, you'd forgive the camera for its occasional noise (dark areas only, where the flash doesn't reach well enough) and difficult time when shooting inside rooms with warm white lighting with no flash. There is no perfect camera in this category or price range, but the D-550 sure is hard to beat.
