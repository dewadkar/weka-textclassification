            I purchased my 88 New Yorker Landeau in 1996 from my Grandfather when he could no longer drive it due to illness. It has run beautifully ever since! It is a smoothe ride, very dependable, and very safe to drive.

I have had very few problems with my New Yorker since I bought it. I have had to replace a water pump in the cooling system, the radiator, and the brakes twice (mainly because I'm hard on brakes!). Other than that, it has always run like a dream.

As I mentioned above, my New Yorker is very safe to drive. It has excellent braking, good handling, a wide wheelbase and a low center a gravity so it never slips, even on wet pavement. Front wheel drive makes it handle better than most cars I've driven in the snow. (Very important in Indiana where I live.)

I have had my New Yorker for nearly four years now, and she's still running strong. I highly reccommend this make and model for its quality, reliability and safety.<br><br>
