            When my oldest started high school four years ago, I made my four boys, now aged 18, 16-year-old twins, and 14, a deal: If they kept their grades up, stayed out of trouble and did their best to save for school, I would do my best to buy each of them a car for their 18th birthday. I didn't promise them a Lexus, but I did promise them I would get them a car that would get them to their destination safely and reliably. My oldest passed through the magic gates of adulthood about a month ago, and, not being one to renege on a deal, I went with him to look at cars. 

For three weeks, we picked through every dealership in Central New York, and found almost nothing that would meet my son's self-imposed criteria of safety, reliability, fuel efficiency and value. 

Then, the five of us flew to Daytona Beach, FL, on a much needed vacation, and I realized upon our arrival that I had inadvertently signed us up for a compact rental car. At the rental desk, I panicked, wondering how I would fit myself, four (however lean) 6-foot-plus boys and our luggage in a subcompact car. I was reassured, however, when the lady at the rental desk said she'd seen much larger people fit into the Hyundai Elantra they were bringing around for us. 

The Elantra was a GLS 4-door sedan, a champagne color with a cloth interior pleasantly rendered in beige. I was pleasantly surprised when the five of us, and our luggage, fit comfortably into the small car. I was also pleased to note that there was a tremendous amount of room in the trunk for our vast array of paraphernalia. 

Driving down the freeway, I took note of the disciplined, almost lusty, noises coming from the 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, which pulled without protest despite the full load of people and luggage. I also noticed the smooth-shifting automatic transmission, compliant ride and handling, the full array of power conveniences - windows, locks and heated mirrors - as well as the supportive, multi-adjustable seats and the clear and complete instrumentation. The car was also equipped with a CD player, air conditioning, a power moonroof and keyless entry.

I was smitten. In fact, we all were, to the point of wondering if the rental car agency took a Corolla or Civic, pasted on the oval H logo and called it a Hyundai.

The price was also a shock: My youngest son, who was poking around in the back seat, produced the window sticker from the back seat magazine holder. Surprise! The sticker read just a hair over $15,000. To me, this represented unbeatable value for a car with front and side airbags, full power equipment, a sunroof, CD player and loads of interior space.

Overall, our four-day experience with the car was favorable. So favorable, that when we returned, my oldest son and I drove to the Hyundai dealership and were immediately taken with an Elantra hatchback - a GT model, deep blue with dark grey leather seats. However, the sticker read almost $16,000 -- a little dear for my wallet. However, upon hearing this, the salesman led us to the back of the showroom, where a 2002 GT hatchback sat priced at $9,500. The car had just a hair over 10,000 miles and still came with the balance of Hyundai's 10-year powertrain warranty and 60,000 mile bumper-to-bumper. Similar to the rental we had in Florida, this car had the moonroof, keyless entry, side air bags, plus the GT leather seats, anti-lock brakes and traction control. We paid just a little over $9,000, and after the exchange of money and paperwork, my son had his first car. 

I did indeed drive my son's car, the GT hatchback, and it was much the same as driving the rental in Florida, with a slightly firmer ride due to the different suspension tuning. The steering was precise, well-weighted, easy to manipulate and responsive, and the handling in general was very secure and buttoned-down -- very uncharacteristic of a small economy car. I found the brakes, four-wheel disc with ABS, to be very responsive as well -- no dead travel in the pedal and smooth, even modulation, producing consistent stopping power with little fade. In addition, although the hatchback is slightly heavier than the sedan, I noticed no deficit in power. Like the rental in Florida, I gave the front seats high marks in comfort, if a little slippery due to the leather upholstery. I did not try the back seats in the hatchback.

Despite the affection I hold for it, the Elantra does have its little irritations. For example, the wipers have only one intermittent setting -- a far cry from domestic wiper systems, with what seems like twenty intermittent settings. Also, it is a little difficult to see out the rear window in the inside rearview mirror -- a shortcoming common to most hatchbacks. However, the window does have its own wiper and washer system, a welcome convenience in the slushy CNY winter and spring. The door lock button on the passenger's side only unlocks the passenger door -- not all four doors like almost every other car on the planet. The trip computer, although a neat little device, only measures trip mileage and miles to empty, rather than actual mpg or fuel used like my Astro minivan. However, these are minor annoyances that detract little from the car's overall value and comfort.

My son has had the car for one month, and has already driven over 2,000 miles, mostly to and from his college and friends' colleges. He recently made a drive that took him and two of his friends through the mountains of Pennsylvania. He said that the car had no trouble keeping up with traffic, even on steep grades that left pickup trucks and SUV's languishing in the slow lanes. A fitting metaphor, then, for a car that leaves all its competitors in the dust.
