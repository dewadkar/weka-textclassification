              My 1996 Pontiac Sunfire is my first car. It�s so hot and sexy and it�s darned near perfect for a 42-year-old woman starting out on her own in this world.
  I�ve driven other cars, even owned other cars, but the Sunfire is MY FIRST CAR. Every other car I�ve owned has been selected for me by my ex, who made most of my choices for me, until the day I chose to live without him.
  For my birthday this year the government ordered me to smog my car, or DriveClean it as we say here in Ontario. This is a brand new programme for our province, and I guess it�s a good one, but I knew full-well this thing was going to turn out more like WalletClean than DriveClean.
   Before my car could even be monitored by the DriveClean equipment a mechanic advised me it needed a fair bit of work. My 1990 Dodge Shadow was leaking fuel, power steering fluid and possibly engine oil. It was starting to rust. I liked the car kind of mediocre okay, it was red and had a sunroof and a hatchback. It got me where I was going but shook at speeds over 100 K.
   I decided to buy a new car, new to me. My boyfriend laughed when he learned my greatest selection criteria was that my new car had to be red and hot, red and sexy. I like driving around with him in my Sunfire. He looks good in it. And I do too.
   I hope you will excuse my feeble attempt at reviewing cars. I�m no Roadiem. Sadly Roadiem passed away earlier this month. I didn�t know him well but I really liked his reviews, and he was so damned young. What a loss. 
This review is part of  a writeoff organized by Wolfman309. All proceeds from this writeoff will be forwarded to Roadiem�s family, in grateful appreciation for his friendships and contributions here. 
So on to my feeble review:
   The 1996 Pontiac Sunfire sporty, mine is two-door with a rear spoiler. The dark grey interior and tinted windows will make the car comfortably cool in the summer time. I have an odd selection of options. No ashtray (rough on us smokers), but a great AM FM radio system with a tape deck. Trouble is I hardly have any music on tape. I�m well-stocked in CDs. I don�t have power locks or windows, but I am getting used to winding up and down. The air conditioner works great, and during the arduous winter past, I became extremely impressed by this vehicle�s heating system. It�s absolutely yummy being warm while the world around me is freezing. That might sound like an odd point to some readers, but I�ve driven a lot of cars with inferior heating systems, and I like the Sunfire�s.
  For me, the biggest plus (aside from hot and red and red and sexy...... oh yeah I love that) is that the Sunfire is great on gas. I�m saving a bundle here, because I�m not driving a car with a leaky fuel line (duh!) but also because the Sunfire gets great mileage - about 500 km to a tank. With the price of gas, I�m really pleased about this attribute.
  I�m not so keen on the dual air bags. While my love and I look great booting about in the Sunfire, I should be putting my 10-year-old daughter in the back seat when I am alone in the car with her. An inflating air bag can seriously injure a small child, and even adults are cautioned to sit as far back as possible in their seats to avoid injury upon deployment of an airbag. I wish my car didn�t have them.
  I like that one key is used for the ignition, doors and all other locks. I�m making a mental note here to get a second key cut and give it to my neighbour. Having just one key is a dangerous thing in women like me who misplace things constantly. I do like the anti-theft features offered on the Sunfire, that there is a secret code protecting my radio system, and a secret code applied to the ignition. Without that code, even if I did accidently leave my keys in the car, no one can start her up and drive away. 
  It took some time getting used to the ABS (anti-lock brake system). I wasn�t used to the tug of the brakes on slippery road conditions, and had to learn not to pump my brakes on a slide, rather to let the ABS do the work for me. Having adjusted my driving habits, I quite like the ABS.
  My old Shadow had odd headlights. I was very uncomfortable on night driving, because I didn�t have sufficient lumination. The Sunfire is perfect. I love the red lights in the instrument panel (so hot, so hot), and the exterior lights provide a beautifully lit roadway for me. In general, the car drives smoothly, and feels weighty - as if I really have a machine surrounding me. My old car felt like a tin can. The Sunfire has guts and I have  a heavy foot, but in the three months I�ve owned it I�ve been quite good about keeping my speed under control. I did test her out one day and she drives well at 140 km/hr, with no hesitations or shakes.
  Obviously, I�m mechanically inept, and have exhausted my knowledge about my car. I do know it runs like a dream, gives me no trouble, and gives me pleasure.
  I paid just over $4,000 (US) which is the most money I�ve ever spent on a car. What the hell, it�s hot and sexy, and so am I.
  Here�s to hot cars and Roadiem.
