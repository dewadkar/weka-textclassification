            If you want a vehicle that you're going to have to replace a transmission in even before you've completely paid off you loan, then choose a Chrysler product.  This is the second automobile, first by Pontiac, that has had a transmission go out too soon.  Not even 5 years and the damn thing is dead and I've still got some payments left to go.  I've babied this thing and it'll cost almost $2000 to replace the transmission.  I called Chrysler and they said they couldn't help me because the warranty is out of date.  If you search the net you'll see alot of problems with Chrysler transmissions, so let the buyer beware.  I have a 89 Toyota truck with a lot more miles and the transmission is great and I treat it like a truck so next time I buy a vehicle, it definitely won't be a Chrysler lemon.
