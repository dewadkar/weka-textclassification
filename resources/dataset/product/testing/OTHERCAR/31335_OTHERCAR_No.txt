             My parents bought this car back in 1994, retiring the family's beloved 1984 Buick Electra. My mom wanted to buy another Buick product, but my dad won out, as the Chrysler LHS car already had 8,000 miles on it - thusly cheaper. Plus, both cars were roomy, comfortable, and shared the same deep red color. Maybe my dad thought we wouldn't notice the Electra was gone.

 I hope my father is kicking himself now. We should have known why the car was so well-discounted. 

 The moral of this story is that you should only consider the LHS if you want a closer, friendlier relationship with one's mechanic. 

 Two days after the LHS came into my parents' ownership, the problems began. On a two and-a-half hour road trip, my mom had trouble setting the cruise control.  Two weeks after my parents bought the car, my mom nearly hit a pedestrian in a Taco Bell parking lot. Her brights weren't working in the stereotypically dark and stormy night. She brought the car into the local Chrysler dealership, who never fixed this &quot;minor&quot; oversight. 

 Being inspected has been our LHS's occupation since we've purchased it. See, the problems kept on coming, one after the other: the air conditioner died in 1996, flooding the floors of the car with fluid. It hasn't worked since, making being in the car in temperatures of 80 or above very uncomfortable.  The heat also is very unresponsive, making being in the car in bitter temperatures a miserable experience. 

 Of course, six years, many unprintable nicknames, and a change of ownership later, the problems haven't ceased. The steering wheel bucked and protested at speeds of 65 mph or above this summer, making keeping your hands on the wheel very difficult when it's most important. 

 The problem du jour is the transmission. Now that winter's arrived in the Midwest, the car must heat up for up to 15 minutes if I want to back out of my parking spot. The LHS also refuses to be put into drive if it so chooses. 

 I would take it into the shop, but I'd rather just make my LHS disappear. <br><br>
