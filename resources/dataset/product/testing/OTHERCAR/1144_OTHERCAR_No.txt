            I purchased a 2000 Neon ES in March 1999 (I believe right after they came out). This was my first Dodge and I was immediately impressed with the handling and interior roominess of this compact car. My car that I traded in was a 1989 Pontiac Sunbird and was very dependable until the engine blew up after 10 good years. After driving the Neon I immediately fell in love with it. It had a lot of &quot;spunk&quot; and accelerated nicely. 

My problems started at about 800 miles. I had the security package with the keyless remote. The button to release the trunk would unlock the trunk and then relock it before you could open it. The trunk never actually popped open like I thought it should. I also noticed that the brakes were extremely squeaky when braking on an incline. I of course scheduled an appointment with the service department and was told that the trunk lid is very light and that there was nothing they could do about it. I would just need two hands to open the trunk. The brakes on the Neon they said get a light coating of rust when they sit overnight and the noise came from the rust wearing off. When I explained that they weren't just noisy in the morning, he didn't have an answer.

Since that first visit, my Neon has gone to the shop 11 TIMES during the past year. Various problems have arisen including noisy steering that the service manager said they were finding with the 2000 Neon. The power steering pump was replaced to fix that problem. 

The strap on the driver door that attaches the door to the car broke and when they had it in the shop to fix that they tore the upholstery and had to replace the whole interior door panel. 

At about 1,500 miles, the engine light came on and the air-conditioning quit. For this problem they kept the car 1 week and had to replace a low pressure switch in it (luckily I did get a loaner car). 

Then the power window on the passenger side would not go down and it took them three weeks to get the part in to fix it. I also have a vibration that sounds like a shield rattling under the car at lower speeds that they cannot fix. 

If that's not enough, they also can't fix the windshield washer fluid so that it sprays on the entire windshield, not just the passenger side. Doesn't do the driver a whole lot of good. This they say cannot be adjusted. I simply asked them if there was anything on this car that could be fixed??! The vibration under the car is still there and can sometimes be heard over the radio.

Needless to say, after one year of headaches I have just traded in this car for a nice dependable Ford Explorer. This was one dream that turned into a nightmare! The 2000 Neon has several strong points such as a smooth ride for a compact car, lots of front leg room, a cute body style, and I thought that the seats were extremely comfortable. Unfortunately this car cannot be considered a lemon because it's been in for various problems, not just one in particular. Buyer beware!!!
