            Having just returned from another day of amazement at the dealership and while most of the facts are still fuzzy in my mind, oops I mean clear, I thought I would treat the epinion seekers to a an S/V 40 walk and drive.

Europe 1996 was the test bed for the car which came to the US as a 2000 model.  The first examples of this model were low priced (for Volvo) and were well equipped even in the base model.  

Eye appeal is in the eye of the beholder and I like the   overall appearance of the car, with the exception of the  plastic ground effects and the 8 spoke alloy wheels.  The newest 2001 models are starting to show up with a very nice multi-spoke wheel that is a noticeable improvement in appearance but wait and see about the bumps and lumps details, which is to say how will it handle the pot holes rough pounding.

Volvo gets an &quot;A+&quot; for the utilization of interior space for this car because it is not a big compact but it has a big compact interior, 100 cubic feet.  We just received the S60 (2001 replacement for the S70) and the interior of the S40 is larger, especially the rear passenger seating.  There is easily room enough for a 6 1/2 foot passenger in an S40 but the S60 will barely carry someone 5' 10&quot;.

The controls are as you would expect from Volvo nothing too centrally located but spread around giving the driver the impression that there are lots  of features.  Features that should be standard in this price category are optional such as, front fog lights, power seat, high quality sound system, trip computer, and a 5 speed transmission is not available at any price.

Touchy feely:  The doors feel solid except for the hood and that kind of reminds me of the earlier Nissan Pulsar hoods but there is no manual prop rod so Volvo gets out of that jam. Interior coverings in the base model are very neutral almost like they didn't want to make any dogs angry, so if you are Human go buy yourself a couple of Recaro seats.  The coverings and controls are simple and have that grippy cushion over hard plastic feel and this is ok unless you tend to claw things cause that covering stuff peels off easy.

Start the car and the engine's note is pleasant with a hint of &quot;When you need me I'll be there&quot;, and it does respond well.  This 1.9 litre turbo offers impressive punch and civil feedback.  For those who are shifty, there is no geartronic  offering, too bad.  This car feels heavier on the road than its actual 2767 pound curb weight suggests and thanks to the people at Mitsubishi for this.  The S40 is a very confident road car at speeds under 80 mph and the efficiency of its engine/5 speed auto work well to keep you passing the pumps.

From an up-keep perspective this car has been very cost effective and we see very few problems so far, but I do wonder if there is a conspiracy with the tire companies  as even these cars tend to eat the tires sooner than I'd like.  You can expect about 35,000 normal driving miles out of a set.  

What price safety?  This car is a four star rated sedan and has performed at the top of its class and offers side bags, curtains and both frontal dual stage airbags.  The DSA, Dynamic Stability Control and anti-locking brake systems are also great contributors to safety.

For those who want it all in a compact this is a good bet.  I did some shopping and for a loaded S40 you will pay around $28,875.00 with metallic paint.  For my dollar I priced out a Jetta GLS 1.8t with actually a few more options than the S40 and came up with a suggested retail of  $22,145.00.  I have yet to drive one so I'll get back to you.<br><br>
