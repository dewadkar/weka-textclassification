            Given the credentials of the brand, expectations set on this rather massive piece of automotive machinery are rather high, and the Cayenne pretty much meets them. Provided that owning an SUV ranks at the highest of your car choice criteria.

Before getting inside, a quick look outside. By european standards, this is a rather big car. Esthetics are up to personnal taste, I tend not to like it much. From about any angle.
The interior design and finish are nice and classy though, not Audi-class (which I consider best in the industry), but very close. 

Once on the road, engine noise is addictive, tends to make you work the engine at higher revs than it actually needs to, just for the fun of it. The automatic gearbox works well, upshifts and downshifts are seamless. The tiptronic feature proves, as usual on good automatic gearboxes, almost irrelevant, you're better off letting the box do its work on its own 95% of the time.

I drove the car with winter tires on a cold day so I could not comment on ultimate cornering abilities, I experienced noticeable understeer when pushing limits, but body roll is well contained. Braking seems convincing.

I did not measure gas consumption precisely but I'd expect 20L/100km, substantially more if you floor the throttle.

Unless you live in a remote area and really plan off-road use, you may really question the relevance of the car as a whole. Compared to, say, an Audi S6, there is probably less shoulder and leg space at the rear, boot volume is not usefully bigger neither. For a fraction of the gas consumption (and the purchase price), you'll have a car way easier to park, much more discrete, and which will handle better while retaining the active safety of four wheel drive.

I have not had the opportunity to try the Turbo version, performance is very likely to be impressive, even my 'normal' supercar standards, but one may wonder about the pertinence of such a car.
