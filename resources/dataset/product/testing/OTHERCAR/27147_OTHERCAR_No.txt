            I own a transportation company that uses a variety of vans. FORD and DODGE are the 2 makes I have utilized. I have owned 8 Dodges (Grand Caravan, 10 Passenger &amp; 15 Passenger) Every single one of them has had major problems with the transmissions and air conditioners and paint jobs, as well as a host of minor problems.  

The front and rear air even when working correctly never cools enough for here in Florida on the Dodges, (the Ford is icy cold and better output design) The suspension in these vans is terrible compared to the Fords, the suspension is a trucks and it sure rides like one. I tell the passengers in the back seat to hang on if we go over a sizable bump as they will go flying and hit their head.  (The kids love it though) The interior amenities are poorly designed, hard to reach, and fall apart.  

The front end had continuous suspension problems resulting in premature wear of tires.  And why in the world they want to put armrests on a van that is used for transport of lots of people (church bus, school groups, airport limos) It makes entry and exit difficult and eventually the arms get torn off resulting in usightly seat tears that are very expensive to repair.

I have noticed nearly all the transportation companies in Orlando have switched to the Ford Vans (literally thousands of these vans are in Mouse town) Every mechanic I have dealt with has told me what a dog these transmissions are (I just had to put the 3rd one on a 1994 van that has 108,000 miles on it. RIDICULOUS!!!  I had been trying to sell it when the last transmission that had 20,000 miles on it failed. And I have talked to lots of other companies that have these vehicles with virtually the same story.  I WILL NEVER buy another Dodge product, and I would not recommend it to anyone. Even though the engine is solid, after you have shelled out thousands on big ticket repairs of transmissions and AC's it is not worth it.<br><br>
