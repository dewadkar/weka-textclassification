            In early 1998, we were in the market for our first new car.  Of the selections on the market, we were captivated by a stunning new car on the Chrysler lot...the new Concorde.

With front styling reminiscent of early Jaguars, a swoopy greenhouse and a rakishly swept roofline, the Concorde was a styling coup for Chrysler.  Along with the Mercury Sable and Oldsmobile Intrigue, we test drove a Concorde LX, which hasn't changed substantially from then until now.  Of the cars on this platform -- Concorde, Intrepid, 300M -- the Concorde is the one tuned primarily for comfort.

Inside the Concorde, we were greeted with acres and acres of space.  My wife and I had room to stretch out and take a nap in the front seats, which were a good combination of soft, yet supportive.  The front chairs were lacking in side bolstering...but in keeping with this car's focus, it's not really necessary.

In the rear, there is decidedly enough room for adults to be comfortable.  With my seat all the way back, the salesman still had leftover space to put his feet and legs, and behind my 5' tall wife's seat there had to have been enough space to set up a toy train set.  

The Concorde comes with a high level of standard equipment for the $22,145 base MSRP.  Power steering, brakes, windows, mirrors and driver's seat are standard, as is cruise control, tilt steering, remote entry, AM/FM cassette, trunk cargo net and 4-wheel disc brakes.  ABS is an option though, and one that should be standard to compete with other cars in the Concorde's bracket.  Ashtrays are also an option, and I applaud that decision by Chrysler, because it would make it easier to keep my in-laws from begging to smoke in my car and stink it all up. 

The standard engine in the Concorde is a 2.7 liter, 200 horsepower V6, mated to a 4-speed automatic transmission.  While the car isn't spritely, neither is it a slug under acceleration, moving its 3400 lbs. to 60 miles per hour in 9.5 seconds, according to Edmunds.com.  I can attest to the same...while the base engine gets the job done, its small displacement is revealed by the high RPM's needed to produce peak power -- 5800 RPM to reach peak horsepower, and 4850 RPM for peak torque.  

While these engine speeds are fine for racing, they're very high for a car that will probably spend much of its time in town waiting to take off from stoplights, where the order of the day is torque waiting in the basement, and lots of it to satisfy American right feet.

All of that aside, the Concorde actually has very nice road manners.  Ride quality is well damped and smooth, without the &quot;floatiness&quot; found in many large American cars.  In the time we drove it, combining some city driving with a short stint on the freeway, the car remained composed the whole time.  Handling could best be described as &quot;stable.&quot;  While not a driver's car that begs to be cornered hard like a BMW, the Concorde does inspire confidence in its abilities.  In fast sweeping turns, it doesn't say &quot;toss me&quot; as much as &quot;if that's what you want to do, okay then.&quot;  

Where this car becomes more of a handful is in the parking lot.  The gorgeous, flowing bodywork disappears from the driver's view and becomes a handicap when trying to judge the distance to the curb or to another car, as there is absolutely no frame of reference.  

As an example, when the salesman was pulling the car out of its parking spot on the lot, he had to work around another customer's vehicle which was partially blocking it in.  At one point he hung his head out the window and asked us how how close he was to the car next to him; he was sure that he was about to hit it if he went another inch...and there was enough room in front of the Concorde for an adult to walk through.

That, and the unspoken concern that buying a Chrysler product is buying a season ticket to the service dept. are the only objective downsides to the Concorde that we could see.  The reason we didn't get the car is that it just didn't fit our personality.  To me it feels like a car for people who desire high style and comfort over sheer performance, but aren't yet ready to give up an occasional spirited drive.<br><br>
