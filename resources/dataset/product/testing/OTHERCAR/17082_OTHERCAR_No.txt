            Mercedes-Benz is a legendary name in the auto industry, renowned for its exceptional quality and engineering, but does that mean the three-pointed star is immune to rolling out an occasional lemon? Is it possible for Mercedes-Benz to build a clunker?

Yes Virginia, M-B is indeed capable of building a clunker. We know because we own one. We leased a new 1999 ML 320 in October, 1998 and were immediately surprised by some very un-Mercedes-like rattles, squeaks and shakes. The ML felt much looser than our other sport utility vehicle, a 1997 Jeep Grand Cherokee. This came as something of a shock, considering how often Mercedes is praised in the car magazines for its solid body structure and �vault-like� feel.

After about a month, the rattles, squeaks and shakes were joined by a rushing wind noise from the rear hatch�which grew steadily in intensity over the next few weeks until the interior of our vehicle at highway speeds sounded like a 747 blasting down the runway at full thrust. Another surprise awaited us at the car wash, where the rear cargo compartment got thoroughly soaked because of the poor seal around the hatch door. Good thing we weren't shlepping any groceries back there at the time; I don't have anything against wax beans, but I'm not sure how tasty Carnuba'd veggies might be.

When we took the ML to the dealer to look at the problem, the service manager pointed out that the hatch door was sticking up about an inch above the roofline. �Has the vehicle been in a crash?� he asked, adding that he had never seen such a badly misaligned door that wasn�t the result of a collision. The dealer replaced the weather stripping around the hatch and realigned the door, which fixed the problem�temporarily. The wind noise returned several months later. 

We were perplexed by the poor quality of our vehicle, but never having owned a Mercedes before, we didn't know if the rattling was something that plagued all MLs or just ours. Then we drove the dealer�s ML 320 loaner while ours was in the shop for the first of what would be many, many extended visits. We were astounded that the loaner had none of the shakes and rattles of our own vehicle, displaying the kind of surefooted composure one would expect in a Mercedes. The difference was night and day. I should point out here that the loaner ML was the so-called Elegance version, which includes leather upholstery, a sunroof and other amenities, while our ML is the less expensive, Classic version, with cloth seats and no sunroof. Mechanically however, the two versions are identical.

We subsequently drove yet another dealer-owned ML 320 Elegance, which was also rattle-free. Why then did our ML rattle and squeak like a bad accordion in an oompah band? We concluded that our vehicle somehow slipped off M-B�s new assembly line in Tuscaloosa, Alabama without anyone catching the defect. It happens. Any assembly line produces its share of defects and rejects. When you consider that M-B was still working out the kinks in a brand new factory at the time our vehicle was built�not to mention struggling to keep up with the surging demand for the M series�it�s not inconceivable that one shoddy specimen slipped through. 

But you will never get Mercedes-Benz to admit that. A regional service manager sent to inspect our car concluded that the rattling was caused by defective door hinge hardware, which was replaced under warranty. The doors no longer rattle, but the rest of the body still does. The vehicle shudders violently when going over even modest potholes or bumps. The passenger side window now squeaks constantly and the dashboard shakes like Ricky Martin in La Vida Loca. 

Another problem has been with the �check engine� light, which stayed illuminated for about six months while the dealer tried, and failed, repeatedly, to fix the engine sensor problem that caused the light to go on in the first place. It was finally fixed after about four or five trips to the dealer. (We almost miss the warm, amber glow of the �check engine� light that has been our constant driving companion all these months.) Oh, and did I mention that one of the headlamps burned out after less than 40,000 kilometers (about 25,000 miles)?

So naturally Mercedes-Benz, keeper of the quality faith, immediately sent a team of experts to examine our vehicle in microscopic detail, in order to learn how such an aberration could possibly have passed out the factory gate, right? Um, no. The idea that Mercedes is somehow more genuinely concerned about quality than other corporations is a fantasy that we gullible folk in consumerland have been conditioned to believe by all the company�s glossy advertising and careful cultivation of its brand cachet. 

The reality is that Mercedes-Benz is an arrogant corporation that doesn�t care any more about its customers than any other car company, which is to say it is happy to sell you a car, but if you have a problem, don�t expect them to make it right. Of course, the special treat in dealing with Mercedes is that its employees have perfected the technique of looking down their noses at us hoi-polloi arrivistes, who, now that the company has brought in reasonably-priced vehicles, are able to join the ranks of Mercedes owners for the first time. The attitude you get at the dealer is: �So, you�re one of the plebeians who can now afford our new, cheap Mercedes, eh? Just don�t expect us to treat you with the same dignity we extend to our genteel clients who buy our elegant $100,000 cars.�

Yes, Mercedes did offer a solution to our problem vehicle: �We�ll be happy to lease you a new car,� they said. Of course, they insist on making a killing in the process. When we pointed out that we feel cheated after paying full price for a defective vehicle, they said they would be happy to fix it, but not replace it. We now look forward to making a few dozen more trips to the dealer. Maybe they wouldn�t mind if I pitched a tent and sleeping bag in their showroom, seeing as I spend so much time there, it would just be so much more practical than commuting back and forth every day.

All in all, Mercedes-Benz has some major work to do if it intends to compete effectively in the mid-priced segment it is now pursuing with vehicles like the M series. The company�s strategy of making its vehicles more affordable, and thereby reaching a broader market�the new CLK midsize coupe, and even the new flagship S series sedans cost thousands less than their immediate predecessors�will not work if M-B waters down the quality of its vehicles and the attentiveness of its service. People who pay a premium for the three-pointed star don�t want to be treated like second-class citizens because they can finally afford to buy a moderately priced Mercedes-Benz. 

Most of all, buyers who are attracted to the mythical Mercedes brand should keep in mind that with today�s Mercedes-Benz, there is no guarantee of avoiding a clunker.
