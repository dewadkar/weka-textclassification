            I own a 99 Chev Tahoe. It's 2 doors and is fully loaded. The color is charcoal grey with bigger tires. This could be one of the greatest vehicles ever made. I feel that it is most deffinitely the best sport utility on the market. It has a smoothe ride with an enormous amount of power. The v-8 engine just makes the Tahoe that much better because the accelleration is unbelievable! My brother has an explorer and it is like a baby car compared to the tahoe. 

The things you get when buying a tahoe are fantastic. The leather is great, the seats are comfortable, and the room in this is enormous! It can tow just about anything at any weight. You can add all kinds of accessories like a grill or anything of that sort to totally make it look awesome. I totally recommend looking into buying the tahoe and especially the 2-door one.
