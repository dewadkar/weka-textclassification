              I purchased this car with my family 7 years ago. Ever since then, it has worked great for the most part. It rides smoothly and we have never had to take the car to the garage, except for regular expections and such. We have about 150,000 miles on the car. It has many special features like power windows, power lock doors, the usual stuff. The only thing that I don't like about it is that it makes you feel kind of stuffy because it doesn't have a lot of window space. The power doors down work all the time any more. Some times the passenger's door doesn't unlock from the outside, sometimes that happens with the front door too. It sounds like this car is terrible, but because I know nothing about the technical names of the car parts, I can't really describe the car that well. The car works well and I runs and drives smoothly. I like this car a lot, but it might not be the car for everyone. You should always go the the car's website first, check magazines like "Consumer Reports", and check dealers prices. Good luck!
