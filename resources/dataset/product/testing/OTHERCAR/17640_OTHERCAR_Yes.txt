            Ever since I bought my first Saturn back in 1994 I have always been impressed with the car and the company.  First, when you get to the lot you aren't hasseled as soon as you step out of the car.  The reason you aren't hasseled is because they know they put out a good product and they have a no haggle price.  The only thing you can haggle with is your trade in.  

Lets get to the car.  First, let me tell you right off the bat, that this car is NOT a sports car.  The little 4 cylinder car they give you can barely muster the 100 horsepower allotted to you and the get up and go could be compared to my motor driven lawn mower.

Yet why is it a good car?  Low maintenance, high reliability, great gas mileage and it sure is pretty to look at.  The price isn't too bad either.  The car handles really well around the corners and the cars absorbs the bumps real well.  The extra door comes in pretty handy too.  If this car is decked out with real nice rims and a sunroof your heart will melt.

You know how you get a new car and when you get out of it you are constantly looking back at it?  Why do you do that?  To make sure it is still there?  NO!  Because it is beautiful.  So if you buy this car be prepared for the kinked neck because you are constantly going to be looking back.<br><br>
