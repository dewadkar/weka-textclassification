               We've had two of these in a row.  They are dependable.  In the eight years that we had the two, we had absolutely no problems.  the improvements madd on the 98 model include better control at slower speeds.  Because of its size it is harder to get responsive handling at slow speeds.  Chevy did a good job of fixing this up so that parking lots were no longer a twenty minute maze. 
     There is also a hint that they are trying to make this into a more luxurious vehicle.  With the new on-road suv's out you can expect a good deal on one of these.  I must say it came in handy for those days out on the course with all of the family, or sports games.  Days at the beach are not a problem anymore.  Because of the space inside this truck you get a sufficient area for seating and storage.  
     Expect a slightly rough ride also.  The engine provides plenty of power, and this thing tows great.  You are making a great investment with this truck.  Do what you want when you want to.<br><br>
