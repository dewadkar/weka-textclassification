            This car was a replacement for my first car (94 Honda del Sol VTEC) which got totaled by an uninsured punk who ran a red light driving some old 60s clunker.  But I digress...

I can't say I've ever thought much of Neon in the past.  I wasn't, (and to a large degree still am not) a fan of american cars.  But I've always valued cars that are different.  While I've always respected cars like the Civic and the Corolla for their reliability, I've never owned either (Well ok, the del Sol is based on the Civic platform in the vaguest sense.) because I always wanted to drive a car that was different from the cars that everybody else was driving.  That's where Neon came in.

I discovered Neon in the form of the rental car that I was driving after the accident.  I wasn't aware that DaimlerChrysler had redesigned the car until that point, and I was quite surprised by the sheer size of this red car I was to drive for a while.

While shopping for a replacement for the del Sol, I considered many vehicles.  In the end, what attracted me to the Neon was it's roominess, comfort, and acceleration.  Let's take a look at individual aspects of Neon


RIDE AND HANDLING: Neon doesn't quite accelerate like a VTEC del Sol does.  Then again, a VTEC del Sol weighs around 2200lbs, and has 160HP under the hood.  Neon weighs 2600lbs and has 132HP.  Still, I found the acceleration to be above adequate for all situations.  It would be even better with a 4Spd. Automatic though.  The Neon handles itself incredibly well in corners, (I opted for the 15" alloy wheels, the standard 14" ones may yield worse results.)The turning radius in the car is somewhat large for the car's size.  While present, road noise has been considerably dimmed from that of the previous generation Neon.  Ride quality is incredibly smooth.

EXTERIOR: I love the styling of the Neon.  It sets itself apart from the other compact cars on the market, without being overly flamboyant like the Ford Focus.  The 15" alloy wheels look incredible.  Unlike the rental car I had, the car I bought was a deep metallic blue called Patriot Blue by Dodge.

INTERIOR: Put simply, this car has more interior room than that of some older generation Accords I've been in.  Front and Rear occupants get plenty of stretching room.  And the leather seats that I opted for look great, and are incredibly comfortable.  The driver display is just too cool.  It's one of those new off-white style ones, where during the day, the numbers and letters are black on a white background, but at night they become neon blue with red needles.  The one quirky thing here is that the power windows are only available on the two front doors, rear doors get manual cranks.  All Neons come with the same sound system regardless of trim level.  A six-speaker AM/FM w/ Cass number that just sounds incredible.  Add to that the 6-disc CD changer that the dealer threw in for free, and it's an incredible value.

VALUE: Wow, I never thought someone could get this much car for so little.  The sticker price for the Neon ES was 17,500.  After negotiating the price down to around 17,000, a $1500 rebate and the free $500 CD changer package brought the price down to $15,000.  And for my $15,000 I got:

-Leather Seating w/ Side Impact Air Bags
-Air Conditioning
-6 Speaker Sound System w/ AM/FM Cass and 6Disc CD Changer
-Power Sunroof
-Fog Lights
-15" Alloy wheels
-Sentry Key Security System
-Power Windows (Albeit only up front)
-Power Door Locks
-Simulated Woodgrain Finish on dash, gearshift selector, and door spears
-2 years of free scheduled maintenance interior and exterior

And too many other standard features to list.
