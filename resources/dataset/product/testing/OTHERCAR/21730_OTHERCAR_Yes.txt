            My 1991 Probe was totalled by one of those idiots we all come across in life-you know,the ones that can't drive? So with my settlement I began looking for newer,more dependable car that wouldn't break me at the same time. I went to a Chevrolet dealership where my parents and family have been buying cars for years&lt;my sister and mom also own this car&gt;. I said I was looking for a 4 door with a cd player,and it had to be purple. They showed me the 1998 cavalier and I knew it was what I wanted,so we began the paperwork. The car itself has been very reliable,all my complaints are with the dealership,who promised longer warranties than they came through with. They were very rude when I wanted my vent fixed,and refused to replace it. Needless to say I will never return there,and although I recommend this car to everyone,I'm very specific when I tell them what Chevrolet dealers to pass up!My note is 250.00 dollars,very reasonable. I've never had any major problems out of this car,replaced the battery and brakes,normal maintenance with any car. It drives great,picks up speed quick,and I love the style of these cars. The insurance is very reasonable as well. The car is sporty enough for my young age,but still a family car with plenty of room for my son.<br><br>
