            Got Cat Style?  You could, if you join the Mercury Cougar club.  I joined last year and I'm delighted with my '99 V6 MTX Cougar.  Needing a replacement for my '92 Mazda MX3, I found the perfect successor in this affordable, powerful (160 HP), great looking cat...I mean car.  An assortment of exterior and interior Cubist circles and triangles adds pizzazz to a vehicle that gets 26.5 MPG, four adults in molded/quasi-bucket seats, lots of shopping bags in a suprisingly spacious trunk, and lots of admiring looks.  Did I mention it's a blast to drive?  All this for an amazing $16,895 base price, plus about $2,000 in extras, since I was such a good boy during the year.  Drawbacks?  The Cubist motif is a negative when applied to outside rear-view mirrors that even (a dead) Picasso would agree seems to make the blind-spot larger than normal.  And I've had some gremlins with my sunroof, but that has been dealt with, and is the only problem I've experienced in 21,600 miles.  People still seem to have a hard time identifying the Cougar, such as the valet parking attendant who wrote &quot;Jaguar negro&quot; on my receipt.  I take that as a positive.  I like standing out from the crowd, being unusual.  That's why I'm a state employee...    <br><br>
