            This is the greatest toy we have ever owned. It is fun in Winter (thanks to heated seats) and Summer (thanks to AC).
I say a toy because it holds exactly 2 passengers, no pretense of a third.
I say a toy because when you go to to the supermarket, you have to get plastic bags instead of paper. The paper bags are too tall for the trunk.
I say a toy because on the open road it it a pure joy to drive and ride in.
This toy goes like a bat out of Hell.
Great traction control which is needed with the torque provided by the excellent and quiet 6 cylinder engine.
In fact, terrific low-end torque.
I love this toy.<br><br>
