            I have been driving my Suzuki XL7 for 6 weeks now, and I must say I am very impressed with it. For the money this is one heck of a Car with rear air conditioning, 16-inch aluminum wheels, and an AM/FM stereo system that includes an in-dash CD player. Safety isn�t overlooked either with anti-lock brakes, fog lamps, and anti-intrusion bars in the doors. 
I have the Automatic version with 4 Wheel Drive. I picked the XL7 mainly because I wanted a �Proper� 4WD with low/high Range and a separate chassis. I also looked at the Honda and the Mazda, but their 4WD SUVs are basically built for the suburbs rather than the rougher roads. Don�t get me wrong, performance on the Highway is just as important to me as efficiency on the rough stuff. The XL7 handles the Highway as well as a standard sedan , its V6 engine gives plenty of smooth power and the separate chassis ensures a quiet and smooth ride. Basically this SUV is the best compromise between a rugged SUV and a Sedan that I have ever come across. 
Any problem areas? At this stage not really, the luggage area is quite small with all the seats up, but I guess if you have 7 people on board you can�t expect a lot of room to be left over. 
Suzuki have come up with a nice all-round SUV that feels tough and reliable, if you want a �Proper� 4WD without buying a Full Size SUV you should check it out..
If you think that you may have read this review peviously, that's because I mistakenly submitted it for the 2001 Model:)
