            This is the first new car I've purchased and is the best car I've owned. I would recommend a Passat to anyone who values performance, handling, and German engineering. The Passat does not isolate you from the road like some of the other sedans I test drove. It demands to be driven and just gets better the harder you drive it. 

I initially went to the VW dealer to purchase a Jetta but after a test drive I realized it just wasn't large enough. I purchased the car in November of '94 and the dealer was willing to deal on the Passat. So I drove a black model and fell in love with it. Yet, the longer I own this car the more I respect it. 

But be advised that the upkeep on this car can be expensive if you've never owned a German car. Basic maintenance just seems to cost more than you might expect. But it's worth every penny. 

I've heard that the newer 1999 and 2000 Passats have been toned down a bit to complete more with the Accords and Camry's. I hope this is not the case because the edginess is what gives the Passat its personality. 

Overall this is great car.
