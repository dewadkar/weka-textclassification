            Typically Hyundai has not been synonymous with quality, or even value for that matter.  Even the harshest critic would have to admit that Hyundai is trying.  With products such as the Sonata, XG300  and the Santa Fe, Hyundai is looking more and more like a young Toyota.  It wasn�t that long ago that Toyota had only the Tercel, Corolla, Celica, Camry, Cressida,and a truck to offer as its full line-up.  The real question is, will Hyundai be able to match companies like Toyota for quality and durability?  Ask Hyundai and they�ll tell you yes, in fact they are putting one of the best warranties in the world behind each product just to show you how confident they are.

The Santa Fe looks different, it seems wider than other mini SUVs.  Styling seems to be borrowed from both the RAV-4 and the new Mitsubishi Montero.  The Santa Fe�s looks much larger up close than in magazine or Internet pictures.  Santa Fe gives you more useable space and cargo room than Honda CRV, Chevrolet Tracker, and the Toyota RAV-4.

Inside the Santa Fe there is the familiar plastic smell.  Some car companies �new car smell� smells better than others, Hyundai smells cheap.  Yet the materials seem to have a quality feel to them.  From the driver�s seat, dashboard and gauges look more Mazda or Nissan than Hyundai or Kia. An electro-chromatic mirror is standard on Buicks and Cadillacs � but a Hyundai?  The self dimming mirror makes you wonder how you ever got along without it. Tilt steering wheel is standard on all Santa Fe models.  A/C and heat controls are well placed and easy to use, although the A/C on-off switch is rather small. Controls for the stereo system seem a bit dated in their arrangement, but the sound quality is above average for a stock stereo.  Power door locks and power outside mirrors are a nice feature, but controls for these functions are oddly placed on the driver side door.  Once the driver gets use to the placement of these buttons, he/she will find that the actual operation is much more intuitive than many other nicer, and more expensive cars.

Seats are comfortable and supportive offering many different knobs and levers to make the seating position EXACTLY to ones liking.  Cloth seats on the GLS model are somewhat more comfortable than the leather which comes on the LX. Sometimes less is more.

Storage room is plentiful.  An optional rack allows two large mountain bikes to be carried inside � the sacrifice is rear passenger seating, two people, two bikes � that�s it. The 60/40 split rear seat is easy to use. Reclining rear seats make long trips a possibility for 4 (and some luggage). Rear passenger leg room is adequate.  Once inside the Santa Fe, it�s obvious how much bigger it is than CRV and others in its class.

On the road the Santa Fe rides high, and feels wide. Overall ride quality is more on par with what most have come to expect from Honda rather than Hyundai. Acceleration will not win any races, and is barely adequate (but it is adequate).  You�d think a 181 horsepower, 2.7L V-6  would feel�., well more powerful.  The automatic transmission comes with a shift-it-yourself �shiftronic� mode which  is standard on both GLS and LX models (base model comes with a manual and  149 hp, 4-cylinder).  The automatic up shifts feel a little soft even under full throttle.  Noticeable body roll when cornering remind you that the Santa Fe is no sports car, but may be better suited for off-road duty than many other small SUVs. Brakes are adequate. Amazing is the only way to describe the ride on the open highway. There is little road noise, and even less hum from the decidedly non-aggressive tires.  Other comments included; Smooth, quiet, solid, and �This is a Hyundai?�

When shopping for a small SUV, don�t leave the Santa Fe off your list.  However, leave the more expensive LX off the list.  LX features add leather, chrome door handles and stainless steel scuff panels.  The GLS is the real bargain, and the Utility package is worth serious consideration, adding items such as heated outside mirrors, cargo net, first aid kit, keyless entry, you�d be hard pressed not to compare the Santa Fe with the X-terra.

Overall the Hyundai Santa Fe is a surprisingly competent mini-SUV.  Quality has been an  issue with Hyundai cars of the past, but  a 5 year / 60,000 mile unlimited bumper to bumper warranty, plus a 10 year / 100,000 mile power train warranty combined with 5 years of 24 roadside assistance should alleviate some fears.  If you are considering a Hyundai, you might want to act soon, it is inconceivable that Hyundai will be able to offer this warranty forever.

Compare the Hyundai Santa Fe to:

Toyota RAV 4 � A little smaller but Toyota Quality
Nissan X-terra � Better looking
Honda CRV- Smaller, not up to Honda standards
Ford Escape/Mazda Tribute - Similar
Subaru Forester
Kia Sportage � Quality??
Isuzu Rodeo � Looks a little dated

On the down side, many Hyundai dealers seem to employ a fast-talking, high-pressure sales tactic.  It will probably scare most people off�  right into the Saturn dealership.
