            I love my JEEP...  The ride and the feeling of safety is beyond words.

After test driving several sport utility vehicles, I finally settled on a &quot;Jeep Grand Cherokee&quot; one year ago. Living in Western Canada we normally have severe winter weather conditions, lots of snow and icy roads therefore it is almost a must to have a four wheel drive Vehicle.  

Last year and so far this year there has been no need &quot;YET&quot; for a 4 wheel drive as our weather patterns have changed for the better with record highs in our temperatures. The JEEP's ride is comfortable, it is easy to handle, the noise that you would expect on the highway is minimal and the feeling of safety is ever present.

My wife loves to drive it even though she has her own Honda Accord, she will take the Jeep whenever she goes shopping.
