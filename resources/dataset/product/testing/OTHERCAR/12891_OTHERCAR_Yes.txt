            We've had our 2002 Mazda Tribute ES V-6 4WD for just over two months. It currently has about 2300 miles. Simply put, we love the Tribute. The 200 HP V-6 engine is quiet and responsive, making the entrance to our local Interstate a snap. The transmission shifts smoothly and quietly. The ride is comfortable, and what you should expect in a short wheelbase SUV of this size. In researching this purchase, I took notice of some writers who complained about wind noise. I find no such problem, either on the Interstate or around town. The seats are comfortable, although somewhat short under the thigh. The driving position is superb and gives an excellent view of the road. This is primarily my wife's vehicle, and she had insisted on nothing too large (she previously drove a 1997 Toyota Camry XLE). She loves the size and ease of handling of the Tribute. The only disappointment so far was the poor dealer prep at the time of delivery. The Tribute was delivered dirty on a Saturday afternoon, and we received a promise for a future detailing. (It was the last day of the month and the dealership clearly wanted the sale to count for that month- remember that on your trip to the dealership!) The TWO subsequent trips for detailing still left a mediocre job. Mazda should also invest more in the quality of the interior. You'll find no lights for the visor vanity mirrors, cheap carpeting in the rear, no link for your garage door remote and the inability to lock/unlock doors from any seat but the driver's! The rear seats fold nicely to provide a generous cargo area. Passenger entry and exit is easy from all four doors. Child seat installation is a breeze, with nicely placed tethers in the rear. The rear doors open widely enough to make the placement of a child in a car seat a pleasure. The exterior fit and finish is very nice, and we've received many compliments on the Tribute's appearance. We preferred the glossy finish of the Tribute's lower body panels and bumpers over the matte finish found on the Ford Escape, although I understand Ford is offering an option for the glossy finish, which I've seen and it is an improvement. The Tribute looks classy and presents a "richer" appearance than its' price. Braking is excellent and the handling is nimble and predictable. This is, in reality, a four passenger vehicle unless you like to be "close"!
