            I bought this vehicle because i needed a reliable car to take me to and from school.  The sales person told my mother and I that this was the best deal.  It was a loaner and had 30,000 miles on it when I bought it in '98.  The car was fine for the first week then all the problems came.  The spark plugs shorted out, at 50,000 miles we were told that the head gasket needed to be replaced as soon as posable.  The bad thing was that they were on national back order.  I waited for 30,000 more miles calling every month to check on the gasket and put on a waiting list at the shop.  Finally at 80,000 miles we were able to get in and get the gasket. What a trip.  
Last month my husband was in a accident that crumbled the front end.  When the car gets hit it crumbles bad.  Most of the parts are on national back order (were have I heard that before) and we had to get parts off junkyard cars!  Also beware of the air bags.  We had over $4,000 worth of front end damage and the air bags did not deploy.  We called the company and they said not to fix the car and they would be out in the next week or so to check the air bags.  With this being my only car i didn't have weeks to wait.  With talking to 5 other breeze owners they all have said the same thing look for something different.   <br><br>
