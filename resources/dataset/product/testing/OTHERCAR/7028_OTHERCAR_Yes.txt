            Out of the five cars that I have previously owned, the Eagle Talon TSi I had a couple years ago was definitely one of the best. Even though it has only four cylinders and 210 hp, it's just as powerful and dependable as a six-cylinder coupe because of its turbo charge, light weight and sleek shape.

I bought this car because I am a big fan of sports cars in general. Having owned a Nissan 240SX, Honda Prelude, and Subaru SVX, among others, I think it is safe to say that the Eagle Talon is &quot;as American as apple pie.&quot; It's very similar to the Mitsubishi Eclipse: identical engine, design, interior, etc. 

The things I enjoyed most about the Eagle Talon were it's beautiful shape, comfortable interior, four-cylinder powerful engine, great handling, and overall performance. 

Although this car is considered a four-passenger vehicle, however, the back seat can barely fit one medium-sized person comfortably. That's the only thing that I didn't really like about this car.

This car is definitely for those who are true Americans at heart, for youth, and for those who can appreciate the performance of a sports car.
