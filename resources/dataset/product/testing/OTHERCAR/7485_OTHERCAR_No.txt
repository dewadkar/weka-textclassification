            From the first spy photos, I have really liked the looks of the Chrysler Cirrus and Dodge Stratus �cloud cars.�.  (I have placed an identical review under both names, so if you read one there is no need to read the other.)  As you may have gathered, I like designs with short overhangs, especially on the front end, and a low cowl/beltline (base of windshield and windows, respectively).  At a time when GM and Ford couldn�t seem to be able to come close to Honda in this area, Chrysler came along and did Honda one better.  The front fenders of this car are amazingly small, and the cowl quite low.  When combined with the high rear deck and slick styling, they give the car a very unique look.  With the possible exception of the 300M, I think these are the best looking cars Chrysler has done.

Unfortunately, these design features led most of the market to see the cloud cars as smaller, and thus cheaper, than they really were.  They have never sold very well, and have often carried generous incentives.  If you like the look, and I gather its subtleties are lost on most people, then this can only sweeten the pot.  I once checked on what a loaded Cirrus�including leather and the V6�was going for.  The dealer was discounting the car, stickered at around 20, to 17 after rebates.  This was easily $7k less than a similarly equipped Camry or Accord.

So, are these cars simply undiscovered gems?  Well, no.  They do have a number of weaknesses to go with their strengths.  These cars have been praised for their roominess inside.  As measured by the EPA, the rear seat is quite large for this class (lower mid-sized): 38 inches in rear legroom.  In use, however, the rear seat is not quite as comfy as these measurements would suggest.  The main culprit is the stylishly low roofline.  This forced the engineers to mount the rear seat close to the floor to provide enough headroom, an old GM trick.  As a result, there is no thigh support for even average-sized people such as myself.  Your legs flop to the sides.  I find this uncomfortable.  Chrysler�s large cars have some of the best rear seats available at any price.  Unfortunately the lessons learned there did not transfer to the cloud car team.  Granted, the Olds Alero suffers from a similar problem.  But the Chevy Malibu, with its unstylishly tall roofline, does not.  I guess it�s a matter of priorities.  In this size car, it tends to be either/or.

The second problem with this car is the view from the driver�s seat: way too much dash.  Because the windshield is slanted so much to produce the �cab forward� styling effect, the dash is very deep.  From the driver�s seat you�re looking across a lot of vinyl, which tends to reflect in the windshield.  Too extreme in my opinion.  The front seats are only moderately comfortable.  They seem overstuffed in places, and smallish in others.  But they sure do look nice in leather.

Performance is similarly a mixed bag.  On paper the six has 168 horsepower.  On the read, it feels weak, and makes unrefined noises.  The flaccid throttle doesn't help; it needs to provide more resistance.  Ten years ago, Mitsubishi engines were the best things in Chryslers cars.  I find it very ironic that the Mitsu engine in these cars is their worst feature.  Handling is good, with minimal lean in turns, but the ride is a bit choppy despite the long wheelbase.  Wind noise is low, but road noises is prominent.

It comes down to personal preference which of these cars is for you.  The look of the Cirrus is more refined and luxurious, while that of the Stratus is more aggressive.  The Stratus also has the manumatic &quot;autostick&quot; available, but I personally have not found these of much benefit.

One last nit is wheels.  Both cars used to have very nice looking wheels.  Then, for '99, they were uglified on both cars.  I have no clue why.  Maybe the new designs are cheaper?  Chrysler has decontented both cars recently, and this may have been another money-saving move.

Ultimately, despite these faults, I think these cars deserved more attention from the market than they received.  Like a middle child, they somehow got lost between Chrysler�s cuter Neon and its flashier big LH cars (Intrepid, etc.)  Chrysler's quality rep didn't help, either.  But, while these are not perfect, for the money you received a lot of nicely styled car.  In the last few years better cars in the same price range have reached the market.  The Olds Alero jumps to mind.  But the cloud cars are being redesigned for the 2001 model year.  Maybe they�ll receive more attention then?
