            I've got a 1500 4x4 SWB Quad Cab, with all the bells and whistles. If there's an option available, it's on this truck.  I'm a 3 time Ram owner, this being my third. Each generation has gotten a little better, with no noticeable changes I don't like.  

Let me tell you what I like first. Classic attractive exterior and interior styling. I've got the bigger of the two V8's, therefore decent pick up and she'll tow a 5,000lb load with little strain. Easy hook up for trailer lights, and if you've got the tow package, a beefier suspension to handle heavy loads without pulling down the rear too much. 

The interior is comfortable, my interior package has the electric 6 way dual seats(superb), electric lumbar support (fantastic), stereo and cruise control built onto the steering wheel (marvy). The drink cup holder is UNSURPASSED, it'll hold a teeny 6oz cup to a 64oz Big Gulp handily. A nice touch is a faint green light that shines down onto the tray for night sipping and driving. 

Electronic door and window buttons are well separated on the arm rest, and have a small green light built in for ease. Double lighted vanity mirrors, and three bright interior lights are handy. (Could use two more lights on the sides of the backseat).

Now I'll tell you what needs improving.  The suspension is tight, even for a 4x4, and the ride can be rough. All of my three Rams have ended up pulling to the right constantly after about 3 months of ownership. Available tires tend to differ on the Rams, I'd rate them all mediocre, expect to replace them at about 40,000 miles.  I'm mostly a highway driver, expect 14-16mpg for the highway, 13-14 for city. 

Air conditioning is fair, I'm in Louisiana, and I know that Chevy truck owners are cooler in their trucks than I am.  I've had some paint problems in the past, but throwing a fit at your dealership usually will get them to cover the problems under warranty, even if it's off warranty.  Dodge seems to know their paint jobs aren't the best.  After a few months of ownership you'll notice some extra rattles from the bed area on bumpy roads and pot holes. 

The Ram is priced more reasonably than comparable vehicles for Chevy and Ford, especially for the extra options. If you want a decent truck with luxuries normally found on cars and mini vans for a reasonable price, the Ram is the way to go.
