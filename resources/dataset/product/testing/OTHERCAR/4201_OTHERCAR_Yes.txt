            My husband and I recently purchased a 1996 Dodge Caravan and we LOVE IT! This van is the easiest thing to drive! I was really worried it would feel *big* but it doesnt! I havent driven something that is this easy to drive since my honda civic! The only problem we have had with the van is my husband was changing a tire and the jack broke...so now we have to go find another jack! The roller in and out seats are very easy to remove but they are hard to lift we had to carry them upstairs into our apartment and they weigh about 100 pounds So we dont remove them anymore!
I love everything about this car! the dual sliding doors the ease of driving it! the controls at the drivers touch! Its wonderful and i recommend it to everyone!<br><br>
