            I have owned my 1995 Trans Sport for about 1 year now.  I Love it.. I wish I had purchased this car years ago.  I have 2 children and was driving a 4 dr Buick.   

I had to admit the front end design was a litte scary at first.  But it just takes time to get use to it.  I can judge the van very well...It does have a long nose but I figure from the edge of my windshield I have a couple of feet.  I usually under judge and have plenty of room.

My Van has a electronic side door which I love...you can turn it off also if that concerns you.  There are 2 buttons in the Van where you can open and shut the the door.  I also have a child seat in the car, which in my opinion all cars should come with these I think they are very safe.

I have 5 passenger seats in the back they are all buckets whick you can remove very easily.   I know when I go shopping there is always a way to fit just about anything in my car.   When I clean my car I take all the seats out and just clean away... The kids love playing in the Van when all of the seats are out.   The seat set up is the driver seat with electric adjustment and the passenger seat.  The I have 3 bucket seats behind the driver and 2 more bucket seats in the back.  

I have taken 2 long rode trips with my 2 children so far and what I do is take the 2 seats in the back right out and we have more than enough room for luggage etc....  The we purchased a tv/vcr combination and put that in the middle of the driver and passenger seat on the floor and the kids are very happy watching there videos in the car for a trip. 
When they need me I can easily walk to them and sometimes I sit in the middle of them and play and talk to them.

The stero controls are on my steering wheel whick are wonderful.
