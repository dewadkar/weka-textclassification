            I never thought I would buy anything other than a Luxury Sedan, but my husband was so impressed with this vehicle, that I decided to test one!  We have two small children, and we travel frequently, so I knew that I would enjoy all of the roominess of the vehicle, but since I wasn't "ready" for the MINIVAN yet, I was considering an SUV for safety purposes, (I was hit by an SUV a few years ago-his damage was $700, mine was over $7000!).  

After driving it around for the day, I was so impressed by all the conveniences of this vehicle, I was "sold".  
I am an advertising executive, so I'm on the road a lot,
and this vehicle is great for the professional who travels frequently.

It has a concealed compartment for my mobile phone, a place for my laptop in the center console, and a compartment to hide my purse.  

And for those parents who wish to listen to a separate radio station or CD than the kids or teens, they can listen to their own music via headphones in the back with separate controls.

As far as seating comfort - my ONLY complaint is the head rest, I can't seem to get AS comfortable as I was in my car.

Second row passengers have great arm rests that have extendable cupholders, and storage space.

AND the vents do let air come through even if you shut them all the way (my last car's vents were completely sealed when you closed them), but from what I hear this is typical with GM Cars!

For about $1500 more you can add the option of a television for the back seat passengers - complete with a DVD player.

For those in the Market NOW you can get 0% on Rendez-Vous's
AND a CASH rebate! And since the 2003's are out I'm sure you can negotiate a deal on 2002's!
