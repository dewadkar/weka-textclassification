            I don't know where some people get their information, but I have found from first hand experience that the Plymouth Voyager is top rate and SAFE.
First of all, Chrysler-Plymouth is now owned by Daimler....recognize it?
Think Mercedes and its extremely high safety rate.
On December 14, 1999, I was pulling onto a main street to make a left turn,
the light with me, and after looking left and right when the light turned green for me,...WHAM! I was broad-sided by a small compact zipping along at about 50-55 MPH. The compact was totaled, the driver's airbag failed to deploy, and she was injured. (Fortunately, her injuries were not threatening.)My Voyager sustained serious damage from the side doors to the grill, but the strength of the frame and the van's build, saved me from very serious injury. Although the Van sustained some $6,000 of
damage, it withstood a very tough test! I am sold on the Plymouth Voyager, as is my mechanic. Had this been a pre-Daimler built vehicle,
I am told, it would have been extremely worse. I always say, &quot;The proof is in the pudding&quot;, and with my experience, the proof is clearly evident.<br><br>
