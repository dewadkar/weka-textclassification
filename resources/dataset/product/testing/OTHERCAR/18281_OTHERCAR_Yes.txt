            I have owned my 4 door, hard top Tracker for almost 3 Years now. We live in the mountains and wanted a smaller (we also have a 4WD pickup) vehicle that we could take when we go hunting, fishing or just to see what we can see. This has been a great car. I drive it around town, over the passes and all around the country.
I've only gotten stuck once, in mud that was at least 2 feet deep and got out pretty easily by putting branches under the wheels, putting the car in 4 wheel low, and slowly pulling it out.
I have only had to have it repaired once, and that was my fault. It is really good on gas, and I can change the oil myself, its that easy to get to. 
I will admit that it is a little sluggish on the high passes, like when I go to Denver, but the overall proformance is very good.
Driving my Tracker is very easy and I feel safe in it. My sister-in-law would like to drive it but she can't drive a standard (am I smart or what?). 
I would recommend this vehicle to anyone who wants a good depedable car that can work like a truck when necessary. I rate mine very highly.
