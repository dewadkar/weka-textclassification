            <b>I'm almost a GM convert</b>
My stepbother bought a new dodge Quad Cad Dakota partly to bug me and my dad. My dad works for GM and I'm an hardcore GM lover. I have always liked the Dodge designers and thought that the Quad Cab look nice (I wished GM would get good designer for once). 

I just took a 1000 mile road trip up to a golf resort in Michigan and we took his Quad Cab. I was really surprised with the amount of room and comfort that the truck had. The ride was quite and smooth. 

<b>The ride</b>
Dodge has put a lot of work into their handling and ride of the truck. It combines the smooth, soft ride of a car, with the hualing and towing power of a truck. The cloth bucket seats were great, with the right amount of support and firmness. 

The interior of the truck is very functional and well placed. It seems like there is a cup holder located in every convenent place. The interior lights are also balanced thoughout the vehicle. I could read the small print of a map with ease with the reading lights on.

The sound system in the truck is unreal. The sound and bass is great for long trips, or just annoying the person stopped beside you at a red light. Another great feature is the audio controls that are located on the back side of the steering wheel, which make using the radio a lot better and safe. With the controls on the back you don't ever have to take your hands off the wheel, or look down at the wheel to make sure that you don't hit the wrong buttons.

<b>You have so many options to choose from</b>
I have to hand it to Dodge, they got a Dakota trim that will fit anyone. They have three different engines to choose from, one V6 and two V8's. The trucks are loaded with so many different options that you can customize this truck into your dream vehicle. One thing that is disappointing, Dodge does not offer leather seats in the Dakota.

<b>Dodge has master everything else, why not gas mileage?</b>
I don't know which is worse, the monthly payment or playing for the gas a month. With my stepbother's truck, which is a 2WD with a 360 V8 he averages 12-14MPG. He does run it hard, but still that is terrible. With our Suburban, which is a lot bigger and weights a lot more, we get 15 city and 18 Highway. I'm sorry, I think that is terrible out of a small truck to get that low of mileage.

<b>Overall</b>
Besides the gas mileage and the iffy transmission I would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone needing the space and comfort at a good price. Dodge has done a good job with design and options, they just need to work on gas mileage. When they master that I'll have one setting in my driveway.<br><br>
