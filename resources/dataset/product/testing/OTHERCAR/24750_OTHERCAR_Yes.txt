            Bought this camera in August 2001 --- Luv it! Best camera I ever owned.

The sales price was painful ($700), but you do get what you pay for from SONY. Also, had to buy more memory for it...I splurged and got a 128MB Memory Stick for about $125.
[so it is equal to about 10 rolls (36 exposures each) of typical 35mm chemical film capacity].

The computer processor really does take all the hassle & guesswork out of picture taking. Once you learn a few basic control functions on the camera it consistently delivers professional quality photos. It's clear that the days of conventional chemical-based film & cameras are numbered.

I've got big bucks invested in an old 35mm camera & lenses, but it just sits in a closet-- because it's too complicated and too bulky to haul around. Have some compact film cameras too, but the typical photo quality I get is only fair.

Note that I bought the SONY DSC-S75 which is basically the same as the SONY DSC-S70 but with some good improvements.
They are both 3.1 megapixel cameras -- picture quality is very satisfactory for most users; you don't need higher pixel cameras unless you need true professional quality.
Even the 1.3 megapixel cameras are good, unless you expect to make lots of 8x10 inch print blow-ups.

SONY makes good cameras and prices vary dramatically for the older versions (especially on the internet). You'll probably see some good deals soon on the SONY DSC-S50 (2.1 megapixel)
if your budget is tight.

My overall advice-- 'Go Digital'
