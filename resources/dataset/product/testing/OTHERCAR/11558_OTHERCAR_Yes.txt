            My wife needed a new (or a nice used) vehicle after her 1996 Plymouth Breeze started to burn oil. One thing that was decided was that she wanted an SUV because they sit higher off the ground than her Breeze. Anyone who has ever rolled in and out of a Breeze can understand that.

On to the search!!! We drove miles and miles looking for a Jeep. On of our friends has a Jeep Cherokee and she commented on how much she liked the Jeep's, so we went out on a search for one, new or used. We first looked at a new Jeep Liberty Sport and found that it was a little out of our price range. After being let down on the fact that we couldn't afford a brand new Jeep (hey, times are tough!!!) we decided to find a used one. After driving a few more day's and test driving numerous Jeep Grand Cherokee's and regular Cherokee's, my wife and I were about to give up hope when we drove by a typical used car lot and there it was...a beautiful solid black 1999 Jeep Cherokee. After test driving it, my wife and I were sold. The Jeep had 36,000 miles on it and it had just come off a lease. The guy at the car lot wanted $12,000 for it, with trade in, negotiating, and taxes, it came to around $10,000 even. Not too bad. It wasn't new, but it did fit our price range.

On to the options. The only visable thing wrong with the vehicle besides a few scratches, was that the antenna was missing. No big deal...an easy fix. The interior has grayish cloth front bucket seats, the full instrument gauges, CD player with tape player (they still make tapes?), power windows and door locks, rear wiper with defogger, Selec-Trac 4WD, raised white letter tires, digital odometer, and the 4.0 inline six cylinder engine. There is also alot of room for your cargo. The rear seat also folds down for even more room. The interior is no-frills. It has heat and A/C and a good stereo, but it does not have the luxury thrills of a Grand Cherokee or an Explorer. Everything is straight-forward in the Cherokee. Everything is easy to find and use. It is a Jeep...it is not a fru-fru Escalade that is only designed for luxury.

The 4.0 engine is a monster motor. The engine cranks out 190 horsepower and over 200 torque. Plenty of towing power and alot of off the line accelaration. This vehicle has no problems passing someone on the highway, either. Mash the gas pedal and the engine roars to life. Also, with the inline six, you can change your own spark plugs and wires, because all six are highly visable and easily within reach. The manual also explains in great detail on how to change all fluids yourself, unlike most manuals that tell you to simply take it to the dealer. I was hooked on this engine after the first drive. I had heard that the 4.0 I-6 had been very reliable throughout the years and hopefully, our will be one of those. The one drawback to the monster 4.0 is that it takes alot of gas. The gas tank holds 20 gallons and believe me, you will need it. In a mix of city and highway driving, I am averaging around 17 miles per gallon. If you are looking for gas economy, you will not find it with the Jeep Cherokee. If you want gobs of power and the best off-road capability, than the Jeep Cherokee is for you. I have had one problem, a fuse blew for the dash lights, I replaced it, no problem. The ride is fairly comfortable for a Jeep. There is little road noise and, despite what others say, the engine is not loud. I would compare it to a light truck. You are not getting a car. You are getting a Jeep SUV. You can't take corners in the Cherokee like you can in a car, but hey, the Jeep wasn't designed to handle like a car. It is a Jeep through and through. It's a classic. When other vehicles look off-road, they cringe up and back away. The Jeep smiles and goes to work!!!
