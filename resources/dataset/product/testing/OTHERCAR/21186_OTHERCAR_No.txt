            I'm currently driving a Geo Metro LSI as a rental car while my jeep cherokee is being repaired as the result of a side impact collision. 

I guess if you are the ultimate conservationist or really hard up for cash than I could see buying this car. For that matter seeing the price of the car you could probably purchase it using ones credit card. Besides my auto coverage had an allowance that covered the bare minimum for a rental car.

That peppy engine leaves alot to be desired. In between I believe 2nd and 3rd gear flooring the accelerator you experience a pause in the car and then a sudden lurch forward. Don't try the standard 0-60 mph test unless you have an hourglass as your timing instrument. I'm able to get the vehicle up to 75 mph, but I was driving in some high winds around the san francisco bay area and it was moving the vehicle from side-to-side. By the way there is no power steering so it was kinda kick to get my daily arm exercise into play.

The interior is pretty much spartan. It can comfortably seat four people. The vehicle came with both a driver and passenger airbags. The standard radio wasn't too bad no tapedeck was included. I have to say the outside noise level was barely noticeable. This car has none of the driving comforts I've become accustomed to like: cruise control, adjustable steering wheel, adjustable seat.

My main beef with the car was the severe blindspot on the drivers side. This can probably be corrected with a fisheye mirror attached to the side mirrors. I would always take double takes to make sure a car wasn't alongside me during a lane change.

If you just want cheap transportation and have to have a brand new car but are strapped for cash go ahead.
