            I am a great fan of the new Audi's.  I had a '99 1/2 A4 1.8T up until last month that I loved and now I just recently leased the 2000 TT.  The Audi TT is unbelievable!  It drives like a dream and the gear box is like butter!

The car looks great.  The lines of the car are beautiful and the brilliant black color really accents the car. The brushed aluminum accents really stand out against the black leather interior.

The trunk is surprisingly big.  I was able to fit a new vacuum cleaner in the back without having to turn down the back seats.

The sound system is sweet! The nobs on the dash are easy to reach and everything looks very proportionate.  The dash lights accent the car really well and the little sporty steering wheel, begs to be touched.
 
I don't have the Quattro, but I do have ASR and the car is great in the rain.  The engine just purrs.    

Its an pretty comfortable ride, unless you are an adult in the back (its not very big back there). There are stickers on the car that tell you that the back seat is really only for people under 4'3&quot;.

The TT not only looks awesome, but has a lot of great features.  Audi paid a lot of attention to detail when they designed this new car.  I really must say that the Germans do know how to design a beautiful car!  And the price makes a great package!  If you can find a dealer that can get their hands on one, don't even hesitate to buy/lease one.  <br><br>
