                 I recently traded in my 1996 Toyota Rav4 for a 1999 Rav4. I fell into a great lease deal and moved up...6 disc CD changer, power moonroof, L model amenities, and more drink holders!! The pick-up has increased from the 96 to the 99, one of the only real qualms I had about owning it. I still don't feel like Mario Andretti, but getting onto the highway is easier and the ECT (electronically controlled transmission), when I remember to put it on, certainly helps and seems to add even more power than it did on the 96.  The size of the Rav4 is perfect, enough room for 3 kids in the back (including a car seat!) Over the last 8 months we have transported 10 large bags of mulch, a christmas tree, a boxed exercise system, various pieces of furniture, etc. and have gone on 2 6+ hour trips with nary a whine!! We have not had the occasion to use it in the snow yet, but have traveled for several hours in freezing rain and while other vehicles (including the larger sport utility vehicles) were fishtailing and sliding, it held the road like it was on dry pavement.   All in all, great utility &amp; great fun!!<br><br>
