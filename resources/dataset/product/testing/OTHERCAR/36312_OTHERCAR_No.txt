            Let me start by saying I am a car freak. Yes... a car freak. I have a new car every 7 to 12 months, but thats just a problem I like having. I know you can't really compare this car with the likes of the vehicles I have owned, but stay with me for a minute. I purchased the 2003 Infiniti G35 LOADED! You can't get another option... Previously owning two BMW 328's (1996 and a 1998), 1999 Mercedes C280, 2000 Mercedes CLK 430 (which I should have kept), Infiniti QX4 and then the Infiniti G35. Again, I am not putting the G35 in the class of these other cars... except the 328's and possibly the C280. Where the Infiniti is good: The car has decent pick up and is probably a bit over rated at the 6.2 second 0-60. Its more like 7.0 seconds, but the pick up feels good. The interior design is (in my opinion) better than that of the BMW and the Mercedes in almost any model and the body of the car is rather appealing. 

The bad things on the G35: The sound system is kind of weak. With the volume up the door panels rattle and is very annoying for anyone who likes to drive around with the volume cranked. I am not sure if its tires, but the car does roll a bit in and out of turns. The engine makes awful sounds when its hot out...seems to have a temper. 

Overall the car is decent for the money, but if I were to spend ($37,000 with all options) this kind of money, I would highly recommend spending about $4,000 more and going to a BMW or Mercedes dealer.
