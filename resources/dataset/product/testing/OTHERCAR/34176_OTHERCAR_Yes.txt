               The story all starts on one fine summer day last June, when my mother's Dodge Caravan died for no reason (again) in traffic. This was perhaps the third of fourth time it had happened in the previous two months. She was fed up with it, and I think more than a little scared of it too. So she called my dad during work and asked if he could "pick up a new car on the way home" (seriously!). The lease on it was just about up, and we had been doing research on which new car would suit us best. We do a lot of skiing, so we knew we wanted something big with all wheel drive. But with the nearest skiing 2-and-a-half hours away, and the best skiing being 4-and-a-half hours way, the bouncy, jouncy ride of an SUV was unacceptable. We had settled on the Subaru Outback. After hammering out a (good) deal, we headed home to discuss it with "the missus" when I mentioned the VW had an enticing new awd wagon. Passing the VW dealership, he decided to take a look at one. He was so impressed that he was willing to pay the extra $7000 over the Subaru to get it, notable considering that he hated VW for the old Beetle, and also that he strayed from his budget to have it. He never does that! That was the beginning of a beautiful relationship.

   ENGINE:
The engine is the Audi-developed 2.8l, twin-cam, 30v V6. What that means is that it's smooth, sophisticated and powerful. This car jumps off the line, rare for a German car, and rarer still since it has an automatic transmission which usually saps power, and it keeps on going with only a slight drone all the way up to the redline. In my opinion, this is one fine engine and there is a definithe reason why Audi uses it in its $40,000+ cars.
   TRANSMISSION:
The transmission is the 5-speed Tiptronic transmission; basically, it has five gears, and a manual mode. I won't go into it too much, since the benefits of the manual mode are limited, and we never use it. Basically, manual mode was intended to emulate the excitement of driving a manual transmission car while keeping the convenience of an automatic for traffic and such. But while it's in the normal automatic mode, the shifts are ultra-smooth, though sometimes less that crisp. Still, the fake wood knob and chrome baseplate look good and overall it's a success.
   INTERIOR:
The interior is pretty good. It's well put together out of excellent materials, comfortable and pretty good looking with the fake wood trim. Still there are minor grievances: The cupholders just suck. The one in the back broke upon its second use, and the one in front is practically useless as it is without adjustments and looks flimsy. But that's typical German; most Europeans drive manuals, so they don't carry drinks with them very often since it would interfere with shifting. Hence, the cupholder designs on European cars are typically pretty bad. Also, the radio is too small. Another German trait, it's caused by the fact that many years ago - twenty or so I would assume - the German automakers settled on a standard size for radios to make aftermarket purchases and such things easier. the result: twenty years of new techonology has to fit in the same space, making for a crowded, confusing radio. Then there are the reclining seats. the Germans still use that stupid, hard to use wheel to recline the seats. Other than that, it's all good: the seats are comfortable, the seat heaters are good and the whole atmosphere says "luxury".
   HANDLING:
Handling is German: responsive and fun. for a 3400-lb. car, it's very tossable and the awd system, called 4Motion (VW's version of Audi's famous Quattro awd system), adds a lot of corner-carving safety, providing excellent traction, especially in snow. The problem here is with the tires: ours came with p195/65r15 tires which were intended more for bad weather driving than for corner carving; they give up their grip pretty easily under hard cornering, but that's easily enough taken care of if that's a problem for you. This car can also be bought with more cornering-happy 205/55r16 tires if you so desire. But eitherway, no chains required! We've driven it several times through snowstorm in the mountains where we always felt safe, secure, and in control.   
   OTHER STUFF:
The exterior, though slightly conservative, especially in wagon form, is still handsome. overall fit and finish is superb and the car feels rock solid. The blue-and-red gauges are the coolest on the road, plus the gargo area in the back is well designed and is the perfect size. The only problems are that one time it wouldn't start. The starter would turn over, but the car itself just wouldn't start. We had it towed to the dealership, where, lo and behold, it started instantly and all tests came out negative for problems. The dealership itself screwed us over too. We had made a deal to have a ski rack put on top of the car by VW as part of the cost. When we went back to finally get it, first it was a missing screw, and then they couldn't find any records of such a deal and wouldn't honor it. And, of course, one of our two sales associates had left, so she couldn't back us up, and the other one denied such a deal. We ended up getting another one. But if you gome to some sort of special deal at ANY dealership, GET IT IN WRITING.
   OVERALL:
A great car that is almost worth the $30,000 or so dollars that VW asks for it. I recommend it only for those for whom a Ford taurus is too demeaning, and a luxury car is over the top. Great work VW!
