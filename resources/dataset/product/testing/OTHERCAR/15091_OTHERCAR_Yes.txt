            I have the opportunity to drive several different makes and models of cars.  I am always happy to drive a Lincoln Continental.  It has the appearance of luxury and it delivers exactly that.  It's easy to maneuver and it's comfortable.  When I first had the experience of driving a Lincoln Continental, I felt intimidated by the size and thought that I would never be able to park a car like this very easily.  Boy, was I mistaken.  I was able to park it as smoothly as any other car I had driven and as far as the size, that had no bearing on the maneuverability.  The instrument panel tells you everything you could possibly want to know about outside air temperature, the car needs (oil, water, etc,), the seat adjusts to fit your specific height and leg space.  
The only drawback with a vehicle this size is the amount of miles per gallon it gets.  But if that's something that doesn't matter to you, this is a perfect car for the open road or for a drive around town.  
It makes you feel like a million dollars!!<br><br>
