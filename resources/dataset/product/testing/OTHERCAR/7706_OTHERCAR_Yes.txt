            The Tahoe is the &quot;king of the road.&quot;  The Tahoe combines power, roominess, and versatility to be considered a great truck.  I had one Tahoe than recently upgraded to the 99' LT.  The Tahoe's power tows large loads such as a boat with ease.  The Tahoe also has less road noise than many of its competitors.  The newer Tahoe's steering is tighter to give it a sportier feel.  The Tahoe has the smooth ride of a luxury car and an interior comparable to it.  The interior has every feature one could need for sport, luxury, or utility.  Fold down seats offers additional room in the back to give about 6' of storage space.  Also, the Tahoe has some additional handy features like a garage door opener holder, three cig. lighter outlets, and compass\temp on the mirror.  Overall this truck is a smooth powerful truck which is great for work or play.<br><br>
