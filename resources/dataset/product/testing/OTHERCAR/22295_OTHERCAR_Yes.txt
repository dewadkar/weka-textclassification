            My husband and I are expecting our third child and decided that our Honda Civic needed a big brother/sister.  My husband went to Dallas to look for a good deal on either a new minivan or new truck.  I was partial to a new minivan, so he started focusing on a few minivans to purchase.  The 1st reason we picked this minivan was its price to feature ratio.  You get SO MUCH great stuff in a low low price!  We have CD/ dual AC/ alloy wheels, power windows, door locks, and mirrors and even heated mirrors all for 20,000!!!  What other minivan could you give you so much for so little??  The 2nd reason we bought it was for it's 3rd row hideaway seat.  This feature is only available in the Mazda MPV and the Honda Odyssey, which is thousands more to purchase and nearly impossible to track down!!  The 3rd reason we bought this minivan was for it's sporty look.  It's not your typical bulky van, and yet has sooo much room.  We LOVE this van and hate NOTHING about it.  It drives like a car, and even with its 170 HP engine, it's very peppy!  I think this vehicle is for everyone who wants lots of drink and cup holders with kids who love to be able to roll down their own windows and for those who have a budget in mind...which is almost everyone out there!!!  BUY THIS VAN...it's wonderful!<br><br>
