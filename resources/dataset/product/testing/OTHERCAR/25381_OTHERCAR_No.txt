            I wanted a cheap little camera for posting pictures on on-line auctions. I spotted this cute camera at a local discount retailer and compared it to other similar models on the shelf. I thought I was getting what I needed until I could afford to upgrade. The price was right for an impromptu purchase at less than $20.<p>I've tried to take pictures indoors and outdoors, none with much success. Too much light causes glare, low light results in an image that is dark and sallow. I've tried taking pictures in the sunlight, but overcast days were better for taking pictures. I've had problems getting the image seen through the viewfinder become the image displayed on my computer screen.<p>I've tried using the included software to enhance the photos, but have had no success adjusting picture quality. The Photo Print software is worthless for this camera. I doubt there is a photo to be taken that would be good enough to waste paper and ink to print.<p>The camera includes a web-cam feature. It was all right, but there is nothing included to secure the camera while in use. It was difficult to balance the camera near the computer while it was connected to the U.S.B., and have it transfer video images include self as the subject. Even with overhead lighting, the image was dark, but it was better than the photos.
