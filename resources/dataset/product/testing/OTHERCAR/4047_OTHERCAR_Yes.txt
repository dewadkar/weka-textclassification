            Mazda Tribute, 2002 

The Tribute looks for a Niche.

With its new tribute Mazda is trying to attract a different kind of SUV client. The one that not only likes the rugged aspect of an all wheel drive vehicle but who is also looking for the comfortable ride of a large sedan.

Mazda has tagged the Tribute as the sport sedan of SUV. To do so Mazda has equipped the Tribute with sport-tuned multi-link transmission, quick reaction steering and a car-like monocoque body construction.

The Tribute is available in three different trims, the basic DX, which by the way is very well equipped, and the more upscale LX and ES.

The Tribute I test drove was a DX, so I will concentrate the rest of my review on this model.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The Tribute has a curb weight of 3091 pounds, its wheelbase is 103.1 inches, and it measures 173 inches long, 71.9 inches wide and 69.9 inches in height. Its standard towing capacity is 3000 pounds, this is not sufficient if you to tow a large trailer, you may have to reinforce it.
 
Even if the DX trim is the basic Tribute it does come with an impressive list of standard equipment which I will enumerate when describing the interior of this SUV. but as impressive is the new high tech features they have made available for the tribute.

One being sport-tuned multi-link suspensions that will not only give the driver and its passenger a smoother ride it will also allow the Tribute to have a better grip on the pavement.

 The other is the four-wheel anti-lock brake system, which comes with the advanced Electronic Brake Force Distribution system or (EBFD).

THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR

The interior:

After I opened the front door on the driver&#146s side, I immediately knew that Mazda was in a race with other SUV manufacturers and they meant business. They really went all the way in the interior of the Tribute. The quality of the material and the workmanship is all A-1.

Once behind the steering wheel and after adjusting the drivers seat to a comfortable setting, you will have an excellent front and side view, but the same must be repeated about the Tribute as I always do when reviewing other large vehicles, be careful while backing up, it does take some time to get use to the new length and height of such a vehicle.

From the driver&#146s position you will have an excellent view of all the gauges and all the control buttons are also located within easy reach.

The Mazda Tribute DX I test drove had the following standard equipment: Air conditioning, power window, power locks, power mirrors, tilt steering, cruise control, AM/FM radio, CD player, luggage rack and rear window defroster. 

It also was equipped with the following optional features; alloy wheels, sunroof, side airbags and ABS brake system with (EBFD).

The space in both the front and rear seat of the Tribute is excellent and the cargo volume at 17.8 cubic feet should be enough to transport most of your gears.

The exterior:

I like the exterior body styling of the Tribute; Mazda has given a shorter front end and added more space to the interior. They claim that the Tribute is 5.5 inches longer than the Cherokee.

The side view mirrors it comes equipped with are OK as long as you do not plan to pull a long trailer, if you do you will need to add larger mirror for safety.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION

The Mazda Tribute I test drove had under the hood:

Engine: A 2.0 liters, 4-cylinder engine that develops 130 horsepower at 5400 RPM.
Transmission: A 5-speed manual transmission.
Brakes: Front discs and rear drums, with optional ABS.
Tires: 215/70R16
Safety: Dual front airbags.
           Side front airbags (optional).
           Keyless entry (optional).
           Child safety locks.
         
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

The Mazda Tribute I test drove was excellent diving on the highway and acceptable for within city driving. I would recommend for anyone who may be considering one to take a second look at the V-6 engine, I think the 4-cylinder is a little under powered for this type of vehicle.
