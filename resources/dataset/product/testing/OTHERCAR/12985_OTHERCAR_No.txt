            I know this review of the 2001 Kia Rio may not be all that helpful, but I just wanted to get the word out about what happened to me in my car.

I bought a brand new 2001 Sunburst Gold Kia Rio on August 16, 2001.  I LOVED this car sooooo much...it is absolutly wonderful.  I felt very very safe in it.

Yesterday, November 2nd, I was involved in a car accident.  I was driving on a Highway in Detroit when there was a traffic jam.  The traffic came to a stop, and so I stopped.  I looked in my rear view mirror and I saw this dark colored car flying up behind me.  I thought he was going to stop, but then the next thing I remember seeing the windshield crack, and felt the car slam into the car in front of us...my right leg was flung up on the dash board and it cracked the window, my other leg was jammed under the steering column, I had my seat belt on...BUT it did not lock up on the impact when the car hit us...which caused my entire chest and stomache to hit the steering wheel.  I have two front air bags in my car...and NONE of them went off.....AT ALL.  Then to top it off...on impact, after I had hit the steering wheel, my seat snapped ALL the way back.  Had my friend been sitting on the back seat drivers side, he would have been crushed. LUCKILY we were not hurt as bad as we thought we were.  I have a seviere case of whiplash, a few fractured ribs, a bruised lung (Which they thought at first was collapsed) and severe internal bruising.  My boyfriend suffered from a severe case of whiplash, and my friend in the car, he had his seatbelt on in the back seat, but his seatbelt did not lock up...and his face smashed into the side paneling on the door where you can adjust the front passenger seat belt.  His teeth were busted up, he had to get three staples in his head for a bad cut, and he has a severe case of whiplash.  I got to leave the hospital today 11-3-01 and we found out that the guy who hit us was going about 60 mph...so I think we are VERY lucky...

I now believe that this car is NOT safe.  My car...that I've had for not quite three months now, looks like an accordian.  The police and paramedics had to take the doors off to get us out.  

I would definatly look into the safety issue of the 2001 Kia Rio before purchasing.  I know that every car hold its dangers....but the airbags in my car did not go off...nor did the seatbelts lock up...and nor did my seat stay in an upright position.

BE SURE to reaserch info on a car before you buy...I wish I would have.
