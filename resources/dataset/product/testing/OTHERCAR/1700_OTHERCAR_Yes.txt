            My wife had been driving a Mitsubishi Expo LRV for over 7 years and it had become very unreliable. The last time it broke down was the last straw for her and she commanded that I go forth and obtain a new vehicle for her.

<b>Why we bought the CRV:</b>

She wanted something compact, but still wanted to be able to haul our two golden retrievers to the vet and the beach. A true compact would never do. An SUV was the best solution for hauling puppies (or our scuba gear on dive trips), but due to their popularity, SUVs are <b>ridiculously</b> priced.

We started looking for late model used SUVs. Blazers, Explorers, Troopers, Outbacks... the list seemed endless. Also, the prices felt painful to even look at! Sticker shock abounds on SUVs, new or used.

My wife had owned a Honda once before and really loved it. We both felt that Honda engineering was top notch and their products were very reliable. After looking at all the SUVs we could find in the area, we soon developed a short list of acceptable vehicles. These included:

  Honda Passport
  Isuzu Rodeo (same thing, really)
  Honda CRV
  Subaru Outback

We pretty quickly narrowed our search down to the CRV. The Rodeo and Passport were difficult for her to drop and raise the back seats and the Outbacks were extremely scarce on the used market. In fact, we never found a used one at all!

After several weeks, on a nasty rainy Saturday, we finally found a used CRV with an acceptable price tag and mileage sitting on a dealers lot. It had almost all the options with the exception of the roof rack. After a little haggling, my wife was the proud new owner of a slightly used CRV. We've owned it now for nearly a year, enough for me to feel comfortable writing an epinion about it.

<b>What we like:</b>

The car is about the perfect size for my wife. On the outside it's no bigger than her old Expo, but it seems substantially larger on the inside.

It maneuvers well and is easy for her to park.

The hauling capacity is more than adequate for her needs. It can carry all our diving gear or both dogs.

<b>What we dislike:</b>

It certainly cannot be described as a quiet ride. Road noise is substantial.

Acceleration is modest, but (unlike me) she drives very conservatively so she doesn't even notice.

The ride is more like a small truck than a car, but that should probably be expected from an SUV.

The model we got had deeply tinted windows. This interferes with visibility even during the day.

The rear seat belts have a small clip embedded in the side molding to hold them. The belts frequently slip out of these clips and will whack against the sides while driving. Very annoying and unsettling until you figure out what that &quot;popping&quot; sound is.

Mileage, for a Honda, is not that great. We aren't tracking it that closely, but it seems to be around 22-23 mpg.

<b>How does it drive?</b>

Actually, it's a little stiff. Since I drive a full size truck, the ride doesn't seem bad, but it sure isn't like a nice luxury car.

It certainly feels top heavy when turning. Probably because it is. Aren't most SUVs a little heavy on top?

The engine is on the small side and the acceleration is modest. Of course, it's not a sports car, so we shouldn't expect it to behave like one.

<b>Who should buy this car?</b>

As the title of this epinion suggests, this is a specialized vehicle. It is small and a family of four would be crowded. For a couple of DINKS like us, it works out very well. As a SUV for a couple, we both feel it was (and still is) our best choice. It is suitable for hauling camping gear, fishing tackle, hiking gear, dive gear...all sorts of sport related activities. It won't carry the soccer team and would be a poor choice for a 4-person car pool. It has a sufficient fuel capacity that the range is pretty decent. It'll go a ways on a tank of gas.

<b>Closing remarks:</b>

It does what we ask of it and does it well. It's not a luxury vehicle and it won't tow much of a trailer. It suits my wife perfectly and she couldn't be happier with it.<br><br>
