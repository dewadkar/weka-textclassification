                 For my high school graduation I was given a 1989 Buick Regal.  Even though it was nine years old it still looked great.  I was happy then and I am still pleased with the vehicle.  I finally retired it after 160,000 miles.
     My car ALWAYS started.  The engine was sound and the suspension was phenomenal.  My parents bought a Cadillac and I can't say that the 1991 Cadillac had anything on the handling and comfort of my buick.  The steering was &quot;memory steering&quot; (as told to me by my mechanic) which pulls the front end in the direction you are turning.  This makes the turns tight and efficient. 
     As the car aged I began to have problems with the dash.  Buick has since discontinued the use of digital dashes.  My odometer quit working around 100,000 miles, so I had to keep track of how far I drove with a pen and paper. 
     I now drive a 1996 Chevy Cavalier and I must say that I am not getting better gas mileage then I was getting with the Buick.  For a car that was 11yrs old, a V6 and heavy I was averaging 25mpg city and highway.  
     The benefit to the weight of a Buick is that it is great in the snow.  I never had any problem with driving in any condition.  The width of the car enabled you to be in control of the car at all times.  
     Driving the car is enjoyable.  It is quick and comfortable.  It should be pleasing to all that drive it.
