              I run a news room, a very small news room, but a seven-day a week operation. My film costs have doubled in the last year and I've had more environmental nut bars (although I'm one myself) poking around my office this last two years than I have ever seen before.
<b> So why am I going digital?</b> Because it makes environmental and economic sense. I run through, well not me but the newsroom, 10 rolls of film a day. At $7 a roll, well my math sucks but bear with me, that's  $70 a day. I can't tell you what it costs me in fix and bleach and developer, daily, but it's a whack of money in a month, and chemicals are not my bag. Especially not when they don't go through the recovery system correctly, which happens, even in computerized processing systems which we use, and hell yeah, it's pollution. On film costs alone, at $700 bucks a pop for this digital, I save the price of the camera in three months.
So I went to my local camera shop and i asked about high end equipment which I'll outfit some of my shooters with, but for day to day newspaper quality prints (we're talking high res here) I'm looking at this little $700 Coolpix 950.
<b> How snazzy is it?</b> It comes with  a 2.11 megapixel 1/2 inch CCD which provides photographic image quality at print sizes up to 11 X 14. At basic quality you can put 128 pics on this beasty, but at the quality I want, there's only eight pics per memory card. I don't like that. I'll be packing extra memory cards for each of my staff, but at about $30 a card for eight pics.. in perpetual use... balanced against $7 a film for 24 shots burned and gone... well you get the picture. We're printing at 170 dpi, and most web pages produce images at 72 dpi, so you can double your usage if this is your despired output. The digital Coolpix 950 can be programmed to supply an endless array of quality. But I'm thinking, even for top quality, it's a steal.
<b> Bless this camera</b> I was out last night for a blessing of a field where crops are being grown to feed the hungry. Me and my sandals didn't mix well with the muck and the corn. Didn't want to get too close to cow patties either. I very much appreciated the	3X optical zoomlens and the autofocus. I liked being able to revert my pic to black and white. We print that way mostly, and my artistic senses tell me in personal shots that black and white is best.
<b>The hype on this </b>will tell you there is high speed continuous shooting of up to 2 frames per second, but I say no way. I've caught the back of heads several times now, when focusing elsewhere. I don't like this shutter action and hope they improve it pronto. 
<b> Processing bliss</b>Once in photoshop I have very few amendments to make. No corrections for bad souping or bad film.
<b>Composition</b> Very  much What You See Is What You Get</b> Save memory and money by deleting poor quality or poor composition pics right away.
<b> The telephoto, wide angle and fisheye lenses</b> are not bad at all, works well for most of the pics we take, but I need a card reader to download pics here (another $80,) which is something I don't need with a more expensive model I'm trying out. I think for the $800 difference, if I were using this for domestic use, I'd opt for this CoolPix 950, and pay the extra $80. The reason I'm also trying out a more expensive model is that it has a stabilizer feature which is important in low lighting and fast speed situations like a good old hockey game in an arena. (Later for that review on an Olympus model).
