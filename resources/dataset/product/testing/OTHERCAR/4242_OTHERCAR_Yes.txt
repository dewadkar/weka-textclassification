            I thought I'd add my 2-cents because eopinions.com is lacking a plain-Jane review of the car w/o all the technical car-talk crap. 

I bought this car in 2000. Apparently they ran out of 2000's, so I had to wait 2 months for the 2001's to come out. Also, this review assumes you know what MANY features this car has (if I actually start listing them, this will get even more ridiculously long).

What POV I'm coming from:  I'm a girl who's old enough to get forced off her parents' auto insurance and likes to freak out men when they realize it's a girl driving this car.  I don't mean to be sexist, but it IS the "dude car" of Volkswagen...or so I keep hearing =P.

Concerning the outsides:  Well, just look @ it...and I'm sure you have.  It screams "cutie", especially since I girly'd it up, which is why I wonder how 2 more cylinders on an engine make a big fat difference (actually I do, but then I'd be getting technical on you).  It also looks as it is--built well.  Close a Chevy Camaro door and then close the door of this car, and you'll know what I'm talking about.

Concerning the insides:  As everyone else says, it IS small inside, but I'm short (5'1") so it's okay.  Actually, I think there IS a height minimum for this car because I have the seat moved as close as it goes and put some effort to press the clutch (w/o shoes on).  Plus the little sun visor above the rearview mirror doesn't do a thing for me because I'm too short.  Ergonomics are cool, and so is the black leather interior.  Getting used to adjusting the Euro-styled front seats took awhile, but then again, no one drives it but me so it doesn't get moved much =).

Concerning the drive:  Prior to driving this car, the last time I drove manual trans. was half a decade ago, so I had to relearn how to drive stick, and this is where you'll experience the power.  For example: during the first month of ownership, I squealed the tires and it shot out from my stop-sign stance...WOO!!!  Do NOT let your kids learn how to drive stick on this car!  After a year w/ it, I love the drive and the horsepower it gives me to regulate on people who violate the carpool lane requirements.  The clutch is ok. Some say it's soft, but I think it's hard (maybe I need exercise)...then again, I'm a GIRL, what do I know?!  Brakes are nice and responsive.  Gas pedal is another story--blow on it w/ your mouth and you fly to the moon (obvious exaggeration but you'll get my point), so it's EASY to speed w/o knowing it.  As for shifting, it's fine for me-you know what gear you put it in, but don't try to compare it to the shifting of Audi TT's...that's just not fair.  Amazingly, you can pass up cars on the freeway in 5th gear. Overall the ride is nice and quiet; maybe a little TOO quiet

I Love: the cupholders (older models have sucky ones, these ones can hold pretty good sized soda cups); light-sensitive rearview mirror (it darkens to compensate for glaring headlights behind you, works @ night); how the moonroof closes the same way the windows close w/ the key; how it attracts guys (hey, I'm still a girl!); basically the fact it has a lot of features that my mom's 960 Volvo doesn't and costs $15K less

I Hate: climatronic-if you don't like to leave things well enough alone, you WILL get annoyed with this feature...it's meant for those who don't like to think about a/c control...must learn to not fight it and just let it do its thing & control the climate inside the car; inability to change oil myself-you can't unless you have a professional carlift system or something rivalling it because access to it is an adventure in itself; visors-they're not long enough to block the sun after 4pm for my short self...I had to buy a baseball cap to compensate for this

It could use: bigger sun visors =); standard smoke glass tinting--black ext. w/ black int. is NOT fun in sweltering heat, I need to save up for tinting; bigger gas tank-someone else mentioned this, but it's true--you're gonna waste a lot of gas because you keep driving it EVERYWHERE and refuse to stop; a different armrest-it needs a better design because it gets in the way during city driving

After having this car for a year, only two annoying-but-minor problems have come up.  Some kind of strip to prevent the car from rattling came out, but the car hasn't rattled since it came out, so I'm not concerned...yet.  Also, one of the speakers sounds like it's torn (very recent thing that just happened 2 days ago), but my car is still under warranty, so they better fix it for free (I'm not "bumpin' my trunk", so I don't know why it'd be ripped already), but otherwise this car has been good to me and I love it.  Actually I'm VERY tempted to NOT recommend getting this car because I like the fact that it's a rare fun find, but it's hard not to say how much I love this car.  

p.s. If you can drive stick, go straight for the GLX model.  You might as well (literally) get more bang for your buck.

yeah, and insurance is not cheap for this thing, so reconsider if # of points you have on your record looks like you've been playing basketball.
