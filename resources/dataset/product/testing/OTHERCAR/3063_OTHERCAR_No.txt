            Bought my '96 Dodge Intrepid used with 41,000 miles on it.  Car broke down completely at 42,000 miles on the side of the HWY going to Tucson, AZ.  Had to have the car towed.  Problem: faulty timing belt tensioner and fried the timing belt in the process of breaking down.  Took car to dealer to have it worked on because I am not from Tucson, AZ and wanted the work to be warrantied.  Boy, was I misinformed.  The cost for this work?: $900.00.  When the car was in shop, I asked them to replace the water pump because I was told Dodge Intrepids have problems with their water pump.  Dealer said, &quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it&quot;, he assured me everything was fine. Four months later, water pump broke and fried the timing belt.  Dealer here and Dodge would not warranty other dealers work.  Cost: $560.89.  Called Dodge and complained.  They would not help with any of the costs.  After talking to 5 different people at Dodge, I finally found out that my car had an incomplete recall that needed to be fixed.  Neither of the two previous dealers mentioned nor fixed that!  Now I have to take it in to the shop again to have the recall fixed.  Now, I fear driving the car especially on long trips which is the very reason we bought it.  I've also had to have the radiator flushed.  Car is always running hot and electrical problems are always occuring.  Cost of car: $11,500.00  PS: steering makes funny noises in the morning.<br><br>
