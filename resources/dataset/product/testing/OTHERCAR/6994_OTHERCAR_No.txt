            When my Dodge Stratus was due for some work at the shop, and I had to leave it overnight, I needed a rental car for a day.  I told Hertz to give me the lowest priced rental car.  They gave me a 2002 Chevy Cavalier 4 door sedan.  After driving it for a full day, here are my impressions.

EXTERIOR:

The Cavalier initially looks like a sporty car.  With a low & pointed front nose, short rear deck, and smooth lines, it is an attractive design.  I much prefer the look of the 2 door, the 4 door looks like a stodgy sedan with a sporty nose and tail.  Overall, though, I find the styling somewhat bland.  The new 2003 Cavalier has a much more aggressive and eye-catching look that I much prefer.

INTERIOR:

Climb into the Cavalier and you realize just how cheap Chevrolet makes this car.  The front seats are supportive but too hard.  The rear seats are cramped and uncomfortable, and even with 4 doors, climbing in the rear is very difficult for anybody except a small child.  The interior is very spartan, nothing but the absolute basics.  The gauges are large (almost TOO large) and readable.  The A/C controls are intuitive 3 knob design.  My car had an AM/FM/CD Player, if this deck is an extra cost option, I would have passed on it...it's the cheapest looking and sounding CD player I've seen.  The speakers sounded like they were stolen out of my daughters little boom box.  The car is noisy at just about any speed.  The trunk is small, but considering the size of the car, to be expected.  Visibility was good in all directions.

PERFORMANCE:

The Cavalier is equipped with an inline 4 and either an automatic or manual transmission.  My rental had an automatic.  The engine wasn't very powerful, but adequate for this small car.  The transmission was a little jerky when shifting.  The car handled acceptably around curves, but even for a small car like this it didn't feel too sporty.

FINAL VERDICT:

For those who have little money to spend on a car, or for parents looking for a first car for their teenager, the 2002 Cavalier might be worth considering.  Otherwise, I don't think most people will be very pleased or impressed with this car.
