            These days the push is to smaller faster sleeker consumer electronic devices, particularly in portable devices. If your number one priority is getting the smallest and lightest digital camera, the Kodak DC280 isn't for you. It is about the size of a traditional 35mm chemical camera, maybe even slightly bigger. It is noticeably heavier than my Kodak chemical camera. I was startled by its weight - it is considerably heavier than the other Kodak digital cameras I've held.

But if your goal is to get great pictures with almost no work, the DC280 is a great choice. The entire preparation process consisted of popping in 4 AAA batteries and the 8MB CompactFlash card then turning the camera on. I was taking pictures within mere minutes.

The camera will take care of automatically adjusting the focus and the flash settings, but if you prefer you can adjust them manually. The camera has a 2x optical zoom that you can use to capture images of more distant objects. There is an extensive onboard menu system for a lot of different settings. You can also preview and trash pictures that are stored from the camera itself.

The DC280 supports six different picture settings - good, great, and best at high and low resolution. At the high resolution setting, the camera provides 2 megapixels. I've been taking most of my pictures at good low resolution and they look terrific. At this setting I can fit 97 pictures on the 8MB CF card. 

The DC280 comes with both USB and serial cables but I use a USB CF reader to grab pictures from the CF card. It comes with some plugins for bringing pictures into Adobe Photoshop as well as some basic image editing software. I haven't really used the software much - I haven't needed to touch up the pictures at all.

My one major concern was battery life. Digital cameras eat batteries, or so I'd been told. They said rechargeable batteries are a requirement. Well, I'm still using my original set of alkaline batteries after taking several hundred pictures. 

I have been incredibly pleased with my Kodak DC280. It takes excellent pictures without my having to set 4000 different settings. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to buy a digital camera.
