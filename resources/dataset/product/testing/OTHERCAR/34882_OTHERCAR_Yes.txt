            We chose to purchase this car for our family because it's large, stable, and performed exceedingly well in all safety tests. We respect Honda as a durable, solid brand; not luxurious and not spartan...still well styled without being pretentious. How perfect for every family! 

We bought a car that another family had ordered but decided not to purchase, receiving it at a slightly lower MSRP. The car had a silver exterior with a beige leather interior, and had a sunroof and guided navigation system...techie amenities that are both convenient and fun. Since we are always looking for ways to keep the noise level to a dull roar on long trips, we needed a fully-stocked entertainment system...TV's built into the seat backs, headphones, to-the-degree climate control, the whole works. 

We got what we paid for.

And more.

Everything seemed to be perfect: the car had a spacious, surprisingly comfortable -- even luxurious -- interior. The overstuffed leather seats feel like ergonomically-designed massage chairs, and the lumbar support adjustment and heated-seat options are wonderful. There is plenty of legroom in every seat. The climate control worked impeccably, as did the navigation system. The televisions had poor reception, but we did have a VCR...and the movie clarity was immaculately clear, the headphones and remote control very well-designed. The sunroof let in that essential dose of crystal-cool air, creating a more pleasurable driving experience. 

The only questionable aspect of the vehicle was the automatic door system. The doors are designed to open and close automatically with the touch of a button, or just a slight jerk of the handle. However, this didn't work 100% of the time and sometimes was a burden more than a help. 

Another con was that the size of this car did not allow it to fit in our normal-sized garage. 

Altogether, though, this car earns top scores for comfort, luxury, functionality, safety, effectiveness, and just about everything else. Best yet, the price isn't horribly unreasonable for a minivan stocked with everything a family could want. 

A definite yes.
