               I purchased my Rodeo back in 1998 when the new design came out. I fell in love with it the second I saw it. The sporty design and &quot;fun&quot; look along with a powerful engine made me choose this SUV. I've had it for about 2 years now and still love it as much as I did when it was purchased. I've added all the extras and even a new 10 disk CD changer.
   I've noticed that a lot of people complain about the engine problems and I can honestly tell you that I have had no engine problems and I'm at about 40,000 miles already. I do routine oil changes, tire rotations and engine check ups which help keep problems away (or minimal). 
There are a few things I don't like though. The ride is a bit bumpy and things do get damaged easily. I had new rear wiper blades put in and now the wiper doesn't work. The paint scratches very easily and the fuel pump is very loud when the engine has been running for a while. Most things are easily fixed though. 
   I did get in one accident with my Rodeo on black ice which was quite the experience. Not to mention the damage was about $2,000 and had nothing to do with my engine. Just the front bumper and head light covers. Gas is about $25.00 per week for me using Premium Unleaded and I drive it quite a bit every day.
   I guess their really isn't such thing as a perfect car. I really do love my Rodeo. It's given me no serious problems yet and I hope to still get a few good years out of it. It is for people who like fun little cars with style and power though. If you don't, this may not be the car for you. I can just say that I love mine and that it has given me way less headache then any other car I've owned.<br><br>
