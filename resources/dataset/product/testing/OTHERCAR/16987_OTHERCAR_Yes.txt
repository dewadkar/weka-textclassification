            My family bought the MDX with Navi and Touring packages in the April of 2000. It was intended for long road trips, carrying up to 7 people and luggage, and occasionally venturing out to Tahoe for some fun in the snow. So far, it has done so in typical Acura fashion, and that is a great thing.

The Good:

Do you find the interior of some cars impractical or ugly? Do you hate it when the "in-dash" 6 CD changer really resides in the arm rest or glove compartment? Do you dislike it when there are many buttons marked with mysterious symbols? Do you find it stupid when the climate control, radio, and CD player don't line up and reside instead on different planes and sections of the dashboard? Do the thoughtless ugliness of cheap dials and buttons make you want to shout "what the heck is GM thinking?!" If you answered "yes" to any of these questions, then you are probably like me, someone who appreciates the beauty in practicality and simplicity. And if you also need a midsize SUV to carry people and sometimes drive in bad weather, you need to look at the MDX.

Let's start with the best overall interior design in the class. The center stack contains, in a straight line, the three main systems of the cabin: climate control, nav, and stereo. The climate control may be the worst element in an otherwise outstanding interior since parts of it are imbedded within the navigation screen. But after a quick scan through the instruction booklet and some random button pushing, as practical people sometimes do, you will own that sucker like nobody's business. And if the passengers in the back whine about the cabin being too hot of cold, just push a button and those whiners can control their very own climate system with AC and heat.

Looking down a little, there's the nav we paid $2k for. The navigation system interface is very intuitive, made even more so by the touch-screen design. For those good with directions, spending $2k on this option might be pointless. But having this in the car meant that we never had to pull over to check the map, we (the men) never had to ask for directions, and the voice guidance adds to the safety benefit of the system. In the long run, the nav may pay for itself with its usefulness. But you have to introspect if you really need it. There are also more stuff like trip computers and mileage calculators, which entertain passengers on long trips.

Still further down, there's the true in-dash 6 CD stereo. The system's buttons and knobs are quick studies. The volume and channel controls on the steering wheel add to the convenience. The speakers sound fine to me, although I'm not an audiophile. I advise against trying to change CD's while driving, just like I advise against talking on phone, putting on make up, or changing clothes. All of these actions are technically do-able when the car is moving, but the world would be a much better place if drivers kept their eyes on the road and don't hog the passing lanes.

So, three main systems in a column, placed in highly visible locations, where the driver and shotgun can operate everything as needed. Put in some decent quality material that don't feel like Legos and you'd have a solid foundation for a great interior. Sounds simple and logical enough, right? Nope! As we looked around in year 2000, we were able to eliminate all but one other midsize SUV based on the center stack design alone, the RX300. And that was eliminated after the test drives.

The MDX engine was simply stronger than that of the RX. And as we drove it for the past 3 years, including fully loaded up with people, skis and boards, clothes, and food, up through and around Tahoe, the engine just kept on tugging. Occasionally it downshifts to 4th gear to pull up the tough mountain highways, but it's never at a want for more power when driven within extra-legal limits. I don't know how the MDX performs at the super-duper-ultra-legal limits. :)

The handling is fine. It's a 2-ton SUV so it shouldn't be tossed around like a S2000. The visibility is good, the seat warmers feel good after snowboarding, and the trunk is enormous. In terms of reliability, I've never had to worry about the MDX. It is just rock solid.

One anecdote regarding the VTM-4 system: Over 1 foot of snow fell overnight while we were staying at a cabin in 2003. The MDX was completely snowed in. I spent an hour shoveling the white stuff, particularly making trails behind the wheels to ensure the MDX's exit. Then I hopped in, pressed the VTM-4 lock button, and backed out without a hitch. Walking back inside the cabin, I noticed that the MDX did not use the trails I made at all. It went over another part of the driveway where there was still 1/2 foot of snow. All that hard work when I could've been indoors drinking hot coco...

The Bad:

There are several faults with the first generation MDX. Let the buyer beware. The first and foremost is the wind noise. While the cabin is not very noisy, the wind is audible. We usually have the radio on, so there have been no complaints from my family. But keep an ear out and make sure you can live with the noise level.

The gas mileage ain't so hot either. On a lot of highway driving, I've gotten it up to about 21 mpg. However, in mixed city driving, that number can dip down to about 18 mpg. This is not terrible, but you need to factor in that the MDX needs premium gas, not regular unleaded. When the times are tough, the cost of owning this vehicle can escalate pretty fast.

Lastly, Acura offers some very ugly options for the MDX. The sunroof deflector is pretty nasty. The gold emblems are way too ghetto-fabulous for this vehicle. And those body panels and side steps are absolutely hideous.  While I appreciate the average and practical exterior, Acura can really look to the other automakers for some direction on appearances. 

The Ugly:

Otherwise known as the Truth... Here are a couple more things that are neither bad nor good about the MDX. 1) We've never had the pleasure of testing the airbags, seat belts, and the spare tire. Hopefully, we never will. I can testify that the emergency breaking is pretty good though. 2) It's hard to buy rack accessories since the MDX crossbars are so wide. I had to search around to find something that fits. As a matter of fact, don't buy the rip-off Acura accessories. Look around the internet for better prices. After all, we're on Epinions because we want to be smart consumers.

In conclusion, the MDX isn't as luxurious as some others. It isn't as great of a performer compared to some. It definitely isn't that cheap. But after 3 years, I know that my family couldn't be happier with our choice. More than anything else, we've come to really appreciate the thoughtful and functional interior. Most of the other traits such as power, leather, gadgets, and handling are in a perfect balance between what I really need and what I want. In fact, I think that the only car better than my 2001 MDX might be the 2004 MDX. Hm... Maybe it's time for an upgrade. :)
