            We bought a 2000 Kia Sephia because my wife was transferred 45 miles away from home, and we needed a car that gets good gas mileage and was known for its reliability. For the money, it is a well built car.It was a roomier car than the Dodge Neon, which we also looked at, and it had a 4 speed automatic transmisson instead of the 3 speed Neons. 
I like the adjustable driver seat, my wife can raise herself in the seat since she is short and i can lower myself for comfort since i am tall. The trunk is good sized and the rear split seats fold down for that extra room you sometimes need. The only problem we've had with it so far is the brake system. It seems from talking to mechanics Kia has a problem with their computer in their brake system. My wife was driving it in traffic and she could let off the gas at 20 miles an hour and stop in 5 feet without applying the brakes. One time she couldn't get the car over 15 miles an hour because the brakes wouldn't let go. When applying the brakes hard it always seems to make the car pull left, which has also been contributed to the brake system. We took it in to 3 different dealers to look at and 2 of them told us there was nothing wrong with it, the third still has it going on 3 days. Overall if they get the brakes fixed i would recommend this vehicle to anyone wanting a good gas mileage fairly roomy smaller car.    <br><br>
