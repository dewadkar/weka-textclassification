            I own a 1989 Corolla SR-5 coupe with 136,000 miles.  I don't have enough room to say nearly enough good things about this car.  I bought it in 1996, when it had 85,000 miles.  Since then, not one day has gone by that it has been inoperable.  It's been in the shop maybe a couple times for normal wear-and-tear things (tires, brakes, exhaust, oil changes....) and has never broken down on me.  After 50,000 miles of delivering pizza, driving all over St. Louis, and being a notoriously fast and reckless driver, I'd expected a few problems, but have had none.  The car gets nearly 37 mpg in the city with a 5 speed and carbuerated engine, which is outstanding.  Everything on the inside is perfect, no rattles or squeaks, and the paint looks brand new.  On the road, it's fun to drive, handles well, and is pretty quick.  On longer trips, it does fairly well for being such a small car, and has no problems hovering at 90- 100mph on the highway.  For being ten years old this car still has attractive styling, and the interior shows no indication of being designed in the 80's.  Bascically, if you want a ridiculously dependable and fun car, buy one of these, you won't be sorry.

p.s. the only bad thing is that the mechanics and managers at the Toyota dealers are very rude, expensive, and slow -- don't go to one if you can help it. <br><br>
