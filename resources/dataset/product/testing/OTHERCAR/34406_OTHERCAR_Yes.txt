            I am the proud owner of a brand new black 2000 Hyundai Tiburon.
This is the first car that I have ever bought new, I have had it for about 2 months and I couldn't be happier.  My Tiburon came loaded with sunroof, ice blasting AC (my first car with A/C), CD player, with awesome premium sound... awesome for factory speakers anyway.

I will admit that at the time I bought the car that I really wanted silver or blue, but could not find one with the options that I desired.  So I ended up getting the black one and now in hindsight this was not a bad thing to settle for, in fact I am glad I got &quot;stuck&quot; with the black one.  From the inside, the car looks like the Batmobile, no seriously with its curves on the sides, and the raised area above the headlights.  For looks alone, this is one sharp looking car!  You would not believe how many people stop and turn their heads to look at my car as I drive by.
Not many people have a Tiburon so people ask and they want to have one too.  Even the interior cloth seats have a crazy black and grey design. 

Dont let the dealer nail you though, the one I went to would not go below 19000 for the car, when MSRP is 13000.  I could have fought it, but I was too excited to get my first new car.  But for you, haggle, haggle, haggle, don't let them sell this to you for more than 15000.  Just print out online price quotes and bring them in to the dealership with you, it will be hard for them to argue with you. 

This car is extremely quiet too.  When the windows are up, you don't hear much in the way of engine noise, even at higher speeds.  The shock system is made with McPherson gas filled struts.  If you are looking for a great looking car that is under 20k that runs well this car is for you.  I just wish they would come out with a convertible!
