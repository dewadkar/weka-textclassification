            Model: 3.3L V6

I bought this car for $5000 CDN with 220,000 KM on it.  The A/C was completely disabled from the beginning.  (the belt was not hooked up to the compressor, I am assuming that the A/C died on the previous owner.  The A/C compressor cooling fan was seized as well.  

I'll list the problems I have had with it first.

1. During a routine oil change the mechanic noticed that the transmission cooling lines (???) were sweating.  Not sure what that was but it was fixed under the 30 day bumper to bumper warranty.  No cost to me.  

2. Car overheated one day.  Puked coolant all over the place.  Was the coolant leak the cause of the over heating, or did it over heat and cause the coolant to leak.  I don't know.  (I'll exclude the $200 that I was scalped for at Canadian Tire just to tell me that they couldn't figure out why it over heated because that was not entirely the car's fault).  After that it started making a moaning noise.    Ultimately it turned out to be the water pump that was failing.  It seized up on me just as I was pulling in to my driveway.  $45 CDN for the pump.  I fixed it myself, easy repair even for a novice.  

3.  Rear brake rotors and pads, Front brake rotors and pads and a new rear caliper.  I had the rear repaired in January then the front in April.  $400 CDN each time.  Those were just routine.  Considering the age I have had relatively few problems.  Knock On Wood.

Now for the good.

For a 6 cylinder it gets good gas mileage.  I was able to go 480 KM on about 50 Liters of gas.  That&#146s road trip highway driving.  In town its pathetic.  maybe 100-200 km with the same 50L.

Very roomy and comfortable.  Lots of trunk space.  Well thought out spare tire.  No extra tools required to change a tire.  

Good handling and good acceleration.  Keep it in 3rd when in town and it has the best performance.
