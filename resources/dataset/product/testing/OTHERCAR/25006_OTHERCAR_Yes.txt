            <b> Intro </b>

Hello folks! Been a while since I last wrote but here I am. And as promised I have returned proudly with my learner&#146s permit. Didn&#146t do too shabby if I may add. Back on topic. 

About 4 months ago my father purchased and nearly brand new (50 mi.) VW Beetle. And to my family&#146s surprise, it fit the needs of my dad&#146s commuter lifestyle. He calls it his sports-car. I called it a shapely economy-car. That is, until I took the wheel.

<b> First impressions </b>

At first sight of this bulbous bug, you can&#146t help but do a double-take. It catches your eye and holds its attention well with its smooth curving lines and bulging front and rear. 

Take a step inside and the surprises continue as the interior is incredibly roomy accommodating even the tallest of drivers. The materials are well made and fitted to the dash. The stylish three spoke steering wheel makes a statement as does the mesmerizing red glow of the central instrument console.

But as stated before these are just the most stand out features of the bug. Perhaps a little more detail about the interior/exterior features hmm?

<b> Exterior options/details </b>

Most likely the most standout feature of this cars exterior is its shapes. The smooth lines eloquently combined with sophisticatedly molded body panels hints at the Beetle&#146s relation with the Audi design. Equipped with the GLS trim are front fog lamps placed deep within the front bumper. Strategically placed low to the ground to cut cleanly through the thickest of fog while avoiding blinding other drivers. Smart move on VW&#146s part.

Also equipped with the GLS beetle are rear rain guards place just aft of all four wheels. These assist in cutting down of the amount of mist thrown into the air on rainy days.

<b> Exterior Gripes!! </b>

We ran into problems with the exterior in terms of ride-height with the beetle. Sporting and athletic low riding stance while being cosmetically pleasing is not fit for rough road conditions. In fact, simply exiting the driveway results in scratching and screeching of the bottom of the front and rear bumper panels. As said before, this is a &#147gripe&#148 and has yet to cause any formidable problems with the cars performance. It is quite nerve-racking though!

<b> Interior details </b>

The interior was also a pleasant surprise and quite comfortable. The first thing that comes to mind when you sit down is most obviously the plush seats. They&#146re slightly elevated from the floor of the car and are nicely buckets to keep you firmly in position. But, the head rests were a completely different story, terribly uncomfortable. And the choosing of seat positions proved to be a taxing job. But allow me to save my rant for the gripes section.

Something the Beetle is most certainly not lacking is interior space. Tall drivers are welcome equally as shorter drivers. An area where many economy cars come up short. Cargo space is also quite impressive despite the small exterior appearance. Two scooters, a guitar, a six disk CD changer, and one umbrella fit neatly with useable space for more.

From the driver&#146s perspective, everything in the interior is very&#133&#133driver friendly. Namely the enormous windshield! During my test drive I failed to notice any blind spots what so ever. The radio proved simple to operate in terms of setting favorite channels and surfing. But the lack of a CD player surprised me, in a very disappointing way. A six disk CD change is a suggested option.
The central instrument panel was not only easy to read but almost soothing. While I&#146ve never driven in the dark, I have rode late at night with my father and the red glow of the console is quite mesmerizing, keeping your eyes on the road my be the harder task at hand. (Slight exaggeration) This same glow continues on to the radio controls making them easy to read on the darkest of nights.

Finally, a little something worth mentioning is definitely the climate control. You see for four years (no exaggeration what-so-ever) I have lived in an A/C-less family. Both cars were lacking any form of it. And to have A/C now is surely a blessing. The temperature of the air outside is displayed on a small panel just above the windshield as is the time. I&#146m sure few can relate but to me, air conditioning is a luxury completely foreign. Stop laughing!

<b> Interior Gripes &#145o plenty! </b>

Yes, several small pet-peeves were found in the interior. But where to start!?

Certainly the most petty of gripes was the lack of comfort in the head rests. The design is intriguing but in the long run, the idea doesn&#146t work. You see there is a very large opening in the head rest. One would assume you would fit the back of your head inside this opening. Well this approach created painful pressure-points in the head. But there&#146s really no comfortable way to make good use of the head rest and they&#146re overall very uncomfortable. Better luck next time VW.

Another small gripe was the seat position adjustment. In some ways the controls are useful. In many they are not. Allow me to explain. When going on long road-trips, don&#146t you ever feels the need to recline and take a good nap. Well, I do. And I am accustomed to a lever system allowing me to recline in seconds. But with the Beetle, you&#146re given a little dial and one full revolution equal about two inches of reclining. To fully recline yourself would take a bit. But I can&#146t stress this enough, these are &#147gripes&#148 and most were not significant enough to lower the score.

Finally, I must complain about the 6-disk CD changer. I just can&#146t grasp the reason why it was placed in the rear. This means that after installation, anytime you want to change your CD, you have to pull over, get out the CD&#146s, make the change, and then return to driving. Annoying at times? Yes. Significant enough to lower the overall score? Not at all.

<b> Ride and Handling/the big first test drive </b>

Alright, I&#146ve pestered many of you with petty gripes and so on, but as any true driver would know, this is where it counts. This is the category where decisions are made and deals are set. And it is for this reason that I made sure to run my dad&#146s beetle into the ground for one day straight. These are the results.

Engine: This is what makes the car. The engine. The specs for the GLS trim engine are as follows.

Engine: Inline 4 cylinder 2.0 L DOHC (double over head cam)
Max out put: 115 BHP
Tranny: 5 speed manual transmission


<b> The test drive: </b> 

three weeks after the acquiring of my learner&#146s permit, I was awarded permission to drive my Dad&#146s beetle around about my community.

With a turn of the switch-blade style key, a soft muffled exhaust note erupted from the muffler. And from the very start, confusion ensued. The gate for the manual transmission has a strange order of reverse in the far top left where 1st should normally be. A minor problem requiring some adjustment and we went off for a nice drive. This proved to be the last of our tranny problems.

Coming around turns gracefully with great precision, the beetle rode smoothly though my blocks two S-turns. I noticed very little roll and pitch of the body as I cut through the first turn. The wheels stayed glued to the pavement as I cruised at 20 about mph. The power assisted steering guided me through the first 90 degree turn onto the main road of my community and obediently corrected my slight over steer into the grass. 

I was now faced with a nice long straight full of smooth pavement. This is where the VW Beetle began to truly impress. I press firmly on the gas as I moved from first to second gear. The height of the cars power-band was from about 4000-6000 rpm&#146s. The torque is at it&#146s greatest within this area creating stunning acceleration which pressed my chest firmly into my seat. The car loses some of this acceleration around 7500 rpms when my dad recommended I switch gears to third.

Zipping around the community I realized just how smooth and quiet the Beetle&#146s ride truly is. Our roads in Pine Ridge are seldom paved yet the beetle suspension seems to absorb every imperfection in the road. This may be due to the 16&#148 wheels which unlike my mothers 17&#146s&#148 on the mini seem to stabilize the car in rough terrain.

Unfortunately, the low ride high as stated before causes scratches on the bumper in the rear and front and I noticed this after hitting a significantly deep pothole, which I do not consider your average &#147imperfection in the road&#148
	The final test of the little Beetle bug was a fierce one indeed, for a driver of my skills at least. After taking a cruise down to retrieve the mail, the beetle was presented with the daunting task of climbing the steepest hill in my community. 

But to my surprise, the Beetle did not wheeze and hiss its way up the incline but courageously charged upward in first gear reaching the top at about 6500 rpms in first. BRAVO! That was all it required have me attached to this little car, a bond which I had failed to perceive at the beginning of my drive. There truly is the soul of a sports car in this Bug.

My overall impression of the Beetle, while showered with gripes, was a positive one indeed. VW has earned both the respect of me and my dad. And for that, the Beetle scores above average. Yet in honesty, this Beetle deserves something closer to 4.5 .
