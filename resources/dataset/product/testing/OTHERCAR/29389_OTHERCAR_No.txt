            As my family got bigger, going to grandma's, and for those tedious summer road trips, we needed a better, bigger and reliable car.  

How WRONG we were to pick the MPV.  

Well, lets start with the few good points. 

1.  Roomy - it seats the 7 people, but you are albe to squeeze an extra in.  the back seats fold in, if you need extra cargo room.  

2.  Speakers - I happen to think it has a great speaker system, theres speakers back and front, and the resonance is awesome, great for booming your slim shady lp. 


Ok here's some big bad points. 

1.  As the years progressed, the car really showed it's age... 
Either a ghost overtook our car... or it really is a piece of freaky junk.  LISTEN TO THIS ! - The lights started to go on and off, without anyone touching it.  not flickering but whenever it felt like it, they turned on, the middle of the night, during the day, even when nobody was in the car !  And the battery ran out after awhile of the freaky lighting buisness.  How odd is that?

2.  Milage is not very good.  Not as bad as some of those SUV's, but its not the best. 

3.  The shock absorbing system, or the lack of it, is also a horrid problem, the car, when approaching bumps, hops up and down, and bounces you all around .  After we got it fixed, it got a little better, but it still bounces like hell ! 

4.  LIsTEN TO THIS TOO ! -  there seems to be may electrical problems with the car, such as, about couple years into the car, everytime we turned on the window washer squirter fluid, the lighting system short cuircuted, and we had to install anther fuse, it happened everytime, now we just don't use the washter fluid, guess we just backed away from that one.  

It is fairly easy to drive, but on occasion, because it is bulkier than those normal cars you may, like my father back into light poles, but that may be just my father.  A little getting used to will do , for those that are normal.  

Do you need room? but still have a practical family car,then this is pretty good for you. 

have fun !
