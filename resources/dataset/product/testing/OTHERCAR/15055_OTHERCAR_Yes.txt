            I absolutely love my Sony!! I use it all the time!! I help out my parents with it for taking inventory of the antiques we have. I also use it for my websites and for sending pictures to my friends that live out of state. It's light, so it can go anywhere. It has different functions for different lighting, so I can easily change from inside to outside, or if the light is in front of me or behind me. It's great at things like family picnics b/c you can take as many pictures as your disk can handle and if you make a mistake b/c someone wasn't looking or looking goofy you can just delete it right away and re-take the picture. I put together a neat webpage to show family after our reunion this summer w/ the pictures I took w/ the Sony. Everyone loved how they turned out, how clear they were. And it's really easy to make copies for other people and it doesn't cost anything b/c all you have to do is print multiple copies.

I really like how it's always ready to go when I need it. I love to photograph awesome sunsets and since they don't usually stay for very long, I can just grab the Sony and take as many shots as I need and see the results right away. My only complaint is the resolution of the preview screen isn't as accurate as what actually comes out. Many times, especially sunset pictures, they come out darker on the preview screen than what is shown on my computer screen, so it's a judgement call. But that really only applies to really dark settings, and most pictures are taken in brighter light. <br><br>
