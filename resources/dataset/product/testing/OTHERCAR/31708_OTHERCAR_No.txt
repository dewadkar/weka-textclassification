                 I have noticed that all of the reviews about the 1990 Mercury Sable on this site are glowing so I had to respond to my side of the story.  The Sable was my first car when I turned 16 about 6 years ago.  It was bought used for a decent price and handed down to me.  My father bought another Sable (a '92 I believe) a little while later and both of us had so many problems that those cars are out of our possesion forever.

     The first real problem with the Sable is the terrible rusting.  It seems that all the Sables I see rust straight through in the trunk and bottom of the doors.  Even with treatment, the rust always came back.  The car was even in the garage for years and still had the problem.  Then came the real trouble.

     My first year of college had me stuck on the side of the road at least 4 times with that crazy car.  There was some kind of engine/transmission/electrical/steering problem that they never could really explain.  Basically I would be driving along the highway and suddenly I would lose all control of the vehicle.  It would keep moving at a certain speed but you could barely steer it and the accelerator wouldn't work.  Eventually the brakes would allow me to slow down enough to pull over.  I spent months driving in the right hand lane in fear of dying in traffic.  It would then have a hard time starting until finally it didn't start again.  The problem was "fixed" a few times but never really.  Very strange and very dangerous.  The air conditioner is also a problem with every Sable I've ever seen.  It dies and can't be fixed for under a million dollars (well it's close to that).  

     Even though the car nearly killed me several times, it was still hard to part with.  The car is so roomy and easy to drive.  My father's Sable had the same air conditioning and rust problems but he had a different set of problems as well.  Numerous electrical problems and problems with the wire that connects the alternator to the battery were there.  He also had to get a new transmission.  Buy at your own risk.
