            I had initially ordered a PT Cruiser from Chrysler and when, after 6 months of waiting, I was told it would take at least another 7 months for it to arrive, I immediately cancelled the order and continued again down the dark road that is New Auto Purchasing.

I had never seen the Pontiac Aztek, until I was walking through the local mall. &quot;This is the ugliest vehicle I have ever seen&quot;, I said to myself, but my girlfriend, always willing to give a second chance, said &quot;You should find one to test drive and see what it's like.&quot;  I found a red Aztek at our local Pontiac GMC dealer and tested it out, I fell in love.  The ride is smooth the interior is spacious and the seats are extremely comfortable.  I also liked the fact that all of the controls were easy to reach, and the instrument read-outs were easy to read also.  

The outside of the vehicle does take a little getting used to but it definitely does grow on you, and amidst my friends and co-workers telling me what had already been my first impression, giving them a ride in it usually changed their minds.

Another feature I liked most about the Aztek, is the camping package.  Being an avid outdoorsman this vehicle is the perfect blend of functionality and comfort. The tent is easy to set up and the air mattress is easy to inflate and fits perfectly into the rear cargo area.

If you are in the market for a new vehicle I definitely recommend the Pontiac Aztek for its comfort and clean ride. I bought it and I love it
