            I've wanted a Wrangler since I was a little kid.  And I mean about 3 or 4 years old.  My dad had an old CJ7 that we would go 4-wheeling in, take it out in the snow, on the beach, in the mud, just about anywhere.  The year after I graduated from high school the car I was driving at the time, an 87 Blazer, started breaking down a lot, especially on my way to take an important exam at the university (I swear that Blazer was plotting to make me flunk out!).  So my parents and I started discussing what kind of car I wanted, and I immediately said a Wrangler.  I hadn't even driven one yet, so my dad (who works at a Jeep dealership in the service department) brought one home for me to test drive.  I fell in love instantly!  I'm a short person, so I like being in a car where I feel a bit taller than everyone else.  Jeep had also taken a year off (there aren't any 1996 Wranglers) of production to improve the safety of the Jeep, so that added some security while driving it.  About a month later I found myself at the dealership picking out which one I wanted, and then signing my first lease.

I chose a Wrangler Sport, Gunmetal color.  The Gunmetal is the bluish-grey that you see on 97 and older Wranglers and 98 and older Cherokees.  Unfortunately Jeep discontinued the color for some reason.  I also decided to go with an automatic.  I made this decision for 2 reasons.  The biggest reason being that I have problems with my right elbow, which would make shifting a little difficult for me.  Also, I'm in a lot of stop and go traffic, and the salesman recommended that I go with an automatic since I drive mostly in the city.

The biggest thing that I loved about driving a Wrangler is that it's an SUV so I had offroad capabilities, but it was compact enough so that it was easy to manuver into small spaces (comes in handy when trying to squeeze into the last parking place on campus!).  The most fun part though was being able to drive with the top off.  I had a soft top, so whenever the mood hit me I could have the top off of the Jeep within minutes!  It takes a little practice, but once you get used to it it's simple to take the top off and put it back on.  If I, a 5'0&quot; girl, can do it anyone can! Also, Wrangler drivers tend to stick together.  How often do you see people driving in the same type of cars, say 2 people driving a Honda Civic, waving at each other?  That's what Wrangler drivers do!  There's even a standard set for who waves first...the person in the older Jeep waves first, then the newer Jeep waves back.  If both Jeeps are the same year, the muddier one waves first.  I'm not making that up! 

This past June the lease ran out on my Wrangler, and I had to make a very difficult decision.  I'm about to graduate from college and will be getting married within the next year, so the small Wrangler was starting to be not so practical anymore.  It was one of the hardest decisions I ever had to make, but I turned the Wrangler in and leased a Cherokee.  The good thing is that I was able to stay within the Jeep family.  But I still miss my Wrangler dearly, especially on warm and sunny days!<br><br>
