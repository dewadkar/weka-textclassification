             I bought this camera as an impulse purchase, but unlike most such purchases I have no regrets. It takes the best pictures I've seen from a 
 moderately priced camera, and I can't believe the detail I get in night shots. I took pictures of the last lunar eclipse, and I was able to zoom right in and get all the details, even the clouds near it. It has a low battery life, and I would strongly recomend buying a battery charger and 8 rechargeable batteries making the only negative feature a positive. <br><br>
