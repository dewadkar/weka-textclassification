            The Nissan Sentra was my first experience with a foreign car manufacture.
I have not been disappointed with my choice.  I wanted a vehicle that was at a fair price and offered excellent fuel economy.  I drove a number of vehicles, but settled for the Nissan Sentra.

The Sentra is an easy car to drive. It handles well even in inclement weather conditions.  Its front wheel drive pulls the vehicle through snow and muddy conditions with ease.  

The interior of the Sentra is designed for comfort and practicality.  The driver and front passenger seats are designed with the passenger in mind. The rear seat has an arm rest in the center that allows for access to the trunk compartment.  This can be convenient when traveling with children.  The color schemes are of a combination of bright and dark colors adding to the attraction of the vehicle.

Nissan designed the electronic system with simplicity in mind.  The console controls are easy to operate and doesn't require a degree in physics.  This push button and go concept is one of the Sentra's best attractions.  This doesn't mean the electronics are of inferior quality. 

The fuel economy is excellent in both the city and highway.  The fuel ejection system provide for exceptional &quot;Pick-Up&quot;.     

I hit a deer while traveling at a significant speed.  This deer was one-hundred fifty pounds.  I was amazed at the little amount of damage.  I had a small dent in the front bumper that was replaced at a moderate cost.  I learned the Sentra is build with a strong frame and is designed to allow for maximum absorption from impacts.

The Sentra may not be a car for a family with two or more children.  Its compact interior does not allow for leg space adults or teens in the rear seats. 

The Sentra is not a car that appeals to the younger generation.  Although an ideal car for a collage student it doesn't fit into the  &quot;sporty&quot; category.

The Sentra offers exceptional performance and options for the price.  This vehicle is constructed with a strong frame and a simple to use concept.  The limited leg space in the rear seat and its lack of a &quot;Sporty&quot; look considered so important by the young is no reason not to consider buying this vehicle
