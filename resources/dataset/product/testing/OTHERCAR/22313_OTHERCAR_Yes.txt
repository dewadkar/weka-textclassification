            When you think of BMW what do you think of? Your probably thinking luxury, speedy, made in Germany, and EXPENSIVE. When I think of BMW I think of the new Z8 that they just put out. Who would not want a car that is made by BMW. Their a quality car dealer with high quality cars. 

The Z8 is one of the fastest cars that BMW makes in their 2000 line up. The Z8 takes the place of the 507 sport. The Z8 comes with a Gentrag Type D six-speed manual transmission. It is equipped with a 8 cylinder, 4.9 liter, 394 horsepower engine. Now that is what I'm talking about a real engine made by a real car company. This is a engine made for pure speed.

You want to race against a car that can do 0-60 in 4.5. Fine, but I can guarantee unless you have nitrogen rocket boosters on the back of your car, your not going to beat it. You press the accelerator down a little and you will be going 60 in a 25 mph zone. This car has power. I was in it for my first time, and take it from me, it is not like any other car. This is a car made to be driven with someone that loves danger.

The ride is dead quiet and you can listen to the radio on your peaceful ride home. If you want to cruise home, the Z8 has a sensor that as the wind gets more powerful the radio automatically goes louder. This is also a car that is made for safety. That is the main focus for these cars these days. If it is not safe then who wants it.

The Z8 goes for around 130,000 dollars which is definitely to expensive. I'm not saying it is not worth the money because it is but it is to much. I would compare this car to the Porsche because they look alike if you look at them at the same time. I think the BMW has a better engine, and is more stylish but the Porsche takes it in price.

When you pass by someone with this car they look at you like your a king. Sometimes they even come up to you and ask you where you got it. It makes you feel like you won the lottery but all you did is buy a BMW.

I promise that when you pass by people with this car they will notice you.<br><br>
