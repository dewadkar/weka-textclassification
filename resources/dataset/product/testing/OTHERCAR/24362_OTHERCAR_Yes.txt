            I needed a high-quality camera for my line of work.  So I decided to try out a Sony DSC-F55.  The very first day, I took a total of 53 pictures.  I downloaded them all onto my computer, and now I have them all on file, without any negatives or having to wait at Walgreens for an hour and scanning them.  It is alot quicker and convenient.  The quality of the pictures is amazing, also.  You can choose different options for the picture (eg. antique).  I would highly suggest this camera to anyone who loves to take pictures.  It is also the perfect gift to give to yourself.<br><br>
