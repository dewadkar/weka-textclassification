            Ignore all the digital SLR wannabees and save the small extra cash required for this one. Anyone who has ever used a Canon SLR (even those as far back as the A1) will feel instantly at home with this camera.

The time to get up and running and take your first picture is minimal - it looks like an SLR camera and it behaves like an SLR camera. It can take any of the Canon EOS lenses or flashes so you can make use of equipment you may already own.

Images are incredible, color depth and clarity are stunning, 10x8 prints are virtually indistinguishable from 35mm generated prints. The images are huge though - the 16MB CF card supplied is woefully inadequate (especially considering the almost $2000 price tag). The CF slot will take one of IBM's 340MB or 1GB CF hard drives though making it a little more usable.

The Camera is stacked with features that enable anyone from the point and click to the professional to use it. Full automatic to full manual operation is available, with many semi-auto modes being available.

The flash operation goes beyond that of most digital cameras in that it offers full TTL (Through The Lens) operation, this gives total flash control and allows for expansion to higher grade flash devices though the EOS flash system.

Computer hook up is very simple and the USB connection provides for high speed transfer of images.

One final point is that it is a camera first and all else second - no matter what you are doing with the D30, if you need to take a picture point - zoom and hit the shutter button, it will always take a picture above all else.
