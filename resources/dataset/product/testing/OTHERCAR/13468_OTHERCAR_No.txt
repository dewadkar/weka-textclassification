            When I pick out a car, I want one I wear, not drive.  I don't 'push' my clothes forward and I'm not going to experience the same thing when I'm driving.

So when I test-drove a 92' Geo Storm I thought I had found it.  It drove well, everything seemed to be working, it hadn't even hit the lot yet (it still needed a wash from the previous owner).  So I took it.

The car, as a car, is ok.  Adequate mileage.  Adequate speed.  Looks ok.  In the year I've had the car I've had few problems with the car mechanically. The problems I've had were due to the old owner or a local tire company that I was warned about (but I had a coupon...!  Doh!)

The problems I do have with it stem from the same thing that got me to buy it.  It fits like a suit.  You sit down and join the car.  That�s good.  Ever try to have your suit hold a large McDonald's soda?  The car can't either.  

It isn't built for the comfort of passengers, its built for a driver.  And that�s about all that comfortably can sit in it.  The back seat is for emergency use only.  Though it does fold down to a rather roomy hatch.

The 'cockpit' feel they were going for in the windshield wipers and lights leaves a little to be desired.  Rather than putting them on a stick off the steering column, they're buttons lining the sides of your panel display.  Not a big deal, but you do have to remove your hand from the wheel to use them.  That and the fact that there is no delay feature for wipers.  Really annoying in a drizzle.

They also tried to put a little triangle of glass as a makeshift window for the passengers in back.  Not that anyone willingly <i>be</i> a passenger in back.  The frame around this glass, however, is my real problem with it.  Its big, and think, and just wide enough to fill my blind spot.  Really annoying.

Then we get to the heater.  It has two settings hot, and warm.  Even when it's off I still feel it blowing.  

The angle of the windshield blows the defroster right into the face of the front passenger.  So they'll constantly be reaching over and shutting it off until you yell at them because you can't see.

And why cant you see?  Because the windows fog up faster than any car I've ever been in.  For some reason that currently escapes me the car also frosts on the INSIDE.  I've seen this happen rarely in my friend�s cars, but it happened almost every day this last winter in mine.  

So in the end, the car is ok.  Just not a road trip vehicle, picking up friends, or holding your drinks.  If you live alone, don't go anywhere far, and live in a warm climate you might like the car.  Otherwise, see what else is there before you decide on it.
