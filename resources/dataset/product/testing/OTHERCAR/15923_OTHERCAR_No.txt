            Cavalier at first onlook says one word and that is small.  Its a compact right it should be small.  Well Compacts can be small but still have some room in them. I gonna give you the real truth behind the cavalier 

Exterior:

The design is not to bad and it does have a sleek look to it when its in your driveway. Aerodynamics of the car look pretty decent.  Paint job was done pretty good.  But My one concern is up by the grill area the material feels very cheap and flimisie like any kind of hit off a bumper could damage it.  I think chevrolet could have worked a little on the grill area of the car it just feels to cheap and not made well.  The rest of the car has a nice hard body to it.  Other then that the entire exterior looks pretty well designed and made. 

Interior:  
 
Trunk space you can fit two full size suit cases in the trunk and a travel suit case to the side and a couple of travel bins in the more frontal are of the trunk. Trunk size for a compact is pretty good.  I think the mazada 626 might be a little bit better in the trunk space department.  But still the trunk space on the cavalier is pretty respectable and nothing to be ashamed of.  The inner cabin of the car the seats up front have a comfortable feel.  Its deffintley not a luxury type seat.  But its comfortable enough that when you sit in it your not thinking about the seat.  The passenger side i find sorta cramped the seat needs to be pushed back quite a bit if your tall.  the dashboard comes out to far on the passenger side which forces the passenger chair farther back then the drivers chair.  Drivers chair is roomy and nice as the dashboard is farther away from you.  Unfortnley its not the same for the passenger.  The Driver seat is not automatic adjusted you have to adjusted it manually with the lever they give you.  The backseat is really no more then a bench. Its semi confortable but its liviable.   A tall person would have real trouble in the back seat maybe a average size person would do ok.  Its not totally cramp in the back but its tight.  The material used on the seats its about lower mid grade.  Its ok material but I'm sure the seat material will probably wear out quicker.  

Layout of Cabin:

The speedometer is done well the dashboard is pretty lit at night with orange and red glows. The layout for the driver is perfect. Everything is where it needs to be nothing is a reach.  The console area could use some work i find it lacking in lots of areas it need to have a place for cds to be held in. In the console department theirs just a big cup holder and a little empty space for maybe sunglasses i guess.  Theirs two cup holders up front as well. Lets put it this way I'm not very pleased with the console layout.  I find it to be a little disapoointing as this could have been a nice buy for the car.  The aircondition vents are place correctly which is a plus the air condition and heat both perform extremely well.  


Electronics of the car:

I find the stereo to be disappointing the speakers could have been allot better the speakers in the high range are pretty good. But if you try to put any bass on them they start rattling and crackling. The back speakers are not made well enough to handle the lower bass and so it makes the stereo very upper range only.  The car has a cd player which is deffintley a added plus.  The layout of the stereo player i find is kinda hectic and can prove to be dangerous if your the driver trying to figure how to get the cd player on and off and change track tunes and what not.  The car comes standard with cruise control which is another plus. nothing to much to talk about the cruise control its the basic standard cruise control you see on most cars.  The gear shifter is down by the console like most foreigns are which i find to be nice because i dont like the shifter up by the wheel area. The car dosent have automatic locks nor does it have power windows. Which i find really stressing because you have to open all four doors manually which means you have to reach over to each door and open it for the person to get in.  The Car does have ABS and daylights which is a good feature to have.  I think the features could have been allot better. 

Driving and Steering.

In short The car does drive smooth and does have allot of power behind it.  It's steering ratio and radius are excellent.  I really dont have any complaints about the steering or Driving of the car.  Its smooth and confident. The only thing is when you get up around higher speeds like above 70 mph you start feeling the speed.  But this is not bad either because most compacts have the exact same feeling.  I drove the car up to a 110 mph and it handled fine and without a problem.  I think the gear ratio could have been just a little bit better. The automatic transmission can be undecided at times as far as what gear to be in when going up mountains or when you slowly start adding more gas when going up a moutain.  Although this does not effect performace i just think the gear ratio could have been just a little bit better.   

Conculsion 

Sometimes i wonder if the car was made for renta car use or for the consumer. In general the car is ok.  I would probably go to the mazada 626 with the v6 engine.  I think you will get more bang for your buck with the mazada 626 then the cavalier.
