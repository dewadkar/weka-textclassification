            All right...this car is a little subcompact machine...that looks good.  Well, atleast used to.  Have you seen those awesome supped up civics out there.  They used to do it with the old ones a couple years back.  They looked so freaken bad azz.  I mean, they had phat tinted windows, new shiny chrome rimms and all sorts of different accessories.  You can do it now, but it doesnt look as good.  I mean the car is great: it drves well, its cheep...and..WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT??  Its cheep!!!  If you are looking for a nice car, that drives well, can &quot;possibly&quot; be supped up, and is really really cheep..then go for the Honda civic.  Honda makes great cars.  You can rely on them and not worry about you breaking down in the middle of the road. The bad part is that a whole lot of people have these cars...so don't be disappointed if yours is not the only phat civic on the road.<br><br>
