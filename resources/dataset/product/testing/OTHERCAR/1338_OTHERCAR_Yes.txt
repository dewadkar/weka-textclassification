            I have to be honest, I didn't buy this vehicle my parents did while they were visiting me for a month and a half. Even though I did drive 3500 out of the first 5000 miles on it. 

What exactly they bought was a Silverado 1500, Automatic Transmission, crew cab, with 4x4, fully loaded with tow package.

This truck was a dream to drive, it handled as well as any sports sedan I've driven (BMW &amp; mustang) and if the view out the wind shield wasn't so high up I would have sworn I was in a Lincoln.The room inside  was roomy enough for four LARGE adults and average 11 year old boy. 

It did as well as a commuter vehicle as it did hauling all my belongings to my new apartment. For a truck of it size it did well on fuel consumption 16 mile to the gallon loaded down with the bed full, and 18 in town, 21 highway, 22 with cruise control on. 

Basically, I now long for an upgrade of my truck, a plain ole '88 chev 1500. But until I can Afford $700 Dollars a month 
for a vehicle, Ill be bouncing down the road in its 2 wheel drive grandaddy.<br><br>
