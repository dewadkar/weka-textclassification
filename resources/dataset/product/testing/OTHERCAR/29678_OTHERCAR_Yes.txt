            My 14 year old son was excited about my recent new car purchase. When I brought it home the look of disappointment on his face was abvious. How was he going to explain to his friends that his &quot;cool&quot;, &quot;younger than his years&quot; dad brought a Buick?!
Fear not. Once I got past the name, the car is a blast to drive! Supercharged V-6 that does 0-60 mph in 6.6 seconds, Monsoon sound system w/8 speakers through 200 watts, sunroof, Gran Touring Suspension, 16&quot; chrome wheels, sharp interior. Except it says Buick on the outside.
The car is fast. The stereo is awesome. The handling is good, not great but better than the cruise ship ride of past Buicks. 
Minor flaws: leather could be better quality, gas mileage stinks (my driving habits might have something to do with that).
Now if only I could get the exhaust to sound throatier, hmmm...reminds me of my muscle cars of the 60's. Oh well, just a thought.<br>
<b>Purchase Price:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;$27,000
