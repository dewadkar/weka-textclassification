            I purchased a Honda Accord Coupe LX over the winter because my other Honda Accord broke down. I buy Hondas because they are reliable and inexpensive. They also look attractive. It has everything you need in a car. Well, I bought my Accord for $21,000 which is a great price. I really wanted to get the V-6 but I didn't have an extra $3,000 to spend. I am really satisfied with this car. It is smooth and has the best mileage. The seats are also comfortable, you can adjust the seats in just a snap. I feel that I should of bought the sedan instead of the coupe because it is really inconvenient when you have to get to the back seat. the reason why I chose the coupe over the sedan was because it was more stylish. I really emphasize that you think about getting an Accord for the convenience instead of the looks.<br><br>
