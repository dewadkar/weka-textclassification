            Just picked up this baby a couple weeks ago (May 2002) and can't find enough reasons to go out for a drive.  I bought the 1.8L Turbo GLS with a manual transmission (I'd avoid the rather gutless 2.0L standard engine).  Options included on mine are the sport/luxury/cold weather packages (heated seats rock!) w/black leather interior.  It has plenty of power which is amplified by its relatively light weight and handling is just superb for a car in this price range.   Turbo response is decent at lower rpm's and excellent at the higher end.  Interior styling is excellent: very sharp, clean, and for the most part, smart.  Be sure to test drive one at night to check out the dash lighting!  VW delivers such a great balance in its design, inside and out, without going overboard like so many Japanese models.  (Am I the only one who hurls when I see a Subaru Outback?)  OK, so VW's do tend to be pricier than other cars in their respective classes, and the Jetta Wagon is no different in that respect, but that money hardly wasted as VW pours it into all the great styling and safety features made so famous by the Germans.

The few complaints I have are relatively minor.  The center armrest does not have enough storage space for my needs and gets in the way a bit when shifting (it can be raised out of the way if necessary).  The retractable cupholders on the dash are a bit flimsy and when using them, some stereo controls are blocked, but there are duplicate controls on the steering wheel which minimizes the effects of this flaw.  Also, the sun visors and side mirrors could be a bit larger (I have a '99 Beetle with the same problem).  I also wish that it had a 6th gear like the Passat.  Cruising at higher speeds in 5th can run the engine over 3000rpm which no doubt affects fuel economy.  

Another issue: with the rear seats folded down, the driver's seat has to be moved forward to a position that might be uncomfortable for taller drivers.  In general, this is probably not a car that persons much over 6' would be comfortable in, especially on long drives.  Other than the huge cargo area, this definitely is not a big car.

Even with these problems, I still love this car to death.   There aren't many on the road, so you'll probably have the only one on your block and will turn plenty of heads!  I highly recommend the sport package with the larger (17") wheels as they greatly add to the car's performance and good looks!  Also, get the windows tinted to block the damaging sun and heat (and prying eyes) that all those windows let it!
