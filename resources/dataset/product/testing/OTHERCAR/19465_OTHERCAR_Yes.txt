            I have recently bought this Sony mavica camera and I like it a lot.  This camera has been very easy to use since you can use it with a floppy for the computer and the pictures are fantastic.

COMPATIBLE:
-The Sony mavica is very compatible.  Its compatible with windows 3.1, Windows 95, windows 4.0, or some Macs

OFFERS:
This Camera offers a built in zoom that makes it very helpful to take pictures from far away.  The Max resolution is 0.3 mega pixels.  This camera is also in a shape that makes it convenient for you.  There are also easy steps of loading you pictures onto a floppy so you can put it on you computer.  This camera is a lot easier to use than so many other digital cameras out there.  I have used a lot of different cameras for photography when I was in school and they werenï¿½t nearly as good as this Sony mavica is.   


EFFECTS:
-Negative art
-Pastel
-Sepia
-Black and white
-Color

I really like this camera and I would recommend that anyone who is thinking about buying a digital camera that they think about buying the Sony mavica.  This camera is easy to use and has everything you could possibly need in a digital camera.
