            The Chevrolet Blazer is thought to be a middle range sport utility vehicle.  That it is but for the price you can do much better.  The Blazer does not handle well in the snow even with the 4 wheel drive. I have experienced that when cornering i have fish-tailed many a time.  If you enjoy a rough ride, where you can feel any slight crack in the road, the Blazer is for you.  I feel more like I'm driving an AM General Hummer than i do a Chevrolet.  For the price and options that you can obtain for a similar price I would recommend the Ford Explorer. The Ford Explorer has better options, gas mileage, and road traction for the same price range.  The Blazer on the other hand had a nicer interior and electronic dashboard which i found to be a major plus on its part.  All in all I would opt for a different sport utility in the price range of the Blazer for more options and better driving ability.<br><br>
