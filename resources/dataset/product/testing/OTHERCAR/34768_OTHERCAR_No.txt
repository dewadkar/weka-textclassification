            Lets get a few positives out in the open, this car:

- sticks to the road pretty well
- has some neat interior design touches
- 225 has good performance

Apart from these point the car is a Tonka Toy but without the reliability and with the sort of contrived styling of mid-70's Japanese design...even the Germans don't buy TTs..

So, apart from having driven these squashed bugs, what else qualifies me to go against what a lot of people consider a sharp car? Well, I have experience in different models, being driven to work and back every other day for the past three years. 35 minutes to work and 35 minutes back over a mixture of fast straight roads as well as the twisty Connecticut Routes 53, 57 and 58.

I can truly say that the car sticks to the road - but then so it should. All wheel drive, low center of gravity and suspension geometry optimized with boots in far corners - just like a sports car should be. The car is like a limpit and this part I love. If you are buying a 2000 model make sure that it had the handling package fitted. I'm sure AUDI would not call it a recall but they were taking cars away and retro-fitting the smart handling system  - you can usually tell by the color keyed spoiler added to those early cars.

 The new 225 version is fast and has the performance it should have had since day one. The 1800T is, well, ummm, best left in the VW Bug.

Now, someone at Audi needs to explain the meaning of those two areas behind the driver and passenger seats. They look a little bit like seats but in order to qualify as seats they need to have the capability to seat something. They make the back seats of a Jaguar XJS/XK8 look palatial. They are totally useless - my miniscule daughters (10 & 7) can't fit in them let alone trying to squeeze an adult there (although we did jam a colleague in there last Christmas and had fun watching this guy try to get out - think he's still in there. Anyway, enough ranting about the seats. The fact that a cow gave up its skin to produce a white elephant is something the environmentally conscious germans have to live with...

Having criticized the space I have to wholeheartedly admit that there are some neat design touches.  I still think the exterior is contrived but the way the designers have retro-fashioned elements such as the gas filler, air vents etc is stylish. Smart ergonomic designs and clever use of materials and anodized finishes means that the overall interior design (despite those seats) is classic. A really good job Mr. Audi.

Quality wise, well..the first car (1800T) was a disaster. Fuses blowing, power locks failing, you name it - it went wrong. The later car were not a problem.

All in all - I am not impressed. For the same money I bought a 1991 Porsche 911C4, a proper 2 plus 2 with fantastic reliability,great handling, timeless looks and enough room for my kids.

If buying new then again, you are really looking at a BMW Z3 or Porsche Boxter ..easy choice, why have the AUDI get the Porsche.

But...if you were in Europe you would have so much more choice. I encourage you to check out these cars as possibilities...with any luck they may be on their way thanks to some deals that GM appear to be cooking up:

Alfa Romeo GTV/GTV Spider: 
Renault Spider
Fiat Barchetta
Fiat Coupe Turbo
Opel Spider
MGF 

Not a great fan of the MG but the Italian stuff has consistently impressed the motoring journalists over and above the AUDI especially now that the quality and reliability is up to scratch....so why can't we have them here!
