            I bought a 1992 Nissan Pathfinder about 4 months ago.  It has been the best car I've ever owned.  I purchased it for $7000 and it had 107k miles on it.  It didn't have a spot on the interior or a scratch on the exterior.  The seats are very comfortable.  I really like the driving position.  It sets you kind of low and laid back, unlike many other SUVs.  
There is plenty of room in the front seats, and ok room on the back bench seat.  The back seats do fold down, which is very convenient.  The very back has enough room to haul everyday things, but if you want to haul wood or anything like that, go for something bigger.  

The looks are ok on the outside, even being as good of condition as it's in.  I think I will add bigger tires, a brush gaurd, and maybe a bug deflector.  The stock stereo system is good.  Clarion 6x9s in the back and 4x6's in the front doors.  If you replace the tape player to a good cd player, this stereo will sound  good without upgrades.  

The engine is a solid 3.0 litre V6.  It is very smooth and powerful.  The only downfall about the engine is the noise that goes through the firewall.  I guess that's common in older foreign cars.  This SUV will go anywhere and do anything.  The thing I like most about this vehicle is how solid it is.  Acceleration and brakes are smooth.  

The  5-speed manual which I have is easy to shift and provides adaquit power.  The only thing I don't like about this car is how much room there is in the very back.  With the wheel wells on the sides and 6x9 speaker moldings on top of those, there is not enough room for more than 1 weekend for a family.  But other than that, it is a great vehicle, and I would reccomend it to anyone looking at a car!<br><br>
