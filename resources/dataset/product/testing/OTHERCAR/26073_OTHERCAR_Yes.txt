            I recently purchased a Mazda Protege LX.  It was fully loaded, and I cannot begin to tell you how happy I am with this car.  It drives great, and goes with everything I wear!  The standard stereo in this car is CD with AM/FM radio.  My car came with cassette also.  The back seat is a 60/40 split and opens to the trunk for large packages.  The car is designed to go 100,000 miles before the first tune up!  Also great is the fact that it is designed to go 4,000 miles (not 3,000) between oil changes.

The only negative thing I can say is that anti-lock brakes are not standard on these cars.  Mine does not have them.  I don't really notice the difference though.

I've had my car since August, about 3 months.<br><br>
