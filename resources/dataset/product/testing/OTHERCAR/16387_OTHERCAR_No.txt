            READ THIS ONE FIRST!
For starters, I would like to give you a small description of my background to let you in on why this item receives my epinion. I co-founded an Internet media firm in 1997. We have gone through numerous amounts of equipment and I have authorized and recommended several also.

Now the epinion: This camera is satisfactory for all of you aol subscribers (family/consumer oriented). There are several drawbacks though. BATTERY LIFE. It says that you are supposed to shoot an average of 70 high quality pictures without having to replace your batteries. NOT TRUE. I shot 11 and the battery was at half-life. And then, don't try to connect this to your computer and download the images. If you do...watch a movie and come back. The serial port is just slow. SLOW.

I am not even sure that the auto-focus feature actually works!

If you are going to but a camera, here is a list of what to look for:

mega pixels
optical (NOT DIGITAL)zoom
battery life
usb connection

Good luck and happy filming!<br><br>
