            Wanted a mega-pixal camera that didn't use a floppy. Needed to be able to take lots of pictures at high resolutions. The memory stick fit the bill.
I've used my camera at the Memphis NHRA Drags and was blown away by the clarity of the pictures from long distances.
I've upgraded to a 64 Meg memory stick and using it I can get just over 100 high quality pictures, 1600x1200. Only drawback is you'll need more than one battery.
This is more camera than I need, but working at an electronics store I was able to get one at cost, still $883 bucks!!!
I've had it interfaced to computers running Win9X, Win ME, but as of yet there isn't a driver for Win2000.
This camera is for the ultimate camera buff with plenty of money to spend.
Even better than the DSC-505 which is last years model, is the DSC-505V which offers a higher res. and is a 3.4 Mega-pixal camera.
The LCD viewscreen rotates for added flexibility.
