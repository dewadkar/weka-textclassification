            I brought this car in Dec. of 98, had it delivered in Feb. of 1999.  The buying experience was very good overall; long test drive, no pressure to buy, even got a discount on the additional items I had(roll bars, headlight protectors, roof rack).

I love the styling; I think anyone who tests this car will say so.  It is the main reason I got the car, really.  I got the lightstone interior, which was especially nice.  The engine is so-so, but gets the job done.  The seating position is high, but one problem: i'm only 6'0&quot;, and when I get a comfortable driving position, I can't reach the steering wheel with ease.  But I also found this problem with the Lexus 470 I was thinking of getting as well.  Otherwise, the interior is classy, if a bit dated.  Window controls will drive you crazy at first, and are located in the center dash.  The radio is good, but wish they had a CD changer in the front like the Lexus.    

The main problem I had with the car is quality.  In 1 year, I've had the following problems: my steering keeps going off, needing a tire balance every 3 months; my steering wheel radio controls did not work, and I had to wait a month to get it fixed;  my driver side door leaks water when it rains real hard; my radio display was also wacky, so had to replace the radio, too.  While they are small problems, they add up to a lot of time spent taking the car to the dealers, and this is something one doesn't expect in a 70,000 car.

But aside from that, would I wish to have a reliable Lexus LX470 instead? No chance.  The Range Rover wins is style, substance, ride, comfort, and longevity.  Its' not as reliable, it's interior is not as advanced, it guzzles major gas, its quite loud; but every time I drive it, I feel great about owning one.  

When BMW gets the next Range Rover out with newer tech, I'll probably get one of those.<br><br>
