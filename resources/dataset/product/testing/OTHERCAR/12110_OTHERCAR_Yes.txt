            I was shopping for a SUV around 9-10,000 dollars after and long and trying search I finally found my 93 chevy s-10 blazer 4X4 tahoe LT with under 51,000 miles 8,500.  For what I paid I could not find a SUV with more options than this vehicle.

Now if you looking for a SUV this one is great but make sure its the tahoe LT with the 4.3 liter votrex engine anything other and I would not buy this vehicle.

I have been told by many different mechinces that this engine is excellent and since chevy is still using these enignes in there truck I feel good recommending it.  There is a known problem with the engine that is not a recall item and this is around 90,000 miles the fuel injectors start to leak, a dealership said it cost about $250.00 to fix and that it only happens to about 1 in 50 engines.

The interior is big and comfortable although the front seat could go back a little futher,  The LT has power seats and if you are over 6 foot you will be cramped.  The dash is all electronic with is pretty cool at night and is easy to ready.

It handles great and has very little roll with turing, the only problem that I know of is the ABS computer was recalled in 94 but if you take it to any dealer they will fix it and the previous owner has most likely done it already.  It has to do with emergency stopping the ABS lags and you feel as if you have no brakes at all!

Like I said I havent owned this vehicle very long but so far I really like it.
