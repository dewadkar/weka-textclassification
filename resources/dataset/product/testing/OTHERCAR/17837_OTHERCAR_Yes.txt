            I leased a 2000 Blazer LS in March of 2000 and have had both good and not so good experiences that I would like to share.

First there's the not so good.  The loud worrisome &quot;grumble noise&quot; while idling in drive.  This is not always the case, but it seems to happen from time to time.  It must be transmission related because it happens in drive while the break is applied.  

The second complaint is the mileage.  Or lack there of.  I work 16 miles from my home and make 5 round trip commutes weekly.  This adds up to 160 miles per week.  In addition to the moderate around town driving (approx. 40 miles give or take) that I usually do I need to fill up- from empty- two times per week.  That's 40 gallons of gas per week for less than 200 miles of driving.  Less than 20 mpg with most of it being on the highway?  Not very cost effective in this world of $1.69 per gallon. 

Final complaint applies if your the front passenger and you have long legs.  It doesn't seem to offer much comfort to those over six foot front seat passengers.  However, I'm 6'2&quot; and feel fine in the drivers seat.

Other than those three, there is not much else to complain about.  It's stylish and comfortable, with a nice feeling of control.  Your bigger than the other cars, but you can still manage to parallel park.<br><br>
