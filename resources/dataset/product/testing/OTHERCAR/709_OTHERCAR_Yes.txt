            Wanting to try digital photography and being somewhat of a Nikon bigot I recently purchased a Nikon Coolpix 950. So far this camera has lived up to expectations. To start taking picture is is very easy, you just turn the dial to Rec A and start shooting. To really get to know the camera you must load the on-line manual and do a little studying.

The metering seems to give me very well exposed images. I have used the camera in both outdoor situations and indoors in vastly different lighting situations. I have always gotten well exposed images of my major subject. The flash is powerful enough so the foreground is not set against a total black hole.

I would strongly recommend getting a couple of higher capacity memory cards. The 8K that comes with the camera holds very few images at a decent resolution.

The software for downloading to your computer has one drawback that I have encountered so far. If you are using your serial port for other devices i.e. a palm pilot or something, you may experience some problems as the Nikon software seems to want the port all to itself. I haven't resolved this problem yet.

I really liked the way the lens section pivots from the LCD viewer. This allows you to get some interesting angles that would be difficult with a normal configuration.
