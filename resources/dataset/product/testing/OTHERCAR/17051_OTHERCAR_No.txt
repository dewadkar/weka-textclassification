            The Dodge Durango, is a SUV that too me is cramped.  To have 3 rows of seats is nice, but there isn't any leg room.  The front seats are ok.  The further you go back the less leg room you have.  I have an eleven year old, she is needing more leg room.  I've sat in the back seat, I'm 6'2, I feel like I'm wedged in.  The seats are uncomfortable.  They lack support.  
The idea is great for the Durango.  If you were a couple with no children, it woud be ok.  If you had children and wanted to go on vacation, there isn't enough room for luggage and children.  With the 3rd seat up, there is very little cargo space.  
The gas mileage isn't to hot either. You are looking at about 15 mpg. It get the same mileage as my Suburban, which has plenty of room. 
The SUV is stylish but not functional for a family that is on the move.
