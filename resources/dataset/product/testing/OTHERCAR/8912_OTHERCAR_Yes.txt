            I am a sales representative, and until recently, my company required us to drive (company owned) white Dodge Caravan's.  <i>My first one</i> was a '96 Caravan SE.  After I put 90k miles on it, it was time for a new one.  My company got a good deal on the <i><b>'98 Grand Caravan SE</b></i> - white of course - so, here I am 82k later.  

My company will be picking it up later this week.  I'll be sad to say goodbye.  Since my company went to a car allowance, I opted for a green <b>Saturn LS1</b>.  Although I'm thrilled to finally be able to choose my own vehicle, I wonder how I'll make due with <i>less space and utility</i>?

The Caravan's <b>3.0 6 cylinder</b> will get you to 60 in about 10 seconds.  It is well suited to cruising at speeds around 80 mph.  Under heavy acceleration, the sound has a nice throaty note.  The front seats are very comfortable.  I should know... I've practically lived in Caravan seats for 4 years.  

All of the controls are where you'd expect them.  The look is definitely &quot;Dodge Tough.&quot;  Since my company was too cheap to spring for any extras, I have to deal with some minor inconveniences like...  reaching way over to the passenger side to unlock the door, and like manually rolling my windows up and down at drive-through windows and toll booths.

There are two options in particular that I would have liked... <b>Power door locks</b>, but as a <i>$400 option</i>, I think they're over priced.  And, <b>tinted windows</b> are another overpriced option; also $400!  

My <b><i>biggest complaint</i></b> with this vehicle is with the rear seats.  No.. no.. don't get me wrong... they are comfortable.  And all come with adjustable head rests.  It's that <b>they're so darn heavy</b>.  One of the rear seats weighs over 100 lbs!  

It is a weekly occurrance for me to take them out and put them in.  And, since I live in an appartment complex, I have to carry them up and down a flight of stairs each time.  <b>On the bright side</b>, I guess it's a good workout?

My <b>favorite thing</b> about the Caravan is with the utility.  The rear hatch and dual sliding side doors make it easy to get large items in and out.  And with something like 165 cubic feet, you can haul a lot.  I read somewhere that the <b>maximum payload</b> is about 1,000 lbs.  But, I often haul up to 3,500 lbs.  It messes up the handling because most of the weight shifts to the rear tires.  But, I've never had to replace a shock and it still rides like new.

The handling and braking (ABS) are better than to be expected for a mini.  I would say car-like.

This vehicle is an excellent people and stuff hauler.  My first Caravan needed a new transmission at 30k, but that problem was solved by 98.  The only <b>annoyance</b> that I've had with my '98 GC is a periodically broken fan belt.  It has happened 3 times in the last year.

<i>Dear Caravan,
You were so good to me.  You were reliable, comfortable and convenient.  I never really appreciated you.  Yes, I often tried to hide my face when I passed some cute girls on the street.  I appologize...  I just didn't want them to know that I drove a Caravan.  Now I am sad to see you go.</i>
<b><i>Goodbye my dear old Grand Caravan,
Vachipep</i></b><br><br>
