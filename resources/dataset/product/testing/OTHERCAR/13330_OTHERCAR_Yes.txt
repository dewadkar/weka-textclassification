            **January 2004 Review Update**

I love my EX-V6! This car never lets me down and I now get 24mpg in the city and on road trips I top over 39mpg! Sweet huh? I highly recommend this car!**

After extensive research I purchased a 2002 Honda Accord EX V6 4Dr. I drove every model of Accord before this purchase and let me tell you, the V6 model is the way to go! 

Once you feel the cars power, use the Climate Control and see the HomeLink system (where you can program you garage door into buttons next to your visor)the decision will be simple. 

The car lists at $25,700 with the $400 dealer imposed delivery fee, I walked out paying $22,858. Based upon numbers reviewed, I got a sweet deal. Several website say that invoice is $23,500. 

One thing concerning about my '02 Accord is the miles per gallon. I realize that I only have 800+ miles on the car but the sticker states I would get in the range of 22 city & 28hwy. I am close but far away. I am 17 on both! I know the break-in period is 2500k miles so I will have to be patient. 

Features/Toys
The 6 Disc In-Dash cd-changer is great. It makes for easy driving since you can scroll through CD tracks and adjust the volume right on the steering wheel! So nice!

Space/Legroom: You can easily fit 4 good size adults in this car for a commute. There is ample leg room and height for a comfortable ride. I transport clients in my car daily and have had great feedback.

Sunroof
Great toy for extra air and climate

Cupholders
Folding Cupholders in the backseat and adjustable cupholders for the driver and passenger.

Automatic Transmission
This is a standard feature! Thank God! I have missed not driving an Automatic vehicle and with the smooth ride of this car, I love it.

Traction Control System
This feature is hot! If you are driving in wet or slick conditions. You can activate the TCS (Traction Control System) if you start to slide the vehicle with sense the problem and apply the brake to the individual wheel that is spinning to restore control of the car!

Bottom Line
This is a luxury car that can easily compete with Lexus, Toyota and BMW. It has a classy, spacious interior with a great smooth ride. The outside appearance. Take a look. it is sweet. You can see by the above that I love my car. Drop me a line if you have a question or are going to be purchasing this car. I know it inside and out!
