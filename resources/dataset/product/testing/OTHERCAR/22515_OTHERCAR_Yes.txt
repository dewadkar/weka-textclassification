            The Toyota Land Cruiser is one of the best cars that Toyota has to offer.  The luxury and dependability this car has to offer is outstanding.  I have owned the newer version of this SUV for about a year and it sill drives like new.  Its powerful and quiet V8 engine will take you to wherever you want to go.  If you are looking for a fast car this is not the one for you but it does drive fast for its titanic size.  I recommend this vehicle to anyone who likes luxury and the capability of going off road in a car.<br><br>
