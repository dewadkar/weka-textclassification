            While looking for a new automobile, I came across a 1992 Buick LeSabre.  My expectation was for a reliable car, worth spending a bit extra in order to avoid problems in the long run.  It had 73,000 miles on it.  Thinking I'd save in troubles was a big mistake.  I've had several major repairs to the car, including replacing the brake master cylinder, one of the front wheel bearings and axle work.  In the last year, the paint has begun to peel, which I was told by somebody else is a common problem with the LeSabre's of my color.

On the positive side, the V-6 engine is smooth and economical.  And the car has a great ride to it!

Next time, I will get a mechanic to look over any used car I might purchase, no matter the brand!<br><br>
