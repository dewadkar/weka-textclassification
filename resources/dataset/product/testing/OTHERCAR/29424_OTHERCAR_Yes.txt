            I bought a used '92 Infiniti Q45 in '98. Okay, it's not the newest car on the block, but it's still got game. Everything about this car says &quot;quality&quot;. And it means it, too.

Power-train. The six cylinder engine is a quiet beast. Long steep hill up ahead? I look forward to it. In my Toyota Celica, the hill can look like Everest. In my Infiniti- an patch of dirt. The acceleration is assured, no need to hassle the peddle. And you don't even notice the gear shifts. Gear shifts? What gear shifts? 

Ride. Very comfortable. Sometimes verging on sublime. Almost feel like you're more in a plane than a car when coming out of the mountains. It's quiet too. Smooth seals and other aerodynamic features prevent wind howling at speeds. No rickety noise, bumping of metal to metal, or other &quot;what-was-thats?&quot; 

Interior. There is some slight leather cracking, but I do have an older model. The sound system is mostly clear and vibrant. The cassette player wasn't working when I bought the car, but I'm inclined to think it had something to do with the previous owner-not the manufacturer. The 5 CD player has cut out on me and needs to be fixed and it was making a high-pitched just audible squeaking sound. The environmental system is great. It has manual and auto temperature controls. It doesn't have cup-holders, which I find really annoying, but I believe the newer model has them. The sun-roof is a personal favorite.

Repair, Maintenance, Gas. $380 for a pair of Michelins. $120 for a battery. $130 for air conditioning fluid. This car costs. The gas is premium, too. But I haven't really had too much trouble with it. The amount of repairs seems to be balance by the infrequency of the repairs.

Overall, this is a great driving experience.
