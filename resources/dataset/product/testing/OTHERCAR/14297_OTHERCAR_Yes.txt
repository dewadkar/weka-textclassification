            I bought this with no reviews to work off of and no prior experience in digital camera shopping. It was worth the risk though! It&#146s very easy to use. You can adjust a lot of settings like brightness, something that&#146s missing with most in this price range. There are a lot of automatic settings like, fireworks, sunset, high glare, fluorescent, sunlight etc etc etc. It also comes with a flash that will work automatically if there's too little light. You can also turn the flash on all the time, or turn it off completely to save batteries. The flash can be strong if you&#146re too close, experiment with it to get it right. It even comes with a macro to deal with portraits, close ups, and landscapes.

The LCD is very handy. The menu of the camera actually operates from the LCD so there are a lot of options. Only downside is that its hard to use in direct sunlight. If you place your hand over the LCD you can see it fine though. You can delete one picture or all of them if you want. 

It only has 7mb of storage. This may be a problem for some people. To get around this there are a total of 6 settings to mess with. There are 3 image sizes 1600x1200, 1280x960, 640x480. There are also 3 image qualities, fine, normal and economy. Depending on how you arrange these there are a multitude of pics you can take. I believe the most is 120 at a time. Fortunately there is extra storage capacity using SD or MMC. Memory is cheap and I recommend getting at least 16mb more with your camera. 

To expand on the memory, you don't lose pictures when you take out the battery. The longest I've ever gone without one has been about 5 minutes, but when I put it back in all of my pictures were still there. I was very relieved!

There&#146s still image, web cam, and video. The image, and web cam work nicely. The video works very well. I expected it to be choppy but its smooth like real video. 

The image quality is great. I really was impressed. I experimented with it to see if it would blur with movement. If people are moving normally it works fine. But then i had my friend run around like a moron jumping and what not. Out of 10 shots 2 of them were blurry. That&#146s acceptable to me.

One thing that I really liked was the rechargeable battery. It doesn&#146t come with a recharger though! On top of that I can&#146t find a recharger for a CR-123 battery. That&#146s a downer, but the batteries last quite a while if you&#146re smart with your camera. Batteries are about 2 for 4 bucks. If you consider the money you&#146re saving on film and developing you&#146re really making out like a bandit since 1 battery takes something like 120 shots (may be more refer to official specs).

This camera works great; it will impress even the enthusiasts with its great price. I&#146d recommend it to any of my friends, but somebody that is into professional photograph should buy a $300 camera. I really enjoy this camera and I&#146m sure Ill have it for quite a long time. 

Please don&#146t make the mistake of buying an unusually CHEAP digital camera. A couple of my friends have cameras under 50 and the pictures are so blurry and grainy that they aren't even worth looking at.
