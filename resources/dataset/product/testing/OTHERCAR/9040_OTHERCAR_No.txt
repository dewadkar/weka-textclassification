            The Kia Sportage was pretty new to me, and I wanted to give it a fair chance of making a good impression on me. After test driving it for some time, I wasn't disappointed by it's performance - but I wasn't very impressed either. Besides its nice look, it also had a very nice round price for it - which was very affordable. But as the old saying goes ,&quot;TYou get what you pay for.&quot; Not only was the Kia Sportage SUV's quality very poor, but it also looses it's value very quickly. So, even though this SUV will be gentle on your wallet, it won't last very strong in quality. So think twice before buying the Kia Sportage.<br><br>
