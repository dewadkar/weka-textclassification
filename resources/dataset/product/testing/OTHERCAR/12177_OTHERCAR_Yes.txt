            ACCOLADES GALORE...

Lest we forget, since time and time again, man and machine have always been at odds with each other. But this is the car that proved me wrong. Especially when all has been said and done i believe in this case  we have a winner. BUYER BEWARE! WHEN IT COMES TO VALUE. YOU WILL GET MORE YEN FOR YOUR DOLLAR. Words simply, are not enough and cannot describe the awe and wonder that filled me when i test drove this car. And just o cut to the chase all the creature comforts we take for granted are not left unnoticed when it comes to Lexus. From the extremely smooth handling and quiet suspension you would have to agree the engineering is flawless. Ideally to make sense of everything, you will certainly come to an understanding of how nice it feels to own the Ls 430. I swear i could just go on and on about how this car delivers with excess(es). Deservedly this car is beyond without measure. personally i have to say this is the car that stole my heart. I JUST LOVE IT... PERIOD.  

INTERIOR DECOR.
The plush leather and interior are very much exquisite and strikingly beautiful. 

INSTRUMENT PANEL AND DASHBOARD: 
Enhanced white lighting in the instrument panel adds appeal. Interior is very neat from the dashboard and you get the  feeling everything is visually within your reach. 

DESIGN AND TRIM FEATURES

I am not for the aerodynamic look. The body is reminiscent and a copy of Mercedes. 

EXTERIOR
Also the head lights are too loud and somewhat obnoxious.

INTERIOR
The roominess is intoxicating and warm. It feels just right.

LUXURY
Nothings been compromised. This is extravagant as you can get. Pleasant feeling all around.

OVERALL
When all has been said and done , i have to say nowadays cars do not get any better than this. Especially for those of you who can afford it this is as good as it gets. Need i say more... Life has been so good to me.
