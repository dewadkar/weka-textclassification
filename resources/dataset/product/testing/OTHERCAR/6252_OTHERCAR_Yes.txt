            Well I *was* a Chevy man.
I had my ol' V6 Pickup without a scratch, and 165K on the clock.
One morning I awoke and my trusty truck was not in my driveway any more!
I was sad, mad, and not glad. Being a gear-head, I put all my toys into the back of that pickup time and time again and could not imagine life without my white aluminum horse.
Looking at the new Chevys with an Extended or Crew cab made it apparent that I would not be able to park these behemoths in most situations. Besides, the less then 10MPG for a big Chevy or Ford was nearly prohibitive.
It was November 1999 and there were little in the way of Extended
cab trucks available from anyone.
One day I was driving the Insurance-supplied rent-a-car down the freeway when I saw one of the Nissan Crew Cabs in that horrid yellow color. The color caught my eye, and I decided to stop and give it a look.
Like the old Bugs Bunny cartoons, the car looked diminutive from the outside but seemed very roomy and comfy on the inside.
I even got out of the car a few times to see if the inside really looked bigger than the outside - months later it still looks this way to me.
Then I closed the door to see how the car felt.
THERE WAS SILENCE!
Not silence like you get when you are out at a BBQ on a summer evening, but silence like you get from inside a bank vault!
In fact, the Nissan proved to be the only truck I tested which required a Tachometer so that you do not forget and try to start the motor when it is already running! (that quiet, really!)
Next I took the little truck for a drive. The power was surprising for a small truck. While I heard that the Dakota had more H.P. The Nissan is about as fast(1/4 mile) and seems to pull harder. I drove a 5-speed version as I am allergic to automatic transmissions.
The next surprise was the handling - it does not handle like a truck at all. No roll in the turns, and it actually takes curvy roads easily, even while totally loaded down with my moto gear.
Compared to the Dakota or the S10, the Nissan seemed to drive smoother, ride quieter and higher, and clearly could hang in the turns.
(toss a 4 door Dakota or a big GM into a 60MPH turn and you will know what I mean!)
The backseat is nice for about 80% of its intended use.
I am 6' 2&quot; and can fit in the back fine, but would not want to be back there for a 5 hour trip or anything. (2 or 3 would be ok)
For a child or two and a dog, the backseat is more than enough. Its also nice to have a place in the pickup to put stuff you do not want stolen or melted - cannot remember how many things I 'lost' behind the seats of my regular-cab Chevy!
The A/C system is fine, but it has one speed. I don't mind, but those spoiled people with too much money may want for a 'HIGH' setting.
Whats nice about the A/C is that when you drive with a 5-speed you do not notice the A/C like you do on the Chevys or Fords. Even the big GM V8's had a noticable lag when the A/C pump comes on. The Nissan makes the A/C load barely noticable and has no measurable effect on your CITY mileage.
The bed is short. Nissan was nice enough to make a bed extender standard with many models. If you do not get a bed extender do not worry.
For things like motorcycles you do not want the extender anyhow, and its useless with materials like dirt or gravel.
The bed is as solid as my Chevy and a bit better connected to the frame. It also has wayyy more places for tie downs. To contrast, the new Full-size 2000 Fords still have the best and most numerous tie-downs of any pickup bed. (then Dodge and then Nissan)
You can carry large stuff in the bed without problems, but you have to remember to tie down the rear of the material(s) if you do not use the bed extender.
My truck came with a roof rack, step bumpers, and more. It MORE than makes up for the space lost in the bed when you can put 120Lbs+ on the roof in a large-tube metal roof rack.
At first I missed the 'big iron' feel of my old Chevy. But the Nissan gets better mileage, had less maintenance, AND CAN TOW MORE WEIGHT!
Yep! My Chevy would groan on hills with a full bed and the camping trailer. Now I have that much stuff and two MORE people and the Nissan will climb hills in 5Th gear with a head wind.
The Nissan choices for car stereos suck worse than a black hole. Get the wrose stereo they have and throw it out and get a new one from anyone other than Nissan. Even the Bose system ($2000 option) is not on par with a $600 Alpine or Pioneer. Paper speakers and poor placement only make the car sound worse.
My car came with the full car alarm. You can imagine I got this due to the car theft. It works fine, but is not stellar in any way either.

If you need a truck you can depend on, which will take the beating like a GM, but cost less to maintain, fuel, and repair, then I highly recommend the Nissan Crew Cab. If you like the outdoors or live in the snow, get the additional 4WD option and you are ready for death matches with Mad Max.
Do not buy this truck if you are one of those 'kill the environment because I have more money than brains and do not care if I have a 14 foot car which gets 8 MPG'. That is what the Suburbans and Excursions are for. This is not the best for a Construction contractor, but a plumbing or electrical contractor will find the truck has enough space for your stuff and your employees.

P.S. When I bought the car, Nissan was NOT helpful in getting me the setup I wanted. I had to 'settle' on a car which did not have all the feaures or the paint color I wanted.
The Austin Texas Nissan dealers have also proven to be as bright as a wet match stick.
Nissan has a 5yr-100KMile warranty they do not talk about. I recommend it highly. (about $1500)<br><br>
