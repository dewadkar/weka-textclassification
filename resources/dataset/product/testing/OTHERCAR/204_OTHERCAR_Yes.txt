            This SUV is the best deal out in the market right now.  It has more horse power than any mid-size SUV out there.  It rides very smoothly, and corners accurately.  I occassionally enjoy rough it up in the dirt with my rodeo, and it was a lot of fun.  If you are looking- get the silver color it looks sleek, and gets you a lot of compliments on the road.  Last but not least, Isuzu offers the best vehicle warranty program in the whole industry.  You are covered for more than 100,000 miles.  There is not much to hate about the vehicle.<br><br>
