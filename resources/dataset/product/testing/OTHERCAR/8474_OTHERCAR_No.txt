            Backstory: I chose the Fuji 2600 (now replaced by the 2650, which appears to largely be the same camera, only using XD memory cards instead of Smart Media) as a first digital camera. For a while, I was quite pleased with it. However, lately I've been starting to be bothered by its flaws. That, and the battery door broke.

What it looks like: The Fuji 2600 is a fairly attractive, fairly small digital camera. It's not a "Shirt Pocket" camera, but it's certainly a "Pants Pocket" camera. However, upon closer inspection, the camera doesn't hold up quite as well. The body of the camera has a cheap, plastic feel (which could be because it is plastic). One must slide over a cover manually (which clicks twice before the camera can be used) to take the pictures. Despite the fact that this seems like a flaw, the cover actually has stood up. That's more than I can say about the battery cover on the bottom, which cracked and fell off after a year. The batteries may also fall out when you open the cover on the bottom (the memory card also goes in a slot on the bottom next to the batteries) The back of the camera offers a pretty bright (adjustable brightness) LCD. The LCD isn't too tough to view in bright light, but it's not a high-res LCD screen and it's a little tough to determine exactly how a picture turned out.

Image quality: Here's where this camera varies a lot. Outdoor pictures will never look terrible, however, over a year of use, I've noticed a lot of variation over seasons. Fall and Winter shots with softer light looked crisp and clear, with pleasing colors and detail. Some of these shots even appeared quite striking. However, Summer shots in bright sunlight are another story. Depending on how this camera catches hard light, colors - and the picture in general - can appear washed out. Colors as a whole on this camera were never exceptional (that's one of the reasons why I upgraded to a Canon ELPH), but they really took a hit in some of the bright, sunlit pictures I took. I've gotten fine 4x6s out of this camera, but 8x10s....no.

Low-light pictures with natural light don't happen. You may be surprised and get the occasional one that works, but mostly, low-light pictures w/o flash are a blur. The camera includes an adjustable flash, which works decently for up to moderate distances.

The camera includes a 3x optical zoom and additional digital zoom, although the digital zoom takes away from image quality. 30-second movie recording and self-timer for pictures are also included.

Performance:

The camera offers a rather slow shutter, which will disappoint those trying to capture action. However, I eventually managed to get the timing down. For example, I was at an aquarium watching a dolphin show, where the dolphins were leaping fairly high out of the water. If I clicked right when they came out of the water, I was getting pictures of them on their way back down. Time between pictures isn't too bad, but it's just not a camera for capturing quick moments. The camera is also touchy about slight shaking during a picture.

Battery life (the camera takes 2 AAs - I'd recommend NiMH rechargables) is decent - you can get about 100 (more or less) pictures out of a pair of AA rechargables. I was originally very pleased with the ability to use AAs. However, I now use a camera with Lithium-Ion batteries. Despite the fact that those batteries are more expensive, they offer much, much better battery life.

Features:

* Adjustable exposure, white balance. There's really not much in the way of manual adjustments, but that's fairly expected, given the price.

* The camera takes Smart Media cards, which don't seem to be used by many cameras at all anymore (the replacement for the 2600, the 2650, uses XD cards, which all of Fuji's new cameras use), at least that I've seen.

Overall, this seemed like a fine camera for the price when I first got it almost exactly one year ago. However, it's flaws and cheap construction have gotten more and more obvious the more I use it. The broken battery door was the final reason that got me looking for something new. I've also seem some of the other cameras in this price range, which seem to perform better, be built better and offer better quality than the Fujis.  Yes, it's inexpensive (I paid about $225 a year ago, but now the 2600 and the new 2650 seem to be available for $150-200), but even for beginners, I'd recommend spending a little more to get something better that's less fragile and has more features.

Not recommended.
