            My parents bought me and my sister this car and we have not had very good luck with it.  We have had problems with the mirrors falling off of the side mirrors, the front lights falling out of their sockets, and even the seat belt buckle breaking.  

It is a nice little car to get around in, but I don't think I would trust it for long car rides or leaving it out in the cold for extended periods of time.  The car was a reasonable price for around $8,000.00 a couple years ago, but we have spent around $3,000-$4,000 just to fix it up these past couple of years.  

Besides the mirrors and lights, the external part of the car has kept in good shape.  The interior has also stayed in good shape except for the seat belt buckle, as I said before.

Overall, I think this would be a good car for someone that does not drive on good trips and is looking to save money.  However, there are better cars that one could find out on the market.<br><br>
