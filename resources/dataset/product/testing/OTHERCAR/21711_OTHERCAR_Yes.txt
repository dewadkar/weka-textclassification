            I bought this car new in June of 1998, it was my first brand new car, and I liked how the Cavalier looked, and I have heard good things about it.

I have a Cavalier RS, green, with CD Player, Sunroof, and A/C.  Overall, I have had no real serious problems, just a few minor things.  I had the AC installed, this added to the price a bit, but it can get hot in Upstate NY in the summer time, and before it was installed, it was HOT.  However, there was a little problem with the relay switch I believe it was called, and when the compressor turned and I was in a gear the car would stall, usually when I was in reverse.  It took them forever to figure out what the problem was, you know how it is....You bring your car to the dealer with a problem, and it never does what you said it does.  I had to leave it overnight and then they found the problem.  I brought it to the dealer and the transported it to the place where the A/C was installed and it was brought back to me within an hour and a half. 

A few months ago, everytime I would drive on wet pavement, the ABS light and the ETS off light would come on, and when I would be on dry pavement it would go off.  Of course I was most paranoid with this, because it all started when it was snowing, I was like great, no ABS.  Well I read the manual and it said to turn the car off, well I could not do that on the highway so I waited until I got to my destination, and it did go off, only to come back on.  The it was good for awhile, and then it started again, and I finally realized when it would go on.  So again I go to the dealer and it turned out to be two little wires or something, they were so small, about the size of a miniature Christmas light.

I was always taught that if you are good to your car, it will be good to you.  I make sure that the oil is changed every 2,000-3,000 miles, and I make sure it is serviced when needed.  I must say that it has been good to me.

Other than that I have had no problems with this car.  It's great on gas mileage,  as most small cars are, and I think that it is pretty roomy, the back seat is pretty comfy, I could go a long trip back there I think, and I like how the back seat goes down so the trunk can be bigger, I helped my friend move and she was so surprised at how much stuff we could get in my car, and my mother and I also brought a huge box with an artificial Christmas tree home in it.

I recommend this car because I have had no major problems with it, I think it was well worth my money, and I would buy another Cavalier, just not green as you are washing it every day.
