            My family was looking for an SUV with features and storage capacity that wouldn't break our budget.  We found it in the Santa Fe.  It includes just about all of the standard features that you would find on more expensive models, at a more economical price.  Plus, the Santa Fe rides super smoothly and is easy to drive.  I've driven many types of vehicles in the past, and driving the Santa Fe is just like driving a car.

If there is a downside to the Santa Fe, it is probably that it doesn't have the pick-up of some of the more expensive SUVs out there.  It could use some more horsepower, and well, when you turn on the air conditioner, its power is decreased even further.  Still, if you're not a speed-demon - its pick-up time is adequate.  

We've had our Santa Fe for over a year now, and it appears to be wearing well.  We also have a Hyundai Elantra that we bought at the same time, and that already has some cosmetic problems - but we haven't had any such problems with our Santa Fe.  Everything appears to be holding up well.  It still drives wonderfully, looks great, and has yet to need even a minor repair.
