            We bought this truck new in 1999, and were happy with it for about 2 weeks.  It had less than 2000 miles on it when we noticed that the lumbar support in the driver's seat wasn't working, and that the passenger seat would not lock into place.  This is an LS extended cab version, with the V-6 engine.  Having the passenger seat slide forward every time you brake is not pleasant, nor is it very safe.  Took the truck in for service, night mare to say the least.  We bought it at Daniels Chevrolet in Colorado Springs, and I will never buy there again.  Listed below are all the problems with the vehicle and the outcome of the service under warranty.

Lumbar support failure- replaced seat, still doesn't work

recliner handle broke off- replaced seat, broke again, replaced handle, broke again

passenger seat fails to lock into place- replaced seat and track, still won't lock securely

plastic radiator cap broke and lost while driving- hassled dealer into checking entire cooling system for problems, replaced cap with another plastic one, broke again, we bought an after market metal one, no problems now.

paint chips and flakes before had 2000 miles on it- had rims repainted by dealer, flaking off again, painted rims by auto shop out of own pocket, no more flaking.

heater vents don't work anymore- 1000 miles over warranty, so haven't repaired yet

carpet tore by dealer when repairing seats,dealer replaced after big hassle

brakes wore out at 30,000 miles

metal thin on bed, dented when putting bag of groceries into bed

can't haul more than 500 lbs in bed without bottoming out stock suspension.

window seals cracked at about 20,000 miles, replaced by dealer, but now cracking again (40,000)

many,many rattles and creaks, large air whistle by driver's door, none would be repaired by dealer

Every time we took the truck in for a problem, we would have to go twice or more, first to find out what was needed, then to supposedly get it repaired, find out the mechanic ordered the wrong part, then again to have the repair.  Nearest dealer is over 100 miles away, and only time they gave us a loaner was when the truck needed to be painted and would be there for a week.  They gave us a rental car that had no spare tire, no brakes, and broke down within 50 miles.  No recompense for having it towed back to them.  Several times we got the "this is just normal wear and tear " or "this is normal breaking in" line, but when they found out that my husband is an ASE certified mechanic, all of a sudden they could fix the problem.

I always liked Chevys, have not liked Fords for years, but I am finding that I may be switching to Dodges soon.  The value on the S-10 went down much too fast for my liking, and with all the flaws I can see why.  Parts are expensive for them once the warranty is up, and they are getting very hard to repair.  Lately the driver's door handle on the inside has broken, which entails strippind down the whole door and replacing the entire mechanism when all that is broken is the little plastic handle.  Had to order the part from Chevy, came in a box two feet long, contains the entire mechanism.  Cost $65 at wholesale, when all that needed to be replaced was a plastic handle that likely could have cost $5-10.

Have my heart set on a Dodge Dakota quad cab next.
