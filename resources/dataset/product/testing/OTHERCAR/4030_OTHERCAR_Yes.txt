            We purchased this car to tow a horse trailer and a pop up camper in Jan 2001 with a 5.3L V8, leather seats, LT package, sun roof, 3rd row seat and tow package.  It is a nice driver and very comfortable with the million way adjustable bucket seats.   (I really wanted vinyl floors but couldn't find one within a couple hundred miles).  We have used it on a dozen major trips with the camper and average one horse hauling trip per week.  It goes hunting in the winter with dog kennels in the back.

The truck now has 47000 miles on it.  There have been no rattles or trim issues but there have been a couple show stopping problems.  The power steering pump broke a power steering shaft at under 24000 miles and had to be towed in.  A coworker's tahoe also broke the same part at around the same mileage.  The airbag light started giving me problems at around 30,000 miles and they cleaned the connector because of some code in the car's computer.  That connector was cleaned again at 40,000 miles.  At 45000 miles the light came on again and it cost $100 to fix per a TSB.  The gear shift cable broke at 47000 miles locking the car in park.  It was probably installed improperly, and rerouted at 3000 miles, and broke one strand at a time.  That caused the car be towed in for a second time within the first 34 months of owning it.  The 30 month old car was out of warranty so that cost another $380. Chevy's answer was that I should have bought the extended warranty.  The unit has been very reliable except for the two times that the  $35,000 car had to be towed in.

The truck has been a good horse hauler (16ft stock trailer with from 1-3 horses/ponies in it).  The wheelbase is a bit short for high speed pulling but it does great around town.  We've also used it to pull a pup and up to 60mph.  

We love this car since it acts as our truck and our family vehicle.  You will like it too but remember that GM still has some reliability issues.  

This car is the new body style for 2000.
