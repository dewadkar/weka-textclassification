             The Mazda 626 is an excellent choice for all ages. The Mazda 626 can be purchased in 4 or 6 cylinder engines, either a good buy. The 4 cylinder Mazda handles excellent both in town and on the highway. It also gets awesome gas mileage. The pick-up is exceptional for a four cylinder engine and the shock system is one of the best we tested. It is luxurious, roomy and stylish, but the best part is, is that it is affordable! The 626 runs anywhere between 19,500-22,000. The 1999 standard model comes complete with a CD player, power steering and is an automatic. The 626 is a wonderful choice for all people. I highly recommend it!<br><br>
