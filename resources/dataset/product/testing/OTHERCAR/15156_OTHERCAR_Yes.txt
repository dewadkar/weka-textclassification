                 I purchased this particular camera because it was the best buy compared to other digital cameras.  The camera was very easy to get started using.  The manual that comes with the camera doesn't give much help.  You have to use the CD text version. The first day of using the camera was very successful.  Picture quality is excellent.  I couldn't tell the difference between the 35mm and my digital after placing on the fridge next to other pictures. 

 The problem I ran into after using the camera for a couple of days (1)  The batteries did not last through the first day use.  Actually about 15 shots and they were gone.

(2) The battery compartment is very difficult to get closed and stay closed. Like some other reviews I read said, &quot;The batteries felt like they would pop out any moment.&quot; 

(3)  I couldn't get the USB to hook up during every use. The first day it worked o.k. I had to restart the computer each time I wanted to down load pictures. The next day I took pictures and then went to download, doing nothing differently than the previous day, and I couldn't get a connection to the camera.  I reinstalled, rebooted, did everything I possibly could think of and couldn't get a connection to the camera.  I thought maybe it was the cable and took the camera back.  They didn't have another one on hand , so I haven't replaced my camera yet. After reading some of the reviews , I've seen that the same problem has been occuring with them, so obviously it's not the computer or the cable as I thought it might be. 

(4)  The 4mb smart media card will hold only 6 best quality pictures.  You need higher mb and the price is very expensive for smart media cards.  The camera is a good quality picture taking camera.  I loved the quality and have tried other digital cameras with less (1.3 mega pixel)  and didn't like the quality of the picture.

 I'm not for sure what I will do now.  I really want to get another Toshiba for the quality of the shot, but knowing what I have already gone through with it and hearing that the same thing has been happening to other people,I will probably try and find another high pixel, but different brand camera. <br><br>
