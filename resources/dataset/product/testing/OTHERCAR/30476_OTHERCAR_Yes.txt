            I have had a white Toyota Corolla for 4 years, it has 90,000 miles on it, and it still runs like I got it a few days ago...I am also a very aggresive driver, and am very hard on cars...I bought it used with 25,000 miles on it...I love the Corolla, because it is the most dependable car I have ever driven...It always starts, and I love it...It might be a little tight in back, but there is a lot of room up front, and it is very comfortable...This car is perfect for someone who is on the move a lot, and does not need to carry people around...cause there is very little room in back...The driving of the Toyota Corolla is great, it is very easy to drive this car, I think that all people should learn to drive, on this car, because it is so easy to control...Therefore, I believe that anyone who has their driver's license. So I would purchase the Toyota Corolla...<br><br>
