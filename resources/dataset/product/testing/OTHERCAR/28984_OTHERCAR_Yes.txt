            You could call me a car nut.  I fully admit it.  I LOVE cars.  Everything about them.  I have a respect for all cars, but a few in particular keep a special place in my ardor.  The Lincoln Mark VIII is one of them.

This review will specifically cover the 1997-1998 Mark VIII, but certain information will be applicable to all models since 1993.  For the 1997 model year, the Mark VIII was redesigned to look more refined, more curvy, and downright swoopy.  Its update added a few key elements, including xenon headlamps and neon taillights.  The body was more stylized also, the signature &quot;tire hump&quot; on the deck lid was subdued, for instance, but the lights are the most noticeable difference.  The engine, transmission, and other mechanical elements remained essentially the same after the redesign.

The engine in the Mark VIII is one of its best qualities.  It is a 4.6 liter DOHC 32 valve Intech V8.  In the base Mark VIII it produces 280 hp and in the LSC 290 hp...more on the LSC later.  The transmission is a 4 speed automatic, and is one of the cars weakest points.  The transmission has the insatiable habit of shifting right in the middle of the most common speeds, and can be quite annoying.  People that drive the Mark complain about this element more than any other.  Its peculiar behavior is completely normal.  The engine more than makes up for the transmission's vices.  It is quite powerful while being quiet and refined.  It will do 130 mph effortlessly.  Its performance is gutsy, crisp, and inspires confidence.  It is not uncommon to beat a Ford Mustang off the line in the much heavier Mark--the engine's that good (one bad thing about this engine: it requires premium fuel).  Furthermore, the Mark VIII is rear wheel drive, which is a rarer and rarer thing these days.

The aforementioned LSC (Luxury Sport Coupe) is the performance model of the Mark VIII.  Its engine produces 10 more horsepower, it has larger anti-roll bars on the front and rear suspension, and it has body color-matched trim on the grille and around the taillights.  It also has special chrome wheels.  These additions may not seem like much, but you can expect to pay up to $5000 more for a LSC over a base Mark VIII with similar mileage.  

Another strong point on the Mark VIII are its multiple technological innovations and various doodads.  The headlamps are not the typical halogen, but are made of xenon, which gives off a characteristic bright blue-white light and are far superior to traditional halogen in range and illumination.  The taillights feature a tube on the deck lid injected with neon gas, which gives off a bright red glow when brakes are applied.  Neon lights up one-fifth of a second faster than a halogen bulb, which at 45 mph gives 17 ft more stopping distance.  Also, the suspension on the Mark is fully independent with pneumatic (air) shocks.  This supple and stable suspension actually lowers the car the faster you go.  Cool, huh?

The Mark VIII is a beautiful car.  It is large, luxurious, and powerful.  If you demand luxury and desire solid performance and speed, the Lincoln Mark VIII is the ideal choice.  It truly is a paragon of engineering.            <br><br>
