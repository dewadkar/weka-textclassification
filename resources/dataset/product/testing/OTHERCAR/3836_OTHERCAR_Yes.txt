            The 2002 Honda CR-V had some minor issues when it was first produced--some had seats that rocked forward (since fixed) and a drift to the right. My car, manufactured in March 2002, did not have any of these issues. 

The car comes as a 2 wheel-drive (WD) LX, a 4WD LX, and the top-of-the-line  4WD EX.

All trim lines feature a 4 cylinder engine, 160 hp, multi-point fuel injection and 110,000 mile tune-up interval. The 4WD models are Real-Time four wheel drive, meaning that the rear wheels kick in when the front wheels begin to slip. The 2WD models are front wheel drive only.

The 4 WD is available as a manual or automatic transmission and all trim lines include power-assisted 4-wheel disc brakes, a nice feature over disc and drum. Anti-lock braking systems are only available on the EX.

All trim lines come with dual power mirrors, intermittent rear window wiper/washer, body side molding, exterior spare tire with cover, full swinging tailgate with glass hatch, air conditioning, power windows, AM/FM stereo cassette w/CD player, clock and 4 speakers (the EX includes a 6-disc in-dash CD player and 6 speakers), cruise control, airbags on the driver and passenger side, retractable center tray, sunglass holder, removable folding picnic table, waterproof rear storage well, and rear window defroster. 

The EX also comes with tinted glass in the rear and a moonroof.

Likes

I was attracted to it because of the Honda brand--noted for reliability and a higher re-sale price down the road--as well as the price. Options such as the CD/tape/radio were included on the LX model, tinted windows and ABS were standard on the EX. Other cars would have charged extra for a lot of the options that were already included here, so it made sense to go with the lower priced CR-V.
I have found the car  to handle well in the snow and truly excellent in the rain--a big change from the Nissan Maxima and the Jeep Cherokee Sport I drove previously (the wheels would spin in the former, and fish-tail in the latter).

Dislikes

While I like the car overall, I am disappointed with the noise in the cabin. On concrete road surfaces, it's amazing how loud it is. And, in the rain, it has sounded like golf balls hitting my roof!
