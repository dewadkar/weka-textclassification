            I bought this camera mainly to share quick pictures with my friends and family.  It's very easy to use and takes GREAT pictures of high quality.  It's good for beginners, for online auction pictures (with careful attention to lighting)and more.  The serial cable that comes with it is the least desirable way to transfer pictures to a computer.  I first bought a card reader and it was nearly as slow as the serial cable.  I returned it and bought a USB card reader, and it might as well be another disk drive, very quick!  I bought and will continue to buy flash cards with more than the 8MB that comes with the camera (20MB is barely enough).
I don't especially like one part of the design, but I understand it's common with digital cameras (low end and medium priced): the view area is right smack where your nose goes!  
I chose this particular camera because of its price as well as that I trust the company.  The cameras at lower prices didn't have the zoom or the pixel quality I wanted, and there was a big price jump above this to get some more features that I didn't particularly need.
