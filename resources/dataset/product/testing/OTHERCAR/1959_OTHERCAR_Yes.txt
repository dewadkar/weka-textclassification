            The test drives were what finally won me over and I'm glad I made the leap.  This car has just about everything I could think of AND at a pleasing price after you've done all your comparison research.  

First off, if you've decided on a mid size sedan in the entry luxury area, then you may have taken a similar route and ended up with a choice between the Infiniti I30 and Nissan Maxima like I did.  There are some differences which led me to select the GLE Maxima over the I30 Luxury Edition.  The I30 is more luxurious in the sense it has a longer warranty (4 vs 3 yr), better service (from what I've heard), a higher price (perhaps 2 or 3 thousand on the configuration I was looking at) and more features.  The feature differences I noted included: an automatic rear window sunshade, front driver seat memory position, additional dashboard storage area, the Infiniti analog clock, auto seat positioning upon entry and exit, additional right front passenger cup holder, additional four inch body length, leather covered interior handles.  Overall however, because they are based on the same platform, the layout, design, engine, durasteel paneling materials (not shape) seem to be very similar if not identical.  Someone mentioned to me that the I30 also had better insulation for a quieter drive but I noticed no difference.  The five additional hp engine I think would also be unnoticeable for the majority of drivers.  Overall, the extra features from a personal standpoint were unnecessary.  You can get similar options on the GLE Maxima to be configured like an I30 w/ heated seats, side airbags and still come up 2 to 3 thousand less.  I went for the more practical, more sporty designed Maxima as might other 20-30 yr old single guys.  I could however see those who would opt for a more luxurious, chrome grilled/trimed version of the same car though.  

The deciding factors here are admittedly subjective.  I eliminated the other higher priced and lower priced sedans (Mercedes, BMW, Toyota Camry, Honda Accord) based on feel and design.  The I30 and Maxima gave a feeling of greater spaciousness with the dashboard curving away from the front seat occupants.  The driver &quot;cockpit&quot; has the dashboard placement and steering wheel placed in ways you could tell were ergonomically tested.  The engine I don't need to say has 222 hp (227 on the I30) which makes passing/acceleration sheer pleasure.  I can only compare this to the electric vehicles I've driven which accelerate fast but so smoothly and quietly it feels like you've got the wind behind you on an America's Cup race.  The rear passenger space as well as the trunk have also been enlarged though from the outside you can't tell the difference from the '96 Maxima and the '00 Maxima.  

Lastly, I would suggest considering ordering through the Internet i.e. carorder.com if you're looking to save an additional thousand or so (below invoice!).  Something to think about and definitely worth a test drive around the block or two.  <br><br>
