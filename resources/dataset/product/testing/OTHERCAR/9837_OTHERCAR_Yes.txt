            April, 2000.  With no budget (we were only buying a car because of a bad accident which resulted in a writeoff vehicle) and mileage that averages 20K a year, we needed new (or nearly new) and cheap to run.   We needed a station-wagon. Not a car, not a van, but a STATION WAGON.  Do you have ANY idea how few reasonably-priced, reasonably-sized station wagons are available in the US?  Particularly if you want a manual transmission AND cruise control..... ;)  

If you can sacrifice size, the small Saturn is a great choice, but with a kid and a large dog, we needed more room (the new, larger Saturn had only just hit the market when we were buying, so it wasn't an option for us due to price).  Honda, Subaru and VW make YUMMY station wagons... but not in our price range!  We considered a secondhand Ford Escort, but couldn't FIND one, and we were buying before the Focus was readily available.  The Hyundai was a possibility, but it was still pretty small and my long legs did not fit happily under the steering wheel (plus, at $14K, it was still above our budget).

We knew about Daewoo from years living in Europe, suddenly, there they were again.  I'd never even NOTICED them turn up in the US until we were actively looking, but I thought "why not?" and went down to the dealers.

I drove it.  I loved it. It was bigger.  It was cheaper.  It was NICER than the others we could afford!  Despite the question marks over the company's future (we're still crossing our fingers that GM will buy them and ensure that it will still be around in 10 years!) we decided to go with it, particularly as the dealer was DESPERATE to (you should pardon the pun) shift a manual transmission model (with all frills, INCLUDING cruise control!) and cut us a huge discount. 

We LOVE our Nubira. It has done 37K miles in less than 2 years with, so far (touch wood!), no more than a couple of minor problems.  It needed a new radio unit (the one that it came with had a loose cable or something, and it would "crackle" when you played cds), the original battery shorted shortly after we got it and was replaced and the handbrake loosened.  All covered under guarantee (as was the servicing, meaning it really was "gas and go") So far, that's it, and given the hard use it's had, that's nothing short of remarkable.

The mileage is great.  It's comfortable.  My kid and my dog (and the stroller and accompanying STUFF we always have with us) all fit easily into it.  The ABS brakes have saved my skin more than once, and it has handled well in all kinds of different weather.  The paintwork still looks great.  

The stereo system is terrific, the seats are wearing well and easy to clean and the little "luxury" touches (like the black grid behind the rearview mirror, height adjustable seats, keyless locking/unlocking on the key itself etc) are thoughtful and genuinely helpful. 

My only (small) niggles are the flimsy and ill-placed cupholders (in front of the radio controls and unable to cope with anything other than a can or "medium" fast-food cup) and the cruise control is a little jerky when adjusting speed, but I still use it regularly (and it doesn't make me carsick, which many cars do).

The only other "minus" is that this is a tough car to fit a childseat in intuitively - because of the seatbelt placement, you have to know the "tricks" to get a really good tight fit. That said, it has roof tether anchors (until recently few cars had tether anchors at all).   If you plan to use a childseat, I recommend you get a CPS tech to show you how to do it -- once a CPS tech shows you how to safely adjust the seatbelt anchor strap, it's done relatively easily and completely safely.

What more can you say about a budget family car than that it runs reliably, it's comfortable and it has a whole bunch of "extras" which make it feel like it's inexpensive rather than cheap?  I hope its longterm reliability is as good as it's demonstrated to date, because I LOVE my car.  Here's hoping GM buy it and keep it in the family - I'd have another one in a minute.
