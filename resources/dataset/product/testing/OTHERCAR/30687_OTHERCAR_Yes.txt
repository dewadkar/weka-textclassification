            In December of 1993 my old car had finally drove it's last mile and it was time to get a new car. I needed something that would get me back and forth to college and I could pay for with my part-time job. Basically, I drove around looking at any car I could find with a sticker price under 10,000 dollars. Finally, I found a dark green Dodge Colt with a sticker price of 9,900 dollars and I knew it had to be mine.

This cute little two door, 1.5 liter, standard (which I did not know how to drive), power nothing, rack and pinion steering and no AC, was exactly what that 19 year old college student needed. It was a great color green with giant gray bumper was really cute. Convincing my father was not too hard he knew I had to get a new car and he is a Dodge man 100%. I just had to have, even if it meant kicking my dad under the table while he was trying to talk the dealer down. We finally settled at 8,700 dollars because it had been a demo model so it had 1,000 miles on it. My dad did all the paper work and we took it home with me squealing the tires (learned how to drive a standard the hard way) the whole way. I named the cute little guy Dweezil and have very fond college memories of this reliable little car.

LIKES
One of the things that I really liked about this car was of coarse how cute it was it was a cool shade of green and looked pretty sporty (thankfully my taste had changed). The next was the great gas mileage a nice cheap 40 miles to the gallon on average. That really helped with the fact that I went to college 100 miles away and traveled back at least once a month to get my mom to do my wash (giggle). One other nice thing about this car was how much room the trunk had. I fit to truck style kicker boxed and a amp in the trunk and still had room for at least one dead body (I never tried it just a metaphor). Then of coarse it was really nice to have a really small car payment since the price of this car was so darn cheap. I did later learn why they were so cheap.

DISLIKES
One of my major complaints about this car was the lack of power. It really had a lot of problems making it up hills and I always had to pull into the right lane to make sure people could pass me. Not to say that this car did not go fast it just took forever to get there. I also had major problems with the seats in the car they were OK for comfort but within two years they had ripped right at the seam on the drivers side. This was the most used seat but I have had three others cars and never had this problem. My last dislike was the size of the back seat. There was no room at all, not even the average sized person could fit without putting their legs over to the other side of the car. Granted this was a small two door car so what did I expect. 

This really was a good car for the money. In the almost fours years that I owned it I never had to take it in for anything other than regular check-ups. When it came to trading it in I got very little for it mainly because of the lack of AC and torn seat. It had very little mileage on it and I got 4,500 dollars. I was told later that another college student had bought it and I hoped it treated them as well as it treated me. <br><br>
