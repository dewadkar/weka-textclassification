            I've driven a lot of cars in my time, and one that I know well enough to write about is the volvo 940.  I think it is an overall great car.  Not everyone would like the looks of it(I admit it isn't my favorite), but as far as cars go your getting quality for your money.

Last Year, I decided I needed some good affordable transportation.  I went down to my local used car dealer and scouted many makes and models.  I saw a few BMW's, which were a tad bit out of my price range, some SUV's which wasn't really what I needed.  I also saw the 1996 240 which looked like something I could handle, but for some reason the 940 attracted me more.  I opened the door and got inside, eager to give it a test drive.  The ride went pretty smoothly overall, and I realized that this wagon would suit my needs pretty well.  

I spent a  tad bit more than I wanted to, but the quality of the car was good.  The gas mileage wasn't as low as I had hoped, but I wanted a more spacious comfortable ride for less than an SUV.  4wd won't help me any.  The car I got was also an automatic, which made it easier on me.  Other models of this type may have had tinted windows, but mine was without this feature.  I also found it great for the camping trip I went on with my buddies, because the rear seats folded back to fit in with my needs perfectly.

After owning it for a while, I did realize it had about 150,000 miles on it, but I had to go into the shop once to try and get the transmission fixed.  I can't recall the problem, but it was something time created.  I also had a few problems with the tires.  These 17 inchers weren't all they're cracked up to be.  

The bottom line is, if you need a good affordable car that is a little more than most people need, this is for you.  I recommend it to anyone who is planning on hauling a lot of passengers, but don't need or can't afford an SUV.  I also recommend the 240 and 850, because his brother cars can fit your needs as well for a slight better price.<br><br>
