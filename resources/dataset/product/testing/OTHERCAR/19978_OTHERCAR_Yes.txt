            I bought a 1994  Chevrolet Beretta Z26 this past April '01 with 89,000 on it. It has a fast 3100 V6 engine, 4 speed automatic w/ overdrive, and a great looking ground effects/ alloy rim package. Performance is 165 hp/185lb. ft. of torque. Probably one of the most unique looking sport compact cars on the roads today. This is actually my second Beretta. I had a 89 Beretta GT before this. Because these cars are so reliable and so unique looking, I wanted to get another one with more power and features. This car is LOADED with stuff you'd find in a BMW or something (power everything, sunroof ,foglights, etc). It's  also got just as much torque as Porsche 911. The Z26 was the last sport model Beretta made before being discontinued in 1996. I love this car, it is the best handling car I have ever driven. Tight turns are precise and there is very little body roll. From what I hear these cars make decent auto cross competitors. There is also growing fanbase around models like the Beretta GTZ, Z26, GT, and Beretta Indy. These cars are getting harder to find so if you are lucky enough to own one- hang on to it!
