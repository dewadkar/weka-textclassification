            I am a happy owner of a 1996 Chevy S-10 Extended Cab!!  When I was seventeen my parents gave me some options on what kind of cars they would purchase for me and when they told me an S-10 was an option I was happy because I wanted to get a truck.

And since the time I have purchased my truck I have spent a lot of money on improving its looks.  One of the first things I did was to lower it 4 inches in the front and 6 inches in the back.  Then I purchased some sport mirrors and painted them to match my truck.  Then one Christmas my parents purchased a Trader's Bed Cover for me.  Then this past year I bought a new front valance that can hold PIAA Fog lights.  Then the last thing I have done to it is put a custom hood on it.  I am from southern California and the truck scene where I am from is really popular.  I have gotten a lot of comments on how well my truck looks.  The only thing I wish I would have done different when I bought my truck was to get the V6.

On the positive side, I get great mileage,(22-25 mpg), the 4-cylinder is plenty powerful enough to maneuver into traffic, and it looks great, which means that members of the opposite sex won't be frightened off by some funny-looking piece of junk. To anybody who is looking for a fun, functional pick-up at a good price, the S-10 might be right for you. However, if you have the money to up-grade, at least an extended cab is recommended, mainly for the additional room for carrying kids, groceries, tools, and anything else you don't want to leave outside when you're driving.
