            I have owned a 1994 Lexus SC300 for almost 2 years now, and I feel that I should express to the world the glorious car that I drive.

I bought the car used for about $30,000 (two years ago) so I can reasonably assume that they would run around 20-25 thousand these days.

<b>The options</b>

Those with an asterisk are offered as standard on the SC400 and optional on the SC300.  For these purposes, I will mainly discuss the 300 model, but other than the options below, the main difference between these models is the engine.  In the SC400, a V-8 engine is standard and the SC300 is characterized by a V-6.

<b>Leather seats**
Seat warmers**
Moon roof
Power doors, locks, seats
Keyless remote entry
Automatic climate control
Rear and side window defrosters
AM/FM CD
Anti-lock brakes
Driver's side and passenger airbags
Front and rear speakers
Power steering
Electronically controlled transmission (ECT)</b>

<b>Elaboration on some of the above features</b>

1)Power seats:  The driver's side seat can be pre-programed for two separate drivers.  You simply adjust the seat, mirrors, and steering wheel and the computer will save it.  That way, if two people routinely drive the car, they can each save their seat position and recall it with the touch of a button.  The passenger seat is power also, but not programmable.  However, when you are moving the seat up to let someone get in the back seat, it will move up automatically, just as the steering wheel moves back and up when you turn the car off.  These features make getting in and out of the car a complete ease.

2)Climate control/defrosters:  You can manually turn the air and heat on and off, and adjust the intensity, but you can also have the car do it for you.  Simply put the air on "auto" and set the temperature, and the air or heat will continue to blow until it reaches the desired temperature.  A nice feature with the air and heat is that you can turn both the front and rear defrosters on simultaneously with the main air.  The side defrosters are a small feature, but very helpful in that they allow you to see your read view mirrors.

3)CD player: I have a 12-disk player in the trunk (which also hold a first aid kit)  The speakers in front and rear are very high in quality.  You will have no need to replace any of the sound equipment in this car and it is well worth the upgrade.

<b>Some cool features that make this car even better</b>

-Chrome rims with gold trim (very nice with black)

-Moon roof that stops when something is in the way if it closing

-3 odometers (2 of which can be reset at any time)

-rear view mirror glare reduction by electronic tint (very cool)

-Overdrive and power transmission at the touch of a button

<b>Warranty</b>

I bought this car with just over 60,000 miles on it.  The standard factory warranty expires at that mark so I do not know much about the warranty.  Of course you can buy an extended one or add to the one they give you, but it is not likely you will need it.

<b>Final Recommendations</b>

It is always a concern to know how much back seat room there is in a 2-door car.  While you can't throw a party in the back seat of the Lexus SC300, the average person can fit without too much problem, especially because of the tremendous amount of front seat leg room, allowing you to move the seats up considerably.

In two years, I have not once made a trip to the shop for even the most minor of tune-ups.  The parts for the Lexus can only be repaired by a special shop, but I have yet to need their service for any reason.  This car now has almost 76,000 miles on it and is literally the smoothest ride you will find from any car.  Overall, if you are looking for a luxury car, I cannot recommend anything other than the Lexus.  The SC300 is powerful, quick, sporty, classy, and the most quality car I have ever been lucky enough to sit in, much less drive.
