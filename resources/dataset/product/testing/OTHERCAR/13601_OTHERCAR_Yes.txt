            After having an eclipse I discovered what a real automobile was. My dad gave me a 1990 red miata for my 20th birthday. It was the firs 5 speed I have owned and I will never go back to automatic. The car at first glance has beautiful lines for the eyes to follow. The handling of the car is great even when stock. The only problems I have encountered after 2 years was a dead battery after winter storage. The car is actually slow before any modifications.  For the timid its a great car to go on country drives. If you are more wild at heart such as my self, you can have modifications such as turbo chargers for the engine and suspension upgrades to make the car handle better then a Porsche. For any age or any way or driving the Miata is a superior choice for the price it's offered at.<br><br>
