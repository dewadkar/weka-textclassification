            I wanted a vehicle that would be easy and economical to drive in town and on the highway, and provide comfortable seating for at least seven passengers. We need the extra room because of visits with our grandchildren from time to time.  In addition, I am a do-it-yourself person and have occasions to carry material including 4x8 sheets of plywood.  The 1999 Dodge Grand Caravan met all these requirements and more.

We love the way the seats can be easily removed and re installed.  The back seat has rollers on it which makes it easy to move and store in the garage when it is removed from the vehicle.

We love the ride of the vehicle. I have a bad back which gives serious problems in some cars.  We have made several trips of more than 600 miles in a given day in the Caravan without any problems with my back.  There is plenty of head room and leg room which helps greatly.

The primary downside of this vehicle is the lights. The lights do a poor job of illuminating the road particular at highway speeds.

People who want a vehicle that you can use as a luxury car and also a truck should consider the Dodge Grand Caravan.   <br><br>
