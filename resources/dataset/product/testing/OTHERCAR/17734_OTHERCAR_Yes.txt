            I purchased a model year 2000 Saturn early in the spring of 2000 after almost a year of research into similar models, and various other types of vehicles including sport utilities and compact trucks for my wife to drive daily to work.

We have completely satisfied with the car, an SL1, and just took it in for its first scheduled oil change at 5,000 miles.  It makes me nervous that the owner�s manual states that, and the dealership recommends 3,000 miles.  I think I�ll stick with 3,000.  

The car has had no noticeable change in handling or pickup since we purchased it with 3 miles on the odometer. It has the standard front wheel drive oversteer, but that�s to be expected�they just weren�t made to do hard cornering at 45 MPH�yes I�ve done it.  At 5,000 miles, the Saturn looks like it will make 500,000 miles.  

I have a problem with rain coming in when the windows are slightly cracked.  Well, no kidding rain comes in when the windows are open, but hear me out.  In most vehicles I�ve owned you could crack the windows for fresh air and not get your left leg soaked, save hard driving rains.  I think I will put on some Ventvisors�they�ll look neat on the metallic silver car anyway.

The front seats are starting to wear also.  I�m sure that it�s no big deal, and that a certain amount of �fuzz� comes out of every new fabric, but seat covers may be in order.  This is my new car, and I want to keep it that way.

The body and paint have shown its weaknesses in the form of a few dings and scratches.  We have a kid-related chip and dent in the hood that highlights the hood�s steel composition, which couldn�t have been prevented in an all-steel car anyway.  We do have a key scratch on the driver�s side that shows the vulnerability of Saturn�s painting process and paint.  

The way I have come to understand it is most cars are painted with hard enamel-type paint that is then baked onto the car.  This works well when steel is the primary makeup, but flexible parts like the Saturn�s composite shell, require a more flexible paint.  This can lead scuffs, but the dealer reassured me that it has been addressed since Saturn�s introduction.  It�s not like it is going to rust anyway�but that�s my new car, man!

The Saturn technicians were very helpful and made sure that I was taken care of, much the same way as when we picked out and purchased the car.  This has been a good experience so far, and one I�d do again.
