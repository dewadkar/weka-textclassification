            I'll let you in on some of the reasons my wife and I went for the 2001 Nissan Pathfinder LE.

1. Price - While the sticker price can really get up there, you should be able to get a Pathfinder for at or below dealer's invoice (the dealer will just make money on the holdback or rebate).  Most buyers will have very few options.  Most LE's have the leather package as an option, but almost everything else is included in the base price.  In addition, Nissan will have very low APR promotions through the year.  When compared to a Toyota, the Pathfinder will be at least 5K less than a comparable 4Runner and the Highlander will go for close to MSRP.  Our payment for a new Pathfinder is $50 less a month for the same duration than a 2 year old 4Runner we were looking at. 

2. Looks - The Pathfinder had a makeover on its exterior a couple of years ago.  There is little difference between the Nissan and the Infiniti QX4, especially in the gold color.  I like the grill and alloy wheels on the LE model, but the SE has some of the sharpest looking cloth seats.

3. Interior - The Nissan engineers really went to town on the interior.  I especially like the audio controls on the steering wheel.  You can control the volume, track, CD, or switch between CD/FM/AM.  The 8-way power driver's seat with adjustable lumbar support has two memory settings.  You can also set the seat to move back all the way from the steering wheel when the door opens to aid in getting in and out of the car.  It moves back into position when you are ready to go.  This feature is probably best for shorter drivers who sit close to the wheel.  My wife and I (5-7 and 5-10) both drive with the seat all the way back.  I can lean back enough to be comfortable, but I'm not sure how this would work for someone over 6 feet tall.  My model came with a 6-disc in-dash cd changer and an automatic climate control.  Heated seats are standard with the leather package.  There is an automatic setting for the lights so they turn on and off by themselves when appropriate, but automatic locks are not present.  

4. Smooth ride - Compared to the 4Runner, Xterra, and all domestic SUV's, the Pathfinder's ride is very smooth.  However, it does feel more like a truck than Toyota's new Highlander.  The new engine is very powerful and burns a lot of gas.  With its premium fuel requirements and the current gas situation, this adds to the cost of ownership.  Highway driving is a pleasure and cornering ability is decent for a vehicle of this type.
