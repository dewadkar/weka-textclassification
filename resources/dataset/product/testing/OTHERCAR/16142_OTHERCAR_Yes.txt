            Bought A BRAND NEW JEEP GC LTD. IN JANUARY.I CURRENTLY HAVE ABOUT 5000 MILES ON IT AND HAVE HAD A FEW PROBLEMS.FIRST I HAD TO HAVE NEW FRONT BRAKE ROTORS INSTALLED WHICH THE WARRANTY COVERED BECAUSE JEEP HAS HAD PROBLEMS WITH THEM.SECOND, SOMETIMES WHEN STARTING OUT SLOW, WHEN  THE TRANSMISSION SHIFTS IT SLAMS INTO THE NEXT GEAR. THE SERVICE MGR TELLS ME JEEP IS WORKING ON A NEW CHIP TO CURE THIS PROBLEM.ALL IN ALL THIS IS MY 5TH GRAND CHEROKEE AND HAS THE BEST RIDE OF ANY OF THE OTHERS.EVEN THOUGH I'VE HAD A FEW PROBLEMS I WILL PURCHASE ANOTHER ONE IN THE FUTURE.ALSO THE ONE THING THAT BUGS ME THE WORST IS LOUD REAR END.<br><br>
