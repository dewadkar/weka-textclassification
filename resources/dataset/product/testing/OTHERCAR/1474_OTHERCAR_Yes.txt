            I am old enough to remember when Caddies of any age had style and speed, but lately, most of their models have been a bit embarrassing, especially parked next to a Mercedes or BMW. I didn't actually buy the Escalante, but leased it.  Leasing, like the Escalante, suits the modern condition. 

The Escalante, with its big-cojones Northstar engine and smoothly adapted styling, changes all that. Once inside, it's truly a Caddy, with enough luxury options to satisfy any reasonable driver or even the most demanding passenger: great seats, top-end sound system, plus cute touches like the compass in the rear view mirror, etc. And it promises to be tough and reliable as well. Handsome (especially in white), luxurious, fast enough to be fun, and equally comfortable on the freeway, a winding nearly two-lane blacktop road from Salinas to Carmel Valley, and muddy dirt roads in Big Sur, this is a very practical alternative to that cliched luxury sedan you bought last time. Equipped with bulletproof glass and tires, it could become the vehicle selected by nine out of ten major drug dealers in your neighborhood. Seriously, few of them have enough imagination left to select this guy, so your image is probably safe if you actually buy one.

About the only thing my passengers (especially older persons and women in tight skirts) don't like about it is climbing in: perhaps GM could license height-adjustable suspension from Citroen. <br><br>
