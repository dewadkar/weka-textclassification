            I had the good fortune of renting this vehicle for a week last Christmas; I drove the 3.5 V-6.  From the moment I got behind the wheel, I was impressed with what this car had to offer in terms of style and performance.

First things first.  When I pulled off the lot, I forgot that this is a 3900 lb. car with a 215 hp engine.  Normally, that would not be a great combination with all that weight.  The Intrigue, which also uses this engine, is more than a few pounds lighter; thus, it's a bit quicker I'm sure.  I can truthfully say that I didn't FEEL like I was driving a near two-ton car.

The Aurora had strong acceleration and good passing power - a plus when zipping around on Chicago's freeways!  Not much in the way of torque steer, even under hard thrust, but squat and dive are most assuredly present in the driving dynamics.  It added to the sensation of your back being pinned to the seatback cushion.  Good, confident braking - even with a dusting of snow on the ground.  This car inspired driving confidence the way the automotive writers prattle on and on about the European and Japanese luxury brands.  And even with THOSE cars, NONE are perfect (dare I say!).

Cornering was well-controlled; the car never plowed its way through turns.  I never felt that the car was going to "get away" from me - I mean, it felt like it was GLUED to the road!  I say this because I drive rather briskly and I like to toss my car about on twisty roads and highway ramps.  This car handles it ALL with aplomb and quiet composure.

The interior impressed me just as much as if I had sat in a Jaguar, Mercedes, Volvo, or Lexus.  Inside, this car is an utter work-of-art.  Leather and wood EVERYwhere with chrome accents exude a charm that some automakers just can't bring off in their cars.  The Lexus, for example, is certainly luxurious, but seems a bit sterile in its presentation.  A closer comparison is the Acura 3.2 - which is just downright cheap looking.

I rather like the bells and whistles.  Set the seats, mirrors, radio, climate control, etc. and your settings are maintained EVERY TIME you drive.  THIS is FAR more useful than being able to access email or use voice commands or (worse) have the car talk BACK to me.  Call me a purist, but those accessories are just plain ridiculous!  One car-mag used to call over-accessorized cars of the 1970s and early 1980s (Cadillac, OLDSMOBILE, Lincoln) "The Zenith of Wretched Excess"; who knew back in the those days that the term would later apply to the BMW 7-series?

All controls are close at hand and despite having a lot of them, Oldsmobile has managed NOT to end up with an interior festooned with a multiplicity of Chiklet-sized buttons.  The redundant controls on the steering wheel came in handy, but with the dashboard curved toward the driver, I sometimes found myself not using them since the main switches were so close at hand.

The front seats were sublime!  The view outward was helped by the fact that power adjuster allowed me to sit rather high to compensate for a moderate cowl height.  My car also had the optional power passenger seat with lumbar control.  When sitting in either front seat you feel more ensconed rather than sitting on a perch or pedestal - even with the seat at its highest setting.  This was just fine with me.  I have previously leased a couple of Hondas (94 and 96);  the latter had a power height adjustment and STILL gave me the go-cart effect.

The rear seats also gave a sensation of being enveloped, especially with the car's beltline rising gently to meet the C-pillar.  However, the cushion is somewhat low.  And just TRY escaping from back there.  No such thing as a graceful exit - THAT'S for sure.  Blame the huge front "armchairs" in part combined with narrow rear door openings.  Tall people might find "coach" to be just as stingy as an airliner.  At least there's a center armrest.

GM usually provides an excellent stereo, and the Aurora is NO exception.  Great CD player, great speakers with good bass that doesn't sound muffled.

I am currently looking for a used Aurora (2001) because this is one elegant, understated, well-built, solid performing automobile.  It is a SHAME that GM is discontinuing the entire Oldsmobile line.  Heck, if it were ME, I would've sacrificed BUICK instead.  I feel that Olds was not properly or FULLY marketed.
