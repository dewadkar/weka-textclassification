            When it came time to upgrade my Olympus DL-600 I needed to make sure I replaced it with something much better.  While I really enjoyed using the Olympus, I still wanted more�

With the Sony, my resolution increased from 1024X768 to 2048X1538. The quality of the pictures were very sharp and produce a lot of detail.  I even compared my pictures with a similar picture my friend took with his $1,000 Nikon afterwards and we both agreed mine had more detail and was a sharper picture.  Of course printing images out will vary a lot based on the paper and type of printer.  If you intend on using the 6X Zoom, you need to have a VERY steady hand or a tripod.  I tend to move slightly as I press the shutter which tends to cause some of my shots to appear fuzzy.

<b>Battery</b>
The Sony uses InfoLithium battery as opposed to 4 AA�s in my old Olympus.  While I enjoyed the use of the AA�s in other devices, having the battery recharged in the camera has its merits.  Instead of either buying a CostCo/Price Club sized pack of AA�s or buying a rechargeable set just for my camera, you have a dedicated battery that won�t get misplaced or lost during its charging period.  Recharging the Sony is a snap with a cord from the camera to the wall outlet.

<b>Zoom</b>
6X.  What more is there to say?  I�ve doubled my range so I�m quite happy I can get an even clearer picture from further away.  I�m not a camera expert, but an expert, Carl Zeiss developed the zoom lens for Sony.  I�m guessing he is an authority since Sony gave him top billing on their product page.

<b>Storage</b>
The pictures are stored in memory sticks instead of SmartCard Media.  My Olympus can with a 2MB SmartCard and I upgrade to the 8MB Card.  The Sony comes with the 8MB.  My guess is because of the increase in resolution capture has caused an increase in the size of the files to be stored.  A quick search on pricewatch.com will give you the best prices for more memory if you find yourself out of space.  Last Check, 32MB -$52, 64MB-$91.

<b>Transferring</b>
My method of choice is the USB Memory Stick Reader Cable that connects to my USB port.  After you load the driver, your camera shows up just like my Iomega Zip and Jaz drive.  From there, just drag the files you want into the folders on your harddrive or delete the ones that you don�t want or are fuzzy.  My Olympus would connect to my serial port and requires Olympus�s propriety software to access the SmartCard in the DL-600 to download or upload.

<b>Disadvantages</b>
Size-the camera is big.  I find myself only wanting to bring it with my on special occasions or when I know something interesting is going to happen.  Otherwise I keep a disposable camera in my car for quick snapshots.
Power-Up Cycle � The camera takes a good 6 seconds to power up which can cause you to miss the fast action shots if it does a self shutdown.  When I know I need to catch a fast picture, I have to keep the camera in hand and press the shutter down halfway every few minutes.  Sometimes I take pictures of people just standing around since I�m not really wasting anything.  Hey, its digital!  If you don�t want it, delete it.

<b>Overall</b>
In a nutshell, I really like the new Sony DSC-S70.  While the camera itself is kind of big compared to some of the new smaller digital cameras, they pale when it comes down to the features and quality of pictures.  Being able to record MPEG�s is a big hit during company functions like softball games when your co-workers make the fatal error that costs you the game.  It�s also a great hit a family functions but then everyone wants you to e-mail them the file.  In regards to its size, I recommend going to a camera store and get a good quality camera bag to carry everything in.
