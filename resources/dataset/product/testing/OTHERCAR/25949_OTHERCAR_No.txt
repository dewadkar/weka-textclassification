            I purchased this Pontiac Grand Am because I was an owner of a Pontiac Sunbird and I wanted an upgrade.  Since I was very happy with my Sunbird, and hardly had any problems with it, I decided to purchased a Grand Am. I wanted a more sporty looking car.   I also really liked the new look and style of the car.  I have had nonstop problems since I purchased this car.  I have only had my car 8 months.  I have had a leak in the trunk, but didn't realized it until I had a flat tire. When I went to change it, the tire in the trunk was in water.  When I pulled the tire out, I noticed the jack was under water and was all rusted. I couldn't even use it to change the tire. I have had my car in 4 times, because my transmission keeps leaking.  I've had problems with the seals around the doors and had those changed.  I had the passenger side window replaced because it was scratching when rolled down. I had the driver's side window and regulator replaced because the window just dropped when parked one day.  I had the steering gear replaced on the bottom of the car.  It sounded like the whole bottom of the car was going to fall off.  And I had the brakes fixed.

Bottom line is, I would not recommend this car to anyone.  I bought it because it is a good looking car, and it is.  It has just been a real headache for me with all the problems.<br><br>
