            I have held out on buying a decent digital camera over the years as there are still many issues regarding output, ease of use and durability.  As my only use for a digital camera was for occasional website use or Ebay pictures, I got by with the little Aiptek Pen Cam.  Recently though, my wife, who is a real estate agent, wanted to start posting photos of her home listings on her website.  It was time for a good quality digital camera.

The Sony CyberShot DSC-P71 was a good choice.  Sony has many years of experience in the digital camera field as well as in the digital storage field.  These two attributes stand out and are well represented in the CyberShot DSC-P71.

The camera is light and compact at 1.7 inches deep, 2.3 inches high, 4.9 inches wide and 10 ounces. If you have large hands you may find it a bit too small. However, its size does make for easy transport and light weight. It has built in strobe flash with a maximum distance of 12 feet and minimum of 1.6 feet. 

Powered is provided by 2 rechargeable AA Nickel-Metal Hydride batteries and comes with a recharger.  Apparently the unit can use regular alkaline AA batteries, but it may not run as long as the Nickel-Metal Hydide.  This capability is a good feature, as it makes it much easier to find emergency power while away from the charger.  Battery life is fair to good and can reach well over an hour, depending view screen, focus and flash use.

The camera has a fairly strong 6x optical/digital zoom and offers a surprising field of view for such a small camera.  The camera auto focuses quickly with a half press of the shutter button.  When turned off the lens contracts and a lens cover closes quickly. 

The 1.5 inch color LCD viewer is sharp and easy to see and controls are generally easy to use.  The one exception being the down press (OK) of the circular navigator button.  It is hard to depress the button accurately, with the unit often misinterpreting your press and Canceling instead of Entering.

One of the strengths of the Sony CyberShot DSC-P71 I believe is the Sony Memory Stick storage medium. The Memory Stick is small yet easy to handle.  It comes in various sizes including 8MB, 16MB, 32MB, 64MB and 128MB.  The unit comes standard with the 16MB.  I bought mine with a 128MB.  At its highest pixel and image size setting of 2048x1536 the 16MB stick will hold 10 photos, the 128MB will hold 80.  However, bear in mind that most users, including myself do not really have a need for such large mega pixel images. Especially if you are posting to a website.  A more useful pixel/size of 1280x960 with yield 44 images on the 16MB stick and a whopping 372 on the 128MB stick.  

I was pleasantly surprised to see how the USB connectivity setup so easily on Windows XP.  Installation on Win XP is fast and easy.  To upload your images, just plug in the USB cable to the Camera and Windows launches its dialog.  Very easy.

I found the manual well written, which is a rare thing these days.  This is a good thing as the CyberShot DSC-P71 has an abundance of features.  Without the strong manual it would be a challenge to figure many of the features out. However, most of the time the features are not needed for our use. After a few weeks you soon master all you need on this camera.  

With the '02 Christmas shopping season coming up, the Sony CyberShot DSC-P71 will no doubt be a hot item. Maybe look for a post New Years sale of Ebay sale! Sony CyberShot DSC-P71 is a good value and represents a quality camera at a not too steep a price.
