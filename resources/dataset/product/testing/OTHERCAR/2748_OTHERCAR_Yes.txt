            We had recently purchased a house and needed a small pickup truck to haul yard stuff etc. We decided on a new truck because we needed something truly reliable since we had just bought a house and didn't want repair bills. We ended up purchasing the base model: no rear bumper, no stereo, no power windows etc. but we have not regretted it since! We now have 125,000 miles on this little truck and have had NO repairs! It rides well, starts every time, and we're planning on keeping it for years to come!
The only thing that has broken so far is the driver's sunvisor mount. The plastic just gave out one day and the thing came crashing down.
I would recommend this truck to anyone who needs a small truck that is reliable...perfect!<br><br>
