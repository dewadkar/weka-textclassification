            I bought this car new in July of 2002. It was initially intrigued by it's price and, of course, canvas top. When I test drove the car, I really liked being up high and found that it drove well. So after a lot of thought, I went with it. 
  Currently, the car has about 16,000 miles on it. I have only had one minor problem with it - cold starts. Although it wasn't really cold, as the problem occurred in August. For about 2 weeks, if the car was off for more than 5 hours, it wouldn't start, or it would start and then die shortly thereafter. It would take me 3 or 4 tries to get it started. Of course, by the time I got it into the dealership to have it looked at, it wasn't doing it anymore. Still, they looked the car over and found nothing to be wrong. 
  Other than that, there have been no problems. My complaints about the Kia are more annoyances than huge problems. I see that a lot of people mentioned the small size of the glove compartment, which is absolutely true. If you arrange everything right, though, you can fit a lot in there - I keep the thick owners manual, 2 maps, a notepad, tissues & cell phone charger. The fabric & plastic interior is rather cheap-feeling, but nothing has fallen apart or ripped yet. On the inside, the engine is fairly quiet, but if your windows are down, you will definitely hear *a lot* of rattling from the outside. My biggest annoyance of the Kia is this weird kick thing it does. Sometimes when I'm stopped, I'll step on the gas to accelerate and it won't go, then all of a sudden, it will jerk forward. 
  One of my big concerns before buying was the small amount of trunkspace - but don't worry, you can fit a lot more than you'd think! Plus with the seats down, there is tons of room, and since the top comes off, you can fit things that are tall in there, too. Like I said, one of the things that originally drew me to the sportage was the canvas top. The day I brought it home, the first thing I did was take it off. The wind is great! My only complaint is that if you're in the front, the roof is still over your head, so it's not the same as being in the back...but you can still feel it from the back, and the front windows are HUGE, so when they're rolled all the way down, you get the gist with all the sun & extra wind on your head. The canvas top took a while to get back on the first few times, but once I got the hang of it, I could do it in less than 5 minutes. Plus, the car looks great - sometimes when I'm walking to it, I can't believe it's mine!
  Overall, I've had a love/hate relationship with my car. This car is my second car, and I think it makes a really good first or second car. When I bought the car, I was just out of college, 22, and it was summer and it was a young, fun car. Now I might choose a more reliable, practical car for the same price, but you're only young once, so I went for it!
