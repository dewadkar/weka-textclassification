            In 1996 was looking for a small xtra-cab style pickup, and the Ford Ranger's were too expensive (at the time). The Presidents' Day sale at the local Toyota dealership offered 1.9% financing (tremendous at the time), so the price was right. I purchased a black 4x2 Xtra Cab Tacoma LX with most of the options except for the electronic convenience package, which means I don't get power windows/locks or a clock.

Overall it's ok--it holds its own, has pretty decent acceleration, and can handle a load like nobody's business. I've put some punishingly heavy home improvement type loads in the bed (over the rail bedliner came with my truck), and the chassis and suspension handle just fine. Gas mileage is pretty constant too, regardless of the payload.

However, the fit and finish have always left something to be desired, which is odd for Toyota. I have had numerous problems with the outer window track moulding peeling off of the body metal, seatbelts that won't retract properly, seatbelts that won't latch properly, and a curious dead-of-summer vapor-lock condition that shouldn't be possible with fuel injection. At least I purchased the Toyota Care Extended Warranty, as all of the problems have been fixed thus far. The main complaint, however, is that each of these problems has had to be addressed at least 4 times, as the problems keep occurring.
