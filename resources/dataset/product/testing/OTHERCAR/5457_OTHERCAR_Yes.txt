            Engine:
The LS integras are powered by a 1.8L DOHC 4 cylinder engine. Just like any other Honda, it needs to be revved high to enter its powerband (peak hp is achieved around 6300 rpms, and on the GSR models, its even higher... maybe around 7600). But even if you're a mild-mannered, conservative driver, the tiny 1.8L engine will move the car at a decent pace at any engine speed. But for spirited driving or passing cars on the freeway, you really need to rev the motor above 3500 rpms.

Transmission:
I frequently drive in the NJ/NY metro area, and through the coercion of my parents, I got the automatic transmission. Its shifts are smooth and there is no gear-hunting on inclines, but I would have much rather gotten the 5-speed manual transmission. In my opinion, the auto shifts too quickly under low throttle conditions, before any substantial torque becomes available. Besides, a 5-speed is so much more fun to drive. No problems with the auto transmission, though.

Exterior:
The Integra comes with a 3-layer paint finish from the factory. I've gone through 3-4 car washes since I bought my car, and the black paint still looks amazing. Each time I look at my freshly cleaned car, it nearly brings tears to my eyes. The curves and lines flow very smoothly from front to back, and the appearance of this car was one of my reasons for buying this car.

Interior:
The bucket seats are comfortable and hug your body nicely on turns. Everything is clearly marked, and easily accessable. Room up front is adequate, though two tall people may experience a little discomfort in the rear (their heads may actually touch the glass of the hatchback). I am only 5'5 and do not have to worry about that. Unfortunately, the problem I do have is that since I need to move the seat forward, the seatbelt and power window controls are in somewhat awkward positions (i need to reach FAR back for the seatbelt, and the window control is in an unnatural position for me... i have to think about where they are). Oh, and the cupholders pretty much suck (way too small to hold any real drink, and very close to the shifter). You'll (as many others have) end up finding another place to store drinks (i recommend the armrest storage bin).

Ride quality:
The road noise gets a little loud at high speeds, but i'll accept it. The lighter weight (less sound dampening), stiffer shocks/springs, and variable power steering give a slightly harsher ride than some like, but it's supposed to be. This isn't a luxury car, it's a sports coupe. Personally, I enjoy the one-with-the-road kind of control and drivability that comes with a car such as this. I feel connected when I drive this car, and that's definately a plus. I smile when I drive on freshly paved streets, and cry when driving over unavoidable potholes. 

It's not the fastest, nor the cheapest, but it's still a damn good car and I love it anyway.
