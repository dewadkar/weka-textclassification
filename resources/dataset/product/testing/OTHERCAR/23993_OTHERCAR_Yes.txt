            On a recent family trip to visit the grandparents, our Aggie maroon Honda, fondly referred to as Scooter, turned over 100,000 miles! Scooter has served our family well, but since we have acquired two wiggley youngsters, and all their possessions, we've finally decided to graduate to a mini-van, and relegate Scooter to dad's &quot;driving to work car&quot;. Please keep in mind that this Epinion is written from a mom's point of view that just recently learned to put gas in the car. OK, I'm kidding about that, but you get the point. 

<b>Upkeep and Service</b>: Our 1992 Accord LX is the first new car I've ever owned and it has served up well. Up keep is rather simple. We follow the maintenance schedule, which we got with the car. I really like this little gizmo on the dash board that turn yellow (warning), then red when it is time to change the oil and take it in for usual maintenance. The required maintenance prices were usually around $20, with one at it's five year birthday that was $600.00 (yikes!). We're on the second set of tires. Other expenses have included a new timing belt and replacement of some expensive piece that was cracked which was making a horrible creaking sound.
 
<b>Scooter's Stuff</b>: Let's see. This car has four wheels and is a 4-cylinder - I think. It has an automatic transmission and two cup holder in the front. It has automatic door locks, mirrors and windows, and a decent stereo. The AC works great, for now, but has been fixed twice. It also has a clock, odometer, speedometer, gas pedal, brake pedal, gray upholstery, a trip odometer, a cigarette lighter and a bunch of nooks and crannies to hold spare change, garbage, tapes, juice boxes, pacifiers and Hot Wheels Cars. 

<b>Self-Inflicted Wounds</b>: In 1993 the car was hit by a pick-up from behind and run into a culvert. All three people inside were wearing seat belts are fine. The driver-side air bag did not deploy, so, thankfully, I can't comment on its effectiveness. The damage to the care was about $3000.00 and everyone was surprised how will the frame held up. I recall being told when we bought this car about how the back end is designed in an accordion fashion so it sort of rumples the trunk up in an attempt to keep the passengers safe. This car was also involved in a low speed head-on collision with a telephone pole. The damage was $1500.00. It seems that relatively small fender-benders in Honda's are expensive to fix! 

<b>The Honda and Kids</b>: When we had our first child, we put the car seat in the middle. The base to the carrier type seats fit perfectly, as did the bigger car seats and booster seat. With a seat installed in the middle, however, there is not room on the sides for an adult to sit comfortably for a long period of time (or short for that matter!). When we had our second child we had to install a booster seat on one side and a baby carrier seat on the other. The booster seat fits fine, but the baby seat is a nightmare. The back seats of the car slope down toward the back so it is very hard to properly install a backward facing baby car seat. Even when we use towels to elevate it, (as the manufacturer suggests) the baby seat indicator is still barely in the acceptable range. As far as adult comfort goes, the back seats are very comfortable and reasonably roomy! 

Travel around town in the Honda is quite comfortable with the kids. It has a huge trunk and all kinds of strollers fit easily into - even those huge double ones! Long distance with two kids in the Honda provides just a bit too much togetherness for our family. We could really use a couple of cup holder in the back seat. The back of the front seats has pockets on them, which provide a handy place for the kids to stash their stuff. 

<b>Personality Defects</b>: This car seems to have acquired its share of weird personality defects. When the left signal is on a little whistling sound is heard. The letters on the gearshift stopped lighting up several years ago, but will intermittently come on if you hit the gearshift panel with your fist. Also, in the winter, the entire car seems to sort of creek. I donï¿½t think the doors are going to fall off or the engine's going to fall out, but the sound is a bit disconcerting! I've been told this is common for older Hondas. If anyone has anything to say about these weird noises, I'd really like to hear it! 

So, Scooters about to be relegated to a 40 miles round trip commute through Dallas Monday through Friday. Her days in the carpool and to swimming lessons are coming to an end. We still hope to get another 100,000 miles or more out of her. She has served me well and now we're considering replacing her with a Honda Odyssey. Thank you for all your hard work Scooter, and I'm really sorry about that telephone pole!
