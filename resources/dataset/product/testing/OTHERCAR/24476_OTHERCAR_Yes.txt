            I own a 1991 Toyota Cressida GLX in Turkey. She is Super Gray in colour. She has a manual T/A and fully airconditioned. Altough She doesn't have alloy wheels i never thought of changing the standart wheel covers. She has a lot of room inside even at the back. The clothing of the seats or the inner panel is very avantgarde i quess. Also she is the most exciting car among our Mercedes's or BMW's even other Toyota's I have ever driven!. Eventhough I like Toyota i always have felt sad about people are talking about other brands being perfect or etc. Now i invite them in my Cress. and they go nuts while having enourmous pile of horsepowers with the thrilling fully differential locked rear wheel drive system during having the Mercedes comfort, BMW's sport utility and that amazing CORVETTE SOUND!!!!!. I don't think any amount of money can seperate me and HER! ;)<br><br>
