            First off, I had a large SUV prior to buying this, and I must say, I am thrilled with my decision.

Let's be honest -- this car is a re-badged Nissan Sentra with spiffy upgrades, leather and a Bose sound system.  However, a number of differences are apparent immediately.

This car, unlike the Sentra, is built in Japan, not in a factory here.  There were fewer G20s made than Sentras, so the car does not have that mass-production feel to it.

The exterior is awesome.  I'm 27, and with my G20 Sport, I don't feel like I'm driving in a little box.  The seats are comfortable as can be, and all of the dashboard necessities are placed very well.

The stereo is great and having the CD changer under the front seat makes changing CDs easy.  

All of the mirrors are adequately sized and there are virtually NO blindspots with this car.  What a pleasure!

My G20 handles beautifully; at slow speeds or high speeds, I have never felt like I was losing control of the car.  The 16" tires hold the road very well.

The trunk in this car is HUGE.  One would not think a car this size would have a trunk this big.  A friend and I went Christmas shopping for hours and hours, then stopped at the grocery store...and everything fit nicely into the trunk.

The gas mileage has been superb as well.  I only use regular gas (usually Shell) and have averaged 27mpg in the city and nearly 34mpg on the highway.  I couldn't be more pleased.

My car has almost 20,000 miles on it and it's only been to the dealer for oil changes and the 15,000 mile checkup.  The Infiniti dealership has been fantastic.  I am treated very, very well each time I stop in.  The loaner car for any kind of scheduled service is superb.  Not having to sit around and wait for your car is such a pleasure.  During my last oil change, I went to a few stores and got some errands done.  I'm pretty busy...having the loaner is always great.

OK -- What needs improvement?

The cupholder situation is terrible.  There's one under the dash that can barely hold a can (I use mine for change) and the other is in the center console.  That's fine, but I like to rest my right arm on the console while I drive...so the cupholder there is useless.

The car could use some more power.  Off the line it is slow, but once you're moving, the car speeds along quite well.  The tranny is smooth and quiet.

Overall, I would (and have!) recommended this car to friends.  I have the sport model, and I absolutely love it.  It's a shame this car will no longer be made, but when it's time for a new car, I have no doubt that Infiniti will win my business again.
