            The Fuji FinePix A101 is a serious tool for making clear concise photography. It has the power and efficiency to handle the demand of professional photographers needs, while it puts the pleasure of simply great photographing back in the hands of amateur photographers.

I had originally intended to purchase the Finepix as an inexpensive camera for my wife to use. My wife is not a photographer, however I just showed her which button to push and she now takes perfect photos.

The camera offers a duality in perspective of photo capabilities.  It has a fully automatic range of settings for flash and sensory which is necessary for my wife's photo pleasure. The second perspective is that it is a completely flexible camera in the way a photographer can manually set the camera to perform under different ambience and intensities.  It is after all a 100% 35mm camera and senses at a range of 1/2". 7 square pixel length CCD or otherwise known as 1.3 mega pixels.  I can set these sensory options to make photos of up to 1280x960 (fine) or 640x480 (normal) pixels. This Camera can also sequence up to 20 seconds of video without sound.  

One of the Greatest benefits about the FinePix is it's size in conjunction to it's power. The FinePix does a heavy weight job of taking up to 200 high quality normal photos using 3volt NImH batteries and a 64mb Smart Media Card, while weighing in at only 145 grams (5oz.).

Here are just a few more of the benefits of the FinePix A101:
200 normal quality photos which are worth five rolls of 35mm film, This camera has a power saving feature which will more than amply allow for this feature to produce even more photos of a smaller pixel length. 

The FinePix auto or manual focus Range is from 2.6 ft to infinity with either the automatic or manual 6 modes of white balance. It has an automatic or manually set flash built in.

The FinePix is one of the smallest cameras in the world, which includes a 1.6-inch (55,000 pixels) color LCD monitor. This Monitor zooms in for close up photography

The FinePix connects to most PC computers under Windows  via USB port to download your photos to an online photo developer lab or to email them to friends.

The FinePix comes with simple  software , and easy to read manuals

The FinePix shoots up to 20 seconds of video (no Sound )

The FinePix can be used  as a Web cam for online video conferencing.

The FinePix is the most powerful camera in its digital camera size bracket 3.9 x 2.5 x 1.6 inches.


I am a nonsmoker, but as most tee shirts and sweaters sometimes come with that smoking pocket for cigarettes than what better a place for this small and powerful camera.
Now when someone seeing the bulge in that smoking pocket, asks me for a cigarette I pull out the FinePix and take a snapshot of a disappointed would be smoker.

What is really smoking about the FinePix is it's low retail price, and cost effectiveness as a digital camera in comparison to the cost and quality of the other brands.

There are very many different ISO accessories that will fit the camera, which means they are all not necessarily manufactured by Fuji, Although Fuji does have everything you will need to get an inexpensive start with the best small camera on the digital camera market. 

You will find that OTHER Camera manufacturers make only proprietary accessories for their cameras, and other accessories won't fit their cameras, but that's never a problem with a Fuji FinePix Camera.


I had originally purchased the Fuji FinePix as an easy camera for the wife to use, but now instead I prefer it to the heavier power models I own. It has the power to do the job, and the size that makes taking it with you easier.

I am totally Happy with the Fuji FinePix A101 Camera :-)
