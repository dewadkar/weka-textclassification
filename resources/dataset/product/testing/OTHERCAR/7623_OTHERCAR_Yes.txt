            I bought this car from my father in 1998 (he turned around and bought a 1998 Jimmy) and have loved driving it ever since.  It has been in my family for 4 years now and it has only required routine maintenance.  I have put 37,000 miles on it in 22 months and have loved every mile. It is more reliable than anything I have had before and I have been very impressed with it.  My father is a car fanatic and has about 50 cars in his 53 years of life and has been driving Jimmys for 4 years now and has no plans to trade it in.  It has handled wonderfully in all sorts of weather conditions and since I live in northern Illinois, I have used the 4WD fairly often in the winter.

I would definitely recommend the Jimmy to one and all.  It is a great SUV and is worth its low price!
