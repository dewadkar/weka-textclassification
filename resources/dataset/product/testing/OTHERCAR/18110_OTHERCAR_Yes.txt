            &gt;&gt;Why did you buy this vehicle?

I've always had a thing for the Contour/Mystique line.  My senior year in high school, my folks and I found one at the local Ford House as a program car.  It's almost identical to the one in the picture on the main page.  

&gt;&gt;Describe what you love and hate about this vehicle.

Love:  styling, handling, front-seat room and comfort, customizability.

The car looks great, handles great, and has enough front-seat room for even a big ole boy like me.  Plus, it's not hard to add features such as a new stereo, custom rims, or strobe lights to it.  Not that I would do that, of course.  ;o)

Hate:  4-cylinder engine, almost no back-seat room.

The 4-cylinder engine in this car is great...  if you want a 4-cylinder engine.  However, after driving this car for 3 years and then driving my parents' new 3.0L V6 Taurus SE, I would prefer a V6, thank you.  But, as for this engine in particular, power in the upper RPM's is good, and fuel economy is above average.  Also, the back-seat is just a rumor.  I don't think there really is one.  But, since I rarely have more than one other passenger, it's a non-issue for me.  People-movers might prefer a Taurus instead.

&gt;&gt;What is it like to drive this vehicle?

Again, power is lacking off the line, but it's ok for a 4-cylinder.  Most of all, I like the feel of driving a small car without being cramped.  I mean, hey, I drive 40-foot passenger buses all day.  It's nice to be able to throw this little car around once in a while.

&gt;&gt;Who should buy this vehicle? Who shouldn't?

Should:  folks who don't mind using the back seat as storage or the kids seats rather than transporting full-size adults.  Folks that like getting good gas mileage.  Folks that like to tinker.

Shouldn't:  Hot-rodders.<br><br>
