            I bought a Corolla in 1995.  It was my first car and is still my only car.  My parents purchased the car for me because it was relatively cheap, and much more sturdy than a Honda Civic.  Toyota Corolla is probably one of the most reliable cars anyone can purchase.  I would recommend that parents buy their children this car to ensure their safety and general well-being.  

My Corolla has only broken down once in five years, and that was due to a problem with my alternator.  I have had a few flat tires, but never any major problems.  Maintaining a Corolla is pretty inexpensive.  Corolla parts are expensive, since it is a foreign car.  However,it is rare that you will ever have to replace any parts except for routine tune-ups and maintanence.  

I love driving my Corolla because it has an excellent stereo system.  My uncle owns a BMW and his stereo does not sound as great as mine. I recently installed a six -cd changer, and the stereo surround is almost as great as my home stereo system.  

I also find the car very easy to handle and manuever.  My brakes are also excellent, however, no matter how new your brakes are they still squeak. I have also been in two minor accidents, and my car has only been slightly dented.  Who would think that a little car like the Corolla would stand up to sturdier cars?

This car is a definite buy for students, people living on limited income, and people who want to keep their cars for a very long time. This car is great on gas, especially since gas prices have skyrocketed.<br><br>
