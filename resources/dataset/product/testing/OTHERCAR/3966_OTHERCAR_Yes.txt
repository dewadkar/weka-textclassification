            I bought the Saturn because I have read so much about it and am very fond of it.  I love what I have learned about the Saturn. I Didn't believe how great the Saturn was until I drove it and heard what the dealers had to say about it.  I mean I didn't believe that a car could drive that great and not cost a arm and a leg.  I got every thing I wanted on the car without having to pay so much money.  I really needed a car and the Saturn was the only one that I truly loved and thought was good for me.

What I love about the Saturn is that they have great cars.  It was so hard for me to choose which one to buy.  I loved the Ls 2 but the 3-door coupe is hot and no other car dealer makes that.  So I test drove both to see which I liked better.  You wouldn't believe it they drive almost the same. So I still had a really hard choice to make.  There's nothing I hate about Saturn.  The only thing that I don't really like is that if you get like the blackberry color they don't have black leather.  Maybe that doesn't really matter.  But if I have a blackberry car I would love to have black leather not tan.  But that's not a really big issue.

To drive the Saturn to me is just like floating on clouds.  I have never been in a car that has driven any smoother.  This is just a great car.  I never would have thought I could fall in love with a car.  That may sound funny but it's the truth.  I love that car. It is so great. 

Another reason I bought the Saturn is becuase of the way the dealers are.  They were so helpful.  They were nice and ust wanted to help.  They have a lot of great options with the Saturn. The warrenty is great.  Basically you geet what you pay for and then some.

I think that a person that wants a comfortable car that they can rely on to do anything should buy the Saturn.  I looked at the trunk and it is unbelieveable.  I have never seen a car with a trunk that was that huge.  The back seats of the car even fold down.  It is a great family car and the 3-door coupe is cute.  It is just a must have type of car. I would just try out the car. Because Saturn has this 30-day buy back guarntee. SO if you aren't satisasfied within 30-days you can get your money back.  but I think you will be satisfied.<br><br>
