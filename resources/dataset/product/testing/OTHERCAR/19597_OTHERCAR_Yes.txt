            Okay, we are talking rust and dent resistant side panels here.  Don't we all wish we had that on our cars?  There are a lot of other great specs with this car.  Her are some facts and my test drive experience with the Saturn SC2 model.

You have the optional ABS break system, and optional traction control, keyless entry, automatic or standard as some of your options.  The car I drove had the CD player, a premium sound system, and the sun roof with no leakage whatsoever.  This car is very very fun to drive, and I really wish I had one.  The car I am referring to here belongs to my best friend and I do get to drive it often.  I feel the car is very reliable, and it is cute.

It runs very quietly, but something I would like to see is better comfort.  The seats are not that comfortable.  For the almost $20,000 price on this car, I would also like to see automatic windows or locks.  One of the two would be nice.

Now, with the SC2, you get a twin-cam engine, variable effort steering, spotty suspension, aluminum wheels, fog lights, spoiler, and a leather wrapped steering wheel. The road grip is excellent, and has awesome acceleration.  

The seats are rather close to the floor.  I find it kind of difficult to get out of the car, especially when parked too close to a curb. The seats aren't that sturdy either.  On the passenger seat of my friend's car, one of the springs like to come undone and the seat cannot be slid forward.

This is a great car, my friend enjoys it and safety wise, it scores an 11 on the insurance safety scale which is probably one of the best scorings I have seen.  I recommend this car to beginner drivers because of safety and if you like speed, good acceleration and style, here ya go.
