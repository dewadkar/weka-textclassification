            This camera is one of the greatest cameras I have ever had.  I got this camera about 3 months ago and I really love it.  It has so many great features,some of them are:  10x optical zoom, auto focus, up to 2.5 hours or 2000 shots of battery life, you can program AE, has many picture effects, can copy pics, you can email pics,  has three different flashes, can control the brightness, and much more.  I got this camera because I needed to take individual pics of people in a group and print them all out on a piece of paper and this has been great for that.  It takes great pictures of people because you can pick the right flash for the right light.  It also takes great pictures of mountains and other scenic stuff, I have used it a lot for that too. Also I enjoy that I don't have to get film developed because all of the pictures are on a disk you I can put them on the computer and e-mail.  All around this is a great camera. <br><br>
