            Our car is a 1990 Geo Prizm 4 door hatchback. 

<b>Some good points--</b>

It has nice blue paint overall, there is some rust around the headlights and around the fender area but that is to be expected (We get hard winters here and there is a lot of road salt used which corrodes the paint).  The seats in it are very nice, just the right amount of support without being so hard it feels like you're sitting on a board.  They are very comfortable to sit in for road trips, the only seats that I have sat in that were more comfortable than these are the seats in my grandmother's Cadillac.

When my daughter first got her driver's license she learned to drive with a stick shift in this car, so you can expect how much the poor transmission has gone through.  Even in spite of this, the car is at 150,000 miles and the transmission is still running like new.  It has a power sunroof that we have had no problems with, it retracts nicely without any jumps or skips--very smooth.  

This car gets great gas mileage, almost 40 mpg highway.  The doors and hood slam shut with a nice solid "thunk" and they are nicely sized so that you hardly ever have to worry about hitting the cars on either side of you when you are parked in a lot.  Lots of storage space in the back too due to the hatchback.

<b>Now the bad points--</b>

We have had this vehicle for less than a year and already we have had to replace the brakes, and the front speakers still do not work after many professional attempts to fix them.  This car leaks water inside when it rains, or even if it drizzles a bit water drips through the sunroof.  We can't take it to a car wash because the water goes through every single door or window seam there is on the car that hasn't been loaded with silicone sealant.  

This car is sluggish and slow, and the engine skips and jumps when going up hills.  One of the headlights is coming off, and several things in the interior are either cracked or broken off entirely, although we do not know if this is something wrong with the manufacturing on the car or if it was just the way the previous owner treated it. 

Though the seats are very comfortable, that doesn't mean that there is lots of room.  The manufacturer has tried to make this as roomy inside as possible, and they have succeeded as much as possible.  But still, this car was not meant for anyone over 5'8".  

*******Update*******
   On Valentines day 2001 we were in an accident which involved 3 cars, totalled them (including the Prizm) but everyone is okay.  The most serious thing that was wrong with us was that we were sore for the next few days.  I'm glad we were in the Prizm, it had a lot of crumple room and was pretty sturdy in terms of frame strength.  It just might have saved our lives, so I'm going to say thanks to it and add to my opinion that it is a safe car.
