            My wife and I had been discussing a new car for some time.  Currently we have a 95 Jeep Wrangler, air lockers front and rear, taller suspension and a 95 Land Rover Defender 90 with a taller suspension that we use quite a bit off road and also as our daily drivers.  We have been checking out all types of cars from four-doors to coupes, American made and foreign made.  Last week I happened to be at a family reunion and my twin brother arrived in his 98 Eclipse GS-T.  WOW!!  Upon arriving home that evening I got on the internet and did a search on the Eclipse.  I was directed to the nearest dealer and they contacted us the next morning to say that they had several 2000 Eclipse's to choose from including the convertible.  After work that evening my wife and I arrived at the dealership and fell madly in love with a black 2000 Eclipse GT with the premium package and the automatic.  We took it for a test drive and were hooked.  We immediately signed all the papers and drove it home.
After driving two soft top vehicles year round here in Washington state it was a joy to drive a car that had no squeaks, no air leaks or fabric flapping and you could actually hear the other person talk.
Yesterday we took it over the North Cascade loop highway and back home again for a total trip mileage of around 500 miles.  Our gas mileage was just a bit over 30 mpg.  And that was with the air conditioner going for most of the trip.
The response from the V-6 engine is great.  Our trip went from sea level to 5500 feet and the engine was smooth with plenty of power on the mountain passes.  The leather seats are very comfortable and I really like the ability to adjust the drivers seat with the flip of a switch.
The cockpit layout is wonderful.  I like the display for the clock and the stereo.  You don't have to take you eyes off the road to check the radio or disc settings.
The finish of the vehicle both inside and outside is very good.  As I mentioned earlier, we have no squeaks or rattles.  It is the quietest car we have ever owned.  The second day after we bought it I went back to the dealer and bought a bra and mud flaps.  The factory mud flaps fit  perfectly and took only about 30 minutes to install.  The bra fits great and was also an easy install.  Both greatly improve its sport appearance and hopefully will add some protections against rock and dirt damage.
I get a rush each time I look at the car.  I love its lines and styling.  I really like the fact that it has no chrome on it.  
We couldn't be happier with our purchase.  We also purchased the extended warranty to 75K so that added some to the purchase price.  The dealer subtracted most of the warranty cost to bring the price back down.  But I feel that an extended warranty is a must on any car so is worth the additional expense.
I am extremely happy with the engines power range.  The auto transmission is smooth and I am getting the hang of using it in the manual shift mode.  Having never driven an Eclipse with a turbo I can't make a comparison between the two engine types, but to say the V6 is everything plus some.
With Washington State sales tax and license, and the extended warranty the final price of the car was close to $29,000.  And we are very pleased and excited about our first Eclipse.  So, if you are ever in the Redmond, Washington area and see a very happy couple driving a beautiful black 2000 Eclipse GT, gives us a wave.<br><br>
