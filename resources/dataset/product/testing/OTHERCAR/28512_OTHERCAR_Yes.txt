            Remember when you could pull the key out of the ignition and the car would stay running?  How about the time you cranked her over and the car started but the starter stayed running as well?  

I have read a fair amount of the praises for the early 900 Saabs and some of the newer 900 body Saabs, and then along comes the 9-3. 

This is nothing like the early body 900 and for that I am glad with the exception of old style 900 convertible, this car is so much more car.

I worked as a tech on the earlier cars and the cars of today are far less mechanically needy.  Most of the little idiosyncrasies are gone and for the most part you need gas/oil/coolant and road. 

What is really likeable from my technical perspective is that these cars are very trouble free and require only modest attention, and can easily haul lots of stuff.  There are some things that may have owners bothered but for most part Saab has remedies.

Normal complaints are:

Sticking rear door handle and there is a service bulletin to fix this.

SID display is breaking up and this is a quick replacement item.

Squeaking front suspension and there is a service bulletin that addresses this complaint.

Remotes in op and the remotes are quite fragile and susceptible to moisture damage, and if the dealer finds water inside your remote you will have to pay.

The windows on the convertible leak when the car is washed.  The windows/top seals have some adjustment and can be sealed well enough that you could drive through an automatic car wash, but it is not recommended.

Heater controls on the manual heater/A/C system binding/breaking and there is a bulletin to correct this problem

SRS light that comes on intermittently this is a wiring connector issue and Saab has a sure fire repair to correct this.

Alarm Horn goes off for no reason, this is due to an internal fault in the horn, which has its own power supply.  The good part is that it will not kill your car battery.

Once you get beyond the bumps in the road this car is exceptional.  Power is delivered by a 2.0l turbo charged 4 cylinder that is very smooth.  I would recommend the automatic transmission, and never in the early 900 body.  The manual transmission is ok if you like to shift to say you are doing the shifting but this 5 speed gearbox is certainly not noted for smooth operation and neither is it trouble free.  The car is efficient and I have observed highway fuel economy of 32.5 mpg and that goes for the automatic as well as the manual.  The point I hope to bring across is that the automatic is not only reliable but it uses the cars engine performance curve remarkably well which translates into peaceful, smooth, relaxing driving.  

The suspension under the 9-3 is essentially the same as the 900 and for what it is designed for it functions well and never argues much with the driver when pushed hard.

There are performance accessories available for those who want to maximize the performance of the car or you could just drop the $40k and drive the Viggen off the showroom floor.

Creature comforts are better in the 9-3 as you can have audio controls in the wheel, rear seat heater, single latch system for the convertible, service reminders displayed on the SID can be reset by the owner.  The radio doesn't need to be coded if you disconnect the battery, which may seem trivial but it is a nice feature.  

What could be improved?  Audio components, storage compartments in the center console, a better rear fold down seat system, analog clock, ignition on the column, less annoying alarm system, lower replacement parts cost, easier tie rod adjustment, longer lasting exhaust system.

By and large this is a very good car when compared to the competition and the best way to buy is to pick up a program car through a Saab dealer.  All the cars are strictly maintained and will cost quite a bit less than new.

2000 models offer factory N/C maintenance, and the A/C system is quieter.
