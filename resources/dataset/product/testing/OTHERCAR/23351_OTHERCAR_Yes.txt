                 I recently had the opportunity to trade my 97 Chevy suburban for my brothers 2000 ML430 for a 4 day period, he had to tow a large boat &amp; I was more than happy to accommodate him. I found the ML430 to be a pleasure to drive. This vehicle handled like a sports car, held corners like it was part of the road &amp; had enough acceleration to merge into speeding LIE traffic at 70mph from very short on ramps.
     The dash board layout is very simple, all gauges were easily viewable from all seat positions. Seat, lock, window &amp; moonroof controls were all easily accessible &amp; user friendly. I found the in dash, outside temperature gauge to be extremely useful when the road was wet &amp; temps were hovering in the mid 30's. The seats were extremely comfortable &amp; I had plenty of headroom, even at 6'2&quot;.
     We also had the opportunity to take this vehicle on the beach, traditionally, we'd have to deflate the tires somewhat in order to keep from spinning &amp; sinking, but the ML430 didn't require that with the very wide, low profile tires. There also was no evidence of transmission fatigue after our beach run.
     The only problem I had was the overall lack of room. I have a wife &amp; 3 children &amp; we're used to the abundance of room in the large SUV. There wasn't enough room for fishing gear, bicycles &amp; incidentals. This machine wouldn't be suitable for a family trip with 5 or more people. Hopefully they'll roll out a larger version with all the same outstanding features. When they do, they'll have another customer! This machine is ideal for sporty couples &amp; families of 4 or less. <br><br>
