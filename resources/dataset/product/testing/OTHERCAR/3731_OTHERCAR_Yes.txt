            The Chevrolet silverado is a very dependable truck.  It rides smooth and is in my opinion one of the best trucks made.  Besides the truck being very reliable it has plunty of extra power from the 350 vorteck engine.  You should buy this truck becuase it is very dependable and is rugged enough to take you anywhere you need to go.  I can't think of a reason that you shouldn't buy this truck!  It is a great truck and is well worth the extra money you pay for it then settling for a ford or dodge truck.<br><br>
