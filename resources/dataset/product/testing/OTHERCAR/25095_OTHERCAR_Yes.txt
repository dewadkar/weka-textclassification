            This is a huge improvement over the old Blazer.  The 270 hp engine is powerful, pretty quiet, and does very well on gas.  I average about 18-19 mpg and can get about 21-22 on the highway.  The ride is very good, both on the highway and on our dirt road.  It is very quiet and smooth on the highway.

We have the base model, an LS, and the standard equipment is pretty generous.  Of the options that you cannot get on the LS, the only two that I really wish I could get on the LS are the fog lights and steering wheel controls for the radio and cruise.

The stereo kicks.  I have noticed, however, that it sounds much better sitting in the front as opposed to the back.  Maybe it's because there are 4 speakers up front and only 2 in the back.  Would be great if the CD player could read mp3 encoded CDs, but maybe that's asking for a bit much.

As for cons, they could've put a stalk on the right side of the steering column and put some functions there, like for the wipers and such. Because the gear shift is on the floor, it seems like there is just an empty unutilized space there.  It would be better to put the cruise control on the wheel too, instead of on the left stalk.  Still not sure if I like the seat mounted seat belts.

The rear seat is pretty roomy and comfortable, in the outboard positions.  The middle position is NOT comfortable or roomy at all, and it is very difficult to get the seat belt buckled in that position.  Also, no LATCH???  Manual says that Chevy does not recommend putting a child seat in the center position.  Why?

We've had a couple of first model year issues.  For one, the wash function for the rear wiper broke (needed new switch).  Also the actuator for the rear tailgate went.  Needed a new one of those.  Hmmm, had they put in a keyhole back there, I would've been able to open the tailgate manually.  A friend of ours who also has a 2002 LS had her gauges go out on her one day and she also had a problem with her 4WD.

***9/23/02 UPDATE***

We've had another warranty issue.  The truck shifted into 4wd by itself.  The dealer replaced the 4wd switch and upgraded the software.

***11/13/02 UPDATE***

The 4wd is acting up again - same issue as before where it was shifting into 4wd by itself.  The dealer again found the switch to be faulty and replaced it.  Hmmmmmm.....

***3/4/03 UPDATE***

Yet more warranty issues.  One of the headlamps went out.  More significant, however, is the fact that the rear defroster is only working for the upper half of the window.  Dealer is going to replace the entire window, because apparently the friction between the window and the rubber gasket of the tailgate caused some breaks in the defroster circuits - bad design???
