            I began looking for a digital camera almost a year ago.  I didn't want a whole lot of bells and whistles, but I did what high quality pictures and the ability to snap a whole bunch of them, without having to download first.  In my search I tested out quite a few cameras and I asked owners of all kinds general opinions.

Not wanting to spend $700 or more I was rather limited in my search, but then I found the Polaroid 640, on sale at my local department store.  It has absolutely everything I wanted in a camera.  There are three different settings, portrait, scenery and action, three flash settings, and three resolution settings.  You can snap 94 low grade pics or 26 high ones.  It has a LCD view finder, which is great for a quick peek at your pics, with it you can delete that picture you took of uncle Bob's bald head, or the one where you chopped off part of your grandma's head, without having to download them first.  But, beware, because using the LCD constantly takes a major bite out of your batteries.

The program that comes with the camera is a little bit childish, but very easy to use and has lots of neat things to do with the pictures, you can create screen savers, put your head onto Henry the eighth's body or even make cards and T-shirts.

All in all it is a magnificent buy.<br><br>
