<TEXT>
            The 1997 Accent I have is the fifth Hyundai I have owned.  In my previous employment I drove about 40,000 miles a year and for more than 6 years, and Hyundai got me there reliably and economically.  I currently travel, just not so much, and find the Accent to be a comfortable car for travel - the lumbar support on the driver's seat is wonderful, and the 38 mpg that I get on my 5-speed is terrific.  

My experience is that these cars handle well - my first was totaled when a car turned in front of me and I came away with a scratched shin.  So, I've stayed with them ever since.  The accents are roomier than their predecessor.  The one downside for me is that the GL I own does not have fold down rear seats that my other Hyundais have had.  This somewhat limits the type of cargo I can carry.<br><br>
