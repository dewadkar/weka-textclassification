            Wandering through Wal-Mart the other day looking for new toys to go with my new laptop, I ran across this little camera.  I already own a Polaroid digital camera, but the size of this thing was just "neat!"

I imagined myself walking around with this thing in my pocket snapping pictures of people when they least expected it.  But I soon found out that wasn't going to happen like I wanted.  The lighting has got to be just right for this thing to work.  I guess I'm spoiled by my regular digital which can be adjusted to low light conditions and my camcorder which does it automatically.  If it's too dark for this thing, it just beeps at you.  Yet I find it strange that I can hook up the USB cable to the computer and it sees just fine.  

It can be used as a regular still camera, a digital video recorder (when attached to computer) or even a web cam!  

Another hint: Don't believe epinions when they say the lowest price is over $50.  Wal-Mart carries them for $29.99.
