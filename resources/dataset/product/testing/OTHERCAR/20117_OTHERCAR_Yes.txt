            I bought this vehicle because it is the newest in the kind. This is not only the award winning BMW 5.40i,(which beat the top of the line Mercedes, Jaguar, Lexus, Cadillac, Buick, and Audi) yet its all that but a more sleek car. This car is very roomy and it is comfortable which I was suprised about because it was such a small car. What I'm saying is what else could u ask for? It's got speed, acceleration, horse power, and a nice smooth ride. I would recommend this to someone who likes attention because this will draw a lot of it. I would recommend this to someone who is going to be on the Autobon soon, because you can really SPEED IT UP! <br><br>
