            In looking for a new car recently, I test drove both the 2001 Toyota MR2 and its direct competitor, the 2001 Mazda Miata.  Considering that you can probably get out the door with an MR2 for only $2k more than a Miata, I can see no reason to even think about getting a Miata after having experienced them both.  The Mazda lot I visited was full of 2000 Miatas growing rust on the wheels, with huge rebates and financing deals to get them off the lot, and now I can see why.  If you're going to spend over $20k for a brand-new roadster, do it right.  For those that can't afford the Honda S2000, Porsche Boxster, or BMW Z3, the choice between the MR2 and the Miata should be a foregone conclusion.  I haven't driven any of these three, but I could see the MR2 possibly matching up well with a much pricier roadster like those -- and some of the reviews I've read have said that it does.

<b>1.  Driving experience:</b>  the MR2 was markedly more fun to drive than the Miata.  It seemed faster and more responsive, and the handling was unquestionably better.  The MR2 hugs the road, flies around curves and is just plain fun.  Some of the difference in ride also is in the suspension -- as others have mentioned, you feel every bump in the road in a Miata.  You're still going to feel more in an MR2 than you would in a big sedan or SUV of course (and what should you expect from a little roadster?), but the ride is much more comfortable.  The Miata feels cheaper and more primitive -- the suspension is much better than when I drove one a few years ago, but still not that great -- and doesn't corner anywhere near as well as the MR2.

<b>2.  Exterior look/coolness:</b>  the MR2 is definitely the way to go if you are concerned about this attribute at all.  People notice it a lot more (maybe in part because it's newer and more rare), and often confuse it with a Porsche.  It's wider and the curves are more manly than a Miata (anyone remember the yellow Miata in the movie &quot;Go&quot;?), and has attitude without being tacky.  It's just a cool car.  

<b>3.  Interior:</b>  the models I saw (and the one I drove) all had custom leather seats, which were very comfortable -- but I didn't get to see the mesh-covered cloth seats that come standard, which seem to have generated mixed feelings among various reviewers.  The dashboard is laid out well, and feels simple and functional, just what you want in this kind of car.  Go buy a limo if you want the in-dash 100-CD changer and the wet bar... this car is for driving instead.  It's a nice interior, although I would comment that the door handles are attempting to look a little too space-age, the carbon fiber dash (an option that was also on the models I looked at) is definitely an acquired taste (I don't really get it), and in some places you have plastic where you would rather see chrome.  Likewise in a couple of places on the exterior.  But these complaints are rather minor -- overall, it's a good design.  The Miata SEs with the chrome and wood trim were very nice, but then... you'd still be driving a Miata. 

<b>4. Cargo Space (or lack of it):</b>  As you've probably already read, the MR2 is a little low on cargo space.  The engine is in the trunk (no space there), and under the hood is the spare tire (there's a reasonable amount of space on top of it, for a backpack or small bag)... beyond that, there is a small area behind the two seats, accessed through two glove-box like lids, which gives you room for a large duffelbag perhaps.  And then there's the passenger seat if there's nobody riding with you.  This is in fact the main drawback of the MR2... it's not practical in any way.  It could still be manageable as a primary car, going to work, going out in the evenings, etc., as long as you had access through a spouse, relative or friend, to borrow a larger car when you actually had to go on a camping trip or move things.   The Miata does have a little more cargo space, with a small trunk, but you're not going to be hauling any furniture in that thing, either.

The MR2 is a great car for someone who likes to drive and appreciates style.  It's a great car also because it's much more affordable than most cars of this type, but still feels like you should be paying a premium.    <br><br>
