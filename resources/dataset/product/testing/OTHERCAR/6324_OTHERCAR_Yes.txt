            When I first saw the sienna I was disappointed of how it looked like compared to the previa. The look was appealing but I had no idea of how much Toyota improved its mini van. There were many differences that I had to get a little used to before I started to appreciate them.

The air conditioning is in separate compartments, one for each person so the circulation of air is better than having just one vent in the front-top of the vehicle.
The seats are removable if more space needed instead of just the front seat reclining to flatten. This removal of seats come very handy. Also, the front seats can recline all the way forward to become tables for the back seat passengers.
There are cup holders even for the front seat passengers instead of not having one at all.
There are compartments to keep belongings for each passenger. 

The only complaint I have is that the hand bag compartment in the front is a lot smaller, but this is for the issue of safety. The air bag is larger which results in les space for storing of possesions, but manageable. Also, the brake sometimes have a certain buzz to it which we have to get checked every not and then. The locks on the door sometimes break, and need to be unlocked oNLY by the driver's seat's controls. Just be careful not to slam the sliding door too hard as you may be used to doing from experience of other vans. With this van, the door slides right into place.

All in all, the previa is the perfect family car as you may have heard. Even if you dont have a family, its perfect or travelers. The fact that the seats can be removed can come very useful during your trips.<br><br>
