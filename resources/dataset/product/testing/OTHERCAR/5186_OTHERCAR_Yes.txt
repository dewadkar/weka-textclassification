            Wow, what a car.  if you hate car shopping, if you hate dealing with car dealers, this will sooth the pain.  When I bought this car I bought it for the looks, now I realize that I have in my possession a GEM!  Not only does it look great, it performs great with zippy acceleration.  The reliablity factor is second to none, Its a Honda product.  I really am expecting at least 250,000 miles out of this just like my Acura Integra.
  When the Accord does need service, it is relativley inexpensive
The interior is great, very comfortable leather seats, great sound system the ride is superb and the noise level is low enough to make you think you were in a Lexus!  For my money there is not much more bang for your buck then a used Accord.  I highly recomend taking the car to a certified mechanic before purchasing.  Just ad an added measure of security, it usually costs about 60-80 $  but is worth it if you find a car that is an absolute lemon!  Hope this helped you out happy shopping<br><br>
