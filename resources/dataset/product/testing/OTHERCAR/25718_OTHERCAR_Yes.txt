            I will start this review by apologizing for the fact that I am actually reviewing the original Beetle, not the New Beetle who's category this will be placed under.  This is due to the fact that, understandably due to its age, there is no specific category for the original Beetle.

Now that I got that out of the way, I loved this car.  What it lacked in luxury it made up for in personality.  It was perfect for what I was looking for, which was a cheap, old car to get me around for a few months.  OK so the exhaust leaked into the cabin, the radio didn't work, neither did the windshield wiper fluid and the clutch finally gave out this was a fun car!  

She was bright orange, with gray primer over the wheel wells, and had rust spots dotting the body.  Since she was the "Super Beetle" she had the 1600 cc engine.  There wasn't much super about that engine, despite the near weightlessness of the vehicle it still struggled to reach over 80 mph.  The size of the car didn't help when reaching top speed either.  When at speeds over 70 mph she would shift inside the tire grooves on the highway due to the fact that its wheel base is smaller than the average cars on the road.  

The interior showed the worse for wear, the dashboard was cracked and the seats torn in places.  The major cosmetic eye sore was that the material that covers the dome was missing(the previous owner had removed it due to it sagging.)  But none of these complaints are the fault of Volkswagon, but a lack of maintenance on a very dated piece of machinery.  The steering wheel and the shifter were niece looking though, both after market volksberg edition.  There would be a heavy gasoline smell when the tank was over 75% full.  This was a missing or degraded seal, an easy fix if I was to bother, again not a manufacturing error.

Other than the previously mentioned horizontal movement at high speeds, the car handled wonderfully.  I scared my friends more than once whipping around corners and having the back end kicking out and fishtailing.  The rear engine placement gives the car a go-cart feel.  Being a standard four speed, made it easy to drop in gears to overload the tires while taking a 90% turn.  Its small size helped it fit into small places for parking or passing on a dense highway.  It also had a very wide wheel base, for its size, which helped it take turns at any speed the engine could get it up to.

The engine ran great, but it wasn't original.  It was an original from some Super Beetle, just not that one.  The previous owner had swapped it out.  When I bought the car the engine sputerd between first and second gears.  But it only took some carb cleaner, which cost all of $3 a bottle, and she purred for the duration of my owning her.  I think the engine had upwords of 150k miles.  I'm not sure because the odometer didn't work.

As far as interior space was concerned it was actually surprisingly roomy.  I could fit four, five if I had to, into the car.  Considering its size on the outside one might think the backseat was just for looks.  The wasn't much luggage room, but the hood of the car(as the engine is in the trunk) helped if there was no spare to take up space.  It was enough for getting groceries and other day to day needs.  I wouldn't recommend it for families, which is actually what my parents had back in 1973 and carted myself and my brother around in.  Their's was only a base model Beetle, not a Super Beetle, and was also painted in primer, I think this is a trend specific to my family, not Beetle's in general.

A great car if you are looking for something with as few moving parts as possible.  Everything is easy to fix if you have the tools and the time.  Not to mention the parts are dirt cheap.  A good car to restore as the fetch a good price when they are brought back to shape and you can buy them cheap.  Insurance is low as can be expected and it gets decent gas mileage despite its age, drinking somewhere around gallon for every 20 miles.  The breaks are more than powerful enough for a car its size.  I wouldn't envy someone who gets into a wreck with it, since there isn't very much room between you and anything moving at you.  But if you are looking for a project car or just a "beater" not a bad place to go, and there is always someone interested in taking it off you hands when you move on to the next best thing.
